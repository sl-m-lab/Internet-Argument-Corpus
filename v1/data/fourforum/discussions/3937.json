And rather than answering the question, you assumed I had an anwer and responded to that. Assumptions, re-read the question without assuming I have an answer in mind, then answer it. You will see it as a different posts.\n\n \n Quite correct, I did make an assumption based on what I know about your position on the subject.\n \n However, the point is still the same. The question faces the fallacy of inconsistency if one assumes there is no god. If one assumes that there is a God, same logical fallacy applies as God is the one who determines what happens and whether or not it is right to happen that way. So, as to what happens, I can answer that no more than I can answer what will happen for you. \n \n Final destination is a determination made by God and God alone, from my viewpoint. If there is no God then the question really is moot and shouldn't be asked at all.\n \n In fact, when the bible speaks of judgement, it speaks of this very thing, a determination of good or evil, heaven or hell. The bible also says that men are not to judge for judgement is left to GOd. \n \n So, in summary, If I believe in God, then I cannot answer the question because it is a question only GOd can answer. If I don't believe in god, then who cares.",

A traditional, typically ancient story dealing with supernatural beings, ancestors, or heroes that serves as a fundamental type in the worldview of a people, as by explaining aspects of the natural world or delineating the psychology, customs, or ideals of society: the myth of Eros and Psyche; a creation myth. \n \n 2. Such stories considered as a group: the realm of myth. \n \n 3. A popular belief or story that has become associated with a person, institution, or occurrence, especially one considered to illustrate a cultural ideal: a star whose fame turned her into a myth; the pioneer myth of suburbia. \n \n 4. A fiction or half-truth, especially one that forms part of an ideology. \n \n 5.A fictitious story, person, or thing: \"German artillery superiority on the Western Front was a myth\" (Leon Wolff). \n \n account ( P ) Pronunciation Key (-kount)\n n. \n \n 1. A narrative or record of events. \n \n 2. A reason given for a particular action or event: What is the account for this loss? \n \n 3. A report relating to one's conduct: gave a satisfactory account of herself. \n \n 4. A basis or ground: no reason to worry on that account. \n Abbr. a/c or acct.\n \n So, firstly, it would seem that myth doesn't necessarily equal fiction, though I do agree with you that it does imply fiction.\n \n I'd say the story of Adam and Eve jives far more closely with a number of the meanings of myth than it does with #1 of account.\n \n Myth is a common term applied to any religion, either past or present, that doesn't jive with the Bible and Christianity, and yet both yourself and EZ seem to take offense to it when it is applied under the same circumstances to your beliefs.\n \n Waxy",

Just like greek gods, it is a matter of belief. It cannot be proven one way or the other. That does not make it a myth, simply unproven. There are many postulates in mathematics that cannot be proven but are hardly mythical. Division by zero equals infinity. Or so we say. Infinity is only a concept and not a number. To state it is equal to anything is (logically) meaningless. However, we use it in higher mathematics all the time. The square root of a negative number (or any even root of a negative number) is an imaginary number. Mythical? We use it in calculating the real roots on all kinds of problems. A lack of proof is not proof of the negative, especially in issues of faith. It is simply a lack of proof.\n \n If the affirmative claims that adam and eve are real people and says they can prove it.............yipes. If the negative says \"no they are not\" and says they can prove it............yipes. Would the negative win the argument by asking for proof? Only if the affirmative provides zero evidence. If the afffirmative provides weak evidence only then a claim that the evidence is weak without counter evidence will still lose the argument. The negative has to produce more convincing evidence than the affirmative. In issues of faith, this is simply not possible.\n \n Therefore, one cannot prove something by pointing out the lack of proof for something. Just because I don't produce evidence for little green men from mars, does not mean they don't exist, it only means I did not provide evidence.\n \n Is that understandable to anyone? I feel I may not be being very clear at the moment?",

   "I think the problem being dealt with here is one of belief. Just like greek gods, it is a matter of belief. It cannot be proven one way or the other. That does not make it a myth, simply unproven. There are many postulates in mathematics that cannot be proven but are hardly mythical. Division by zero equals infinity. Or so we say. Infinity is only a concept and not a number. To state it is equal to anything is (logically) meaningless. However, we use it in higher mathematics all the time. The square root of a negative number (or any even root of a negative number) is an imaginary number. Mythical? We use it in calculating the real roots on all kinds of problems. A lack of proof is not proof of the negative, especially in issues of faith. It is simply a lack of proof.\n \n If the affirmative claims that adam and eve are real people and says they can prove it.............yipes. If the negative says \"no they are not\" and says they can prove it............yipes. Would the negative win the argument by asking for proof? Only if the affirmative provides zero evidence. If the afffirmative provides weak evidence only then a claim that the evidence is weak without counter evidence will still lose the argument. The negative has to produce more convincing evidence than the affirmative. In issues of faith, this is simply not possible.\n \n Therefore, one cannot prove something by pointing out the lack of proof for something. Just because I don't produce evidence for little green men from mars, does not mean they don't exist, it only means I did not provide evidence.\n \n Is that understandable to anyone? I feel I may not be being very clear at the moment?\n\n \n It's very clear, and is essentially what I (and others as well) was trying to get across to Easyrider.\n \n The problem I see with this, and it's more of a problem for believers, is that it essentially reduces the Bible to a common story, one that can't be proven to be true, no better or worse than that of Norse or Greek accounts of their gods, or for that matter, unicorns and little green men. It means that all Christians must admit that they cannot state with certainty that Bible is \"true\". (Ultimately pointing at agnosticism.)\n \n I'm fine with that, as I'm more than satisfied to place the accounts of Adam and Eve, Noah, etc... within the Bible on the same plane as the accounts of Norse mythology, unicorns and little green men. Not impossible, but not real likely either. \n \n The hypocrisy lies in the manner in which Christians are so quick to dismiss these other writings as myth, when in fact, they are every bit as valid given your explanation above.\n \n Personally, I feel the burden is on Christians to prove the Bible true. Christianity, or more specifically a belief in God, is learned, it is not innate. \n \n Therefore, it would seem to me that if you want to convert others and make them believe that the Bible is the actual literal truth and word of God, the burden of proof rests squarely with those that believe.\n \n Waxy",

   "i just saw this, and it should clear up what i asked in the other post...\n \n the dilema sounds like questioning whether you should mentally force yourself to believe in something you have doubts about. of course, that in itself is a contradiction: believing something you doubt. its either you believe it or you doubt it\n \n i understand the intellectual integrity though. its like christianity in its true sense goes against standard logic and reason. its like actually a realm outside of reason. thats exactly what it is. christianity requires no reason, only faith. however, it doesnt require you to abandon all reason, it just doesnt require you to exercise reason. i hope that makes sense\n \n christianity itself is outside of reason. from the time you need to entertain concepts such as spirituality, an eternal soul, and even God himself, its totally faith-based. the rules of logic are not needed\n \n basically, accepting christianity doesnt mean losing reason, it means gaining faith\n\n \n It's actually a rather simple question - what is my ultimate fate given that I undertook a good-faith effort to investigate Christianity and eventually discovered that I could not, in good conscience (i.e., being true to myself), embrace Christianity? I can think of two possibilites: 1) the Christian god will consign me to eternal damnation, or 2) Christianity is not the only valid path to God. \n \n Your above comments seem to suggest that in order for me to embrace Christianity, I may need to suspend my own sense of logic and reason. Problem is, I can't do that because, in effect, that would amount to 'faking' it or otherwise parking my brains in the closet.\n \n So, why don't you give it another shot!",

So, then, this tribal god of the Hebrews orders them to kill all the captured Midianite men and women and all the little Midianite boys, but that the Hebrews are to keep the virginal little girls for themselves. The first question which pops into my mind is, how did the Hebrews determine which of those little girls were virgins? But a more important question is, did God actually order such a thing? And if so, what kind of god is this? Is such a god deserving of respect or worship? Then again, this entire account may very well be fictional and I certainly hope that to be the case. If, OTOH, it reflects reality, then I can only conclude that people can often be induced to carry out all manner of evil acts once they are convinced that they are following God's command, and if there are spoils to be taken (including virginal girls), all the better. \n \n Just as an aside, every once in awhile I come across some horrible news story wherein a parent, usually a mother, kills her children and later asserts that God told her to do it.",

   "IMO, there's absolutely zero archaeological, historical, or traditional evidence for the JEPD hypothesis.\n\n \n The evidence on which the Documentary Hypothesis is based is contained within the Torah itself. This has previously been explained to you. That evidence consists of, among other things, the presence of differing literary styles, the presence of anachronisms, and the presence of a considerable number of doublets (a doublet is the telling of a story twice). Many of those doublets contain contradiction and many of them evidence bias (in one or the other pair) toward either the kingdom of Israel or the kingdom of Judah. \n \n As examples of anachronism...\n \n An account of Moses' death and burial (Deut. 34:5-6).\n \n and...\n \n Deut 34:10 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses.. (notice the word 'since')\n \n A partial list of Torah doublets...\n \n Creation - The account of creation in Gen. 1:1-2:3 is followed by a second creation story in Gen. 2.4b-25. The two versions duplicate each other in some respects but contradict each other in other respects (the order of creation, for example). Note also, that in this and many other following doublets, one of the pair of doublets consistently refers to God as \"God\" while the other refers to God as \"Lord God\". \n \n Genealogy from Adam - Gen. 4:17-26 and 5:1-28.\n \n The flood - Two complete versions of the flood story are intertwined: Gen. 6:5-8; 7:1-5, 7, 10, 12, 16b-20, 22-23; 8:2b-3a, 6, 8, 8-12, 13b, 20-22 and 6:9-22; 7:8-9, 11, 13-16a, 21, 24; 8:1-2a, 3b-5, 7, 13a, 14-19; 9:1-17. There exist significant differences between these two versions. \n \n Genealogy from Shem - Gen. 10:21-31 and 11:10-26.\n \n Abraham's migration - Gen. 12:1-4a and 12:4b-5.\n \n The Abrahamic covenant - Gen. 15 and 17.\n \n Joseph sold into Egypt - Gen. 37;2b, 3b, 5-11, 19-20, 23, 25b-27, 28b, 31-35; 39;1 and 37:3a, 4, 12-18, 21-22, 24, 25a, 28a, 29-30.\n \n Manna and quail in the wilderness - Exd. 16:2-3, 6-35a; Num. 11:4-34.\n \n Water from a rock at Meribah - Exd. 17:2-7; Num. 20:2-13.\n \n The Decalog - Exd. 20:1-17 and 34:10-28 and Deut. 5:6-18.\n \n Appointment of Joshua - Num. 27:12-23; Deut. 31:14-15, 23.\n \n Centralization of sacrifice - Lev. 17 and Deut. 12.\n \n Forbidden animals - Lev. 11 and Deut. 14.\n \n Source: Anchor Bible Dictionary, Volume Six, Doubleday Pub.",

   "The use of Hebrews to build Egyptian pyramids is documented in Egyptian documentation. The term used was the 'Apiru. Ramseses II's successor, Merneptah, bragged about his defeat of Israel in Canaan in the Stele of Merneptah, a stone tablet dated ~1220 BC., so there is \"evidence\" that significant numbers of Hebrews existed in Egypy during that time.\n\n \n I'm typing off the top of my head here because I don't have my references at hand. We have a number of Late Bronze Age Egyptian inscriptions describing the migration into Egypt of 'people from the north' in search of labour. It may have been seasonal and it may have been linked to periodic famine in places such as Canaan. Anybody's guess. \n \n Yes, the Stele of Merneptah celebrates the defeat by Egyptians of who are assumed to have been Hebrews in Canaan. This would make sense because the Egyptians had fortifications not only in Sinai but also throughout Canaan all the way up to the border of what is now Syria. The various kinglets in that region paid tribute to Egypt in return for protection. But this, in my view, does not provide evidence of a concentration of Hebrews living in Egypt proper. \n \n \nHere's an interesting read for you. \"Understanding the Old Testament\" by Bernhard W.

The Plege of Allegiance is to the flag and to the Republic for which it stands. \"Under God\" is simply one of the descriptives which define our nation's heritage. That is in no way an establishment of religion.\n \n\n yes but it specifically implies that there is a god and we are under him.\n \n \n\n Next, in \"U.S. Supreme Court - ABINGTON SCHOOL DIST. v. SCHEMPP, 374 U.S. 203 (1963), it was noted that, \"We agree of course that the State may not establish a \"religion of secularism\" in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus \"preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.\"  Zorach v. Clauson, supra, at 314.

Kurtzman (1971) the court ruled an action must pass 3 points.\n \n 1. The purpose of the aid must be clearly secular, not religious\n 2. Its primary effect must neither advance nor inhibit religion\n 3. It must avoid an excessive entanglement of government with religion\n \n So basically it must remain secular.\n \n \n\n Third, Congress shall also make no laws restricting the \"free exercise of\" (religion). With paid Congressional chaplains, reliefs of the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court, a Congressional Bible previously authorized, printed, and paid for by Congress, and hundreds of other examples, modern day liberals have gone off the deep end with their failed \"establishment\" arguments. God is a historical reality in the founding of America, and no amount of secular revisionism is going to change that. \n \n\n That's what they thought when blacks were slaves, look what happened there.\n \n \n\n What is an establishment of religion? It must have a creed defining what a man must believe; it must have rites and ordinances which believers must observe; it must have ministers of defined qualifications to teach the doctrines and administer the rites; it must have tests for the submissive penalties for the nonconformist. There never was an established religion without all these.\n \n\n Unfortunately the Supreme Court has disagreed with you there.

They are not gay.\n \n But when it comes down to it, you can't make such an irrational statement about AIDS being a gay disease without some support, right? Let me hear some statistics to back you up.\n\n \n I did send you to the statistics that backed up my statement. If you'd have read your references above, you would have seen that, in the first article, from Jamaica, not the US, stated that married women were believed to be contracting AIDS from unfaithful husbands engaging in homosexual sex on the side. That hardly supports your claim. ;)\n Your second source is highly questionable. While it talks about the other means of transmission, such as sharing needles, it gives little info on the relative rates of contraction between gay and non-gay victims. And why would it? It is after all from a group called \"From AIDS Survival Project\n A coalition of people affected by HIV March 1999\" You would expect it to paint gays in a more favorable light. emoticon_rolleyes \n And your third reference is a bunch of \"feel good\" propaganda.\n You wanted facts, I'll give you some facts:\n \n \n\n High-Risk Sexual Behavior by HIV-Positive Men Who Have Sex with Men --- 16 Sites, United States, 2000--2002\n \n The majority of persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States are men who have sex with men (MSM) (1). High-risk sexual behavior by HIV-positive MSM exposes sex partners to HIV. The risk for transmitting HIV from an infected partner to an uninfected partner through unprotected insertive anal intercourse (UIAI) is greater than the risk for transmission through receptive anal intercourse or oral sex (2). Differences in sexual risk behavior might be associated with the perceived HIV serostatus of the partner (i.e., HIV positive, HIV negative, or unknown serostatus) (3), as well as with the sex partner type (i.e., steady or nonsteady [4]). During May 2000--December 2002, HIV-positive MSM were interviewed in a behavioral surveillance survey at surveillance sites in 16 states*. This report describes insertive anal intercourse practices reported by these MSM; findings indicated that a large percentage of HIV-positive MSM were sexually abstinent, practiced safer sexual behavior by having protected insertive anal intercourse, or had UIAI with an HIV-positive partner. However, a small percentage of HIV-positive MSM reported UIAI with partners who were HIV negative or whose serostatus was unknown; for this group, more intensive and comprehensive HIV-prevention efforts are needed to eliminate this risk behavior... \n References:\n 1 CDC.

   "JP,\n \nCertainly. Not everyone agrees with 100% of any religion's dogma. There are lots of pro-choice Catholics, for example. Look at John Kerry or Ted Kennedy. While I wouldn't call either a \"good\" Catholic, they are Catholics none-the-less.\n And there are probably more Catholics actively practicing birth control than not practicing birth control, even though the Catholic Church has stated that abstinence is the only acceptable form of birth control.\n I know Jews who will, on occasion, eat pork and I'm sure that there are Muslims who occasionally eat beef.\n\n \n I must say that in observing your arguments in the abortion and religious forums, they are always very sound and most often better than simply sound. But I think you are mistaken when you speak of dogma as something that can be taken or left. I think you are re-defining the definition of dogma and in so doing would not be long in re-defining dogma. There are many things about which Catholics can disagree with the Church, dogma is not one of those. Can one, for instance, deny the doctrine of the Trinity and remain Catholic? Can he deny that Mary was the Mother of God and not simply the mother of Jesus' manhood? Is the Resurrection a dogma open to debate? One who does not follow dogma is not a Catholic but rather a heretic. It would be similar, though not as serious, to call a Democrat a Republican simply because he has registered as one (or fancies himself to be one), though he continues to hold all the tenets of the Democratic party. It would be like calling a football player a baseball player simply because one likes the word baseball better than football.\n \n When one denies dogma than he severs himself from the unity of the Church. And the Catholic Church is the one unified Church in the world, unity being a principle feature of it. \"When they are proposed or defined by the Church, and thus become dogmas, we are bound to believe them in order to maintain the bond of faith.\" quoted from www.newadvent.org under the subject \"Dogma\"\n \n \"The Church's Magisterium exercises the authority it holds from Christ  to the fullest extent when it defines dogmas, that is, when it proposes, in a form obliging the Christian people to an irrevocable adherence of faith, truths contained in divine Revelation or also when it proposes, in a definitive way, truths having a necessary connection with these.\" Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraph 88\n \n But there is nothing restricting in dogma except a restriction in the most important and good things. In this is not really a restriction but a freedom. \"Catholic doctrine and discipline may be walls; but they are the walls of a playground.\" G.K. Chesterton in Orthodoxy\n \n Furthermore, the Church states that formal cooperation in abortion is a grave offense carrying the penalty of excommunication. Regarding laws permitting abortions, it is written in Evangelium Vitae (73)  that it is \"never licit to obey it, or to take part in a propaganda campaign in favor of such a law, or to vote for it.\" Although Kerry was proposed as a \"Catholic\" candidate he was nothing of the sort. I have described him from the beginning as the Anti-Catholic candidate. \n \n Now, it is true when you say that there are more Catholics practicing use of artificial contraception than there are not practicing it. But because the majority practices it does not make it right. As Chesterton says, \"Right is right, even if nobody does it. Wrong is wrong even if everybody is wrong about it.\" Illustrated London News  May 1907 (from The Apostle of Common Sense  by Dale Ahlquist) (To be thorough, abstinence is not fully what the Church teaches on birth control either. It is more a question of chastity rather than a strict abstinence. Natural Family Planning is the mode that the Catholic Church allows and it requires abstinence at times but allows participation in the marital act at other times).\n \n I cannot speak to the Muslim and Jewish teachings on eating pork.

There are many things about which Catholics can disagree with the Church, dogma is not one of those.\n\n First, thanks for the compliment. Second, I think that your definition of dogma is unnecessarily restrictive while mine is more general. For example, the dictionary definition of dogma is\"\n \n 1 A doctrine or a corpus of doctrines relating to matters such as morality and faith, set forth in an authoritative manner by a church.\n 2 An authoritative principle, belief, or statement of ideas or opinion, especially one considered to be absolutely true. See Synonyms at doctrine.\n 3 A principle or belief or a group of them: \"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present\" (Abraham Lincoln).\"\n \n If you only consider definition #1, then I'd be more inclined to agree with your conclusions. But, I would include dogma to also include the way in which the Church itself functions. For example, it is Catholic dogma that priests can't marry or that women can't become priests. There is no Biblical law stating that either condition has to exist. It is a Catholic manifestation. There is no Biblical law stating that the Pope is infallable in matters dealing with faith. In fact, there is no Biblical basis for the existence of a pope. Again, that is exclusively the domain of Catholicism.\n \n\n Can one, for instance, deny the doctrine of the Trinity and remain Catholic? Can he deny that Mary was the Mother of God and not simply the mother of Jesus' manhood?

If the Catholic Church itself can't uphold its own \"dogma\", then how can it expect its followers to do so? If Catholic dogma states that being pro-abortion is grounds for ex-communication, than all pro-choice Catholics should be ex-communicated. End of story.\n \n\n Now, it is true when you say that there are more Catholics practicing use of artificial contraception than there are not practicing it.

It is more a question of chastity rather than a strict abstinence. Natural Family Planning is the mode that the Catholic Church allows and it requires abstinence at times but allows participation in the marital act at other times).\n\n I'm very familiar with Catholic doctrine regarding contraception. Pope Paul VI 's 1968 encyclical letter Humanae Vitae declared that contraception was \"any action which, either in anticipation of the conjugal act [sexual intercourse], or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible\".\n Now, under that strict definition, even withdrawal isn't allowed. My question to you is, in practice, how many Catholics do you know that have been ex-communicated for practicing safe sex, using the pill, condoms or practicing withdrawal? I don't know of any.\n \n\n I cannot speak to the Muslim and Jewish teachings on eating pork. But the Catholic prohibitions on eating meat and fasting do not fall in the category of dogma although they must be followed in obedience by the faithful. That falls under a discipline of the Church, I believe.\n Peace.\n\n \n And I would argue that not eating meat on Fridays falls in the category of Catholic dogma that isn't directly traceable back to the Bible.\n And Peace to you, also.",

I think you are both attributing more to the Catholic teaching on infallibility than is there. Not everything the pope does or says is infallible. (Hopefully, you are not confusing infallibility with impeccability.) Also, not all encyclicals or everything in an encyclical are infallible nor is everything in an ecumenical council infallible. Certain conditions must be met for a teaching to be considered infallible. \n \n \"EXPLANATION OF PAPAL INFALLIBILITY \n \n The Vatican Council has defined as \"a divinely revealed dogma\" that \"the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra -- that is, when in the exercise of his office as pastor and teacher of all Christians he defines, by virtue of his supreme Apostolic authority, a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by the whole Church -- is, by reason of the Divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, possessed of that infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer wished His Church to be endowed in defining doctrines of faith and morals; and consequently that such definitions of the Roman Pontiff are irreformable of their own nature (ex sese) and not by reason of the Church's consent\" (Densinger no. 1839 -- old no. 1680). For the correct understanding of this definition it is to be noted that: \n \n what is claimed for the pope is infallibility merely, not impeccability or inspiration (see above under I). \n \n the infallibility claimed for the pope is the same in its nature, scope, and extent as that which the Church as a whole possesses; his ex cathedra teaching does not have to be ratified by the Church's in order to be infallible.\n \n infallibility is not attributed to every doctrinal act of the pope, but only to his ex cathedra teaching; and the conditions required for ex cathedra teaching are mentioned in the Vatican decree: \n \n The pontiff must teach in his public and official capacity as pastor and doctor of all Christians, not merely in his private capacity as a theologian, preacher ar allocutionist, nor in his capacity as a temporal prince or as a mere ordinary of the Diocese of Rome. It must be clear that he speaks as spiritual head of the Church universal. \n \n Then it is only when, in this capacity, he teaches some doctrine of faith or morals that he is infallible (see below, IV). \n \n Further it must be sufficiently evident that he intends to teach with all the fullness and finality of his supreme Apostolic authority, in other words that he wishes to determine some point of doctrine in an absolutely final and irrevocable way, or to define it in the technical sense (see DEFINITION). These are well-recognized formulas by means of which the defining intention may be manifested. \n \n Finally for an ex cathedra decision it must be clear that the pope intends to bind the whole Church. To demand internal assent from all the faithful to his teaching under pain of incurring spiritual shipwreck (naufragium fidei) according to the expression used by Pius IX in defining the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. Theoretically, this intention might be made sufficiently clear in a papal decision which is addressed only to a particular Church; but in present day conditions, when it is so easy to communicate with the most distant parts of the earth and to secure a literally universal promulgation of papal acts, the presumption is that unless the pope formally addresses the whole Church in the recognized official way, he does not intend his doctrinal teaching to be held by all the faithful as ex cathedra and infallible.\" from www.newadvent.org under the search \"infallibility\" \n \n You can also check this explanation:\n http://www.catholic.com/library/Papal_Infallibility.asp \n \n Billsco, did you see my Chestertonian response to you concerning free thinking?

   "JP,\n \nFirst, thanks for the compliment. Second, I think that your definition of dogma is unnecessarily restrictive while mine is more general. For example, the dictionary definition of dogma is\"\n \n 1 A doctrine or a corpus of doctrines relating to matters such as morality and faith, set forth in an authoritative manner by a church.\n 2 An authoritative principle, belief, or statement of ideas or opinion, especially one considered to be absolutely true. See Synonyms at doctrine.\n 3 A principle or belief or a group of them: \"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present\" (Abraham Lincoln).\"\n \n If you only consider definition #1, then I'd be more inclined to agree with your conclusions. But, I would include dogma to also include the way in which the Church itself functions. For example, it is Catholic dogma that priests can't marry or that women can't become priests. There is no Biblical law stating that either condition has to exist. It is a Catholic manifestation. There is no Biblical law stating that the Pope is infallable in matters dealing with faith. In fact, there is no Biblical basis for the existence of a pope. Again, that is exclusively the domain of Catholicism.\n\n It is not my definition of dogma. It is the Church's   definition from its official teaching, the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Therefore, this is the definition by which the Church operates in its treatment of dogma.\n \n When you say that celibacy is a \"Catholic manifestation\" and that infallibility of the Pope is in the domain of Catholicism then you aren't quite right. Both are generated from the Revelation of Christ given to the Church to protect and convey. So though these two things are currently only in the realm of Catholicism, they used to be part of all of Christianity  when Christianity was all Catholic. Do not blame the Catholics if these things are currently only a \"Catholic manifestation.\" Blame the Protestants who chose some Christian manifestations and threw out others.\n \n You state that there is no biblical law  on celibacy or women priests which may be true. But this is not the same thing as saying there is no scriptural support for it. I can readily provide you with scriptural support for it if you wish. (And always remember that not everything that the Church teaches is explicit in scripture but nothing that it teaches is in opposition to scripture).\n \n You then say go further in discussing papal infallibility to say that there is no biblical basis for the existence of a pope. Unfortunately, you are wrong again. Look at this link that I posted on another thread and you will find an abundance of scriptural support for the papacy:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=38613&highlight=peter+rock#post38613 \n \n But if we go further to dissect your statements then we will see that you do not sound Catholic, as you professed you were. But you rather sound like a Fundamentalist who believes in the doctrine of sola scriptura. It has never been the position of the Church to provide every speck of evidence for its ritual, discipline, and dogma from the Bible alone. The Church rests on a three legged stool: Scripture, Tradition, and the teaching authority of the Church (the Magisterium). And although I contest your assertions that the Bible tells us nothing about celibacy, women priests, and the papacy, I could concede that to you. For if the Bible told us nothing, we would still have the living, organic   2,000 year young, Tradition and Teaching of the Church that has told us much on these subjects. These two facets of Christianity have been there with scripture from the beginning of Christianity.\n \n \nAgain, your definition of dogma is more restrictive than the one I used.\n\n And I am glad it is so restrictive. We should all be thankful that my definition is so restrictive. Because it was in this restriction that the Church was kept universal. It is a paradox well described by Chesterton. You see, each heresy was an attempt to take one little aspect of Christianity and uphold it as the only tenet of Christianity. Heresy was an attempt to narrow the religion when dogma often gets that spurious label. But the Church preserved the truth for all men   with dogma by protecting it from a few men. The Church preserved the truth for mankind by correcting  some men   who were heretics.\n \n If you didn't see me post this on the other thread then here is an insightful view of dogma that Chesterton put forth in The Everlasting Man:\n \n \"There will be no end to the weary debates about liberalising theology, until people face the fact that the only liberal part of it is really the dogmatic part. If dogma is incredible, it is because it is incredibly liberal. If it is irrational, it can only be in giving us more assurance of freedom than is justified by reason. The obvious example is that essential form of freedom which we call free-will. It is absurd to say that a man shows his liberality in denying his liberty. But it is tenable that he has to affirm a transcendental doctrine in order to affirm his liberty. There is a sense in which we might reasonably say that if a man has a primary power of choice, he has in that fact a supernatural power of creation, as if he could raise the dead or give birth to the unbegotten. Possibly in that case a man must be a miracle; and certainly in that case he must be a miracle in order to be a man; and most certainly in order to be a free man. But it is absurd to forbid him to be a free man and do it in the name of a more free religion...\n \n What the denouncer of dogma really means is not that dogma is bad; but rather that dogma is too good to be true. That is, he means that dogma is too liberal to be likely. Dogma gives man too much freedom when it permits him to fall. Dogma gives even God too much freedom when it permits him to die. That is what the intelligent sceptics ought to say; and it is not in the least my intention to deny that there is something to be said for it. They mean that the universe is itself a universal prison; that existence itself is a limitation and a control; and it is not for nothing that they call causation a chain. In a word, they mean quite simply that they cannot believe these things; not in the least that they are unworthy of belief. We say, not lightly but very literally, that the truth has made us free. They say that it makes us so free that it cannot be the truth. To them it is like believing in fairyland to believe in such freedom as we enjoy. It is like believing in men with wings to entertain the fancy of men with wills. It is like accepting a fable about a squirrel in conversation with a mountain to believe a man who is free to ask or a God who is free to answer. This is a manly and a rational negation for which I for one shall always show respect. But I decline to show any respect for those who first of all clip the wings and cage the squirrel, rivet the chains and refuse the freedom, close all the doors of the cosmic prison on us with a clang of eternal iron, tell us that our emancipation is a dream and our dungeon a necessity; and then calmly turn round and tell us they have a freer thought and a more liberal theology.\"\n \n \nI believe that the Church is quite clear on its position on abortion, but it was unwilling to press that position and ex-cmmunicate Kerry when he professed his support for it. If the Catholic Church itself can't uphold its own \"dogma\", then how can it expect its followers to do so? If Catholic dogma states that being pro-abortion is grounds for ex-communication, than all pro-choice Catholics should be ex-communicated. End of story.\n\n You might be on to something. Excommunication for these pro-choice Catholics might be a very good idea. But we have seen recently that the Church is acting on this issue by denying the Eucharist. And there is actually a formal canonical suit against Kerry for excommunication brought forth by a lay canonical lawyer on the basis of Kerry promoting heresy. You can probably find it on a web search.\n \n But the Church does state that formal cooperation in the act of abortion is a self ex-communication (Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) paragraph 2272). How can one be in communion- common union  with the Church-if he differs on a subject as important as the killing of the unborn? \n \n \nI'm very familiar with Catholic doctrine regarding contraception. Pope Paul VI 's 1968 encyclical letter Humanae Vitae declared that contraception was \"any action which, either in anticipation of the conjugal act [sexual intercourse], or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible\".\n Now, under that strict definition, even withdrawal isn't allowed. My question to you is, in practice, how many Catholics do you know that have been ex-communicated for practicing safe sex, using the pill, condoms or practicing withdrawal? I don't know of any.\n\n I'm very familiar with Catholic doctrine regarding contraception.

My question to you is, in practice, how many Catholics do you know that have been ex-communicated for practicing safe sex, using the pill, condoms or practicing withdrawal? I don't know of any. \n \n Humanae Vitae  is a great document, isn't it?\n \n I'm not sure that excommunication for contraception would be practical but I do believe it would be within the Church's right. The Church has chosen to teach, encourage, and exhort in this matter though. As it always attempts before resorting to more desperate measures. Excommunication is always a last resort and used sparingly to show the seriousness of it.\n \n You are right, withdrawal isn't allowed. It never has been. I don't see why it would be-it is a contraceptive act. You can find your biblical support for this all the way back in Genesis when the authors write about the Sin of Onan. (Genesis 38:8-10)\n \n No Catholics have been excommunicated for this but it is a grave sin according to the teaching of the Church. As Chesterton's quote attested, right is not made right by how many do it. The problem with contraception is not really that it is a sin and people ostentatiously disobey it. The problem is that they have forgotten that it is a sin at all or think there is no other way to manage their family size. \n \n Being that this is a sin, it should be confessed in the confessional. If this is done, then the priest has a right to withhold absolution due to a continual unrepentant state (the power to forgive or retain as scripture says). Granted, it might be better for him to educate the person on the beauty and fullness of the Church teaching on contraception and its alternative. It might be better for him to encourage the person to trust and be faithful even in the \"small\" but difficult things.\n \n \nAnd I would argue that not eating meat on Fridays falls in the category of Catholic dogma that isn't directly traceable back to the Bible.\n And Peace to you, also.\n\n Have you ever read about people fasting in the Bible?\n \n As bootfitter says and as I have said previously, celibacy/women priests/abortion/ and eating meat deal with disciplines and moral issues of the Church. None of these things have been pronounced as dogma. (Although, I do believe that John Paul II has said somewhere that celibacy is such an essential part of the revelation of faith that it is not open to debate or change. I'll have to search for that). \n \n And before you say excommunication is not a part of the Bible I will preemptively beg to differ. It is there. Paul excommunicated a member of the early Church.\n \n Happy New Year!",

   "Jito,\n \nHistorically you are correct, doesn't mean I have to bore myself to tears at mass (he he). Nor do I need anyone esle to tell me what to think. But then, I really don't need the approval of complete strangers anyway. I disagree with the church on contraception, gay rights, womens rights and miriad of other issues. To say or act otherwise to appease others would be great big fat ugly lie on my part. I pray, I read the Bible and trust in God and my own imperfect heart. \n \n Historically correct? Is there another way to be correct on this subject? If historically the Catholic Church is the Church Jesus founded then why would one want to stay away? Was he more likely to establish an enduring Church or one that would be destroyed?\n \n If you knew the symbolism, true meanings, and scriptural allusions in the Catholic mass then it would not appear boring at all. It is the union of heaven and earth.\n \n Yes, I know you disagree on the stance of contraception and women's rights by the Church. You have previously accused it of worshipping a female God in Mary and at the same time oppressing and demeaning women. This stance by detractors of the Church I always find odd. Especially since we continually raise women to the status of sainthood. \n \n \nI do not believe that he was specifying any one church. If we are to know his followers by action, you need to know individuals, not institutions. How can I possibly make that determination about something as huge as the Catholic church? What is the Catholic church - child abusing priests or Mother Theresa? \n \n And I have seen all kinds of people shout about Christ with grand enthusiasm who were not Catholic, and I have known Catholics who barely know who the Apostle Paul was.\n\n What is the Catholic Church? Both saints and sinners. \n \n Does Mother Teresa or the pedophiles point more to the truth of the Catholic Church? Who gave a better example of Jesus? Mother Teresa of course--she followed Church teaching. The pedophiles contradicted and disobeyed it. \n \n Your statements on Catholics and others are true. Many Catholics are negligent in their faith. Other churches are not void of truth. They contain truth. But only one church contains the fullness of truth of the Revelation of Jesus.\n \n \nOK - now you give the church too much credit. Plenty of Jews were preserving scripture before you guys came along. And many churches, people, historians have studied and translated scripture since then. This is a pretty insulting thing to say to a whole lot of people.\n\n The Bible you read was compiled in its present form (less 7 books of the Old Testament) by the Catholic Church. Christianity would be an entirely different religion if the Church had not done this. There was much confusion and heresy during the early times but there was also one clear, distinct voice of the Church keeping the ship on course.\n \n \nPlus - face it - they threw some scriptures together in a book format. Convenient - but it's not like they wrote it.\n\n Yes, they did write it--the New Testament that is.\n \n \nI do. I get excited about it. I get excited when ideas between faiths match, when faith matches history and science. The more that happens, the closer to truth I feel. I just finished the Bible, by the way. Cover to cover. NEXT!\n\n Great accomplishment. I hope you stay motivated in your studies. Continue to trust in God.\n \n \nIndeed, but you may not like all the reasons I find. (as in I think people ALWAYS have an agenda...)\n\n I am willing to risk it. I trust in the Church.\n \n \nI insist on continuing to think like a Leslie (my name).\n\n But the key to Christianity is not to think like Leslie. It's to think like Jesus. And the best way to think like Jesus is to think with the Church he established to carry out his mission.\n \n \"He must increase, but I must decrease.\" John 3:30\n \n \"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me.\" Galatians 2:20",

I am aware you got your start in the missionary work the Jesus gave his apostles - but you don't own the doorway to God or the interpretation of God unto yourselves. Christ was not an elitist.\n\n The Church owns nothing of Christ except what he gave it to own. I am simply conveying Christ's teaching. He established a Church on earth to carry out his mission. That Church was the Catholic Church...that can trace its descent from the apostles...the Church that maintains unity of doctrine and worship (one flock as Jesus said, one mind as Paul said)...that Church that has been constant and consistent throughout the ages from Christ to the present...that church that has been repeatedly pronounced dead and that has repeatedly risen again...that Church that is as everlasting as its bridegroom, Jesus.\n \n Scripture wasn't left to an elitist group, you're right, it was left to a hand picked crowd by Jesus. They in turn appointed and ordained others with proper authority--these people took the message to the ends of the earth. The Word is for everyone and the Church is for everyone--they have only to accept it and be obedient to it.\n \n The Church owns interpretation of Scripture because Christ gave it ownership. As scripture says, \"through the church   the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places.\" (Ephesians 3:10) The Church is the \"pillar and bulwark of truth\" (1 Timothy 3:15). \n \n You have read the Bible. How many times did Jesus ask a follower, disciple or apostle for their own interpretation of the truth or of his teaching? How many times did he ask those wishing to follow him as \"new converts\" how they would like to interpret his teachings or in what ways they would like to follow him? Did he conclusively define his teachings or did he allow debate? \n \n What do you think Jesus meant in Matthew 18:17?\n \n \nBALOGNA! I know you like to downplay things like the Inquisition, the sale of Indulgences, the policy of silence during the holocaust, the support of whore houses in the middle ages, covering up child abuse - BUT THEY HAPPENED - and they were most certainly mistakes. If you do not think so, well - my morals and your's are more different than I thought.\n\n There have definitely been sins in the church but never an error in Church teaching as it pertains to the Revelation of Christ concerning faith and morals.

As Chesterton wrote in The Everlasting Man  \"The Church is justified, not because her children do not sin, but because they do.\"\n \n \nThey were written by people who either knew Christ or his disciples. They were mostly letters\n\n Yes, they were letters. Letters written by those who knew Christ or his disciples. Letters by people in the Church that Jesus established. Letters by those who adhered to the teachings of Christ (as they actually knew Christ). Letters by those who adhered therefore to the teachings of the Catholic Church--as historically we know that there was only one Church until the 1500s (avoiding the Schism of 1050).\n \n \nI think they learned in any way they could. Talking, reading, listening, arguing, thinking and praying.\n\n Reading? I wonder if many were literate. Let's assume they were to avoid that part of the argument. Reading what? There were many writings floating around. Who told them what to read? What was a truly Christian writing or a counterfeit or an erroneous teaching that strayed from the message of Christ? How could they put their hands on something to read being that the printing press was not invented until around the 1500s and copies of writings were scarce and expensive? I wonder if they ever went to Church or even to authorities in the Church to hear the word of God.\n \n \nI do not acknowledge the pope as an authority in my life. \n \n You don't but you should. \n \n \nThe Bible can't be removed from personal interpretation. Even the pope is a person. \n \n The pope is not allowed to interpret the Bible according to his personal agenda or opinion. He has to follow the foundation of 2000 years of scripture, tradition, and previous teachings of the Church. That one of the main reasons for a pope--to maintain unity of teaching and doctrine in line with the historical teachings of Christianity and in line with the Revelation of Christ.

   "Jito,\n \nNo human has been perfect since creation. If perfection were attainable to us, Christ would not have been needed.\n\n Mary was perfect but by Christ's salvation. She needed him as we did. He simply saved her early on.\n \n \nNo, Jesus was God's son. I believe he is inferior to his father. \n \n Look up Arianism (and the Jehovah's Witness beliefs). I argue that what you believe is wrong as you argue that what I believe is wrong. Perhaps more troublesome is you calling what you believe Christianity. It has never been called that throughout history and the current prevailing thought is that what you believe is not Christianity. Call yourself Arian but not Christian. You do not believe in Christianity but a heresy thereof. Your title for yourself is not accurate. It creates confusion. As I said, read the Nicene Creed and you will know what a Christian by name is. That creed was formulated as a direct response to the beliefs you espouse--called Arianism at that time. You have the right to believe what you believe. But know what you believe and call it by that name.\n \n The Nicene Creed\n We believe in one God,\n the Father, the Almighty,\n creator of heaven and earth,\n of all that is seen and unseen.\n \n We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,\n the only Son of God,\n eternally begotten of the Father,\n God from God, Light from Light,\n true God from true God,\n begotten, not made,\n one in Being with the Father.\n Through him all things were made.\n For us men and for our salvation\n he came down from heaven:\n by the power of the Holy Spirit\n he was born of the Virgin Mary,\n and was made man.\n For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;\n Suffered, died and was buried.\n On the third day he rose again\n in fulfillment of the Scriptures;\n he ascended into heaven\n and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,\n and his kingdom will have no end.\n \n We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\n who proceeds from the Father and the Son.\n With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.\n He has spoken through the Prophets.\n We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.\n We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.\n We look for the resurrection of the dead,\n and the life of the world to come. Amen.\n \n \nWell according to the Bible \"the dead are concious of nothing\". Eternal life comes later, and I think it will be here on earth. I don't think the dead go to heaven.\n\n Perhaps you could elaborate. Why did Jesus tell the one hanging next to him that he would be in Paradise with him that very day?\n \n \nSave it for your wife. I want respect as your intellectual equal. I do not require coddling or protection. I need men to not hurt me and I need to be given credit. I am capable, smart and tough. I can take care of myself and make my own decisions. Not only are all these things possible - they are what I prefer. Nor am I interested in glass slippers. I prefer my sneakers - so I can RUN.\n\n You have my respect as my intellectual equal. You deserve credit. You are capable, smart, and tough I am sure. Woman have to be tough while often at the same time nurturing. What do you mean that you need men not to hurt you?\n \n \nYes - I think he spoke evenly and tried to get people to think. He wanted people to find it themselves. His teaching techniques indicate it. He told stories and talked with people. Most churches talk at you.\n\n But what is it that he wanted us to find? THere was something he wanted us to find--truth. It is not invented, it is found, it is in his Revelation to the world. His Church guides us to the truth.\n \n \nYou ripped that out of context and you know it. If you don't - read the rest of the Chapter. It does not warrant response here.\n\n No. What did he mean by \"church?\"\n \n \nMy point is that they are as capable of sin as anyone. I will not follow them when I think they are wrong just because they are leaders in a church. I am accountable to me and God, if things don't square there - you don't get my buy in.\n\n Most of the time when leaders in the Church are wrong it is because they are going against the constant teaching of the Church.\n \n \nAll of that is HUMAN and therefore FALLIBLE. \n \n It is protected by the authority of Jesus and by the guidance of the Holy Spirit.\n \n \nBy the way - I am not a protestant either. I belong to no church currently. Looking looking....\n\n I remember. You have told me that previously.\n \n \nBy the way - the Bible actually challenges YOU, the reader, to put it to the test. To study it on your own. To find the truth yourself. Are you aware of that?\n\n The reader should put it to the test and he should study it himself. But he should not do it in an isolated vacuum. The Bible does not attest to this. Christianity does not. It tells us to hold to the traditions passed on by those in authority. One can study the Bible and even formulate ideas, teachings from that. But if those independent ideas and teachings contradict the Church's teachings then they are wrong and must be abandoned.\n \n \nBut a whole lot of people lived prior to Christ, died without knowing his word or the word of God. What do you suppose is the answer? I think I have an idea. I think we are all to be judged at the same time - and they will get the information and the right to choose God's way or not then.\n\n I think the Church had to be the conveyor of Christ's teachings to a multitude of people who could not read or who could not obtain a Bible due to unavailability (no printing press, expense, etc.). When people say that scripture is for everyone the Church took it to its fullest meaning by conveying Jesus to those who could not read, understand, or obtain.\n \n \nNo. You can not take me out of the equation. I stand here with my own heart and mind. And as imperfect as they are - they are the ones the good lord gave to me and I will not allow them to collect dust. I think your church is wrong. I will not submit to it.\n\n I have never taken you out of the equation. You have the free will to assent or decline. But one should think with Jesus and with his Church. That is Christianity--free will guided by truth.",

   "Jito,\n \nJohn 19 and Mark 14 have him accused of blasphemy because he claimed to be the Son of God/The Chirst/The Son of Man. John 10 they accuse him of saying he was God - but Christ himself says that he is the Son of God. He also calls them gods.\n\n In John 10  it is clear that they pick up stones because Jesus was making himself God. John 10:36  tells us that Jesus saying he was the Son of God was the way of making himself equal with God (this coincides with John 19  and Mark 14). He does call them gods but it is basically the usual clever way that Jesus frustrates the scribes and Pharisees and shows them that he is the superior theologian with superior intelligence and understanding--it is a way that he thwarts their attempts to condemn him at the wrong time. \n \n John also clearly states in the very opening of his Gospel that Jesus was God and existing from the beginning of time. Furthermore, Jesus irrefutably claims to be God when he calls himself \"I AM,\" the name of God (John 8:58-59). The name which Jews would not even say out loud.\n \n Jesus claimed to be God. Either he was telling the truth, he was lying, or he was insane/delusional--lord, liar, or lunatic as C.S. Lewis puts it. If Jesus did in fact claim to be God, and was in fact crucified for this claim, and he was lying or delusional in this claim, then there is no reason to follow his other teachings. We can't trust following him simply as a moral teacher or something lesser than God if he was lying or delusional about Godhood. It is clear by his wisdom and presence that he was lucid. If he is truly lord, God, then it is rightful to follow his teachings. \n \n \nNo. I think they came to understand he was the messiah.\n\n Yes, but how did they come to view the messiah?\n \n Matthew 16:15-17  \"'But who do you say that I am?' Simon Peter replied, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.' And Jesus answered, 'Blessed are you, Simon BarJona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.\" Peter recognized Jesus as \"the Son of the living God.\" The same title that Jesus claimed that was putting him at risk of being stoned for making himself equal to God.\n \n John states in the opening of his gospel that Jesus was God.\n \n Thomas states in John 20:28  that Jesus is \"my lord and my God.\"\n \n Paul states in Colossians 2:9 that the \"fullness of the deity dwelled bodily\" in Jesus. In Titus 2:13  he says that Jesus is the great God and Savior.\n \n \nI don't think he claimed to be the same being as the father. He said he was one with him, his son, his represantative, etc. I don't believe he felt he was God himself.\n \n I believe in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. I simply believe them seperate.\n \n I am reading through the gospels this morning and it's everywhere.\n \n Jesus constantly refers to his father or the father in heaven - not himself.

In Matthew 24:36 he admits to not knowing something that only the father knows. He asks God to remove the burden of his upcoming death (if possible) - he calls to him at his death. The Trinity plain and simple makes no sense! Jews don't believe it. If God were triune - we that not have been made clear in earlier scriptures? \n \n Jesus speaks of God as Father and himself as son, as the Spirit as a person because they are all distinct persons in one God...the greatest mystery of Christianity. But a Christian mystery is not something we know nothing about, it is something that we cannot know everything about. It is something that was revealed to us by Jesus but not fully spelled out.\n \n Genesis has a verse with God referring to himself as \"us\" and \"our.\" But why was it not fully spelled out in Old Testament scripture? That's part of the reason Jesus was sent to \"fulfill the law.\" He was sent to illuminate foreshadowings of the Old Testament. He came to teach us the true and full understanding of God.\n \n \nIf you ever EVER EVER tell me what my faith is again and I will cease from talking to you. I can not be clearer. This is one of the most offensive things one can do to me. I study the Bible and pray most sincerely. I love my God, something that did not come easy for me, and struggle each to keep faith, even in what I don't understand. I believe in the salvation of Christ.

End of story. You, your church, your pope, nobody else can block that - no matter how much noise you make.\n\n I have no fear of you ceasing to talk to me. You love me too much. After all, if you can tell me I am an ally to rapists then I should be able to tell you what you believe right?\n \n I appreciate your perseverance and discovery of faith and salvation in Jesus. I am only trying to assist you in knowing truly what Christianity is. Not of my own accord, but via the testament of history and the Church Jesus created. Now John 3:16 and Mark 9:38-39  tell us that you can be saved. Is the Church unneccesary? Yes and No. God bound the Church and his sacraments but he cannot be bound by them. The Church and sacraments are not absolutely necessary because God is all-powerful and can and will save whom he wishes. But the Church is normatively  necessary in the sense that Jesus established it as the most appropriate  means to salvation. He directed us to be sanctified via the Church and her teachings and sacraments.\n \n If I offend you by telling you what you believe then you offend me with your claim to being Christian. You are attempting to mold Christianity to your beliefs instead of molding yourself to the truths of Christianity. You are attempting to distort my faith by claiming a name that has been held by billions for 2,000 years. None of these billions for 2,000 years claim what you claim. Those who did claim what you claimed did not retain the name of Christian. Many have shed blood to uphold the truth of Christianity. It cannot be redefined.\n \n \nI actually know the Nicene Creed by heart. \n \n What good does knowing the Creed by heart do? You know it but do you profess it? Do you believe it? It doesn't seem so.\n \n \nThat is a good question that I have given much thought to. Maybe he was to be. I don't believe everyone is. Maybe it's a comma thing - \"I tell you the truth today, you will be with me in paradise.\"\n\n And how did he speak to Moses and Elijah at the Transfiguration? (Matthew 17--perhaps another indication of Jesus' Godhood as well--what was a transfiguration where Jesus face shone like the sun??)\n \n \nBut everyone flouncing off to heaven does not explain many things.\n 1 - What about those before Christ? \n 2 - What about those who never had the opportunity to learn about him before they died?\n 3 - What about the meek inheriting the earth? And the Revelation 21 speaks of a new earth?\n 4 - The old testament and Jews don't believe the dead are aware. They believed in a ressurrection that was to come after the messiah. That is why I think that is why people will be given a choice later. \n \n 1--Jesus spoke the good news to those spirits in prison 1 Peter 3:18-20, 4:6\n 2--God wills all men to be saved--2 Peter 3:9. The Catholic Church teaches that those who have not heard the Gospel can be saved (remember God bound the Church but he cannot be bound by it). But those non-Christians who live good lives are saved because the good they do is really Christian though it is not called by that name and they are ignorant of it--thus there is no way to the Father but through Jesus and his gift of salvation.\n 3--will have to research this one\n 4--Is this from scripture? \n \n \nThere are undoubtedly many holes and much I do not know. But I prefer that to the conceit that there is certainty in our knowledge. I would be silly to think I couldn't be wrong. That is why I won't follow your church. YOU won't even acknowledge it could ever be wrong. That is not a place I will go. But I will take what you believe into my heart and head. It is part of my learning.\n\n Matthew 25:31-46  states that those crying \"Lord, Lord\" will not gain admittance if they did not do what was necessary on earth. The sheep to one hand and the goats to the other. \n \n There is much I do not know either. The Christian's life is a life-long conversion and learning experience. I am not conceited but I am certain. Jesus gave us that certainty to have the truth in his Church.\n \n \nI mentioned something along the lines of not needing protection or to be treated like glass. Most of the harm women face is at the hands of men (and usually loved ones at that) - it's not protection that would fix that but men not hurting women.\n\n You may be right about men hurting women. You denounce men hurting women and men who destroy relationships--that should be denounced. But the real problem is that you denounce the fairy tale along with the destroyer of the fairy tale. You denounce the Prince Charmings and Princesses with the villains. You fail to acknowledge that the institution of marriage and the traditional family is the proper and most appropriate structure for relationships of love and child rearing. Your marriage failed and your mother and father's marriage failed. That does not mean that marriage and traditional families are not the best/right way. To say that does nothing to condemn those in marriages and families that are broken. It just states that there is something better and most of those from broken families know that their situation is not the best way. \n \n \nBy the way - I think men should be tough and nurting at the same time, too.\n\n Agreed.\n \n \nHis word can guide you. Study can guide you. A community of believers that you trust can guide you. Blind adherance to some super organization can guide you to whatever it likes I suppose. But I highly reccomend using your own head.\n\n But the key is that it is not blind adherence. Catholics eyes are wide open. They assent and they humble themselves. Catholics are some of the most rational believers there are--sometimes too rational--faith and reason.\n \n \nI want to do some research on what the original language word is here - but the entire scripture was about dealing with a trouble maker in your congregation - so I would guess the congregation and it's leadership.\n\n It may be ekklesia meaning \"those called out,\" \"convocation,\" or \"assembly.\" I'm not positive though. Jesus came into the world in a visible, physical way. He was not simply the ethereal Spirit of God. It is logical therefore that he would leave a visible, worldly entity to continue his work on earth until he comes again. Catholics call these sacraments--although Jesus and the Church are not sacraments in the same sense as the seven sacraments.\n \n \nIf I choose to enter a group and adhere to it - then I would be accountable. Thing is I don't choose to adhere to the Catholic church so we don't have to worry about each other.\n\n Of course we do. Jesus told the apostles in The Great Commission to preach the Good News and make disciples of all nations. It is a Christian duty to defend the faith and to evangelize. Jesus also wanted a unified Body. We must seek unity. Therefore, we must worry about each other. \n \n \nNo - it's because they are men with all the weaknesses of the rest of us. They can be selfish, greedy and manipulative. If you see that - use your head and GET OUT. \n \n I agree with you that it is because they are men with all the weakness of the rest of us--greed, selfishness, power lust, deceit, worldly ambition, manipulation, etc. This does not contradict my previous statement that most of the time when leaders in the Church are wrong it is because they are going against the constant teaching of the Church. The Church teaches that those weaknesses are wrong and must be strived against, repented of, controlled. \n \n \nAdherance to authority can not be demanded. For the church to have any authority for me I have to allow it. I don't.\n\n I have never said that the authority the Church can be demanded--in the sense of coercion. God made us with free will. Jesus had authority but there were those who did not do what he required and they went away. The Church's authority rests in the fact that it possesses the truth, just as Jesus' authority did. Any authority we have is given to us from above (John 19:11). And all of that authority was given to Jesus (Matthew 28:18). Jesus then placed his authority in the church. So, if we are attempting to be Christians then we must adhere to that authority.\n \n \nThen there is absolutely no point to it! Why test it at all if in the end you simply ignore what you learn and just go along with what some other guy says?\n\n It depends on if what you learn conforms to or contradicts the constant 2000 year history of Jesus' church. That's not a waste of time--to learn the truth.\n \n \nYes - but I would not compare the culture of Christian Europe to cultures that use oral tradition. Jews and early Christians had a strong oral tradition. Many were nomadic - all information had to be transmitted that way - and it was feely given. Look at the way Jesus taught! - stories. In early Christian Europe it was different. That was written tradition and information was filtered and denied. How about services in Latin - a language many could not understand? Yikes!\n\n So you agree that the Church was the conveyor of the Good News in early Christianity and a large part of European history?\n \n \nBeing denied the right to disagree is not free will. BOTH Catholics and Witneses frown upon and punish a single critical thought or different idea. There is a reason I am yet worshipping alone. My arguments with you strengthen my position on that.\n\n It depends on what one is disagreeing about.\n \n In Christianity we hold certain truths-non-negotiable truths revealed to us by Jesus. To disagree or deny those truths would be like attempting to deny that 2+2=4.\n \n But you will not see more disagreement in any Church like in that of the Catholic Church. You have the Jesuits who have an educational/scientific slant, the Dominicans who stress missionary work, the Franciscans who stress living the life of Jesus and doing charity. You have the Paulists, the Augustinians, the Thomists, etc. You have the lay who are as diverse in their ethnic backgrounds, nationalities, customs, politics, economic views, educational views, professional expertise, and worldview as any other segment of the population. All of this diversity and disagreement is a sidebar to the unity of the Creed and doctrine of the Church.",

   "Jito,\n \n Is there any doubt in your mind that Jesus was actually crucified?\n \n Why was he crucified (historically not theologically)? Why were the Jews moved to seek crucifixion in your opinion?\n \n This is all I have time for now. More later.\n \n (Thanks Epaphras for your contribution. Lend us any more insight that you have. I believe I have shared those verses with Jito during a previous debate on this subject in a different thread. She didn't accept them.)\n\n \n In my opinion, the Jews didn't do that. The synopitic gospels were making nicey nicey to the romans to try to get out of being persecuted. The sahndrerin were not allowed to excute, and were never allowed to use cruxifiction. The entire trial as described in the bible ignore Jewish law, Jewish tradition, and Roman law. \n \n However, someone claiming to be 'King of the Jews' would have been considered treason and sedition by the Romans. They would have view someone claiming to be 'King of the Jews' as a focal point for a revolt against them. That provides a good political reason for the Romans to kill anybody.",

   "Maximus, \n \n I have had it. \n \n I have no problem with debate - even with those whose views are 180 from mine. But you insult me, you insult my family, you insult my intelligence. I absolutely will not tolerate you telling me what I believe, telling me my faith and my family is not as good as your's because I don't agree with you. I will not take another word from you. You are politely superior, mysogynistic and condescending. You go on ignore today - the first poster on any board I have done that to.\n\n I must again politely ask how, \"telling you what your faith is,\" as you put it, is worse than being called an ally to rapists. I have never attempted to insult anyone on these threads. I have only attempted to \"speak the truth in love.\" But the truth I will speak. Furthermore, I never said your family was not as good as mine. \n \n But the key thing is the idea that I am telling you your  faith. Perhaps the key distinction is that I do not see my faith as mine only. For I am only an appendage of the Body of Christ. My  faith is the faith of billions of others as well. It is not mine to define or to mold or to change. It is something within me that depends upon what was revealed outside of me. It was a free gift that truly belongs to Jesus. I am only a servant, a steward of that gift.\n \n Also, I am not in the business of judging the salvation of others.\n \n I am disappointed. You have taken the easy way out.\n \n (I will attempt to elaborate my points on a homosexual mentor on the \"compromise\" abortion thread tomorrow).",

   "Jito, \n A thought just occurred to me. Remember when you said this several pages back on this thread?\n \nHey whatever. What do I care if a bunch dudes want to cut love and sex out their life based on the rulings of way dead guys? I don't get it - but all the power to them \n \n Yet you have stated several times on different threads that you are celibate if my memory doesn't fail. How are we to understand you cutting love and sex out of your life? Why would you ever do something like that? Could it be that you are abstaining to achieve a greater good? How is it that you can profess celibacy but you denounce it in the Church? Another contradiction in your objections to the Church to go along with the many others.",

   "What I note is maximus asking your reasoning and offering his own. Then I note your response includes hyper emotionality. Words like \"stupid stereotype\" are overreactive given what was said. You become defensive. Maximus did not attack but merely questioned. This is a debate forum. What did you expect? Abject agreement from everyone? The fact is that Homosexuality does teach that male and female roles are meaningless. Maximus was speaking of roles. I see nothing whatever derogatory in his post as you represented it here.\n\n \n Then I say you buy into the stupid stereotype, too.

   "...but he insulted me by claiming that my faith was not Christian (he has no right - nobody has any right to tell another what they believe)\n\n Jito... it still doesn't seem like you get this --< Maximus did not insult you. YOU felt insulted by what Maximus said. There is a big difference. It is completely up to YOU whether or not you feel insulted.\n \n Second point --< Nobody did tell you what you believe. In fact, nobody CAN tell you what you believe except yourself. However, based on what you, yourself, profess to believe, other people can choose to label your beliefs one way or another. Labeling your beliefs has no impact on your beliefs themselves. It is only a label. \n \n Why does it matter to you if somebody labels your beliefs one way or another? Why do you allow that to offend you? So you don't believe that Jesus was God. So what? That's your prerogative. So what if Arianism is an accurate label for one who does not believe that Jesus is of the same substance of God? A Christian, according to Webster, is one who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ. Arguably, the two definitions are not mutually exclusive. If one is into using labels, both labels could be used to describe your beliefs. (Personally, I'm not much into labels, though sometimes they can be handy for communicating thoughts and ideas.) \n \n In reality, you are who you are. You believe what you believe. Calling you one thing or another cannot change that. Be comfortable and confident with yourself and your beliefs.\n \n Peace,\n The Bootfitter",

   "I didn't bash anyone's religion.\n\n \n \n\n I think you know that I think the Catholic church is filled with a whole lot of self-important hooey - although have no fear - I feel this way about most religions, but ESPECIALLY those to claim to be the sole proprieters of truth and to be the only doorway to God.\n\n \n and also speaking about the Catholic Church:\n \n\n Historically you are correct, doesn't mean I have to bore myself to tears at mass (he he). Nor do I need anyone esle to tell me what to think. But then, I really don't need the approval of complete strangers anyway.

   "To Whom It May Concern:\n As most of us around this thread are Christians and most of what we are currently discussing is Christianity, then I will use an old and profound saying of scripture to begin my final defense, \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.\" Now this applies in a certain sense to the controversy now present being that Jito claims harm while at the same time professing innocence. I also claim harm while at the same time professing innocence. I initially and continually put this forth by asking why telling someone the historical definition of the Christian is worse than being called an \"ally to rapists.\" There is a silence. But now I will add to this original question. I will continue to maintain and prove my innocence while I will show Jito's failure to maintain innocence and inability to claim harm (although it may be perceived but not actual, emotional but not objective). \n \n There are several possible explanations for others' views of this controversy: 1. It is possible that my own mind and perception fails me and I have suffered no harm from Jito and I have administered much harm to her. 2.You all have short memories of the exchanges between Jito and me. or 3. You all have a lack of exposure to the numerous debates between Jito and me. Thus you are doing as Greg so congenially warns us not to do (mostly to those defending me). He warns against making rash judgments on a few sensational posts, not taking time to understand, throwing the Bible at others. He commends Jito for getting the guys on the right page, etc.\n \n I would like to assure Greg that I \"know\" jito perhaps as well as anyone on this debate forum could know her (from debate) being that we have been debating for a year?? 2 years?? at the least many months (jito can help with this). I assure him that I am not making any snap judgments, any judgments at all, any votes or guesses on one's salvation--this is something I constantly maintain in all of my debating though some may misconstrue. I am attempting to be objective as I always attempt to be by using history, Church teaching, Scripture, and Holy Tradition. I did what I always do when I told Jito that what she believed was not Christianity but Arianism, a heresy thereof. Note also that I was not making any claim on her ability to be saved by Jesus when I did this, as was explained in a later post.\n \n Being that I know most of you would not trust my assertion that I have not lost my mental capability or abilities to perceive, I thought it might be best to do a few searches of previous debates between Jito and me. I will let you all decide what the true reasons are for the differing opinions as to the cause, effect, and implications of the current controversy between Jito and me. Is it #1--my own short memory, losing my mind, #2 your short memories, or #3 your lack of exposure to our debates?\n \n Jito asserts that I am telling her her faith and that this is extremely offensive. She also claims that she does not bash others' faiths and that she does not tell them of what their faiths consist:\n \n \nI didn't bash anyone's religion. I never claimed to be more right or wrong than anyone - I claimed to disagree and explained why. In return MY faith was bashed - I was told I was not Christian because I don't conform to their church. That is extremely insulting. No man has the right to claim me for Christ or not. I strongly feel people can believe what they like - I am friends with Catholics, Lutherans, Pentacostals, Hindus, Muslims, Pagans, Jehovah's Witnesses, Agnostics and my own father is an atheist. Every single church/religion I have encountered has in some way laid claim to knowing the \"truth\" - and Christians are the worst.

Every time I go near a church they get out the ball gags of judgement sticks. I don't mind at all that Maximus and I disagree. I know his faith is real. He was the one who couldn't take the disagreement and put down my faith - not that other way around.\n\n \n This is clearly false. I appreciate the defense of JPSartre but it only skims the surface (thanks to Bootfitter and Epaphras as well). Jito uses inflammatory language like calling those in the Church misogynistic, describing the Mother of God as a \"dead broad,\" calling celibate priests those \"bunch of dudes who want to cut love and sex out of their life based on way dead guys,\" labeling the pope as someone who wants women either pregnant or dead, and saying she actually hates him, etc., etc. She condemns me for telling her that her faith is not Christian when in the past she has told me that many Catholic beliefs are not Christian! She takes this point so far that she tells us that we worship Mary, believe in an institutional church more than in Jesus, have a \"sick\" view of sexuality, teach the faithful to continue pumping out babies into poverty, and questions the pope's motives for naming a woman who gave her life for her child a saint (among other niceties that she expresses about the pope). Note also that she accuses me above of not being able to take the disagreement and putting down her faith. But it is actually she who could not take the disagreement and withdrew (leaving many of my assertions from the same post of the alleged offense unanswered, I might add). Now, I have spoken enough, I will allow Jito to speak for herself:\n \n \nAnd there are plenty of things in Catholic dogma that have nothing to with Christianity or what's in the Bible. As a matter of fact - there are things that I am aware of that are completlely unbiblical - starting with the one thing that ticks God off the most - worshipping somebody besides Him - and Catholics do. (Mary, saints, etc.)\n\n \n \nA prayer is an act of worship. Furthermore the Bible says quite plainly that the onlly way to God is through Christ, not a group of historical people in the Bible/church. Through Christ and Christ alone.\n\n \n \nMaximus.\n \n I will make this simple.\n \n I think the Pope sticking his grubby nose into strangers sex lives is inapropriate - period. Kind of sick actually. And that is what the Catholic Church's view on sexuality comes down to.\n\n \n \nI believe birth control is a wonderful thing that will result in far less abortions and unwanted, unloved kids that all the Pope's pomp and circumstance.\n\n \n \nSo, you agree with the Pope that the only good woman is pregnant or dead? (I actually thought I could not despise that man more....)\n\n \n \nBy making a saint of that woman who chose to die for her pregnancy. SHE was brave. He is not. So many women have done so many brave and amazing things... \n \n That and the fact that he opposes birth control. Women need to be pregnant, mothers or dead in his eyes.\n\n \n \nThe message he sends is FOUL. I hate the Pope!\n\n \n \nYou and the Pope can bite me.\n\n \n \nHis ideas about the reproductive functions of people in general tick me off. His influnce in Latin America is especially disturbing. He tells these people - no birth control, no control for women, no abortion - just keep pumping out those babies - - - and these people are in extreme poverty. I know this. My ex-husband is from there. I saw it with my own eyes.\n\n \n (Most of these quotes are from \"Where is the line?\" thread in the abortion forum. The accusation of being an ally to rapists can be found in \"The Compromise\" thread in the abortion forum.\n \n Now, what have I done to respond to this harm? Have I ended the debate? Have I cried foul? I have done what I most often do. I have asked the offending person to show me proof. Most of the time it is not produced in supporting the above types of accusations. Furthermore, I give evidence from the sources mentioned above (scripture, history, etc.) to counter or squash the accusations. Only once that I can remember have I ever even claimed to be offended and that was at the recent rapist accusation. I like strong debate. I have no problem with it objectively or even when it gets a little inflammatory. It is like the challenge of a rougher than usual basketball game. Let's keep banging around. (So when I say I have suffered harm in the first paragraph I am just using that term, I don't really mean it.)\n \n I agree with many of Greg's compliments to Jito. She knows (or should know) this because, as hard as I am on her, I have complimented her perserverance, her motivation, her cooperation with God in her path to Jesus. I have offered my sorrow for her problems in life. I have patiently withstood her accusations. I have enjoyed debating her. But I have never compromised my faith or what I believe to be the truth to do that. I will not. There are many claims to truth. One must decide which he feels is the most historically, scripturally, Traditionally sound--one must decide whose claim to truth is the claim to truth. Once he does that, he should cling to it with all his might. He should defend it with all his might. Why believe in it otherwise? I have always done this strongly, sometimes sharply, often in a coy or humorous manner, but never maliciously.\n \n Forgive my wordiness, but do not forgive my words if you have cause. Judge me as you will. \n \n I end this post as I have ended most of them since I have started debating here, to always make certain my intentions are known.\n \n Peace.",

   "Yes , I agree to disagree . She does have a fire, but who on here IS totally passive ? My point is she was put in a defensive position and is fighting back. I have never met a man or woman that when one questions their beliefs in a jabbing fashion, that did not get defensive . When a person starts pointing out flaws in a person's beliefs, and starts using the word YOU, it changes the whole debating arena to a personal battle. Then ,throw in a mix of personal family issues , it is bound to get to a boiling point . Hopefully everyone one might re- group and chill a bit, and come back civil . I enjoy Jito's and Max's viewpoints both, they have a lot to contribute here for people like me . :)\n\n I applaud Max's ability to be calm as Jito makes wild assed comments about his and my religion. I don't share in his passivism, though. I've been known to go for the jugular when provoked. Instead of turning the other cheek, I \"go midevil\".",
