   "http://www.lfospot.com/themiddle.htm\n \n excerpt\n \n \"Why do we pay so many taxes? Simple really. Those good folks we've placed in power in Washington are sort of like that businessman on an expense account from his company buying everyone a drink at the bar. He's not all bad; he's just flush with the idea of spending someone else's money. Think about it. You're never as careful when you're spending funds that didn't originate in your own wallet. Let our boys in Washington pay for some of their pet projects out of pocket and our national budget would be balanced in a heartbeat. \n \n We in the Middle say that it's time for us to control where our money goes. We're generous, caring and thoughtful people. Why must we be treated like children who don't know any better? \n \n Few of us begrudge old Uncle Sam his pound of flesh for the services he provides each and every one of us. He protects our borders and international interests with brave soles who probably don't get paid enough. He provides a highway system that can take us to any doorstep in any town. He provides more brave individuals who come and help when we make that phone call scared and at our wits end in the middle of the night. He helps to improve the quality of our lives immeasurably. Unfortunately, in his quest to do good things, he sure wastes a whole lot of money. \"\n \n This is a cool article...could it really be this simple?",

   "This is a cool article...could it really be this simple?\n \n no it is not. for example\n \nAlso, unlike today's strange \"Moving Target budget\", funds available to the government would be static rather than floating. Our politicians would be held accountable when they screw up and run out of money. If a program's funding is $182,798 then that is the budget with which they would operate. No longer would programs spend more money than they were allotted and make up the difference later. Our government would operate more like a business and less like that businessman we talked about earlier who spends more than he's supposed to and then just finds random receipts laying on the floor to make up the overage he's created when he reports to his boss. \n \n sounds good, but how do you budget for the defence? if htere is an attack, or just a desine flaw found in a ship it will cose more than would be expected.\n how would FEMA's budget be set? or should the victomes just be told dont worry the red cross will be along, and call your inshurance compney.\n \n \nSo, here's the plan: first, we'll earmark 70% of the new tax rate as the Core Funds we discussed earlier. \n \n who decides what is core?",
