   "http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/breaking/092905credit.php\n \n \nAs gasoline prices soar, more people are charging purchases to credit cards, even as many are having difficulty paying off card debt\n \n It's becoming increasingly common to use plastic at the pump: 70 percent of gas purchases were paid for with a credit or debit card in the first six months of 2005, compared with 54 percent last year, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores.\n \n \n snip\n \n Consumers use cards to buy gas because they're \"trying to displace the pain until their next statement,\" says Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the store group. \"They don't want to spend the cash they have.\" \n \n \n \n Who are these retarded monkeys? Displace the pain of the high gas prices by paying the high gas prices, plus tacking interest on top of them? \n \n I love the little self pay deal at the pump as much as anybody. That is where you put your DEBIT card. Paying for consumables with a credit card is just a bad idea (unless of course you plan to pay the balance off at the end of the month, thus escaping the interest). \n \n Anybody care to guess how long the Amrican public can stay afloat and maintain their artificially high standard of living? If the article is any indiator, I would say not long if we are looking at people having to charge their gas, and increased levels of late payments on cards. The impact of the high energy costs has not really even hit us yet. food prices are on the rise, especially fresh produce. Within 6 months plastics and other petroleum based products will likely increase in price by 20-30%. Add to that the fact that we are going into winter, with no solid plan for replacing the heating oil lost due to refinery failures, and it will be an expensive year for a lot of folks, many of whom cannot even absorb JUST the gas price increases.",

   "Considering that in the last 6 months heating oil prices have gone up 50% and that natural gas prices have gone up 100% and it's not even freakin' winter yet, I think it's safe to say that credit card delinquency in the US will go through the roof next winter.\n \n Frankly, I never understood why Americans use their creditcards to buy their daily consumables. Here in Holland 99.9% of the people use their debit cards for such things.",

Why? The points, detailed quarterly/annual listings of expenditures by category and cash flow. \n \n 1. The points - so many we can't personally use them, but vacations, flights, dining out certificates and merchandise make fine gifts to family and friends, costing us zero.\n 2. Tax records - A simple running spreadsheet keeps all details at hand for charitable contributions, business and investment expenses with the IRS considering AE's summaries as acceptable documentation. Forget keeping all those dumb, often unreadable receipts.\n 3. Cash flow - Our operating cash stays in an interest bearing account until the AE monthly statement is paid. I'll take as many points of interest as I can get.\n \n Why doesn't the general public like AE? It has to be paid every month and doesn't allow cash advances/charges carried forward at loan shark interest rates that will financially cripple them. \n \n I've noticed many retailers already have the Xmas junk in their stores, maybe trying to get some sales before winter heating season costs maxes out credit cards and drains bank accounts? Now that US credit card companies have successfully lobbied changes in BK laws to make discharge of consumer debt almost impossible, they can carry delinquent balances on the balance sheet as assets almost indefinitely and attach creditor estates upon death.
