But if some creationist says \"But in that other thread you said evolution meant, blah, blah, blah...\" don't come crying to me. :)\n \n Ok, getting off my soapbox now, I'd say you're totally right. Certain branches of Christianity, like Catholisism, have traditionally been very resistant to change. Unwilling to adapt, one might say. And the Catholic church has been in a state of decline of late. The social climate in which Catholosism thrived no longer exists, and so it isn't doing as well. We also see lots of little churches springing up, filling religious enviromental niches, as it were. \n \n What can we predict for the future? Here's my guess. The two main enviromental factors that will shape religion will be a desire for stability and an ability to adapt to new ideas. As communication and travel become easier, people will be exposed to more new ideas and cultures, and religions will be forced to deal with people saying \"Yeah, but what about this new idea I just heard? How does that fit in?\" On the other hand, as people get exposed to other ideas, they'll want to have some core of ideas of their own to hold on to. Sort of a psychological anchor. \n \n I figure we should expect to see the more dogmatic churches fade away, as people become exposed to more, different ideas. If you can't adapt, you become extinct. Churches that espouse firm moral ideas based on humanisitic reasoning will probably do well.",

   "Greetings to Apathy and All:\n \n Apathy << At first the Christian church was small. Then, a little later, it grew and as it grew and spread, it changed a little. Then, a little later, it unified and was called the Catholic church. \n \n Terral's reply << You are assuming that those from the Catholic 'religion' are indeed Christian's. Please allow me to present some Biblical facts. There are two gospel messages presented for the 'forgiveness of sins' (Acts 2:38, Eph. 1:7) in our New Testament, but only one has power today. See my post here: \n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2509\n \n The Roman Catholic Church has adopted the wrong good news message into their works based religion. Instead of preaching Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16, 16:25 about Christ crucified 1Cor. 15:1-4), they have taken precepts from the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12) and created a different gospel (#3) from my original post. \n \n Paul states that there is 'one Lord, one faith, one baptism.' Eph. 4:5. He describes that one baptism as being performed by the 'One Spirit.' \"For by one Spirit [Eph. 4:4] we were all baptized [Gal. 3:27] into one body [Rom. 12:4+5, 1Cor. 12:27], whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.\" 1Cor. 12:13. Paul describes the details of the process to the Ephesians:\n \n \"In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were SEALED IN HIM with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of {God's own} possession, to the praise of His glory.\" Eph. 1:13:14. And, \"In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace.\" Eph. 1:7.\n \n So, when we believe the gospel, the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Christ's body, and our sins are forgiven through His shed blood. However, the Roman Catholic Church teaches water baptism for the forgiveness of sins, as their Sacrament Number One, which is part of the 'gospel of the kingdom' that Israel rejected. So they are adding this work of human hands to Paul's gospel of 'Christ crucified.' Therefore, they have believed a false gospel, and have accepted a lie for the truth. So instead of being part of the 'mystery of Christ,' they are part of the 'mystery of lawlessness' (2Thes. 2:7-12 (7)) and have been baptized into the body of the antichrist, along with all the other denominations who have believed Satan's counterfeit gospel. So do not be fooled by appearances.\n \n Apathy << Then later, there was a split, The Great Schism, and the Protestant church was born, and it allowed some different sects and orders and eventually denominations to emerge. Today, we see a very diverse and widespread variety of Christian churches that vary with geography. Does this mean that the Christian religion is evolving?\n \n Terral's reply << Judaism is a true works based religion where the priesthood stands as intercessor between God and men. True Christianity is not a religion at all. It is a relationship, where we have confident access (Eph. 2:18, 3:12) between the believer (sons of God; Rom. 8:14) and the Creator through His Son (Rom. 8:34), by the power of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:26+27). The road to destruction is like a twelve lane highway, and the way to life is a path. Christ says, \"Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.\" Matt. 7:13+14.\n \n Apathy asks << Does this mean that it is still in the process of evolving? And, that I should expect to see something different in the far future than what I see today?\n \n Terral's reply << The body of the antichrist is like a lumbering giant with billions of members from well over 2000 denominations who have believed different versions of the same false gospel. Yet even among those deluded denominations there exists a remnant of true believers who were \"appointed to eternal life.\" Acts 13:48. Since both of these groups are growing in numbers and changing with their environments, I believe they are both in the process of evolution.\n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

   "Then, the apologetics got into \"Genesis Kinds\" and all that poo. Was it before or after Origin of Species?\n\n After. Christian fundamentalism is somewhat recent. It arose as a backlash to discoveries being made in science in the 19th century. From one follower of a 7th Day Adventist prophetess came \"flood geology\" in the early 20th century. Later, in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the U.S. in the 1960s, there arose more modern \"creation science.\" It began by adopting the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventists as the base.\n \n Creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories, the flood story, even the mythology of Job and Jonah, are literally true. Creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the Bible.
