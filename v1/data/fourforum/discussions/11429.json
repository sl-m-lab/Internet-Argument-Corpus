   "Well, let's see, I was talking about the Patriot Act, so here's a short list\"\n\n \n Oh, this is special. All one must do is read between the lines of this propaganda piece to see exactly how distorted it is. For examples, I will just bold the parts rather than write them out. \n What Rights Have You Lost Under Bush?\n I always hear the line, \"What rights have you lost under Bush?\". It's a favorite on Liveleak. The most obvious one, the right to privacy, most definitely has been violated. Unarguably. I haven't personally lost this right (as far as I know), but some US citizens unquestionably have.\n \n [ARCHANGEL] So here he say's the most obvious right that we've LOST under Bush is the right to privacy that has been \"VIOLATED\", NOT LOST AT ALL. There's a big difference between violating a right and losing it. But this guy sets the whole premise of his point up as a lost right, and then admits that in some cases, they might have been violated. But not for him of course, but for some US citizens unquestionably. But then he doesn't tell us who they are, what class of people, are they criminals, minorities, terrorists? He doesn't tell us anything other than to make a vague unsupported claim.\n \n SPYING ON THE HOMEFRONT\n \n Although the president told the nation that his NSA eavesdropping program was limited to known Al Qaeda agents or supporters abroad making calls into the U.S., comments of other administration officials and intelligence veterans indicate that the NSA cast its net far more widely. AT&T technician Mark Klein inadvertently discovered that the whole flow of Internet traffic in several AT&T operations centers was being regularly diverted to the NSA, a charge indirectly substantiated by John Yoo, the Justice Department lawyer who wrote the official legal memos legitimizing the president's warrantless wiretapping program. Yoo told FRONTLINE: \"The government needs to have access to international communications so that it can try to find communications that are coming into the country where Al Qaeda's trying to send messages to cell members in the country. In order to do that, it does have to have access to communication networks.\"\n \n The bolded say's it all here. And if these loony lefties understood that islam has written fatwas in blood promising our submission to allah or our complete destruction, they might understand that this is a matter of National survival.\n \n Spying on the Home Front also looks at a massive FBI data sweep in December 2003. On a tip that Al Qaeda \"might have an interest in Las Vegas\" around New Year's 2004, the FBI demanded records from all hotels, airlines, rental car agencies, casinos and other businesses on every person who visited Las Vegas in the run-up to the holiday. Stephen Sprouse and Kristin Douglas of Kansas City, Mo., object to being caught in the FBI dragnet in Las Vegas just because they happened to get married there at the wrong moment.\n \n A check of all 250,000 Las Vegas visitors against terrorist watch lists turned up no known terrorist suspects or associates of suspects. The FBI told FRONTLINE that the records had been kept for more than two years, but have now all been destroyed.\n \n Gee, this paragraph say's nothing about any negative fallout for any Americans at all regarding this New Years Eve investigation. Where's the loss of anyones rights? It's legal to vacation, gamble and even hire prostitutes in Vegas, so where is the harm? \n \n OTHER ARGUABLY LOST RIGHTS:\n \n *FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION: Government may monitor religious and political institutions without suspecting criminal activity to assist terror investigations.\n \n *FREEDOM OF INFORMATION: Government has closed once-public immigration hearings, has secretly detained hundreds of people without charges, and has encouraged bureaucrats to resist public records questions.\n \n *FREEDOM OF SPEECH: Government may prosecute librarians or keepers of any other records if they tell anyone that the government subpoenaed information related to a terror investigation.\n \n *RIGHT TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION: Government may monitor federal prison jailhouse conversations between attorneys and clients, and deny lawyers to Americans accused of crimes.\n \n *FREEDOM FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES: Government may search and seize Americans' papers and effects without probable cause to assist terror investigation.\n \n *RIGHT TO A SPEEDY AND PUBLIC TRIAL: Government may jail Americans indefinitely without a trial.\n \n *RIGHT TO LIBERTY: Americans may be jailed without being charged or being able to confront witnesses against them.\n \n This part in red is especially perverse in its deceptive nature. And it starts in the title; Other Arguably Lost Rights! ARGUABLY??? There is no arguably lost rights, they either are lost or they aren't. And note the bolded in each of the examples with no supporting examples of it happening to any American actually happening. \n \n AS AN ARAB AMERICAN, NONE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS NOR MYSELF HAVE EVER SUFFERED ANY OF THESE INCONVENIENCES.

Oh well.\n\n \n Thats why we give the burglar a warning, or at least everyone I know does. \n \n \n \nWhat multitude of points in Archie's post did I miss?\n\n \n Actually, you missed his entire point, as usual.\n \n \nAnd the number of words I used was longer than 2 or 3, and they were penned by one of your founding fathers, who you keep appealing to.\n\n \n Your trying to defend one liner arguments?\n \n \nMulticolored, bolded, capitalized large fonts make you look like an XXX. That said, it appears I was mistaken.\n\n \n I don't really care, you know.\n \n \nAnd you just showed that once again, I was right in saying you have no idea what an \"If-then\" statement is. You said - If these stats are right, then why aren't people banning cigarettes and alcohol.\n\n \n And I was not implying that we should ban tobacco and alcohol. I was implying that gun owners don't really want to save lives because they're focusing on the beam rather than the moat. If you claim otherwise, you're essentially saying \"I don't want to ban this stuff because it's better.\"\n \n \nIOW, take it as a given the stats are correct and tell me why cigarettes and alcohol don't get the level of response guns do. Which I did. The fact you are completely incapable of understanding something this simple says absolutely nothing about me.\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nSee above. I'm not explaining this again. The fact that you claim to have somehow won something when you weren't even aware of what was under discussion is just pathetic.\n\n \n You continually misunderstood my points (as ususal), you addressed the entire OP with a one liner (as usual), you claimed to have debunked stuff and then lied about it (as expected), and now you dare tell me that I'm misunderstanding?",

   "In other countries? Absolutely none, self-defense, let alone armed self-defense, doesn't exist outside of the United States.\n \n \n \n That's just more proof that more guns doesn't equal more crime or more killings.\n\n I think there are significant differences between gun ownership in Switzerland and gun ownership in the US. Switzerland's gun ownership rate (46 guns per 100 people) is about half that of the United States according to the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey. Switzerland also has somewhat strict gun laws. Each time you buy a gun from a Swiss gun dealer you have to get a permit and that permit can only be used to buy one gun. So it's not like in the US where a gun trafficker can buy guns in bulk from a dealer and then distribute them on the black market. Many of Switzerland's guns are assault rifles that members of the Swiss Army store at home. These weapons are less likely to be used in crime since criminals tend to prefer weapons that are easy to conceal and carry. Soldiers in the Swiss Army are required to store their guns under lock and key and to store the ammunition separately which makes it less likely that these guns will be used in a crime of passion. By the time someone had retrieved their weapon and loaded it they could have cooled down. It also makes it less likely that such weapons will be stolen.",

   "I challenge you to show a recent example where an armed populace has successfully used force to overthrow a tyrannical government. I then challenge you to show how this would work against one of the most well-armed government in the world - that of the USA.\n\n \n -Vietnam War: (they never succumbed, and we weren't able to spread our \"democracy\" so 1 for the little guy.\n \n -Mogadishu, Somalia: Black Hawk Down ring a bell? Also if your argument for this is going to be \"that was a small rescue operation, it was never a full fledge military action against a country etc.\" That would be correct, although they (US) were out numbered, it was a band of Special Ops soldiers (meaning the best, of the best) that were mauled, and gunned down by rebels/kids with AK47's. \n \n -Warsaw Ghetto uprising: During WW2 small groups of people banded together in Warsaw, Poland and stood up against Nazi troops that were coming to lay further siege to that area. Although not recent, certainly not ancient either. Anyways they fought, and resisted capture!\n \n -Current day Iraq: We don't have control, as much as our media says we do, and things aren't getting any better. Seems that the insurgency is working...\n \n Chechnyan war: Sure the Russians were the aggressors, and have more bodies under their belts but wait, the dissent in Chechnya is still there? What about the Russian's, didn't they quell that little uprising? Seems to me that the disorganized rebels are actually organized, and that when people really want to take action they do!\n \n Romanian revolution: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution\n It's all there!\n \n Would you like some more. I am very well versed in military history so whenever you want some, I got some! ;)",

   "Sorry, I realise I'm changing the terms slightly, but you've misunderstood my initial request, mainly due to my own wording. \n \n It should have read 'I challenge you to show a recent example where an armed populace has successfully used force to overthrow it's own tyrannical government.' This is because this is what we were talking about - not overthrowing others (like Vietnam, Iraq, Somalia) but overthrowing your own government, who have slowly eroded your 'rights' as they go and have the political machine enabled to persuade the general public that they are doing the right thing (see: the patriot act, gitmo, and so on).\n \n I did manage to include 'successful' in the original, however - getting rid of Warsaw and Chechnia.\n \n The one remainder is Romania, which I agree meets all the standards of the first half of my challenge. Thanks, it was an interesting read. However, Romania was an unsteady country. America is far from unsteady, and is a world leader - probably likely to get support from it's many allies, unless it does something hugely dire, in which case the ex-allies will fight the war on behalf of the US public, like the US has tried to do in Iraq. I would guess mixed success would happen there, too.\n \n Also, Romainia is one example. Most rebellions end in failure - armed or not. See every other war where a major power has defeated a minor one.",
