   "I've seen one pink elephant in my life. I may just have to go to Louisiana to see this pink dolphin in person.\n \n Pink dolphin appears in US lake - Telegraph\n \n \n Pink dolphin appears in US lake\n \n The world's only pink Bottlenose dolphin which was discovered in an inland lake in Louisiana, USA, has become such an attraction that conservationists have warned tourists to leave it alone.\n \n Charter boat captain Erik Rue, 42, photographed the animal, which is actually an albino, when he began studying it after the mammal first surfaced in Lake Calcasieu, an inland saltwater estuary, north of the Gulf of Mexico in southwestern USA.\n \n Capt Rue originally saw the dolphin, which also has reddish eyes, swimming with a pod of four other dolphins, with one appearing to be its mother which never left its side.",
