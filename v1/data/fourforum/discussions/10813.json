Lesz is correct in identifying the fact that various other strains of MRSA have infected others and no stink was made of it.\n \n Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people carry some form of S. aureus; of these, up to 53 million (2.7% of carriers) are thought to carry MRSA. In the United States, 95 million carry S. aureus in their noses; of these, 2.5 million (2.6% of carriers) carry MRSA.\n \n In the United States, there have been increasing numbers of reports of outbreaks of MRSA colonization and infection through skin contact in locker rooms and gymnasiums, even among healthy populations.

Feel free to point it out if you can.\n\n \n Well, I think it is good to be careful. There has been a lot of misuse of the HIV epidemic against gays, from a PR standpoint. These sort of medical issues aren't endemic to being gay, so I can understand suspicion over something like this. At the same time though, I also think it's somewhat unreasonable to have a mentality that discussing bugs-among-gay-men is unacceptable and off-limits here, or that only gays can do so. The article clearly said that gay men were 13 times more likely to get the bug. Now it could be that the author of the article was WRONG, and if that's the case, then he needs to get his facts and stats straight. (ahem!) But I'd think people here would welcome the chance to disprove it if it is indeed incorrect. Again, I don't think being gay makes one any more likely to get this infection, and it certainly was not my intention to infer such. Nevertheless, it's not exactly fair to have an atmosphere here where even the very discussion of infection/disease-related topics equates to an inference of causality when it comes to being gay, or equates to hate. Topics like this should be able to be freely discussed. But at the same time, within that discussion, I think people need to be open and sensitive to the views of gay people and their perspective on issues like this. It doesn't need to be something to beat people over the head with. That's my 2 cents, anyway.",

This study's purpose was to estimate trends in the incidence of and risk factors for clinically significant MRSA (CS-MRSA) infection in a cohort of HIV-infected adults.\n \n Design: A retrospective clinic-based cohort (January 1, 2000-December 31, 2003) study.\n \n Methods: We ascertained all initial episodes of CS-MRSA and categorized them by primary site. Incidence rates were estimated by half year. Risk factors for CA-MRSA infection were identified using Cox modeling.\n \n Results: Of 126 potential events, 94 were CS. Their primary sources were 83% skin or soft tissue, 10% blood, 6% respiratory, and 1.0% other sites. Among these, 60% were CA and 40% were nosocomial. Of antibiotics tested, only cotrimoxazole resistance was associated with nosocomial acquisition. The 3455 patients contributed 7003 person-years at risk. The incidence of CS-MRSA infection increased 6.2-fold from the first to the last half year. In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of CA-MRSA infection included HIV transmission by men who have sex with men or by injection drug use, CD4 count <50 cells/[mu]L, log10 HIV plasma viral load, and absence of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.\n \n Conclusions: The incidence of initial CS-MRSA events increased more than 6-fold in a 4-year period. The associations between CA-MRSA infection and HIV severity indicators merit examination in other cohorts.\n \n \n\n \n This has been common among those with risk factors for HIV. The \"community acquired\" variant of MRSA does seem to present with unusual and virulent skin infections.\n \n It is very common for news agencies to print such items months or years after the medical community has been aware and call it news. I very much support raising community awareness, but it should be more timely to be helpful and it always seems a tad sensational. For example, I want to cringe every time I hear \"flesh-eating bacteria\".",

Maybe a bit less sensationalism and homophobia would save more lives.\n\n \n You are right. Some homophobes hoped HIV could be used as a weapon against Gays. Instead they used it as a weapon against themselves because while in the early days of the disease it was primarily a gay problem, the gay community refused to accept that and deal with it and leaders in that community were absolutly livid at the idea that gays should be primarily targeted with efforts to control the spread of the disease. As a result thousands of gay men died needlessly. \n \n I havean uncle who is gay. He is also a doctor. When aids was really emerging as a serious problem in the gay community, the CDC sent him to SF. His job was pretty simple...lias with the gay community and leaders of the community to try to develop a strategy of education, outreach, and prevention. Instead his car was detroyed and he lived under constant threat of bodily harm. Despte the fact that he actually really liked SF, he was forced to leave the city because a bunch of militant gay activists were so upset with what he was trying to do that he felt his life was in danger. \n \n Aids continued to spread like wildfire through the gay community for a LONG TIME after the CDC recognized the disease vetors and started efforts to control it because for whatever reason, there seem to be plenty of radicals out there who saw the effort to keep them from dying a horrible death as discrimanitory. \n \n Now we have a NEW strain of MRSA. This is NOT old news. It is more virulent and resistant to a wider range of antibiotics than other strains that are out there. IT IS NEW, IT IS DEADLY, AND IT IS SPREADING IN THE GAY COMMUNITY. Currently teh disease vector is pretty much LIMITED TO the gay community. Regardless of the BS in the link that you posted above, this is a NEW STRAIN that is MORE DANGEROUS and a gay guy in california is at one hell of a lot higher risk of getting it that I am (straight in Kansas). \n \n You can deal with that accept it, take steps to protect yourself, and move on, or you can take comfort in the kind of ######## being spewed by Petrelis and his ilk. It was scumbags like him that prevented effective moves to contain aids in the first place, which resulted in the needless death of a horrifying number of gay men.",

Maybe a bit more 'sensationalism' would have saved some more lives.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes \n Similarly, Reagan and a variety of other people didn't want to \"discuss it in the press\" either.\n Moreover, in today's society you have people like GW Bush who refuse people to allow frank discussion on sexual protection, including gay, which would prevent the spread of AIDS.\n \n Today, you would be hard pressed to find gay people who don't want AIDS \"discussed in the press\".\n If you have examples, that would be helpful.\n \n The key to discussing it is to discuss it FACTUALLY and HONESTLY.\n Don't make up inaccurate names like \"GRID\".\n Don't suppress information like how condoms are effective in combatting the spread of the disease.\n \n But for the flip side of the coin, today suppression of the facts is virtually mandated in governmental policy.\n And I find it interesting that in the MANDATED CONTINUING suppression of real discussions by GOVERNMENTAL sources, you don't even comment on it...",

   "Archie, my dear, ALL MRSA strains are difficult to treat with antibiotics, and new ones will continue to pop up. This is expected by evolutionary theory. The fact that this latest strain happened to appear in a couple of gay communities is irrelevant to anything and anyone, except homophobes. If it had appeared in some old folks home, your buddy jyosh and you would not be bothered one whit. It's because it's them evil homosexuals that are spreading it you get your knickers in a twist.\n \n And BTW, ALL MRSA strains are spread by sexual contact, as well as causal contact. This one is no exception. It just pleases you guys to demonise gays every opportunity you get.\n\n I thought this post should be repeated.\n \n Along with...\n \n \n \nA correspondent to the conservative Andrew Sullivan blog puts the MRSA story in perspective:\n \n MRSA: The Small Print\n \n From the original scientific article:\"Our incidence estimates for San Francisco come from a passive surveillance system and may underestimate the incidence of true infection. We relied on retrospective chart review for identification of risk factors for multidrug-resistant USA300 infection in the 2 clinic populations; because data were not collected or documented systematically, our estimates of risk may be influenced by selection, referral, documentation, or other biases. Specific sexual behaviors were not assessed or documented in clinic charts; we therefore cannot comment on the association between multidrug-resistant USA300 infection and specific male-male sexual practices.\" \n \n The correspondent comments:MRSA has been around a long time, and as a practicing Navy physician I have seen outbreaks in millitary populations for years. A 2005 study by the Navy Environmental Health Center that did not make any headlines showed that community acquired MRSA was present in 3-5 % of Navy recruits. There have been significant outbreaks in the SEAL training school in San Diego, as well as the Marine Recruit Training Depot, but this has not made the news. MRSA has also been a problem for years in hospitals and nursing homes. Now that someone has found a community outbreak in a gay population, it's \"big\" news ... bullsh!t. \n \n And that basically sums the (non)story up. New variants of some disease always pop up somewhere specific, and spread from there. But it's only a \"story\" if those scary homosexuals happen to be the community in question. Sheeesh. I guess you would emphasise this if you wanted to do a bit of scaremongering to the effect that being gay is bad for you.\n\n \n \n In skimming the threads, these facts seem to go completely unaddressed.\n Instead, posters \"respond\" about how much they don't like being accused of being anti-gay...\n \n Which is interesting because the EVIDENCE of that often goes uncontested...",

   "You are right. Some homophobes hoped HIV could be used as a weapon against Gays. Instead they used it as a weapon against themselves because while in the early days of the disease it was primarily a gay problem, the gay community refused to accept that and deal with it and leaders in that community were absolutly livid at the idea that gays should be primarily targeted with efforts to control the spread of the disease. As a result thousands of gay men died needlessly. \n \n I havean uncle who is gay. He is also a doctor. When aids was really emerging as a serious problem in the gay community, the CDC sent him to SF. His job was pretty simple...lias with the gay community and leaders of the community to try to develop a strategy of education, outreach, and prevention. Instead his car was detroyed and he lived under constant threat of bodily harm. Despte the fact that he actually really liked SF, he was forced to leave the city because a bunch of militant gay activists were so upset with what he was trying to do that he felt his life was in danger. \n \n Aids continued to spread like wildfire through the gay community for a LONG TIME after the CDC recognized the disease vetors and started efforts to control it because for whatever reason, there seem to be plenty of radicals out there who saw the effort to keep them from dying a horrible death as discrimanitory. \n \n Now we have a NEW strain of MRSA. This is NOT old news. It is more virulent and resistant to a wider range of antibiotics than other strains that are out there. IT IS NEW, IT IS DEADLY, AND IT IS SPREADING IN THE GAY COMMUNITY. Currently teh disease vector is pretty much LIMITED TO the gay community. Regardless of the BS in the link that you posted above, this is a NEW STRAIN that is MORE DANGEROUS and a gay guy in california is at one hell of a lot higher risk of getting it that I am (straight in Kansas). \n \n You can deal with that accept it, take steps to protect yourself, and move on, or you can take comfort in the kind of ######## being spewed by Petrelis and his ilk. It was scumbags like him that prevented effective moves to contain aids in the first place, which resulted in the needless death of a horrifying number of gay men.\n\n \n This is just another typical anti-gay screed aimed at blaming gays for getting sick. The gay community responded to the HIV crisis far earlier than the government, which had to be lobbied for years before it would take it seriously. \n \n As for the supposed greater risk for gay men, this is merely a matter of degree of exposure, not behaviour. Anyone in the epicenter of a new strain is going to be at greater risk of contracting it than those elsewhere. But this story has legs because the community is gay, and homophobes will batten on anything to make gays look bad.",

   "A New 'Gay Disease'?\n \n \nThe headlines this week about a new \"gay\" infection were dramatic. FLESH-EATING BUG SPREADS AMONG GAYS, said one Australian newspaper, referring to a study about an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection affecting homosexual men in San Francisco and other American cities. EPIDEMIC FEARED--GAYS MAY SPREAD DEADLY STAPH INFECTION TO GENERAL POPULATION, shouted a press release from the Concerned Women for America, a conservative public-policy group. \n \n But is there a new HIV-like public health epidemic on the horizon? Not likely, says Dr. Henry (Chip) Chambers, coauthor of the study, which was published this week in the online edition of the Annals of Internal Medicine. \"This is definitely not the new AIDS,\" says Chambers, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). \"HIV is a life-threatening disease that is incurable and necessitates lifelong treatment,\" adds Bill Stackhouse, director of the Institute for Gay Men's Health at the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York. \n \n \n This is just the usual gay-baiting from hysterical right-wing Christians. Strains of MRSA have long been spreading outside hospitals: schools, daycare centers, the military, gyms, and virtually anywhere people gather in close proximity, have become focal points for new outbreaks.\n \n But hysteria abounds when *gasp* gays are associated with such an outbreak.\n \n \nIn the UCSF study, researchers found that men in a clinic for HIV-positive patients who had a history of having sex with men were 13 times more likely than other HIV-positive patients to get a particular form of community-associated staph infection called MRSA USA300. But this does not mean that there is a new \"gay\" form of MRSA, the study's authors say. USA300 has been around since 2002 and has appeared in at least 38 American states among heterosexual and homosexual patients. What is new is the rapid rate the bacteria spread among this particular population of gay men, studied between 2004-2006. Why these men are more vulnerable than the heterosexuals studied is still a question.\n\n \n Well, it's been reported in a clinic that treats HIV+ clients. If that weren't enough, there are plenty of other factors that should be considered besides the fact that many patients are gay.\n \n \nGay men's health advocates point out that MRSA can be spread through any kind of skin-to-skin contact, either sexual or nonsexual, without regard for sexual orientation. And they have been very critical of the media for its focus on the sexual aspects of the story. \"It's very unfortunate,\" says GMHC's Stackhouse. \"It's very stigmatizing, it's alarmist, it's homophobic and it's just unnecessary.\"\n\n \n It's no surprise that a Christianist hate group like Concerned \"Women\" for America choose to emphasize the sexual orientation of patients. It's part of their agenda. As for the media, they should know better, but then, they do love a sensation.",

This effort was fairly though not completely successful, and today in the US, most new infections occur outside the male gay community.\n\n \n With all due respect lesz, these two paragraphs contradict each other. I say that because the whole problem with the bath houses was that group random, unprotected sex was the normal activity within them. And to say there was never any evidence of that is denying the facts also because when the medical authorities backtracked the sexual habits of the AIDS Patients they had in their hospitals, they tracked directly back to the Bath houses in whichever City these victims lived in.\n \n If that wasn't the reality then the authorities never would have focused on Bath houses at all because they were seriously looking for the diseases transference hotspots, and not to make excuses or to brush this under the rug. Here is a link that shows that even today there is a higher percentage of sexually transmitted diseases within the gay community than in any other community and that it is attributed tracked back directly to gay SEX clubs and BATH houses. So this is still an issue lesz.\n \n http://gaycitynews.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19176542&BRD=2729&PAG=461&dept_id=568864&rfi=6\n \n \nThe government lagged behind in funding prevention programs, because at first it assumed that HIV was targeting gay men, and they were never a priority in US society.\n \n \n This just isn't fair at all. At the time you're referring to the disease didn't even have a name. I remember when it was called the \"Thin Man Disease\" because of the gaunt look of the victims in the throes of the diseases effects. The actual discovery of, and definition of AIDS was made and announced on March 30, 1986 and It was Reagan who created the Presidential Commission to study the issue. So like all Government responses, it was impossible to act upon or react to a disease which we didn't even know how to treat at the time. Once that was determined, effective action could be, and was taken. \n \n http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3D9103FF933A05750C0A960948260&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=print\n \n \nAs for MRSA, it isn't specifically a sexually transmitted disease -- it's a highly infectious group of organisms that is transmitted in a variety of casual ways, including passive transmission through air and surfaces. It's perfectly fine to point out the obvious, that poor hygiene and sexual promiscuity are going to increase risks of infection, but there is no reason to suppose it is any specifically homosexual behaviour that is responsible for the outbreak. It makes no sense to blame gay men for this.\n\n \n You are both right and wrong lesz. You are right in how MRSA is transmitted through out the general Population at large under normal circumstances. But the gay version of it that is more difficult to treat is transmitted through sexual contact, even if it is only kissing on the lips when one person is infected.\n \n I mean, as a gay person, are you telling me that you are concerned about catching this if you just shake the hand of another gay man? I think not. Now if someone who had it coughed directly in your face, that would scare me for you, but that type of germ transference is almost on the same level as intimate contact because it is so direct an exposure.",

   "This is just another typical anti-gay screed aimed at blaming gays for getting sick. The gay community responded to the HIV crisis far earlier than the government, which had to be lobbied for years before it would take it seriously. \n\n \n This is simply a LIE. And I don't know if you are the one telling it, or ifyou have just spent too much time listening to XXXXXX, but the CDC was all over aids before it was ever even named. They were working on aids before they even understood how it was spread. AIDS is the reson my uncle \"came out\" to my mother (he is her brother). HE told her \"I am gay, and there is a new disease out there that is pretty terrible and seems to target mostly gay men. I wanted you to know, and if you don't want me in your house or around your children I understand\"\n \n At that point, they had not even figured out that it was primarily sexually transmitted. For the first time since its inception, the CDC actually shut down influenza research, and cut WAY BACK on tracking, so they could devote more resources to figuring out the whole AIDs thing. That is how my uncle ended up at the CDC. They spent a LOT of money to pull him out of private practice. \n \n A lot was made of the fact that the president was not out there directly addressing aids and it has been suggested that was somehow discrimanitory. Addressing diseases and illness is not really the presidents job. That is what the CDC is for. The president typically does not talk about hanta, bubonic plague, MRSA, or any of dozens of other health challenges the nation faces. Why would AIDS have been any different? Second, once they figured out how AIDS was spread, the CDC told the president that AIDS would not be too difficult to control. They did not realize that they would run into MASSIVE opposition from the gay community when they tried to implement programs to control the disease. They did not realize at the time that many gays (foolishly) considered sex to be the cornerstone of the gay liberation movement and an attack on anonymous, unprotected sex would be percieved by the radicals as an assault on gay rights.\n \n \nAs for the supposed greater risk for gay men, this is merely a matter of degree of exposure, not behaviour. \n\n \n For the most part yes. The only potential difference is that MRSA, like most infections, spreads better in a warm, sligtly moist environment which means that on carriers you most likely are going to find the highest concentrations of the disease places like their armpits and groin with lower concentrations around the rest of their bodies. We seldom come into contact with peoples armpits or groin area, unless we are having sex with them, so there is a behavioral component here, but it is certainly not limited to gay sex. Any sex, or any activity that puts you in contact with somebodys groin or armpits is likely to be a higher risk activity regardless of who is involved or their sexual orientation. \n \n \nAnyone in the epicenter of a new strain is going to be at greater risk of contracting it than those elsewhere. But this story has legs because the community is gay, and homophobes will batten on anything to make gays look bad.\n\n \n To some degree I agree. The homophobes and religous whack jobs are going to try to make a bigger deal of this and try to use it to support their twisted idiocy. \n \n At the same time, this story should have legs anyway, and frankly should be on the front page of every gay oriented publication on the planet, because it has the potential to save lives and eliminate a LOT of unnecessary pain and suffering. MRSA, even this new strain, can be stopped dead in its tracks with soap and water. When it comes to MRSA (before it takes hold), an alcohol swab is a WMD. There is no reason whatsoever that another gay man should ever have to suffer or die from this.\n \n I guess that things like this really highlight how far the gay rights movement needs to come...it says a lot about the mentality of the gay community. Here we are with information that could save your life, or the life of somebody you love, and it appears that there are a lot of people in the gay community who instead of doing what they can to spread the information to try to save lives within that community would rather see the information suppressed. Why? Because you are afraid that some people might say mean things about you. \n \n Frankly I cannot imagine anything more pathetic than that. I know that if there was something like this vectored on straight, white, midwestern men with similar numbers, I would do everything I could to ensure it was on the front page of every newspaper in the region. If some nutjob somewhere wanted to try to use it as an example of gods wrath being brought down on straight white midwesterners, it would probably #### me off, but not to the point I would rather see people DIE than see the information spread. \n \n I am not sure whether to pity such people or loathe them. While it is sad that there are people out there who are so insecure and so self loathing that they would prefer to see their friends and loved ones suffer or die rather than risk mean words from others. That truly is sad. The fact that they would actually act on that is loathsome. If you are not secure enough in your identity to weather some criticism, no matter how unjust, that is fine. Don't sentence others to death because you have some psychological issues.",

   "A New 'Gay Disease'?\n \n This is just the usual gay-baiting from hysterical right-wing Christians. Strains of MRSA have long been spreading outside hospitals: schools, daycare centers, the military, gyms, and virtually anywhere people gather in close proximity, have become focal points for new outbreaks.\n \n But hysteria abounds when *gasp* gays are associated with such an outbreak.\n \n Well, it's been reported in a clinic that treats HIV+ clients. If that weren't enough, there are plenty of other factors that should be considered besides the fact that many patients are gay.\n \n It's no surprise that a Christianist hate group like Concerned \"Women\" for America choose to emphasize the sexual orientation of patients. It's part of their agenda. As for the media, they should know better, but then, they do love a sensation.\n\n \n From your link lesz:\n That's not to say that drug-resistant staph infections aren't a serious health problem. As these so-called superbugs become more resistant to common first-line drugs, doctors have been forced to turn to alternative antibiotics, explains Chambers. Once restricted to hospitals, these virulent forms of staph have increasingly afflicted day-care centers, schools, gyms and other public areas in the last decade. These community forms of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) typically cause boils or abscesses to develop on the skin, and in serious cases, they can produce necrotizing fasciitis, which destroys tissue (hence the \"flesh-eating\" label). Infections that aren't controlled by medication or are left untreated can also damage the heart and infect the blood.\n \n In the UCSF study, researchers found that men in a clinic for HIV-positive patients who had a history of having sex with men were 13 times more likely than other HIV-positive patients to get a particular form of community-associated staph infection called MRSA USA300. But this does not mean that there is a new \"gay\" form of MRSA, the study's authors say. USA300 has been around since 2002 and has appeared in at least 38 American states among heterosexual and homosexual patients. What is new is the rapid rate the bacteria spread among this particular population of gay men, studied between 2004-2006. Why these men are more vulnerable than the heterosexuals studied is still a question. Researchers stopped short of labeling USA300 a sexually transmitted disease, but they did note that the infections in the men they studied were commonly found on parts of the body where skin-to-skin contact occurs during sexual activity.\n \n Gay men's health advocates point out that MRSA can be spread through any kind of skin-to-skin contact, either sexual or nonsexual, without regard for sexual orientation. And they have been very critical of the media for its focus on the sexual aspects of the story. \"It's very unfortunate,\" says GMHC's Stackhouse. \"It's very stigmatizing, it's alarmist, it's homophobic and it's just unnecessary.\" \n My question is, why are Gay men's health advocates so quick to play down the risks that this strain of MRSA poses to their community? Isn't it better to be safe than sorry? \n \n And regarding your attack on CWA, did you notice that the article you posted was from the USA Today? And their main concerns in their article coincides perfectly and accurately of the flesh eating characteristics that Dr. Chambers reveals above. These symptoms are very real so why do you label them a christianist hate group for reporting exactly what an objective doctor you respect is saying too? It seems inflammatory and slanderous just because they are a non gay organization. Here is the link to CWA's piece: Notice it quotes Reuters and the Dr who made the study.\n \n http://www.cwfa.org/articles/14530/MEDIA/nation/index.htm\n Epidemic Feared - \"Gays\" May Spread Deadly Staph Infection to General Population 1/15/2008\n \n Washington, D.C. - Reuters has reported that, \"A drug-resistant strain of potentially deadly bacteria has moved beyond the borders of U.S. hospitals and is being transmitted among gay men during sex, researchers said on Monday.\n \n \"They said methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is beginning to appear outside hospitals in San Francisco, Boston, New York and Los Angeles.\"\n \n \"'Once this reaches the general population, it will be truly unstoppable,' said Binh Diep, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco who led the study.\"\n \n According to the study, at this point, homosexual men are 13 times more likely to contract the potentially deadly, drug-resistant strain of staph infection, but the fear is that, because the infection is spread via skin-to-skin contact, homosexual men may soon spread it to the general population.\n \n For Information Contact:\n Natalie Bell\n (202) 488-7000\n media.cwfa.org\n The point is that cross community transfer is a very real concern and possibility with the bisexual aspect of the sexual equation in America. It can't just be dismissed as hate speech or motivated by bigotry when objective doctors within the medical community are the experts making these predictions based on the current symptoms that they are witnessing in real time.",

   "Reagan's AIDS Legacy: Silence equals death\n \n \nFollowing discovery of the first cases in 1981, it soon became clear a national health crisis was developing. But President Reagan's response was \"halting and ineffective,\" according to his biographer Lou Cannon. Those infected initially with this mysterious disease -- all gay men -- found themselves targeted with an unprecedented level of mean-spirited hostility\n \n [...]\n \n Reagan could have chosen to end the homophobic rhetoric that flowed from so many in his administration. Dr. C. Everett Koop, Reagan's surgeon general, has said that because of \"intradepartmental politics\" he was cut out of all AIDS discussions for the first five years of the Reagan administration. The reason, he explained, was \"because transmission of AIDS was understood to be primarily in the homosexual population and in those who abused intravenous drugs.\" The president's advisers, Koop said, \"took the stand, 'They are only getting what they justly deserve.' \"\n \n How profoundly different might have been the outcome if his leadership had generated compassion rather than hostility. \"In the history of the AIDS epidemic, President Reagan's legacy is one of silence,\" Michael Cover, former associate executive director for public affairs at Whitman-Walker Clinic, the groundbreaking AIDS health-care organization in Washington. in 2003. \"It is the silence of tens of thousands who died alone and unacknowledged, stigmatized by our government under his administration.\"\n\n \n It was the stigma of homosexuality that delayed the government from releasing the resources need to deal with the crisis. For all the warnings of scientists, in the CDC and outside, little was actually done till the epidemic had spread to tens of thousands of people, and had become an international crisis.\n \n MRSA is simply not in this league.",

   "Holy hell in the morning, it is amazing how the misinformation flies.\n Let's talk about this. (I will attempt to touch on various misunderstandings that have been posted in this thread)\n \n 1. Staphycoccus aureus is a bacterium, not a virus. It primarily causes skin infections, \"boils\", if you will. It gets complicated, but a primary drug to treat Staph has traditionally been an anti-staphylococcal penicillin called methicillin (and a bunch of closely related drugs). MRSA (methicillim resistant Staph aureus) has been around for a long time, but hospital-acquired (HA) MRSA has been a particularly bad problem for 10 years or so. The community-acquired variant was very rare until the last 3-5 years. It still, like good ol' garden variety Staph, causes skin infections, the vast majority of which don't need antibiotics to treat, but like its more friendly relative are treated best with incision and drainage. Granted this newer variety can be more virulent, and cause nastier boils and like all Staph can develop into more generalized infections. CA-MRSA appears to have a different genetic sequence and antibiotic susceptibility than HA-MRSA but those distinctions are becoming blurred. \n \n 2. This CA-MRSA is not a new problem. Well, I guess that's a relative term; if you are just learning about it, it is new to you. The ID docs (that's infectious disease, not what you are thinking) have known about it for years. I heard about it at a conference 2 years ago. The ONLY reason this is hitting the news now is because of an article in this month's Annals of Internal Medicine. (This was not a ground-breaking article in the medical community). They looked at 2 cohorts of patients from 2 clinics in SF from 2004-2006 and found a striking concentration in some zip codes. Looking at the demographics of those patients in those clinics, men who have sex with men was associated with a risk ratio of 13. Remember it's that risk factor in those circumstance, so to say that one is 13 times more likely to get it with gay sex, isn't even close to being true. It is not certain that it is sexually transmitted, but that's a safe bet given those risk factors. \n \n 3. This CA-MRSA can cause some really nasty infections. It is NOT \"flesh-eating\" whatever the fork that means. It is not nice to get. But it is not a 5-alarm problem. Many infections are manageable without antibiotics even. Staph infections, in general, are not nice. These are worse, though, as they are more aggressive, and if they spread, the choice of antimicrobials is limited. It is NOT something you need to treat \"within hours\" as some alarmist said. \n \n 4. The transmission of CA-MRSA is the same as any other Staph - skin to skin. About 25% of the population harbors Staph (is colonized) in the nostrils primarily, and in the perineal area. That is where CA-MRSA is colonized as well, but the percentages are less, but that's depends where you hang out. Clusters or outbreaks of CA-MRSA infections have affected children in day care centers, native American communities in several states, athletic teams, military personnel, men who have sex with men in Los Angeles and San Francisco ( and now Boston), and prison inmates in several states. It is not primarily a gay issue. Intimate physical contact (sex) seems to do it, but is not the primary source of transmission. Interestingly, the three major reservoirs of HA-MRSA are patients, healthcare workers, and the inanimate environment (doorknobs!)\n \n 5. You can't get a Staph infection from an inadequately laundered athletic supporter. That's just stupid. You got it the way everyone does. Man to man contact!!! \n \n 6. With respect to gays harming themselves during the early years of the AIDS epidemic by opposing attempts to close bathhouses and the like, that's really complicated. Yes, there were misguided attempts to ignore public health warnings. Hell, there was this huge movement that insisted that HIV didn't cause AIDS, but that is no stupider than ID (not infectious disease.) Certainly, many gay men were very suspcious of attempts to curtail sexual activity by the establishment. Kinda understandable. Was it wrong-headed? You betcha! Whether closing the bathhouses was a good idea is debatable, as some people thought that is the ideal place to do outreach and education and closing them would only shift the locations of unsafe sex out the reach of education efforts. \n \n Are gays trying to brush this recent news under the rug. I don't think so. It is business as usual in STD prevention. There is a reaction to some commentators who characterize this as another moral issue - a problem of promiscuous gays. When discussing the issue of unwanted pregnancy, no one ever frames this as an indictment of heterosexuals or heterosexuality. The problem comes from certain behavior, not from certain people.\n \n When news of a medical problem is accompanied by this \nWake up, medical and political establishment: homosexual behavior is unhealthy -- no matter how many secular sermons you preach against \"homophobia.\" Due to liberal political correctness, which treats aberrant -- even deadly -- behaviors as a \"civil right,\" we as a society don't seem to have learned much from the AIDS pandemic; \n \n(from Peter LaBarbera of Americans for Truth about Homosexuality)\n \n ... it seems natural to infer that this is less a concern about public health issues than a desire to condemn a certain group of people.",

And frankly, I don't think closing the bath houses had much effect in the long run, maybe even the reverse, but it made people feel they were accomplishing something. \n \n The message of HIV, and of MRSA today, is not that gay sex is bad for you, or even that sex is bad for you, but that you need to be responsible and take precautions against infection.

   "Let's take another look at poor old St. Augustine -- this link will do as well as any:\n \n \nSaint Augustine (A.D. 354-430) in his work The Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim) provided excellent advice for all Christians who are faced with the task of interpreting Scripture in the light of scientific knowledge. This translation is by J. H. Taylor in Ancient Christian Writers, Newman Press, 1982, volume 41.\n Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion. [1 Timothy 1.7]\n\n Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about homosexuality. Gay people certainly do, and we know that it is ludicrous to believe that a loving god created us only to condemn to hell what he created us to be. So when Christians condemn gays to hell for being who they are, they condemn their god in the same breath. They bring their own beliefs into disrepute and shame.\n \n Some Christians, such as Desmond Tutu, realise this, and know that statements condemning gay people are, as St. Augustine said, \"utterly foolish and obviously untrue\". Others remain blind to reason, slaves to literalist bibliolatry. You, Archie, are one of these others, on this and several other issues dealing with science.",

Even \"And the Band Played On\" showed some gay people acting fairly irrationally to the pronouncement of the problem.\n \n I see some legitimacy in those points, but at another stage there WERE signs of a \"response\" that was \"altered\" because of the subject matter.\n The Surgeon General was ham-strung from announcing that the simple condom could be an effective deterrent.\n For some time, the disease was known as \"GRID\" even though the evidence at the time showed it to be an inaccurate label.\n \n I have no doubt that there were MANY good men and women who fought against HIV as they were scrambling to understand it.\n \"Closing the bath-houses\" (depending upon the year it was attempted) can be arguably an attempt at CONTAINMENT of the disease.\n But at the same time, \"another\" reality DID exist whereby there were some who used it to their advantage in a \"political / moral\" approach.",

The press then ran with this spin without asking any deeper questions or other scientists (or even the CDC, which along with the University of California issued a statement decrying the sensationalist coverage), and the story was taken advantage of by the usual suspects such as the Concerned \"Women\" of America (btw, how come most of these \"women\" are actually men? Enquiring minds want to know!).\n \n Anyway, far from being helpfully informative, much of the actual press coverage has been inflammatory and alarmist, and so has the response of the usual anti-gay rights brigade posting here. It's just the latest weapon to go bay-bashing with, and despite being thoroughly debunked, it's become another urban legend that the Christian right will never allow to die.\n \n That's the real importance of this story, that it's being deliberately painted as a new \"gay plague\" in order to demonise gays. That MRSA is a threat to every community, including gays, is conveniently forgotten about. Don't expect our friends to address that issue, though, as it's not helpful to the anti-gay agenda.",

   "I have no doubt that there were MANY good men and women who fought against HIV as they were scrambling to understand it.\n \"Closing the bath-houses\" (depending upon the year it was attempted) can be arguably an attempt at CONTAINMENT of the disease.\n But at the same time, \"another\" reality DID exist whereby there were some who used it to their advantage in a \"political / moral\" approach.\n\n \n There were gay activists who were primarily concerned, understandably enough, with the potential threat to individual liberties and the civil rights gains made to date posed by such measures. Arguably, they couldn't see the wood for the trees and had their priorities wrong, but still, one could understand their point even if one didn't agree with it.

Certainly, they were a quick and easy target, because who can argue that unprotected, promiscuous sex is not a rapid conduit for disease? Seems at first sight like a no-brainer. However, I suspect that closure actually compounded the problem by taking away an educational opportunity to target high risk individuals directly and non-judgementally, and so modify behaviour. It merely sent unsafe sex elsewhere, to private parties and clubs. It didn't stop it from happening; but it decreased the opportunities to broadcast information to the audience that needed it most.\n \n There is no doubt, however, that there are certain elements in Christianity that feels no compunction about using the health consequences of foolish behaviour to attack gay people in general, irrespective of their behaviour.

(story) \n \n The researchers examined records from outpatient clinics and found that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is showing up in large numbers among men who have sex with men in New York, San Francisco, Boston and Los Angeles. \n \n In San Francisco the bacteria was found to be 13 times more likely in gay patients than other people in the city.\n \n The researchers said the bacteria appears to be spread through sexual contact.\n \n But in a statement the CDC says that sex and sexuality appear to have nothing to do with transmission. \n \n \"It is important to note that the groups of MSM in which these isolates have been described are not representative of all MSM, so conclusions can not be drawn about the prevalence of these strains among all MSM,\" the CDC statement said. \n \n \"The groups studied in this report may share other characteristics or behaviors that facilitate spread of MRSA, such as frequent skin-to-skin contact ... There is no evidence at this time to suggest that it MRSA is a sexually-transmitted infection in the classical sense.\" \n \n The statement also provided ways of ensuring that MRSA is not passed on. \n \n These include keeping hands clean, keeping any open wounds bandaged, and not sharing utensils. \n \n The study also has been criticized by LGBT rights groups who said that the researchers were attempting to portray the disease the way HIV/AIDS was at the onset - as the \"gay cancer\". \n \n Henry Chambers, one of the study's authors and a professor of medicine at UCSF, said he regretted that the study has been made a political issue. \n \n \"We deplore negative targeting of specific populations in association with MRSA infections or other public health concerns ...[We were] \"looking at this from a scientific point of view and not projecting any political impact.\"\n",

   "Just for the record, here is the CDC's statement on the MRSA \"gay plague\" story:\n \n \nCDC Statement on MRSA in Men Who Have Sex with Men\n \n MRSA is a common cause of skin infections throughout the United States. These infections occur in men, women, adults, children, and persons of all races and sexual orientations, and are known to be transmitted by close skin-to-skin contact. In this issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, Diep et al looked at isolates of MRSA - USA300 strains containing a particular plasmid associated with additional drug resistance. The paper shows that multidrug-resistant USA300 has emerged as an important source of disease among men with have sex with men in 2 geographically distinct communities.\n \n The strains of MRSA described in the recent Annals of Internal Medicine have mostly been identified in certain groups of men who have sex with men (MSM), but have also been found in some persons who are not MSM. It is important to note that the groups of MSM in which these isolates have been described are not representative of all MSM, so conclusions can not be drawn about the prevalence of these strains among all MSM. The groups studied in this report may share other characteristics or behaviors that facilitate spread of MRSA, such as frequent skin-to-skin contact.\n \n CDC's extensive and continuing study of invasive MRSA in 9 US states indicates that these strains are rare. CDC continues to monitor resistance patterns and strain characteristics in MRSA isolates submitted to CDC for a variety of investigations. Bacteria are able to acquire resistance to antibiotics. It is concerning that these bacteria are becoming resistant to more antibiotics than the typical community associated-MRSA strains because this limits the available treatment options. Fortunately, there are still effective choices available to treat infections when antibiotics are required, including those antibiotics given by mouth. It remains important to do what we can to prevent transmission of these strains and of MRSA in general.\n \n MRSA is typically transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, which occurs during a variety of activities, including sex. There is no evidence at this time to suggest that it MRSA is a sexually-transmitted infection in the classical sense.\n \n Therefore, CDC believes that our recommended prevention measures for CA-MRSA in general are also the most appropriate response to the strains described among MSM. [good, general advice on prevention follows]\n\n \n In short, this form of MRSA is not new, it is not restricted to gay men, and it is not a new \"gay plague\" carried by irresponsible homosexual demons that once again threatens the innocent, Christian heterosexual community. It is also worth repeating that the incidence of this form of MRSA in NY and SF among sexually active gay males in STD clinics is considerably lower than it was in previous outbreaks in non-gay communities, such as military camps and sports teams.\n \n Time to get over it, but this won't stop the spreaders of lies in the fundamentalist anti-gay Christian community.",

The NYT has this:\n \n Resistant Bacteria, Football Players and Gay Men\n \n It assesses the situation a little more soberly than the original stories, though doubtlessly it will not be quoted by right-wing Christians in their onslaught on gay people.\n \n The Columbia Journal Review, an excellent little source on how the media treat facts and spin, has this story:\n \n The MRSA-Gay Connection\n \n \nThe press performed a minor mea culpa over the weekend, explaining that a new multidrug-resistant and especially virulent strain of MRSA staph infection, USA300, is not the new \"gay disease.\"\n",
