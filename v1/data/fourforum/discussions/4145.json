   "so day = day\n\n \n \"Day\" (yom in Hebrew) can mean extended ages of time. For instance....\n \n \"Evening and morning\" is an idiomatic expression in Semitic languages. Like all idioms, its meaning is nonliteral but clearly understood by native speakers. The phrase \"evening and morning\" can, like yom, denote a long and indefinite period. The Old Testament itself unambiguously uses the \"evening and morning\" phrase in just such a way. In Daniel 8 we read the account of Daniel's ram and goat vision and the interpretation given by Gabriel. The vision covers many years; some commentators believe the time has not yet been completed. Daniel 8:26 says, \"The vision of the evenings and the mornings that have been given to you is true, but seal up the vision for it concerns the distant future\" (RSV). In Hebrew manuscripts, \"the evenings and mornings,\" is not in the plural but in the singular, identical to the expression we find in Genesis 1. Translated literally, the verse would red, \"And the vision of the evening and the morning that has been given you\" Here we have a clear indication from scriptural usage that this phrase does not demand a 24-hour-day interpretation and can refer to an indefinite epoch.\n \n One might raise the objection that during the many years between the writing of Genesis and the writing of Daniel, the Hebrew usage could have changed, making the extrapolation from Daniel back to Genesis questionable. My response to such a challenge would be to underscore the stability of the ancient languages (perhaps due to the lack of general literacy and the rigorous professional training of those who served as scribes.) I see no way to escape this example of flexibility usage. http://www.leaderu.com/offices/o_helweg/eve-morn.html\n \n On the third day, God formed the land out of the seas. There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas. Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants:\n Then God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth\"; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11)\n And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12)\n The text clearly states that the earth \"sprouted\" the plants (the Hebrew word deshe, Strong's #H1877, usually refers to grasses). The Hebrew word dasha, (Strong's #H1876) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have \"sprouted.\" In addition, these plants produced seeds. The Hebrew word here is zera (Strong's #H2233), which is most often translated \"descendants.\" This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation. Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants. There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time. Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time. http://www.godandscience.org/youngearth/genesis.html",

   "Easyrider:\n \n Many Christians claim that the days of creation actually represent millions of years of earth's history. They say that God did not create the universe in six literal days but in six periods of time, representing millions of years held by the evolutionists. First of all, one has to recognize that science cannot prove the age of the earth. There are many assumptions behind all of the dating methods of which most people are not aware. There is also much scientific evidence consisten with a belief in a young earth (e.g. the fact that there is no observed 3rd Stage Super Nova Remenants (SNRs) in our galaxy). But the Bible itself teaches quite clearly that the days in Genesis are ordinary, literal days (approximately 24 hours, Earth Standard Time (EST)). \n \n The Hewbrew word of day, yom, can mean an ordinary day or an indefinite period of time. It should be made clear that the word for day in Genesis can never mean a long period in the definite sense. It can mean something longer than a day, but only in the indefinite sense (e.g. in the time of the Judges, in the day of the LORD). Exodus 20:11 tells us that God created the universe in six days and rested on one as a pattern for man. This is the reason God took as long as six days to make everything. He set the seven day week pattern for us, which we still use today. God did not say He worked for 6 million years and rested for 1 million years, telling us to do the same! It makes even less sense to suggest He worked for six indefinite periods of time.\n \n There are many other aspects at which we could look to show that the days must be ordinary days. For example, Adam was created on day six. He lived through day six, and day seven, and died when He was 930 years old. If each day were a million years, there are big problems here, too. It also needs to be made clear that the passage in 2 Pter 3:8, that compare a day to a thousand years is not defining the word 'day' as a thousand years. In fact, taken in context, 2 Peter 3:8 has nothing to do with the days of creation, but with the fact that God is outside time.\n \n The word 'day', when first used in Genesis, cannot be symbolic. A word cannot be used symbolically teh first time it is used. It can only be used symbolically when it first has a defined literal meaning. It is given this defined literal meaning in Genesis chapter 1, the first time it is used. Also the words used for the 'evening' and 'morning' can only mean exactly that.\n \n In Genesis 1:14-19, concerning the fourth day of creation, the word 'day' is used five times in relation to days, nights, seasons, and years. If the word 'day' here doesn't mean an ordinary day, it makes absolute nonsense of the way it is used in these passages.\n \n Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants.\n \n You are forgetting that God would have made the plants as 'adult plants', just like He made Adam and Eve as adults, mature. We also don't really know how many kinds of plants God created in the beginning. But they were created so that they could reproduce, just like the birds two days later. There is no problem here for those who read Genesis at face value, as it was meant to be taken. \n \n Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit.\n \n No, God created them mature supernaturally from the ground. Genesis 2:9 reinforces this idea that God created them supernaturally with trees that were fully grown and ones that had fruit:\n \n 9 And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground-trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food.\n \n You're thinking in naturalistic terms. The creation is a totally God 'putting on His working shoes' and getting right in there and making it Himself. The fact that the trees and plants were made on the third day also justifies the fact that the plants did not take years to form from the ground (see discussion above for reason why the word 'day' in Genesis cannot be symbolic). \n \n There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time.\n \n And there is no human that is capable of coming from dust either... \n \n God created all things mature and fully formed so that they could obey His order to reproduce and fill the earth (not such a hard task, eh?). If Adam didn't sin, it wouldn't be that long before we could come to God and say, \"We've filled the earth, just as you said, now what?\" Sigh, sin recked that though...\n \n The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means.  \n \n Where in the Scripture does it say that God allowed such a thing to happen naturally? That is your interpretation. The text clearly states that the plants came from the ground; and since God is making everything supernaturally, the plants were made from the ground when God gave the command, just like God's command for light to come.",

   "Sorry for I mispoke that the previous generations have been misinformed...I meant that they had simply misinterpreted more than just being misinformed....I'm not claiming to know the exact time Jesus will return, for that would be foolish and contradictory to what the Bible says....but I believe God has and will continue to provide signs that the end is ever drawing closer....\n \n 500 years from now is a very exagerated number...even when you take it from a complete scientific view, there is bound to be to many factors that would mean the end of the world i.e. Global Warming, Nuclear War/Nuclear Winter, the Sun dying out, asteroid hitting the earth, natural resource depletion, and so on.....regardless of your take on Christianity mankind is creating way to many problems and not enough solutions.....scientist will agree with that....\n \n As for what I would write, well I would hopefully write the same thing, because hopefully he was writing out of what God had laid on his heart and not some urgent little letter trying to help maintain a steady and growing church...\n \n I think you may be looking at that scripture wrong....the \"we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together ...\" that is simply a statement that could concern not only that time, but more for the current church of when Christ returns....you are looking at it as if Paul was implying it was for that current time period.....I believe Paul was simpy giving the church and it's followers a better understanding of how things will happen at the time of Christ's return, I do agree some probably believed it to be applicable to their time, but I feel it wasn't. \n \n Once again Orion I commend you on your knowledge of scripture...it's nice to see someone that has a thirst for knowledge and answers....\n \n Love in Christ...",

   "Hi, I'm new. Good topic.\n \n My understanding is that the end times refer to post crucifixion/resurrection history. All of the people who lived prior to Christ, did so before the sacrifice was made, and they will be judged accordingly. But God will take into account the fact that we (for the last 2000 years) have had a chance to recognize the sacrifice and respond to it. That is why even when writing 2000 years ago, Paul and the other apostles considered their time to be a part of the \"last days.\"\n \n According to the bible's timeline, post-resurrection history consists of only 1/3 of recorded history up to this date. Most of human history occurred prior to Christ.",

   "It's clear from Paul's advice not to get married (quoted earlier on this thread) is not because the end times are here in a general sense, but that they are coming very soon in a very clear sense - soon enough for marriage to be a bit pointless. That clearly didn't come true, and the nearness of Armageddon gets pushed back from Mark (the oldest of the gospels) in Luke and Matthew, as it becomes clear that it hasn't happened within the generation. \n \n The idea its already happened and that the resurrection was the second coming does not fit with Matthe 24, where the second coming is meant to be clear to all, as 'lightning in the east is seen even in the west'. Obviously the resurrection of Christ did not lead to all peoples being immediately aware of Him.",
