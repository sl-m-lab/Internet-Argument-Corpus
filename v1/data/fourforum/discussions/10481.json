   "It's true about my taste and it's true about my wealth\n But the sins you have were all caused by yourself\n And you can't find salvation in a book upon the shelf\n \n I never started any wars\n I never slept with any whores\n I don't spread my faith by knocking on any doors\n \n I never ate any apple that hung from any tree\n I shouted out my warnings as plainly as can be\n But in the end it's all the same as they simply blame me\n \n Blame Me.\n MuWaahaa-Haaa\n Blame Me.\n \n Is your daddy the one who beat you with his belt\n Dejected and rejected I know just how you felt\n At least you don't know how brimstone really smelt\n \n Oh how the mighty have such a long way to fall\n How do you apologize when He won't answer your call\n The Prodigal son just isn't the story that I saw.\n \n Don't kid yourself son you know it's all the same\n You're just another piece in His indecipherable game\n And when He's done playing He'll leave you with all the blame\n \n Blame Me.\n MuWaahaa-Haaa\n Blame Me.\n \n I'm not saying that I'm free from any guilt\n But upon my hands no blood was ever spilt\n Upon who's body was His temple really built\n \n When you open your mouth when you're down on your knees\n Think of who's the one whom you're really there to please\n Mass and Communal service that's not for the Jeez\n \n I'm sorry my son, you have my deepest sympathy\n You're just another pawn and it's plain for all to see\n But if it makes any difference you can simply blame me.\n \n Blame Me.\n MuWaahaa-Haaa\n Blame Me.\n \n \n \n \n *rough draft.",
