   "Alright as it is known throughout most churches they condemn drinking usually in most aspects however I've been contemplating a lot lately about it. First off the church often condemns those who say, go out to Hooters and have a beer with the buddies. I often wonder what Jesus would have done in today's society. With some promiscuous girl always at some bar it's hard to see Jesus putting himself in a compromising position, however I often think Jesus would be at the bars because lets face it, that's where you're going to find more sinners. \n \n Now I don't have my Bible with me right now, but in Proverbs it states several times about how Drunkeness is a brawler, and how bad drinking is....yet in the same hand we have Jesus drinking wine with his disciples, turning water into wine, and almost every ceremony and get together they have in the Bible involves drinking wine.\n \n So this is my take on drinking, maybe you can help out. I believe that it's ok to drink as long as you learn to have it in moderation and don't abuse it. Drunkeness is often condemned I believe due to the fact that when people get drunk they:\n 1. Do things they regret\n 2. Say things they regret\n 3. Often become violent and stupid\n So I believe that is why the Bible is so against drunkeness. However I believe if an individual is responsible when they drink and don't hurt others by their words or actions then there is nothing wrong. Some of my friends totally disagree with me and one of my non-christian friends argued that if I could justify drinking then he could justify smoking marijuana. So your input on this would be really appreciated....\n \n Love in Christ....",

   "I don't drink, but I see nothing particularly wrong with drinking in moderation. The reason a lot of Churches have been against alcohol is linked to the rise of the non-conformist movements in Britain. At the time gin was cheap and abundant, it was causing the poor to drown their sorrows and leave their families destitute. The non-conformist movement talked about \"the demon drink\" in the context of the effect it had on society and on families. Alcoholism is best combatted by teetotalism, and this is what the non-conformist churches advocated. The methodists I know have no relaxed their prohibitions on alcohol, though they still use grape juice for communion as many methodists are still teetotal.",

Fundamentalist churches, especially in the U.S. \"Bible belt\" often do. That's not most churches by far.\n \n More churches worldwide even use alcoholic wine in communion than those that do not.\n \n Second, I don't think we need to assume that there weren't Palestinian 1st century equivilent of bars back then. There's no record of Jesus ever visiting such a place, so I don't think He would have spent much time at Hooters at all.\n \n Because of the negativity associated with drinking in the prohibition years, to this day people here in the U.S. associate drinking mainly with wild partying or lwed behavior. But overseas in many countries, they are wine-cultures, and drinking is an everyday way of life. There's no stigma to it. I think that is more the way it probably was in Jesus' culture. I wish the U.S. was more that way.",
