I treat babies and infants well because I wouldn't have liked to have suffered under bad treatment by others when I was a baby.

Nobody expects a baby to treat adults well because a baby is utterly inexperienced in social interaction. Everyone understands this -we were all once babies after all and know how utterly clueless we were.

That does not mean that I do not have moral stances toward other species.

This is obviously in a pro-lifers criteria and I just want to point out that it is similiar in this respect.\n\n So far, the only species capable of making a moral consensus has been humans. We are getting into speculative areas here, but I can imagine the possibility in the next decades of human-animal hybrids (ex. someone is currently trying to patent the idea of a human chimp hybrid to fuel the debate). The question would then arise - what exactly is human? How much human DNA would make the hybrid a human vs another species? That would complicate matters that currently remain unresolved since those decisions have not had to be faced. \n \n The other rather unlikely direction (and awkward to bring up because of all of the UFO fanatics) is the idea of extraterrestrial intelligent life. The probabilities make it certain that there are planets out there hospitable to life. Is there other life out there? If so, can it have developed intelligence? Even if it had, is it possible to make contact over such long distances? All of these are unanswered questions but the hypothetical possibility is there of other sentient species with whom one might make a moral consensus. Given that hypothetical, I would favor humanity over other alien sentient species (if it came to an \"us\" vs \"them\" survival) but still would try to form a moral consensus with them. \n \n I am curious, what would your moral approach be to a human-chimp hybrid (assuming that one or many do end up getting born despite public protest) or the hypothetical of extraterrestrial intelligent life? It is an interesting question, I think, since religion does not seem to address these.\n \nI think anyone would admit that valuing life over life is a difficult thing to do.

   "Well, you still support or don't support wars and you must have reasons for giving or withholding that support. Do you have any guidelines for when you support a war that our government starts?\n It's a little off subject but I normally go with whether or not I trust the person making the decision. \n \n \nI would not have blamed my mother for aborting me if she had made that decision before I reached mental existence. \"I\" never would have existed so nobody would have been hurt. I don't see that much difference between a newly fertilized egg and an early fetus except in how much potential they have in becoming an existing \"someone\". Up to the point of mental existence, they are just various developmental stages of the body itself. As for potential, I do value it, but not nearly as much as I do a real existing person.\n \n It is not going in circles. It is based on the very essence of my view of what \"I\" am. I am not my body itself - I am my mental self with my body automatically tagging along. Science tells us that that mental self is determined by the functioning of the brain - the details of which are being progressively clarified with each decade of research. Perhaps there are souls (i.e. mental existence external to the body) and perhaps not - so far no evidence has shown itself so we cannot base any laws on unsupported hypotheses.\nSo based on this I assume your criteria is as follows: Those deserving of the rights you and I get (such as a right to life) are ones who mentally exist and who are of the same species as you and I (ie human).\n \n Is that a good overall summary?",

   "Exactly, I don't really get how many of these people who claim to be \"pro-life\", also support war (Iraq for example), or the death penalty. It seems to be self-contradictory: they care about foetuses that do not yet mentally exist, but support the killing of grown people with mental existance (or even in their terms, they would claim both to have \"souls\" or \"life\")\n\n I think that, for many on the religious right (and I am not necessarily including any particular posters here), the moral rules they follow are those dictated by religion. If those religious rules are contradictory then automatically that makes their moral stances contradictory. \n \n However, if there are good reasons given about when it is ok to kill then the stances might not necessarily be contradictory. It is a balance of values (just like our view of third trimester abortions) that plays itself out. I, for one, am quite curious about where the religious right (and others in general) place this balance. That is why I am trying to get Steeeeve to state where he places the balance of valuing life in other situations - ex. war. It is a tough problem - that balance of values - but it has to be explored if one does not want to follow a contradictory moral stance.",

From my sympathy with the suffering of animals, I would place some limit on their exploitation or hunting and leave them sanctuaries (for both their own sake and for the sake of human enjoyment in seeing wild animals) but would certainly not go as far as to give them equal treatment - ex. the right to life outside of self-defense. I do not think we would survive as a species if we really implemented equal treatment across the board to all sentient animals. \n \n Since we both agree on the priority of humans over animals (perhaps for different reasons and to different degrees) and since the abortion debate centers around the human species, I don't see much further relevance in bringing up \"why human?\" in this particular forum.

One can place more or less value on an object and, in this case, I personally think that the embryo has some value because of its potential.

   "This is still a value on a species though...which was my point. You still find an inherent value in a human as a species.\n\n It is empathy that is the main driver of my moral stance - empathy for others and, if you will, for myself. On average, I can't help but have more sympathy toward humans than animals since I myself am of the species human - so it is in the empathy toward humans where my main moral stance lies.\n \n I also value other things that have nothing to do with empathy - ex. the POTENTIAL of an embryo to become someone I can empathize with. I can also value the abstract concept of humanity as a species. I might value the cleanliness of my environment, or the existence of greenery and some level of wildlife in my neighborhood, etc. All of these values are much lower than the values I place on beings that I can empathize with. The core of my moral stance is to treat others as I would have myself be treated and that is based on empathy and partly on selfish desire for reciprication (I also want to be treated as I would have myself be treated and this is part of the group \"deal\"). \n \n However, my preference toward human mentally existing beings over other mentally existing beings is not because of an abstract concept of \"humanity\". It is the same thing that might drive you to protect a beloved member of your own family more so than a stranger. It is a bias based on ones emotional attachment to those individuals in ones own group. My preference for humanity is just such a preference toward individuals in my species group of human. I have on average more sympathy toward the average human than for the average member of other species. (I admit that I have much more sympathy for my cat than I have to a serial killer, but those are occasional exceptions to the trend). However, to have any empathy or sympathy AT ALL, a mental existence is necessary.\n \nMy point here is to empathize the key word \"can\". You stated that a human can grow a mental consensus and thus you find this worthy of value. I just don't understand why you don't place the same worthy value on something that can develop the mental existence.\n\n Human beings on average can form a moral consensus which is why I value humans as a species over other species. But the very moral consensus itself - i.e. \"I will treat others as I would have myself be treated\" - assumes a mental existence since (from self-observation) I view the core of myself as my mental existence and, frankly, I would find nothing morally wrong if my existence had been snuffed out before I came to exist mentally. Nobody would have been hurt. There would be no \"I\" that would have come into existence to regret my loss.\n \n You asked this same question to phyllis sometime and she came up with a good answer. I believe it went something like it didn't matter how many pieces you are in and where they were located..all those things make up you.\n\n But in what way are those parts still \"you\"? How are \"you\" in those parts? People transplant live organs from one person to another all the time. If you were to donate your organ to someone, does that mean that the person who now has your organ is also \"you\"?",
