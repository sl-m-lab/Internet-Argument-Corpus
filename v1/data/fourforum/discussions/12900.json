   "Continuing to show deference to religious practice in Texas, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday that a town near Corpus Christi violated state law when it zoned two Christian halfway houses out of existence.\n \n In a 9-0 ruling, the court said the Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act entitles faith-based operations to greater legal protection than similar secular operations.\n \n The ruling - the court's first look at the 1999 religious freedom act - means cities will have to prove that zoning laws affecting religious activities are the least restrictive way to further a \"compelling\" government function, such as providing for public safety. That test, developed under First Amendment case law, is intended to be difficult to meet.\n \n \"This means that in zoning cases, you have to give churches special treatment,\" said Hiram Sasser, litigation director for Liberty Legal Institute, a conservative nonprofit group that advocates for religious rights and that appealed the case.\n \n \"You have to have very special reasons for telling a church you can't locate here and locate there. That's going to be a tough burden for cities,\" Sasser said. \"This is going to be an important tool for churches, synagogues, mosques and all types of religious institutions.\" \n\n In ruling, Supreme Court says religion deserves greater protection\n \n \"Hey. I want to build a halfway house in this residential district.\"\n \"Nope. Sorry. Can't do that. It's against the law.\"\n \"What if I told you that I want to do it not cause of secular humanitarian reasons, but for religious reasons?\"\n \"Oh. Okay. You've got a special privilege then...\"\n emoticon_xdonno",
