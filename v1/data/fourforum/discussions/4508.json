Okay buddy, first of all Communism has never been tried anywhere in the planet during any era. Second of all, China wasn't never Communistic, but Maoist and now is basically a mix of heavy state control and basic capitalism with little worker, consumer and enviromental protection laws. The USSR was never communist either, but Stalinist and Leninst. \n \n Of course that doesn't mean it will work, Communism, opposed to communism is anti-human behavior. Lower case communism is how most people refer to Communism but don't exactly understand the differences.\n \n First of all Communism is basically rule by the poleterian (worker), not rule by a few central people like Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and a few others. \n \n Second Communism requires a completely different mindset then the one capitalistic countries grew up with. There is no sense of private ownership, but complete public ownership. It's not easy to understand or conceptualize in the beginning. communism in practice had public property for the majority, and wealth and private for the ruling class. \n \n Third, everyone is basically trying to look out for everyone else. Once again, very contrary to cutthroat capitalism. To each their own, meaning everyone produces for the good of the entire community. If you need 5 loaves of bread for your family, you get 5, and if you need 2, you get two, regardless of your personal productivity. Hence why the entire idea of Communism is anti-innovation.",

   "I would suggest that you might first understand what your own position is, your own philosophy. You may find you don't actually agree with the things that on the surface, you seem to support, or reject. \"Hating\" sounds emotional, and this is a philosophical topic really, not an emotional one.\n \n Second, Marx was essentially a philosopher with interesting ideas, that were founded on what I think are flawed premises. Namely that people are not inherently selfish. Yes, his idea was to improve the lives of everyone, through the rejection of selfishness (capitalism). What an evil person right? I mean, bettering life for everyone? What a horrible goal!! Capitalistic governments, didn't really like this and waged war on such governments. Why? Because they were rich and powerful and did not...ahem, want to see their way of life changed (among other reasons, some much more praise-worthy, that's biased for contrast). \n \n Ultimately it may come down to two differences in philosophy:\n \n 1. Do you think people are naturally selfish?\n 2. Do you think people are naturally altrustic?\n \n Would a system designed contrary to what you think is \"natural\" have a chance of succeeding in the long term?\n \n I think #1, and no.

Largely because it accuratly describes and accounts for certain important underlying structures of our contemporary world. It is also flecxible enough to apply to more than just issues concerning economic classes.\n \n I find marxist approach to economics interesting from a historic point of view, but not that useful.

This perception, while largely unfounded, has given even the more socialistic governments in europe an argument, or scapegoat if you will, to use in order to motivate unpopular cuts in social spending and reforms of corrupt and broken systems. If used correctly, it could be used to reform the vast social safety nets to become more efficient, more consistent, less exploitable and perhaps even less generous. What this would mean is probably quite country specific. For Germany it could mean a reform for the labour market. In France it could mean a reform of the agricultural and \"small-town\" polycies. In Denmark, Sweden and Norway it could mean lower but more enforced taxes, less and more monitored transfers and more emphasize on governmental production of goods and services. In the US it could perhaps mean a reform of the transfer and labour systems that results in a large dependant class. Simply put; the globalization card could be played to achieve political support for un-popular reforms that would restore the efficiency of the various polito-economic systems we have throughout the western world. It could also be used in order to moderate the increasing demand for governmentally produced services that doesn`t improve productivity as fast as the industrial production. \n \n Or perhaps the new wave of information technology will deliver some form of sollution where governmental services could improve productivity as fast as the private manufacturing sector. Allthough I strongly doubt it.",

The important thing to remember in this case is that this kind of thing can work fine on a small, community level, but it is a completely different animal when applied to the large governmental level. Look at American communes. They work very differently, not just better, but very differently. But even on this level plently of people try to take advantage of it. Just ask a hippie or someone in the Rainbow Family. On top of everything else, this kind of thing isn't wholly Marxism either.\n \n Again, the problems that communist governments face and have faced in the past, are not simply due just to human failing. There are inherent flaws in Marxism--the labor theory of value, no real motivation for advancement of any kind (technologically, economically, etc.). It was a nice dream, and it has given us very interesting ways of looking at the world, but on a practical level, it is only  a dream.\n \n \nYes it does matter.

Class-interests are indeed on of the more important interests in political and economic life. Even though I wouldn`t go so far to claim that it is the \"mother of all interests\".\n \n \nThis is something that can work in reality:\n < Joe becomes dictator of the world and kills everbody else.\n < There is no one left to use force against Joe, so the state becomes useless and disappears. We have an anarchist utopia now because no one uses force anymore.\n \n This is Marxism in bullets:\n < Proletarians hijack the state and use it to destroy the bourgeoisie\n < With the bourgeoisie gone, there is no one to oppress the proletarians, so the state becomes useless and disappears. We have an anarchist utopia now because no one uses force anymore.\n \n The problem with Marxism is that it fails to recognize that proletarians can oppress other proletarians. Collective groups do not function unanimously, especially a group so large as the proletarians. A proletarian can use force against another proletarian.\n\n \n Why do you think Marx believed that the state would wither and die? Because the existance of the state creates yet another master class, the political class. This class would naturally oppress the proletariate which in turn would lead to classwarfare which would end with the emancipation of the proletariate.\n \n Now, I don`t believe this is how things \"must\" go (or even will go), but there is nothing in your description of the reality or future that contradicts Marx`s ideas at this point.",

A government that would nationalise the means of production, abolish priviledges of class, religion, gender etc. This government would act in the interest of the proletariate, as the proletariate would control it through direct democracy. However, as time progresses, the state will eventually breed a new class with interests of their own. The political class, a new master class. This class would oppress the interests of the proletariate in order to pursue their own interests. Therefor, Marx reasoned, man can only be emancipated once the state has withered and died. Only then can man be free from oppression.",

A democracy is necessary for socialism, he also stated that the only way that this state would be overthrown is by a 2nd revolution or if it reverted to capitalism. \n \n Some people also say that the reason that the Socialist revolution failed in the USSR and created a degenerated workers state is that a Socialist revolution occurred in a Underdeveloped Country instead of a fully developed Capitalist Country that had the resources in place that could be brought under the control of the workers, Because Russia did not have these resources in place at the time it was easy for an Authoritarian Ruler such as Stalin to take control and replace a uncertain Socialist Democracy with the focused boot heel of a Dictatorship.",
