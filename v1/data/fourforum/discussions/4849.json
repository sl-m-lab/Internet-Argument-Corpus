I could go a day without worrying about history, but not without music or art. The problem is that the focus of education has shifted to pass tests, and there aren't many prestigious art/music tests so they just decide to cut them. Mr. Holland's Opus comes to mind when thinking about this topic. I have played piano since I was 5 years old (10 years now) and up until 8th grade I was at a private school which had a piano teacher offering lessons. During school I would go down and have my lesson (it was Montessori so we didn't have specific set classes) and practice at home. It has meaned a lot to me and I don't like that even the music classes that schools do offer are just a joke to fill the required one year of fine arts credit.",

I don't see how sports are any less important than \"the basics\". They teach teamwork, hard work, and they also generally keep you in really good shape (something that seems to be lacking today in teens at high school). You can learn just as much from sports as you can from \"the basics\" just as you can learn a lot from music/art. I don't see anything particularly good about \"the basics\" except for that there are tests you have to pass in those subjects. How often do you use calculus in everyday life? Then explain to me why our school requires it for graduation (actually I like math, but it's not as relevant to life as sports and art/music) yet all you need is 1 PE credit and 1 fine art credit. English is important but in everday life how often do you need to know that it's there instead of their? Yes it's important but so is this other stuff. What I'm trying to say is that math, history, english, what you'd consider \"the basics\" are all extremely important. But so is PE, sports, and the fine arts.",

This is probably more because of the way sports are in schools rather than what they could be. The values in sports and surrounding them in high schools have been contaminated. Athletes are often prized above all else, athletes are often passed along no matter how well they are actually doing, and sports overall seem to hinder individual development for the sake of the group. I know that things can be learned when having to be a part of a group, but these things also have a downside.\n The point of all this is merely to say that I think the arts are more valuable than athletics.

   "boy are you wrong here. Please explain to me what you get out of math that makes it so important? Our math teacher even admits that the only reason math is a top priority in the US is that kids do horrible in international math competition. This was during the cold war and we wanted to be better at them commies at everything.\n\n Talking about different levels here - entry level schooling is going to teach you the important bits of maths that you will need (precentages, algebra, etc). Higher level maths is really only useful is you plan to do higher level science as well (physics is pratically just maths, and chemistry and biology need the statistical side of things)\n \n \n\n Why? Please don't make unsubstantiated claims like this. What benefit do I gain from learning calculus? (yes I enjoy doing math but I don't see how it applies to life as much as music and the arts do.\n\n Its all about rates on graphs and how you get them. Do science or engineering and you will need them. I've had to use them doing a biology degree. \n \n \n\n Why? Music is just as important as math. Once you can add and multiply, calculate taxes, estimate distances (which is way undertaught in schools these days) and other basic math skills you really don't need to be able to graph conic sections, work with imaginary numbers, factor complex algebraic expressions, or any of the other things we are learning unless you become a mathmetician. If you learn an instrument or how to read music, how to do some kind of art, you will remember and apreciate it for the rest of your life.\n \n You need maths for science, music is just nice for its own sake - and is useless if you lack any real talent. Sadly, I lack it. I can play basic stuff on piano and saxophone but didn't learn this in music classes anyway but really this is completely useless. Music is only useful if you are good, and even then only really if you want to be a muscian.\n I can appreciate music without having to be able to play it - if you arn't any good it just becomes a chore playing it, especially if you can't play the kind of music you like.\n \n \n\n Why? I really don't think this issue has to do with what class you take but the kind of kid who would sign up for it. If music was optional and I didn't care about school or music I wouldn't take the class. Same with advanced maths or any elective class, but there has been research that shows how music helps the brain develop.\n Again we are dealing with non-optional stuff here. Those who don't care about school completely are not going to benefit, but those who might learn toward that way would benefit from music and other 'fun' lessons as it stops them becoming totally bored in school and giving up on it.\n \n \n\n What's different from pre-schoolers and high-schoolers in terms of teaching them music?\n Pre-schoolers can't handle all the maths they need if almost anything (no idea how much they teach, can't remember) and high schoolers already know all they need unless they want to do something where they need it. Its the primary school kids that need to be taught maths because primary and secondary school maths is the stuff you use in everyday life. Pre-schoolers would benefit from music, certainly and so would other students but not as much as basic maths.\n \n \n\n I'm in high school and really have appreciated learning to play the piano. Even when I grow up, I can always just relax and play some music. How many people grow up and decide for fun to do some math to relax?\n I can't stand the piano on its own, and could never play for fun (I'm too critical). If I want to listen to good music I like, I'll put on a CD and relax. Did you actually learn to play the piano in music class or did you take seperate lessons?\n \n\n I actually don't mind not making it a requirement but it's when there is no budget there and the classes are horrible. Our school requires one full year of fine arts. So all the basic fine arts are really easy, so everyone can pass and are a joke. Most kids enjoy their sleep time there.

But for schools to cut the budget either entirely or just make all the arts classes BS classes, that's where I have a problem.\n\n I agree, but we are dealing with a theorectical case where there just isn't the option for good music classes. Music is desirable to have - but if there is really no choice, you just don't have the budget, it should go before certain other subjects.

That's like asking which would be better, english or math if we only had the budget for one. Children should simply have the experience of \"acedemic\" subjects - ones that will be on tests - as well as subjects such as music/art. And someone earlier stated a statistic that music helps increase thinking skills, so it does help in everyday life as well. Should it be required? I don't think so, but quality music classes should be offered at school.

   "wow.... off track there.\n My monkey hates soup so it doesn't matter. (I have no clue who or what you were talking about.\n \n My opinion: ONCE schools learn how to spend their money (like not on TV's in the cafeteria where they play cartoons, and cut down on the pop machines) they might find that music isn't completely unaffordable.\n \n I went to 2 two schools. The band junkie school, and the school where the music program was actually a joke. Like a real Joke. As in people made fun of it.\n I'll say when I was caught up in my music school, I was more interested in my classes, I was more motivated, and it was a way to express myself.\n The next school... well, I kinda stopped going there. Long story.\n \n In a public schoo, if music is offered, it's much cheaper (even free if you qualify) than it is if you're in a community, or private music organization.\n It's always the first program to get cut. Most classes can be supplemented by taking something similar. Not music.\n Phy ed? Highschool phyed is a joke. I'd pick music over it any day. \n If you really care about your body and have any self respect at all, join track or cross country, swim team or gymnastics or something.\n As far as enhancing goes, Most, NOT all, of the major music students were the people to go to if you needed help in math or physics. I was a music junkie and those are my two strong points as well. People argue over proof for that though. That's just speaking from experience.\n \n Now, if you're introducing classical music at the late highschool level, to someone who's never listened to it before, I'm sure they will get NO enjoyment from it. Now, if you bring a person up on it... well, I can tell the difference as far as personalitly goes from 3 of my friends, one conveniently brought up on classic, one on none, and one on country.

This will always be true - it's an acquired taste that a lot don't care for.

   "I'm confused now, you want those doing music courses in high school to get exposure to classical music but you don't want it to be part of the class? Not saying they have to like it, but you feel that they should at the least have an opinion.\n \n Probably very few people really have that much exposure to other types of modern music or at least I doubt many actually made a proper descion about what they like - today music is an integral part of clique indentity and is likely going to be dissmissed in the same way as classical might if its not part of it.\n What about popular musics that have now gone out of fashion such as swing and jazz?\n \n Its all about a question of taste, but you have to take it further than this is you want to study it as a subject, otherwise they may as well just be allowed a CD player and some headphones in class. I have no problem with exposing students to musical types that they are unfamilar with, I just don't think it should be left at 'so they might appreciate it' or get to like it - its the same as with english, you don't need to like a book to be able to critisise it and see the techniques used, same with music.\n \n Given the incredable sucess of modern pop, is it just 'better' music than other genres or are there reasons why things become popular - how far do things things extend between genres etc. If pop is so popular why is classical music still used in film soundtracks and adverts.\n \n Considering classical music seperate from modern forms of music is a bad plan, not to mention that a lot of classical music is still being written and is modern anyway, surely to paint an accurate portrait of the style you are going to have to take this into account.

(I could teach you how to read music, I could teach you about the history of classical music, I could teach you how, say, a symphony is constructed; but I could not teach you the enjoyment of a piece of music. That would be down to your acquisition of a taste for it.). \n \n You kept (like a nit-picker) returning to the same point about \"forcing\" students to listen to classical music when I had explained over and over again that you can't get people to enjoy something by compulsion. You can't even get someone to learn a fact based subject if they don't want to; the teacher can drone on, but what he has to say can (and does) go in one ear and out of the other. \n \n Much of what you had to say was barely coherent rambling from one curious expedient to another.

   "I apologise, but if you read through your posts you come off as very agressive.\n \n The problem I have with your idea, is that you haven't made it very clear how you would have it work. Is this oppertunity for learning to appreciate classical music within optional music lessons or seperate from it (i.e either a specific classical music module of the course, or a student orchestra with some additional studies as well)?\n \n The other point was why focus so much on classical music? The elitism comment was to be expected because throughout education there are forms of art that are considered better than the rest - teaching Brittany Spears in music lessons seems like PC gone mad and is going to run into the problem that the students will probably know more than the teacher in a lot of cases.\n However, this isn't what I was advocating nor would the response to this be teach 'proper' music. Far as I am concerned Classical music is no better than any other, I like other styles more but don't consider them better than classical either.\n \n If you want to expose kids to unfamiliar forms of music I think to limit it to just classical is really being excessively focused for a music course unless you are going to offer a range of them (i.e music of the early modern period, music and sound technology, 20th century music) but this I think is beyond the ability of most high schools to offer. In my opinion, if you have chosen to do music as an option you wouldn't then get the choice of which styles of music you take the oppertunity to be exposed to - there would be a range of styles that course covers alongside their history and relevance.\n \n I have no problem with kids being given the oppertunity to be exposed to classical music so that they can gain an appreciation, but I don't think music classes should focus specifically on it at the expense of other genres and I don't think it would really be workable outside of a music class (other than a school orchestra which just happens to play classical music)",

   "As a music teacher, I must jump in here. First of all, music should never be taught completely out of context. Music involves math, history, auditory skills, movement skills, science and foreign language.

It is the only subject I know of that crosses the boundaries of every other subject in school. Eliminate it from the school system and you are taking away a highly valuable dimension of education. The only reason no one thinks it's important today is that somewhere along the line, people stopped learning it, and now it's looked at as extra-curricular, when infact, it should be co-curricular.

This results in loss of money. Which in turn results in people reading this incorrectly as lack of interest.\n \n \nThe other thing you fail to grasp is this[*]: Who would you have pay for the music? The government, right? Where does the government get it's money? That's right, tax-payers. So in effect you are paying more than you would spend (or else they would be self-sustaining) and you might not even want to see it. That makes no sense, make people pay more than they would anyway, disguised as taxes, but make everyone pay, not just the ones who want to see it.\n\n \n You are not always going to like or even use where your tax dollars go. I don't like dropping bombs on innocent civilians, and I vote accordingly, but here I am helping to fund the carnage. On the other hand I have no kids, but I vote in favor of increasing school levies b/c I see it as an investment to the community. The arts add positively to the community. Orchestras, ballets, etc. have a job to do also: they need to program accordingly to catch back their audiences and create new interest in youth, particularily.\n \n *Not very nice.",

   "The source is my own experience.\n \n The experiment of playing classical music as background aid to \"study\", which I witnessed, turned out like this:\n \n A group of well motivated easily managed students were set to work on independent projects without teacher input. Classical music (bland baroque stuff) was played as a background \"civilising influence\". The students soon complained about the \"noise\", and the music was switched off.\n \n Similar background music was played in a class of unruly students on the theory that it would \"calm\" their aggressive impulses. It did no such thing, and the hi-fi equipment ended up on the classroom floor !\n \n If Vivaldi could provoke a mere classroom riot, it might be presumed that after a little Stravinsky, the school would have been burned down.\n\n \n .. how sad is that. you have my sympathies. it's a shame that your only experience with music turned out to be so tragic",

   "music in schools should stay because learning music and the way music works makes you think more and helps the brain learn. when learning an instrunment you have to really practice and learn what you are doing. this also helps keep children off the streets and away from the bad things that they could fall into.",

   "Being a person who stinks at math and languages, I have to say not haveing music and art in our schools would have killed my self esteam and made it even harder to learn to read and write. Anyways our society relys just as much on art and music as it does on math (imagin an artist had never drawn youre refigerater, it would still keep things cold, but it might not look so nice and would probobly not have some of the nice features it has). Also imagin if we all became workaholics, we would not have music to help relive our stress. Besides all subjects are intertwined, my older sister is in colledge studying to becom an architec, she says that it is not just a lot of math, but a lot of art aswell. Not to mention all the great anchent civilisations had art and music. Yes it should, it is obvious.",
