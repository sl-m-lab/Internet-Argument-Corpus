Do you have any idea how many paratroops it would take to establish a beach head in the US? You are looking at 100,000 troops, minimum.

   "I fail to understand why many Americans encourage politicians to enable a large standing military strung out all over the world that we simply can't afford. I would think their insecurities should be placated by the fact we can almost instantly destroy any nation in the world attacking us without the use of troops.\n\n \n Personally I think this is because most americans fall into the \"middle class\" (soon to become \"lower class\"), a precarious position at best. They live in houses made out of cardboard and sawdust, are up to their eyeballs in debt, and are scared to death of anything that threatens their way of life (though why somebody would want to live like that is far beyond my comprehension). I think that having large numbers of men with guns runnign around working in their \"best iterests\" is very comforting to the sheeple. \n \n On top of that, I do not think that most americans DO mind the fact that we have used our military to ensure trade dominance, even if it is by turning children into virtual slaves, installing tyrants and dictators, and killing off the competition. At the end of the day, americans tend to be rather selfish. Sure they are willing to donate a few bucks to a relief fund for a natural disater, but there is no way they are going to take a 20% cost of living hit just because their current level of comfort is built on the misery of millions. \n \n \n We have reached a diffiuclt point now where some of those millions are hitting back. IF you look at actions like this traditionally, the reality of the matter is that as time goes by, the anti american forces will become more organized and larger. There are anti american militant groups all of the world, the arabs are just he first ones to strike. It will not be long before they have formed alliances with similar groups in Asia, S America, and the former soviet union. Then we are screwed, especially the middle class, unless we resort to a police state to maintain order, which leads to a whole different set of problems.",

   "our military leading up to WWI was incredibly small. We still managed to mobilize and fight the war when the time came. Following WWI, we disbanded the vast majority of the military.
