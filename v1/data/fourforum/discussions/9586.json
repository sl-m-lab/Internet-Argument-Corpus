   "\"Now, make no mistake, Iran poses a threat to our allies and our interests in the region and beyond, including the United States. The Iranian president has held a conference denying the Holocaust and has issued bellicose statement after bellicose statement calling for Israel and the United States to be wiped off the map. His statements are even more disturbing and urgent when viewed in the context of the regime's request to acquire nuclear weapons. The regime also uses its influence and resources in the region to support terrorist elements that attack Israel. Hezbollah's attack on Israel this summer, using Iranian weapons, clearly demonstrates Iran's malevolent influence even beyond its borders. We also have evidence, although it is by no means conclusive, of attacks using Iranian-supplied or manufactured weaponry against our own American soldiers. As I have long said and will continue to say, U.S. policy must be clear and unequivocal: We cannot, we should not, we must not permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons. And in dealing with this threat, as I've also said for a long time, no option can be taken off the table.\"\n \n who said it and what does it bode?",

For example, consistent pot shots at the president because she thinks that pleases the crowds, rather than giving solid solutions herself. We already know how she feels about Bush; I'd rather hear what she would DO. She wants to be a new \"Thatcher\", so she says? In her dreams.\n \n The one exception that I know of is that she refuses to directly apologize to the anti-war movement for her vote to go into Iraq. I give her kudos for that, not because the vote was right, but because she shouldn't have to apologize for it, IMO. She didn't know it was going to turn out this way any more that Bush did.\n \n Obama, at this point, looks like he's the rising star. It concerns me though, because no one really knows much about him. At least with Hillary we pretty much know what we'd be getting. I also think people don't need to automatically assume that either one of these candidates will be our next president. Someone will eventually emerge from the Republican party as well that will change the equation.",

   "\n Obama, at this point, looks like he's the rising star. It concerns me though, because no one really knows much about him. At least with Hillary we pretty much know what we'd be getting.\n\n That's exactly why I like Obama over Clinton. With Clinton we know we'll get someone who'll do whatever she thinks looks good: a trend follower. Obama says he has a vision he wants to follow: a trend setter. So with Clinton we know we'll get an ineffective leader who won't make the tough calls if they might be unpopular. At least with Obama we have a chance that he'll actually try to do what's right, as opposed to what's popular. A gamble? Or course, but what election isn't? At least we have some time to check things out before we need to roll the dice.\n \n \n\n I also think people don't need to automatically assume that either one of these candidates will be our next president. Someone will eventually emerge from the Republican party as well that will change the equation.\n\n Are people assuming that the Dems have 08 wrapped up? Any Republican that distances himself from Bush enough certainly stands a chance.",
