   "Since I've seen a few threads devolve into \"i'm a conservative and you're a liberal\" I thought I might throw this one up here to try to figure out what most people see as liberal or conservative (or the result of liberalism or conservatism). I'll list some things (or supply your own) and then I'd like for folks to label these things as liberal, conservative, neither, or NA.\n \n Here goes:\n -----------\n \n 1. Interstate Highway System\n \n 2. Separation of Church and State\n \n 3. Medicare\n \n 4. FDIC\n \n 5. Federal Reserve\n \n 6. IRS\n \n 7. Environmental Protection Agency\n \n 8.

   "Here's my opinions\n \n note: when I say \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" I mean classic conservative and the new liberal (socialist) not the classic liberal, which is closer to today's \"conservative.\" By classic conservative I mean: limited govt involvement in business and personal affairs, individual freedom is more important than equality, favoring fiscal responsibilty above social justice. By liberal I mean: the latest american definition, which tends to mean favoring that govt's responsibilty to its citizens, govt stays out of the citizens pursuit of happiness, and (from Wikipedia ) \"to expect that the community will regulate and influence the economy as a means to achieve social justice.\"\n \n \n1. Interstate Highway System\n\n Liberal (all highways should be private toll roads)\n \n2. Separation of Church and State\n\n Conservative if you think it's what the founding fathers intended\n \"Liberal\" (really progressive) if you don't\n \n\n 3. Medicare\n\n Liberal\n \n\n 4. FDIC\n\n Liberal (from \"to expect that the community will regulate and influence the economy as a means to achieve social justice.\")\n \n\n 5. Federal Reserve\n\n Liberal (same explanation)\n \n6. IRS\n\n Liberal (same)\n \n\n 7. Environmental Protection Agency\n\n Liberal? (can one be a conservative and not a conservationist? Teddy Roosevelt started the National Park System, which is really an agency that regulates land usage.)\n \n8. Food and Drug Administration\n\n Liberal \n \n\n 9. US Department of Agriculture\n\n Liberal (from Wikipedia definition)\n \n\n 10. Transportation Security Agency\n\n Conservative\n \n\n 11. No Child Left Behind\n\n Liberal\n \n12. Federal Desegregation\n\n Liberal (should private entities be forced to segregate?)\n \n\n 13. Affirmative Action\n\n Liberal\n \n14. NAFTA\n\n Conservative (can't get much more conservative than free trade)\n \n15. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n\n Liberal\n \n\n 16. National Endowment for the Arts\n\n Liberal\n \n17. National Science Foundation\n\n Liberal\n \n\n 18. National Institutes of Health\n\n Liberal \n \n19. FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency)\n\n Liberal\n \n20. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)\n\n Liberal\n \n21. Roe Vs. Wade (the ruling)\n\n Conservative if you think the fetus is part of a woman's body\n Liberal if you think it's not\n \n22. War to stop genocide\n\n LIBERAL\n \n\n 23. Pre-emptive war\n\n either (depends on what you're pre-empting)\n \n24. Enforcing Corporate Moral Responsibilty\n\n Liberal\n \n25. Enforcing Personal Moral Responsibilty\n\n Liberal\n \n \n Well, most of my choices were liberal.\n All of the govt agencies are those that, by the Wikipedia definition: \"American liberals adopted in the 20th century an agenda in which individuals have a right, as members of the community, to expect that the community will regulate and influence the economy as a means to achieve social justice.\" In addition to the word economy, I would also add \"society.\"\n \n If we were as conservative as we can get, then the government would have only a few responsibilities: to provide for the common defense and protect citizens rights to life, liberty, and property (which common defense falls under). \n \n But wait, let's think about this. A conservative govt's responsibility is mainly to protect its citizens' rights. Wouldn't breathing air polluted by a heavy metals plant be an infringement on my rights? Would a bank failing and losing my savings be an infringement on my rights? Would buying a food or drug that may harm me despite the seller's claims be a violation of my rights? Would my rights be violated by the radiation leaking from an unregulated nuclear plant?\n \n So with my new realizations my answers become:\n \n \n1. Interstate Highway System\n\n Liberal (no one said I was born with the right to drive between states on well-maintained superhighways free of charge)\n \n2. Separation of Church and State\n\n Conservative if you think it's what the founding fathers intended\n \"Liberal\" (really progressive) if you don't\n \n\n 3. Medicare\n\n Liberal (or is healthcare part of the right to life?)\n \n\n 4. FDIC\n\n Conservative (but shouldn't it be a private corporation?)\n \n\n 5. Federal Reserve\n\n Conservative (or is it? do we have a right to a stable currency and does a board of 12 men have a right to decide cost and availability of money and credit in the economy?)\n \n6. IRS\n\n Liberal (no one said I have the right to have a centralized federal revenue and taxation agency audit my finances)\n \n\n 7. Environmental Protection Agency\n\n Conservative (I DO have the right to breathe clean air and not run the risk of drinking water contaminated by someone elses carlessness.)\n \n8. Food and Drug Administration\n\n Conservative (it protects my right to eat safe foods and take safe drugs)\n \n\n 9. US Department of Agriculture\n\n Both (it actually has diverse funtions some of which protect people, but a lot are there to regulate the agriculture industry, subsidize farms, etc.)\n \n\n 10. Transportation Security Agency\n\n Conservative (part of defense)\n \n\n 11. No Child Left Behind\n\n Liberal\n \n12. Federal Desegregation\n\n Liberal (for private entities) Conservative (for public entities)\n \n\n 13. Affirmative Action\n\n Liberal (period)\n \n14. NAFTA\n\n Conservative (still)\n \n15. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n\n Conservative\n \n\n 16. National Endowment for the Arts\n\n Liberal\n \n17. National Science Foundation\n\n Liberal\n \n\n 18. National Institutes of Health\n\n Liberal\n \n19. FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency)\n\n Liberal (No one said I have the right to govt help when an earthquake levels my home.)\n \n20. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)\n\n Liberal (Like all govt research institutions.)\n \n21. Roe Vs. Wade (the ruling)\n\n Conservative if you think the fetus is part of a woman's body\n Liberal if you think it's not (same as above)\n \n22. War to stop genocide\n\n LIBERAL \n \n\n 23. Pre-emptive war\n\n Liberal if you think the war is not for defense\n Conservative if you think it is\n \n24. Enforcing Corporate Moral Responsibilty\n\n Liberal (it would only be conservative if the specific moral responsibilities being enforced would protect a person's natural rights.)\n \n25. Enforcing Personal Moral Responsibilty\n\n Liberal (But, I really mean all moral responsibilities that are not involved with violent crimes and such. I guess the statement was ambiguous.)\n \n Anyway, what I think I'm trying to get across is the fact that people are throwing these words around, but they can be quite confusing since they may mean slightly different things to different people in different circumstances.\n \n For instance, take the prohibition of alcohol.\n To me, this is liberalism. Wait, it can't be liberalism, since it infringes on personal freedom. Wait, don't conservatives advocate that? Well, conservatives couldn't be in favor of prohibition because it's not very traditional. There was never a ban on it before. This is a very progressive measure, then. But, wasn't it supported by fundamentalist Christians? They aren't very progressive right? I hope you see the dilemma.\n \n \n \n \n ...",
