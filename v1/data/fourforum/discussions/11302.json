Well, Mr. Obama and everyone on the forum, if you have a better idea to lower gas prices, then why don't you share it with us?",

   "Cheap fuel leads to massive energy consumption, and massive CO2 emissions (not to mention other pollutants). The only way alternative energy sources are going to come on-stream is with significant public subsidy to prime the pumps (so to speak), or by conventional fuels becoming so expensive that alternative sources are an economically no-brainer investment for private capital. Given the lack of political will to do the former, I'll settle for the latter. Short term pain, long term gain.\n \n Raising the cost of fuel raises substantially the cost of items that are not fuel efficient, and makes much less difference to those which are. Cheap fuel creates a perverse incentive to pollute more.",

Even if you do produce more crude you don't have the refining capability to make a difference to end prices.\n All this waffle about increased production is just propaganda by politicians worried about declining poll ratings.\n\n \n It is a global oil market, so demand decreases in the west CAN lower prices. That means driving less, buying less plastic ####, etc...\n \n The idea that drilling more is going to help is is just not sound. Look at rig counts. For the last several years the US has literally been running more active drill rigs than the rest of the world combined. Literally EVERY rig we have is out there working, we are building them as fast as we can, and even rigs that have not even been started yet are booked for their entire useful life. Even with all that, not only have we not managed to decrease oil prices, our oil production continues to fall. \n \n Shutting down speculation will just drain liquidity from the market and raise prices in the medium/long run. Spot prices, oil that you pay for and take physical delivery of TODAY have actually been running HIGHER than futures prices so it is hard to believe that speculators are driving prices up rather than fundamentals. \n \n In the end it does not matter whether we open those off shore areas to drilling. They would need deepwater rigs to drill there, and every deepwater rig on the planet is booked for AT LEAST the next 5 years and it takes a full year to move one into position, so it would be 6 years before we would see anything at all from them. The DOE says more like 12 when you figure in another 2 years for seismic exploration and mapping, predictable delays, etc..\n \n IMO we should wait until November for the IEAs depletion report to come out before we consider tapping any new supplies. It will be a pretty good indicator as to whether we have passed or are at peak oil or not. If we are, I say we leave it in the ground for our kids. They will have FAR more need of it, and better uses for it, 20 yrs down the line than we do now.",
