   "Chairman Issa Subpoenas ATF for 'Project Gunrunner' Documents\n \n \nWASHINGTON. D.C. - Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), the Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform today announced the issuance of a subpoena to the Department of Justices' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) for documents related to the highly controversial \"Project Gunrunner.\"\n \n \"The unwillingness of this Administration - most specifically the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms - to answer questions about this deadly serious matter is deeply troubling,\" said Chairman Issa. \"Allegations surrounding this program are serious and the ability of the Justice Department to conduct an impartial investigation is in question. Congressional oversight is necessary to get the truth about what is really happening.\"\n \n On March 16, 2011, Chairman Issa wrote a letter to Acting Director Kenneth Melson of the ATF requesting specific documents related to Project Gunrunner, its \"Fast and Furious\" component, and records related to the death of Border Agent Brian Terry. ATF failed to meet the March 30th deadline for producing these documents and furthermore refused to voluntarily commit to any date for producing them.\n \n Media reports have raised questions about the handling of operations involving gun trafficking into Mexico - specifically the allegation that ATF has had a policy of permitting - and even encouraging - the movement of guns into Mexico by straw purchasers. This practice may have contributed to the deaths of hundreds on both sides of the border, including federal law enforcement agents. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA), who has also been pursuing the matter, recently stated, \"I'm still asking questions and we're still getting the runaround from the Justice Department, [t]hey're stonewalling.\"\n \n President Obama recently stated that neither he nor Attorney General Holder authorized this operation. His statement did not specify whether Attorney General Holder was aware of this policy or who did authorize it. The Committee's investigation seeks answers to these questions and the true nature of Project Gunrunner.\n \n Documents subpoenaed and due to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform by April 13, 2011, include:\n \n 1. Documents and communications relating to the genesis of Project Gunrunner and Operation Fast and Furious, and any memoranda or reports involving any changes to either program at or near the time of the release of the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of the Inspector General report about Project Gunrunner in November 2010.\n 2. Documents and communications relating to individuals responsible for authorizing the decision to \"walk\" guns to Mexico in order to follow them and capture a \"bigger fish.\"\n 3. Documents and communications relating to any investigations conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) or any other DOJ component following the fatal shooting of Agent Brian Terry, including information pertaining to two guns found at the crime scene that may have been connected to Project Gunrunner.\n 4. Documents and communications relating to any weapons recovered at the crime scene or during the investigation into the death of Agent Brian Terry.\n 5. Documents and communications between ATF and the Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) who sold weapons to Jaime Avila, including any Report of Investigation (ROI) or other records relating to a December 17, 2009 meeting \"to discuss his role as an FFL during this investigation.\"\n 6. A copy of the presentation, approximately 200 pages long, that the Group 7 Supervisor made to officials at ATF headquarters in the spring of 2010.\n 7. Documents and communications relating to Operation Fast and Furious between and among ATF headquarters and Special Agent in Charge William D. Newell, Assistant Special Agents in Charge Jim Needles and George Gillette, Group Supervisor David Voth, or any Case Agent from November 1, 2009 to the present. The response to this component of the subpoena shall include a memorandum, approximately 30 pages long, from SAC Newell to ATF headquarters following the arrest of Jaime Avila and the death of Agent Brian Terry.\n 8. Documents and communications relating to complaints or objections by ATF agents about<b></b>: (1) encouraging, sanctioning, or otherwise allowing FFLs to sell firearms to known or suspected straw buyers, (2) failure to maintain surveillance on known or suspected straw buyers, (3) failure to maintain operational control over weapons purchased by known or suspected straw buyers, or (4) letting known or suspected straw buyers with American guns enter Mexico.\n\n \n Of course one serious problem with trying to subpoena ATF records is that the ATF operates without putting anything down on documents. They just do as they please with no rhyme or reason.",

You're conveniently absent for a rather long amount of time as multiple members are reporting on the latest scandal to plague the ATF and the only thing you can reply with is a piece of tired old diatribe that you've posted no less than three times previously in the past in response to other discussion threads?\n \n I'm quite disappointed Galileo. I expected a better response from you.\n \n \nIt's interesting that the NRA gets all outraged about the ATF messing up but the NRA has long been a huge obstacle to the ATF doing its job effectively. The NRA loves to give lip service to the idea of enforcing the law and stopping the bad guys but has a history of making it harder for this to happen. The NRA has supported legislation that limits local law enforcement's access to information about gun traffickers in their area.\n\n \n If you have some actual and genuine proof of this statement being anymore true than it was the last time you made the argument then I would love to see it. If you're referring to the Tiahrt Amendment then you're just purporting a bold faced lie about the legislation's intent. The language of said amendment is worded so simply that anyone who reads it will clearly see that it states that only police will have access to gun trace data, and only for official investigation purposes.\n \n If there's evidence to the contrary that you know of then please present it. Make an actual case rather than simple obfuscation and dishonesty.\n \n \nThat would be like having a law that limits the police's knowledge about sex offenders in their area.\n\n \n Are you once again comparing gun owners to sex offenders and other criminals? Besides the various degrees of insulting that you're displaying are you even remotely familiar with the vast differences of these two standards. Gun owners are law abiding citizens who are exercising their constitutional rights. Sex offenders are convicted felons who committed violent and heinous offenses against innocent victims and have proven beyond reasonable doubt that they aren't to be trusted. To suggest that the two standards are somehow comparable defies logic.\n \n \nThe NRA has lobbied Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF, the law enforcement agency that's in charge of stopping straw purchases.\n\n \n And rightfully so considering the most recent incidents involving the ATF. Their own field agents are going on record by name and telling the public that the higher ups told licensed dealers to sell to flagged and suspicious individuals, not just once but hundreds to possibly thousands of times in a relatively short amount of time. You claim the ATF is in charge of stopping straw purchases, and yet they were not only allowing them to take place they were actually encouraging them to be made possible.\n \n Would you like to discuss the continually flip-flop nature of the ATF handing down opinions on the legality of guns and certain accessories? Maybe address the integrity of their position that a shoelace makes a regular rifle into a machine gun? Or how about their opinion that plastic pellet guns are considered true guns, only to immediately reverse their previous decision?\n \n The ATF deserves to have their budget reduced and their existence dissolved. They have no law enforcement integrity whatsoever. They're nothing more than criminals on the government payroll with shiny badges.\n \n \n\"The fate of the Mexican gunrunning rule is only the most recent example of how the gun lobby has consistently outmaneuvered and hemmed in ATF, using political muscle to intimidate lawmakers and erect barriers to tougher gun laws.

If the NRA truly had such influence and political muscle then the ATF wouldn't currently exist in the form that they do now. If the NRA was truly so powerful then not only would the ATF have been dissolved, but the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 would have been repealed long ago.\n \n \npersuading lawmakers to curb ATF's budget and mission and to call agency officials to account at oversight hearings.\n\n \n Are you saying that ATF agents should be exempt from congressional oversight and allowed to operate with impunity?\n \n \nThe source of the NRA's power is its focus on one issue and its ability to get pro-gun candidates elected....\n\n \n Are you suggesting that there's something wrong with a group being single issue oriented in nature? What exact point are you trying to make with this statement Galileo? Are you suggesting that the National Rifle Association should start focusing on matters related to the First or Fifth Amendment? Maybe they should share their opinions regarding copyright laws and intellectual property rights?\n \n \n\"Another reason morale is low, ATF agents say, is the firearms bureau has been without a permanent director since 2006, when Congress required the position to be confirmed by the Senate.

   "It is one thing when criminals and scum bags do criminal acts and supply SOME, I repeat SOME, guns to the Mexican Drug Cartels. That can never be stopped. If you think it can, you are living in a dream world. Ive got one word for you. DRUGS! That is the culprit. \n \n However, it is quite another thing for the ATF to legally push thousands of guns across the border, supplying the Murderous Drug Gangs. \n \n Then there are a few law enforcement and governmental officials that turn criminal and supply guns to them. Combined, that make our Government the biggest supplier of civilian style guns. \n \n OK, some cops and government officials do go bad. That is the right way to see things. However, where is the Anti-gun outrage when it is our government that is the ones who are killing Mexicans and Americans? \n \n They are doing it in our name? emoticon_cry \n \n Not a Flippen Word! Nothing, from any of you! \n \n What prey tell do you think the Mexican People think of us right now! They want some Butts, and I, quite frankly, can't blame them! I want to give them to the Mexican people! Every one of them. That includes all of the Criminal scum bags too!\n \n  Mexican cartels get heavy weapons from Central America, U.S. cables say \n The most fearsome weapons wielded by Mexico's drug cartels enter the country from Central America, not the United States, according to U.S. diplomatic cables disseminated by WikiLeaks and published here Tuesday by La Jornada newspaper. Items such as grenades and rocket-launchers are stolen from Central American armies and smuggled into Mexico via neighboring Guatemala, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City reported to Washington.\n \n \n  The 'America is arming Mexico's drug gangs' lie \n \"There is an iron river of guns that flows South into Mexico [from the United States] to supply criminal organizations on the border,\" says Tom Mangan, senior special agent with Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) in Phoenix. \"They are in the market for machine guns, hand grenades, rocket propelled grenade launchers and Stinger anti aircraft missiles,\" he continues. That's right. The drug gangs can't buy that and other military stuff like the 40MM grenades (the silver things in the upper left) and the rifles with launchers shown in the photo below in Mexico, so they drive to the United States and purchase them from American gun dealers at retail. Isn't that the story you've been told? Well, congratulations. America's First Amendment protected propaganda ministry has punked you on another important issue -- this time on behalf of dissembling officials and gun confiscation advocates. \n\n \n \n  Is it gun shops, gun shows or government that is &#8216;chief source of weapons?' \n Yesterday, a federal grand jury indicted Mayor Eddie Espinoza, Police Chief Angelo Vega, Trustee Blas Gutierrez, all of Columbus, NM, and eight others including Gutierrez&#8217; wife, Eva on charges of gun trafficking. Court documents obtained by this column allege that approximately 200 firearms were purchased by the suspects over a 14-month period, running from January 2010 to this month, and that several of those firearms have been recovered by authorities in Mexico. Authorities in that country are \"distancing themselves\" from the growing scandal over gun trafficking, as reported by the McAllen, TX Monitor\n \n To keep this in perspective, that pales in comparison to perhaps 2,500 guns allegedly allowed to enter the illicit gun trade under the Project Gunrunner/Fast-and-Furious operation in Arizona, an operation that has become the center of a scandal now under investigation by Iowa Sen. \n \n Still, the press seems content to focus on the myth of &#8220;American guns flooding Mexico&#8221; rather than the facts about how a lot of them apparently got there. \n\n But instead, you want to lay all of this at the feet of the American Gun owner, so you can take away our Rights.",

   "ATF knew risks in border operation - Washington Times\n \n \nSen. Chuck Grassley, investigating whether an undercover federal operation contributed to the slaying of a U.S. Border Patrol agent, said Thursday the ATF instructed an Arizona gun dealer to engage in \"suspicious sales\" despite the dealer's concerns that the weapons could \"end up south of the border.\"\n \n In a letter this week to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., the Iowa senator described as \"untrue\" personal assurances the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives gave to the gun dealer in an email saying \"safeguards were in place\" to prevent further distribution of the numerous weapons sold, including AK-47 assault rifles.\n \n Mr. Grassley, ranking Republican on the SenateJudiciary Committee, said emails between ATF officials and a federal firearms licensee in Arizona obtained by his staff show that the dealer took his concerns directly to the agency and later met with the U.S. attorney's office to discuss the matter, but was told to continue the sales. One email, Mr. Grassley said, was sent six months before two AK-47s sold by the dealer were found at the scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian A. Terry's killing.\n \n In a speech Thursday on the Senate floor, Mr. Grassley said the ATF was supposed to stop criminals from trafficking guns to Mexican drug cartels but actually had made the process \"easier.\" He said the government \"actually encouraged gun dealers to sell multiple firearms to known and suspected traffickers.\"\n \n Mr. Holder has asked the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General to investigate the matter and, according to spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler, \"has made clear to law enforcement agencies and prosecutors working along the [southwest] border that no one should allow guns to illegally cross.\"\n \n In recent congressional testimony, Mr. Holder said questions raised by ATF agents about the way operations have been conducted have to be \"taken seriously.\"\n \n \"We continue to work with our law enforcement counterparts here and in Mexico to stem the flow of weapons, cash and drugs across our borders and interdict people whose only goal is to evade law enforcement,\" Ms. Schmaler said. \"Fighting criminal activity along the southwest border - including the illegal trafficking of guns to Mexico - has been a priority of this administration and this Department of Justice.\"\n \n Mr. Terry, 40, was shot Dec. 14 during a gunfight 10 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border while attempting to arrest Mexican bandits who prey on illegal aliens. He was waiting with three other Border Patrol agents in a remote area when the gunbattle erupted. None of the other agents was injured. Mr. Terry died the next day in a hospital.\n \n Mr. Grassley said ATF agents also had expressed to him their concerns that the agency, as part of \"Project Gunrunner,\" had allowed guns to \"walk\" across the border despite warnings that someone could get killed.\n \n One agent who has claimed whistle-blower status is George Gillett Jr., assistant special agent in charge of the ATF's Phoenix field office. He oversaw the Gunrunner operation and its \"Fast and Furious\" component, a sting that funneled more than 1,700 smuggled weapons from Arizona to Mexico. He has not been available for comment.\n \n According to Mr. Grassley, ATF supervisor David Voth told the Arizona gun dealer in an April 2010 email he understood his concerns considering the \"frequency with which some individuals under investigation by our office have been purchasing firearms from your business.\" But he said ATF was \"continually monitoring these suspects using a variety of investigative techniques which I cannot go into [in] detail.\"\n \n Following that email, he said the ATF arranged a May 2010 meeting between the dealer and the U.S. attorney's office, during which Mr. Grassley said prosecutors \"assured the gun dealer in even stronger terms that there were safeguards in place to prevent further distribution of the weapons after being purchased from his business.\"\n \n \"As we now know, those assurances proved to be untrue,\" Mr. Grassley said in the letter.\n \n In June 2010, he said the dealer again expressed concern, saying he \"wanted to make sure\" that none of the firearms he sold at the ATF's direction \"could or would ever end up south of the border or in the hands of the bad guys. ...

Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a letter with the new emails to Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr.\n \n The Justice Department in its only official response to the congressional inquiry denied that the ATF \"sanctioned\" or \"otherwise knowingly allowed\" the sale of assault weapons to straw purchasers, who then transported them to Mexico.\n \n The new emails suggest that the Arizona gun dealer was seeking assurances from the ATF and the U.S. attorney's office that the company would not be held responsible if someone got hurt with guns that ended up in the hands of gunrunners.\n \n Voth, the ATF agent, wrote to the dealer: \"I understand that the frequency with which some individuals under investigation by our office have been purchasing firearms from your business has caused concerns for you. ... However, if it helps put you at ease we (ATF) are continually monitoring these suspects using a variety of investigative techniques which I cannot go into [in] detail.\"\n \n News reports in June 2010 that guns purchased in the U.S. were being found at Mexican crime scenes prompted the dealer to again express concerns.\n \n \"I shared my concerns with you guys that I wanted to make sure that none of the firearms that were sold per our conversation with you and various ATF agents could or would ever end up south of the border or in the hands of the bad guys,\" the dealer wrote, adding that the reports are \"disturbing.\"\n \n On \"one or two\" occasions when the dealer's employees videotaped a suspected straw purchaser exchanging money with another person, the ATF urged that the sale go forward, but the employees refused, Grassley said in his letter.\n \n \"In light of this new evidence, the Justice Department's claim that the ATF never knowingly sanctioned or allowed the sale of assault weapons to straw purchasers is simply not credible,\" Grassley wrote.\n \n Thousands of guns were sold to straw purchasers under Project Gunrunner. The ATF has acknowledged that at least 195 U.S. firearms sold to suspected straw purchasers have been recovered in Mexico, but agents have said thousands slipped outside ATF oversight.\n",

   "4/20/11\n \n   New DNC chief reaffirms hers is &#8216;the party of gun control&#8217; \n Under that program, the U.S. State Department requires private companies in the United States to obtain an export license in order to sell defense hardware or services to foreign purchasers &#8212; which include both government units and private buyers in other countries. These arms deals are known as Direct Commercial Sales (DCS). Each year, the State Department issues a report tallying the volume and dollar amount of DCS items approved for export and shipped &#8212; with the most recent report covering fiscal 2009.\n \n Narco News reported in March 2009 that the deadliest of the weapons now in the hands of criminal groups in Mexico, particularly along the U.S. border, by any reasonable standard of an analysis of the facts, appear to be getting into that nation through perfectly legal private-sector arms exports authorized under programs such as DCS.\n \n Between 2005 and 2009, nearly $60 billion worth of U.S. defense articles were exported globally by U.S. private companies via the DCS program, according to a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report.\n \n In addition to the $177 million in defense hardware shipped by private U.S. companies to Mexico in fiscal 2009, some $204 million in arms were shipped to Mexico in fiscal year 2008, according to DCS data compiled by the State Department. Now, war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan dwarfed Mexico in terms of DCS arms shipments in fiscal 2008, with a total of $3.8 billion collectively, but in terms of actual DCS arms shipments in fiscal 2009, according to the State Department data, Mexico beat out both of them &#8212; as private-sector arms shipments to Iraq and Afghanistan fell off sharply. \n\n \n   Legal U.S. Arms Exports May Be Source of Narco Syndicates Rising Firepower --- More Than $1 billion In Private-Sector Weapons Exports Approved For Mexico Since 2004 \n Mainstream media and Beltway pundits and politicians in recent months have unleashed a wave of panic in the nation linking the escalading violence in Mexico, and its projected spread into the U.S., to illegal weapons smuggling.\n \n The smokescreen being spread by these official mouthpieces of manufactured consensus is that a host of criminal operators are engaging in straw (or fraudulent) gun purchases, making clandestine purchases at U.S. gun shows or otherwise assembling small caches of weapons here in the states in order to smuggle them south of the border to the &#8220;drug cartels.&#8221;\n \n To be sure, some criminal actors in the U.S. are smuggling small arms across the border. But the drug war in Mexico is not being fought with Saturday night specials, hobby rifles and hunting shotguns. The drug trafficking organizations are now in possession of high-powered munitions in vast quantities that can&#8217;t be explained by the gun-show loophole.\n \n A Narco News investigation into the flow of arms across the U.S. border appears to lead right back to the systemic corruption that afflicts a vast swath of the Mexican government under President Felipe Calderon and this nation&#8217;s own embrace of market-driven free-trade policies.\n \n The deadliest of the weapons now in the hands of criminal groups in Mexico, particularly along the U.S. border, by any reasonable standard of an analysis of the facts, appear to be getting into that nation through perfectly legal private-sector arms exports, measured in the billions of dollars, and sanctioned by our own State Department. These deadly trade commodities &#8212; grenade launchers, explosives and &#8220;assault&#8221; weapons &#8212;are then, in quantities that can fill warehouses, being corruptly transferred to drug trafficking organizations via their reach into the Mexican military and law enforcement agencies, the evidence indicates.\n",

   "  GUNRUNNER: The 'blame Bush' option is out \n ....\n AS CBS News reported Tuesday, the strategy of \"letting guns walk\" out of Southwest gun shops began in late 2009. The Bush administration left in January 2009. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had been conducting \"Gunrunner\" activities on a limited basis prior to that, but the operation was dramatically expanded months after Obama administration officials, most notably Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, had been discussing the number of U.S.-origin guns being recovered at Mexican narco-war crime scenes.\n \n \n ATF insiders being interviewed in Arizona are among those who told CBS News that their own agency employed a controversial strategy beginning in late 2009 called \"letting guns walk,\" to try to gather intelligence.-CBS News\n\n \n There is a growing suspicion within the firearms community that ATF higher-ups wanted to flood Mexico with guns, just to boost their statistics on recovered guns, and thus justify demands for renewal and expansion of the ban on so-called \"assault weapons.\" Such a ban would also be permanent.\n\n \n Humm. Then I say, welcome to the party then! There is no doubt in my mind! emoticon_smile\n \n   Amid Probe Of 'Project Gunrunner,' Obama Seeks Comments On ATF's Anti-Gun Trafficking Rule\n  \n As House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) probes Project Gunrunner -- the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) effort aimed at combating gun trafficking on the Mexican border that went awry -- the Obama administration is seeking another round of comments on a controversial proposal to make gun dealers in four border states report sales of multiple rifles.\n \n The proposal was previously published in the Federal Register in December and garnered nearly 13,000 responses in 60 days, according to Reuters. Around 30 percent of the comments were in opposition to the rule while 70 percent were in favor, according to ATF.\n \n Meanwhile, congressional investigators are on the ground in Arizona as part of the investigation into how ATF officials involved with Project Gunrunner allowed guns to \"walk\" across the Mexican border.

Tens of thousands of firearms and explosives are sold legally through the U.S. State Department to the Mexican government.

   "  Firearms Industry Responds to Mexico's Threats of Litigation\n  \n The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the trade association for the firearms industry, respects the work of President Calderon to willingly take on his country's powerful drug cartels; however, we are disappointed that he would seek to hold law-abiding American companies responsible for crime in Mexico. This is especially troubling given investigative reports that show more than 80 percent of the firearms recovered in Mexico do not come from the United States. The most recent of these reports, from the independent research group STRATFOR, determined that less than 12 percent of the guns Mexico seized in 2008 came from the United States.\n \n Furthermore, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), firearms traced in Mexico were originally sold at retail not recently, but, on average, 14 years earlier. This is completely inconsistent with any notion that a flood of newly purchased firearms are being illegally smuggled over the border. And let's not forget that no retail firearm sale can be made in the U.S. until after an FBI criminal background check of the purchaser has been completed.\n \n Still, in response to concerns over the violence in Mexico, ATF conducted more than 2,000 inspections of firearms dealers along the border. The result? Not a single dealer was charged with committing any crime and only two (or 0.01%) had their licenses revoked for unknown reasons that could have nothing to do with the cartels illegally obtaining firearms from retailers in the United States.\n \n While these ATF inspections were clearing the law-abiding retailers' good names, which were being smeared by many in the mainstream press and anti-gun officials in both the United States and Mexico, as many as 150,000 Mexican soldiers defected to work for the drug cartels, bringing their American-made service-issued firearms with them.\n\n Ooooooo K then!",

   "Well Sinjin I see you successfully changed the direction of conversion and taken it in a new direction in order to take the heat off the fact the ATF is the biggest gun runner of Civilian firearms. \n \n Note the words, \"Originated in the U.S.\" Our U.S. Army M 60 Machine guns, M 16's with grenade launchers, m 40 grenades, were given by our government to South American and other Governments did in fact, ORIGINATE in the U.S., but were later smuggled into Mexico through corruption. It could be said in that contexts and still be true. emoticon_smile\n \n   Narcotics traffickers are acquiring firepower more appropriate to an army -- including grenade launchers and antitank rockets -- and the police are feeling outgunned \n The Feb. 21 attack on police headquarters in coastal Zihuatanejo, which injured four people, fit a disturbing trend of Mexico's drug wars. Traffickers have escalated their arms race, acquiring military-grade weapons, including hand grenades, grenade launchers, armor-piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals.\n \n Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea, eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto- matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.\n\n I remind everyone that Senator John Kerry was the first person to let the 90% LIE out of the bag. \n   Kerry in solidarity with Mexico in drug fight \n Ninety percent of the weapons seized from the cartels and traced by ATF originated in the United States. \n \n What is less common, however, is the cooperation that occurred in this case. Only about one out of every four weapons seized by Mexican authorities last year was submitted to the ATF so they could be traced back to purchasers and sellers in the United States..\n \n \n   Mexico: U.S. Must Stop Gun Trade At Border \n President Calderon told AP. \"Let me express to you that we've seized in this two years more than 25,000 weapons and guns, and more than 90 percent of them came from United States, and I'm talking from missiles launchers to machine guns and grenades.\"\n\n Missiles launchers to machine guns and grenades?

   "=sinjin;429070]The number of guns taken from the cartels is well over 100,000 and counting.\n\n \n Uh, yeah! That is the point being made and the point is that the ATF has been purchasing guns with the approval of higher ups probably all the way to the top of the chain. Apparently they did this using their alias LEO names or by providing for cartel members to purchase guns themselves and ok the purchase at American stores. The sad fact is that many were provided that are NOT AVAILABLE ON THE CIVILIAN MARKET and included military weapons through bureau purchases and military sales gov't to gov't from our gov't to Mexico which has been going on for some time. Where did you get the 100,000 figure from? Is that the recorded stat kept by ATF of the number they let \"walk\" or 'fast and furious' into Mexico?\n \n \nThe vast majority are makes and models readily available on the US civilian market.\n \n \n What is so unusual that a civil right, incorporated in the XIVth Amendment, is available to the citizens of the United States? The crime is that ATF has been intentionally smuggling guns to the cartels to try to influence that right and free exercise by Americans by illegally giving or selling those guns to a foreign country which has in the past been at war with the U.S.? \n \n That crime was a cheap attempt to demean a legitimate right and is a form of gov't sponsored terrorism and tyranny. To defend it is not only unpatriotic, It is against the rule of law and a Constitutional crime. I am not surprised at your defense of these UNCONSTITUTIONAL acts and the intention of the ATF and the Administration who currently are trying to hide all the bodies involved.\n \n Your weak attempt to lay the blame at the feet of the American gun owners instead of the ATF and Administration was their goal all along but they got caught by patriotic minded members of that .org who had a hand in exposing it. Criminal enterprises are rife with people like you and these folks you so adamantly try to defend and cover up for. You are nothing but an enabler, a perp enabler.\n \n I do not think highly of a gov't agency that shoots nursing mothers at less than 97 yards (the longest recorded shot by the FBI, HRT) with a high powered scope through a clean window. Maybe your hate will allow you to dismiss this and the 86 mostly women and children killed by shooting or flames at Waco? Your immorality proceeds you.",

   "  House Panel Releases Scathing Report on 'Fast and Furious' Gun Operation, Sure to Anger Mexico  \n Agents say the man in charge of the operation in Phoenix, \"was jovial, if not giddy\" when Fast and Furious guns were found in Mexico. One agent described in detail his disgust at the self-satisfaction of ATF leadership for sending guns into what they knew to be a war zone, saying, \"I cannot see anyone who has one iota of concern for human life being OK with this.\" \n (That large part is for Galileo who said)\nWhere do you stand? Do you fight tooth and nail against every law that could reduce gun trafficking and save lives, but hypocritically heap criticism on the BATFE for allowing a few guns to be trafficked?\n\n \n In a question-and-answer session with congressional investigators, he was asked, \"So is it a fair, predictable outcome of the policy that there would be essentially collateral damage in terms of human lives?\"\n \n \"Sure,\" the agent replied, \"That's correct.\"\n \n Both line agents and gun dealers repeatedly warned supervisors the guns would end up killing people, the report says, \"but ATF supervisors told agents to follow orders because this was sanctioned from above. They told gun dealers not to worry because they would make sure the guns didn't fall into the wrong hands.\" \n\n But of course, you antis will somehow want to pin this all on us, and or say this is gun owners fault! Or perhaps, in a few years, say that this was the result of these gun dealers greed and irresponsibility, instead of being the fault of our government.\n \n Come on! Belly up to the bar and take responsibility for the carnage that was caused in We the People of the United States of America's name. That and the American people's drug habbits.\n \n Now imagine a border that was secure enough to stop drugs and or guns from passing in either direction.

   "  Senator Chuck Grassley demolishes the &#8216;river of guns&#8217; myth \n Some points by Senator Grassley:\n \n ATF trace data proves that the majority of firearms did not come from American gun stores: &#8220;of those firearms actually submitted for tracing, a vast majority of those firearms did not come from FFLs &#8230;&#8221; Instead, American-made firearms were sold to &#8220;foreign countries or militaries requiring approval of the State Department and Homeland Security.&#8221;\n \n The &#8220;70% of cartel guns are American&#8221; allegation includes &#8220;nearly 2,000 firearms as part of ATF&#8217;s Fast and Furious Investigation, where the ATF knowingly authorized firearm sales to straw purchasers before the weapons were trafficked to Mexican DTOs [Drug Trafficking Organizations].&#8221;\n \n Said Grassley: &#8220;I understand that agents working on tracing weapons in Mexico back to the U.S. routinely instruct GOM [Government of Mexico] authorities to only submit weapons for tracing that have a likelihood of tracing back to the U.S.&#8221; Building on the sampling bias I noted earlier, this implies that the American and Mexican governments intentionally conspired to manufacture a crisis.\n \n One last coffin nail by Grassley: &#8220;Data indicates that the top source dealer for illegal firearms traced in Mexico for 2009 was &#8220;Direccion General De Industria Milita&#8221; or the Directorate General of Military Industry in Mexico.&#8221;\n \n \n   Fox News accounts that some officials in Mexico would like to extradite and prosecute U.S. officials responsible for Operation Fast and Furious because it flooded their country with guns illegally, resulting in the deaths of possibly hundreds of Mexican citizens.\n \n I can&#8217;t say that I blame them. This in NOT something the field agents cooked up. \n \n This is just my opinion, but, looking at the circumstances, I think this is a Justice Department attempt to make the case for, and try to get, more gun control. If this is correct, and looking at all of the lies that were told to the American people about the numbers, I can&#8217;t say that I blame the Mexican government and people for wanting some butts. \n \n This is not our finest hour, and this is not what the American people, nor what our LEO's, are about!\n \n Some excerpts from\n   The Department of Justice&#8217;s Operation Fast and Furious:\n Accounts of ATF Agents \n \"While leadership at ATF and DOJ no doubt regard these deaths as tragic, the deaths were a clearly foreseeable result of the strategy. Both line agents and gun dealers who cooperated with the ATF repeatedly expressed concerns about that risk, but ATF supervisors did not heed those warnings. Instead, they told agents to follow orders because this was sanctioned from above. They told gun dealers not to worry because they would make sure the guns didn&#8217;t fall into the wrong hands.\"\n \n A whistleblower agent: \"When we hit the ground in Phoenix, say, and the original 40 straw purchasers were identified, and I can&#8217;t remember if it is 240 or 270 guns that they knew at that point that these guys were responsible for ... we should have landed on every one of those people the minute that we hit here. And the ones that we landed on that we couldn&#8217;t make cases on, at least they would have been on notice that we were watching and they would have stopped buying, or every time they did, the flag went up and we could have been on them then.\n \n And of all the ones that we didn&#8217;t land on, several of them would have spoken to us, a couple of them even maybe would have worked for us as a confidential informant or sources, which is how you climb the ladder in an investigation into an organization.\"\n \n Another agent: \"I cannot see anyone who has one iota of concern for human life being okay with this...\"\n \n An agent so frustrated at being told NOT to stop a straw buyer's car full of guns that his radio response made other agents think he was in distress and needed help. The buyer had spotted that he was being tailed and there was no longer any reason to hold off and let him get away. \"there is a verbal screaming match over the radio about how . . . what are you talking about? There is no better time or reason to pull this guy over than right now.\"\n Agent describes a supervisor: \"Whenever he would get a trace report back . . . he was jovial, if not, not giddy, but just delighted about that, hey, 20 of our guns were recovered with 350 pounds of dope in Mexico last night. And it was exciting.\" Supervisors saying, if want an omelette, you have to break some eggs.\n \n A DoJ letter: \"At the outset, the allegation described in your January 27 letter &#8211; that ATF &#8220;sanctioned&#8221; or otherwise knowingly allowed the sale of assault weapons to a straw purchaser who then transported them into Mexico &#8211; is false.\" Another: \"It remains our understanding that ATF&#8217;s Operation Fast and Furious did not knowingly permit straw buyers to take guns into Mexico.\"\n",

It is a childish tactic and not conductive of honest and legitimate debate, not is it something used by someone who is interested in a constructive discussion to get to the truth.\n \n However your article points to quite an interesting divide when it comes to the gun control movement. When Adam Gadahn released his video urging terrorists in America to exploit the supposedly weak gun control laws of the nation to obtain machine guns from gun stores without background checks or ID (despite the legitimacy of his claims) supporters of gun control were quick to jump on board and point to this video as reason for trying to change the laws in a drastic fashion. Yet in this interview we have Rejon stating that the American government would sell guns directly to the cartels of Mexico, and gun control supporters have been quite moot on the point.\n \n I also find it interesting that Rejon's history of lying was ever brought up to begin with. For what purpose was this made an issue when Adam Gadahn was not accused of fear mongering and bolstering?",

   "Humm. I have an idea. Maybe you can provide us with a letter from Director Melson denying these facts or calling them into question, or even saying darn it, or something similar. That would bolster your clam of foul play by an esteemed U.S. and long sitting Senator. \n \n Otherwise I call into question and ask you to prove everything Galileo has ever said. emoticon_smile That would be fair. No? \n \n Oooooor would you want me to prove it was false? Thought so. emoticon_smile\n \n However, if you are calling into question the Senator's character, or calling the Senator a liar, you produce the proof.\n \n The Senator's letter to the ATF chief.\n   Grassley Disputes Firearms Figures from the ATF \nDear Acting Director Melson:\n \n ..... First and foremost, it is worth noting that the firearms data discussed in the article is based upon only the firearms that were submitted by the GOM to ATF for tracing. According to a May 6, 2009, article written by the Associated Press, over 305,424 confiscated weapons are locked in vaults in Mexico.[1] The weapons submitted for tracing represent only a small percentage of the number of weapons found to be part of the DTO related crime in Mexico. Further, there has been significant evidence in the media recently regarding the proliferation of weapons in Mexico smuggled out of Central America. For example, at a recent hearing before the Caucus on Central American security cooperation we heard testimony from witnesses that corrupt officers with access to unsecured arsenals in Guatemala and Honduras were an important source of weapons. In one recent media report, they discussed how over 1,100 fragmentation grenades, M-60 machine guns, and over a dozen grenade launchers were recovered in Guatemala at an alleged safe house of the Zetas DTO. That same article added that the Zetas had stolen over 500 weapons from a Guatemalan military base between 2007 and 2008. \n \n .....Looking specifically at the information provided by the ATF to Senator Feinstein and the The Wall Street Journal raises some questions when compared more detailed data provided to my office. ATF actually traced 26,813 firearms in 2009 and 9,443 in 2010. Further, that data indicates that of those firearms actually submitted for tracing, a vast majority of those firearms did not come from FFLs (either U.S. based or Mexican based). In fact, of the 26,813 weapons traced in 2009, only 5,800 actually traced back to U.S. or Mexican FFLs. Table 1 illustrates a more detailed breakdown of the firearms data for both 2009 and 2010. The most noteworthy portion of the information is that nearly 78% of firearms traced in 2009 and 66% of firearms traced in 2010 were assigned to a catchall category &#8220;No Final Sale Dealer&#8221; which means the firearms did not trace back to a United States FFL. This category of firearms includes firearms that have no nexus with U.S. commerce. It also includes firearms where the only nexus to U.S. commerce is that they were manufactured by U.S. companies. This means they are not sold by FFLs in the United States. Instead, they may be sold to foreign countries or militaries requiring approval of the State Department and Homeland Security. Additionally, this category includes firearms in the ATF&#8217;s Suspect Gun Database&#8212;a category which would include nearly 2,000 firearms as part of ATF&#8217;s Fast and Furious Investigation where the ATF knowingly authorized firearm sales to straw purchasers before the weapons were trafficked to Mexican DTOs.\n",

As the Co-Chairman of the Caucus, and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary (&#8220;Committee&#8221;), I have been investigating serious allegations raised by whistleblowers within the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) that agents knowingly allowed weapons to be sold to straw purchasers who then transferred those weapons to Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations (&#8220;DTOs&#8221;). These allegations were the subject of two Congressional hearings this week and the timing of the release of this information raises questions about why the ATF would choose to release this information publicly now. Further, after reviewing the data presented in the article, I have questions about why ATF provided some select information, but not a more detailed analysis that would help Congress, and the American people, better understand the causes and sources of illegal firearms in Mexico. \n \n \n Federal law prohibits the ATF from releasing firearm trace data or multiple handgun sales reports, but it does not prohibit the release of aggregate statistical data on illegal gun trafficking. However, I am concerned that the selective release of certain statistical data without further clarification and categorization may inaccurately reflect the scope and source of the problem of firearms in Mexico and the DTO violence. For example, the article states that ATF traced firearms in Mexico that were submitted for tracing by the Government of Mexico (&#8220;GOM&#8221;) 21,313 firearms in 2009 and 7,971 firearms in 2010. The article further adds that of the firearms traced, 14,213 in 2009 were manufactured in the U.S. or imported to the U.S. from other countries. The article adds that 6,291 firearms in 2010 were either manufactured in the U.S. or imported from other countries. Taken together, these numbers provided the basis for the general estimate that 70% of firearms provided to the ATF from the GOM were traced back to the U.S.\n \n \n The implication the article makes is that these firearms must come directly from U.S. manufacturers or U.S. Federal Firearms Licensees (&#8220;FFLs&#8221;) selling guns to DTO members who smuggle the guns over the Southwest border. Unfortunately, this information paints a grossly inaccurate picture of the situation. \n \n \n First and foremost, it is worth noting that the firearms data discussed in the article is based upon only the firearms that were submitted by the GOM to ATF for tracing. According to a May 6, 2009, article written by the Associated Press, over 305,424 confiscated weapons are locked in vaults in Mexico.[1] The weapons submitted for tracing represent only a small percentage of the number of weapons found to be part of the DTO related crime in Mexico. Further, there has been significant evidence in the media recently regarding the proliferation of weapons in Mexico smuggled out of Central America. For example, at a recent hearing before the Caucus on Central American security cooperation we heard testimony from witnesses that corrupt officers with access to unsecured arsenals in Guatemala and Honduras were an important source of weapons. In one recent media report, they discussed how over 1,100 fragmentation grenades, M-60 machine guns, and over a dozen grenade launchers were recovered in Guatemala at an alleged safe house of the Zetas DTO. That same article added that the Zetas had stolen over 500 weapons from a Guatemalan military base between 2007 and 2008. \n \n \n Additional evidence regarding the source of weapons in Mexico is contained in an unclassified cable from the U.S. Department of State (&#8220;DOS&#8221;) dated July 2, 2010, obtained by my office and attached to this letter. The cable, titled, &#8220;Mexico Weapons Trafficking &#8211; The Blame Game&#8221; seeks to dispel rumors about the source of weapons trafficked to Mexico. The unclassified cable includes sections such as: &#8220;Myth: An Iron Highway of Weapons Flows from the U.S.,&#8221; &#8220;Myth: The DTOs Are Mostly Responsible,&#8221; &#8220;Myth: Mexico Aggressively Investigating Weapons Confiscated,&#8221; &#8220;Myth: Mexico Methodically Registers and Tracks Weapons,&#8221; and &#8220;Myth: The GOM Justice System is Tough on Violators of Gun Laws.&#8221; While this cable is very candid about the true problem of weapons smuggling inside Mexico, the cover emails forwarding this cable suggest that the ATF and officials associated with the ATF disagreed. \n \n \n In fact, one email written by Special Agent in Charge William Newell states, &#8220;I could go on and on but once our &#8216;Fast and Furious&#8217; case breaks it will change this.&#8221; Unfortunately, it now appears that Special Agent in Charge Newell&#8217;s prediction was correct, but instead of an &#8220;Iron Highway&#8221; operating on its own, it was ATF who fueled the flow of weapons through its &#8220;Fast and Furious&#8221; investigation which knowingly sanctioned the sale of nearly 2,000 firearms to straw purchasers. \n \n \n I understand that agents working on tracing weapons in Mexico back to the U.S. routinely instruct GOM authorities to only submit weapons for tracing that have a likelihood of tracing back to the U.S. The purpose of this policy is to direct resources to tracing firearms that may have a U.S. nexus, instead of simply wasting resources on tracing firearms that will not trigger a U.S. source. So, based upon this background information, it is not surprising that reviewing a sample of weapons that is purposefully directed to increase the likelihood of U.S. generated weapons would in fact skew toward the direction of making it look like U.S. gun dealers provide more weapons than they actually do.. However, further discussion of the data that is presented in the article is warranted. \n \n \n Looking specifically at the information provided by the ATF to Senator Feinstein and the The Wall Street Journal raises some questions when compared more detailed data provided to my office. ATF actually traced 26,813 firearms in 2009 and 9,443 in 2010. Further, that data indicates that of those firearms actually submitted for tracing, a vast majority of those firearms did not come from FFLs (either U.S. based or Mexican based). In fact, of the 26,813 weapons traced in 2009, only 5,800 actually traced back to U.S. or Mexican FFLs. Table 1 illustrates a more detailed breakdown of the firearms data for both 2009 and 2010. The most noteworthy portion of the information is that nearly 78% of firearms traced in 2009 and 66% of firearms traced in 2010 were assigned to a catchall category &#8220;No Final Sale Dealer&#8221; which means the firearms did not trace back to a United States FFL. This category of firearms includes firearms that have no nexus with U.S. commerce. It also includes firearms where the only nexus to U.S. commerce is that they were manufactured by U.S. companies. This means they are not sold by FFLs in the United States. Instead, they may be sold to foreign countries or militaries requiring approval of the State Department and Homeland Security. Additionally, this category includes firearms in the ATF&#8217;s Suspect Gun Database&#8212;a category which would include nearly 2,000 firearms as part of ATF&#8217;s Fast and Furious Investigation where the ATF knowingly authorized firearm sales to straw purchasers before the weapons were trafficked to Mexican DTOs.\n \n \n Table 1: Firearms Tracing Information for 2009 and 2010\n \n Year\n Number of Firearms Submitted for Tracing by Government of Mexico\n Number of Firearms Traced to Federal Firearm Licensees (FFLs)\n Number of Firearms Assigned to &#8220;No Final Sale Dealer&#8221;\n \n 2009\n 26,813\n 5,800 (22%)\n 21,013 (78%)\n \n 2010\n 9,443\n 3,176 (34%)\n 6,267 (66%)\n \n \n Because the numbers provided to my office indicate that the data provided to Senator Feinstein and The Wall Street Journal may not be entirely accurate and because further questions and breakdowns of that data are necessary for Congress to make an informed decision about the sources of weapons that are fueling the DTO related violence in Mexico, I ask that you provide responses to the following questions:\n \n \n (1) Of the 21,013 firearms in the &#8220;No Final Sale Dealer&#8221; category for 2009, how many of those firearms can be traced back to military sales to the GOM? How many can be traced to the military of Guatemala? How many can be traced to the military of Honduras? How many can be traced to the military of El Salvador? How many can be traced to other Central American and South American militaries? How many can be traced to other foreign militaries? How many are in that category because they were in the Suspect Gun Database?\n \n (2) Of the 6,267 firearms in the &#8220;No Final Sale Dealer&#8221; category for 2010, how many of those firearms can be traced back to military sale to the GOM? How many can be traced to the military of Guatemala? How many can be traced to the military of Honduras? How many can be traced to the military of El Salvador? How many can be traced to other Central American and South American militaries? How many can be traced to other foreign militaries? How many are in that category because they were in the Suspect Gun Database?\n \n (3) How many of those weapons in the &#8220;No Final Sale Dealer&#8221; category for 2009 and 2010 were previously reported lost or stolen? \n \n (4) Has the ATF requested access to the 305,424 firearms held by the GOM military vault? How many of those firearms have been traced? How many of those firearms would trace back to the GOM and the Mexican military? \n \n (5) Data indicates that the top source dealer for illegal firearms traced in Mexico for 2009 was &#8220;Direccion General De Industria Milita&#8221; or the Directorate General of Military Industry in Mexico. They provided 120 firearms that were later traced back, likely after a crime. Why does this entity have a U.S. Federal Firearms License? Are sales to this and other foreign entities with U.S. FFL&#8217;s included in the numbers the ATF provided as being a gun from a &#8220;U.S. Source&#8221;. If so, why? \n \n (6) Why did the number of trace requests drop significantly from 2009 to 2010, but the percentage trace to U.S. FFLs go up? What is behind this trend? \n \n \n Accordingly, as Co-Chairman of the Caucus and Ranking Member of the Committee, I request your prompt response to these important questions no later than June 23, 2011. \n \n \n Sincerely,\n \n \n Charles E.

   "No schemes account for the 100,000+ weapons recovered to date. That's why.\n \n The real deflection is the focus being put on bad decisions made by a few in the ATF that account for a small percentage of the total.\n\n \n Firstly the number of weapons recovered from Mexico seems irrelevant. Under federal law the citizens of Mexico are prohibited from buying guns in the United States, and the laws in Mexico prevent the ownership of such weapons by private citizens or subjects. Under either measure of laws these weapons were acquired illegally. I assume that would make them count as stolen property that has been recovered by the police. If the guns in Mexico do qualify as stolen property that has been recovered then that would mean some part of America technically qualifies as a victim of grand theft.\n \n As to the bad decision by a few in the ATF, the investigation is still underway to determine just who was involved, who knew about the operation, who drew up the operation, who ordered the operation carried out, who gave the operation the green light in the first place, why there is still ongoing obstruction into the investigation, and why that obstruction is coming from the Justice Department itself.\n \n We have here what is shaping up to be a case where the law makers and the law enforcers have become the law breakers. those in charge and expected to guard have literally become the violators they claim to protect against. The focus needs to be on who is responsible for the operation itself, more so than anything else. If this is truly a case of criminal actions by the government then we need to be considering what legal avenues we have. Who can be held accountable, who can be punished, and how can they be punished?\n \n We should be looking for ways to use measures such as the Patriot Act against the government itself, not making suggestions that will only make big government even bigger.",

   "Stunning new 'Gunwalker' allegations expose massive scale of scandal - St. Louis gun rights | Examiner.com\n \n \nMore dramatically, Melson revealed that not only were other federal agencies (including, but perhaps not limited to, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, and U.S. Attorney's Office) heavily involved with the people the BATFE was supposedly trying to \"bust,\" but that in some cases, the \"walked\" guns were bought with American tax dollars:\n \n \n The evidence we have gathered raises the disturbing possibility that the Justice Department not only allowed criminals to smuggle weapons but that taxpayer dollars from other agencies may have financed those engaging in such activities.\n \n Fox News puts it more bluntly, quoting sources that claim that the BATFE's top target was himself a paid FBI informant:\n \n \n In a separate development, congressional sources have learned that not only was U.S. taxpayer money being used to buy guns that were later sent to Mexico, but the main target of the investigation was actually a FBI informant and former drug dealer who had been deported years ago.\n \n That Fox article has accompanying video. Watch both it, and the video in the sidebar, in which Congressman Issa discusses these new developments with Fox.\n \n And we still haven't gotten to yesterday evening's blockbuster. A source of David Codrea's and Mike Vanderboegh's, whose history of accurate tips has given them reason for confidence in his allegations, claims that another \"Project Gunwalker\" has been run out of the BATFE's Tampa, Florida office, running guns to Honduras. Today, Vanderboegh answers the \"Why Honduras?\" question (basically, as we have discussed more than once in the past, the real source of Mexican \"crime guns\" has quite a lot to do with Central America).\n \n\n \n Want to tell all the good people about Virginia O'Brian and Scott McCambell?

   "  Did ATF train corrupt Mexican police? -- Army disarms crooked cops after 'guns-to-drug-lords' scheme \n As part of the project, the ATF conducted 12 training sessions for Mexican police in several Mexican cities, according to the Government Accountability Office, or GAO. The ATF trained officers at police stations that were raided and shut down by the Mexican government as part of a massive corruption sting in which police officers were arrested. \n \n According to the GAO report, the ATF trained Mexican police in the cities of Mexico City, Tijuana, Nuevo Laredo, Rosarito and Matamoros. \n \n Most of those cities had their police forces subject to massive Mexican government raids in which the police had their weapons confiscated and some were arrested. \n\n \n MS 13 is the Deadliest Gang on Earth! \n   ATF Tampa Division Walked Guns to Honduras and to MS13 Gang Members \n Leaders of the transnational organized criminal gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) even ordered a hit on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in New York.\n \n There are now reports that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Tampa Field Division, ran a gun-running investigation that was walking guns to Honduras using the techniques and tactics identical to Fast and Furious. 1,000 of those guns were sold to MS13 buyers.\n\n   Stimulus Dollars Funded Mexican Coffin Industry through \"Operation Fast and Furious\" \n Not content with just using American tax dollars to subsidize foreign \"green jobs\" that replaced U.S. jobs, the Obama administration used stimulus dollars to pay for purchases of guns by Mexican drug lords in \"Operation Fast and Furious,\" resulting in the murder of a U.S. Border Patrol agent and many Mexicans. That stimulated nothing, except for Mexico's coffin industry, notes Mark Steyn in the National Review. In the Operation, \n \n \n the federal government used stimulus funding to buy guns from Arizona gun shops for known criminals to funnel to Mexican drug cartels. . .Supposedly, United States taxpayers were picking up the tab for Mexican drug lords' weaponry in order that the ATF could identify high-up gun-traffickers. But, as it turns out, these high-up gun-traffickers were already known to other agencies - FBI, DEA, and other big-spending acronyms in the great fetid ooze of federal alphabet soup in which this republic is drowning. And, indeed, some of those high-ups are said to have been paid informants for those various federal agencies. So, in case you're wondering why Obama's second annual Recovery Summer is a wee bit sluggish at your end, relax: Stimulus dollars went to fund one federal agency to buy guns for the paid informants of another federal agency to funnel to foreign criminals in order that the first federal agency might identify the paid informants of the second federal agency.\n \n while, what did the drug cartels, the recipients of the guns, do with them? Well, they used them to kill at least one member of a third federal agency: Brian Terry of the United States Border Patrol. If that doesn't bother you, well, they also killed not insignificant numbers of Mexican civilians. If, by this stage, you're wondering why U.S. stimulus dollars are being used to stimulate the Mexican coffin industry, consider the dark suspicion of many American gun owners - that the real reason the feds embarked on this murderous scheme was to plant the evidence that the increasing lawlessness on the southern border is the fault of the gun industry and the Second Amendment, and thereby advance its ideological agenda of ever greater gun control.\n\n \n \n Now I feel Really Dirty. Apparently, I was paying for a Mexican and MS 13 drug gang jobs training program all along. \n \n Thanks President Obama! You make me Real Proud to be an American these days!!!! emoticon_cry",

   "Issa and Grassley respond to Obama's new gun control \n Here is Issa's blistering response:\n \n \"This political maneuver seems designed to protect the careers of political appointees at the Justice Department and not public safety. It's disconcerting that Justice Department officials who may have known about or tried to cover-up gunwalking in Operation Fast and Furious are continuing attempts to distract attention from clear wrongdoing. In Operation Fast and Furious, gun dealers didn't need this regulation as they voluntarily provided ATF agents with information about suspected straw purchasers.  In return for this voluntary cooperation, the Justice Department betrayed them by offering false assurances that they would closely monitor sales of weapons that dealers otherwise did not want to make.\" \n\n \n And here is the statement from Sen. Grassley:\n \n\"We've learned from our investigation of Fast and Furious that reporting multiple long gun sales would do nothing to stop the flow of firearms to known straw purchasers because many Federal Firearms Dealers are already voluntarily reporting suspicious transactions. In fact, in just the documents we've obtained, we are aware of 150 multiple long guns sales associated with the ATF's Fast and Furious case, and despite the fact that nearly all of these sales were reported in real time by cooperating gun dealers, the ATF watched the guns be transported from known straw purchasers to third parties and then let the guns walk away, often across the border.  This makes it pretty clear that the problem isn't lack of burdensome reporting requirements. The administration's continued overreach with regulations continues, and is a distraction from its reckless policy to allow guns to walk into Mexico.\"\n\n\n emoticon_rolleyes",

Even if the emergency regulations were implemented by executive order signed by the president the ATF is still operating without authority under the law. This should concern anyone who believes in fairness, order, and the constitution itself.\n \n Lawsuits have not been threatened in response, but rather they have been promised should the ATF try to exercise this newly granted authority even once. This will put the government in a difficult position of having to defend both its actions and the policy itself, diverting funds it doesn't even possess to engage in a legal battle it has no business in to begin with.

   "Did Fast & Furious violate the Arms Export Control Act?\n by David Hardy \u00b7 \n \nFirst, the Arms Export Control Act, 22 USC \u00a72778.. It authorizes the President to define defense articles and regulate their export. In so doing, he must consider the possibility that export could \"support international terrorism, increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict...\"\n \n Those defense articles may not be exported without a permit, issued by the Secretary of State ( Department of State guidelines here), \"except that no license shall be required for exports or imports made by or for an agency of the United States Government\n \n (A) for official use by a department or agency of the United States Government, or\n \n (B) for carrying out any foreign assistance or sales program authorized by law and subject to the control of the President by other means.\"\n \n The firearms involved here were not being exported for official use by an agency, nor as part of foreign aid. This a lot narrower than the GCA exception for acts by a government agency, and for good reason: the purpose of this statute is to control executive agency actions. No gun running to foreign governments or persons without a paper trail (and in cases of large transactions, a prior request for Congressional approval).\n \n Any person who willfully violates these provisions \"shall upon conviction be fined for each violation not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\"\n \n There have been some reports of agents having directly transferred firearms to drug cartel buyers, in order to boost their \"street creds.\" That'd clearly be a violation. In other situations, the person who actually exported the firearms would be in clear violation. But what of those government supervisors who allowed the arms to flow -- especially the cases where a protesting FFL was told to sell the guns anyway?\n \n 18 U.S. Code \u00a72 provides:\n \n \"\u00a7 2. Principals\n \n (a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\n \n (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.\"\n\n Again, HOW did we get so lawless?",

That must mean it is now a safe topic.... so today.\n \n The   New York Times gives it space.\n \n So does the  LA Times. \n \n   USA Today  weighs in.\n \n The  Toledo Blade's ombudsman  outlines the story and concedes the paper should have carried it sooner. \"Frankly, while there has been nothing unethical about The Blade's not having covered it, Operation Fast and Furious probably deserves more scrutiny.\"\n \n If there is a theme to the above (it may be coincidence), damage control seems to have shifted from \"nothing was done wrong\" to \"don't mention the Attorney General or his deputies.\"\n \n And in the meantime, the House Committee on Oversight releases  releases another report, and holds more hearings -- live video  here. Just listened to a guy doing damage control, claiming that straw purchasers by definition have a clean record -- which, as posted below, isn't true when the ATF and FBI \"fix\" the background checks -- and usually get probation -- Federal sentencing guidelines call for 1-2 years in prison for that offense, if first offense.\n \n Mr. Meehan is now questioning former SAC Bill Newell. He's asking who originated the plan. Newell refuses to name a single person, finally says four people in his office did. Did the other agent who testified participate in it? He was aware of it. Mr. Mahon, the \"plaza boss.\" regional head for a cartel, you said he gives orders to buy. Plaza boss is in Mexico, right? Yes. Now, you claim the strategy wasn't to allow guns to go to Mexico. How does that work? Other agencies involved? Yes, ICE, IRS, DEA. Did they know about this program? Yes. Were they aware guns were being walked to Mexico. Witness evades, they were aware of the strategy. \n \n Ms. Burke: was this gunwalking a breach of ATF usual ops? Agent Canino: First time I've heard of it happening in 22 yrs of service with ATF. I initially heard of Agent Dodson's allegations, didn't believe them. Then I saw documents that convinced me he was telling the truth. Other agents say same thing.

This column discussed his e-mail back on March 4, which essentially was a \"my way or the highway\" ultimatum. Gillett is the man identified early on in a letter from Senator Charles Grassley to acting ATF Director Kenneth Melson as having confronted a subordinate over that agent's cooperation with Grassley staffers who were asking questions about the operation, which this column discussed. Gillett has subsequently hired private counsel and started cooperating with the investigation, earning for himself some whistleblower protection that he allegedly violated when he confronted the earlier whistleblower. Gillett is the man who abruptly hung up on this column when asked about Fast and Furious.)\n \n Newell essentially took the same tack under questioning from Congressman Dan Burton, as though he did not clearly understand the question.

But from the very beginning, he and other agents realized their mission in Phoenix wasn't to stop the guns at all.\n \"Stand down,\" the investigators were told whenever they sought permission to make a stop and attempt to retrieve the weapons. \"Just surveil.\"\n \n At times, agents followed buyers to their homes or drop points, but they would eventually be instructed to leave. They saw guns being transferred from one car into another, but then watched as that car drove away with the weapons.\n (On Dec. 14th Brian Terry was killed.) \"I just felt sick,\" Agent Dodson says. \"I still do.\"\n \n Worse, he knew that hundreds more weapons sold as part of Fast and Furious were still out there in the hands of criminals who wouldn't hesitate to use them.\n \n (The article continues with Lies, I mean with words the Left want to hear, then we get back to what really happened.) \n \n It's an approach that some longtime ATF agents found astonishing.\n \n \"I can tell you in every case I was involved in, the bureau would've been afraid to let the guns go,\" said William Vizzard, who worked almost 30 years doing gun investigations for ATF and later taught criminal justice at California State University. \"There was always the obsessive fear that if a gun goes out there ... it may be misused and traced back to you, and the political implications are terrible.\"\n \n Mike Bouchard, a former assistant director for field operations, said the endless criticism may have left some at ATF figuring, \"No matter what we do we're going to get beat up. &#8230;.\n \n Jay Wachtel worked more than two decades as an ATF agent in Arizona and California, where he ran his own gun-trafficking unit. He now teaches firearms law and policy at California State University, Fullerton. &#8230;. But letting guns walk into Mexico was unheard of, he said.\n \n Wachtel recalled a few times in his career in which loads were lost &#8211; including one suspect with 20-30 guns that his team lost in traffic &#8211; and the devastation agents felt.\n \n \"You have to be an idiot not to worry about what happens with guns,\" he said. \"We used to lose sleep.\" The very same fear gripped some members of Group VII from the start.\n\n Come On.

Rightfully so, since evidence mounts that this was the DOJ's plan all along to create their mythical \"river of guns\" from America's gun stores into Mexico.\n \n But another corrupt government gun supplier deserves attention, too. Details are still emerging about cartel agents who took over the town of Columbus, New Mexico.\n \n Blas \"Woody\" Gutierrez, 30, a former Columbus village trustee, pleaded guilty in federal court in Las Cruces to one count of conspiracy, three counts of making false statements in the acquisition of firearms and three counts of smuggling firearms from the United States.\n \n Gutierrez admitted he organized the conspiracy, along with Columbus's mayor Eddie Espinoza, police chief Angelo Vega, and 12 others.\n \n After paying the police chief for \"protection,\" Gutierrez bought weapons, tactical gear and body armor, and smuggled the items to the Ciudad Juarez-based La Linea drug cartel...At least some of the trips were made using village vehicles, for which Gutierrez paid the former mayor...\n \n They smuggled about 200 guns into Mexico. Gutierrez's lawyer claims six of them were part of Fast and Furious, which leaves 194 that were Columbus government's responsibility.\n \n Promoting their anti-gun propaganda, Reuters wrote that three of the six were \"cop killer\" pistols. They're likely referring to the gun used by Nidal Hasan to commit the Fort Hood massacre.\n \n While it can shoot ammunition that penetrates Kevlar vests, anti-rights media always omit mentioning the civilian ban included in the same federal code that outlaws straw buyers.

   "Yet another gun smuggling scandal by the gov't sanctioned atf:\n \n Eastern Arizona Courier\n \n \nA congressional investigation is presently underway to ferret out the misconduct of the ATF and to determine who authorized such rogue behavior. Thanks to several ATF whistleblowers, at least five accusations have been leveled against the ATF and Department of Justice, and those follow:\n \n 1. That they instructed U.S. gun dealers to proceed with questionable and illegal sales of firearms to suspected gunrunners.\n \n 2. That they allowed or even actively assisted in moving guns across the U.S. border into Mexico to \"boost the numbers\" of American civilian market firearms seized in Mexico and thereby providing the justification for more stringent Second Amendment restrictions on American citizens, which would result in additional power, control and money for the ATF.\n \n 3. That they intentionally kept Mexican authorities in the dark about the operation, even over objections of their own agents.\n \n 4. That the weapons ATF let \"walk\" into Mexico were involved in the deaths of Border Patrol Officer Brian Terry and ICE Agent Jaime Zapata, as well as at least hundreds of Mexican citizens.\n \n 5. That since the death of Brian Terry on Dec. 14, 2010, the Obama administration has purposely been engaged in a full-press cover-up of the facts behind what has come to be known as the \"Gunwalker Scandal.\"\n \n Also, it has recently been discovered that over $50 million of taxpayer \"stimulus\" money has been provided to the ATF the past few years to help fund these schemes. As a result, it probably will not be very difficult for Congress to follow the money to see where it leads and who approved what and when.\n \n Interestingly, most of the media has been reluctant to report this information, instead beating the familiar drum that the guns going into Mexico are being provided by legitimate American retail gun dealers, NRA members and lawful private gun owners and completely ignoring the fact most American gun owners do not own military assault rifles and auto pistols, the favored weapons of the Mexican crime organizations.\n \n As more facts are disclosed, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the attitude of the ATF and DOJ to \"break the law in order to enforce the law\" will eventually have serious consequences and could even further damage a presidency that is already under siege from several fronts.\n",

   " ATF's gun surveillance program showed early signs of failure \n Reporting from Washington- \n In March 2010, the No. 2 man at the ATF was deeply worried. His agents had lost track of hundreds of firearms. Some of the guns, supposed to have been tracked to Mexican drug cartels, were lost right after they cleared the gun stores.\n \n Five months into the surveillance effort - dubbed Operation Fast and Furious - no indictments had been announced and no charges were immediately expected. Worse, the weapons had turned up at crime scenes in Mexico and the ATF official was worried that someone in the United States could be hurt next.\n \n But indictments did not come for another 10 months. By then, two semiautomatics had been recovered after a U.S. Border Patrol agent was killed south of Tucson, and nearly 200 had been found at crime scenes in Mexico.\n \n Indeed, according to memos, emails and other material obtained by The Times, along with transcripts of sworn depositions and Capitol Hill testimony, the Justice Department provided the initial impetus for what became Fast and Furious. \n",
