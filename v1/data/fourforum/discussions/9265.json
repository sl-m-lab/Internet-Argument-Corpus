Go join the ranks of Limbaugh listeners if that's what you want. Nobody's \"demanding\" anything. (more hyperbole on your part.)

You know, like the issue that you pretend isn't such a debate and want it to be treated as if it isn't (like interracial marriage)? emoticon_xangel \n\n That's right.\n YOU have a different set of standards for issues that YOU consider to be \"major debates\".\n i.e. where your opinion isn't necessarily the one being reflected...\n \n You keep avoiding my example and giving no real reason for doing so.\n When I'm talking about the late 80's / early 90's period, where the nation was split about 50/50 on the interracial marriage issue, would THAT be a situation requiring all the \"controversy\" standards that you have espoused???\n \n Would that mean that a guy in the late 80's, who published an interracial marriage announcement and got hate mail, should publish \"both sides\" when he writes an article about that hate mail???\n \n You keep ignoring this issue over and over and over again.\n The analogy is real, but you want to ignore it...\n \n (And the truly funny thing is that ALL this will bite you in the XXX if you ever live to see a time period where your side has diminished in numbers to significantly less than a majority.)\n \n \n \nFoundit, if you want to only read opinions that don't have both sides of this national debate and pretend it's not one, knock yourself out.\n\n MORE FALSEHOODS from Jyoshu.\n 1) I have never said ANYTHING about \"wanting to only read opinions that don't have both sides\". I am talking about a guy writing an OPINION PIECE about the hate mail he got and how it is just plain stupid to complain when he doesn't give the other side equal time.\n \n 2) \"pretend it's not one\". I have NEVER pretended that there isn't a national debate on the issue. It's a really bad lie on your part to pretend otherwise.\n My issue is what you claim should happen JUST BECAUSE there is a \"controversy\" on something. THOSE THINGS that you think should happen are just inane and ridiculous based on a reason that lacks the purpose you want to give it.\n \n It's like Jack saying that we should invite the KKK to the Republican convention, with podium time, just because they got enough signatures together...\n \n \n \nNobody's \"demanding\" anything. (more hyperbole on your part.)\n\n Dude, quibbling over whether you're \"complaining\" or \"demanding\" or whatever you want to call it DOES NOT constitute a \"hyperbole\"...\n \n \n \nBut when a editorialist presents things in an unbalanced light, I just might point it out, as in this case.\n\n And again, HOW WOULD YOU have written an article about the hate mail you got on an issue and make it \"balanced\".\n \n \n \nYou know what I'm talking about, Foundit. You're smart enough to know what it takes to present an issue in a balanced way. Stop dishonestly acting as if you don't. \n\n 1) Jyoshu, DO NOT pretend to tell me what I do and do not know.\n I REALLY don't get you. A lot of what you say is just bizarre and baffles me, and I don't understand how anybody can actually say such things and pretend they come off as \"pro gay rights\".\n So your attempt to label me as \"dishonest\" for not understanding something which you haven't really explained??? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n 2) \"an issue in a balanced way\"?\n The issue here WAS THIS GUY'S HATE MAIL.\n Tell me how you would have written that in a balanced way.\n Explain that.\n \n \n \nThose aren't the responses I'm talking about, Foundit.\n\n Of course you don't want to talk about those responses jyoshu.\n Much like you don't want to acknowledge the vehement anti-gay position held by many who are against gay marriage.\n Much like you want to talk about being against \"gay actions\" when in reality we're talking about people and impositions that have nothing to do with gay sex. \n \n \n \nSure, you'd like to focus only on the hateful ones. I'm talking about the legitimate opinion ones. The funny thing is though, the author should know the other side of the debate regardless of the responses he got ....\n\n Please. Tell me what \"legitimate opinion ones\" you are talking about?\n Explain to me WHAT response you know of that he got, complaining about the paper printing a WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT for a gay couple which was not even trying to get married with legal recognition.\n \n Is this what we're reduced to?\n Even when gays get married WITHOUT suing for legal recognition, we gotta give air time to people who come forth because they don't like the fact that we JUST HELD A CEREMONY???\n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nI said YES.\n\n Where did you supposedly say that?\n \n \n \nYou give a strawman to begin with about interracial marriage, and so I give a counter analogy, then you call MY analogy a strawman.\n\n I count TWO gross falsehoods in that statement. And it leads me to believe that Jyoshu hasn't a clue what \"strawman\" means in the first place...\n \n strawman: \n The straw man fallacy is when you misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, knock down that misrepresented position, then conclude that the original position has been demolished. It's a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.\n http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mathew/logic.html#strawman\n \n 1) \"strawman to begin with about interracial marriage\".\n I gave an ARGUMENT involving interracial marriage. I never said that YOU had given that argument or any other noted misrepresentations of your position. MY argument was not a \"strawman\".\n \n 2) \"you call MY analogy a strawman\"\n This is just a gross falsehood.\n I labelled your CLAIMS REGARDING MY POSITION as a falsehood. THAT was the strawman.\n \n And to refresh everybody's memory on what FALSEHOODS/misrepresentations he told: 1) For a polygamous marriage announcement? It's a MARRIAGE ANNOUNCEMENT Jyoshu. You don't print those with additional commentary from disapproving parties.\n So, to answer your question, I would think that the ANNOUNCEMENT would be printed without need for people to voice their negative opinions in the same article.\n \n 2) \"expect NO one to disagree\".\n Really jyoshu. If I didn't have a sign of your utter desparation before I read this, I have it now.\n I NEVER intimated that I \"expect NO one to disagree\".\n My complaint is the VEHEMENCE by which they voice their disagreement.\n My issue is with this ridiculous pretense that we have to print objecting party opinions next to some WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENTS.\n \n \nDO you REALLY expect to be taken seriously here?\n\n Do you REALLY expect that anybody IS TAKING you seriously here?\n Because it's not me that is having the problem with people \"taking seriously\"...\n \n \n \nHeh, well apparently YOU think they are, given that you're using that to refute my desire to see an editorial be balanced. \n\n How do you make an editorial on \"hate mail\" balanced?\n I seriously want an explanation.\n \n \n \nThey don't have to do that at all. (and you know I know that! emoticon_xdonno ) But the good ones are able to present all sides and argue a side. Not just take the cheap way out. I'm simply saying this is my preference, and you're making a MAJOR mountain out of a molehill here.\n\n This guy writes an editorial about the hate mail he received.\n You insist that he needs to be more balanced.\n And I am the one making a mountain out of a molehill...\n \n Oh gawd.

   "No - people were ticked off that he didn't paint the monster they are so sure is real. That he didn't jusitify their fear, their ignorance and their HATE. You don't respond with virulent hate mail if you are thoughtfully disagreeing. Are you really this willfully blind?\n\n \n Just like Foundit, you miss the point. The point is that he's a.) either only talking about the virulent hate mail, or b.)portraying (some of it) as hate mail when it isn't. Some of the mail he got surely just simply disagreed. There is no reason to portray even mere disagreement on this as hate mail. I know you'll disagree because you think the issue can't even be debated unless it's hate (because you overuse that concept).\n \n \nI love how bigots then and now seem to think that it is up for debate whether other kinds of people rights, treatment and acknowledgment are up for freakin' deabate. What a bleedin, ugly, arrogant concept. They very idea that any other human has to wait on your leave to see whether they are worthy enough to be treated well or acknowledged. Just who in the hell do you think you are?\n\n \n What the XXXX are you even talking about??? emoticon_rolleyes We're talking about accurately reflecting a national debate. Not people \"waiting on your leave\" (whatever the heck that means.)\n \n \nUh. Gee Jyoshu.\n You MIGHT want to rethink that one...\n\n \n Oh WOW. Foundit can use Google to look for exceptions to the rule. How impressive. But of course Christian news sources isn't usually the same as \"churches.\" You do realize that, right?\n \n \nOf course you don't want to talk about those responses jyoshu. Much like you don't want to acknowledge the vehement anti-gay position held by many who are against gay marriage.\n Much like you want to talk about being against \"gay actions\" when in reality we're talking about people and impositions that have nothing to do with gay sex.\n\n \n Do you actually think the only responses this guy got was the vitriolic ones? And you'd like to think it's always about people and impositions, but that doesn't describe many peoples' views. The reason I focus on actions is that it's the ACCURATE opposition in so many cases, rather than ALWAYS being just \"anti-gay\" or against \"people\".\n \n \nJust out of curiousity, are those \"quoted phrases\" mine?\n Or just phrases you made up?\n\n \n Those are phrases that your movement and other posts here by people in your movement put out all the time, and your phrase is in that catagory. Don't pretend that isn't the case.\n \n \nYou keep avoiding my example and giving no real reason for doing so. When I'm talking about the late 80's / early 90's period, where the nation was split about 50/50 on the interracial marriage issue, would THAT be a situation requiring all the \"controversy\" standards that you have espoused??? Would that mean that a guy in the late 80's, who published an interracial marriage announcement and got hate mail, should publish \"both sides\" when he writes an article about that hate mail???\n\n \n What's hilarious is that if it had been an editorial saying that gays shouldn't get married to each other, and had ONLY given that viewpoint without reflecting both sides (or just your side), you'd be arguing against it too. So drop the pretense that you're just defending this guy for giving an opinion and just admit that you WANT him to be one-sided because you agree with him.\n \n \n1) I have never said ANYTHING about \"wanting to only read opinions that don't have both sides\". I am talking about a guy writing an OPINION PIECE about the hate mail he got and how it is just plain stupid to complain when he doesn't give the other side equal time.\n\n \n What's plain stupid is that you aren't even acknowleding that he certainly got mail that WASN'T hate mail about but still disagreed with him, and THAT'S where there's a lack of balance. Are you starting to get this?\n \n \nAnd again, HOW WOULD YOU have written an article about the hate mail you got on an issue and make it \"balanced\".\n\n \n Easy: don't just write about the hate mail. Include the other mail too.\n \n \nI REALLY don't get you. A lot of what you say is just bizarre and baffles me, and I don't understand how anybody can actually say such things and pretend they come off as \"pro gay rights\".\n\n \n What the heck?? How did we just make a leap from talking about whether this guy was balanced or not to whether or not I'm pro-gay rights? Do you not realize a person can be pro-gay rights disagree with thing and tactics your movement does? I am pro-gay rights in SOME things (not all of them). In other words, I agree with some things. Believe it or not Foundit, most people aren't lockstep on every issue with you. But I am NOT part of the gay pride movement, and you can take that to the bank.\n \n \nPlease. Tell me what \"legitimate opinion ones\" you are talking about? Explain to me WHAT response you know of that he got, complaining about the paper printing a WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT for a gay couple which was not even trying to get married with legal recognition.\n\n \n Oh come on, you know he didn't just ONLY get hate mail. You don't really think that, do you?\n \n Re. the rest of your post about who's using strawmans and who's being taken seriously, or whatever other non-sustantive thing you want to get into, I'm not biting. If you want to discuss the issues without insulting, getting into another one of your tit-for-tat spats, missing the point, ad hominem, and arrogantly pretending everyone here is on your side when they aren't--all of which you're infamously known for here (yes, you are--IMs get around), let me know.

There is no reason to portray even mere disagreement on this as hate mail.\n\n Did he say anything which claimed that he ONLY got disagreement in the form of hate mail???\n \n \n \nWe're talking about accurately reflecting a national debate.\n\n Did he ever claim to be writing an article \"accurately reflecting a national debate\"?\n To me, it looks ENTIRELY like he was writing an article about the hate mail he got.\n \n You keep insisting that his article should have been about something he wasn't writing about. And you give some absolutely lame innuendo for why you think it should be that way.\n \n \n \nOh WOW. Foundit can use Google to look for exceptions to the rule. How impressive.\n\n \"exceptions\" to a rule? These are fairly big \"exceptions\".\n \n And more to the point Jyoshu, which you are predictably avoiding with pointless sarcasm, WHY DO THESE \"news\" organizations not present the \"balanced\" information that you demand of the article at the focus of this thread???\n Do you think these \"news\" organizations SHOULD present a fair and balanced approach to gay marriage? Do you criticize them for not doing so?\n \n Are you going to completely ignore these questions???\n \n \n \nBut of course Christian news sources isn't usually the same as \"churches.\" You do realize that, right?\n\n Pointless non-sequitur.\n Address the questions above.\n \n \n \nDo you actually think the only responses this guy got was the vitriolic ones?\n\n Okay. ANOTHER question from Jyoshu which presents a false and never even hinted at scenario.\n The answer to your question is \"no\", and I never intimated any possible thought of \"yes\" in my statements.\n \n \n \nAnd you'd like to think it's always about people and impositions, but that doesn't describe many peoples' views.\n\n And AGAIN Jyoshu runs with strawman arguments.\n No. I don't think it's \"always\" about that. I acknowledge some more moderate positions against gay sex.\n But at the same time, I don't try to dress up obvious opposition to GAYS, without even the hint of gay sex, as \"just\" about \"behavior\"...\n \n \n \nThose are phrases that your movement and other posts here by people in your movement put out all the time, and your phrase is in that catagory. Don't pretend that isn't the case.\n\n Ahhh. Is this one of those \"we all think alike\" scenarios? Or guilt by association?\n < end sarcasm <\n \n My statement was entirely accurate.\n This guy received HATE MAIL that ATTACKED him personally.\n Do you refute that statement. Because if your real complaint is that you don't like how I phrased it, even though it is 100% ACCURATE, then you've got no point.\n \n \n \nWhat's hilarious is that if it had been an editorial saying that gays shouldn't get married to each other, and had ONLY given that viewpoint without reflecting both sides (or just your side), you'd be arguing against it too.\n\n OMG. I never thought about it that way. So of COURSE my complaint that you shouldn't argue against the article is invalid...\n Oh. Wait a tick.\n My argument has NOTHING TO DO with you just arguing AGAINST the article, but ACTUALLY has to do with your SPECIFIC INANE ARGUMENT you made against the article.\n \n I understand you'll argue against it.\n The point is that your SPECIFIC ARGUMENT that the OPINION piece should have included a \"balanced\" statement, including a fair assessment of the anti-gay marriage side, is b.s.\n \n Try arguing what I'm ACTUALLY saying instead of this inane strawman approach you're trying.\n \n \n \nSo drop the pretense that you're just defending this guy for giving an opinion and just admit that you WANT him to be one-sided because you agree with him.\n\n What delicious falsehoods you tell. Utterly inane and utterly pointless, other than demonstrating that your assessment of others is wrong on SOOOO many occasions and situations...\n \n If \"this guy\" had written an opinion piece AGAINST gay marriage, I would have NEVER included ANY complaint that he should have put in a \"balanced\" approach with both sides.\n \n Hell Jyoshu. Let's cut the semantics and cut to the replay.\n I have argued COUNTLESS (okay, they could probably be counted) issues and statements and editorials on this board.\n Can you show me ANY EXAMPLE of where I have ever complained that somebody who was against gay marriage presented a one-sided approach, vice a two-sided \"balanced\" approach???\n \n (Let me guess. Another question avoided??? emoticon_confused )\n \n \n \nWhat's plain stupid is that you aren't even acknowleding that he certainly got mail that WASN'T hate mail about but still disagreed with him, and THAT'S where there's a lack of balance. Are you starting to get this?\n\n What is \"plain stupid\" is that you pretend that isn't \"acknowledged\"...\n I have never intimated otherwise, and this is the first time you've actually questioned an \"acknowledgement\" on the issue...\n \n EVEN THE ARTICLE \"acknowledges\" this... : \"Some readers criticized our telling the story through the eyes of two gay men.\n \"\n Also in the article: \"In the case of a few, I saw bigotry and unreasoning hatred that would make the Ku Klux Klan blush.\"\n \n Notice the word FEW there Jyoshu????\n Know what that means?\n \n \n \nEasy: don't just write about the hate mail. Include the other mail too.\n\n Funny how you did that...\n I asked you how you would write an article about the hate mail that was balanced, and you changed the topic of the article entirely.\n The real point of all this is that YOU DO NOT LIKE the focus on the hate mail, probably because that messes with your nice pretty pretend image that the anti-gay side is about love and \"behavior\" when it is typically about something much uglier.\n \n \n \nWhat the heck?? How did we just make a leap from talking about whether this guy was balanced or not to whether or not I'm pro-gay rights?\n\n I'm sorry. Did I lose you?\n \n \n \nDo you not realize a person can be pro-gay rights disagree with thing and tactics your movement does?\n\n Actually, it would be more truthful to say that a person's \"pro-gay rights\" position is incredibly questionable when they claim to be \"pro-gay rights\", but then disagree virtually UNILATERALLY on most of any \"things and tactics our movement does\".\n Even buying tickets to a White House event and going with matching accessories is objectionable to you. Gay dummies in a store window? The HORROR!\n (Do \"gay dummies\" engage in \"gay behavior\"?)\n \n \n \nI am pro-gay rights in SOME things (not all of them). In other words, I agree with some things. Believe it or not Foundit, most people aren't lockstep on every issue with you.\n\n Believe it or not, most people aren't \"lockstep on every issue with you\" either...\n Most people don't take time to complain about gay dummies in a Macy's window during gay pride week.\n Most people don't complain about a gay penguin book.\n Most people don't see a White House event where gay people attend with matching accessories and the anti-gay side shows up with bullhorns to protest, and then condemn the gay people as you praise the \"restraint\" of the protestors...\n \n \n \nRe. the rest of your post about who's using strawmans and who's being taken seriously, or whatever other non-sustantive thing you want to get into, I'm not biting.\n\n Of course you are not.\n You CANNOT.\n You claimed I had a position, which I clearly do not, and you cannot defend your previous claim.\n \n I find it hilarious how YOU YOURSELF accused me of \"strawman\", but when I prove that you are guilty of it, that's something that should not be \"bitten\" at...\n \n Retreat from the conversation if you need to, but you're not fooling people...",
