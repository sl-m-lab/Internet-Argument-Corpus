If allah and God are the same God, then why does this inconsistency exist at all? \n \n As for Ezra rewriting the Torah to benefit the Jews over the Arabs, can you prove that through any historical records at all? After all, that event would have been recorded around the 14th century BC when Genesis was written, and the evidence you produced was from the Quran which was written in the 6th century AD. So we're dealing with a time period when no archeological expertise existed, with a 2000 year gap to explain. So how again did you come up with this information? Are you actually suggesting that the Quran which you say is the holy book from the same God who authored the bible disagrees with the bible? So in other words, God disagrees with himself in both of His books? Can you explain that discrepancy if allah and Yahweh are one and the same God?",

Now respond to my questions below without obfuscation if you want this debate to continue. Otherwise, we can be done with it.\n \n \nHow's this, I whittled it down by deleting most of my opinion and just left the 1 comment and 1 question, in the bolded.\n \n My God say's to pray for sinners while your god say's to behead them. No eanassir, we don't worship the same God at all. And you are just lying to yourself if you believe that allah is the same God who made an everlasting covenant with Abraham, and by extension the Jewish People. How you can claim that relation while islam demands the total destruction of Israel and all Jews exposes the obvious deception in such a claim. \n THE QUESTION:\n If allah was that same god that Yahweh IS, wouldn't he have told Abraham to do the expected thing and have him give the promised inheritance to Ismaial, the eldest son of Abraham with Hagar, rather than to Isaac, the younger son by 9 years, yet the son that God had promised to Abraham and Sarah years earlier? Explain that dilemma if allah and Yahweh are the same Creator God? \n \n You know that it was customary for the eldest son to always receive the blessing from the Father, yet Abraham didn't do that. And we all know that Ismaial is the father of the Arab Nations, just as Isaac is the Father of the Jews.\n\n \n \nYou completely ignored my question eanassir. Before we can move on to discussing Jesus status as God, you must stop changing the subject and answer the discrepancy regarding Abraham not giving his eldest son Ismaial the promised blessing. Here it is again. If you are unable to defend your faith then just admit it and we will be done with it. Here is the question again, now answer it and we can then move on to the eternal nature and character of Jesus Christ, the Messiah.\n \n If allah was that same god that Yahweh IS, wouldn't he have told Abraham to do the expected thing and have him give the promised inheritance and blessing to Ismaial, the eldest son of Abraham with Hagar, rather than to Isaac, the younger son by 9 years, yet the son that God had promised to Abraham and Sarah years earlier? Explain that dilemma if allah and Yahweh are the same creator God? \n \n You know that it was customary for the eldest son to always receive the blessing from the Father, yet Abraham didn't do that. And we all know that Ismaial is the father of the Arab/islamic Nations, just as Isaac is the Father of the Jews. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS EANASSIR?\n\n \n \nYou just refuse to answer my question don't you eanassir? You can't answer that question so you must try to change the subject for the second time. Let's try this one more time. Here's my original question. http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=321058&postcount=47 The question simply is, why did Abraham break custom and give Isaac the blessing and inheritance that was traditionally reserved for the eldest son, which Ismaial was by 9 years? If allah and God are the same God, then why does this inconsistency exist at all? \n \n As for Ezra rewriting the Torah to benefit the Jews over the Arabs, can you prove that through any historical records at all? After all, that event would have been recorded around the 14th century BC when Genesis was written, and the evidence you produced was from the Quran which was written in the 6th century AD. So we're dealing with a time period when no archeological expertise existed, with a 2000 year gap to explain. So how again did you come up with this information? Are you actually suggesting that the Quran which you say is the holy book from the same God who authored the bible disagrees with the bible? So in other words, God disagrees with himself in both of His books? Can you explain that discrepancy if allah and Yahweh are one and the same God?\n",

Otherwise, we can be done with it.\n\n \n \n Obviously you have mixed many things, the results with the causes, the doctrine with the real behavior of people, and you depended on your imagination considering it as the absolute truth: like the power of darkness (while the association with God, and ascribing sons and daughters to God is the real darkness), and you have spoken about Armageddon interpreting that according to your desire. \n \n To disprove your mixing and confusion: I say: \n Who cast the hydrogen bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Was he a Christian? Then the Christianity - according to your deduction - is bloody and full of transgression on people! \n Who almost exterminated a whole human race: the Red Indians? \n Who enslaved the Africans, stole them from their parents and took them to another land and enslaved them to work as slaves in their farms? Were they Christians? \n Who kindled the Two World Wars, with millions of victims?\n Who now is stirring wars everywhere in the world?\n \n In fact, the same who did all such transgression, he aided the enemy of Palestine to the disadvantage of the Palestinian people, the Arab and the Muslims; all that was (and still it is) out of their rancor against the Arabs and Muslims.\n http://quranandhebrewbible.t35.com/english3.htm#Balfour_Declaration_November_2_1917_\n \n http://quranandhebrewbible.t35.com/english3.htm#England_Aimed_From_This_Declaration_to_Two_Goals_\n http://quranandhebrewbible.t35.com/english3.htm#The_Role_of_the_American_Imperialism_\n \n \n Then you started to accuse me with lying; when in fact it is you - and every other associater and idolater - that lie against yourself, against God and against the truth.

Are you actually suggesting that the Quran which he say's is the holy book from the same God who authored the bible disagrees with the bible?

Even though he put forward arguments that further demonstrates the point he's making, you keep parroting that he never answered the question. His answer, whether true or not, is a valid response as to why it would seem that abraham broke tradition and blessed the younger son. The response is that the tradition wasn't broken, but that it was made to seem that way by jewish scribes who wanted their country to look good. \n \n Since you say that you already acknowledged his answering the question, then why keep molesting him that he didn't answer it?\n \n Furthermore, why don't you answer his question? Why is it that at the time abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son, did God say \"your only son who you love\"? Did God forget that isaac was abraham's second son? Explain that please archangel.\n \n Also, I don't know if you know this, but judaism and christianity are two very different religions. Isn't it the same God over both religions? And christianity itself is factioned into more denominations and non-denominations than can be kept track of. Isn't it the same God over all these religions as well? By everything we see here, inconsistency in religions is one of God's strong suits. Are you telling me that you have a peoblem believing that God is or can be inconsistent?",

Of course, you are limited because you are using a biased translation, and are not looking at it in the original langauge.

The term 'Word' in John 1 is \"LOGOS\", which had a very specific philosophical meaning. There are very strong indications (such as one of the early church fathers proclaiming it) that John was originally a gnostic piece of writing, and the way the gnostic used \"LOGOS\" was having it the 'Wisdom of God'.. not God itself. So, for you to have 'Logos' 'the word' be god, you have to assume it means god and the trinity. You have to totally ignore the history of the Gospel of John, and make unwarranted assumptions.

If I had only the Pentateuch, I could be led to, learn from, worship and honor Messiah who died for my sins and fulfilled the prophecies in that book that promised His coming.\n \n \nCome Sunday, you turn on the TV, and you always come out with some minister or Priest.. and what are they doing?? They are quoting from MY BOOK, and interpreting it. And, I have to tell you, their interpretation is usually wrong. It's not their fault, because it's not their book. You never hear a rabbi quoting and interpreting from the 'New' testament , now DO YOU?\n\n \n According to your antiquated, Pre-Messianic interpretation of it they are misinterpreting it. But just because you can't appreciate the fullness of the message contained within your book, if doesn't mean that the Messianic interpretation is in error.",
