   "I think that there is something morally wrong with it and that there's no need to elaborate in this circumstance.\n \n I think there is something morally wrong with an obsolete practice, that being abortion, merely because it is unnecessary---at least, in its most common function, that is to relieve someone's inconvenience. Nobody should have to die for somebody's convenience.\n \n I also don't buy the common statement that abortion is a 'woman's right'. The logic in that belief is easily shot down with statistics. There have been over 40 million abortions and they havn't only been little boys, they were little girls, too. I respect women much, much more than I respect men, too. So, I am sexist, and it's all to womens' advantage.\n \n Yes, it is an awful thing that women suffer from an unfair burden---that is, that the man can leave her and go on living a normal life without anyone ever knowing what happened. But that still doesn't justify murder.\n \n I find it highly ironic that democrats tend to justify abortion by saying that those children would grow up to lead 'bad' lives, merely because they are more likely to grow into an unwealthy home. Isn't this supposed to be the 'party of the people'? Aren't they the 'defenders of the poor'? No, actually, they seem to be killing them off... blunt as it sounds, it's the truth.\n \n Of course, I support abortion in some instances, where rape, incest, or the mother's life is in danger.\n \n The sad thing is that abortion isn't necessary. The Republicans, surprisingly, aren't helping to clear the path to place further restrictions on abortion. We could supply finances to ensure that these babies that are given up to the state can live in nice foster homes, go to good schools with vouchers, and find good jobs by utilizing a new form of affirmative action that doesn't rely on skin color at all, but rather, on financial background.\n \n But, we don't.",

Since we can respect the woman's choice to remove the fetus from her body, and we cannot yet respect the fetus' presumed choice to live once it is removed from the mother's body, it is permissable that the fetus dies.

   "So we can conclude, as we did with another member here, that you are putting a personal want over a life? Or in other words, someone not getting what they want is worse then death.\n No, that would be a straw man - whether someone gets what they want is immaterial. We can conclude, however, that the situation of abortion demands that we respect a right to personal autonomy even when we cannot respect a right to life. \n \n \nSo you don't support abortion then? An abortion kills the fetus inside the mother. In fact, late term abortion can literally hack it to pieces and pull it out one by one.\n No, I support a woman's right to choose. I believe it saves time and makes it easier to extract the fetus if you kill it in utero. \n \nKeep in mind I still don't believe the mother has any right to eject it as she was the one that put it there in the first place. Thats like bringing a guest in your house putting him/her in a locked room and saying get out or I will kill you and then killing him because he/she \"wouldn't\" leave....\n I'd say that the situation is much more like inviting some people around for a party and having one of them refusing to leave like you asked.\n \nYou aren't allowed to drink until 21, you can't smoke weed, you can't walk around naked...those are three examples of your \"right to personal autonomy\" that are restricted. IT is not in the US Consitution as I have read it hundreds of times. You may have rights that are part of what would be total personal autonomy but you certiainly doen't have one for 100% total personal autonomy. The right is not necessary because you could survive without having any right to your own body. However, without a right to life you have no rights at all because you can't even exist so once someone abuses that right the others go away too.\n I think you're having difficulty with how rights work. Rights don't just trump each other, but restrict each other as well. Rights are restricted by other rights which justify such laws against alcohol and drug use. These laws function to protect other rights than personal autonomy, and in such a conflict it is quite reasonable to restrict the scope of personal autonomy rights. Personal autonomy may trump several other rights when in direct conflict, but these situations are not a direct conflict. \n \n A right to life, interestingly, is not necessary to actually be alive. Harvesting someone's body for organs, for example, requires the permission of the donor or their guardian and is an example of how personal autonomy rights operate after the cessation of life.",

   "Ownership of someone elses body is something we already outlawed. As for the baby not being able to live without the womans body..well this is true. However, there are many things you rely on to keep you alive and this doesn't mean they \"own\" you.\n\n \n And you continue. Keep it up - a few more steps and you will be like VoR and will only see pregnancy and death as possibilities for women.\n \n \nI didn't think we are talking about rape so lets leave that out for now.\n\n \n k\n \n \nForce pregnancy is not something I see. \n\n \n Nor will it be something you ever have to experience is it? So damned easy for you to throw shoulda woulda haveta around soemthing you never have to face. Maybe you could shut your yap and listen to the women a little bit?\n \n \nIf you willingly have sex and thus create a baby then this was not a forced \"hijacking\" but it was forced on the unborn. If you choose to be a part of creating a life then you have no business trying to end it as you have no right. I still have \"right to exist (life) (live)\" over any other right you could think of.\n\n \n And if you do it? Nothing. Whether and how you participate is up to you and your body will never be used against your will. \n \n And you are wrong by the way - I actually DO have the right to an abortion. \n \n \nNo, not even close. Can you smoke weed? No. Can you run around naked? No. Can you fire a gun at someone? No. In other words, you can't do what you want with your body. It makes no sense and this right doesn't exist.\n\n \n Any action that does not harm another is fine with me. And even some action that does harm another is fine with me (depends on situation). Far as I am concerned you can get high and run around naked all you want - not my problem.\n \n \nThen I suggest you move to Canada because the government was not created by you.\n\n \n Actually I plan to move to Toronto in about 8 years.",
