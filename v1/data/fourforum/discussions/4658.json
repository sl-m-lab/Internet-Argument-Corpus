   "I do not wish to comment on the particulars of the Schiavo case - which have been thoroughly discussed on other threads - but among the questions that have occurred to me arising from that case are these: \n \n Is it ever wise rather than expedient to legislate on the basis of a singular medical, moral, or emotive emergency ?\n \n Compassion towards a suffering human being is a natural response and in no way to be deplored, but are there circumstances in which compassion is not an appropriate response towards unrelievable suffering because it could or would result in a \"greater evil\" than prudential mercy ?",

There are many Terry Shiavo-like cases. Who is going to draw up criteria to evaluate patients on their degree of suffering--the courts? The courts have no clinical expertise. That would be like sending Judge Judy in to do a surgeon's job. emoticon_xkill \n \n The Terry Shiavo case should have been settled by her physician and her legal guardian. It is a travesty that her personal life was exploited and televised.",
