   "They are doing it right to our face.\n \n I use the term \"they\" loosely. More correctly, you are allowing it to happen. A similar question would be, \"Who is taking over The United States?\"\n \n And the answer would not be, \"super elites\" or \"secret societies\" it would be YOU!\n \n Those of you who have forgotten what The United States is, a Union of States.\n \n You are creating from our Federal system (which no longer really exists) a Unitarian system.\n \n The current status of our Federal System:\n \n Representational Federalism.\n \n What does that mean?\n \n It means the Federal Government is the only true power, and that the States only exist because the units of the Federal Government are elected by \"regions\". Representatives and Senators by the States, and the President by the Electoral College.\n \n But as we see, the Federal Government can do whatever it wants. It already has, time and time again.\n \n Garcia vs. San Antonio (1985)\n \n Roe vs. Wade (1973)\n \n These two cases greatly show the distress our Nation is in.\n \n The States are besieged, and so far the only defenders of our US Constitution has been the US Supreme Court, which very minorly revived small aspects of it in regards of Interstate Commerce.\n \n The defense of the US Constitution is not the real responsibility of the President, or the Courts, but the People. To the former it is only symbolic. To us it is real!\n \n Why should we wait for a day when the Federal Government will say, \"ok we're through now, we'll give you back your rights and your States and your freedoms.\"\n \n To wait for such a day is vain hope, we must become more aware now.\n \n The enemy to the United States is ignorance.\n \n Ignorance of States' Rights and how they have been destroyed.\n \n Without States' Rights, the Federal Government will oppress someone always.\n \n Example:\n \n Athiests remove Under God from the pledge, religious devote suffer, Federal Government declares that all schools should teach creationism, science suffers.\n \n When the Federal Government decides who wins, someone always loses. And in the game of life, that loss is unbearable.",

   "I'd be far more worried IF the federal government hadn't proven to be a more effective protector of civil rights than the states have been.\n \n I'm confused by your citation of Roe. That was a case that came up through the state court system and dealt with state controls on an issue. The only federal issue was regarding the Right to Privacy (see Griswald v. Connecticut) and its applicability here. Today, virtually all abortion rules and regulations are set by the state, all the supreme court has done is issue some baseline guidelines which they can't exceed (see Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, Steinberg v. Carhart). The only major federal regulations on abortion have been restrictive (the recently passed partial birth abortion ban for example). Roe really doesn't have much to do with federalism at all.\n \nThe States are besieged, and so far the only defenders of our US Constitution has been the US Supreme Court, which very minorly revived small aspects of it in regards of Interstate Commerce.\n \n Yes, but its an important and well crafted defense (see US v. Lopez, US v. Morrison, Printz v. United States).\n \nAthiests remove Under God from the pledge, religious devote suffer, Federal Government declares that all schools should teach creationism, science suffers.\n\n I'm going to try REALLY hard not to get into this particular debate. Suffice to say, the federal government has the authority (and obligation) to enforce our constitutional rights against both federal and state infringement, including 1st amendment rights which forbid govt. sponsership of religion. Oh and I just can't resist, I'm a theist who wants to remove Under God from the pledge.",

   "dsa, you don't know too much about history do you? Have you ever read the Federalist Papers?\n \n You do realize that you don't have the rights to things like \"abortions\" and \"marriage\".\n \n So how the Federal Government is protecting rights when it does such things, is beyond me.\n \n \"Roe really doesn't have much to do with federalism at all.\"\n \n Actually it does, James Madison (Founding Father and writer of about half the Federalist Papers) declared to the States (whom they were trying to convince to join in this new Union) that the States had the right and obligation alone to legislate morality.\n \n The Federal Government can not regulate such an issue, abortion is not a \"right\" it is an issue for the States to decide how they want to deal with it.\n \n Just like everything else.\n \n The 10th Amendment gives all powers not enumerated to the Government, to the States. Roe vs. Wade crosses that line, in fact almost everything does. Hence why we are currently in the situation of \"Representational Federalism\".\n \n Now, the way it should really be looked at, is that a great evil (a super powerful almighty Federal Government) is doing good to keep that power until all remaining opposition is gone.\n \n When that opposition is gone, naturally, the stronger majority in the nation will use the Federal government to do whatever it wants against the minority.\n \n Sure it protects individual rights right now, but when the majority turns and wants to oppress someone, who is to stop the Federal Government from doing such a thing?\n \n Do you think it is above human nature?",

   "dsa, you don't know too much about history do you? Have you ever read the Federalist Papers?\n \n I've read enough of the federalist papers to know that Madison thought that rights were MORE likely to be protected under a government that represented a broader spectrum of people vs. a smaller one (IE Fed over State). And I think that's been empirically proven over the years. I'm just confused why you think the states are a more effective protecter of rights, when logic and historical precedent suggests the reverse.\n \n You might want to read the constitution a tad bit more closely yourself, and a couple important supreme court decisions too. I'd recommend the 9th amendment for starters. And McCulloch v. Maryland puts the 10th amendment in some desperately needed context, pointing out that the lack of \"expressly\" in the text of the 10th (while it was in it in the Articles of Confederation), the existance of the Supremacy Clause w.in the constitution, and the Nec. and Proper clause of Article I Sec. 8 all limit the 10th amendment to a much smaller role than you might light.",
