   "I say jesus was for the death penalty anddddddd he was guilty.\n\n What??\n \n And what is your reasoning that Jesus was for the death penalty? For example, the only time, in my memory, that Jesus is directly confronted with the death penalty (other than his own death) is the stoning of the adulteress (sp?). He stopped this from happening and said, as I'm sure you know, \"If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her\"-- John 8:1-11.",

   "Was Jesus for the death penalty? I say jesus was for the deaht penalty anddddddd he was guilty.\n\n of course jesus was for the death penalty. long before any legal system was in place, death was the penatly for sin. the concept of crime didnt even exist at the time. in fact, the mere fact that everbody dies (including animals and plants) is proof that sin has contaminated the planet and god's system of justice works\n \n now, where jesus comes into the picture is that he was sinless. as the only sinless living thing on earth, jesus did not have the death penalty hanging over his head, and was pretty much indestructible (like god is). however, because his love for mankind moved him with compassion, he chose to make himself \"killable\", even though he never sinned. so he allowed himself to pay the penalty for sins he never commited (the death penalty), and... he died!\n \n so to answer your question: yes. not only is jesus for the death penalty, he invented it. and no, he was not guilty, but he pleaded guilty anyway\n \n disclaimer; the views in this tongue-in-cheek post are not necessarily the views of unkerpaulie, but unkerpaulie endorses everything that was said here, for the sake of the discussion, if that makes sense...",

And now the death penalty kills people that have been accused of a crime.\n \n heres more\n \u0095 The Old Testament law commanded the death penalty for various acts: murder (Exodus 21:12), kidnapping (Exodus 21:16), bestiality (Exodus 22:19); adultery (Leviticus 20:10); homosexuality (Leviticus 20:13), a false prophet (Deuteronomy 13:5), prostitution and rape (Deuteronomy 22:4), and several other crimes\n \u0095 Romans 13:4\n \u0095 Virtually all religious scholars agree that the correctly translated commandment \"Thou shalt not murder\" is a prohibition against individual cases of murder. There is no biblical prohibition against the government imposition of the death penalty in deserving cases. Indeed, the government imposition of capital punishment is required for deliberate murder. (Dr. Charles Ryrie, Biblical Answers to Contemporary Issues & The Ryrie Study Bible, Exodus 20:13).\n \u0095 \"God, Himself, instituted the death penalty (Genesis 9:6) and Christ regarded capital punishment as a just penalty for murder (Matthew 26:52). God gave to government the legitimate authority to use capital punishment to restrain murder and to punish murderers. Not to inflict the death penalty is a flagrant disregard for God's divine Law which recognizes the dignity of human life as a product of God's creation. Life is sacred, and that is why God instituted the death penalty. Consequently, whoever takes innocent human life forfeits his own right to live.\" Protestant scholar Rev. Reuben Hahn (Mt. Prospect, Ill.), Human Events, 3/2/85.\n But, you say, what about the women taken in the very act of adultery. This story is told in John 8:3-11. The scribes and Pharisees sought to find something against Jesus. Their method of operation was to ask a question or present a problem in which either solution would hurt Jesus (see several instances in Matthew 23). In this case, they presented the woman taken in adultery and reminded Jesus, \"Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?\" (v.5). If He upheld the law, the meek and lowly Jesus would be portrayed as cruel. If He made an exception to the law, He would be in favor of breaking the law. In either case, His bond with the people would be broken.\n \n However, Jesus did the unexpected. He stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground. What He wrote, we are not told. When the Pharisees insisted on an answer, He said, \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her\" (v.7) and continued writing. \n \n One interesting fact about this story: only the woman was brought. No man was accused. Yet, adultery is definitely a two-person sin. Is it possible that Jesus wrote Leviticus 20:10 on the ground? It says, \"And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.\" Notice, both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death. Not one, but both.\n \n At any rate, the consciences of the accusers began to accuse their own hearts. One by one, beginning with the eldest, they slipped away until no man was there to accuse the woman. With no accusers, there was no required penalty. Jesus had used the occasion to point out the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees while at the same time showing His love to the unloved. He told the woman to go and sin no more.",

   "\n \n However, Jesus did the unexpected. He stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground. What He wrote, we are not told. When the Pharisees insisted on an answer, He said, \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her\" (v.7) and continued writing. \n \n One interesting fact about this story: only the woman was brought. No man was accused. Yet, adultery is definitely a two-person sin. Is it possible that Jesus wrote Leviticus 20:10 on the ground? It says, \"And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.\" Notice, both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death. Not one, but both.\n \n At any rate, the consciences of the accusers began to accuse their own hearts. One by one, beginning with the eldest, they slipped away until no man was there to accuse the woman. With no accusers, there was no required penalty. Jesus had used the occasion to point out the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees while at the same time showing His love to the unloved. He told the woman to go and sin no more.\n\n \n Some think that Jesus started writting out the sins that the people there had commited and one by one they just left in shame.",

He was able to offer it before the full, final sacrifice?\n\n another very good question. this little passage addresses it nicely: matthew 9:1-8\n And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city. And behold, they brought to him a paralytic, lying on his bed; and when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, \"Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.\" And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, \"This man is blaspheming.\" But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, \"Why do you think evil in your hearts? For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\" --he then said to the paralytic--\"Rise, take up your bed and go home.\" And he rose and went home. When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.\n \n jesus had the authority to personally walk up to you and forgive your sins. after all, he was god, and the ultimate arbitrator. its also why he can say to you today (in the spirit) \"take heart, obvious child, your sins are forgiven.\" and yes, it would seem that he could simply do that without having to die, and you'd be right\n \n the thing is, jesus came to FULFILL the law. its a concept that people are still struggling with. the law of god demands death as the only way to eliminate sin. this principle has never changed. by jesus dying for no sin of his, he made it possible that anybody can put their own sins upon him (as they would a traditional sacrifice) and by that way have their sins eliminated under the law of the death penalty",

   "OK. In this case, I don't see the point in your earlier distinction between practical and religious control.\n\n did i make a distinction? my argument from the beginning is that not only jesus endorses the death penalty, he invented it and established it as the only way to cleanse the society of sin/crime\n \n \nSorry, I don't understand how this addresses the point about justice being individual specific. We can't 'pass on' guilt.\n\n guilt is not a solid or permanent state. its not a case of \"once guilty, always tarnished\". this is why i mentioned rehabilitation. once the person that did the crime/sin has gone through his punishment/penance he should no longer be still viewed as \"guilty\", because he has already went through the rehabilitative process. its what redemption is supposed to be. its like owing a creditor money. after you pay it off you are no longer still viewed as a debtor\n \n in this way, guilt, like a debt, can be \"passed on\". if i decide to pay your debt for you, you are immediately forgiven of the debt, but the debt still exists until i actually pay it off. thats the way it works. and i dont see anything unjust about it\n \n \nBut surely he was cut off from God from the moment he forgave the prostitute.\n\n correct. and being cut off from god, he died in sin and went to hell. but you also have to remember that he was god himself, and being god he was still innocent and perfect, as well as all powerful. not only that, when he died for the sins he was bearing, he immediately redeemed himself by paying the penalty for bearing sins. since his death automatically eliminated the sins, and he ressurected, he was once again sinless and fully reconcilled to god\n \n \nBut why can't there be a simple forgiveness without punishing some poor innocent sheep and/or God almighty in human form? Why is God incapable of wiping the slate clean?\n\n that is a question i cant answer. its just the wa god designed it\n \n bear in mind, throughout this discussion, we are talking about a spiritual solution to a spiritual problem. sin isnt a social issue as much as it is a spiritual issue. so the only way to handle sin is through a spiritul process, mainly by faith-based thoughts, words and deeds.\n \n \nSo we hope. I don't think it says.\n \n but the point is, she isn't asked if she accepts forgiveness, or told that she should acknowledge Christ is bearing her sins. It's certainly not clear from what he says.\n\n well, like you pointed out, it doesnt say. the story ends with the woman leaving after hearing what jesus said. you cannot assume that she doesnt accept the forgiveness, because it seems to indicate that she did accept it (or didnt reject it).\n \n back to the debt analogy. if i offer to pay your debt, do you still walk around worrying about how youre going to pay the debt? do you act as if you still owe the money? i dont need to ask you if you acknowledge me forgiving your debt. by being released of the burden of the debt, you would know, and i would know. that would be sufficient, wouldnt it?",

It ignores Jewish history, Jewish applied law, Jewish tradition and the recorded views of a society most people do not know.\n \n Context not of just the line, but the paragraph and story, the word or phrase is in, is important. So even using context there is the clear understanding that G-d meant to physically kill, and even makes distinctions between murder, execution and spiritual death. Hebrew tradition and belief, to the extent it is relevant in a Chrisitan society in the US, has always stated that people are partners with G-d in perfecting society, sharing the \"tikkun\" (reconstruction) of an ordered society along G-d principles. This includes courts, laws and yes executions. The Talmud states: \"...those who are kind to cruel will one day be cruel to the kind...\". This supports the concern for paroling, escaping or commuting prisoner sentences and its affect on society. Society is brutalized by the maintenance and release of such criminals, not their execution. The Talmud and its hundreds of rules for interpretation, printed in 499 CE, compiled over a period of hundreds of years before due to the fear of dispersion of the Jews, is the basic tool for all Jewish Law education. It is not well known or appreciated outside of Orthodox Jewish circles - but is definitive in such matters.\n \n Tirtzach (tear - tzach): murder (killing an innocent person) * Ex. 20:13: \"lo tirtzach\" - \"Do not murder\", part of the 10 commandments \n \n * Used only a few times only in the entire Torah.\n \n * Never used interchangeably with \"put to death\"\n \n Mahvet (mah - vet): killing (killing a guilty person per court rules and G-d's law)\n \n * Used most often in the Bible associated with court sanctioned punishment\n \n * These sins do not necessarily result in spiritual death, as repentance can mitigate the heavenly decree to eradicate the soul (the ultimate divorce from G-d); after 11 months the soul can enter Eden. \n \n * Num. 15:35: \"Ado-shem kel Moshe, mos yu-maht...\" means \" G-d said to Moses, the man shall be put to death...\". \"Maht\" is a root derivative of \"mahvet\". Interestingly this line pertains to violating the Sabbath and does not necessarily mean spiritual death.\n \n * Never used interchangeably with Karet.\n \n Karet (kar - et): spiritual, and sometimes physical, killing of guilty person and soul per G-d's law; heavenly eradication of the entire soul (neshamah) that disallows resurrection. \n \n * \"Cut from the people\" in Hebrew culture means both physical and heavenly removal of the body and soul, from the earth and in heaven (bodies do not reside in heaven)\n \n * Used a few times in association with sins that always require spiritual excision (no resurrection) by G-d in heaven (e.g.. idolatry); assumes no amount of repentance can save the soul; soul is eliminated; no return.\n \n * Num. 15:30\" \"ti-karet ha-nefesh\" - \"that person (animal soul) will surely be cut off\". The use of the term \"nefesh\" (animal soul) instead of the higher order soul (neshamah) indicates that which is closest to the physical body and its drives - it means kill the body and the soul will be cut off in heaven as well.\n \n * Ex. 12:15: \"...ah-kel cho-metz ve-ni-karet- tah ha-nefesh\" means \"eats unleavened bread that soul (nefesh, not nashamah) shall be cut off\". This states that the soul will be cut off in heaven (i.e., no resurrection) and may imply an early death or a normal death in old age with no children born to the person, but no death via the court.\n \n However a book translates these 3 words, the meaning is not to be altered as G-d rendered the Bible in the holy tongue of Hebrew using 3 different words with 3 different meanings, with nuances English lacks or interpreters err when trying to make comprehensible. The lesson here is that a written book, without an Oral Tradition is easily misunderstood and misapplied.\n \n The use of Hebrew scripture in Christainity creates all kinds of difficulties. To supercessionist Chrisitians the NT replaces the Torah (OT). To egalitarian Christians, the Torah and the NT reside side by side, both valid for either people, or both peoples. Christianity, therefore, may decide to believe that capitol punishment is not what G-d wants of Gentiles, but cannot authoritatively say G-d meant that in the Torah for Jews. Logically, some can say at most that the New Testament changed what G-d meant for Christians only (since the NT does not apply to Jews - see references to G-d saying the Torah is the eternal law for the Jews, G-d does not lie or lack foresight), leaving intact the law and commandment by G-d to kill for application by the Jews. Also, in Deut. 13:1, G-d says, \"The entire word that I command you, that you shall observe to do; you shall not add to it and you shall not subtract from it\". Since the Torah is eternal, this clause precludes the NT from overriding the Torah\n \n \n I think that makes it pretty clear. Jesus was a Jew, and the Jews believed in the death penalty. I believe you had to have 2 witnesses to the crime in order for the death penalty. \n \n I like that story about Jesus and the woman who was to be stoned too. The men were accusing her of adultery, which could have meant that she was either accused of having slept with another woman's husband, or that she had been sexually active with a partner outside of marriage. In those days, they did not stone prostitutes. They did stone adulterers. When Jesus said that whoever was without sin should cast the first stone, that made quite a statement. The biggest statement was to follow, however. \"Go and sin no more.\" \n \n So, was Jesus in favor of the death penalty? I don't know. He seemed willing enough to lay down his life so that nobody else would have to die. In doing that, it sounds to me as if He did believe in the death penalty. He had to, or he wouldn't have felt it was necessary to die in our place.",

   "That's why I said REWARD GOOD as well as punish evil. Plus, there is a sense in which punishment can be relative. I think the idea of justice is a battle against the contingency of life: we don't want people to be able to benefit from evil, or suffer from doing good. A system to correct people and reform them would be utilitarian: the aim is to maximise happiness, not to be just. If justice was about reform, no-one would have to be punished as God could reform and then wipe the slate clean.\n \n It's an arbitary principle. And at any given time someone has sinned but not died, which implies the punishment doesn't have to be served instantly. By putting it in a rock we can put it off indefinitely.\n\n it seems as though your concept of ideal justice necessitates punishment immediately. if this is the case, then justice isnt all that ideal. what about repentance? wouldnt it be better to have a system where more emphasis is put on corretion than execution?\n \n \nBut why? \n\n i'll try to explain. god's nature is that of holiness. therefore god is intolerant of sin. thats basically it...\n \n \nThen God shouldn't have declared that in the first place - it's obviously just going to cause trouble. In any case, he didn't say that the penalty for sin is death, he said the penalty for one particular action which Adam couldn't even know was wrong, being unaware of good and evil, was death. Different kettle of fish.\n\n dont you see that god created a system in which the death penalty can remain in force without the individual himself having to die? because jesus already died under the death penalty principle, people who are guilty of sin today have the option of accepting jesus' death on their behalf, and therefore effectively removing their sins as though the penalty was paid. in this way, god was right to declare the death penalty for sin, and does not go back on his word, while man can take advantage of the death penalty principle to have their sins forgiven with the shedding of more blood. i dont see how you think this is a bad thing\n \n \nBut you said earlier that we had a chance to know Jesus face to face and thus confess, and it wasn't just guessing the right religion.\n\n i did? i said tat people who were around to talk to jesus face to face could at that point lay their sins upon him, as they would a scapegoat or sacrificial lamb, and be forgiven before he died. \n \n \nAh. You should have told me you were working on Pratchettian metaphysics. That makes everything make a lot more sense.\n\n i looked up the term, which refers to some books that pratchet wrote. i suppose you are referring to the idea that the human mind can shape the fabric of the spiritual realm, but i couldnt see the relationship from the book reports i got when i googled the term. any more in-depth links?\n \n the idea of the mind being able to manifest itself into \"spiritual reality\" is a very old and common idea. there is a document called \"the science of geting rich\" that is based completely upon the concept. quite a number of motivational programs also promote this idea in some form or another.\n \n basically, the spiritual realm is nothing more than a plane that your mind can conjure and visit. the more you believe in the reality of this plane, the more impact it has on your physical life. each person can individually create his personal spiritual realm and allow it to manifest into his physical life based on how convinced he is that his plane is real. perhaps this is a bit off topic...",

   "of course jesus was for the death penalty. long before any legal system was in place, death was the penatly for sin. the concept of crime didnt even exist at the time. in fact, the mere fact that everbody dies (including animals and plants) is proof that sin has contaminated the planet and god's system of justice works\n \n now, where jesus comes into the picture is that he was sinless. as the only sinless living thing on earth, jesus did not have the death penalty hanging over his head, and was pretty much indestructible (like god is). however, because his love for mankind moved him with compassion, he chose to make himself \"killable\", even though he never sinned. so he allowed himself to pay the penalty for sins he never commited (the death penalty), and... he died!\n \n so to answer your question: yes. not only is jesus for the death penalty, he invented it. and no, he was not guilty, but he pleaded guilty anyway\n \n\n \n That is not exactly true. There is written law going 2500+ years back and death penalty was not the most common punishment used. It was used only for specific crimes, while the most common practice was eye for an eye doctrine. At least until the time of the Roman Empire and their law.\n Lol, read your Bible more carefully next time. I don't know it in detail but well enough that I know your words are full of BS.",
