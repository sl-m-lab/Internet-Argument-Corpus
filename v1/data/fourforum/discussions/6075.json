Resurrecting a six year old thread simply to suggest that the lack of this ludicrous law is the reason Loughner was able to do what he did?\n \n \nDo I hear some people saying Oops?\n\n \n I've covered it in numerous threads that the ludicrous law you hold up as a shining example of effectiveness would've done nothing to prevent the Tuscon shooting from taking place. I've cited the law itself numerous times, but you don't seem interested in the facts. Observe:\n \n Bill Text - 103rd Congress (1993-1994) - THOMAS (Library of Congress)\n \n (a) PROHIBITION- Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by section 110102(a), is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n \n `(w)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.\n \n `(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.\n \n It says right there that the law didn't apply to previously manufactured and possessed magazines that would legally be recognized as \"high capacity\" in nature. That means Loughner could have found and purchased a pre-ban magazine of whatever size he wanted, it just would've been expensive to do.
