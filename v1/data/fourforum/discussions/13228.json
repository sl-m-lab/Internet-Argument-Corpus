   "Gunmen Kill 17 in Mexico Drug Rehab Massacre\n Thursday, September 03, 2009 \n \n CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico - Gunmen broke into a drug rehabilitation center and shot 17 people dead in a northern Mexican border city, an official said.\n \n The attackers on Wednesday broke down the door of El Aliviane center in Ciudad Juarez, lined up their victims against a wall and opened fire, said Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the regional prosecutors' office. At least five people were injured.\n \n Authorities had no immediate suspects or information on the victims. Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, is Mexico's most violent city, with at least 1,400 people killed this year alone. Most of the homicides are tied to drug gang violence.\n \n Dozens of sobbing relatives rushed to the center to find out if their loved ones were among the dead. Soldiers and federal agents patrolled the streets surrounding the center in the Bellavista neighborhood.\n \n President Felipe Calderon sent thousands more troops and federal police to Ciudad Juarez earlier this year, but the surge has done little to stem the raging violence. The city is home to the Juarez drug cartel, which is battling other gangs for trafficking and dealing turf.\n \n The government is struggling to revamp Ciudad Juarez's police force, which is plagued by corruption and the assassination of many of its officers. Other police have quit the force out of fear of being targeted.\n \n The massacre capped a particularly bloody day in Mexico's relentless drug war.\n \n Gunmen killed the No. 2 security official and three other people in Calderon's home state of Michoacan, where the government is locked in an intensifying battle with the ruthless La Familia cartel, blamed for a string of assassinations of police and soldiers.\n \n Jose Manuel Revuelta, who was promoted less than two weeks ago to state deputy public safety director, is the highest-ranking government official killed in the wave of assassinations sweeping Michoacan, the cradle of La Familia drug cartel.\n \n Attackers drove up alongside Revuelta as he headed home and opened fire, state Attorney General Jesus Montejano said.\n \n Revuelta tried to speed away, but only made it a few blocks before he was intercepted by two vehicles. Six gunmen got out and sprayed Revuelta's car with bullets, killing him, two bodyguards and a truck driver caught in the crossfire, Montejano said.\n \n An AP reporter at the scene saw the bodies of Revuelta and his bodyguards in the car, which had at least 15 bullet holes in the front windshield. Soldiers and federal police rushed to the site - just three blocks from the headquarters of the Michoacan Public Safety Department - and a helicopter circled overhead.\n \n Soldiers and federal police have intensified their fight against La Familia since accusing the cartel of killing 18 federal agents and two soldiers last month. In the worst attack, 12 federal agents were slain and their tortured bodies piled along a roadside as a warning.\n \n It was the boldest cartel attack yet on Mexico's government. Authorities said say La Familia was retaliating for the arrest of one of its top members.\n \n The government has since rounded up more La Familia suspects, including Luis Ricardo Magana, who is alleged to have controlled methamphetamine shipments to the United States for the gang. Days before his capture, prosecutors detained the mother of reputed La Familia leader Servando \"La Tuta\" Gomez despite his threat to retaliate if police bothered his family. The woman was released after two days \"for lack of evidence\" of involvement in the cartel.\n \n An AP reporter at the scene saw the bodies of Revuelta and his bodyguards in the car, which had at least 15 bullet holes in the front windshield. Soldiers and federal police rushed to the site - just three blocks from the headquarters of the Michoacan Public Safety Department - and a helicopter circled overhead.\n \n Calderon first launched his crackdown against drug cartels in Michoacan, sending thousands of federal police and soldiers to his home state after taking office in late 2006. Tens of thousands more have since been deployed to drug hotspots across Mexico.\n \n Drug gang violence has since surged, claiming more than 13,500 lives, including more than 1,000 police officers.\n \n Calderon defended his battle against drug trafficking in a speech to Congress on Wednesday. He said the government has taken on the cartels as no previous Mexican administration has dared to do.\n \n \"As never before, we have weakened the logistical and financial structure of crime,\" the president told legislators.\n \n The federal Attorney General's Office, meanwhile, announced the arrest of its two top officials in Quintana Roo, a state on the Yucatan Peninsula, for allegedly protecting the Gulf and the Beltran Levya drug cartels.\n \n Officials provided no further details on the allegations against the prosecutors, who were ordered jailed by a court Wednesday pending the investigation.",

Authorities allege the gun dealer sold more than 650 AK-47-type assault weapons to Mexican drug gangs responsible for recent shootouts that have claimed dozens of lives.\n \n \"He knowingly, willingly sold these weapons, and he even gave our guys undercover tips on how to evade the police,\" Pete Forcelli, the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms supervisor on the case told ABC News. The gun dealer, George Iknadosian, 46, was arrested on numerous Arizona state charges, and all of the inventory in his shop was seized.\n \n \"We know of 650 assault weapons he sold,\" said Forcelli, a former New York Police Department Bronx homicide detective. \"But by the time the case is done, it will be well over a thousand.\"\n \n Authorities in Phoenix, Ariz., told ABC News the raids are part of a continued effort to curb the supply of high-quality weapons from the U.S. to Mexico.\n \n \"Let's be very clear here -- there's a war going on in Mexico right now, and innocent people are being caught in the crossfire, not to mention the hundreds of police officers being murdered,\" said Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' Bill Newell, the special agent in charge of the Phoenix office. \"When 90 percent-plus of the firearms recovered from these violent drug cartels are from a U.S. source, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to stem the illegal flow of these firearms to these thugs.\"",

   "I know nothing of this case other than what I read here and at the links provided. From what I have read, it looks like straw purchasers were prosecuted first and some unlisted number of them agreed to plead guilty and testify against the dealer. It therefore appears clear that the government considered the dealer the greater problem. \n \n The practice of using admitted criminals to prosecute what you believe to be other and greater criminals is a time honored practice I have used many times before in, for example, drug prosecutions. Sometimes you cannot use undercover officers and you have to use civilian witnesses. Now I would love to use the local minister as a witness to prosecute a drug dealer, but dealers won't sell to him. If you want to catch a dealer, then often times you have to use another lower level dealer or a user he feels comfortable enough to sell to. This leads to credibility problems, to which I respond \"If you're going to prosecute the devil then sometimes you have to go to hell to find witnesses.\" \n \n It may be that the \"smuggler\" witnesses in this case were not found to be credible. \n \n From what I read in this case, however, it seems the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that guns from the store ended up in the possession of prohibited persons. An interesting question for me is whether the NY Times-which ran the sting story as a black eye to the gun industry-ever ran a story demonstrating the case was dismissed? \n \n The story does not say whether or not BATFE took action against the FFL dealer's license, but if what he is alleged to have done is true then it is likely BATFE has tried to revoke the license (and it needs to be revoked in my opinion if what is alleged has any truth to it).\n \n My opinion is that gun dealers do not deserve a free pass any more than other people do, and if they intentionally violate the law then they should be prosecuted. Assuming the conduct alleged is true, then at best I find it reprehensible. Whether I would say it was an actual crime or not would depend on knowing what all the evidence presented was and how the criminal statute was worded.",

The survey, conducted by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statics (BJS), indicated that about 689,000 of almost 30 million applications have been rejected by the FBI since the inception of the Act in 1994. \n \n Attorney General John Ashcroft issued the following statement:\n \n \"Today's report shows that while the Brady Law has helped us stop convicted felons and other dangerous individuals from buying guns easily, violations of the law are not being prosecuted adequately. We have now initiated a plan to improve the process of background checks, a plan which will increase prosecutions of those who attempt to purchase guns illegally and improve the accuracy, efficiency and reliability of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). \n \n We want to send the message that 'gun crime means hard time.'
