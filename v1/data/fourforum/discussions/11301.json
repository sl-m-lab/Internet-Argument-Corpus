   "Americans can't pacify themselves with weakening of their power in the world and with all their might are trying to impose their will over other countries. I think it's worth mentioning of the so called American democracy spread in the world and their combating terrorism! But now Americans are trying to kill two birds by one stone: they are trying to divert world's attention from US' atmospheric emissions by accusation that global warming is reason of natural fuel using! Most experts claim it's just bluff! By this way Washington just hopes to weaken traditional energy suppliers and their recipients! Americans are trying to subdue their main rival - China! That's it! Washington is a sly foxy fellow is deviating from troublesome questions and developing the perspective in accordance with US' analysts' opinion directions!",
