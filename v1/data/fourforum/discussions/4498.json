   "U.S.:It is cool to be a SUPERSTATE!\n The United States of America are the only superstate - no one will argue against it. But they do not feel their own power sufficient enough. They snatch control of International institutions and make them into their foreign controlling elements. Let us take for an example International Atomic Energy Agency. The Americans cannot make up their minds to the fact that IAEA hampers the U.S. as their try to intimidate Iran and other states that in their turn deny the arguments of Washington concerning nuclear weapon programs they are presumably running. As for the very United States, they reserve the right not only to develop new types of nuclear weapon, to run the tests and to sell nuclear weapon to other states (some facts show, that the U.S. are in an intention to sell nuclear weapon to Japan and Taiwan) but also to use it at warfare. Nowadays nobody gets surprised with the fact that the U.S. were using depleted uranium shells during the warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq. Make matters worse, the U.S. are intending to use nuclear weapon in the war conflicts they are provoking. All that is allowable for the U.S. as long as they block the adoption of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. But while they are blocking it, they are trying to achieve new advances. Specifically, they do their best not to let the IAEA Secretary General Muhammad al-Baradei to get re-elected (though the very Washington acknowledges that there is hardly anyone who is more competent in this sphere). Seeing no legitimate ways to settle the question, the U.S. State Department made an attempt (with the suggestion of its new Chef Condoleezza Rice) to discredit al-Baradei. He is imputed of financial crimes that make it impossible for al-Baradei to stay the IAEA Secretary General. The related documents have already been manufactured and soon we will witness a one more dirty machination (this method seems to be the major one that the Department of Foreign Affairs is using in the current moment to carry on its foreign politics).",
