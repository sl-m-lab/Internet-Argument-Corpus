Waxman Mulls Probes of Bush Administration\n \n \n \nThe lawmaker poised to cause the Bush administration's biggest headaches when Democrats take control of Congress may just be a grocer's son from Watts who's hardly a household name off Capitol Hill.\n Rep. Henry Waxman has spent the last six years waging a guerrilla campaign against the White House and its corporate allies, launching searing investigations into everything from military contracts to Medicare prices from his perch on the Government Reform Committee.\n In January, Waxman becomes committee chairman - and thus the lead congressional hound of an administration many Democrats feel has blundered badly as it expanded the power of the executive branch.\n Waxman's biggest challenge as he mulls what to probe?\n \"The most difficult thing will be to pick and choose,\" he said.\n The choices he makes could help define Bush's legacy.\n \"There is just no question that life is going to be different for the administration,\" said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., the current committee chairman. \"Henry is going to be tough. . . . And he's been waiting a long time to be able to do this.\"\n Waxman, 67, is in his 16th term representing a Los Angeles district that has migrated west over the years to take in some of the country's most exclusive real estate: Bel Air, Malibu, Beverly Hills. It's worlds from the apartment he grew up in over his father's grocery store, in a predominantly black neighborhood where, he said, \"There was one other Jewish kid - my sister.\"\n The glitz of his district hasn't rubbed off. He remarks wryly that Malibu's celebrity beach-access disputes are, luckily, not a federal issue. And he's never been to the Oscars.\n At first he wasn't invited, and now, \"I have this reputation of never having gone.\" Why ruin it?\n Balding, and quiet-spoken, with glasses, a snub-nose and a mustache, the 5-foot-5-inch Waxman isn't an in-your-face political bruiser. But he doesn't shrink from a fight.\n At age 28 he challenged and beat a Democratic incumbent to win a seat in the state Assembly. Once in Congress, he muscled aside a more senior lawmaker to become chairman of an Energy and Commerce subcommittee, using the post to summon the heads of big tobacco to the famous 1994 hearing, depicted in the movie \"The Insider,\" at which they testified that nicotine wasn't addictive.\n \"One of the biggest miscalculations of corporate America,\" Waxman now calls that.\n Waxman also protected and strengthened the Clean Air Act, expanded Medicaid coverage for poor children and wrote a landmark AIDS care bill. Then Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994.\n The minority party in the House has few rights, and Democrats have complained that GOP leaders completely shut them out from writing legislation.\n So, Waxman said, \"I recreated myself as an investigator.\"\n he makeover was a success.\n \n \n \n When he became top Democrat of the Government Reform Committee in 1997, Waxman realized that he didn't have to settle for playing defense like most in the House minority. He took advantage of the committee's large staff to hire talented investigators to pursue projects large and small.\n His targets have ranged from why the Taekwondo Union was allowing 12- and 13-year-olds to kick opponents in the head, to Medicare drug costs and baseball steroid use, to abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib and government contracts given to Vice President Dick Cheney's former company, Halliburton.\n After agitating by Waxman, the State Department had to revise a report claiming terrorism had decreased in 2003, to reflect that it actually had increased.\n Waxman found overbilling on Katrina contracts and overbilling by Halliburton in Iraq. He revealed that seniors wouldn't really save on premiums by switching to the government's Medicare drug plan. With Davis, he issued a report documenting extensive contacts between the White House and convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff. The Taekwondo Union agreed to prohibit head kicks by anyone under 14.\n And when Bush administration resistance meant he didn't get results, Waxman got headlines for trying.\n As Government Reform chairman, Waxman will aim to reassert congressional checks on the executive branch. A priority are government contracts: for Hurricane Katrina cleanup, homeland security and the Iraq war.\n Contrary to Republican portrayals, Waxman said he doesn't plan to issue scattershot subpoenas. He said he has little interest in revisiting Bush administration failures that are already well known, such as Iraq war intelligence.\n He wants to do it all with the help of Republicans.\n\n Let the witchhunt begin!!!\n \n \n\"We want to return to civility and bipartisanship,\" Waxman said. \"Legislation ought to be based on evidence, not ideology\n\n \n Yeah, riiigghht! emoticon_rolleyes",

If anything, that would produce lower death numbers taken from family elders and spokespersons. Which is the reason many statisticians consider the numbers low. \n \n What specific flaws and which statisticians who reviewed the survey and disagreed with the methodology are you referring to?\n\n I'll address the technical aspects in depth when I have more time. In the meantime, for the John Hopkins and Lancet surveys::\n \n\n The mortality survey used well-established and scientifically proven methods for measuring mortality and disease in populations. These same survey methods were used to measure mortality during conflicts in the Congo, Kosovo, Sudan and other regions. For the Iraq study, data were collected from 47 randomly selected clusters of 40 households each. At each household selected, trained Iraqi surveyors collected data on the number of births and deaths that occurred in the household between January 1, 2002, and June 30, 2006. To be considered a household member, the deceased had to have lived in the home at least three months prior to death. When interviewers asked to see a death certificate at households reporting a death, it was presented in 92 percent of instances. The survey recorded 1,474 births and 629 deaths among 12,801 people surveyed. The data were then applied to the 26.1 million Iraqis living in the survey area.\n \n While the survey collected information on the manner of death, the study did not examine the circumstances of the death, such as whether the deceased was actively involved in armed combat, terrorism, criminal activity or caught in the middle of the conflict. The study outlines other limitations of the survey method, including the hazards of collecting data during a conflict.\n \n The results from the new study closely match the finding of the group's October 2004 mortality survey. The earlier study, also published in The Lancet, estimated over 100,000 additional deaths from all causes had occurred in Iraq from March 2003 to August 2004. When data from the new study were examined, it estimated 112,000 deaths for the same time period of the 2004 study. The new survey also found that the number of deaths attributed to coalition forces had declined in 2006, though overall households attributed 31 percent of deaths to the coalition. Responsibility could not be attributed in 45 percent of the violent deaths. \n\n http://www.jhsph.edu/publichealthnews/press_releases/2006/burnham_iraq_2006.html\n [/quote]\n Let's assume that the numbers are accurate and do a little mathematical masterbation.\n \n Using their 2004 statistics, 31% of 100,000 = 31,000 total death attributable to coalition forces between March 03 and August 04. In a 4.5 year period, this would be <100,000 total deaths.\n The difference between the first Lancet Survey and the new study gives a discrepancy of up to 12,000/1.5year timespan. That's 36,000 deaths out of a total calculated death count of ~100,000, dropping that number to 64,000 over a 4.5 year period. That's 64,000 total Iraqis dead due to coalition forces for all circumstances \"the study did not examine the circumstances of the death, such as whether the deceased was actively involved in armed combat, terrorism, criminal activity or caught in the middle of the conflict.\"\n \n That's a far cry from the !/2 million to 600k statistics bantied about by liberals. emoticon_rolleyes",

They used household interviews and were afraid to go back to those same houses again because they feared for their lives. That omission skewed the entire study's value.\n\n \n Which way would it skew it?\n I gave the reference you requested here, and there is a link to the original article in that post.\n \n I believe the methods were statistically sound.\n \n Here is the article's discussion of the possible limitations of this method:\n \n \nAll surveys have potential for error and bias. The extreme insecurity during this survey could have introduced bias by restricting the size of teams, the number of supervisors, and the length of time that could be prudently spent in all locations, which in turn affected the size and nature of questionnaires. Further, calling back to households not available on the initial visit was felt to be too dangerous. Families, especially in households with combatants killed, could have hidden deaths. Under-reporting of infant deaths is a wide-spread concern in surveys of this type.29 and 30 Entire households could have been killed, leading to a survivor bias. The population data used for cluster selection were at least 2 years old, and if populations subsequently migrated from areas of high mortality to those with low mortality, the sample might have over-represented the high-mortality areas. The miscommunication that resulted in no clusters being interviewed in Duhuk and Muthanna resulted in our assuming that no excess deaths occurred in those provinces (with 5% of the population), which probably resulted in an underestimate of total deaths. Families could have reported deaths that did not occur, although this seems unlikely, since most reported deaths could be corroborated with a certificate. However, certificates might not be issued for young children, and in some places death certificates had stopped being issued; our 92% confirmation rate was therefore deemed to be reasonable.\n \n Large-scale migration out of Iraq could affect our death estimates by decreasing population size. Out-migration could introduce inaccuracies if such a process took place predominantly in households with either high or low violent death history. Internal population movement would be less likely to affect results appreciably. However, the number of individual households with in-migration was much the same as those with out-migration in our survey.\n \n Although interviewers used a robust process for identifying clusters, the potential exists for interviewers to be drawn to especially affected houses through conscious or unconscious processes. Although evidence of this bias does not exist, its potential cannot be dismissed. Furthermore, families might have misclassified information about the circumstances of death. Deaths could have been over or under-attributed to coalition forces on a consistent basis. The numbers of non-violent deaths were low, thus, estimation of trends with confidence was difficult. Not sampling two of the Governorates could have underestimated the total number of deaths, although these areas were generally known as low-violence Governorates. Finally, the sex of individuals who had died might not have been accurately reported by households. Female deaths could have been under-reported, or there might have been discomfort felt in reporting certain male deaths.\n \n The striking similarity between the 2004 and 2006 estimates of pre-war mortality diminishes concerns about people's ability to recall deaths accurately over a 4-year period. Likewise, the similar patterns of mortality over time documented in our survey and by other sources corroborate our findings about the trends in mortality over time.\n \n",
