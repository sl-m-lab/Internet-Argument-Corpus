   "Has it ever occured to you, that maybe, your beliefs aren't correct?\n\n \n I've discussed this question with several conservative/fundamentalist Christians who have told me quite candidly that they consider such questions or doubts to be the work of Satan. One such individual explained to me that, if he is engaged in debate with someone over an aspect of his own theology, and if that someone begins to raise serious challenges to his faith, he simply walks away from the discussion because he realizes that he's being confronted by Satan. Moreover, the more serious the challenge, the more convinced he is that he's dealing with Satan. Isn't that a fabulous perspective? \n \n For example, quoting creationist Ken Ham...\n \n The Bible teaches us that Satan is \"a liar, and the father of it\" (John 8:44). This means that Satan is ultimately responsible for the greatest lie of all time being spread throughout world - the lie, which leads people to reject the truth that God created all things. This is the lie of evolution!\n \n This great lie, one of Satan's major weapons, has even deceived many Christians. Many in our churches and Christian colleges have accommodated this lie. Satan has successfully infiltrated the Church as well as the rest of the community, using this false teaching of evolution, and he has captured much territory. ICR is involved in this battle against the forces of evil, as we aggressively go to battle against evolution. \n \n http://www.icr.org/pubs/btg-a/btg-041a.htm",

This doesn't mean \"fleecing\" Him, but putting ourselves into position to receive from Him.\n \n Again, if the Bible were Satan's way to lead us away from God, then the good things of God would never show up. As per the Bible, (Ephesians 6:12) For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.",

   "First of all, I wish (for this discussion's sake) that we could take a minute and allow \"Christian\" to stand for something outside political or religious fields and let it stand for \"One who is Christ-like\". Okay? (I feel the hatred...) I don't define God and won't define Him. He is who He is. Only God is Good and nothing or no one else.\n\n no hate intended. i just want to define which source i was refering to. the christian bible\n \nAnd no, the Bible is not the only source of good, you and I are. We were created with a detector (so to speak) that knows right and wrong, good and evil to some extent. If you don't believe that, then explain why those that have no belief in God know the difference? As we grow we realize it more, see it more, understand it more. Only through God are we able to fully comprehend it and the why of it all.\n\n of course, the next question is: why is it possible for us to have different ideas of right and wrong? you may believe that fornication is wrong, i may not. who's detector is broken? how can we tell?\n \nIs the Bible not the guide to absolute good? Is it not the source?\n\n the question began with the word \"if\". if, for some reason, what the bible declares as \"that which God says is good\" was actually not what God says is good, then is there any other way of determining what good is?\n \nWhen God created earth He did so in order for it to be inhabited. Mankind was to be the dominant species, the set-apart living ones with spirits and souls. But, not just puppets on whose strings were tied the fingers of God. We were created to live as free souls, implanted with the freedom to choose good or evil at will. Since that time we have ignored God's commandments (which, btw, were for our benefit) and have continually chosen evil over good. How can we choose a non-existent state? By refusing that which does exist. That's what God said in Deuteronomy 30: 11 -20 when He encourages us to choose good instead of evil and what the consequences will be if we fail to do so.\n \n So, in that respect, the Bible is the source of absolute good.\n\n so does this answer override your previous answer? we as humans have detectors of good and evil within us, but the bible settles any dispute that may arise in the case of faulty detectors. is that ok?",

   "There's no doubt that evil flourishes in the Bible - I won't argue with that. But why did it when the Bible is all about God? Because without God evil can do whatever it chooses. It can instill fear and doubt in the minds of the strongest of people or even continents. The Bible is not just an example of the good, but also that which happens in the absence of good. Regardless of our pride and preconceived ideas about what is right and wrong, good and evil, the Bible informs us of the truth, guides us through its chapters and verses with one ultimate agenda: God is good (and absolutely so) and wants us, even begs us to choose Him...and life. So many religions have been generated by the Bible, as we all know, that have their own brand of right and wrong, good and evil, but that doesn't mean God told them or gave them the power to abuse it. Because of His love for us, He has given us the freedom to make our own choices. In doing so He has given us the power to refuse Him and His Word if we so choose. In this way we allow evil to take over, and when it does we proclaim that God did it and the Bible promoted it.\n\n \n \n Actually, from what I see, it is the concept of GOD TOLD ME TOO is used as an excuse, and God and the bible was used for jusification. \n \n You have yet to show the case that 'the bible informs us of the truth'.",

   "no hate intended. i just want to define which source i was refering to. the christian bible\n\n No, not on your part, but from others - it's obvious. Trying to break away from that political and religious battlefield is very, very hard to do. It even taints the post sometimes beyond recognition. I was just wishing...I suppose.\n \nof course, the next question is: why is it possible for us to have different ideas of right and wrong? you may believe that fornication is wrong, i may not. who's detector is broken? how can we tell?\n\n Getting \"used to\" doing wrong is one thing; disobeying God's commandment is another. When two people love each other and think that sex outside of marriage is all right, then emotions trump right and wrong. Who are we to say what a piece of paper will do for or against them? Are they not married already in their hearts? If a person can sin in the heart can they not also do good? Who defines a relationship anyway? I stay out of the religious aspect of that, and so should anyone else. John and Mary are poor. They strive each day to find something to eat. They struggle to keep warm in the winter and cool in the summer, but they love each other and have made a commitment to that relationship. Now, are they deemed sinners and damned because of it? I don't see it that way.\n Fornication to me is sex for the hell of it - no commitments, no respect, no hassle, just bump and grind and get gone. I think anyone would see that as just plain wrong.\n \nthe question began with the word \"if\". if, for some reason, what the bible declares as \"that which God says is good\" was actually not what God says is good, then is there any other way of determining what good is?\n\n The way I see it? No. The way the Bible puts it is that we are a special creation; we are not a part of the animal kingdom. In that case we are endowed at birth with certain aspects of God to begin with. During the span of life we hear the Word of God and can choose to accept it or reject it. If we accept it then we are implanted with an incorruptible seed, which is the Holy Spirit. At that time we will see (spiritually) the things of God that will further teach us right and wrong. To me, after I had accepted Him, it was as much difference as night and day. To others that may not be the case. I reckon it depends on their character (spirit-man) before they changed and in what condition their mind (soul) was in to begin with.\n \n I believe there are people today that have more of the Father in them and have never felt Him than some Christians. That's not bashing the Christians, mind ya, just giving credit where it's due.\n \nso does this answer override your previous answer? we as humans have detectors of good and evil within us, but the bible settles any dispute that may arise in the case of faulty detectors. is that ok?\n\n Are you referring to Absolute Good? Or to the perception of good and evil? Which post are you referring to?\n The Bible can only lead us so far. All the words in the Bible, however, cannot take the place of God. It is the Spirit of God in contact with our spirits that settles the dispute when the \"detector\" wears out. Some folks' detectors go bad very soon, btw. Some, such as myself long ago, no longer pay attention to it even if it does work. But that's the fatal flaw in us all, anyway. That's why the only way to the Father is through the Son, who is now our \"detector\" and mediator. Christ was once flesh and knows what it's like.\n If you are referring to humans detecting the perception of good and evil, then no, my answer is in line. But, if you are talking about humans detecting absolute good, then it's altogether different. Once a person accepts God then he can understand and appreciate absolute good; detect its presence, but not before. Actually, it's nonsense to those that don't believe.",

These were not combatants. They were, instead, civilians who were targeted. I later learned that a considerable number of Europeans risked their lives in an attempt to save as many of these folks as possible. The most notable of these efforts came from Sweden, Denmark, and Bulgaria. \n \n I'm convinced that those efforts arose in response to evil as well as the threat of evil.

Suffice it to say that I do not suffer XXXXXX gladly, at this or any other forum. The Swedish diplomat Raul Wallenberg, assigned to Budapest, arranged for the safe departure of thousands of Hungarian Jews via forged passports. He was later taken into custody by the Soviets and never heard from again. I have no idea as to his religious beliefs, nor do I care. What impresses me, however, is that Wallenberg responded to perceived evil. He didn't simply \"clean up\" after it.\n \n I level the same arguments against the Allied bombing of Dresden - another evil act, or of Hiroshima, yet another evil act. \n \n I earlier alluded to the NT parable of the good Samaritan. It's not a perfect analogy to what I stated above, but it's close enough for government work. This story depicts an individual who encountered evil and decided to do something about it. We don't know his motivations, but the story suggests that he did what he did based upon considerations of mercy and compassion, without any thought of reward. This is, in my opinion, one of the most powerful stories told by Jesus of Nazareth, and I consider it to be authentic.",

   "Yes there are times when some people get together to help one another, however, look at the crime rate, look at the type and extent of wars. Would you say that Hitler was better than Ceaser? Was he less cruel? Getting better and better implies that people are safer and more satisified than they were 2000 years ago. All I see are people that want more and more and are not satisfied with what we have. \n \n Look how much we have compared to those two thousand years ago. TV, cell phones, computers, internet, autos, planes, vacation packages, eradication of small pox, great hospitals and libraries, and yet, people are less satisfied. Or at least there is a distinct mentality that what we have is not enough. Advertising caters to this very thing. If we were satisfied then advertising would not work, and there is plenty of evidence that it does work.\n \n You must be kidding (or engaging in wishful thinking) to say that things have gotten progressively better. Don't look just at wars. Look at society as a whole. Take for instance, all the time saving devices that we have. Do you actually have more time than you did twenty years ago. That is what advertising does. It lies to you to make you think things will be better. They aren't better just different.\n \n EF\n\n \n \n So, in the U.S... how has the murder rate gone in the last decade? How about violent crime? How about that total amount of war in the entire world?? Yes, I know Iraq is getting a lot of press, but what about the entire world at a whole? (Hint, it's gone down). \n \n How about the numbers of abortions in this country per capita? Do you have the trend there? How about the trend of 'out of wedlock' pregnancy?? Do you have the numbers?? Look it up.",
