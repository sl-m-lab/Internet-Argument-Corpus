   "Occam's razor states that when you are presented with competing theories (or hypotheses), the one with the fewest assumptions is most likely to be accurate.\n \n This makes sense, and I will provide an example to show this. Consider: if you found a dead animal on the road, it is more likely that a car hit it than that it was killed by an alien spaceship? Both hypotheses assume that the laws of physics apply and that the animal was dead, etc.\n The second hypothesis, though, assumes the existence of aliens, contact with aliens, and that a spaceship came down in the correct spot to hit this animal.\n Obviously, the first hypothesis is more likely.\n \n Moving on...\n Plasticity will be my next example. A hypothesis has recently been presented (by supersport) that states that organisms adapt entirely through plasticity. This is in direct competition with the theory that organisms adapt through natural selection.\n First, plasticity is the extent to which an organism's phenotype (observable traits, such as size) is determined by its genotype (genetic information).\n One example is that all bees have the same genetic information, but bees that would be workers can instead become queens when treated with \"royal jelly\". Also, some animals can respond to common predators (for example, the snail Littorina obtusata responds to certain crabs by developing a thicker shell). Because of plasticity, animals can respond to a change in the environment immediately, but this does not represent a change in genotype. This means that plasticity does not change DNA.\n Supersport's plasticity hypothesis assumes that organisms were given a DNA sequence that allowed them to adapt to all challenges that they ever faced, giving us the fossil record as we know it. It also assumes that DNA does not vary, just the traits of organisms (by the definition of plasticity). Therefore, this hypothesis assumes that DNA has never changed.\n The theory of evolution, however, assumes that DNA changes, which is a smaller assumption. Supersport's pet hypothesis expects fossilized DNA to be the same as modern DNA or to have been modified. This is a larger assumption than simply assuming that DNA changes and that the fossil record is accurate.\n \n \n Occam's razor can also be applied to claims that a deity created the universe as is.\n This hypothesis assumes: (1) the existence of a deity, and (2) that this deity had the power, energy, and intelligence to create the universe as is.\n The Theory of Evolution does not assume this, and what it does assume is simpler.\n A more complete list of the assumptions is as follows:\n \n A list of assumptions made by the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection:\n 1) Organisms interact with those around them.\n 2) There is variation within a population of organisms (few organisms have the same traits).\n 3) Some organisms are able to survive better.\n 4) Organisms that survive better reproduce more.\n 5) Organisms that reproduce more become a larger percent of the population.\n 6) Because of numbers 2-5, organisms with advantageous traits become a larger percent of the population.\n 7) Life originated as a result of chemical reactions.\n 8) The process detailed above brought organisms to the point they are at today. <MAJOR ASSUMPTION<\n 9) Earth is approximately the age that the evidence points to (~4.8 billion years old).\n \n A list of assumptions made by the Bible (fundamentalist interpretation):\n 1) A deity (God) exists. <MAJOR ASSUMPTION<\n 2) God has/had enough power (energy and methods of application) to create a universe. <MAJOR ASSUMPTION<\n 3) God created the universe and everything inside.\n 4) The universe was created ~6000 years ago.\n 5) God wants everyone to believe in him.\n 6) God planted evidence of a much older earth.\n 7) The Bible (the word of God) is almost completely accurate historically. <MAJOR ASSUMPTION<\n 8) There was a worldwide flood. <MAJOR ASSUMPTION<\n 9) Jesus was the son of God (and part of God).\n 10) The world will end as part of God's plan.\n \n Note: assumptions labeled <MAJOR ASSUMPTION< are complicated enough to count as multiple assumptions. By the way, I did exercise restraint in placing these labels.\n Also, I am willing to defend any of the assumptions and/or labels on the list.\n \n One thing that I know I have to defend now: it could be argued that assuming abiogenesis is a major assumption, based on statistics that would seem to make it impossible for life to have originated by random chance. However, these statistics are inaccurate, as shown here.\n \n What this post explains is that Occam's razor denies the accuracy of the bible because it makes too many assumptions to be more likely than the scientific explanation. Therefore, it is poor logic to accept the bible without further evidence.\n \n \n To finish: why do we go by Occam's razor? It works. See my first example for a reason that we should keep our beliefs uncomplicated whenever possible. If we didn't, we would be swamped with thousands of explanations for very simple events, and most of the explanations would be illogical.\n How do we keep our beliefs straight? We use Occam's razor, whether or not we know it.",

His example was a typical statement of his time: \"A body moves because of an acquired impetus\" vs \"a body moves\".

Therefore, the correct way to describe the phenomenon was \"a body moves\". Leave out \"impetus\" or any other cause entirely.\n \n Now, you can see that this has nothing to do with any \"most likely to be accurate\". \n \n \nThis makes sense, and I will provide an example to show this.

We can just say \"more likely\" and eliminate one of the hypotheses.\n \n Now, the correct Ockham statement for your example is \"this dead animal was struck\". Anything beyond that, whether car or alien spaceship, is unnecessary to describe the phenonmenon you are looking at.\n \n In your plasticity example, Supersport's theory can be tested by looking at contemporary organisms. The theory predicts that all organisms within a \"kind\" will have the same DNA. But that can be tested at whatever level you want to use for \"kind\" and shown to be false. Has been shown to be false by phylogenetic analysis. No application of the mistaken Razor.\n \n \nThe theory of evolution, however, assumes that DNA changes, which is a smaller assumption.

That is, changing DNA is a conclusion or deduction from the theory. As you noted, Supersport's theory predicts DNA from extinct species to be the same as modern DNA. Not modified, because the modification is in the expression of parts of the DNA, not the total package. Well, DNA from mammoths and Neandertals have been tested and it is not the same as modern elephants or humans.\n \n \n \nOccam's razor can also be applied to claims that a deity created the universe as is.\n\n \n Not the correct one. :) \n \n \nThis hypothesis assumes: (1) the existence of a deity, and (2) that this deity had the power, energy, and intelligence to create the universe as is.\n The Theory of Evolution does not assume this, and what it does assume is simpler.\n\n \n Excuse me, but where does evolution talk about the creation of the universe?

Therefore, it is poor logic to accept the bible without further evidence.\n\n \n LOL!\n \n 1. You have a mistaken Ockham's Razor.\n 2. You started out talking about whether God created and are now talking about the accuracy of the bible! Those are not the same things. What is to stop God from creating by the processes discovered by science?\n \n \nTo finish: why do we go by Occam's razor? It works.\n\n \n No, it doesn't. Not the mistaken view you have given, anyway. If you look in the literature for signal transduction or transcription control, you see that your mistaken view of the Razor is completely discarded. \n \n Let me give you a real scientific world example where adherence to the Razor really screwed science:\n \n Bone morphogenetic protein. In 1965 Marshall Urist published a paper in Science describing the phenomena of ectopic bone induction. Urist took bone from one rabbit and demineralized it and then put the deminernalized bone (organic matrix) back under the skin of another rabbit. A new nodule of bone formed at the site. Obviously bone never forms normally under the skin. This is bone induction. Subsequent papers by Urist and others demonstrated the phenomena across several mammalian species and demonstrated that a protein was responsible for the effect. Urist named the as-yet-unpurified protein bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Occam's Razor said that there was one protein. After all, more than one protein would be \"unnecessary\". Reasoning based on evolution also said one protein, since it would be \"confusing\" to have more than one protein direct such a critical biological phenomena.\n \n At least 8 labs were working on the problem simultaneously, and the job took from 1965 until 1990. Everyone could get a partially purified preparation having 3 major bands on gel electrophoresis, but could get no further. Eventually Wozney and Wang's group at Genetics Institute used a brute force approach and got partial amino acid sequences from the 3 bands, got the cDNA sequences, and cloned every possible protein with those sequences. It turns out there are at least 10 BMPs. All of which induce ectopic bone formation. The natural product is actually a heterodimer (one peptide chain from 2 genes) of BMP-2 and BMP-7. So much for Occam's Razor.",

God forbid that science should advance.\n \nAnd you've just killed science! Because you are saying we no longer have to TEST. We can just say \"more likely\" and eliminate one of the hypotheses.\nBullroar. He said no such thing. He stated an hypothesis to be tested by eliminating an unlikely hypothesis.\n \nNow, the correct Ockham statement for your example is \"this dead animal was struck\". Anything beyond that, whether car or alien spaceship, is unnecessary to describe the phenonmenon you are looking at.\nGreat if you are doing what passed for science in 1350. But your scenario presents no hypothesis for testing. As Occam's Razor is applied today, one tests the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions first. Testing for alien intervention comes later when all other hypotheses have failed. I am not aware of any case in which the testing of alien intervention has actually been attempted.\n \nIn your plasticity example, Supersport's theory can be tested by looking at contemporary organisms. The theory predicts that all organisms within a \"kind\" will have the same DNA.\nNo it doesn't. SS's theory predicts that DNA is unpredictable since there is no requirement that some designer entity would be required to abide by some nebulous rule as to the form of DNA.\n \nBut that can be tested at whatever level you want to use for \"kind\" and shown to be false. Has been shown to be false by phylogenetic analysis. No application of the mistaken Razor.\nActually, it hasn't. Phylogenetic analysis has no relevance to Occam's Razor. Further, DNA for all organisms is the same until you examine specific sequences. It isn't that the DNA is different, what matters is the the sequence of the bases is different.\n \nEvolution PREDICTS that DNA changes. Not \"assumes\". But PREDICTS.\nActually, you are living in the past. That DNA changes is neither an assumption nor a prediction. It is an observation.\n \nThat is, changing DNA is a conclusion or deduction from the theory.\nNope.\n \nAs you noted, Supersport's theory predicts DNA from extinct species to be the same as modern DNA.

Well, DNA from mammoths and Neandertals have been tested and it is not the same as modern elephants or humans.\nActually true. But I fail to understand the point. mtDNA from Neandertals seems to indicate that they are not ancestral and did not interbreed with modern humans. Neither are mammoths ancestral to modern elephants. In both cases the evidence indicates that they are related species. What was your point?\n \nNot the correct one. :)\nNot the correct what? Not the 657 year old statement by Ockham or the more modern understanding of the principle?\n \nExcuse me, but where does evolution talk about the creation of the universe? The theory of evolution deals ONLY with the origin of the diversity of life we see on the planet. There are other theories that deal with the origin of the universe.\nHoly Jesus! Don't get your panties in a wad. Creationists include the origin of the universe, the earth and everything else in what the call \"the evolution theory.\" I would have expected that you would have understood that if you were actually aware of the issues being discussed.\n \nI suggest reading either Origin of Species or Mayr's What Evolution Is so that you can get natural selection and evolution correct. The above has several errors.\nI would suggest that you re-read the suggested texts. Let me restate: 1) All organisms produce so many offspring that their numbers would increase exponentially without constraint. Yet adult populations remain reletively constant.\n \n 2) In any environment there is a limited amount of resources insufficient to support the exponential increase of reproduction. As a result, there is a constant competition to acquire the limited resourses in order to survive (for a clue: to reproduce - anything else is irrelevant).\n \n 3) There exists in any population genetic variability such that no two individuals are the same. This variability lends a statistical advantage that certain charisteristics will have an advantage in acquiring the available resources in order to survive to reproduce.\n \n 4) As a result, advantageous characteristics will tend to increase in a given environment, while less advantageiou characteristics will tend to decrease.\n \n Please point out the errors in this simple summary.\n \nToo bad, because we've already seen that you don't know the difference between \"assumption\" and \"prediction\" or \"deduction\". Also, some of the \"assumptions\" ou listed are actually \"data\".\nYou haven't shown that you know the difference. It is especially suspect since you insist on 657 year old interpretations of scientific statement. Somewhat akin to the dogmatic assertions of fundamentalists.

How do you know your interpretation is better?\n Oh, right, it has to assume less to explain the facts.\n Sound familiar?\n \nExcuse me, but where does evolution talk about the creation of the universe? The theory of evolution deals ONLY with the origin of the diversity of life we see on the planet. There are other theories that deal with the origin of the universe.\n\n I'm talking about \"evolution\" as defined by creationists. That includes abiogenesis and the big bang. I have attempted to show that these theories require fewer assumptions and are therefore more likely to be right.\n \nI suggest reading either Origin of Species or Mayr's What Evolution Is so that you can get natural selection and evolution correct. The above has several errors.\n\n I am willing to challenge you to name them. I do not believe you can.\n \nToo bad, because we've already seen that you don't know the difference between \"assumption\" and \"prediction\" or \"deduction\". Also, some of the \"assumptions\" you listed are actually \"data\".\n\n Data, facts, and assumptions... When I wrote that post, I attempted to head off accusations of bais from creationists. I personally would classify evolution and natural selection as facts, but they wouldn't.\n \nLOL!\n \n 1. You have a mistaken Ockham's Razor.\n\n Really? Except for that one point, I believe I got it entirely right.\n \n2. You started out talking about whether God created and are now talking about the accuracy of the bible! Those are not the same things. What is to stop God from creating by the processes discovered by science?\n\n Nothing. This post was directed at fundamentalists, so I didn't take theistic evolution's interpretation into account.\n However, I did state \"Occam's razor can also be applied to claims that a deity created the universe as is.\"\n \nNo, it doesn't. Not the mistaken view you have given, anyway. If you look in the literature for signal transduction or transcription control, you see that your mistaken view of the Razor is completely discarded. \n\n Because of that one omitted phrase?\n \nLet me give you a real scientific world example where adherence to the Razor really screwed science:\n \n Bone morphogenetic protein. In 1965 Marshall Urist published a paper in Science describing the phenomena of ectopic bone induction. Urist took bone from one rabbit and demineralized it and then put the deminernalized bone (organic matrix) back under the skin of another rabbit. A new nodule of bone formed at the site. Obviously bone never forms normally under the skin. This is bone induction. Subsequent papers by Urist and others demonstrated the phenomena across several mammalian species and demonstrated that a protein was responsible for the effect. Urist named the as-yet-unpurified protein bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Occam's Razor said that there was one protein. After all, more than one protein would be \"unnecessary\". Reasoning based on evolution also said one protein, since it would be \"confusing\" to have more than one protein direct such a critical biological phenomena.\n \n At least 8 labs were working on the problem simultaneously, and the job took from 1965 until 1990. Everyone could get a partially purified preparation having 3 major bands on gel electrophoresis, but could get no further. Eventually Wozney and Wang's group at Genetics Institute used a brute force approach and got partial amino acid sequences from the 3 bands, got the cDNA sequences, and cloned every possible protein with those sequences. It turns out there are at least 10 BMPs. All of which induce ectopic bone formation. The natural product is actually a heterodimer (one peptide chain from 2 genes) of BMP-2 and BMP-7. So much for Occam's Razor.\n\n With incomplete information, Occam's razor is useful to find the most likely conclusion. If more information is found, the same conclusion may not be the most likely. This is a \"real scientific world example\" of why the phrase \"most likely\" is important.\n \n1. If you have a \"body of knowledge\" to refute a position, then Ockam's Razor is irrelevant. You've finally shown a glimmer of knowledge: ideas are refuted by DATA, not philosophy or logic. \n\n A body of knowledge can force hypotheses to make additional assumptions. People usually choose the simpler hypothesis because of the principles of Occam's razor.\n \n2. You started off trying to show God did not create. But now you are talking about \"the fundamentalist interpretation of the bible\". Those are 2 different things. And you can't link them.\n\n I meant the second. Did you notice the words, \"as is?\"\n \n3. The Bible has at least 3 stories of how the universe began. That's one sure tipoff that the Fundie interpretation is wrong.\n\n Actually, it is a tip-off that they need to pick one interpretation or confuse their position by trying to assume all three.\n \nSo, you have NOT shown that God does not exist or that God did not create. What has been shown -- by Christians long before you came along -- that a literal interpretation of Genesis 1-3 is the wrong interpretation. That is what the second quote in my signature refers to. Notice the date.\n\n I know that. It was not my intention to show that a deity does not exist; I wanted to refute the fundamentalist interpretation (again).",

   "I fail to see how this tidbit is relevant, or even how it is contrary to Occam's Razor.\n\n \n Because it shows that Ockham was arguing against what Hi_Its_Me says the Razor is.\n \n \nNo he didn't. He said, \"entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem.\" That means, \"entities should not be multiplied beyond what is necessary.\" Since you seem to want to be so literal in your first statement, shouldn't you be at least as literal in all statements?\n\n \n No, because that quote is out of context. Which entities? You need the context of Ockham's work to understand what he was saying. \n \n \n Relevance?\n\n \n It should be obvious. Nowhere in there is there a testing of hypotheses or saying what is \"most likely\".\n \n \nAh! I see now. You are clinging to what Ockham said some 657 years ago rather than what it has come to mean in the 279 years since Newton died and the 147 years since the publication of \"On the Origin of Species.\" That's good. God forbid that science should advance.\n\n \n If you are going to invoke Ockham then you need to say what he actually said, not a mistake. This is about the accuracy of the idea. If I am going to invoke Darwin on natural selection, then I need to use the full description of natural selection and not just \"survival of the fittest\" and try to make NS a tautology. In this case, the \"advance\" has led to an incorrect idea. \n \n If you want to discuss the new idea that \"the simplest explanation is most likely correct\", then I did that in my example of BMP. That idea is wrong.\n \n \n He said no such thing. He stated an hypothesis to be tested by eliminating an unlikely hypothesis.\n\n \n Where did he eliminate the alien spaceship hypothesis by testing. He didn't. He \"eliminated\" it by fiat and assertion. Not by data. That's not how you do science.\n \n \nGreat if you are doing what passed for science in 1350. But your scenario presents no hypothesis for testing. As Occam's Razor is applied today, one tests the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions first. \n\n \n But the point is that the Razor should not be used to test hypotheses! That isn't what Ockham stated the Razor as. The whole point is that you can't use this warped version of the Razor for hypothesis testing. In the example, impetus was a hypothesis for a cause for movement. Ockham eliminated the hypothesis as a description of the phenonmenon.\n \n The Razor states that the animal was struck. Period. From that observations you make hypotheses as to what struck the animal. Hi_Its_Me listed only 2 of the possible hypotheses. Then, without testing either hyopothesis, he eliminated one as \"unlikely\" and used \"unlikely\" to = false. But there was not testing. Yet testing is not only possible but easy. Last year my daughter's car hit a deer. The deer's carcass wasn't found but it would have had pieces of glass embedded in it. Testing those pieces would show that they came from the windshield of a Pontiac Sunfire. That eliminates the alien spaceship hypothesis. (Unless you propose the ad hoc hypothesis that the spaceship coincidentally had glass identical to that of a Pontiace Sunfire. However, that ad hoc hypothesis can't be independently tested and is therefore invalid). \n \n \n SS's theory predicts that DNA is unpredictable since there is no requirement that some designer entity would be required to abide by some nebulous rule as to the form of DNA. \n\n \n But SS would say that neandertals are humans, right? All creationists I have seen say that. Just put neandertals in modern clothes and you would not notice them on a city street. So their DNA should be identical to H. sapien's by that theory.\n \n \n Phylogenetic analysis has no relevance to Occam's Razor.\n\n \n I didn't relate it to Ockham's Razor. I related it to SS's theory. Please read more carefully.\n \n \n Further, DNA for all organisms is the same until you examine specific sequences. It isn't that the DNA is different, what matters is the the sequence of the bases is different.\n\n \n Uh, what do you think we are talking about? You mean that all DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid? DUH! Or that all organisms use the same bases? No. SS's theory only makes sense in terms of DNA sequences.\n \n \nActually, you are living in the past. That DNA changes is neither an assumption nor a prediction. It is an observation.\n\n \n LOL! What is a \"prediction\" in science? It is data/observations we should find if the theory is true. An assumption is something we think is true without evidence. So, DNA changes are a prediction of evolution. That we have actually found the prediction to be true -- seen the observations -- provides strong support for evolution. \n \n \nNope.\n\n \n Yep. When Mendelian genetics were incorporated into evolution to make the Modern Synthesis, the deduction from the Modern Synthesis was that DNA sequences should change -- different alleles. Our observations simply mean the deduction is confirmed.\n \n You do understand deductive logic and that it is the basis of theory evaluation, right? Maybe not.\n \n \nActually true. But I fail to understand the point. mtDNA from Neandertals seems to indicate that they are not ancestral and did not interbreed with modern humans. Neither are mammoths ancestral to modern elephants. In both cases the evidence indicates that they are related species. What was your point?\n\n \n The point is that the data falsifies SS's theory. Since neandertals are humans -- in creationism -- then by SS's theory their DNA sequences should be the same as ours. SS's theory is that there is a difference in which genes are activated, not that the sequences differ. Well, the sequences differ. THerefore, by deductive logic, SS's theory must be false.\n \n You don't use comparative number of entities to evaluate theories: you use data.\n \n \n Not the correct what? Not the 657 year old statement by Ockham or the more modern understanding of the principle?\n\n \n The modern misstatement of the Razor is incorrect. \n \n \nHoly Jesus! Don't get your panties in a wad. Creationists include the origin of the universe, the earth and everything else in what the call \"the evolution theory.\"\n\n \n Yes, they do. So why should you make the same mistake? We correct creationists about this mistake all the time on other boards. See talkorigins debate board. That Hi_Its_Me went along with the mistake showed that he was no longer discussing evolution or even science, but arguing atheism vs theism.\n \n The reason we do this is because science and evolution are not atheism and scientific theories have boundaries. No scientific theory gives a worldview or an explanation of everything. Even the anticipated \"theory of everything\" combining Relativity and QM won't explain everything. Evolution has the boundary of the first life. It assumes that a universe and living organisms exist. Just like Cell Theory assumes the same things. If you want to discuss the origin of the first life, then you have to talk about the various theories within the field of abiogenesis. If you want to talk about the origin of the universe, then you need to discuss the various theories within the field of cosmology.\n \n \n I would suggest that you re-read the suggested texts. Let me restate: 1) All organisms produce so many offspring that their numbers would increase exponentially without constraint. Yet adult populations remain reletively constant.\n\n \n And that's an observation, isn't it? Not an assumption. Calling it an assumption was the mistake. Darwin devotes a whole chapter to this.\n \n \n2) In any environment there is a limited amount of resources insufficient to support the exponential increase of reproduction. As a result, there is a constant competition to acquire the limited resourses in order to survive (for a clue: to reproduce - anything else is irrelevant).\n\n \n Again, is that an assumption like Hi_Its_Me labeled it?\n \n \n3) There exists in any population genetic variability such that no two individuals are the same. This variability lends a statistical advantage that certain charisteristics will have an advantage in acquiring the available resources in order to survive to reproduce.\n\n \n Observation or assumption? What did Hi_Its_Me label it?\n \n \n4) As a result, advantageous characteristics will tend to increase in a given environment, while less advantageiou characteristics will tend to decrease.\n\n \n Is your summary the same as Hi_Its_Me's? No. Yours is very good. It's practically a restatement of Darwin's summary of natural selection. But it's not what Hi_Its_Me said, is it?\n \n \nYou haven't shown that you know the difference. It is especially suspect since you insist on 657 year old interpretations of scientific statement.\n\n \n If you invoke Ockham's Razor, then you must invoke the correct form of it, not the changed form. Especially when the changed form is wrong and contradicts the original form.\n \n Now, what you try to dismiss as \"fundamentalist stuff\" isn't. You won't find it in any creationist literature. Because there is nothing in it to support creationism. It's straight science from the scientific literature. It is data that refutes the warped version of the Razor, however. But you can't dismiss data by calling it \"fundamentalist stuff\". That you tried simply shows that you can't answer the argument and data. \n \n If this were a real debate, instead of a discussion, you would lose points on that.",

   "Sorry- a better statement would say \"Occam's razor states that when you are presented with competing theories (or hypotheses) that explain the facts equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions is most likely to be accurate.\"\n I did do research, and I know what I am talking about.\n\n \n With respect, in this case your research did not extend far enough. Yes, if you do web searches, this is what you will often find stated as the Razor. My point is that this statement is wrong! It's opposite of what William of Ockham stated and, what's worse, it is not how science is done. It's actually harmful to science.\n \n Your research needs to extend to a philosophy of science textbook. One that does the history of the philosophy of science. Three such textbooks are:\n The Arch of Knowledge by David Oldroyd\n A Historical Introduction to the Philosophy of Science 4th Ed. by John Losee\n Philosophy of Science, The Central Issues edited by Martin Curd & J.A. Cover\n \n These are the sources I have the grad students read for the course I teach in the philosophy of science. Losee gives the most detailed discussion of William of Ockham of the 3. \n \n If you go to the web, you find things like this:\n \"The simplest explanation is the best.\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_Razor\n \n \"Consider for example the following two theories aimed at describing the motion of the planets around the sun:\n The planets move around the sun in ellipses because there is a force between any of them and the sun which decreases as the square of the distance. \n The planets move around the sun in ellipses because there is a force between any of them and the sun which decreases as the square of the distance. This force is generated by the will of some powerful aliens.\" http://phyun5.ucr.edu/~wudka/Physics7/Notes_www/node10.html \n \n Now, look at this one and compare it to Ockham's own example of the Razor.\n \n Saying \"the planets move\" is no different than saying \"a body moves\". We have just gotten specific about which body we are talking about.\n \n So, using the Razor, what should be stated is \"The planets move around the sun in ellipses\" Saying \"there is a force between any of them and the sun which decreases as the square of the distance\" is unnecessary to describing the motion of planets. What the professor did was add a hypothesis for the cause of the motion. It is the same as saying \"because of an impetus\".\n \n In the last sentence, the author simply added a hypothesis for the source of the force. \n \n \nOverlooking the \"most likely\" bit now?\n\n \n Please pay attention. I'm setting William of Ockham in his historical context. His opponents were not overlooking \"most likely\". Instead, they were taking \"most likely\" to the extreme and saying \"this is what it actually is\". You do the same thing with your dead animal and car vs alien. While you say \"most likely\", what you really mean is that the alien hypothesis is wrong. \n \n \nActually, \"entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity\" was his statement. \"Most likely\" applies.\n\n \n That's PART of his statements. You are taking it out of context. Haven't we learned from creationists not to do that? Where is \"most likely\" in the statement you quoted? However, I do see \"should not\", which is equivalent to \"do not\".\n \n \nOut of curiosity, do you really consider those to be competing hypotheses with equal explanatory power?\n\n \n Where are there 2 hypotheses? We have a description of a phenomenon: a body moves and onehypothesis as an explanation: an impetus. Are you thinking \"a body moves\" is a hypothesis? No, it's not. It's an observation. That was Ockham's point. Saying \"light refracts in water\" is an observation. Saying \"that refraction will be 1/2 the angle of incidence because it is simpler\" is a hypothesis. \n \n \nExcept that we need to know all of the facts. If it were found that a dead animal had exterrestrial compounds on it, something involving space would become more likely.\n\n \n 1. Don't tell me, you're a Bayesian, aren't you?\n 2. Look at your original statement paragraph. You already dismissed the alien hypothesis before you even looked for extraterrestrial compounds on it. Having declared the alien hypothesis as \"unlikely\" (= wrong), why would anyone look for extraterrestrial compounds? After all, the alien hypothesis, according to you, has more \"assumptions\" and is therefore more likely to be correct compared to the hypothesis that a car hit the animal. \n \n This is where the mistaken version of Ockham's Razor is harmful to science: it stops research. All we have to do is compare the number of assumptions and decide that the theory with fewer assumptions is wrong. No data. No investigation. Simply sit and count assumptions.\n \n Right now there is a new theory on the origin of the universe called \"ekpyrotic\". This assumes a 5 D 'brane AND two 4 D universes. Two assumptions. The theory that \"God zapped the universe into being\" only has one assumption: God. Therefore, according to you, we should prefer God to ekpyrotic. Do we? Do you?\n \n \nExcept that Occam's razor is used for comparing hypotheses. In this example, I expect that the \"car hit the animal\" hypothesis is simpler than any other hypothesis.\n\n \n And what do you conclude from this comparison? That the car hypothesis is correct and any other hypothesis is wrong, right? So you stop investigating. But is that how we should do science? NO. It's laziness and an intellectual copout. \n \n What we have is a misuse of the Razor. The Razor is not supposed to be used for comparing hypotheses. Instead, it's supposed to keep hypotheses out of descriptions of phenomenon.\n \n \nSupersport's hypothesis can explain the DNA by making additional assumptions: something or someone (god?) continuously changes the DNA.\n\n \n It's not \"assumptions\", but rather an ad hoc hypothesis. In this case, designed to make the original hypothesis immune from falsification.\n \n You can do this for any theory. Evolution included, and it has been done. PE can be considered an ad hoc hypothesis to keep the gaps in the fossil record from falsifying evolution.\n \n The key is whether the ad hoc hypothesis can be tested independently of the theory. In the case of PE, it can (and be supported). In the case of SS's ad hoc hypothesis, it can't. SS is saying that God changes the DNA exactly enough to account for the differences between neandertal and human DNA sequences. However, that contradicts his earlier hypothesis that DNA sequences are the same; differences depend simply on which genes are activated and when. \n \n \nOf course, that is less likely than the theory of evolution's explanation.\n\n \n This is weak, which is one reason I dislike the Bayesian approach. It makes ID a valid, tho unlikely, theory. This means it should be taught as a competitor to evolution. If you use deductivism and falsification tho, you can show ID hypotheses to be out and out false/wrong. Therefore they cannot be taught as valid.\n \n \nEither way, the theory of evolution can explain the DNA change with fewer assumptions.\n\n \n So what?? Who cares what the number of assumptions are? What we care about is whether the idea is correct. And to determine whether it is correct, you have to have data, not counting assumptions.\n \n \nIn your opinion. How do you know your interpretation is better?\n Oh, right, it has to assume less to explain the facts.\n\n \n NO! There are facts present that cannot possibly be true IF SS's theory is correct! That's the point. \n \n OK, let's go back to basic deductive logic:\n True statements cannot have false consequences. In symbolic logic:\n If H then C\n not C\n Therefore: not H\n \n That is, we have hypothesis H. It has consequences C. If you find that C is either not there or that there are consequences contradictory to C, then H is false.\n \n Neandertals and humans are lumped in one \"kind\" by creationists. Elephants and mammoths are another \"kind\". Now, if SS's theory is true, neandertals will have the same DNA sequences as humans, because it is a matter what genes are turned on and when, not a change of genes. (This is even more pronounced because creationists insist neandertals ARE members of H. sapiens). Same for mammoths and elephants. So now we look at DNA sequences. Are they the same? NO! Neandertals and H. sapiens differ by over 3 standard deviations from variation within H. sapiens populations. So, the consequences are wrong, therefore SS's hypothesis is wrong.\n \n No assumptions involved. Only data.\n \n \nI'm talking about \"evolution\" as defined by creationists. That includes abiogenesis and the big bang. I have attempted to show that these theories require fewer assumptions and are therefore more likely to be right.\n\n \n And why are you letting them define what the theory is? Especially when it is wrong. Of course, I am arguing that having fewer assumptions has nothing to do with being right.\n \n \nI am willing to challenge you to name them. I do not believe you can.\n\n \n \"A list of assumptions made by the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection:\n 1) Organisms interact with those around them.\n 2) There is variation within a population of organisms (few organisms have the same traits).\"\n \n These are not assumptions. Pandion would tell you they are observations. And they are. Look at Chapters 2 and 3 in Origin: http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin/texts/origin_6th/origin6th_fm.html \n \n \"3) Some organisms are able to survive better.\"\n \n That's not an assumption. It's a conclusion. \n \"But if variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterized will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life;\" Origin, p 127 6th ed.\n \n \") Organisms that survive better reproduce more.\"\n \n That also is not part of it. Organisms that survive do not necessarily produce more offspring than organisms that don't. Darwin put it this way:\n \" from the strong principle of inheritance they will will tend to produce offspring similarly characterized. \" op cit.\n \n Data, facts, and assumptions... When I wrote that post, I attempted to head off accusations of bais from creationists. I personally would classify evolution and natural selection as facts, but they wouldn't.\n \n \"5) Organisms that reproduce more become a larger percent of the population.\"\n \n That's not an assumption. It's a deterministic result of Mendelian genetics. And, as stated, it is wrong. The organisms themselves don't become a larger percent of the population, but rather a larger percent of the population is descended from them\n \n \"8) The process detailed above brought organisms to the point they are at today. <MAJOR ASSUMPTION<\n 9) Earth is approximately the age that the evidence points to (~4.8 billion years old).\"\n \n Again, neither of these are \"assumptions\". Rather, 8 and 9 are conclusions \n \n \n\n However, I did state \"Occam's razor can also be applied to claims that a deity created the universe as is.\"\n\n \n No, it can't. The Ockham's Razor statement would be \"the universe exists\". Then you would be adding \"because ...\" to that. Instead, deductive logic can be applied to those claims and they can be shown to be false. Have been shown to be false.\n \n \nWith incomplete information, Occam's razor is useful to find the most likely conclusion. If more information is found, the same conclusion may not be the most likely. This is a \"real scientific world example\" of why the phrase \"most likely\" is important.\n\n \n It's a real world example of the incorrectness of the principle. I was in one of those 8 labs in the 1980s trying to purify BMP.\n Syftestad, G.T., Lucas, P.A., and Caplan, A.I. The in vitro chondrogenic response of limb-bud mesenchyme to a water-soluble fraction prepared from demineralized bone matrix. Differentiation 29: 230-237, 1985.\n Syftestad, G.T., Lucas, P.A., Ohgushi, H., and Caplan, A.I. Chondrogenesis as an in vitro response to bioactive factors extracted from adult bone and non-skeletal tissues. In: Development and Diseases of Cartilage and Bone Matrix, (Sen, A. and Thornhill, T., eds.) UCLA Symposium on Molecular and Cellular Biology 46 pg 187, (1986).\n \n The reason we weren't able to purify BMP was because we thought the mistaken version of the Razor was correct and we never looked for different BMP genes and proteins. We didn't multipy entities unnecessarily and thought there was only one BMP. It was only luck that different BMPs were found. Even Wozney and Wang didn't discard the Razor. Instead, they were at a dead end and assumed that the problem was purification techniques, not more BMPs.\n \n Today, people in growth factors, signal transduction and transcription control don't even bother with the \"most likely\". Data has shown that the Razor is wrong. In the growth factor field, started looking for multiple forms of the same growth factor. They had no data within that hypothesis to do so. They just discarded the Razor and began looking. And their efforts were immediately rewarded. There are 21 interleukins and over 18 fibroblast growth factors. \n \n \n body of knowledge can force hypotheses to make additional assumptions. People usually choose the simpler hypothesis because of the principles of Occam's razor.\n\n \n And, as I have shown, that is the wrong thing to do. The only criteria for choosing a hypothesis is the data.\n \n \n I know that. It was not my intention to show that a deity does not exist; I wanted to refute the fundamentalist interpretation (again).\n\n \n OK. But then let me urge you to choose your words more carefully. You started out as:\n \"Occam's razor can also be applied to claims that a deity created the universe as is.\"\n \n If you think \"as is\" is critical, then let's look at your list and see how many are irrelevant to \"as is\"\n \n 1) A deity (God) exists. \n 3) God created the universe and everything inside.\n 5) God wants everyone to believe in him.\n 9) Jesus was the son of God (and part of God).\n 10) The world will end as part of God's plan.\n \n Fully half your list is directed at theism in general and not Fundamentalism. You used an 8 gauge shotgun when you wanted a 30-06 rifle. What those 5 items on the list are going to do is alienate theists in general and make your attempt to refute the Fundie interpretation of the Bible more difficult. 1, 3, and 9 are common to all intepretations of the Bible.",

Does it need to be the same as \"Ockham?\"\n \nThis is about the accuracy of the idea. If I am going to invoke Darwin on natural selection, then I need to use the full description of natural selection and not just \"survival of the fittest\" and try to make NS a tautology. \n\n I would invoke the current theory of evolution, not Darwin. You know, just in case things have changed...\n \nIn this case, the \"advance\" has led to an incorrect idea. \n\n I would have to say that it is a practical, incorrect idea, if it is incorrect. Of course, that doesn't mean you should avoid collecting data; it simply helps draw a conclusion when you have collected as much (relevant) data as possible.\n \nIf you want to discuss the new idea that \"the simplest explanation is most likely correct\", then I did that in my example of BMP. That idea is wrong.\n\n Well, the simplest explanation often proves to be correct. I could give you examples, but I'm not sure you would pay attention.\n Just to show I'm not bluffing: if you typed a paper while sleepy, went to bed, and woke up only to find errors in your paper, the best conclusion would be to assume that you made the mistakes, rather than that a hacker put them there. I expect that most times, there was no hacker. The explanation with fewer assumptions is more likely to be correct.\n However, having all the information is important. If you later find out that a computer genius was submitting a paper to a contest that you were submitting yours to and that most of the other papers involved had many errors, the likelyhood of a hacker goes up.\n \n Yes, I know that was a weird example. I only used it because there is someone who actually believes (according to rinkworks.com) that a hacker messes with her writing.\n \nBut the point is that the Razor should not be used to test hypotheses! That isn't what Ockham stated the Razor as. \n\n Ok, I will now refer to the principle of parsimony. Will that satisfy you?\n \nThe whole point is that you can't use this warped version of the Razor for hypothesis testing. In the example, impetus was a hypothesis for a cause for movement. Ockham eliminated the hypothesis as a description of the phenonmenon.\n\n And if there are two competing hypotheses that are actually hard to choose between? As they get closer, it becomes less possible to choose by instinct or testing. A principle comes in handy.\n \nHi_Its_Me listed only 2 of the possible hypotheses. Then, without testing either hyopothesis, he eliminated one as \"unlikely\" and used \"unlikely\" to = false. But there was not testing. \n\n A minimal amount of data was gathered. That data was: a dead animal was found on a road.\n \nYet testing is not only possible but easy. Last year my daughter's car hit a deer. The deer's carcass wasn't found but it would have had pieces of glass embedded in it. Testing those pieces would show that they came from the windshield of a Pontiac Sunfire. That eliminates the alien spaceship hypothesis. (Unless you propose the ad hoc hypothesis that the spaceship coincidentally had glass identical to that of a Pontiace Sunfire. However, that ad hoc hypothesis can't be independently tested and is therefore invalid). \n\n Lucaspa listed 1 of the possible ad hoc hypotheses. Then, because he was unable to test it, he eliminated it as \"invalid\" and used \"invalid\" to = false.\n If you misinterpret my posts, I will misinterpret yours. I meant \"unlikely\" to mean \"probably not true.\" That does not mean that it is necessarily false. Without much data in that example, it is impossible to tell for sure what is \"true.\"\n \nThe point is that the data falsifies SS's theory. Since neandertals are humans -- in creationism -- then by SS's theory their DNA sequences should be the same as ours. SS's theory is that there is a difference in which genes are activated, not that the sequences differ. Well, the sequences differ. THerefore, by deductive logic, SS's theory must be false.\n\n Except that he can keep adding ad hoc hypotheses and make his hypothesis unfalsifiable.\n \nYou don't use comparative number of entities to evaluate theories: you use data.\n\n And if the data supports both theories equally well?\n \nThe modern misstatement of the Razor is incorrect. \n\n But it is useful...\n \nYes, they do. So why should you make the same mistake? We correct creationists about this mistake all the time on other boards. See talkorigins debate board. That Hi_Its_Me went along with the mistake showed that he was no longer discussing evolution or even science, but arguing atheism vs theism.\n\n Correct. That post was directed at people who believe in a literal interpretation of the bible. More specifically, marc and supersport.\n \nAnd that's an observation, isn't it? Not an assumption. Calling it an assumption was the mistake. Darwin devotes a whole chapter to this.\n\n So your only complaint was the use of the word \"assumption?\"\n \nIf you invoke Ockham's Razor, then you must invoke the correct form of it, not the changed form. Especially when the changed form is wrong and contradicts the original form.\n\n And if you invoke theism, should you use the original form (fundamentalism)?\n \nIf you go to the web, you find things like this:\n \"The simplest explanation is the best.\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_Razor\n\n Wow. I thought only creationists used quote mines. Well, live and learn...\n The full quote is:\n \"In light of this, the popular rephrasing of the razor - \"The simplest explanation is the best one\" - can lead to a gross oversimplification when the word simple is taken at face value.\"\n That is the only place your quote appears on the page.\n \nPlease pay attention. I'm setting William of Ockham in his historical context. \n\n If you are determined to use only the original \"Ockham's Razor,\" then I will simply say that I am using the principle of parsimony and that it is valid. I will also assert that it is both useful and relevant.\n \nHis opponents were not overlooking \"most likely\". Instead, they were taking \"most likely\" to the extreme and saying \"this is what it actually is\". You do the same thing with your dead animal and car vs alien. While you say \"most likely\", what you really mean is that the alien hypothesis is wrong. \n\n And my interpretation of my writing is that I didn't mean that. Who has more authority?\n \nThat's PART of his statements. You are taking it out of context. Haven't we learned from creationists not to do that? Where is \"most likely\" in the statement you quoted? However, I do see \"should not\", which is equivalent to \"do not\".\n\n \"Should not\" is a suggestion. \"Do not\" is a command.\n Also, if you have what you believe to be his statements on file, could you give me the entire quote?\n \nWhere are there 2 hypotheses? We have a description of a phenomenon: a body moves and onehypothesis as an explanation: an impetus. Are you thinking \"a body moves\" is a hypothesis? \n\n No. Are you?\n I suppose you are unwilling to accept my interpretation of the razor. By the way, yours isn't necessarily the only or the best one.\n \n1. Don't tell me, you're a Bayesian, aren't you?\n\n It depends. I don't agree that degrees of certainty can be used a evidence, but I do agree that a hypothesis/theory should be revised to accept new and old evidence. There are different definitions. Which do you use?\n \n2. Look at your original statement paragraph. You already dismissed the alien hypothesis before you even looked for extraterrestrial compounds on it. Having declared the alien hypothesis as \"unlikely\" (= wrong), why would anyone look for extraterrestrial compounds? After all, the alien hypothesis, according to you, has more \"assumptions\" and is therefore more [?] likely to be correct compared to the hypothesis that a car hit the animal. \n\n Less likely, actually.\n What I did was provide a limited amount of data and ask what the best conclusion would be. It was an exercise, and I imagine you would come to that conclusion, too.\n However, if you believe that the animals I find on my road were struck by a spaceship, you may need to explain your reasoning.\n \nThis is where the mistaken version of Ockham's Razor is harmful to science: it stops research. All we have to do is compare the number of assumptions and decide that the theory with fewer assumptions is wrong. No data. No investigation. Simply sit and count assumptions.\n\n Actually, with more data that changes the number of assumptions required, it is possible to reach a greater degree of certainty about something. The greater degree of certainty you reach, the better you will be able to apply your findings.\n \nRight now there is a new theory on the origin of the universe called \"ekpyrotic\". This assumes a 5 D 'brane AND two 4 D universes. Two assumptions. The theory that \"God zapped the universe into being\" only has one assumption: God. Therefore, according to you, we should prefer God to ekpyrotic. Do we? Do you?\n\n All assumptions (to add another qualifier) should be equal. The assumptions necessary for god would be more involved, considering the immense amount of energy and precision necessary to \"zap\" the universe into existance.\n As for the new theory, I won't accept it until I find that it explains the known data with fewer assumptions than the big bang theory.\n \nAnd what do you conclude from this comparison? That the car hypothesis is correct and any other hypothesis is wrong, right? \n\n Wrong.\n Please read what I said above.\n \nWhat we have is a misuse of the Razor. The Razor is not supposed to be used for comparing hypotheses. Instead, it's supposed to keep hypotheses out of descriptions of phenomenon.\n\n Just like evolution wasn't supposed to be used to show that fundamentalism is wrong? Despite my claims that logic is a better tool for refuting fundamentalism, evolution is perceived as the big \"threat.\"\n \nThe key is whether the ad hoc hypothesis can be tested independently of the theory. In the case of PE, it can (and be supported). In the case of SS's ad hoc hypothesis, it can't. SS is saying that God changes the DNA exactly enough to account for the differences between neandertal and human DNA sequences. However, that contradicts his earlier hypothesis that DNA sequences are the same; differences depend simply on which genes are activated and when. \n\n He could say that god changes only fossilized DNA to make it look like \n \nThis is weak, which is one reason I dislike the Bayesian approach. It makes ID a valid, tho unlikely, theory. This means it should be taught as a competitor to evolution. If you use deductivism and falsification tho, you can show ID hypotheses to be out and out false/wrong. Therefore they cannot be taught as valid.\n\n You say it is weak because it supports ID's position? That doesn't make it weak; it just doesn't make sense.\n However, when I say that it is less likely, I am not saying that it is a scientific theory. In the position it is in, it is unfalsifiable, because it has to use untestable ad hoc hypotheses to stay possible.\n \nSo what?? Who cares what the number of assumptions are? What we care about is whether the idea is correct. And to determine whether it is correct, you have to have data, not counting assumptions.\n\n I would agree, except that there are situations where the data supports two ideas. If it appears to support both ideas equally, what do you do?\n \nNO! There are facts present that cannot possibly be true IF SS's theory is correct! That's the point. \n\n I'm not saying that any of supersport's hypotheses are correct. I'm just trying to present facts in a way that he may accept them.\n \nNeandertals and humans are lumped in one \"kind\" by creationists. Elephants and mammoths are another \"kind\". Now, if SS's theory is true, neandertals will have the same DNA sequences as humans, because it is a matter what genes are turned on and when, not a change of genes. (This is even more pronounced because creationists insist neandertals ARE members of H. sapiens). Same for mammoths and elephants. So now we look at DNA sequences. Are they the same? NO! Neandertals and H. sapiens differ by over 3 standard deviations from variation within H. sapiens populations. So, the consequences are wrong, therefore SS's hypothesis is wrong.\n \n No assumptions involved. Only data.\n\n And when supersport says that the fossil record was created by god to test the faith of the people? He could make his hypothesis unfalsifiable, and he wouldn't care that it would be unscientific.\n \nAnd why are you letting them define what the theory is? Especially when it is wrong. Of course, I am arguing that having fewer assumptions has nothing to do with being right.\n\n But do you think that more assumptions is more likely to be correct?\n \nNo, it can't. The Ockham's Razor statement would be \"the universe exists\". Then you would be adding \"because ...\" to that. Instead, deductive logic can be applied to those claims and they can be shown to be false. Have been shown to be false.\n\n I wrote this thread to compare the theory of evolution with fundamentalist assertions. These cannot be shown to be gaurenteed false because any and all scientific evidence could have been planted by god.\n \nIt's a real world example of the incorrectness of the principle. I was in one of those 8 labs in the 1980s trying to purify BMP.\n Syftestad, G.T., Lucas, P.A., and Caplan, A.I. The in vitro chondrogenic response of limb-bud mesenchyme to a water-soluble fraction prepared from demineralized bone matrix. Differentiation 29: 230-237, 1985.\n Syftestad, G.T., Lucas, P.A., Ohgushi, H., and Caplan, A.I. Chondrogenesis as an in vitro response to bioactive factors extracted from adult bone and non-skeletal tissues. In: Development and Diseases of Cartilage and Bone Matrix, (Sen, A. and Thornhill, T., eds.) UCLA Symposium on Molecular and Cellular Biology 46 pg 187, (1986).\n\n Please try to seperate your sources from your quotes. It makes it unnecessarily complicated (use your interpretation of Occam's razor).\n \nThe reason we weren't able to purify BMP was because we thought the mistaken version of the Razor was correct and we never looked for different BMP genes and proteins. We didn't multipy entities unnecessarily and thought there was only one BMP. It was only luck that different BMPs were found. Even Wozney and Wang didn't discard the Razor. Instead, they were at a dead end and assumed that the problem was purification techniques, not more BMPs.\n\n Assuming that the simplest solution is correct is wrong (the assumption is wrong). As you have shown, it is not always correct. Also, Occam's razor is most useful with more data.\n Presented with the two hypotheses that either purification techniques were done poorly or that there was more than one BMP, the scientists decided that their previous assumption held even when called into question. Ideally, they would have gathered more data.\n \nToday, people in growth factors, signal transduction and transcription control don't even bother with the \"most likely\". Data has shown that the Razor is wrong. \n\n Data has shown that the hypothesis with fewest assumptions is not always correct. Does this mean that hypotheses with more assumptions are more likely (or even equally likely)?\n \nIn the growth factor field, started looking for multiple forms of the same growth factor. They had no data within that hypothesis to do so. They just discarded the Razor and began looking. And their efforts were immediately rewarded. There are 21 interleukins and over 18 fibroblast growth factors. \n\n So should people also look for more neucleotides and more planets within Mercury's orbit? The list of things that people could look for goes on and on.\n You have provided two examples of the hypothesis that assumed the fewest number of things being wrong. I can provide many more of it being right. Shall I?\n \nAnd, as I have shown, that is the wrong thing to do. The only criteria for choosing a hypothesis is the data.\n\n Do you have another method for choosing between hypotheses that explain the data equally well?\n For that paradox, induction is a valid response (I would use it myself), but the point is that there can be infinite hypotheses that support the data equally well.\n \nOK. But then let me urge you to choose your words more carefully. You started out as:\n \"Occam's razor can also be applied to claims that a deity created the universe as is.\"\n \n If you think \"as is\" is critical, then let's look at your list and see how many are irrelevant to \"as is\"\n \n 1) A deity (God) exists. \n 3) God created the universe and everything inside.\n 5) God wants everyone to believe in him.\n 9) Jesus was the son of God (and part of God).\n 10) The world will end as part of God's plan.\n \n Fully half your list is directed at theism in general and not Fundamentalism. You used an 8 gauge shotgun when you wanted a 30-06 rifle. What those 5 items on the list are going to do is alienate theists in general and make your attempt to refute the Fundie interpretation of the Bible more difficult. 1, 3, and 9 are common to all intepretations of the Bible.\n\n First, would you be more or less annoyed if I said, \"I do not believe that any deity or deities exist\"?\n \n Next, I will attempt to consider the theistic evolution view more next time.\n \n As for those points, I obviously interpreted them differently than you did:\n Number 1 is an assumption made by all forms of theism. It does not mean that God cannot exist; it means that theism requires one more assumption (which may balance out questions about the big bang).\n I meant number 3 to mean \"God created the universe and everything inside in the way described in the bible.\" That means no evolution, no big bang, and a large amount of work.\n Number 5 was intended to go with number 6 to point out that it is unrealistic to assume that God wants us to take the bible literally if he also tries to make people doubt the bible.\n Numbers 9 and 10 are (as far as I know) untestable. I therefore classify them as assumptions made by theism. I would like to know, though: which parts of the bible do you accept and which parts don't you accept?\n \n\" Meanwhile, are we hedging our bets here to the point of the ridiculous, clutching at straws and making things more complicated than necessary to keep open the possibility of God, meaning, the supernatural, and the human soul? If we have explained something satisfactorily, perhaps we could look for another explanation; but why should we?\n \" If there is any hope at all of perceiving the world without being entangled by a point of view, the realization of that hope must surely begin with a lesson we could have learned from everyday experience or almost any good fictional detective story: A simple explanation that ties in all the evidence isn't necessarily the right explanation. \n\n True, but it is likely.\n \nThe black creature in the tree is not always a crow. \n\n It could be a cat, or something else. However, if you assume crow, you are more likely to be correct.\n \nThe loud bang heard one summer day in my neighbourhood was not a backfire or a firecracker, or even someone murdering his wife. It was my neighbour shooting golf balls at a tree from a home-made brass mini-cannon. \n\n Or could it be a jet breaking the sound barrier? Or someone being whipped?\n The possibilities go on and on... If you don't know about a cannon, why do you think that it is one?\n If you heard that sound in a different country, would you be expecting a golf-ball cannon? Hopefully not...\n \nReal life, especially but not exclusively where human behaviour is involved, is not always best represented by the simplest explanation.\n\n Of course. Still, even if it isn't always best represented by that explanation, it usually is.\n \n\" We believe that there are uncomplicated, elegant laws underlying the untidiness. But even in science there always seem to be more loose ends than most of us prefer to think, and there is what fictional detective Sir Henry Merrivale (45) called 'the blasted cussedness of things in general' - the propensity of things to lend themselves to a simple, meaningful explanation, when in fact they have come about in damnably complicated and illogical ways. Attempts to generalize, to explain in a manner that satisfies our desire for neatness, simplicity, the most logical chain of cause and effect, may not always lead to truth. We can't be sure that ultimate truth will be simple. And of course there's another possibility, that our simplest scientific explanation isn't simple enough - that Bernstein was right about God being the simplest of all.\"\n Kitty Ferguson, The Fire in the Equations, pp 85-86\n\n Ok; so we don't know that simplicity is best, but when you have infinite complicated possibilities, how do you know which one to pick?",

   "And if I were to invoke the principle that is often called \"Occam's Razor\" nowadays? Does it need to be the same as \"Ockham?\"\n\n \n It should be. Otherwise, change the name! I'm reminded of the ID movement starting the Polyarni Institute at Baylor. Many people objected because Dembski and other IDers were saying that Polyarni would suipport what they were doing in studying science and religion. In fact, what Dembski and IDers were doing was antithetical to what Polyarni advocated. Therefore it was not appropriate to use Polyarni's name ... and the name was changed. The most recent NCSE Reports has the story.\n \n What you are calling \"Occam's Razor\" is exactly opposite of what Ockham actually stated. That's one problem. \n \n The second problem, of course, is that what you are using as \"Occam's Razor\" is simply wrong. Science doesn't work that way and we don't use the Razor to evaluate theories.\n \n Now, I see later in the post you want to call \"Occam's Razor\" parsimony. That's fine with me and I'll do so in the rest of this post. \n \n {quote] lucaspa: I am going to invoke Darwin on natural selection, \n \n I would invoke the current theory of evolution, not Darwin. You know, just in case things have changed...[/quote]\n \n Look at what I said: If I am going to invoke Darwin. I didn't say anything about \"the current theory of evolution\". You tried the old switcheroo here. You tried to make my apples into oranges.\n \n \nI would have to say that it is a practical, incorrect idea, if it is incorrect. Of course, that doesn't mean you should avoid collecting data; it simply helps draw a conclusion when you have collected as much (relevant) data as possible.\n\n \n Now I'll ask you: why draw a conclusion with insufficient data? And, is that conclusion knowledge or is it belief? IOW, when you see the dead animal by the road, is it knowledge that it was hit by a car or is it belief? Is it belief or knowledge that the animal was not hit by an alien spaceship?\n \n This is where the confusion arises. Sometimes you want parsimony to choose between hypotheses. This is science and we don't evaluate hypotheses by parsimony. But other times you use \"belief\" Like here:\n \n \nIt was an exercise, and I imagine you would come to that conclusion, too.\n However, if you believe that the animals I find on my road were struck by a spaceship, you may need to explain your reasoning.\n\n \n You start out by saying \"conclusion\" and then say \"if you believe\" Conclusion relates to knowlegdge and certainty. Belief has a lot less certainty to it. But you are going back and forth between \"conclusion\" and \"belief\" as tho they are equivalent. And then, of course, trying to invoke parsimony as how science decides.\n \n So, let's break this down:\n 1 Parsimony is used in science to evaluate theories. Absolutely not. \n 2. Parsimony is useful in reaching scientific conclusions. Absolutely not.\n 3. Parsimony is useful and accurate in reaching personal conclusions. Dicey. I would say \"not\", because of the implications for certainty inherent in the word \"conclusion\".\n 4. Parsimony is useful in reaching reasonable beliefs. Yes. It can provide a reason for your belief. As long as you are careful to recognize that it is a belief. \n \n \nWell, the simplest explanation often proves to be correct. I could give you examples, but I'm not sure you would pay attention.\n\n \n Now you are using the word \"correct\". So you are using parsimony to pick out the correct explanation. That's certainty, isn't it?\n \n But not always. However, \"often\" doesn't help you in particular cases, does it? IOW, you can't extrapolate \"the simplest answer was correct in all those cases\" to \"the simplest answer is right in this case\". \n \n (BTW, in case you don't know it, that extrapolation is called \"induction\" and Hume showed that it is circular reasoning and invalid as a way to certain knowledge)\n \n \nJust to show I'm not bluffing: if you typed a paper while sleepy, went to bed, and woke up only to find errors in your paper, the best conclusion would be to assume that you made the mistakes, rather than that a hacker put them there. I expect that most times, there was no hacker. The explanation with fewer assumptions is more likely to be correct.\n\n \n Again, you are applying induction. However, have you thought how you can test each of these hypotheses so that you can falsify one or the other? I bet not. You see, you are being lazy. You are thinking that the hypotheses can't be tested or are unwilling to test it. \n \n \nYes, I know that was a weird example. I only used it because there is someone who actually believes (according to rinkworks.com) that a hacker messes with her writing.\n\n \n Easy enough to test. Make sure she writes when not connected to the internet. Then save a copy of the work on a flashdrive and remove the flashdrive. Then write the same thing while connected to the internet. Compare what is on the flashdrive (on another computer) to what is on her computer after it is connected to the internet.\n \n \nAnd if there are two competing hypotheses that are actually hard to choose between? As they get closer, it becomes less possible to choose by instinct or testing. A principle comes in handy.\n\n \n Now you are doing #1 in my list above! You are trying to use parsimony to choose between hypotheses. But what does \"choose\" mean in science? It means deciding, or concluding, which is correct and which is incorrect! So, when you \"choose\", you are saying that the hypothesis you didn't choose is incorrect. Now, you may not mean that, but it is what you are doing nonetheless.\n \n So, in science, what do we do in this case? You don't choose. Why do you feel you must choose? You don't. You simply withhold judgement until the necessary data is available. \n \n What Ockham was saying is that you don't put in a hypothesis as part of describing the phenomenon.\n \n \n If you misinterpret my posts, I will misinterpret yours. I meant \"unlikely\" to mean \"probably not true.\" That does not mean that it is necessarily false. Without much data in that example, it is impossible to tell for sure what is \"true.\"\n\n \n Really? Let's go to the OP. You said \"What this post explains is that Occam's razor denies the accuracy of the bible because it makes too many assumptions to be more likely than the scientific explanation. Therefore, it is poor logic to accept the bible without further evidence.\"\n \n Now, if we are not \"to accept the bible\", what are we supposed to do? \n \n \"See my first example for a reason that we should keep our beliefs uncomplicated whenever possible. If we didn't, we would be swamped with thousands of explanations for very simple events, and most of the explanations would be illogical.\"\n \n What do you mean by \"illogical\". In context it seems that you are saying \"wrong\". Are you? If not, specify in detail how do you think an \"illogical\" belief would be correct?\n \n \"Except that Occam's razor is used for comparing hypotheses. \"\n \n Back to a scientific use of parsimony. What are we comparing them for? \"Most likely\" or for which hypothesis is true and which is false? I submit that you are being disingenuous. You actually mean that you can use parsimony to decide which hypothesis is true, but, when pressed that this doesn't work, fall back to \"most likely\".\n \n So let me ask, how \"most likely\"? What are the odds? How do you compute them? Is \"most likely\" 51% ot 49% or 100% to 0% or somewhere in between? Or does it change for each situation? If \"most likely\" changes, then how do we know what you actually mean?\n \n \n Except that he can keep adding ad hoc hypotheses and make his hypothesis unfalsifiable. \n\n \n Unfalsifiable to naive falsification. But 2 things are going to happen:\n 1. The ad hoc hypotheses are going to contradict each other and the main hypothesis. That is, the consequences of one of the ad hoc hypotheses will contradict the consequences of another hypothesis.\n 2. The ad hoc hypothesis will not be independently testable. It's only consequence will be to save the theory from falsification. At that point the ad hoc hypothesis is invalid. (For an example of this in science, see the Lorentz Contraction as an ad hoc hypothesis to avoid falsification of the aether by the Michelson-Morely experiments.)\n \n \nAnd if the data supports both theories equally well?\n\n \n Same answer as I gave above. Then both theories stay on the table and you don't choose between them until the necessary data is available. This is what you do in science.\n \n Now, in your personal life, you can \"choose\" and decide to believe that one theory is correct and the other wrong. But that is a belief and not science. So, I believe a car hit the animal. But that is my personal belief until and unless I gather data to test that hypothesis.\n \n \nBut it is useful...\n\n \n Not in science! It's harmful in science. Where parsimony is useful is as a reason for a belief. But since beliefs are uncertain by their very nature, the usefulness of parsimony is limited. The only place I see that it is \"useful\" is as a (mistaken) \"proof\" for atheism.\n \n \n So your only complaint was the use of the word \"assumption?\"\n\n \n For that particular mistake. You had other mistakes that went beyond being unable to correctly label \"assumptions\". You didn't respond to them.\n \n \nAnd if you invoke theism, should you use the original form (fundamentalism)?\n\n \n The original form was NOT fundamentalism. Fundamentalism dates only to 1905-1910 with the publication of the series of pamphlets entitled The Fundamentals. http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Parthenon/6528/fundcont.htm It is not until then that we see the idea that the Bible is literal and inerrant. Up until then Judeo- Christianity was not insistent on a literal, inerrant Bible. If you look at the founding statements of Christianity -- the Nicean and Apostle's Creeds -- you will find no mention of creationism or Fundamentalism.\n \n \nWow. I thought only creationists used quote mines. Well, live and learn...\n The full quote is:\n \"In light of this, the popular rephrasing of the razor - \"The simplest explanation is the best one\" - can lead to a gross oversimplification when the word simple is taken at face value.\"\n\n \n My apologies. Wikipedia has been edited since I got that quote a year ago. \n \"In science, the simplest theory that fits the facts of a problem is the one that should be selected.\" http://www.2think.org/occams_razor.shtml\n \n \nlucaspa: While you say \"most likely\", what you really mean is that the alien hypothesis is wrong. \n \n And my interpretation of my writing is that I didn't mean that. Who has more authority?\n\n \n Hmm. Denial without explanation or new argument. Not very convincing. What DID you mean? You keep talking about \"deciding\" between hypotheses and parsimony is useful to do that. What are you deciding if not which one is correct and which incorrect? Where does \"most likely\" get you in search of truth?\n \n \n \"Should not\" is a suggestion. \"Do not\" is a command.\n\n \n LOL! if you \"should not\" do something, that is the same as telling you not to actually do it! Nice semantic game you are playing.\n \n [quote]lucaspa: Where are there 2 hypotheses? We have a description of a phenomenon: a body moves and one hypothesis as an explanation: an impetus. Are you thinking \"a body moves\" is a hypothesis? \n \n \nNo. Are you?\n\n \n If \"a body moves\" is not a hypothesis, then where is the second hypothesis? I'm saying there is only one hypothesis: because of an impetus\". YOU said there were 2 hypotheses. Where is the other one?\n \n \nI suppose you are unwilling to accept my interpretation of the razor. By the way, yours isn't necessarily the only or the best one.\n\n \n I am stating what Ockham proposed. You are stating something different.\n \n \n It depends. I don't agree that degrees of certainty can be used a evidence, but I do agree that a hypothesis/theory should be revised to accept new and old evidence. There are different definitions. Which do you use?\n\n \n Science mandates that a hypothesis/theory must be revised (or rejected) in the face of data. That isn't a Bayesnian approach. Bayesian statistics attempts to quantify the probability that a hypothesis is correct based on the accumulating evidence. New data changes the probability. In a Bayesian approach, the hypothesis/theory doesn't get revised. What changes is the probability it is correct.\n \n \n Less likely, actually.\n What I did was provide a limited amount of data and ask what the best conclusion would be.\n\n \n Let me ask the question again: once you came to \"the best conclusion\", why would you go looking for more data? Again, isn't \"best conclusion\" = right? And that means that the other conclusion is wrong?\n \n \nActually, with more data that changes the number of assumptions required, it is possible to reach a greater degree of certainty about something. The greater degree of certainty you reach, the better you will be able to apply your findings.\n\n \n Oh boy, trying to tie Bayesian statistics to the number of assumptions! Nowhere in Bayesian analysis is there a term for number of assumptions.\n \n Once again you are trying to tie number of assumptions to the correctness of a hypothesis. There is no such connection. It doesn't exist. In science, you only use data to evaluate hypotheses. In Bayesian analysis, each study represents more DATA, not a change in assumptions.\n \n \nAll assumptions (to add another qualifier) should be equal. The assumptions necessary for god would be more involved, considering the immense amount of energy and precision necessary to \"zap\" the universe into existance.\n\n \n You really should not have put in another qualifier. The idea is wrong anyway. This doesn't help it. How do you calculate equivalence? Notice that you tied \"god\" to a particular method of creation. You have \"assumptions for god\" but what you really mean is \"assumptions for the universe to be zapped into existence\". However, doesn't BB have the universe \"zapped\" into existence? There was nothing, then there was space, time, and energy. Since matter/energy can't be created nor destroyed , only change form, the immense amount of energy in the BB is the same as the energy now. \n \n \nAs for the new theory, I won't accept it until I find that it explains the known data with fewer assumptions than the big bang theory.\n\n \n Now we are into a new topic: whether you accept science. This states clearly that you aren't doing science. Ekpyrotic is supposed to give different gravity waves than BB and inflation. (BTW, did you add \"inflation\" and \"hot\" in as \"assumptions\" for BB?) So, if the gravity waves match ekpyrotic and contradict BB, you still won't accept ekpyrotic?\n \n BTW, do you accept Punctuated Equilibrium instead of phyletic gradualism?\n \n \n Originally Posted by lucaspa \n And what do you conclude from this comparison? That the car hypothesis is correct and any other hypothesis is wrong, right? \n \n Wrong.\n Please read what I said above.\n\n \n What you stated above was that I misinterpreted you. You never said what you really meant. You haven't here, either. It's a clever duck, but a duck.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by lucaspa \n What we have is a misuse of the Razor. The Razor is not supposed to be used for comparing hypotheses. Instead, it's supposed to keep hypotheses out of descriptions of phenomenon.\n \n Just like evolution wasn't supposed to be used to show that fundamentalism is wrong? Despite my claims that logic is a better tool for refuting fundamentalism, evolution is perceived as the big \"threat.\"\n\n \n emoticon_confused Talk about changing the topic!! Your response is a complete non-sequitor. I'm talking the use of the Razor, and you try to be irrelevant with evolution and fundamentalism?\n \n Notice you used the past tense. When Darwin wrote Origin of Species, Fundamentalism hadn't been invented yet. You have it backwards: Fundamentalism was conceived as a way of refuting evolution. Read some of the Fundamentals. Now, when you used the present tense \"evoution is perceived as the big threat\" you are correct. It is perceived NOW as a threat. \n \n \nHe could say that god changes only fossilized DNA to make it look like\n\n \n He can say it, but it's not valid. Either scientifically or theologically. Scientifically the ad hoc hypothesis is not independently testable. I bolded it the first time because that is the key. Christianity denies that God changes the fossilized DNA. If God did so, God would be lying. Christian doctrine is that God does not lie.\n \n \n you say it is weak because it supports ID's position? \n\n \n No, I'm saying that it is weak because it can never say anything for certain. If you say \"more likely\", it still means ID is POSSIBLE. Well, if it's POSSIBLE, then it should be taught as a valid, competing theory to evolution!\n \n \n However, when I say that it is less likely, I am not saying that it is a scientific theory. In the position it is in, it is unfalsifiable, because it has to use untestable ad hoc hypotheses to stay possible.\n\n \n Do you see the contradiction here? You say ID uses untestable ad hoc hypotheses to \"stay possible\". Why does ID have to do that? Because otherwise it is falsified. So, even tho you say it is \"unfalsified\", you also admit it already has been falsified. \n \n If you are going to say something is not a scientific theory, then you must have a definition of science that will include all of science but exclude ID and other ideas you don't consider to be scientific theories. Good luck with that. Scientists and philosophers of science have been trying that for 2500 years without success. (BTW, falsifiability can't serve as a way to decide whether a theory is scientific.) However, if you wish to discuss the problems with Demarcation, we should start a new thread. That's a whole huge can of worms. \n \n \nPlease try to seperate your sources from your quotes. It makes it unnecessarily complicated (use your interpretation of Occam's razor).\n\n \n It's not a quote. If you look at the author's list of those papers, you see \"Lucas, P.A\". Apparently you didn't twig that that is me.\n \n \nAssuming that the simplest solution is correct is wrong (the assumption is wrong). As you have shown, it is not always correct. Also, Occam's razor is most useful with more data.\n\n \n It's so much fun to see you backtrack. In previous posts you said parsimony was more useful with LESS data. After all, the data with the dead animal was very limited, wasn't it? Up above you said that, with data, parsimony is unnecessary. So, it's only in the absence of data that parsimony is useful. But now when parsimony leads you astray, you call for more data.\n \n Also above you say you evaluate theories on the number of assumptions. Well, the number of assumptions hasn't changed. But what are you calling for? More DATA! emoticon_wow \n \n \nPresented with the two hypotheses that either purification techniques were done poorly or that there was more than one BMP, the scientists decided that their previous assumption held even when called into question. Ideally, they would have gathered more data.\n\n \n Up above you said we should count assumptions! Which was more parsimonius? That there were multiple BMPs or that proven purification techniques just had to be applied correctly? The second, of course. No increase in entities: purification stayed the same. \n \n You just don't get it. The decision on how to gather more data hinged on parsimony. With the parsimonious conclusion that there was only one BMP, then the way to find that BMP -- gather more data -- was to continue with purification procedures. But those couldn't purify a single protein, because there were more than two.\n \n \nData has shown that the hypothesis with fewest assumptions is not always correct. Does this mean that hypotheses with more assumptions are more likely (or even equally likely)?\n\n \n You tell me. What does \"more likely\" or \"equally likely\" have to do with being actually correct? As you noted, you use DATA to show whether a hypothesis is REALLY correct. So why would you even mess around with \"more likely\"? Instead, go the direct route and use data to find out if the hypothesis really is correct!\n \n \nSo should people also look for more neucleotides and more planets within Mercury's orbit? The list of things that people could look for goes on and on.\n You have provided two examples of the hypothesis that assumed the fewest number of things being wrong. I can provide many more of it being right. Shall I?\n\n \n I only provided 2 to illustrate. I can also provide more. Also remember that I am falsifying your hypothesis: that parsimony is a method to determine correct hypotheses. All I need is a few to show the hypothesis wrong. It doesn't matter how many examples \"for\" you have. Just as it doesn't matter how many IC systems are not explained by Darwinian evolution. As soon as ONE was explained, IC as support for ID died.\n \n \nFor that paradox, induction is a valid response (I would use it myself), but the point is that there can be infinite hypotheses that support the data equally well.\n\n \n Yes, there can. And that is one reason why science NEVER \"proves\", only DISproves. What science does is falsify all the competing hypotheses we can think of. One reason science is tentative is because there may be a hypothesis out there that we haven't thought of that explains the data better. You have heard that science is tentative, right?\n \n \nFirst, would you be more or less annoyed if I said, \"I do not believe that any deity or deities exist\"?\n\n \n MUCH less. To the point that I would not only not be annoyed, but would be pleased. That's an honest statement of faith. I'm not here to change your belief. You're welcome to it.",

   "I am going to restate my views on Occam's Razor and the principle of parsimony. I hope this will answer most of your questions and clarify my position.\n \n \n \n 1) It is impossible to prove anything without all the data (in the universe). This is because previously unknown data may falsify a theory, hypothesis, or even a fact. For example: consider Euclid's postulate that it is possible to draw a straight line between any two points. Two points could be found that cannot be connected by a straight line.\n \n 2) Things are classified as fact if they can be observed by any competent observer. This does not mean that they are correct (or proven). It simply provides a starting point for science (similar to Euclid's postulates).\n \n 3) Based on facts, it is possible to come up with logical hypotheses (hypotheses which match all known data). These hypotheses are sometimes falsified by subsequent observation, and so are not infalliable.\n \n 4) It is possible to predict, with varying degrees of certainty, which hypotheses out of a group are least likely to be falsified. To clarify: the group of hypotheses should be based on similar observations and should be distinct (they should make different predictions). This method is Occam's Razor (or the principle of parsimony). I will not define my interpretation; that has been done.\n \n 5) When used, Occam's Razor provides the hypothesis that is least likely to be falsified. If a narrow margin exists between hypotheses, Occam's Razor is more likely to predict inaccurately than if a large margin exists. By \"more likely,\" I mean that it will be accurate in more of the cases (the other hypotheses will be falsified). Occam's Razor cannot be judged to be \"true\" in any one case because the hypothesis it supports cannot be judged to be correct. The hypothesis may be falsified and Occam's Razor would have made the wrong prediction. I am asserting, however, that Occam's Razor is usually not wrong (if you consider the multitude of times it is used).\n \n 6) Without Occam's Razor, there is no rational basis for accepting one hypothesis over any other. This is because for every hypothesis, there exist an infinitely large number of counter-hypotheses (see grue). Without a method of choosing between hypotheses, it would be impossible to decide anything. I do not know of another way to choose. So, when you say that data supports something, consider that the data also support an arbitrarily large number of other things. How do you conclude that it supports one thing rather than another?\n \n \n By the way, I am willing to answer specific points you made earlier, but I will not answer them all. Please point out any you want answered.",
