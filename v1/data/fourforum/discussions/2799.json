Isn't that just another way to circumvent the separation of church and state?\n \n What about all these religious leaders praising one party over another and pushing for their followers to vote for this candidate or that candidate? I don't think it should be allowed.\n \n What about the oath the newly elected president takes to \"uphold and defend the constitution of the United States\"? Ignoring, attempting to ammend it, or working around it seems to be common these days.\n \n People get mad when prayer was taken out of schools. What if you were a Christian and the Government said you must say \"in the name of Alla's name we pray\" would you still want prayer in school?\n \n I think that not paying attention to the consititution, as it was written, really sucks!",

What freedom from religion does mean, however, is the freedom from the rules and dogmas of other people's religious beliefs so that we can be free to follow the demands of our own conscience, whether they take a religious form or not.\n If it were to be really separate, wouldn't our money not have \"In GOD we trust\" etc etc...\n Plus a lot of people do not realize that the majority of people voting are religious and that will show in who gets elected...\n May not seem fair but it certainly is there...",

You mean that the last around 50 years of government interperetation of the constition is a \"common misconception.\" ?\n \n Terral's reply << While GreatMoose used this phrase, please allow me to offer a reply. While congress has not supported the establishment of any religion, our forefathers saw fit to have a moment of silent prayer, after our Pledge of Allegiance. I remember this moment of silent prayer growing up in the public school system. GreatMoose appears to be acknowledging the fact that a judicial order to remove prayer from the equation is a violation of someone's First Amendment rights. After all, congress has no right to create a law that prohibits the free exercise of religion. Are we clear on that aspect?\n \n So no judicial order restricting public prayer can possibly be based upon the accurate interpretation of our Constitutional Rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. If my take on this is correct, then he is also not offering any support or constitutional evidence for adding school prayer as being legal either. However, since the tradition was established before most of us were born, then removing the practice by court order is a violation of our civil rights. Therefore, this being true, his view is that there has been a lot of misinterpretation going on.\n \n Shocked << 2. You seem to stress that professing Christians are the majority, and are therefore allowed to impose their beliefs on everyone else? That's one of the most un-american things I've heard this year. \n \n Terral's reply << I wish your statement included evidence where this has taken place. I am just as willing to fight for your right to believe in nothing. Even with the moment of silent prayer in place, who forced any religion on any of your kids? If you are threatened by the children of professing Christians taking a moment for a public expression of their faith, then perhaps your belief system requires some updating, or something a bit more substantial, or something. I am sorry, but the public school environment is a microcosm of our society. Sooner or later they are likely to actually see another person praying, even if they never do at home. Take away prayer and give them all condoms: that's the ticket. \n \n Shocked << A democrocay (last I checked this is what America is) does indeed have majority rule, but we also have...minority rights. I hope everyone understands the two pillars this \"great nation\" was founded on. At least that's what I was taught, and have since come to admire and understand.\n \n Terral's reply << Actually, this is also a big misconception. Do you remember the Pledge? Was our allegiance to \"the democracy for which it stands?\" We live in a republic under laws, and not in a democracy under people. \n \n Shocked << 3. What exactly are \"Christians\" like yourself, not allowed to do? You can pray anywhere you like, you just can't force goverment sponsored institutions to promote your religion...ANY religion. \n \n Terral's reply << This is the straw man of many atheists seeking to prohibit the free expression of religion in this country. Government has no place in establishing or prohibiting the free exercise of religion . . . PERIOD. Prayer in public schools has been going on since before I was born.

   " Thank you very much for the approval, but the concerns of one holding your seemingly complacent views are not the focus of this topic. \n\n \n I figured they were since in your original post (the one I responded to) in your complaints about the left you mentioned prayer in school, and not the Ten Commandments in a courtroom. But no matter, I'll respond to that point in this post. \n \n Concerning the links you provided: It seems the judge was removed from office for refusing to obey a court order, and not for actually installing the Ten Commandments statue. That is a subtle difference, yes, but a fairly important one. \n \n His superior's (you could say the Moore's boss) decided his view on a matter was incorrect. Judge Moore is not the supreme judge of the land... the buck does not stop with him.\n \n But then again maybe you're arguing that the federal government should not meddle in the affairs of how a state government should run its state. In that case I would agree with you, I think the federal government should get out of the business of decided how states should run their state (making the Federal Marriage Amendment bogus... but that's neither here nor there). \n \n However (you knew it was coming) if a state government passes a law, or performs an action that undermines the federal constitution, then the action or law is not permissible. If a state constitution allowed for a ban on gun ownership, and a law was passed putting into effect a ban on gun ownership, the federal government would have the power to step in and overrule the ban. In this case the district judge found the monument to be unconstitutional, and so it was in his power to tell Moore what to do. \n \n If you want to continue the idea that there the government actually can pass laws that support religions, or subtly support one religion over another, then fine. We'll discuss that. But digest the above first. \n \n \nWhat about the rights of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, and the God fearing folks from the great state of Alabama? \n\n \n Since he was acting as a government official, in the setting of a government building, his actions represent government policy. He is free to erect a statue of the Ten Commandments on his front porch if he feels like it. In the same way any individual can be as much of a bigot as they please. However when acting as a government representative, they are not entitled to express those views. A private store owner can refuse service to a black patron simply because they are black... but to deny justice to someone because of their skin color is unconstitutional. And in the same way that Moore didn't actually pass any laws, discriminating against black people in a court room is not actually passing a law... but this still makes it a violation of the constitution. \n \n \nRemoving God's name and religious symbols from everything in America is not going to guarantee you anything.\n\n \n Hmm... I guess I'll have to explicitly state my beliefs in their entirety before I can expect you to make a fairly simple logical step. I would not support any kind of government action to modify any kind of symbol from the private sector. So I don't want to remove God's name and religious symbols from everything in America. I just want to remove them from government agencies that explicitly state they will not have such symbols.\n \n As you may or may not have noticed above (about Moore and the ten commandments) I didn't say one way or the other whether I thought what he did was right or wrong, or even if the ten commandments should be there. I just said that the federal government had jurisdiction, and they acted on it. \n \n As far as the term \"God\" in the pledge, I don't know about your state, but I feel that my state (California) is pretty clear on weather something of that nature should be allowed. \n \n \n Our forefathers before us placed them there as an exercise of their freedom of religion. \n\n \n in the same way that the founding fathers never mentioned God in the government's governing document, or on printed currency, or in the pledge? No, you must mean a different group of forefathers... perhaps maybe the forefathers from the cold war who wanted to stick it to the godless pinko commie atheists by putting \"God\" on our money and into the pledge. \n \n \nI am very sorry that all of you atheists in America were born into a country that has adhered to Judeo-Christian values from day one. \n\n \n as a side note, when examining the ten commandments not even half of them are actually expressed in US law. \n \n 1) No Gods before me: First amendment prohibits this kind of law.\n 2) No graven images: Not as explicitly forbidden as commandment 1, however this kind of law would probably never be passed as infringes on practice of religion.\n 3) No taking God's name in vain: First amendment also prohibits this kind of law. \n 4) No breaking of the Sabbath: again, no laws regarding what to do on any given day, and congress would be hard pressed to pass such a law.\n 5) No dishonoring parents: While is socially encouraged, there is no explicit law. Parents have legal jurisdiction over their children, but this says nothing about the children's obligations to their parents. \n 6) No Murder: Ta-da, this is in fact... illegal \n 7) No adultery: Not too sure about this one. I'm guessing there are not many laws prohibiting sleeping around... however I am fairly confident such laws are not enforced much. At any rate, to be on the safe side I'll say government law does express this. \n 8) No stealing: Yup, there are legal repercussions if we steal.\n 9) No Perjury: well, there is no law against lying in general...however it is a crime to lie and break contracts. Ok I'll give up this one to. So that's 4 so far.\n 10) No coveting: I'm pretty sure I don't know exactly what covet means in this context... but if it means desire, or to want... then there is no law against desiring or wanting something.\n \n So of the 4 (3.5) commandments that are actually expressed in our laws, did they really have to come from the Ten Commandments? Stealing, murdering, and lying are pretty much required for any productive society, and they have definitely been independently developed in religions and societies that didn't have access to the Ten Commandments. \n \n \n However, be mindful of the fact that we are living in a day where homosexuals have sprung aggressively from their closets seeking rights from our government, while at the same time faction groups (not all atheists) from among atheists want to remove God from everything.\n\n \n gasp, gay people are demanding equal rights? Well if they are entitled to those rights as humans, what is the problem? As for atheists, please find me an atheist who wants you to remove references to God in your private house... and then maybe I'll consider your assertion that any single person wants to remove God from everything. You do realize that government buildings and organizations are very different from the individuals that the constitution provided for... right?\n \n \n However, our elected officials (like Judge Roy Moore and everyone else) have the right to freely exercise their faith in any way they see fit, under the First Amendment. \n\n \n Including giving harsher sentences to homosexuals because their behavior is an abomination? Or awarding custody to the father (aka leader of the household) over the mother for no reason at all? As a representative of the government, their first and foremost responsibility is to uphold the ideals of the constitution and the government of the United States. In this case their religion does not come first, and their religion can not come first. When there is a conflict between the two ideals, the constitution will win. \n \n \nAgain, I am sorry that you were born into a country established by God fearing men with a Judeo-Christian value system. And yet thousands and thousands have died, and continue to give their lives, to preserve your right to believe in absolutely nothing. \n\n \n In your world it would be somehow tragic if the government represented a religious view that was different form yours... however when other are subjected to the same situation it's just an unfortunate circumstance. I am not fighting for an atheistic country, but rather a religiously neutral country. When given the choice between \"God\", \"No God\" and silence, I choose for the government to be silent. Please tell me you understand the distinction.",

   "Dear Shocked (Mach):\n \n Shocked wrote << 1. I'm confused by your definition of \"common misconception\". You mean that the last around 50 years of government interperetation of the constition is a \"common misconception.\" ?\n \n Terral's reply << While GreatMoose used this phrase, please allow me to offer a reply. While congress has not supported the establishment of any religion, our forefathers saw fit to have a moment of silent prayer, after our Pledge of Allegiance. I remember this moment of silent prayer growing up in the public school system. GreatMoose appears to be acknowledging the fact that a judicial order to remove prayer from the equation is a violation of someone's First Amendment rights. After all, congress has no right to create a law that prohibits the free exercise of religion. Are we clear on that aspect?\n \n So no judicial order restricting public prayer can possibly be based upon the accurate interpretation of our Constitutional Rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. If my take on this is correct, then he is also not offering any support or constitutional evidence for adding school prayer as being legal either. However, since the tradition was established before most of us were born, then removing the practice by court order is a violation of our civil rights. Therefore, this being true, his view is that there has been a lot of misinterpretation going on.\n \n Shocked << 2. You seem to stress that professing Christians are the majority, and are therefore allowed to impose their beliefs on everyone else? That's one of the most un-american things I've heard this year. \n \n Terral's reply << I wish your statement included evidence where this has taken place. I am just as willing to fight for your right to believe in nothing. Even with the moment of silent prayer in place, who forced any religion on any of your kids? If you are threatened by the children of professing Christians taking a moment for a public expression of their faith, then perhaps your belief system requires some updating, or something a bit more substantial, or something. I am sorry, but the public school environment is a microcosm of our society. Sooner or later they are likely to actually see another person praying, even if they never do at home. Take away prayer and give them all condoms: that's the ticket. \n \n Shocked << A democrocay (last I checked this is what America is) does indeed have majority rule, but we also have...minority rights. I hope everyone understands the two pillars this \"great nation\" was founded on. At least that's what I was taught, and have since come to admire and understand.\n \n Terral's reply << Actually, this is also a big misconception. Do you remember the Pledge? Was our allegiance to \"the democracy for which it stands?\" We live in a republic under laws, and not in a democracy under people. \n \n Shocked << 3. What exactly are \"Christians\" like yourself, not allowed to do? You can pray anywhere you like, you just can't force goverment sponsored institutions to promote your religion...ANY religion. \n \n Terral's reply << This is the straw man of many atheists seeking to prohibit the free expression of religion in this country. Government has no place in establishing or prohibiting the free exercise of religion . . . PERIOD. Prayer in public schools has been going on since before I was born. Enacting change through any act of congress or judge is absolutely illegal, according to the law. And yet, we are currently watching all references to God, the cross, Ten Commandments, etc. being systematically removed from public places. \n \n Shocked << You can pray in school, you know that, right? You just can't force other kids to. You think this is wrong? Please tell me it's all just a big misunderstanding.\n \n Terral's reply << These above mentioned historical and religious artifacts are being erased and blotted out in violation of the First Amendment. You have no problem with the systematic erosion of personal freedoms in this country? How about when they begin aggressively destroying our personal liberties guaranteed under the Second Amendment, and our right to bear arms? No sir.

Removing all traces of God from public places is not an option. The atheists are going to keep pushing, until one day the go a bit too far; if they have not gone too far already.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral\n\n \n That's a lot of writing for my quick three sentences! \n \n 1. Tradition or \"being done this way before you were born\", has nothing to do with something being constitutional or unconstitutional. Sorry. And yes, an example is slavery. While I'm sure some son of a son of a slave owner would love his field-hands and house servants back under his yoke, it's now, illegal, and unconstitutional. So yes, it doesn't work the way you'd like it to work. Some people call it progress.\n \n 2. Our country being founded on majority rule and minority rights is not a misconception. Type those words into google and let me know what you find, it will be obvious that I didn't dream up what our government is about.\n \n 3. This is the crux of our argument, seriously, this will save you some headaches down the road if you just walk with me here.\n \n - You can pray in school, or anywhere you feel like it.\n - The government should not pass laws or keep laws on the books that respect or establish any religion.\n - Therefore, the government cannot make or uphold a law that requires government (tax payer funded) institutions to respect any religion, which schools are a part of. They cannot make a law that REQUIRES people to pray or respects \"Prayer time\", or any other religious buzz word things.\n \n So, there is no ambiguity there. You can pray in school, it just cannot be MANDATED by the school. I.e. the government cannot tell anyone they need to pray, or worship, or pause and reflect on a higher power. However, you can do these things on your own volition. You see, that's why the law is good, and your desire to see Christianity spread by our government = bad. \n \n 4. Last I checked we had three branches of government, and indeed, you're wrong, judges and congress have a great deal to do with what's legal and what's not. The suprement court's rulings are..supreme, and congress certainly does work hard to get bills turned into laws. So yes, they can make bills that do, well, most anything, and some even become laws. There are checks and balances in place, but yeah, that's their job and stuff.\n \n 5. The ACLU fights for everyone's civil liberties, and they often team up with the Christian Coalition if some religious people or groups get their rights trampled on. They take a lot of negative press for some reason from the religious right...not sure why. Maybe it's because their goal is to fight the \"systematic erosion of our personal freedoms\". That's just an FYI. No, I don't stand by, by the way.\n \n 6. Religion in public places = places paid for by tax payer dollars = government supporting that religion = violation of establishment clause = bad. That's just a reiteration of #3. \n \n 7. The alabama judge you mention is a criminal, and was treated like one. He was in the wrong, in so many ways. And he was taken care of. You don't decide you \"don't like the law\" and just go breaking them. That's called..anarchy, or criminal, or breaking the law..you know the routine.\n \n You've been doing a lot of writing, hope you're not tired out yet! :)\n \n -mach",

   "Greetings Morph:\n \n Thank you for the very good post explaining your well thought out viewpoints. \n \n Morph << Concerning the links you provided: It seems the judge was removed from office for refusing to obey a court order, and not for actually installing the Ten Commandments statue. That is a subtle difference, yes, but a fairly important one. \n \n Terral's reply << I do believe that the Alabama judge did indeed place the monument. \"U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson ruled Monday that the monument INSTALLED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE goes too far in promoting religion and ordered it removed within 30 days.\" The federal judge handed down a judgment that was based upon the interpretation (or misinterpretation) of some law. \n \n The article goes on to say, \"Opponents of the monument argued that it promoted the judge's conservative Christian faith in violation of the Constitution's ban on government establishment of religion.\" Here is where the misinterpretation aspects begin to play out. Judge Moore did not seek to establish any religion. Our First Amendment forbids 'congress' from making laws. Therefore, nothing in the First Amendment applies to this case at all. If the Federal Judge wishes to pass down a legal judgment, then it must not be based upon his or her personal opinions, but it must be supported by some aspect of the law. So which law did Judge Moore break?\n \n Morph << His superior's (you could say the Moore's boss) decided his view on a matter was incorrect. Judge Moore is not the supreme judge of the land... the buck does not stop with him.\n \n Terral's reply << Are you saying that the Federal Judge is the superior of the State Judge? And, are you basing that on these misinterpretations of the First Amendment? If so, then this is the heart of the matter that pertains to this discussion. Congress did not pass any laws in this case. So please deliver for us the law that Judge Moore violated, so that the Federal Judge could then render the unfavorable judgment against him. After all, if the Federal Judge ordered him removed from the bench, and that judgment was based upon an illegal interpretation of the law, then Judge Moore's rights have been violated. \n \n Morph << But then again maybe you're arguing that the federal government should not meddle in the affairs of how a state government should run its state. In that case I would agree with you, I think the federal government should get out of the business of decided how states should run their state (making the Federal Marriage Amendment bogus... but that's neither here nor there). \n \n Terral's reply << No sir. I am for the federal judges intervening in state cases where laws have been broken. However, I want to know precisely what law Judge Moore violated. Thus far it appears that he ****** off some atheists who originated a federal lawsuit, which prompted the Federal Judge to misapply the First Amendment to this case. Therefore, the original judgment to remove the monument was illegal. The judgment to remove Judge Moore from the bench was based upon an illegal judgment, and was also illegal. This does not even begin to address the issue of Judge Moore's First Amendment rights of freedom of expression. \n \n Morph << However (you knew it was coming) if a state government passes a law, or performs an action that undermines the federal constitution, then the action or law is not permissible. If a state constitution allowed for a ban on gun ownership, and a law was passed putting into effect a ban on gun ownership, the federal government would have the power to step in and overrule the ban. In this case the district judge found the monument to be unconstitutional, and so it was in his power to tell Moore what to do. \n \n Terral's reply << Your writing skills appear very precise, when supporting your own views, and conveniently the opposite when the rights of others are being walked upon. The monument has no rights in this or any other case. Laws and judgments (not inanimate objects) are either constitutional or they are not. The placement of this particular monument does not equate to congress passing any law. Nor did placing the statue violate anyone's freedom of religion. Therefore, you can misinterpret and misapply the First Amendment to this case to validate the end you seek. Even though both of us know full well that there is nothing legal about it. \n \n Morph << If you want to continue the idea that there the government actually can pass laws that support religions, or subtly support one religion over another, then fine. We'll discuss that. But digest the above first. \n \n Terral's reply << No sir. Thus far I am standing firmly with the statement of GreatMoose and his comment about the misinterpretation of the First Amendment. \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << What about the rights of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, and the God fearing folks from the great state of Alabama? \n \n Morph << Since he was acting as a government official, in the setting of a government building, his actions represent government policy. \n \n Terral's reply << Hogwash. To be removed from the bench, he must have violated a law. You keep saying 'government,' when the wording of the First Amendment says \"congress.\" Government does not equal congress, and Judge Moore did not pass any laws. Again, please remember that this debate is not about whether we agree or disagree with Judge Moore's right to place the monument there in the first place. It is about how the Federal Judge applied the First Amendment to this case. 'That is a subtle difference, yes, but a fairly important one.'\n \n Morph << He is free to erect a statue of the Ten Commandments on his front porch if he feels like it. \n \n Terral's reply << Our First Amendment rights begin at home, but do not cease to exist on our front porches. What reason was given for the installation of the monument in the first place? \"The chief justice testified during the trial that the commandments are the moral foundation of American law. He said he installed the monument partly because of his concern that the country has suffered a moral decline over the past 40 or 50 years as a result of federal court rulings, including those against prayer in public schools.\" From the article: \n \n http://www.abcactionnews.com/stories/2002/11/021119tencomm.shtml. \n \n The Federal Judge is reported to have said, \"Thompson said he does not believe all Ten Commandment displays in government buildings are illegal, but he said the monument Moore placed in the rotunda of the state building crosses the line \"between the permissible and the impermissible.\"\n \n So the placing of Ten Commandment displays in government buildings is not illegal, but this Federal Judge believes this particular monument crosses the line. Okay, what line? Criminals cross the line the moment they commit an illegal act and break a particular law. In jury trials, it is not for the judge to determine innocence or guilt. That is the duty of the jury in the case. The judge is there to ensure that the law is properly applied to the case. That is all fine and dandy. Again, which law did Judge Moore break? \n \n Morph << In the same way any individual can be as much of a bigot as they please. However when acting as a government representative, they are not entitled to express those views. \n \n Terral's reply << More hogwash. Judge Moore was not being an extremist or racist in any way, and bigotry has nothing to do with this case. He sat in a position that gave him a good perspective on what he perceived to be a terrible problem. He associated the moral decline in his home state with terrible decisions rendered by the same Federal Judicial branch that removed him from the bench. This case is about a Christian State Judge and his ******* contest with the all powerful Federal Judge and the atheists who used him by initiating the law suit. You will convince me that Judge Moore deserved to be removed from the bench, the moment you let us all know the laws he has broken. \n \n Morph << A private store owner can refuse service to a black patron simply because they are black... but to deny justice to someone because of their skin color is unconstitutional. And in the same way that Moore didn't actually pass any laws, discriminating against black people in a court room is not actually passing a law... but this still makes it a violation of the constitution. \n \n Terral' s reply << Well, your post shines in some places, and not so much in others. Judge Moore did not violate anything in our Constitution. The Federal Judge has yet to prove to me that the State Judge did one thing against the law. The evidence seems to indicate that the Federal Judge misapplied the First Amendment to this case, and then based the judgment to remove Moore from the bench on that illegal decision. \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << Removing God's name and religious symbols from everything in America is not going to guarantee you anything. \n \n Morph << Hmm... I guess I'll have to explicitly state my beliefs in their entirety before I can expect you to make a fairly simple logical step. \n \n Terral's reply << Do not patronize me. The things of the spirit are foolishness to the natural man. Scripture says, \"But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one.\" 1Cor. 2:14+15. \n \n Morph << I would not support any kind of government action to modify any kind of symbol from the private sector. So I don't want to remove God's name and religious symbols from everything in America. I just want to remove them from government agencies that explicitly state they will not have such symbols.\n \n Terral's reply << You would remove these symbols, based upon what law? The government is 'We The People.' The people we elect to represent us are well capable of determining the need of the moment, and have every right to freely exercise their faith in any way they see fit. Congress is forbidden to pass any law that prohibits the free exercise of religion . . . period. Federal Judges are to apply those laws to each individual case, and outside the law they have no jurisdiction whatsoever. Therefore, before you can go around and remove anything from our public places, you must prove to some judge someplace that a law has been violated. \n \n Morph << As you may or may not have noticed above (about Moore and the ten commandments) I didn't say one way or the other whether I thought what he did was right or wrong, or even if the ten commandments should be there. I just said that the federal government had jurisdiction, and they acted on it. \n \n Terral's reply << Again, I will agree with you the instant that you show us which law Moore violated. \n \n Morph << As far as the term \"God\" in the pledge, I don't know about your state, but I feel that my state (California) is pretty clear on weather something of that nature should be allowed. \n \n Terral's reply << Okay. What is the atheist position on which law was violated in regard to \"God\" being part of the Pledge? \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << I am very sorry that all of you atheists in America were born into a country that has adhered to Judeo-Christian values from day one. \n \n Morph << As a side note, when examining the ten commandments not even half of them are actually expressed in US law. \n \n Terral's reply << The content of the Ten Commandments is irrelevant to this discussion. This is about the decision of the Federal Judge to remove Judge Moore from office, and any law that Moore violated. Did Moore violate anything in the First Amendment by placing the monument? Was the Federal Judge's judgment to remove it legal or illegal? Did the Federal Judge accurately apply the First Amendment to this case? Or, did he misinterpret the law? \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << However, be mindful of the fact that we are living in a day where homosexuals have sprung aggressively from their closets seeking rights from our government, while at the same time faction groups (not all atheists) from among atheists want to remove God from everything. \n \n Morph << Gasp, gay people are demanding equal rights? \n \n Terral's reply << No sir. Homos already have equal rights. They are included in \"We The People\" already. Both groups are able to marry a member of the opposite sex and have children and grandchildren. The same laws apply to both groups. Homos are seeking extra rights. \n \n Morph << Well if they are entitled to those rights as humans, what is the problem? As for atheists, please find me an atheist who wants you to remove references to God in your private house... and then maybe I'll consider your assertion that any single person wants to remove God from everything. \n \n Terral's reply << Here is where your argument begins to fall apart. Free exercise of speech, religion and press is for everyone everywhere in this country. Those things do not stop at the front porch. The homos are the ones who belong in the closet. But now, they are free to parade their deviant behavior in the streets. According to you, it is Christians who are free to express their religion, but only at home. So your equal rights BS above is not holding water here. \n \n Morph << You do realize that government buildings and organizations are very different from the individuals that the constitution provided for... right?\n \n Terral's reply << Are you referring to our 'Public' buildings where our duly elected officials work daily in representing 'We The People?' When exactly did our elected officials cease to also be 'We The People?' And when did our Constitution stop protecting their right to exercise their free speech, religion, etc.? Judge Moore saw the need to place this monument, and he acted within his Constitutional right to freedom of expression. If the people of Alabama felt that Judge Moore was wrong, then they had it within their power to remove him from office. \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << However, our elected officials (like Judge Roy Moore and everyone else) have the right to freely exercise their faith in any way they see fit, under the First Amendment. \n \n Morph << Including giving harsher sentences to homosexuals because their behavior is an abomination? \n \n Terral's reply << Why divert attention from the subject at hand? Are you saying that the tradition of atheists running to Federal Judges in order to remove state judges from state benches is somehow hurting other atheists who do actually violate the law? A person's sexual orientation need never be an issue, if they practice such things in the same place where you would have Christians exercise their personal freedoms. \n \n Morph << Or awarding custody to the father (aka leader of the household) over the mother for no reason at all? \n \n Terral's reply << Where did that come from? That was a shot to deep left field . . . going . . . going . . . \n \n Morph << As a representative of the government, their first and foremost responsibility is to uphold the ideals of the constitution and the government of the United States. \n \n Terral's reply << Their duty is to accurately apply the laws that 'are' passed by congress. \n \n Morph << In this case their religion does not come first, and their religion can not come first. When there is a conflict between the two ideals, the constitution will win. \n \n Terral's reply << Not in every case. The rights of Judge Moore were violated, when he was ordered to remove the monument. He had violated no law. Then, the judgment to remove him from the bench was also a violation of his rights. \n \n Originally Posted by Terral << Again, I am sorry that you were born into a country established by God fearing men with a Judeo-Christian value system. And yet thousands and thousands have died, and continue to give their lives, to preserve your right to believe in absolutely nothing. \n \n Morph << In your world it would be somehow tragic if the government represented a religious view that was different form yours... \n \n Terral's reply << If frogs had wings, they would not bump their butts every time they hopped. I have lived in other countries, and would gladly move, if this one became overrun with atheists. We should both remember that everyone is an unbeliever right up to the moment that they believe the gospel. There is a cure for your condition.\n \n Morph << However when others are subjected to the same situation it's just an unfortunate circumstance. \n \n Terral's reply << I believe your assertion here to be invalid. What is unfortunate about rubbing shoulders with a member of the typical God-fearing, church-going, Bible-thumping Christian? Are Christian values necessarily bad? I do believe you could be born into a situation that is far worse. \n \n Morph << I am not fighting for an atheistic country, but rather a religiously neutral country. When given the choice between \"God\", \"No God\" and silence, I choose for the government to be silent. Please tell me you understand the distinction.\n \n Terral's reply << No sir. Our founding fathers were religious or they were not. The freedom to exercise one's own faith is part of the First Amendment, because the majority (if not all) were definitely religious and held to spiritual truths. Every single one of us has the right to exercise their faith (or lack thereof) in any way we see fit, or we do not. There is no sitting on the fence. \n \n Since you side with the Federal Judge in this particular case, then your words here do not match your convictions. Had the Federal Judge accurately interpreted the First Amendment, in his dealings with Judge More, then he would have supported his right to freely exercise and express himself. Thompson stated for the record that, \"he does not believe all Ten Commandment displays in government buildings are illegal.\" And yet he ruled otherwise in this particular case. All of the people have the right to freedom of religion all the time. That is the meaning of the First Amendment words \"free exercise thereof.\"\n \n For the record, again: Bill of Rights Amendment I\n \n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or PROHIBITING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "So which law did Judge Moore break?\n\n \n Concerning his removal from office, the law he broke was refusing to obey a court order. This is not the same as being removed from office for supporting a religion. Regardless of how appropriate the original order was to remove the 10 commandments monument, he was still at fault for disobeying the court order. \n \n \nAre you saying that the Federal Judge is the superior of the State Judge? And, are you basing that on these misinterpretations of the First Amendment? If so...\n\n \n Yes the federal judge is the superior of the state judge in some instances. The federal judge issued a court order, and Moore refused to follow the instructions of the order. That really is that. \n \n \nI am for the federal judges intervening in state cases where laws have been broken. \n\n \n He did not obey a court order. If he had a problem with the district judges order then the next course of action was to appeal the decision. He did that and his case was not heard. Not hearing the case is different from ruling in Moore's favor. \n \n \nTherefore, the original judgment to remove the monument was illegal. The judgment to remove Judge Moore from the bench was based upon an illegal judgment, and was also illegal. \n\n \n Then the proper course of action is to appeal the decision, not take matters into your own hands. \n \n \n Hogwash. To be removed from the bench, he must have violated a law. You keep saying 'government,' when the wording of the First Amendment says \"congress.\" Government does not equal congress, and Judge Moore did not pass any laws. \n\n \n The first amendment, along with the fourteenth amendment prohibits state government from passing laws respecting establishments of religion.\n \n \nAgain, please remember that this debate is not about whether we agree or disagree with Judge Moore's right to place the monument there in the first place. It is about how the Federal Judge applied the First Amendment to this case. 'That is a subtle difference, yes, but a fairly important one.'\n\n \n well, I think we're covering 3 points. 1) whether Moore violated any laws. 2) whether the federal court had jurisdiction and 3) whether moore has to obey court orders... regardless of their legality from 1 and 2, I haven't seen you make any objections about point 3... so can I assume you agree that he was justifiably removed from office?\n Going back to point 2 however, the fourteenth amendment makes the constitution a limiting document for both the federal government, and the state governments. \n \n \nThe Federal Judge is reported to have said, \"Thompson said he does not believe all Ten Commandment displays in government buildings are illegal, but he said the monument Moore placed in the rotunda of the state building crosses the line \"between the permissible and the impermissible.\"\n \n So the placing of Ten Commandment displays in government buildings is not illegal, but this Federal Judge believes this particular monument crosses the line. Okay, what line?\n\n \n It's the federal judges job to decide where that line is and when it's crossed. This decision is based on the law, the constitution, and relevant legal precedents. \n \n \nCriminals cross the line the moment they commit an illegal act and break a particular law. In jury trials, it is not for the judge to determine innocence or guilt. That is the duty of the jury in the case. The judge is there to ensure that the law is properly applied to the case.\n\n \n Do I have to cite examples and reasons why some court cases are not heard in front of a panel of jurors, and why there are courts other than the criminal court?\n \n \n Judge Moore was not being an extremist or racist in any way, and bigotry has nothing to do with this case. \n\n \n I was giving an example of how there is nothing wrong with some personal freedoms being limited in some instances... especially when government officials are concerned. \n \n I was NOT claming that Moore is some how a bigot or a racist. \n \n \nWell, your post shines in some places, and not so much in others. Judge Moore did not violate anything in our Constitution. The Federal Judge has yet to prove to me that the State Judge did one thing against the law. The evidence seems to indicate that the Federal Judge misapplied the First Amendment to this case, and then based the judgment to remove Moore from the bench on that illegal decision. \n\n \n have you read the federal judge's decision? The first line reads: \"The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, made binding upon the States through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, provides that government \"shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\"\"\n \n \n Do not patronize me. \n\n \n I apologize. I will not intentionally patronize you again.\n \n \nOkay. What is the atheist position on which law was violated in regard to \"God\" being part of the Pledge? \n\n \n well I don't know about the \"atheist\" position... honestly \"God\" in the pledge doesn't bother me a whole lot. I object to it more on principle than anything else. \n \n But from a legal standpoint, the California constitution reads (Article 9, Section 8) :\n \n \"... nor shall any sectarian or denominational doctrine be taught, or instruction thereon be permitted, directly or indirectly, in any of the common schools of this State.\"\n \n \nThe content of the Ten Commandments is irrelevant to this discussion. This is about the decision of the Federal Judge to remove Judge Moore from office, and any law that Moore violated. \n\n \n yes I recognize it's largely irrelevant. That's why I mentioned it as a side note. \n \n \n No sir. Homos already have equal rights. They are included in \"We The People\" already. Both groups are able to marry a member of the opposite sex and have children and grandchildren. The same laws apply to both groups. Homos are seeking extra rights. \n\n \n I don't want to get into this with you here. Have you been posing on the Gay Rights forum?\n \n \nAccording to you, it is Christians who are free to express their religion, but only at home. So your equal rights BS above is not holding water here.\n \n \n I stated in post 9 on this thread:\n \n I ... have no problem with you practicing your religion in any way you want (provided of course it does not take away my, or anyone else's personal freedoms). You can pray in public, pray in private, pray for me or to me, or even try to convince me to start praying. You can even send your kids off to school and have them pray. \n \n \n To characterize me the way you did in the above manner is completely contradictory to what I have stated on this thread. \n \n My only qualm is when government officials acting in the name of the government show significant support for a religious view. \n \n \nIf the people of Alabama felt that Judge Moore was wrong, then they had it within their power to remove him from office. \n\n \n In addition to that a minority had the right to bring his behavior in front of a federal judge and request that the federal judge issue a court order. In addiction to that a panel of judges had the power to review his disregard for the court order, and remove him from office. The people voting is not the only method of making changes or getting things done. \n \n \nHowever, our elected officials (like Judge Roy Moore and everyone else) have the right to freely exercise their faith in any way they see fit, under the First Amendment. \n\n \n YOU even don't have a free pass to do anything you want because of the first amendment. When acting as a government official rights are even more limited. \n \n \n Why divert attention from the subject at hand? Are you saying that the tradition of atheists running to Federal Judges in order to remove state judges from state benches is somehow hurting other atheists who do actually violate the law? \n\n \n It's an analogy. A judge's constitutional rights are limited when doing their job. This goes from how they can design their court houses, to how they pass sentences. \n \n \n Where did that come from? That was a shot to deep left field . . . going . . . going . . . \n\n \n again, a judge's constitutional rights are limited when they are doing their jobs. The above was an example. \n \n \n Thompson stated for the record that, \"he does not believe all Ten Commandment displays in government buildings are illegal.\" And yet he ruled otherwise in this particular case.\n\n \n Please... how can you equate \"Not all Ten Commandment displays are illegal\" to \"all Ten Commandment displays are illegal\". \n \n Saying \"not all\" means it excludes some cases... obviously judge Thompson thought this was one of those cases... and so no contradiction is present.\n \n \nAll of the people have the right to freedom of religion all the time. That is the meaning of the First Amendment words \"free exercise thereof.\"\n\n \n This does not give me the right to erect stone monuments on your front porch. And please don't view that example so narrowly as to suggest that I'm saying Judge Moore tried to put the Ten Commandments on my front porch, or the government building is some how my property. Our inalienable freedoms are not completely and totally free. Do you disagree?",
