   "Why the Old Labels Don't Stick\n \n Left, right, center? With Bush and Kerry, there's a lot to be confused about \n \n BY ANDREW SULLIVAN\n \n Posted Sunday, October 24, 2004\n Why is this election so hard for so many people? Here's one theory. It's not so easy to tell who's the liberal and who's the conservative anymore. You want a candidate who pumps unprecedented amounts of money into agricultural subsidies, uses tariffs to protect some American industries and adds a whole new entitlement to Medicare? That would be the, er, Republican, George W. Bush.\n \n You want a future President who will be hard nosed about committing U.S. troops abroad, wants to balance every new spending item with a tax hike or a spending cut elsewhere and backs states' rights on social issues? Then go ahead and vote for the, er, Democrat, John Kerry.\n \n You think there's too little federal control over education? Vote Bush. Want to expand health-care coverage primarily through the private sector? Vote Kerry.\n \n Confused yet? You're not the only one. For conservatives there's plenty to worry about in Bush's record. By any measure, the government is bigger, more powerful and more intrusive than when he found it. Domestic spending has gone up at a greater rate than under any other President since Lyndon Johnson. The President hasn't found a single spending bill he wanted to veto. And he cannot even blame Congress. His own party controls all of it. In foreign policy, conservatives have long tended to be realists, acting only in response to hard-faced national interest, exercising prudence and caution, only reluctantly intervening in other countries' affairs. That's the kind of conservative Bush campaigned as in 2000, lambasting \"nation building\" in the debates and calling for fewer troops than Al Gore did.\n \n In office, however, spurred by 9/11, Bush has become a Kennedy-style Democrat, trying to turn two violence-wracked countries, Iraq and Afghanistan, into democracies by military force. He has reversed decades of U.S. policy by launching two pre-emptive wars, backing democracy at the risk of making the Middle East even more unstable and ignoring the U.N. and other allies when he believed they were wrong. He backed a new military theory that argued that you could fight and win wars with relatively few troops. The old, more cautious doctrine-inherited from the first President Bush and Colin Powell-was always to use overwhelming force for very narrow ends. Bush junked this military conservatism in favor of something far bolder and riskier.\n \n You can see why these shifts occurred. Sept. 11 changed everything, including Bush. And you can see how a recession prompted Bush to spend more money while he was lowering taxes at the same time. But the postwar reality in Iraq has also proved some conservative instincts right: it is indeed hard to export democracy where none has existed. And it is hard to keep order in a huge, unstable country with dangerously low troop levels. As for Bush's spree of spending and borrowing, as baby boomers face retirement and Medicare and Social Security begin to bust the budget, his lack of discipline looks like recklessness.\n \n Liberals have a few worries of their own when it comes to Kerry. He vows to continue a war in Iraq that many of them opposed. He's against gay marriage and says he will cut any new spending programs if necessary to balance the budget. He reminds voters he was an altar boy, shoots defenseless geese in Ohio and is very close to Bill Clinton's economic adviser, Robert Rubin, a man Wall Street loves. In foreign policy Kerry also strikes a traditionalist tone that is not out of place among old-school, Powell-style Republicans. He says he will go back to our old alliances and increase troop levels worldwide by 40,000.\n \n There are times when Kerry seems as if he's promising a return to the foreign policy of the first President Bush rather than that of the radical son. He's less radical than his opponent on Social Security (he says he'll leave it alone, while Bush wants to reform it). He will leave Roe v. Wade in place, and he will undo Bush's fusion of government money with religious charitable groups. Whatever else Kerry is running as, it's not as a radical. In fact, Kerry seems the more conservative figure. In the debates, he was calmer, cooler and less prone to rapid personality shifts. It was Bush who seemed like the fidgety usurper. But style reflects substance. It's Bush who has radically recast the G.O.P. as a Big Government, religiously motivated tool for transforming the world. Kerry has merely campaigned on a return to Clinton-era centrism in domestic policy and old-Republican realism in foreign policy.\n \n The question we face in this election is therefore a truly befuddling one: In a world in crisis, is there a greater risk in Bush's radicalism or Kerry's conservatism? And what do right and left mean anymore, anyway?\n\n \n http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101041101/nandrew.html\n \n Also, check these Slides out to find out where each party stands, and get away from the talking points and distortions that most people hold.",

   "I personally don't like either of these wankers, and like the article. It does seem to carry some factual errors, though, as well as some irrational ones. \n \n \nYou think there's too little federal control over education? Vote Bush. Want to expand health-care coverage primarily through the private sector? Vote Kerry.\n\n \n Kerry is talking about massive federal giveawys to update private record keeping, and offering anybody who can't get insurance through their jobs access to the Federal Employees Health Plan, basically creating a huge government run insurance program. You can bet your bottom dollar that, if this is the case, many employers will cease to offer insurance to their employees, since they can get cheap insurance from the federal government. He is also proposing the federal government picking up 100% of the tab for including all children in medicare who are in families that make up to 300% of poverty level. This is not exactly \"expanding health-care coverage primarily through the private sector\".\n \n Bush on the other hand is advocating health savings accounts, tax credits to small businesses to help cover employees (in private insurance groups) , expanding association health plans, and breaking down state barriers for insurance. This is definatly \"expanding health-care coverage primarily through the private sector\".\n \n \nConfused yet? You're not the only one. For conservatives there's plenty to worry about in Bush's record. By any measure, the government is bigger, more powerful and more intrusive than when he found it. Domestic spending has gone up at a greater rate than under any other President since Lyndon Johnson. The President hasn't found a single spending bill he wanted to veto. And he cannot even blame Congress. His own party controls all of it.

That's the kind of conservative Bush campaigned as in 2000, lambasting \"nation building\" in the debates and calling for fewer troops than Al Gore did.\n\n \n The part about the government being bigger, more powerful, and more intrusive is definatly correct. The part about not vetoing is also factually correct, but fails to mention the fact that the congress is pretty much a bunch of lap dogs lately, they haven't passed a single bill that Bush hasn't supported from the start.\n \n I also think it is more than a little misleading to say that republicans have \"only reluctantly intervened in other countries' affairs\". Republicans have been intervening in other nations affairs for years, they just aren't upfront enough about it to call out the military. Generally they seem to prefer subterfuge, bribery, predatory trade \"agreements\" and other such diabolic means to exert control. \n \n \nIn office, however, spurred by 9/11, Bush has become a Kennedy-style Democrat, trying to turn two violence-wracked countries, Iraq and Afghanistan, into democracies by military force. He has reversed decades of U.S. policy by launching two pre-emptive wars, backing democracy at the risk of making the Middle East even more unstable and ignoring the U.N. and other allies when he believed they were wrong.

The old, more cautious doctrine-inherited from the first President Bush and Colin Powell-was always to use overwhelming force for very narrow ends. Bush junked this military conservatism in favor of something far bolder and riskier.\n\n \n This is all pretty much correct as far as I can tell, which is why I think Bush is a bad president. Of course, that doesn't mean I support kerry. I would rather have Koko the talking gorilla than either of those guys.\n \n \nLiberals have a few worries of their own when it comes to Kerry. He vows to continue a war in Iraq that many of them opposed. He's against gay marriage and says he will cut any new spending programs if necessary to balance the budget. He reminds voters he was an altar boy, shoots defenseless geese in Ohio and is very close to Bill Clinton's economic adviser, Robert Rubin, a man Wall Street loves. In foreign policy Kerry also strikes a traditionalist tone that is not out of place among old-school, Powell-style Republicans. He says he will go back to our old alliances and increase troop levels worldwide by 40,000.\n\n \n I think that trying to paint kerry as a conservative here is absurd. He record simply doesnlt support it. he is simply doing what American politicians have always done, lying to get elected.",

Pretty sure I don't like the finances of that plan. \n\n \n I know I don't like them. Here is the relevant portion from times page, foor those who want to see it but don't want to wade throught the crappy slideshow type presentation:\n \n \nBUSH: The President proposes creating \"health savings accounts.\" Funded by tax-free salary deductions, those accounts, similar to 401(k)s, would pay for out-of-pocket health expenses under a low-premium, high-deductible insurance plan. Bush argues that because workers would pay for routine care, they would use medical services more judiciously, thereby reducing overall costs. To encourage enrollment, Bush would allow businesses to deduct contributions to the plans from their taxes. He would offer tax credits for low-income workers who can't otherwise afford health care. Believing medical-malpractice premiums are driving up health-care costs, he wants to cap punitive damages in malpractice suits at $250,000. \n \n KERRY: Kerry proposes two policies to make health insurance cheaper for companies and therefore, presumably, more available to workers: a tax credit to offset the costs for small businesses and a program in which the government would take over 75% of the cost of catastrophic care. To lower prescription-drug prices, Kerry says, he would allow Medicare to negotiate with drugmakers and permit the reimportation of drugs from Canada. Kerry promises to make health insurance available to every American child by funding an expansion of state child health insurance. Cost estimates for Kerry's health plan range from $650 billion to more than $1 trillion. \n \n \n Definatly sounds like bush wins the \"conservative\" label ont his particular issue, though even his plan is not all that conservative.\n \n \nPerhaps, but neither Bush nor Kerry are very conservative. \n \n \n I don't mean to iply that he was. Neither guy here is a conservative.\n \n \nWankers..hahahaha\n\n \n Couldn't think of a better word that would still make it through the potty mouth filter",
