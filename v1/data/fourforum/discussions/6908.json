   "Well, to tell the truth Americans and their coalition partners are applying them actively, especially in Kosovo and B&G. I think you know that as a result of war in Yugoslavia this country was torn into pieces (Kosovo, Bosnia and others). Americans and the rest of the NATO are trying to carry out the policy of double standards. Well, they consider that the Albans are friendly and loyal but Serbs are spiteful and two-faced! As a result of it when recruiting civil workers to support the KFOR Albans are preferred. Moreover if a Serb gets a job and does something wrong Americans use hard disciplinary standards (dismissal without reinstatement), but nothing like this has ever happened to an Alban. This is a short episode only. But in global scale US and NATO mission in Kosovo have done nothing bring down tensions in this important district for Europe, but they surely intensified ethnic antagonisms, which pushes Kosovo to turning into a base of international terrorism.",
