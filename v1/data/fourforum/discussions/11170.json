   "And speaking of imbedded anomalies, here's an interesting link that has to make you go hmmmm, at the very least. I realize that few if any of these can be verified, but they are interesting none the less. I posted discoveries up to the 20th century.\n \n http://www.bibleufo.com/articleembedded.htmEmbedded Anomalies\n Evidence of Civilization Before the Accepted Creation Timeline\n By\n Patrick Cooke\n \n From ancient geological strata comes what have been labeled OOPARTS, or Out Of Place Artifacts. These are what appear to be recently produced items and imprints found in natural mineral formations millions of years old. Conservative historians and archaeologists, who hold to the concept of linear cultural development, point to the ancient Middle East as the home of the very first metal production. Here, they claim, man began to melt and shape copper, iron, gold, and silver only 8,000 years ago. \n \n 1572 From the Archives of Madrid a letter dated 1572, comes the account of the Spanish Viceroy in Peru and a strange artifact, which came into his possession. A perfect six-inch nail was later presented to the Viceroy as a souvenir, who had it thoroughly examined, and verified it was found in rock dated to 75,000 to 100,000 years in age.\n \n 1820 From The American Journal of Science and Arts, 1820 comes the account of an ancient tool discovery. At a quarry near Aixen-Provence, France, in 1788, 40 or 50 feet below ground in a layer of limestone were found coins, petrified wooden handles of hammers, pieces of other petrified wooden tools, and a quarrymen's board. The limestone was 300 million years old.\n \n 1822 The American Journal of Science from 1822, north of Pittsburgh an unusually flat rectangular surface, 3 feet long and varying from 5 to 6 inches wide was found. On this flat surface were row after row of evenly spaced, perfect diamond shapes, each with an oblique, raised band across its center. The pattern is too precise to be natural, the diamond shapes too square to be designed by anything but an intelligent hand. In fragments of the impressed rock, were found fossils of primitive jointed plants, dating the find to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago.\n \n 1822 The American Journal of Science, 1822 reported a number of man track impressions on an outcrop of grayish-blue crinoidal limestone along the west bank of the Mississippi for 3 miles just south of St. Louis. The foot lengths were 10 1/2 inches wide.\n \n 1826 In a well dug near the Ohio River in north Cincinnati at a level 94 feet down, a buried tree stump was found which showed the marks of an ax. The marks were deep and well cut, indicating the use of a sharp and durable blade. The ax used was confirmed to have been made of metal when, embedded in the top of the stump, an advanced oxidized wedge of iron was found. The layer in which the stump was found was dated to be between 50,000 and 75,000 years old nearly 10 times the accepted age of the supposed first metal usage.\n \n 1829 From the American Journal of Science, an account sent by a correspondent, to Prof. Silliman, of something that was found in a block of marble, taken November 1829, from a quarry, near Philadelphia. The block was cut into slabs. By this process, it is said, was exposed an indentation in the stone, about one and a half inches by five-eighths of an inch. A geometric indentation: in it were two definite-looking raised letters, like 'I U': only difference is that the corners of the 'U' are not rounded, but are right angles. We are told that this block of stone came from a depth of seventy or eighty feet---or that, if acceptable, this lettering was done long ago.\n \n 1844 On June 22, 1844, this curious report appeared in the London Times: \"A few days ago, as some workmen were employed in quarrying a rock close to the Tweed about a quarter of a mile below Rutherford-mill, a gold thread was discovered embedded in the stone at a depth of eight feet.\" Dr. A. W. Medd of the British Geological Survey wrote in 1985 that this stone is of Early Carboniferous age between 320 and 360 million years old. Who dropped this gold thread in the ancient fern forests in a distant time when the most advanced life forms on the planet where amphibians and insects?\n \n 1845 From a communication by Sir David Brewster, 1845, a nail had been found in a block of stone from Kingoodie Quarry, North Britain. The block in which the nail was found was nine inches thick. The quarry had been worked about twenty years. It consisted of alternate layers of hard stone and a substance called 'till,' The point of the nail, quite eaten with rust, projected into some 'till,' upon the surface of the block of stone. The rest of the nail lay upon the surface of the stone to within an inch of the head---that inch of it was embedded in the stone. \n \n 1851 In the June 1851 issue of Scientific American, a report was reprinted from the Boston Transcript about a metallic vase dynamited out of solid rock in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The bell-shaped vase was 4 1/2 inches high, 6 1/2 inches at the base, 2 1/2 inches at the top and an eighth of an inch thick. The metal of the vase was composed of an alloy of zinc and a considerable portion of silver. On the sides were six figures of a flower in bouquet arrangements, inlaid with pure silver, and around the lower part a vine, or wreath, also inlaid with silver. The chasing, carving, and inlaying are exquisitely done by the art of some unknown craftsman. This vase was blown out of solid pudding stone from 15 feet below the surface. The estimated age was 100,000 years.\n \n 1851 In Whiteside County, Illinois two copper artifacts, a hook, and a ring were brought up during the drilling of a well from a sand stratum 120 feet deep. The stratum was dated at 150,000 years old.\n \n 1851 The London Times, December 1851: Hiram De Witt, of Springfield, Mass. dropped a piece of auriferous quartz about the size of a man's fist. It split open and there was found inside a cut-iron nail, slightly corroded and the size of a six-penny nail. It was entirely straight and had a perfect head.'\"\n \n 1852 Scientific American, June 1852. During blasting work at Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1851, the broken halves of a bell - shaped vessel were thrown by the force of an explosion from the vessel's resting place within a bed of formerly solid rock. The vase, about 4 1/2 inches high, was made of an unknown metal and embellished with floral inlays of silver - the art of some cunning craftsman.\n \n 1853 A horned lizard was found inside a block of stone, in New Mexico, in 1853. The stone was \"so solid as to preclude the entrance of the smallest insect\". The lizard was sent to the Smithsonian Institute, where it died 2 days later.\n \n 1856 The last of the pterodactyls (flying reptiles with leathery wings and long, toothy beaks) died about 100 million years ago, according to established scientific opinion. But in the experience of a number of startled French workmen, the last one died in the winter of 1856 in a partially complete railway tunnel between the St. Dizier and Nancy lines. In the half-light of the tunnel, something monstrous stumbled toward them out of a great boulder of Jurassic limestone they had just split open. It fluttered its wings, croaked, and died at their feet. The creature, whose wingspan was 10 feet 7 inches, had four legs joined by a membrane, like a bat. What should have been feet were long talons, and the mouth was arrayed with sharp teeth. The skin was like black leather, thick and oily. At the nearby town of Gray, the creature was immediately identified by a local student of paleontology as a pterodactyl. The rock stratum in which it had been found was consistent with the period when pterodactyls lived, and the limestone boulder that had imprisoned the winged reptile for millions of years was found to contain a cavity in the form of an exact mold of the creature's body.\n \n 1857 Between 1857 and 1866 in gold mines on Table Mountain, northwest of Needles, California were found bones of extinct mastodons, mammoths, bison, tapirs, horses, rhinos, hippos, and camels, all dating from the Pliocene period. Also found among the fossils was a stone disc used for grinding, a large stone bowl, part of a human crania, a stone mortar a complete human skull. It was determined that the items were 12 million years old. \n \n 1865 A two-inch metal screw was discovered in a piece of feldspar unearthed from the Abbey Mine in Treasure City, Nevada. The screw had long ago oxidized, but its form, particularly the shape of its threads, could be clearly seen in the feldspar. The stone was calculated to be 21 million years in age.\n \n 1865 Excavating for the Hartlepool waterworks in Durham England, in 1865, workmen accidentally freed a living toad from a block of magnesian limestone 25 feet down.\n \n 1867 At the Rocky Point Mine, in Gilman, Colorado, at a depth of 400 feet excavators found human bones embedded in a silver vein and a well-tempered copper arrowhead. The vein was dated at 135 million years old. \n \n 1867 It is reported that James Parsons, and his two sons, exhumed a slate wall in a coal mine at Hammondville, Ohio, in 1868. It was a large smooth wall, disclosed when a great mass of coal fell away from it, and on its surface, carved in bold relief, were several lines of hieroglyphics. \n \n 1869 The Los Angeles News of December 17, 1869 reported a smooth slate wall covered with strange alphabetic writing had been discovered in a coalmine at a depth of 100 feet. The letters were raised and well defined. The coal that had covered the wall bore their distinct impression, which means the letters date to a time when the coal was in a vegetable state and had molded itself against the wall. Each sign was three-quarters of an inch in size, and arranged in rows precisely spaced 3 inches apart. The coal was from the Carboniferous era, well over 200 million years old.\n \n 1870 At Lawn Ridge, 20 miles north of Peoria, Illinois, in August of 1870, as a well was being drilled the pump brought up a small metal medallion to the surface. The strange coin / medallion was composed of an unidentified copper alloy, about the size and thickness of a U.S. quarter of that period. It was remarkably uniform in thickness, round, and the edges appeared to have been cut. Researcher William E. Dubois, who presented his investigation of the medallion to the American Philosophical Society, was convinced that the object had in fact passed through a rolling mill, the edges showed clear evidence of the machining. Both sides of the medallion were marked with artwork and hieroglyphs that had somehow been etched in acid, to a remarkable degree of intricacy. One side showed the figure of a woman wearing a crown or headdress; her left arm is raised as if in benediction, and her right arm holds a small child, also crowned. The woman appears to be speaking. On the opposite side is another central figure, a crouching animal wth long, pointed ears, large eyes and mouth, claw-like arms, and a long tail frayed at the very end. Below and to the left of it is another animal, which bears a strong resemblance to a horse. Around the outer edges of both sides of the coin are undecipherable glyphs - they are of very definite character, and show all the signs of a form of alphabetic writing. The stratum from which the coin was extracted was dated between 100,000 and 150,000 years.\n \n 1877 Prospectors near Eureka, Nevada found a human leg bone and kneecap sticking out of solid rock. Doctors examined the remains and determined they were from a very modern-looking human being, and one that stood over 12 feet tall. The rock in which the bones were found was dated geologically to the Jurassic Period, over 185 million years old. \n \n 1877 Prospectors near Eureka, Nevada found a human leg bone and kneecap sticking out of solid rock. Doctors examined the remains and determined they were from a very modern-looking human being, and one that stood over 12 feet tall. The rock in which the bones were found was dated geologically to the Jurassic Period, over 185 million years old. \n \n 1880 Workmen drilling a well discovered a doll-like figure sometime before 1880 near Marlboro in Stark County, Ohio. The image made of black variegated marble and standing 6 inches tall was unearthed from a depth of 120 feet. The layer in which the doll was found was dated at over 300,000 years.\n \n 1880 Near Loch Maree and Victoria Falls, Scotland, the hollow impression that would be left by double bars of iron placed closely together. was discovered. The observation was corroborated years later when micro-specks of iron oxide were taken from the impression cavities. The bands occur high above the falls in an almost totally inaccessible place, where a \"structure\" would serve little purpose. The sandstone in the impressions show tiny striations, which are really the preserved grain marks of the iron, indicated the metal had been impressed in the primordial sand, before solidification took place. The sandstone in which the bands occur is Cambrian dating to 600 million years old. \n \n 1882 Near Carson City, Nevada, a layer of sandstone was found covered with fossilized animal tracks, including those of an extinct mammoth along with several human tracks were also found. \n \n 1884 The London Times, June 22, 1884: Workmen quarrying rock, close to Tweed, about a quarter of a mile below Rutherford Mills, discovered a gold thread embedded in the stone as a depth of 8 feet.\n \n 1884 Fossilized human tracks were discovered in a rock quarry near Managua, Nicaragua, in a layer containing 16 to 24 feet below the surface, geologically dated as being over 200,000 years of age. \n \n 1885 In the fall of 1885, at an iron foundry near Bocklabruck, Upper Austria, in a piece of brown coal that had been mined from the pits at Wolfsegg, near Schwannstadt, a cube-like metal object was found. The composition is iron, carbon, and a small quantity of nickel. The coal dated to the Tertiary Period making it 60 million years old.\n \n 1885 The American Antiquarian reported a find east of the town of Berea, Kentucky. Preserved in the layer were the fossilized impressions of several creatures, including two well-preserved prints of a human being. They were described as \"good-sized, toes well spread, and very distinctly marked.\" In 1930 geologists discovered a total of twelve 9 1/2-inch human tracks and portions of others, and confirmed that they had indeed been impressed upon gray Pottsville sandstone dating from the Upper Pennsylvanian period dating them at over 300 million years old. One track had a distance from heel to heel of 18 inches, a giant by any standards.\n \n 1885 The American Antiquarian, 1885 gave the account of another find associated with the St. Louis footprints. \"A particular set of tracks was described in detail. Directly before the prints of these feet, within a few inches, is a well-impressed and deep mark, having some resemblance to a scroll, or roll of parchment, two feet long by a foot in width.\" The squared impression was not a natural shape; neither were scratch marks that would have indicated the patch had been carved. Rather, the evidence points to the parchment impression having been made when the rock was still in a plastic state, made at the same time as the footprints. What such a find suggests is that the prints' owners were not only men, but were men with the intelligence to produce some form of paper sheet - and perhaps write upon it. The limestone, in which prints and paper appear, is dated to the Mississippian age dated 345 million years ago.\n \n 1885 A well driller discovered a little clay doll that had come from below a 15-foot layer of lava rock, 100 feet of sand, 6 inches of clay, 40 feet of more sand, then 165 feet composed of clay, sand, clay nodules mixed with sand, and coarse sand layers for a total of 320 feet. The small \"doll\" is composed of half clay and half quartz, and though badly battered by time, the doll's appearance is still distinct. It had a bulbous head, with barely discernible mouth and eyes; broad shoulders; short, thick arms, and long legs, the right leg broken off. There are also faint geometric markings on the figure, which represent either clothing patterns or jewelry. The doll is the image of a person of a high civilization, artistically attired. The layer in which the doll was found was dated at over 300,000 years.\n \n 1891 The June 11th Morrisonville Times reported: \"A curious find was brought to light by Mrs. S. W. Culp last Tuesday morning. As she was breaking a lump of coal preparatory to putting it in the scuttle, she discovered, as the lump fell apart, embedded in a circular shape a small gold chain about ten inches in length of antique and quaint workmanship.\n \n 1891 Near Cleveland, Tennessee a length of wall was discovered which was traced for a thousand feet, on the average 2 feet thick and 8 feet high, with numerous projections spaced along the top every 25 to 30 feet. The wall ran roughly at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees east. The structure continues on beyond the section exposed, in both directions, following the crest of a ridge that extends from the Hiawassee River north of Chattanooga southward, where it dips beneath the Tennessee river. Its position dates it geologically to near the beginning of the Quaternary Period, well over a million years old. The wall is composed of red sandstone blocks constructed in three courses, cemented together with dark red clay mixed with salt, and in numerous places is plastered over with red, slate and yellow clays. Along one stretch of wall, near the northern end a distance of 16 feet, a number of the sandstone block surfaces were covered with the hieroglyphs of a lost language. The letters were arranged in wavy, parallel and diagonal lines, interspersed with small pictures of strange animals, many unidentifiable. There were other symbols, of the sun and crescent moon, which appear to have some astronomical significance. All together, 872 individual characters were discovered. \n \n 1896 From the American Anthropologist, 1896 comes the finding of a perfect human imprint in stone near Parkersburg, on the West Virginia side of the Ohio River. The track was 14 1/2 inches long, and was found embedded in stone dated at 150 million years old. \n \n 1897 The April 2,1897 edition of the Daily News of Omaha, Nebraska, carried an article titled \"Carved Stone Buried in a Mine,\" which described an object from a mine near Webster City, Iowa. The article stated: \"While mining coal today in the Lehigh coal mine, at a depth of 130 feet, one of the miners came upon a piece of rock which puzzles him and he was unable to account for its presence at the bottom of the coal mine. The stone is of a dark grey color and about two feet long, one foot wide and four inches in thickness. Over the surface of the stone, which is very hard, lines are drawn at angles forming perfect diamonds. The center of each diamond is a fairly good face of an old man having a peculiar indentation in the forehead that appears in each of the pictures, all of them being remarkably alike. Of the faces, all but two are looking to the right. Was this stone carved and left behind by a traveler from earth's future?\n ",

   "Thanks for pointing out why you're worth absolutely nothing to talk to. If something refutes your argument, you simply pretend it doesn't exist or call it wrong based on the beliefs on the alleged authors (which you can't prove). Good job on failing to actually refute what they said. \n \n And here are two excepts from links you didn't read:\n \n \nCarl Baugh's hammer: This hammer was supposedly dug out of Ordovician strata. In fact, it is a 19th century miner's hammer of recent American historical style.\n \n Carl Baugh is something of an embarrassment even to creationists in that he is continually finding things in the Paluxy River area which just ain't so! Perhaps you've heard of \"Glen Rose Man\" which was created from a fish's tooth! That was one of Baugh's productions. As for the hammer, which was actually found by others near London, Texas in the 1930s, supposedly in an Ordovician stone concretion, it merely came into Baugh's possession.\n \n The stone concretion is real, and it looks impressive to someone unfamiliar with geological processes. How could a modern artifact be stuck in Ordovician rock? The answer is that the concretion itself is not Ordovician. Minerals in solution can harden around an intrusive object dropped in a crack or simply left on the ground if the source rock (in this case, reportedly Ordovician) is chemically soluble. This is analogous to stalactites incorporating recent objects in their paths as they grow. The rapidity with which concretions and similar types of stone can form is evident in soil caliche development. \"Rapid formation of limestone has been shown in coral atolls in the Pacific where World War II artifacts have been found in the matrix\" (McKusick and Shinn, 1980).\n\n \n \n \n\n An iron and wooden hammer, sometimes called the \"London Artifact\" or \"London Hammer,\" found by local hikers in a creek bed near London, Texas in 1936, has been promoted by Carl Baugh and other strict creationists as an out-of place artifact. They maintain that the hammer, which was partially embedded in a small, limy rock concretion, originated in a Cretaceous rock formation (or an Ordovician or Silurian one, depending on the account), thus contradicting the standard geologic timetable. However, the hammer was not documented in situ, and has not been reliably associated with any specific host formation. Other relatively recent implements have been found encased in by similar nodules, and can form within centuries or even decades under proper conditions (Stromberg, 2004). The hammer in question was probably dropped or discarded by a local miner or craftsman within the last few hundred years, after which dissolved limy sediment hardened into a nodule around it. Although a brief rebuttal to Baugh's hammer claims was made by Cole (1985), Baugh and a few other creationists continue to promote it. This review provides further analysis of the hammer and creationist claims about it.\n",

   "Here's hundreds of more out of place artifacts. Take your pick tearing them apart. You just prove that for every piece of evidence to document the flaws in evolutionary claims, that evolution sites will try to denounce them. I'm not impressed though and stand by my evidence.\n \n And speaking of imbedded anomalies, here's an interesting link that has to make you go hmmmm, at the very least. I realize that few if any of these can be verified, but they are interesting none the less. I posted discoveries up to the 20th century.\n \n http://www.bibleufo.com/articleembedded.htmEmbedded Anomalies\n Evidence of Civilization Before the Accepted Creation Timeline\n By\n Patrick Cooke\n \n From ancient geological strata comes what have been labeled OOPARTS, or Out Of Place Artifacts. These are what appear to be recently produced items and imprints found in natural mineral formations millions of years old. Conservative historians and archaeologists, who hold to the concept of linear cultural development, point to the ancient Middle East as the home of the very first metal production. Here, they claim, man began to melt and shape copper, iron, gold, and silver only 8,000 years ago. \n \n 1572 From the Archives of Madrid a letter dated 1572, comes the account of the Spanish Viceroy in Peru and a strange artifact, which came into his possession. A perfect six-inch nail was later presented to the Viceroy as a souvenir, who had it thoroughly examined, and verified it was found in rock dated to 75,000 to 100,000 years in age.\n \n 1820 From The American Journal of Science and Arts, 1820 comes the account of an ancient tool discovery. At a quarry near Aixen-Provence, France, in 1788, 40 or 50 feet below ground in a layer of limestone were found coins, petrified wooden handles of hammers, pieces of other petrified wooden tools, and a quarrymen's board. The limestone was 300 million years old.\n \n 1822 The American Journal of Science from 1822, north of Pittsburgh an unusually flat rectangular surface, 3 feet long and varying from 5 to 6 inches wide was found. On this flat surface were row after row of evenly spaced, perfect diamond shapes, each with an oblique, raised band across its center. The pattern is too precise to be natural, the diamond shapes too square to be designed by anything but an intelligent hand. In fragments of the impressed rock, were found fossils of primitive jointed plants, dating the find to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago.\n \n 1822 The American Journal of Science, 1822 reported a number of man track impressions on an outcrop of grayish-blue crinoidal limestone along the west bank of the Mississippi for 3 miles just south of St. Louis. The foot lengths were 10 1/2 inches wide.\n \n 1826 In a well dug near the Ohio River in north Cincinnati at a level 94 feet down, a buried tree stump was found which showed the marks of an ax. The marks were deep and well cut, indicating the use of a sharp and durable blade. The ax used was confirmed to have been made of metal when, embedded in the top of the stump, an advanced oxidized wedge of iron was found. The layer in which the stump was found was dated to be between 50,000 and 75,000 years old nearly 10 times the accepted age of the supposed first metal usage.\n \n 1829 From the American Journal of Science, an account sent by a correspondent, to Prof. Silliman, of something that was found in a block of marble, taken November 1829, from a quarry, near Philadelphia. The block was cut into slabs. By this process, it is said, was exposed an indentation in the stone, about one and a half inches by five-eighths of an inch. A geometric indentation: in it were two definite-looking raised letters, like 'I U': only difference is that the corners of the 'U' are not rounded, but are right angles. We are told that this block of stone came from a depth of seventy or eighty feet---or that, if acceptable, this lettering was done long ago.\n \n 1844 On June 22, 1844, this curious report appeared in the London Times: \"A few days ago, as some workmen were employed in quarrying a rock close to the Tweed about a quarter of a mile below Rutherford-mill, a gold thread was discovered embedded in the stone at a depth of eight feet.\" Dr. A. W. Medd of the British Geological Survey wrote in 1985 that this stone is of Early Carboniferous age between 320 and 360 million years old. Who dropped this gold thread in the ancient fern forests in a distant time when the most advanced life forms on the planet where amphibians and insects?\n \n 1845 From a communication by Sir David Brewster, 1845, a nail had been found in a block of stone from Kingoodie Quarry, North Britain. The block in which the nail was found was nine inches thick. The quarry had been worked about twenty years. It consisted of alternate layers of hard stone and a substance called 'till,' The point of the nail, quite eaten with rust, projected into some 'till,' upon the surface of the block of stone. The rest of the nail lay upon the surface of the stone to within an inch of the head---that inch of it was embedded in the stone. \n \n 1851 In the June 1851 issue of Scientific American, a report was reprinted from the Boston Transcript about a metallic vase dynamited out of solid rock in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The bell-shaped vase was 4 1/2 inches high, 6 1/2 inches at the base, 2 1/2 inches at the top and an eighth of an inch thick. The metal of the vase was composed of an alloy of zinc and a considerable portion of silver. On the sides were six figures of a flower in bouquet arrangements, inlaid with pure silver, and around the lower part a vine, or wreath, also inlaid with silver. The chasing, carving, and inlaying are exquisitely done by the art of some unknown craftsman. This vase was blown out of solid pudding stone from 15 feet below the surface. The estimated age was 100,000 years.\n \n 1851 In Whiteside County, Illinois two copper artifacts, a hook, and a ring were brought up during the drilling of a well from a sand stratum 120 feet deep. The stratum was dated at 150,000 years old.\n \n 1851 The London Times, December 1851: Hiram De Witt, of Springfield, Mass. dropped a piece of auriferous quartz about the size of a man's fist. It split open and there was found inside a cut-iron nail, slightly corroded and the size of a six-penny nail. It was entirely straight and had a perfect head.'\"\n \n 1852 Scientific American, June 1852. During blasting work at Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1851, the broken halves of a bell - shaped vessel were thrown by the force of an explosion from the vessel's resting place within a bed of formerly solid rock. The vase, about 4 1/2 inches high, was made of an unknown metal and embellished with floral inlays of silver - the art of some cunning craftsman.\n \n 1853 A horned lizard was found inside a block of stone, in New Mexico, in 1853. The stone was \"so solid as to preclude the entrance of the smallest insect\". The lizard was sent to the Smithsonian Institute, where it died 2 days later.\n \n 1856 The last of the pterodactyls (flying reptiles with leathery wings and long, toothy beaks) died about 100 million years ago, according to established scientific opinion. But in the experience of a number of startled French workmen, the last one died in the winter of 1856 in a partially complete railway tunnel between the St. Dizier and Nancy lines. In the half-light of the tunnel, something monstrous stumbled toward them out of a great boulder of Jurassic limestone they had just split open. It fluttered its wings, croaked, and died at their feet. The creature, whose wingspan was 10 feet 7 inches, had four legs joined by a membrane, like a bat. What should have been feet were long talons, and the mouth was arrayed with sharp teeth. The skin was like black leather, thick and oily. At the nearby town of Gray, the creature was immediately identified by a local student of paleontology as a pterodactyl. The rock stratum in which it had been found was consistent with the period when pterodactyls lived, and the limestone boulder that had imprisoned the winged reptile for millions of years was found to contain a cavity in the form of an exact mold of the creature's body.\n \n 1857 Between 1857 and 1866 in gold mines on Table Mountain, northwest of Needles, California were found bones of extinct mastodons, mammoths, bison, tapirs, horses, rhinos, hippos, and camels, all dating from the Pliocene period. Also found among the fossils was a stone disc used for grinding, a large stone bowl, part of a human crania, a stone mortar a complete human skull. It was determined that the items were 12 million years old. \n \n 1865 A two-inch metal screw was discovered in a piece of feldspar unearthed from the Abbey Mine in Treasure City, Nevada. The screw had long ago oxidized, but its form, particularly the shape of its threads, could be clearly seen in the feldspar. The stone was calculated to be 21 million years in age.\n \n 1865 Excavating for the Hartlepool waterworks in Durham England, in 1865, workmen accidentally freed a living toad from a block of magnesian limestone 25 feet down.\n \n 1867 At the Rocky Point Mine, in Gilman, Colorado, at a depth of 400 feet excavators found human bones embedded in a silver vein and a well-tempered copper arrowhead. The vein was dated at 135 million years old. \n \n 1867 It is reported that James Parsons, and his two sons, exhumed a slate wall in a coal mine at Hammondville, Ohio, in 1868. It was a large smooth wall, disclosed when a great mass of coal fell away from it, and on its surface, carved in bold relief, were several lines of hieroglyphics. \n \n 1869 The Los Angeles News of December 17, 1869 reported a smooth slate wall covered with strange alphabetic writing had been discovered in a coalmine at a depth of 100 feet. The letters were raised and well defined. The coal that had covered the wall bore their distinct impression, which means the letters date to a time when the coal was in a vegetable state and had molded itself against the wall. Each sign was three-quarters of an inch in size, and arranged in rows precisely spaced 3 inches apart. The coal was from the Carboniferous era, well over 200 million years old.\n \n 1870 At Lawn Ridge, 20 miles north of Peoria, Illinois, in August of 1870, as a well was being drilled the pump brought up a small metal medallion to the surface. The strange coin / medallion was composed of an unidentified copper alloy, about the size and thickness of a U.S. quarter of that period. It was remarkably uniform in thickness, round, and the edges appeared to have been cut. Researcher William E. Dubois, who presented his investigation of the medallion to the American Philosophical Society, was convinced that the object had in fact passed through a rolling mill, the edges showed clear evidence of the machining. Both sides of the medallion were marked with artwork and hieroglyphs that had somehow been etched in acid, to a remarkable degree of intricacy. One side showed the figure of a woman wearing a crown or headdress; her left arm is raised as if in benediction, and her right arm holds a small child, also crowned. The woman appears to be speaking. On the opposite side is another central figure, a crouching animal wth long, pointed ears, large eyes and mouth, claw-like arms, and a long tail frayed at the very end. Below and to the left of it is another animal, which bears a strong resemblance to a horse. Around the outer edges of both sides of the coin are undecipherable glyphs - they are of very definite character, and show all the signs of a form of alphabetic writing. The stratum from which the coin was extracted was dated between 100,000 and 150,000 years.\n \n 1877 Prospectors near Eureka, Nevada found a human leg bone and kneecap sticking out of solid rock. Doctors examined the remains and determined they were from a very modern-looking human being, and one that stood over 12 feet tall. The rock in which the bones were found was dated geologically to the Jurassic Period, over 185 million years old. \n \n 1877 Prospectors near Eureka, Nevada found a human leg bone and kneecap sticking out of solid rock. Doctors examined the remains and determined they were from a very modern-looking human being, and one that stood over 12 feet tall. The rock in which the bones were found was dated geologically to the Jurassic Period, over 185 million years old. \n \n 1880 Workmen drilling a well discovered a doll-like figure sometime before 1880 near Marlboro in Stark County, Ohio. The image made of black variegated marble and standing 6 inches tall was unearthed from a depth of 120 feet. The layer in which the doll was found was dated at over 300,000 years.\n \n 1880 Near Loch Maree and Victoria Falls, Scotland, the hollow impression that would be left by double bars of iron placed closely together. was discovered. The observation was corroborated years later when micro-specks of iron oxide were taken from the impression cavities. The bands occur high above the falls in an almost totally inaccessible place, where a \"structure\" would serve little purpose. The sandstone in the impressions show tiny striations, which are really the preserved grain marks of the iron, indicated the metal had been impressed in the primordial sand, before solidification took place. The sandstone in which the bands occur is Cambrian dating to 600 million years old. \n \n 1882 Near Carson City, Nevada, a layer of sandstone was found covered with fossilized animal tracks, including those of an extinct mammoth along with several human tracks were also found. \n \n 1884 The London Times, June 22, 1884: Workmen quarrying rock, close to Tweed, about a quarter of a mile below Rutherford Mills, discovered a gold thread embedded in the stone as a depth of 8 feet.\n \n 1884 Fossilized human tracks were discovered in a rock quarry near Managua, Nicaragua, in a layer containing 16 to 24 feet below the surface, geologically dated as being over 200,000 years of age. \n \n 1885 In the fall of 1885, at an iron foundry near Bocklabruck, Upper Austria, in a piece of brown coal that had been mined from the pits at Wolfsegg, near Schwannstadt, a cube-like metal object was found. The composition is iron, carbon, and a small quantity of nickel. The coal dated to the Tertiary Period making it 60 million years old.\n \n 1885 The American Antiquarian reported a find east of the town of Berea, Kentucky. Preserved in the layer were the fossilized impressions of several creatures, including two well-preserved prints of a human being. They were described as \"good-sized, toes well spread, and very distinctly marked.\" In 1930 geologists discovered a total of twelve 9 1/2-inch human tracks and portions of others, and confirmed that they had indeed been impressed upon gray Pottsville sandstone dating from the Upper Pennsylvanian period dating them at over 300 million years old. One track had a distance from heel to heel of 18 inches, a giant by any standards.\n \n 1885 The American Antiquarian, 1885 gave the account of another find associated with the St. Louis footprints. \"A particular set of tracks was described in detail. Directly before the prints of these feet, within a few inches, is a well-impressed and deep mark, having some resemblance to a scroll, or roll of parchment, two feet long by a foot in width.\" The squared impression was not a natural shape; neither were scratch marks that would have indicated the patch had been carved. Rather, the evidence points to the parchment impression having been made when the rock was still in a plastic state, made at the same time as the footprints. What such a find suggests is that the prints' owners were not only men, but were men with the intelligence to produce some form of paper sheet - and perhaps write upon it. The limestone, in which prints and paper appear, is dated to the Mississippian age dated 345 million years ago.\n \n 1885 A well driller discovered a little clay doll that had come from below a 15-foot layer of lava rock, 100 feet of sand, 6 inches of clay, 40 feet of more sand, then 165 feet composed of clay, sand, clay nodules mixed with sand, and coarse sand layers for a total of 320 feet. The small \"doll\" is composed of half clay and half quartz, and though badly battered by time, the doll's appearance is still distinct. It had a bulbous head, with barely discernible mouth and eyes; broad shoulders; short, thick arms, and long legs, the right leg broken off. There are also faint geometric markings on the figure, which represent either clothing patterns or jewelry. The doll is the image of a person of a high civilization, artistically attired. The layer in which the doll was found was dated at over 300,000 years.\n \n 1891 The June 11th Morrisonville Times reported: \"A curious find was brought to light by Mrs. S. W. Culp last Tuesday morning. As she was breaking a lump of coal preparatory to putting it in the scuttle, she discovered, as the lump fell apart, embedded in a circular shape a small gold chain about ten inches in length of antique and quaint workmanship.\n \n 1891 Near Cleveland, Tennessee a length of wall was discovered which was traced for a thousand feet, on the average 2 feet thick and 8 feet high, with numerous projections spaced along the top every 25 to 30 feet. The wall ran roughly at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees east. The structure continues on beyond the section exposed, in both directions, following the crest of a ridge that extends from the Hiawassee River north of Chattanooga southward, where it dips beneath the Tennessee river. Its position dates it geologically to near the beginning of the Quaternary Period, well over a million years old. The wall is composed of red sandstone blocks constructed in three courses, cemented together with dark red clay mixed with salt, and in numerous places is plastered over with red, slate and yellow clays. Along one stretch of wall, near the northern end a distance of 16 feet, a number of the sandstone block surfaces were covered with the hieroglyphs of a lost language. The letters were arranged in wavy, parallel and diagonal lines, interspersed with small pictures of strange animals, many unidentifiable. There were other symbols, of the sun and crescent moon, which appear to have some astronomical significance. All together, 872 individual characters were discovered. \n \n 1896 From the American Anthropologist, 1896 comes the finding of a perfect human imprint in stone near Parkersburg, on the West Virginia side of the Ohio River. The track was 14 1/2 inches long, and was found embedded in stone dated at 150 million years old. \n \n 1897 The April 2,1897 edition of the Daily News of Omaha, Nebraska, carried an article titled \"Carved Stone Buried in a Mine,\" which described an object from a mine near Webster City, Iowa. The article stated: \"While mining coal today in the Lehigh coal mine, at a depth of 130 feet, one of the miners came upon a piece of rock which puzzles him and he was unable to account for its presence at the bottom of the coal mine. The stone is of a dark grey color and about two feet long, one foot wide and four inches in thickness. Over the surface of the stone, which is very hard, lines are drawn at angles forming perfect diamonds. The center of each diamond is a fairly good face of an old man having a peculiar indentation in the forehead that appears in each of the pictures, all of them being remarkably alike. Of the faces, all but two are looking to the right. Was this stone carved and left behind by a traveler from earth's future?\n ",

   "I realize that reasonable deductions are beyond you slick, but consider this for a second. There are two schools of thought regarding the origins of life that we debate, and they are Evolution and Creation. If I post evidence that directly refutes the claims made by evolution, and shows that their assumptions are in effect poppycock, like, for example finding a hammer that could only be thousands of years old found imbedded in rock considered to be from the cretaceous age, then that is pretty good evidence in favor of the Creation account and against evolution.\n\n Ladies and gentlemen, what has just been demonstrated by our forum illogicizer is an example of the false dilemma fallacy. Had this been a real dilemma, Archie wouldn't look like such an idiot.\n \n \nSo your bible has spoken and that settles it?\n\n So Baugh had the hammer dated? Baugh is more credible than talkorigins despite the Paluxy River track shenanigans? Two plus two is seven? If Baugh is making the claim that the hammer is encased in ancient rock, then Baugh is the one who has to produce the evidence. And since Baugh is known to be a fraudulent hack, he'd better have some damn good evidence instead of what he has now, which is none.",

Did you follow his debate with Peeling? Archie would raise a point, Peeling would address it. Archie would then ignore that point and raise a different one, which Peeling would address. Archie then ignored that response, raised a slew of new points, Peeling only covered a few, and Archie accused Peeling of ignoring points.\n \n Archie will keep raising new points and ignoring the defeat of his previous points for as long as you let him get away with it. That's why I've been hammering at him to present evidence for creation and ignoring everything else that's he's thrown up as a diversion. The only chance you have of getting anything like a real debate out of him is to get him to make 1 (one) ONE point, and then stick to that point like glue until it's resolved. Give him any wiggle room and he'll slide off onto a completely different subject, ignoring the fact that you raised valid points about the subject that he pretended to be able to defend.",
