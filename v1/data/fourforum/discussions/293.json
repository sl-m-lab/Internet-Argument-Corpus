For instance, if you rob a bank you get 10 years, if you do it with a gun you get 10 years added to your sentence.

   "As to how you'd know if they did it knowingly or not, it should be easy enough to have a nation-wide campaign to educate the public as to who cannot own a gun legally: Felons and minors. (Minors CAN own guns legally, but they have to act through their parent/guardian.) That isn't hard to remember. It also shouldn't be hard to remember if the person you are buying the gun for is a felon. Presumably, you know this person rather well for them to ask you to do this. \n \n As Kelvin says, those who's guilt is NOT unquestionable MUST go free. That's supposed to be the law of the land. Yeah, there'll probably be several guilty persons who escape punishment, but that is a small price to pay for keeping our right to bear arms un-infringed.\n \n About project Exile... if this is the same Project Exile that just passed 358 to 60 in the House, I don't think it was a good idea. I'll post in a different thread on that subject. \n \n But all this is a little off the subject... should we have conceled carry laws at all? Because if everything is done right, they are basically unenforceable, cause we do not want police officers randomly stopping people on the street to search for illegally conceled weapons. \n \n Kelvin, you don't hear about that AR-15 (D.C. \"sniper\" rifle) being sold under the table in the mainstream media, now do you? :D",

Kelvin's idea would work to a point, but not totally. My father-in-law use to sell guns illegally on the streets back in the day, no one really knew he was doing it because the criminals that were buying the guns from him werent going to tell, and neither where the suppliers to him. \n \n I think though, that most people that carry concealed weapons on a daily basis, either legally or illegally, are not the criminals. they are the ones trying to protect themselvs. the ones that just want to live a normal life and to feel safe.

   "I myself am not against training, I have been shooting all of my life, went to hunter education and got alot more training with firearms than I bargained for in Basic Training, yes they are extremely strict at Basic, we had people that had never even seen a gun before. The first rounds we actually got to handle (to practice how to load the weapons) were all clearly marked duds with plastic heads; which is good, a man that was in my cycle somehow succeded in loading the round backwards into the chamber, he ended up shooting expert though before we got through (along with 49% of my company, we set the Fort Knox record for the most first time experts in pistol qualification ever at Fort Knox). Training is a good idea, what is not a good idea is charging $500 for it. I would say that $100 should do it just fine, after all you would be supplying the firearms and ammo yourself. But I still do not think it is right to make training mandatory if you are going to charge them for it. The taxes paid by the person buying the weapon and the taxes they pay on the cost of ammo should be more than enough to cover it, but that would fall under gov't waste, not concealed carry.",
