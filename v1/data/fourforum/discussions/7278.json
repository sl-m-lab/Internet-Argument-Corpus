   "This is maybe the most ignorant comment I have ever heard you make....and that is saying a LOT.\n \n Reagan stood up to Gorbechev? By the time Gorbachev came along, the soviet union was failing and there was no way anybody could have stopped it. Carters policy of using the afghan war to bankrupt the soviets worked well. Reagan was there to spend trillions unnecessarily on defense and to take credit for the work of better men. The soviet union had failed. They were bankrupt (mostly for running their economy the same way Reagan did, and Bush is, running ours). They couldn't feed their people. \n \n As far as the next elections, with the GOP's numbers, the democrats could run nothing but monkeys and take congress.\nThey certainly have a large pool of monkeys to choose from...and they tried the monkey trick last time...it didn't work.\n \n \n \n If the dems had sense enough to nominate Joe Leiberman, we might have a Democrat President today...but, NOOOOOOOOO!\n \n It used to amaze me how people could continue to downplay the effect that Ronald Reagan had on world power. He did much more than Chicken Little Carter in causing the downfall of the Soviet Union. History experts from both sides of the aisle know this. It's just too convenient an argument for the Carter fans to pass up...so they disguise the truth with Carter's only contribution to the cause.\n \n In regard to Alito's first day...he certainly surprised Joe Biden!emoticon_xgood \n \n The Democrats will oppose ANYONE nominated by a Republican President. Alito is showing them that he's not easily trapped by leading questions.",
