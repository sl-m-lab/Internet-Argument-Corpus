   "The title is admittedly engaging, but it was by design. Because I believe people cannot argue logically while submitting supernatural arguments, I will offer a proposal. When discussing the development of a fetus, please use \"consciousness\" or \"sentient\" and not \"soul.\" The soul seems to be a religious/spiritual construct which adds no weight to a discussion about abortion. By allowing discussion of a soul, one has no way of proving or disproving something and it opens the door for other faith-based statements.\n \n \n And, yes, I will offer my soul for sale. The bid will start at $1000 and I can accept payment through paypal. In return, I will send through certified mail a statement that you are the new owner of my soul. I will have this notarized as well.\n The price may seem steep, but it is my soul we're talking about. With it, one could conceivably die twice, or maybe give it to someone as a gift. If there are criminals reading this, my soul is good as I haven't committed any crimes against another person (well, after the age of 16). You may be able to use this soul for whatever afterlife projections your religion dictates.\n To boost the incentive, I will put a time limit on this sale, so hurry up!",
