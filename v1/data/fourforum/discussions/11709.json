I just let him go and called the police with his plate number, and just in case you are curious, his car weighs about 4000 lbs, my loaded mixer weighed about 76000 lbs, so obviously he would have been at a big disadvantage if I had decided to use his car for a playtoy.

   "Some prior gun bans we have had in America:\n \n 1. The sham \"registration and secure storage\" scheme imposed upon the citizens of Boston by General Gage:\n \n \n \"The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind....\n The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th. of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to '[D]eclare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial.\" Quotes from the Continental Congress' Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms [July 6, 1775, authored by Thomas Jefferson] beginning at p. 286 in Sources Of Our Liberties, American Bar Foundation, Richard L. Perry, editor, revised edition (William S. Hein & Co. 1990)\n \n The next three were enacted to support racist agendas...\n \n 2. The denial of a RKBA to black slaves in the South, and a denial of the RKBA to them as newly freed citizens. Post civil-war examples:\n \n [concerning the State of Kentucky] \"the civil law prohibits the colored man from bearing arms. . .their arms are taken from them by the civil authorities. . . .Thus, the right of the people to keep and bear arms as provided in the Constitution is infringed. . .\" Executive Document #30, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, pp. 233 and 236 (1866) [from the Report of the Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau]. [bold emphasis added]\n \n [from Mississippi's \"Act to Regulate the Relation of Master and Apprentice Relative to Freedmen, Free Negroes, and Mulattoes.\"] \"That no freedman, free negro or mulatto. . .not licensed to do so by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie knife. . .\" Laws of Mississippi, 1865, p. 165 (November 29, 1865).\n \n 3. The disarmament and concentration-camp style internment of American citizens of Japanese ancestry during WWII.\n \n 4. The denial of the right of Native Americans to own any meaningful class of firearms, an insidious practice which was not ended until 1979. \n \n ---\n \n Editor Loyal Georgian: Have colored persons a right to own and carry firearms?--A Colored Citizen\n Almost every day we are asked questions similar to the above. We answer certainly you have the same right to own and carry arms that other citizens have. You are not only free but citizens of the United States and as such entitled to the same privileges granted to other citizens by the Constitution. . . .\n Article II, of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States, gives the people the right to bear arms, and states that this right shall not be infringed. Any person, white or black, may be disarmed if convicted of making an improper or dangerous use of weapons, but no military or civil officer has the right or authority to disarm any class of people, thereby placing them at the mercy of others. All men, without distinction of color, have the right to keep and bear arms to defend their homes, families or themselves.\n From issues of the Loyal Georgian, January 20, 27 and February 3, 1866.",
