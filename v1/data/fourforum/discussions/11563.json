We see a fly and swat it. We see a rat and set a dog on it. We see a cockroach and stamp on it. Pests. No problem. But when elephants trample villages, or other warm-blooded mammals become pests, there's an outcry about the destruction method.

It seems that cuddly, warm-blooded, embryo look-alikes get more emotional feeling than flies, cockroaches, mosquitos et al.\n \n From a strictly 'argument' point of view, emotion shouldn't enter the picture.

How could God have a pre-existence relationship with us if we didn't receive our soul until the third trimester? Eph 1:4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,\n So God chose us who were destined to respond to the love of Christ, before the foundation of the World, yet we don't have souls until the third trimester?

As of 2002, the Kaiser Family Foundation publication that I mentioned earlier reported that Alaska was in a category of states requiring only that abstinence be \"stressed,\" but not necessarily to the exclusion of so-called \"comprehensive\" sex education. On the other hand, Alaska also did not require contraception information in sex ed classes at that time. (PDF here.)\n \n Of course, just because Alaska is not receiving federal Title V funding does not mean the state is not practicing abstinence-only sex education, but I can't prove it one way or the other on line. Alaska curriculum standards (available as a PDF here) contain nothing more specific than the requirement that students \"understand the physical and behavioral characteristics of human sexual development and maturity\" and \"understand the ongoing life changes throughout the life span and healthful responses to these changes.\" (As a side note that everyone should keep in mind when we talk about curriculum standards, it is often a stretch to assume that there is any connection between what the bureaucrats dream up and what teachers actually do behind their closed classroom doors, although one might reasonably assume that, the more potentially controversial a subject, the more likely most teachers would be to follow district policy.)",

You talk out of both sides of your mouth and then try and twist my words to suit your Marxist agenda. \n \n I PREFER women to see a pregnancy through to birth. I feel exceptions should be made in the case of rape/incest where a woman is forced to have sex against her will, or where the mother's life is medically in danger. In such cases, the CHOICE of doing what she wants with her body was taken away from her. Therefore, the only hypothetical case where a woman is FORCED BY THE GOVERNMENT to not have control over her own body would be if an abortion was prevented under those circumstances. In all others, the woman CHOSE to have unprotected sex and should bear the consequences of that CHOICE. Our positions differ because of the point in time which we recognize \"choice\" as taking place. \n \n I do not think getting an illegal abortion should be punishable with jail time as you keep trying to insist I do, but that a hefty fine to both the doctor and woman would serve as a deterrent.

   "Babe,\n \n For the record, here's the entirety of your post #75 on the \"Have you seen an abortion performed\" thread:\n \n That's right, you can't force a person to carry a baby to term, whether abortion is legal or illegal. Obviously people don't give a darn about many of the laws in this country and do as they damn please anyway.\n \n However, there are repercussions, depending on which choice a pregnant woman makes. If she chooses to murder a defenseless, voiceless baby, is she claiming self-defense? Or is she pleading temporary insanity at the time of conception?\n \n I think the decision should be made under conditions where our government makes it easier to get pre-natal care and place babies into the adoption system with less red tape. I think the choice to give life and carry it to term, regardless of how that life came to be (with the exception of rape victims) should become the preferred choice, because it is the right thing to do. Not because God says so, not because pro-lifers say so, but because we all need to be responsible for our actions.\n \n Please note that you make no qualification for rape and incest victims.\n \n In fact you make a point of saying it's your preferred choice \"regardless of how that life came to be\".\n \n Well, guess what, it's my preferred choice as well.\n \n But it is a choice, not the only choice, and by saying that, you clearly believe that, although they may not be your PREFERRED choice, other choices should exist. \n \n Now, please stop accusing others of twisting your words; they speak quite eloquently for themselves.\n \n Now, will any of you profetallifers please tell us why you think the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is.",

This alternative to contraception is especially appealing to women who have any one of innumerable reasons for desiring pregnancy but not reproduction. It is also appealing to perceptive women in appropriate circumstances who note that it is cheaper to have a welfare-supported abortion than it is to personally purchase contraception. This substitute is also being embraced by certain women and couples who consider themselves to have a minimal risk of pregnancy because of infrequent or erratic coitus or because of known or suspected low fertility. It has also been used by hostile feminists who harbor the belief that 'Abortion is my right. Why should I use contraception if I don't want to'. The availability of abortion is also largely the basis for the pretentious rejection of contraception by an apparently growing body of young non-conforming social dissenters who declare, Why sweat? So it happens. So we'll take care of it.' It seems certain that for some time to come there will be an increasing number of women who will reject contraception purely on the basis of the availability of legal abortion.\"3\n",

My mother-in-law always said she was happiest and felt the best when she was pregnant - and she had 11 children. If a woman willingly engages in unprotected sex and gets pregnant, then she must BEAR the consequences - 40 week gestation period. After the baby is born, she has a new choice to make, be a mother to the child or give it up for adoption. We've already established there are tens of thousands of couples wanting to adopt. \n\n \n Get this through YOUR head, sweetie.\n \n We are very glad about how your mother-in-law felt.\n \n However, your grandmother is not the paradigm for all women.\n \n Now tell us why you feel the woman MUST bear the child iif she feels differently from her if not as punishment.\n \n BTW, you're still sidestepping the question of why you feel that the government is the better determinant of the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. \n \n Would you have wanted the government to tell your prolific mother-in-law that she MUST abort?\n \n After all, that's the logical consequence of the government telling a different woman that she must NOT abort.\n \n Doesn't giving the government that much power make your skin crawl?

The substantive component of the Due Process Clause was correctly applied to this concept.\n\n No, because even if privacy is fundamental within the meaning of substantive due process (a proposition I would dispute), extending that to encompass abortion is not plausible because abortion cannot possibly be thought to be a component of the kind of privacy that is deeply rooted in this nation's tradition and history. How do we know?

As defined (or, rather, undefined) by SCOTUS, it cannot be said to have been so rooted. Abortion simply cannot be shown to be a part of the kind of privacy so deeply rooted in our nation's history and tradition such that it could be deemed to be protected by the Constitution.\n Substantive due process purports to objectively identify and protect those rights that are deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition. Really it is just a sham that allows the Supreme Court to wax philosophical instead of legal, and tell us lowly citizens what the law ought to be, rather than what it actually is.",

   "No, because even if privacy is fundamental within the meaning of substantive due process (a proposition I would dispute), extending that to encompass abortion is not plausible because abortion cannot possibly be thought to be a component of the kind of privacy that is deeply rooted in this nation's tradition and history. How do we know? Because abortion was restricted in virtually every state from the early 1800s until 1973.\n\n \n \"Kind of privacy\"? I'm not certain what you mean. Several aspects of personal life have been consistently part of privacy and have been protected by SCOTUS.\n \n For example: Loving v. Virginia. If not found within the Fourteenth Amendment's liberty clause and the implicit right to privacy, where would the basis for the decision be found that the State could not infringe upon a person's right to marry another of a different race? And since Loving, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the &#8220;personal rights&#8221; recognized in the case are protected by the right to privacy. In Carey v. Population Services (involving the right to contraception) and Zablocki v. Redhail (involving the right to marry), the Supreme Court held: While the outer limits of this aspect of privacy have not been marked by the Court, it is clear that among the decisions that an individual may make without unjustified government interference are personal decisions relating to marriage, Loving v. Virginia; procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson; contraception, Eisenstadt v. Baird; family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts [and] Meyer v. Nebraska. \n \n Procreation, conception, marriage, family life. All of these reasonably and rationally relate to the decision whether or not to terminate your pregnancy. It absolutely flows naturally with other protected areas of private life. \n \n Just looking at the two cases of Griswold v. Connecticut and Eisenstadt v. Baird, right to contraception cases, whether or not you have a child is a personal and private decision constitutionally protected from governmental interference. In Eisenstadt v. Baird, the Court extended the marital right to privacy in Griswold to unmarried individuals and explained that: if the right to privacy means anything, it is the right of an individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\n \n All of these necessarily include the freedom to decide whether or not to terminate the pregnancy.",

That's it I really don't give a hoot anymore. Our government should mind its own business and let people float or sink on their own. I don't see why it even interferes as much as it did. Our taxes shouldn't be wasted trying to support someone else's decision. Something personal that belonged to only them. They should dig that money out of their own pocket and deal with their business. \n \n This whole pro-life and pro-choice argument wouldn't even matter if the gov't realised that. \n \n I suppose a fetus isn't a human being then? I suppose for the first year of your life you weren't a human being just something else. Something freakishly inane and strange. A non-being if you will. You were a parasite that was most likely willing placed into your host.

It is the means we would necessarily have to use to save that life that is immoral to some (myself included).

Why is the government a better determinate of how fast I drive, how much I drink, or who I kill. Governments are by nature designed to limit our personal freedoms and use violence, if necessary, to enforce it. It's all part of how we get along.

   "The counter is that the law is not in the business of making metaphysical distinctions.\n \n Agreed: No one can prove or disprove a metaphysical belief, hence the term meta (beyond) physics (the observable). Any government would be ill advised to base laws on metaphysical perceptions.\n \n There are many in this country who believe there is a new person from the moment of conception. Others would place \"personhood\" at some point in fetal development. There are still others who say that personhood = birth.\n \n I personally put \"personhood\" as having held a job for at least 3 years. ;)\n \n All are sincerely held but ultimately unprovable assertions.\n \n In light of this, I say that it ill behooves any government to favor one metaphysical construct over another; it must maintain strict neutrality and leave the decision to the one person capable of making a choice about her particular pregnancy - the woman herself.\n \n I have based my argument on biological distinction, which for me puts the line at conception. If one were to try and argue where life begins or when a fetus is viable, then the metaphysical paradox kicks in. I counter this by stating that at conception life does not begin anywhere, but that life continues from a living egg and living sperm joining to create a unique and separate being. \n \n With that being said; we as a society need to resolve some fairly massive sociological problems first. A major shift in perception (how we view the problem) and action (what we are willing to do about it) must occur. Unfortunately, we are also sorely lacking in wisdom. Unwanted pregnancies are going to happen. What are alternate ways to deal with it. How do we minimize the cost in both lives and emotions. Until this is resolved, a change in laws will cause more harm than good and prove unsuccessful. My goal is probably the same as most people here. I would love to see abortions end because they are no longer needed.\n \n Thank your response Chester, I think in some areas we agree on more than we disagree.",

Weird huh? And it happens millions of times per year all over the world in every culture, religious group and creed. Some might even call the process of human pro-creation a scientific FACT due to its regularity and the literal BILLIONS of times the experiment has been successfully repeated and personally observed by virtually everybody who has ever lived. \n \n You see chester, that is why the dung you spew is such an incredibly pathetic testimony of the shallowness and lies that you so proudly represent in every post you write about abortions. Because you must attempt to justify the murder of the only innocent party in that process of legalized infanticide. \n \n And then you have the nerve to accentuate your utter shallowness by placing this at the top of each post: Choice - an all-American family value! As if the right to kill our unborn children was not only decreed to us by the founders, but it's a positive family value like baseball and apple pie. \n \n You deny that life starts at conception yet you can't refute that once that egg and seed germinate and become fertilized, it then grows into a sentient being. If life didn't exist in that egg at conception, it would never grow into a thinking human being with hopes and dreams and potential just as you allegedly had before you lost your soul and decided that it required a breath of air before one deserved to be called a human being. \n \n What is so incredibly shallow about the pro-abortionist is that you yourselves, like all of us went through the same exact gestational process that we all went through in order to be typing on these keyboards. Yet how easily you support denying the innocent unborn their rights to life when they are perfectly healthy and in no way threatening their mothers lives either. You support a woman's right to choose to use abortion as a method of birth control.

Yes, laws prohibiting stealing limits the liberty of one person while protecting the liberty of another. In the end it is a wash.\n \n Slavery is so abhorrent not only just because of the loss of freedom, but the dominion over another person in pervasive and complete ways. Basic decisions such as: who I have babies with, do I have a baby now, do I give blood, am I an organ donor, do I eat now or later, what do I eat, when do I sleep and other decisions that seem more fundamentally personal are decided by an outside agency. This strips more than freedom away, it strips dignity and, in some sense, humanity away.\n \n This is where the comparison comes from. Perhaps it is wrong to draw a similarity between the complexity that was slavery to this more simple issue, but I think that the horror that many women view the necessarily draconian measures that would have to be put in place to effectively administer a complete moratorium on abortion to be similar in many important respects to slavery.\n \n \nAs for taking away the ability to give birth by thier own choice.

The most consequential question comes before that: why would it matter if it is a human being--the \"so what?\" of the question.\n \n It is a massive assumption to hold that all human beings have rights. That is at least as hard to prove as proving that the fetus is a human being, and it is more consequential since the question would apply not only to the fetus, but to all human beings. \n \n \nA fetus is a group of dividing cells\n\n So am I.

This is not potential human life. This is human life.\n \n What we have prior to conception is a sperm or egg. These are not developing human beings. They have no more potential in themselves to develop into, say, an infant than asphalt does. If left in their natural environment, neither the sperm nor the egg will ever enter this process of development.\n \n I simply cannot see how one can say there is no difference in these two entities.

   "As I have been trying to point out, whether the fetus is a human being is not the consequential assumption/fact here. The most consequential question comes before that: why would it matter if it is a human being--the \"so what?\" of the question.\n\n \n Well, if it wasn't a human being it would not have the same rights as a real human being.\n \n \nSo am I. So are you.\n\n \n Fair enough, but we are a mentally existent bunch of dividing cells. We are not just an empty body. A fetus would be more comparable to a severed body part, or a brain dead person.\n \n \n \nI don't know why this is the line. Mental existence, in practical terms, is totally meaningless to, say, a one day old infant. What do you understand \"mental existence\" to be, and why do you think it is the threshold one must attain in order to have rights? And, while you're at it, what do you mean by \"rights?\"\n\n \n Well, if mental existence isn't the basis of rights, then what is? If something does not mentally exist, then why should they deserve rights? They cannot be harmed or pleased, they don't give a care what happens around them. They are non mentally existent. Should a blade of grass have rights?\n \n \n \nNo. What we have from the moment of conception is a biologically distinct, developing being that is human. If left in its natural environment, this little cell will develop, not into a human being, but into a particular kind of human being: a fetus; then infant; then adolescent; then teen; and then adult. This is not potential human life. This is human life.\n\n \n I won't argue that it is human life. There are all kinds of human life, just like you, me, my kidney, and my skin cells. However a mere set of proteins is not the basis of rights, it is mental existence. I think most would agree. You do grasp this concept, right?\n \n \n \nWhat we have prior to conception is a sperm or egg. These are not developing human beings. They have no more potential in themselves to develop into, say, an infant than asphalt does. If left in their natural environment, neither the sperm nor the egg will ever enter this process of development.\n\n \n I agree with this, however if left in its natural environment a tumor will also develop. Just because something may be natural is not grounds for allowing it to grow at the cost of someone else.\n \n \nI simply cannot see how one can say there is no difference in these two entities. The difference is abundantly clear. I realize there could be genuine questions of whether the embryo has moral value; but I do not think there can be any serious discussion about whether the embryo is manifestly different from an egg or sperm.\n\n \n Of course the embryo is different, however a mere difference is not the basis for any rights.\n \n Let me give a scenario. An alien decides to come to earth for some reason. He has a universal translator on him, and speaks our language. He looks radically different, however he can make conversation and perform everyday tasks. He is sentient, and he has feeling and can feel pain. He brings along with him a plant species from his planet. The plant is obviously not sentient, and is very much like earth plants. Which alien deserves rights, the plant or the sentient alien and why?",

   "Well, if it wasn't a human being it would not have the same rights as a real human being.\n\n But why should we think that human beings have rights in the first place? That was what I was trying to get at.\n \n \nFair enough, but we are a mentally existent bunch of dividing cells. We are not just an empty body. A fetus would be more comparable to a severed body part, or a brain dead person.\n\n Except that a severed body part will never continue along the line of development into an infant, child, adolescent, and then adult.\n \n I also maintain that if we knew, with the same level of certainty that we know a fetus will \"recover\" from its brain dead state within 9 months, that a brain dead individual would essentially make a full recovery within nine months, we would not allow him to be removed from life support.\n \n \nWell, if mental existence isn't the basis of rights, then what is?\n\n Rights exist by virtue of what something is, not by virtue of what it possesses. Being a human being is the criteria for possessing human rights. You say one cannot be a human being without mental existence. I'm still not sure what you mean by this. Nor am I clear about what you mean by the word \"rights.\"\n \n I will call attention to the brain dead example. I will suppose that a brain dead individual would not possess a mental existence within your meaning. If we knew that he would recover within 9 months, I would say he has the right not to be unplugged from the machine that would be sustaining his life in the interim. It would be immoral for us to do so if there were such a substantial certainty that he would make a full recovery by leaving him alone for a few months.\n \n \nIf something does not mentally exist, then why should they deserve rights?\n\n Human beings do not possess rights because they deserve them. They possess rights simply because they are human beings. We don't give human beings their rights; we recognize rights that they already possess.\n \n \nThey cannot be harmed or pleased, they don't give a care what happens around them.\n\n And you think a one day old infant can be harmed and pleased? That they care what happens around them?\n \n We could administer anesthesia to an infant such that he be aware of neither harm nor pleasure. And an infant clearly has no care for what goes on around him. He has no self-awareness at all.\n \n \nThey are non mentally existent. Should a blade of grass have rights?\n\n You are asking the wrong question. The question is not whether something should have rights. The question is whether something does have rights. I don't sit in my castle and think about who I think I will give rights to; I possess no such power, and neither does any other person or government institution. Rights holding things possess those rights independent of you, me, or government.\n \n \nHowever a mere set of proteins is not the basis of rights, it is mental existence. I think most would agree. You do grasp this concept, right?\n\n It's hard to grasp when I don't know exactly what you mean by either \"mental existence\" or \"rights.\" You've used the term mental existence a lot, but I am not clear on exactly what you mean by it, or why you think it is a morally significant quality.\n \n I am equally unclear of what you mean by \"rights,\" because you have asked the question \"should X have rights?\" That question is nonsensical based on my understanding of what a human right is. So, if you could explain these terms more concretely, it might help me understand your view a little better. In my reply to you, I've had to make some assumptions about your terms that may not be true.\n \n \nI agree with this, however if left in its natural environment a tumor will also develop.\n\n That is not what I said. I did not say that, left in its natural environment, the fetus will develop. No, what I said is that, left in its natural environment, the fetus, a human being at one stage of development, will continue developing into more advanced stages. It will not develop into a human being because it already is that. It simply will enter into a more advanced stage, ultimately resulting in an infant, adolescent, teenager, then adult.\n \n This obviously cannot be said about a tumor. Can you really not see the difference? When was the last time that a tumor popped out, and starting crying? When was the last time that a tumor popped out and continued its development independently, eventually developing into a child, adolescent, teenager, and adult? There is no comparison.\n \n \nJust because something may be natural is not grounds for allowing it to grow at the cost of someone else.\n\n This is not the argument I made. I was purely using the nature argument to demonstrate that a fetus is clearly different from an egg or sperm. And since you seem not to have understood that, I've used the nature argument again to demonstrate that the fetus is, in itself, compellingly different than a severed body part or a tumor.\n \n \nLet me give a scenario.

I know you've probably read it before as a historical document. But try to read it as a philosophical document. It is undisputed that it articulates the historical foundation of the concept of human rights, and I think it powerfully does so. I'd be interested to see what you think of this.

This is more of a question for him.\n\n Well, that makes it pretty hard to argue against the point. Maybe consider my example of the brain dead patient who will recover. That might help you and I understand what \"mental existence\" means, and more importantly, why it is morally significant.\n \n \nWhat do you mean by this?\n\n I was merely asking you what a \"human right\" is. That was all. The reason that I asked is that you have said some things that suggest that you believe human rights are divisible from human beings; that is, they do not possess their rights inherently. I got this idea from the fact that you have asked \"who should have rights?\" and \"does such-and-such deserve rights?\"\n \n \nI am only concerned about the stage in which it is at a certain point in time. Not what it could be, should be, or would be.\n\n To be clear, I am not saying that a fetus will develop into a human being.\n \n That being said, I was using the nature argument to demonstrate one thing, and only one thing: that a human embryo is quite clearly separate and distinct from either a tumor, skin cell, severed body part, etc. Therefore, trying to morally equivocate the embryo with a tumor on the basis that they are the same is not a valid inference.\n \n Let me phrase it this way: it indeed might be true that the embryo has no more moral value than a tumor. But if that is the case, it is not because the embryo is inherently the same as a tumor. It would have to be for some other compelling reason.\n \n \nThese things are all different, however the principle is the same. Should something in a given point that lacks a mental existence have the rights to override a woman's right to her own body?\n\n Is that really the question? I would suggest it is not. Many people have argued that even if the fetus had a right to live, its right to live still wouldn't override a woman's right to her own body.\n \n \nIn a debate, religion must not be used as an argument for those who don't believe, or for political discussions.\n\n I do not adhere to such dogmatic statements dismissing out-of-hand the validity of claims which appeal to a Creator.

   "Modern rights theory is not only very important to understanding what rights are, but it is also very fascinating.

If you were looking for something more detailed, I would suggest John Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government.\n \n The short of it is that rights theory originated with the existence of rights being grounded in a Creator.\n\n Partly jumping into this discussion: There were many theories about rights circulating at the time of the founding of this country. The Declaration of Independence, though it states that rights are \"endowed by their creator\", was never meant to be a document outlining the legal functioning of the new government. It was simply meant as a document doing exactly what its title suggests - declaring independence from Britain. Indeed, I find it very telling that the main section on rights in the Constitution (which IS the document outlining the functioning of our government) should include freedom of religion as its first right and that it was the very writer of the Declaration of Independence that supported and coined the term \"Separation of Church and State\".\n \nThis is a bit off the scope of our subject. You may want to be careful with how you handle this hypothetical. If it would be immoral to remove the life support from a person who is brain dead in the scenario I gave (that is, in the event we would expect him to recover fully), then his rights are not a function of his mental existence.\n\n If I understand the scenario correctly, then your hypothetical would have him mentally exist before and mentally exist after, but not while he was on life support. So, unplugging him while he was brain dead but on life support would not infringe on the rights of a mentally existing person since he would not be currently mentally existing.\n \n Either way, nobody elses rights get trampled upon while he is on life-support so there is no compelling need to unplug him (unless there is no financial way to support that, etc.) - a situation far different from pregnancy.\n \n \nYou said earlier that you are not sure what the basis of our rights is. If you read the Declaration of Independence, you will know the historical answer to that question.\n\n Once again, it is not the Declaration of Independence that is the source of our rights but the Constitution. The Declaration of Independence was approved by the early Congress only as a document declaring independence from Britain. The debate about how to structure rights came later and, again, was supporting a separation of church and state by the very man who wrote the Declaration of Independence.\n \n From http://www.usconstitution.net/jeffwall.html:\n \nThomas Jefferson was a man of deep religious conviction - his conviction was that religion was a very personal matter, one which the government had no business getting involved in. He was vilified by his political opponents for his role in the passage of the 1786 Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom and for his criticism of such biblical truths as the Great Flood and the theological age of the Earth. As president, he discontinued the practice started by his predecessors George Washington and John Adams of proclaiming days of fasting and thanksgiving. He was a staunch believer in the separation of church and state.\n \n Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to answer a letter from them written in October 1801. A copy of the Danbury letter is available here. The Danbury Baptists were a religious minority in Connecticut, and they complained that in their state, the religious liberties they enjoyed were not seen as immutable rights, but as privileges granted by the legislature - as \"favors granted.\" Jefferson's reply did not address their concerns about problems with state establishment of religion - only of establishment on the national level. The letter contains the phrase \"wall of separation between church and state,\" which led to the short-hand for the Establishment Clause that we use today: \"Separation of church and state.\"\n\n \n One other point to make is that, during the time of the founding of the US and for most of American history until the late 19th century, the only laws governing abortion were the inherited British common law which legally allowed for abortion if it happened before \"quickening\". This shows that, from a historical perspective, any discussion among the founders and pioneering Americans about rights (to life or otherwise) did not pertain to pre-quickening fetuses.",

In fact, Abraham Lincoln argued on the basis of the Declaration of Independence that blacks were equal with whites and endowed with the same unalienable rights.\n\n People were not in common agreement on which rights are \"unalienable\" - which was a major problem with the theories about natural rights. Namely, it was hard to establish an objective criteria to decide on them. Any actual rights that were brought into law were therefore not decided upon because a particular religious belief dictated them but because the founders, Jefferson in particular (who wrote the Bill of RIghts) thought them through and the Congress accepted them. The founders were very highly influenced by the Enlightment so, though many were themselves religious (though often in the abstract belief of the deists), it is clear that Enlightment thought played a very large role.\n \nYes. But my question is, would it be wrong to unplug him. I think yes.\n\n A main part of my moral philosophy (and that of many or even most others) is to treat others as we would expect to be treated if we were in their situation. From that point of view, if I knew that I was heading into a brain-dead coma (something that does not exist but I will follow your hypothetical), then I would want to be kept alive long enough to recover. Thus, I would support his body being kept alive until he could recover. This assumes, though, that there exist no compelling reasons to disconnect him which oppose my reasons for keeping him connected. The life-support system is just a machine, so we need not worry about that. However, it does require large amounts of money to support a body on life support. If only a small number of bodies were kept alive that way, then our society could probably support that, but if tens of millions of bodies would need to be supported that way, then our society just would not be able to cope and one might have to start unplugging for financial reasons. Either way, we luckily don't have to make such decisions in reality.\n \nThe Declaration of Independence articulates the philosophical justification for rights and the purpose of government. Reading the Declaration of Independence in tandem with the Constitution, we can avoid contradiction only by saying that the source of our rights is the Creator, and it is the duty of government to recognize and protect those rights, which we have done through the mechanism of a Constitution.\n \n I'm not saying the Declaration of Independence has any legal authority. What I am saying is that the Declaration of Independence lays out the principles which were put into practice via the Constitution.\n\n Yet any path that the founders took from the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution is far less clear. Can you give quotations from the Federalist papers or from Jefferson (who wrote the Bill of Rights) outlining the thought process which you suggest? Namely, do you have any way of showing that it was indeed religiously inspired natural rights which drove the decision on which rights were included in the Constitution? That would be telling and would be the only thing I could imagine that would support your claim.\n \n Lastly, in my previous post, I added a last paragraph on edit which I am not sure that you caught in time. I will repeat it here since I am curious about your reaction:\n \nOne other point to make is that, during the time of the founding of the US and for most of American history until the late 19th century, the only laws governing abortion were the inherited British common law which legally allowed for abortion if it happened before \"quickening\".

My whole argument is that rights exist whether or not they are formally recognized and protected. This is why I can say that even when slavery was legal it was nevertheless wrong.\n \n 2) In that historical time, quickening very likely was the first evidence that conclusively demonstrated that life was present. If that is true, then it would appear that these common law rules were crafted to protect life from the moment they knew it to be present.\n \n 3) Scientifically speaking, little very little was known regarding the embryology at the times you mentioned.

   "The core issue here is where do we draw the line on what qualifies one as a \"human being\". History is full of sorry examples, and I will not go into them. Laws have been written and repealed, all based on overall popular perceptions and religious beliefs. My argument has been based in biological distinctiveness. I can state for a fact, that a new born has the same biological distinctiveness at birth as when it was conceived. The same DNA coding. You can, in-fact, take a recently conceived embryo out of one mother and transfer it to another mother. The biological distinction remains, and you don't even have to use anti-rejection medication. I have also stated that the distinction occurs at conception, it doesn't start as \"body part\" and it does not develop over so many weeks. So why do we draw the line at X number of weeks?\n \n I have heard many arguments on the rights of the mother, and the limiting effect the abortion laws have. In spirit, in an ideal world, I whole heartedly agree with you on the pro-choice side. I am very much a civil libertarian. The only justifiable reason to curtail the rights of person is when they curtail or eliminate the rights of another. I have heard many arguments on the burden an unwanted pregnancy places on the mother, both financial and emotional and I empathize. I also heard this little voice in the back of my head. It's an old Joe Stalin quote from the 40's; \"A single death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic\", and lately, I have been thinking like a statistician.\n \n We draw lines based on empathy. There is a lot of wisdom in old Joe's quote. If it is happening to someone close, a single death is a tragedy. If is common place, happening outside of sight, to strangers, it's a statistic. A new born is cute, cuddly and scores high on empathy points. A fetus, in the early stages of development, is unseen, except by surgical means and scores low on empathy points, yet it is the same being, the same biological entity. We draw lines based on empathy.\n \n I have a unque and interesting personal perspective on this issue. I was born in 1956, when the line was drawn on date night, somewhere around 3rd base. The argument was about condoms at that time. A decade later, it was towards the end of the 2nd trimester. I was also born under one of the worst possible circumstances, to one of the worst possible mothers, and served the next 5 to 6 years as one of those unwanted children. Had it been a decade later, I am certain I wouldn't be writing this post, because anyone with any sense would have gotten her to a clinic. The core question for me is; Do I have the right to exist?",

   "Chester,\n I think you may have misinterpreted my meaning in the last paragraph. The reference to the year 1956 is the year I was born, and does not carry any desire to put on a pair of penny loafers and turn back the hand of time, or shall I say progress. It is just my personal time line. I also now realize that decade maybe a hot button to people on both sides of the issue and will refrain from referring to it. All I was trying to say, is that under my particular circumstances, with today's laws, my little blob of cells, er.. my moms little blob of cells wouldn't be around very long, and we wouldn't be having this conversation. That is why I give empathy points toward my, ugh, moms little blob of cells.\n \n As to your last question, here's where we left off;\n \n Chester\n Jay, \n \n Those of us who believe in choice have no problem whatsoever with the choice you make here.\n \n If so you and yours believe, then so you and yours must act according to your inner light.\n \n What we object to is the concept that one size fits all.

   "Modern rights theory is not only very important to understanding what rights are, but it is also very fascinating. If you were interested in a very brief overview, I would suggest the Declaration of Independence. If you were looking for something more detailed, I would suggest John Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government.\n\n \n I have read the Declaration of Independence, and I understand what rights are. However, rights are moot if there's no one to enjoy then.\n \n \n \nThe short of it is that rights theory originated with the existence of rights being grounded in a Creator.\n\n \n One must consider that no everyone believes in a \"creator\"\n \n One must also consider the first amendment: freedom of religion.\n \n \n \n1) Again, the example of development demonstrates nothing more than the fact that an embryo is clearly different from a tumor or severed body part. It is not meant to show anything more than that simple fact.\n\n \n I am not denying that it is different, however in principle its the same. All three are groups living human cells that lack a mental existence. I am not concerned with what it may become, because under the right conditions a sperm may become a human being too. I am only concerned with what it is at a given period.\n \n \n2) I have said nothing about women as life support machines\n\n \n Except of course when you compared women to life support machines in your last post.\n \n \nThe brain dead example I gave was meant to suggest nothing more than the fact that a brain dead individual in the scenario I gave would (where we would have reason to believe he would fully recover) have rights, but no mental existence.\n\n \n A brain dead individual is legally dead, and has no rights.\n \n \n \nAnimals do not have rights; in some instances they have legal protections. But so do some plants and land. Do not confuse legal protections with moral rights.\n\n \n You can have whatever opinion you want on \"moral rights\", however it is undeniable that animals have legal rights. You can word it however you want, however it will not change the simple fact that you cannot do whatever you want to an animal.\n \n \n \nThis is a bit off the scope of our subject. You may want to be careful with how you handle this hypothetical. If it would be immoral to remove the life support from a person who is brain dead in the scenario I gave (that is, in the event we would expect him to recover fully), then his rights are not a function of his mental existence.\n\n \n A) It is not immoral to remove a brain dead person from life support.\n \n B) It is not off topic, and you still haven't answered my question. Would it be morally right to kidnap someone and hook them up to a dying person for 18 years?\n \n \n \nWell, at least it seems I've been clear in what I've said, which is a relief because when talking about theory, its easy to lose folks.\n \n The answer I would give to this question is that our Creator has endowed human beings with rights, and has not so endowed cats, ferns, etc.\n\n \n Again, you cannot assume that everyone in this country shares your religious belief.\n \n \n \nI would encourage you to sit down for a few minutes and really read through the Declaration of Independence. I know you've probably read it before as a historical document. But try to read it as a philosophical document. It is undisputed that it articulates the historical foundation of the concept of human rights, and I think it powerfully does so. I'd be interested to see what you think of this. You said earlier that you are not sure what the basis of our rights is. If you read the Declaration of Independence, you will know the historical answer to that question.\n\n \n I do not take every historical document as literally as you do (the bible, the constitution, etc.) especially when its over hundreds of years old. The fundamental question remains, why have rights when there is no one to enjoy them?\n \n \n \n \nWell, that makes it pretty hard to argue against the point. Maybe consider my example of the brain dead patient who will recover. That might help you and I understand what \"mental existence\" means, and more importantly, why it is morally significant.\n\n \n You make a good point, however a brain dead person that may recover is not physically and emotionally harming anyone.\n \n \n \nI was merely asking you what a \"human right\" is. That was all. The reason that I asked is that you have said some things that suggest that you believe human rights are divisible from human beings; that is, they do not possess their rights inherently. I got this idea from the fact that you have asked \"who should have rights?\" and \"does such-and-such deserve rights?\"\n\n \n Here's a new question: What makes us humans better than other living organisms?\n \n \n \nTo be clear, I am not saying that a fetus will develop into a human being.\n \n That being said, I was using the nature argument to demonstrate one thing, and only one thing: that a human embryo is quite clearly separate and distinct from either a tumor, skin cell, severed body part, etc. Therefore, trying to morally equivocate the embryo with a tumor on the basis that they are the same is not a valid inference.\n \n Let me phrase it this way: it indeed might be true that the embryo has no more moral value than a tumor. But if that is the case, it is not because the embryo is inherently the same as a tumor. It would have to be for some other compelling reason.\n\n \n The only more \"moral value\" an embryo has to a tumor is that it may have a mental existence. Physically you're right, they are different, however \"spiritually\" they are equivalent when you factor out the potential of an embryo.\n \n \n \nIs that really the question? I would suggest it is not. Many people have argued that even if the fetus had a right to live, its right to live still wouldn't override a woman's right to her own body.\n\n \n I agree with that.\n \n \n \nI do not adhere to such dogmatic statements dismissing out-of-hand the validity of claims which appeal to a Creator. Neither would the framer's of the Declaration of Independence, which, as I have said, articulates (both historically and logically) the foundation of human rights.\n\n \n You can call my statement whatever you want, however I still stick to it. It would be equally ridiculous if I said \"I am right because the fairies say so, end of discussion\". Unless I can prove the existence of these fairies, the point is moot. The same applies to a creator.\n \n I do hold the Declaration of independence with weight, however it does not mean I adhere literally to every statement it makes. As I have stated above, it would be foolish to employ the use of the \"creator\" argument, because no one can know for sure if this \"creator\" exists. We must stick to what we already know.",

   "I'm new to this forum and may have missed it, but I haven't seen anyone talking about the reasons we as a society can't afford to outlaw abortion either financially or morally at this point. \n \n Pro-choice advocates like to point out that there is a waiting list for adoption. There is a long waiting list for adoption, but only for healthy white babies. The waiting list for a baby with dark skin, eyes and hair is much shorter. There is no waiting list at all for babies with fetal alcohol syndrome, drug dependancies etc. If a woman does not want her child and would prefer to have an abortion, we can force her to carry it to term or have an illegal abortion, but how will we force her to stop drinking, smoking and using drugs?\n If we try to make doctors turn women in for harming their fetus, we will have women getting no prenatal care and having even sicker babies that no one wants. \n \n Teenage girls can get an abortion and have no one know she was pregnant, but once she's forced to carry the baby to term, there is social pressure that will be brought to bear to keep the baby. Most teenage girls who get pregnant are not going to have the economic and emotional support that Gov Palin's daughter will get from her family. I'm sure her and her husband to be will still go to college, will have a decent place to live, and will have good childcare for their baby. That is not an option for many if not the majority of girls in the same situation. Most of these girls will end up dropping out of school and becoming dependant on our failing social welfare system. \n \n We can force women/girls to have the baby, but we can not force them to be good, dedicated and attentive mothers. We already have plenty of examples of what bad, inattentive, abusive parents can do to a child and we would be legislating that we put more children in that situation. \n \n The economic costs of outlawing abortion would also be huge. The majority of abortions are not being chosen by married, financially stable women. We will have to shoulder the costs of prenatal care, childbirth, foodstamps, housing assistance, and unfortantely incarceration in our prisons for many of the children we will force mothers to bring into the world. The same people who want to outlaw abortion also commonly rail against welfare mothers and high taxes. We will get more of both if this ever goes through. \n \n Finally, this is a religious question because I only know the answer for my own religion. If a baby miscarries, what happens to that babies soul? We don't believe that the baby is sentenced to eternity in hell. We believe that it returns to heaven and is given another chance at life. If that is the case, why would a loving God punish the soul of an innocent and not give the soul of a baby whose mother chose abortion the same chance at life? \n \n Thanks\n Kim",

   "Hi Kimara, welcome to the forum. An interesting first post. I will deal with these points as they are fresh opinions here.\n \n \nWe can force women/girls to have the baby, but we can not force them to be good, dedicated and attentive mothers. We already have plenty of examples of what bad, inattentive, abusive parents can do to a child and we would be legislating that we put more children in that situation.\n\n \n It seems like you're saying that killing the healthy unborn child is preferable to holding irresponsible women culpable for their abusive and inattentive behavior. Since when do we make excuses for the criminal and even kill the victim in anticipation of their bad behavior? Don't you see how backward that type of thinking is? \n \n \n The economic costs of outlawing abortion would also be huge. The majority of abortions are not being chosen by married, financially stable women. We will have to shoulder the costs of prenatal care, childbirth, foodstamps, housing assistance, and unfortantely incarceration in our prisons for many of the children we will force mothers to bring into the world. The same people who want to outlaw abortion also commonly rail against welfare mothers and high taxes. We will get more of both if this ever goes through. \n\n \n I'm not sure if you're aware of this but the abortion industry is a multi BILLION dollar annual industry. That means that the American people are spending that much for this type of birth control, which in literally 94% or so of cases, that is all abortions represent. And that is irresponsible women avoiding the need to take responsibility for their irresponsible actions.\n \n \nFinally, this is a religious question because I only know the answer for my own religion. If a baby miscarries, what happens to that babies soul? We don't believe that the baby is sentenced to eternity in hell. We believe that it returns to heaven and is given another chance at life. If that is the case, why would a loving God punish the soul of an innocent and not give the soul of a baby whose mother chose abortion the same chance at life? \n \n\n \n As a Born Again Believer, I can assure you it is more than a religious question for us. It is a quality of life issue, and a value of life issue. And in no way do I believe that when an unborn child is murdered in the womb that God sends him to hell. I can't imagine where you got such an idea. But neither do I believe that God has a revolving door in Heaven where aborted babies are recycled like we recycle plastic or paper. \n \n The bible very clearly say's that we have one life, and then the judgement. Of course aborted babies, like children who die before reaching the age of accountability aren't judged at all. So that isn't an issue for them. But they have still been deprived of the life that God intended for them, and He will hold the responsible parent(s) accountable for stealing that life from her own child. \n \n This is life and death of human beings we are talking about here kimara. It's not about economics, convenience or just personal responsibility. It's about valuing what is precious and vital to our humanity. It is our very offspring, our progeny. We valued that continuation of ourselves at one time. But this generation has become so selfish that we prefer to destroy our offspring with the excuse that if you make us bear it we will abuse it and raise criminals so better that we kill it in the womb while it is perfectly innocent and without any blemish or the stain of human sin. Can you grasp how utterly contemptible such an attitude is? From posts here, I fear most can't grasp that truth anymore. emoticon_confused emoticon_cry I'm not yelling at you kimara, I'm just venting. As i said, welcome to the forum, don't let my diatribe drive you away. emoticon_xangel",

   "Your last two paragraphs say it all IMNSHO.\n \n If we permit the government to ban abortion today; we grant that government the right to require them tomorrow.\n \n As we both agree, there the government goes at its, and our, peril.\n \n THANK YOU!!\n\n \n Your Welcome,\n \n As stated above, the realist in me rejects anarchy and does allow government to make rules on the big issues, like the taking of human lives. We agree philosophically, but disagree on a practical level. The protection of human life is the most fundamental human rights and trumps my libertarian outlook.\n \n I think we both agree that government has no business in defining what or who is human. This is defined by nature, biology. I have heard no counter argument to my assertion that a unique human being is formed at conception, as defined by their unique DNA coding, so I guess we are in agreement. As stated in my original post #311 \"... that Zef is a separate, unique human being and therefore, Zef's human rights should be preserved.\"\n \n So in direct response to your question; Why is the government a better determinant of the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is?\"\n Because that is what a good government does, only intercede on the big issues and guarantee basic human rights.",

   "That's all the distinction that is needed; it's physically independent.\n\n \n But it is anything but physically independent of its Mother, and you refuse to face that. It is totally and completely dependent upon it's mother for years to come or else it will die.

So it remains physically attached to its mother for between 1 and 3 more years after birth. The poorer the Country, the longer the reliance to the breast.

   "Another opinion", 
   "I do not think that appealing to a Deity is necessarily inconsistent with anything you've said here. The founders obviously made this appeal, and a good deal many enlightenment thinkers did as well. John Locke, for instance.\n\n There is a big difference between appealing to a Deity for wisdom and guidance vs introducing governing principles based on a particular religious belief. \n \nI don't want to assume anything, so let me ask this simply for clarification.\n \n Would it be wrong to disconnect him. Suppose for the sake of argument that there is not monetary or availability concerns for keeping him alive. I.e., assume there are no other compelling reasons to disconnect him. Would it then be wrong to do so even though he has no mental existence?\n\n If there is no compelling reason to disconnect him, then I agree that it would be wrong to disconnect him - though not as wrong as disconnecting a currently mentally existing person. \n \n However, to clarify a point, then I will make the comparison that something similar can be said about killing born people. Namely, if there is no compelling reason to kill someone, then it is wrong to kill them. However, we all know that there exist compelling reasons to kill born people - in war, for self defense in extreme situations, etc.\n \n The main issue then lies in what one would consider a compelling reason to do something that is morally negative and, to determine that, one needs to determine how \"bad\" that morally negative act is. I would say that it is morally worse to kill a mentally existing born person than it is to kill this hypothetical temporarily non-mentally existing person, and that it is morally worse to kill the temporarily non-mentally existing person than to kill the pre mentally existing embryo/early fetus. The reason for this last point is that the temporarily non-mentally existing person HAD mentally existed and, from the moral reciprocity rule, I would have wanted to be kept alive if I were in his shoes. Up to the present time, the embryo/early fetus NEVER mentally existed, so one cannot apply a reciprocity rule to a being that only exists in the imagination. \n \n Anyway, my point is to say that the compelling arguements that are sufficient to justify killing any sort of being depend on the level of \"badness\" of killing. So, following that logic, there need to be fewer compelling reasons to kill an embryo/early fetus than to kill the temporarily non-mentally existing person. And there need to be fewer compelling reasons to kill the temporarily non-mentally existing person than there need to be to kill a mentally-existing born person.\n \n \"Goodness\" and \"Badness\" are not on a binary scale. They form a continuum. Otherwise, stealing an orange would be viewed as equally bad as killing a person.\n \nI don't disagree with this. But let me offer a few thoughts.\n \n 1) It would not matter whether they recognized the fetus' right to life. My whole argument is that rights exist whether or not they are formally recognized and protected. This is why I can say that even when slavery was legal it was nevertheless wrong.\n\n I agree that slavery was wrong. However, the southerners clearly didn't. So, one wouldn't have been able to convince them by simply stating that freedom is a natural right for everyone - including slaves. One would need to have stated reasons to counter their views justifying slavery. \n \n Again, though the arguements of natural rights were emotionally compelling and probably drove the rhethoric behind the Declaration of Independence, it is a lot harder to define rights granted by a government when your governing Congress is not agreed upon the point of which rights are unalienable. That is why the granting of rights needs to be based on reason. Indeed, I would propose that out rights in the Constitution were determined for us mainly by a combination of reason and, unfortunately, politics (ex. where southern states were appeased by not granting slaves freedoms). \n \n2) In that historical time, quickening very likely was the first evidence that conclusively demonstrated that life was present. If that is true, then it would appear that these common law rules were crafted to protect life from the moment they knew it to be present.\n\n Women experienced morning sickness far before quickening and they would lose their period as soon as they were pregnant, so there were many physical signs to point to the start of a pregnancy prior to quickening. My understanding is that, for much of Christian history prior to the 19th century, the soul was not considered to enter the body prior to quickening. This may have been a large influence. However, I admit that I have not looked into the details of the reasoning that determined this British common law.\n \n3) Scientifically speaking, little very little was known regarding the embryology at the times you mentioned. What I find particularly interesting is the fact that as the body of scientific knowledge increased, the laws became more prohibitive of abortion and more protective of the unborn life.\n\n Except during recent decades, where science has revealed increasingly more about the human mind in relation to the functioning of the human brain. So, any thought of a mental existence would have transfered from purely religious arguements about soul to scientific arguements about brain development.",

By default it would have to reverse Roe V Wade and return this issue to back to the people and the States where it belongs. \n\n That could well be true. However, by the same standard of laws not being able to rule on abortion due to inability to rule on personhood, the states would also not be able to rule on abortion. \n \n Either way, this point is moot for any arguements I have ever made about abortion since, unlike you and Chester, I personally think that the government should be able to rule on personhood, but that such deliberations should be based on rational reasoning, not on religious dogma (as per \"Separation of Church and State\").\n \n \nAnd since you piped in on this, maybe you can respond to the valid arguments that chester will only ignore and run away from as he rigidly sticks to the party line talking points. \n\n Since I am not Chester and there are various issues regarding abortion rights on which Chester and I disagree, I will not be addressing all of your arguements to Chester. However, there are a few points which I am willing to address:\n \nAnd isn't it interesting that medical technology regarding the treatment of the unborn is an integral and vital field in medicine, LIKE SAMUEL HERE: If these unborn are not people, why care about their protection and preservation in the womb? \n\n My arguement is that, for pre-mentally existing fetuses (mainly prior to third trimtester), the efforts made are mainly for the sake of the mother of a wanted fetus, who has staked a lot of emotional investment in that early fetus. For late term fetuses where mental existence might already be present, I would say that it is both for the sake of the mother and for the sake of the fetus itself (who can now suffer abnormalities or medical problems) that one makes the medical effort.\n \n As for the point about the embryo being human, I agree that it has human DNA and is a unique life form and will grow into one of us which, by one definition of the term \"human\" matches. However, many people use the term \"human\" interchangably with the term \"person\" and, here, I would disagree that an early fetus is a person. Mainly, my argument is that a person is not only a human body, but one where there is \"somebody home\" - i.e. some level of mind or mental existence. I don't call mere bodies people, nor do I afford rights to mere bodies. Again, as I have pointed out to you in various threads, what WILL BE is not the same thing as what IS. The fetus WILL BE a person someday, in all senses of that word, but that doesn't mean that it CURRENTLY is a person until, in my view, it gains that critical component - a mental existence.",

I deny it. In some instances, animals have legal protections, which are not the same things as rights.\n\n \n Yes, they are the same.

But at least we need not pretend that this debate hinges on whether the fetus is a person in possession of the right to live.\n\n \n You're right, this debate is not just about the fetus.\n \n \n \nYou are applying one epistemological standard when it comes to the existence of a Creator, and another standard when it comes to the existence of anything else. Philosophically speaking, it is impossible to prove the existence of anything to the degree of certainty you seem to be demanding of a Creator.\n \n For example, you say mental existence is somehow morally significant. But, you in fact could not appeal to any moral principle to justify that claim that you could prove exists.\n\n \n Indirect observation can be used also, (the existence of the atom).

And that term, as I use it, means simply: membership in the human family.\n \n \nYou are correct that the existence of rights cannot be proven, but they are damn good to have. Why give them up if they are only doing good in the world?\n\n The point is that you have a completely different standard when evaluating claims regarding religion than you do any other type of claim. That is very inconsistent.\n \n What makes you think they are doing any good? Do you only mean by that phrase that you, personally, happen to like them? What happens if some other civilization views them as good, but only if they can annihilate an entire race of people in gas chambers? What could you possibly appeal to? Morality is out; these propositions can't be proved. Rights are out; they don't exist. Where do we go from there?

On what basis could we claim that, regardless of what Southern slave owners believed about blacks, they were wrong?\n \n \nUnless this is a joke, why doesn't mental existence matter?\n\n I am trying to show you that there are a lot of assumptions that seem to be built into your mental existence argument. I am trying to get at those assumptions to show you that some of them would present the exact same problem that you have with Creator-based arguments.\n \n So, what I was getting at is what makes mental existence morally significant? The answer to that is unprovable. You said that laws based on unprovable claims would be foolish; and yet you are arguing that laws should be based on this unprovable claim.\n \n \nDoes a headless body kept alive on life support have the same rights as someone who's arm was cut off?\n\n I submit that the difference in these two scenarios has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that one person has a head, and the other does not. Suppose we knew with a great deal of certainty that the headless body on life support would fully recover within a couple of weeks if he remained on the life support. I would say that it would be wrong to disconnect him, and that he has the exact same rights as the person whose arm was cut off, but otherwise is completely fine.\n \n In real life, these brain-dead scenarios involve individuals who will not recover. Society has therefore come to the conclusion that disconnecting the life support is acceptable. However, I think it is pretty clear that if some advance in science came up with a cure for brain-deadness, and brain-dead folks started fully recovering, society would come to a completely different conclusion.",

Universally accepted morals however (illegality of murder, theft) should be ok to legislate.\n \n \n \nThese kind of questions are difficult to answer in the general abstract as you have posed them.\n \n The answer is, if I reasonably believed that deadly force was necessary to repel your attack, then I am legally justified in using the deadly force. If I could not reasonably believe that deadly force was necessary, and yet I use it anyway, that would not be legally justified.\n\n \n And so relating this to a fetus, is there any other way to prevent it from inflicting harm on you (besides drugs, obviously)?\n \n \n \nI would suggest that it is people who deny the existence of rights, but then pretend like they really do exist, who are living in a fantasy world.\n\n \n I don't deny their existence, I just deny that somehow any group of cells with a certain type of protein sequence has more rights than a different group of dividing cells with a different protein sequence.\n \n \n \nAre you sure about that? Can you really tell with any kind of certainty the exact moment when a fetus goes from having no mental existence to actually having it?\n\n \n Science can prove that. I believe that scientists have put mental development at around 21 weeks.\n \n \n \nThe fact that we are human beings. And that term, as I use it, means simply: membership in the human family.\n\n \n Human, maybe. Being? No. A being implies an existence.\n \n \n \nThe point is that you have a completely different standard when evaluating claims regarding religion than you do any other type of claim. That is very inconsistent.\n\n \n You may have misread my post. I said that the existence of rights could not be proven.\n \n \nWhat makes you think they are doing any good? Do you only mean by that phrase that you, personally, happen to like them? What happens if some other civilization views them as good, but only if they can annihilate an entire race of people in gas chambers? What could you possibly appeal to? Morality is out; these propositions can't be proved. Rights are out; they don't exist. Where do we go from there? On what basis could we claim that, regardless of what the Nazi's believed about the Jews, they were wrong? On what basis could we claim that, regardless of what Southern slave owners believed about blacks, they were wrong?\n\n \n Why is what the nazis did wrong? Because those people did not wish to be gassed. Why is murder wrong? Because people don't wish to be murdered. If people don't want unnecessary harm caused to them, then they have the right to not. I believe in rights as something anything with a mental existence has, no matter what kind of DNA is in its cells. Whether it be human, elephant, or even Kling-On. If it has a mental existence, it should have legal protections from harm.\n \n \n \nI am trying to show you that there are a lot of assumptions that seem to be built into your mental existence argument. I am trying to get at those assumptions to show you that some of them would present the exact same problem that you have with Creator-based arguments.\n\n \n I have already told you that something that cannot be proven should not be legislated. I cannot prove that humans have rights, however they contribute to the happiness and functionality of a society. What more do you want?\n \n \nSo, what I was getting at is what makes mental existence morally significant? The answer to that is unprovable. You said that laws based on unprovable claims would be foolish; and yet you are arguing that laws should be based on this unprovable claim.\n\n \n I am asking that laws be based on common sense, not an unprovable claim. I would think that mental existence being the basis for rights should seem quite obvious. Have you read my last analogy?\n \n \n \nI submit that the difference in these two scenarios has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that one person has a head, and the other does not. Suppose we knew with a great deal of certainty that the headless body on life support would fully recover within a couple of weeks if he remained on the life support. I would say that it would be wrong to disconnect him, and that he has the exact same rights as the person whose arm was cut off, but otherwise is completely fine.\n\n \n Ok, what if the headless body would fully recover? It could obviously not move, and not grow another head. It would be just a group of living cells and nothing more. Does it still have rights? I say no.\n \n \nIn real life, these brain-dead scenarios involve individuals who will not recover. Society has therefore come to the conclusion that disconnecting the life support is acceptable. However, I think it is pretty clear that if some advance in science came up with a cure for brain-deadness, and brain-dead folks started fully recovering, society would come to a completely different conclusion.\n\n \n I agree, but that's just because they will recover. Does a permanently brain dead individual have rights?\n \n It is a living human, however the only difference between it and regular human is a mental existence. What I was getting at is that you can lose any part of your body and still retain your rights, however this is not true of the head: the center of the mental existence.",

   "A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:\n \n THE PRO-ABORTION AGENDA OF JUSTIFICATION THROUGH DEHUMANIZATION\n \n To those people who are attempting to rationally debate the issue of ABORTION with these pro-death secular humanists and atheists, it is very important that you understand their true agenda and modus operandi for justifying the procedure which murders unborn babies while still in their mothers wombs.\n \n The method for justification requires that they dehumanize the unborn children which is why they will refer to them as ZEFs and Zygotes. And is why they will use comparisons to the fertilized and unfertilized chicken egg, which we eat for breakfast. You see, either way, when debating this issue on such a simplistic level, they win by default because they have already lowered the standard of debate to that of a chicken egg.\n \n So, by just understanding the shallowness of their tactics, we win by not allowing them to dehumanize our human offspring to the status of an inhuman analogy. Remember that these people are attempting to justify the murder of our very own human offspring. And they know that as well as you and I do. What they must do is both justify their stance and maintain a clear conscience so they don't have to live with the guilt that they are in fact defenders of a pro murder philosophy.\n \n That is why no matter what common sense arguments you use with them, no matter how obvious and rational your reasoning, they will never accept or concede that their position is not only false and irrational, but is criminal and a pro-death philosophy which supports and encourages genocide. After all, it is painfully obvious that any doctrine which not only allows, but enables the killing of 1.4 million members of one particular class of American consistently, year after year can be described as nothing other than genocide.\n \n That is why they must dehumanize the unborn, because they don't want to admit that they are proponents of the Great American Genocide. So forgive them for their irrational debating style which results in them offering the most infantile and ignorant arguments in their attempts to justify their sociopathic and shortsighted gospel of death and destruction of our most innocent and silent demographic, who have no personal voice of their own with which to defend themselves. \n \n What better a group to victimize than the absolute weakest among us? And they are even out of sight, so also out of mind of the masses. If they can only be dehumanized, then justifying their extermination should be easy according to the proponents of this MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INDUSTRY. So by understanding the rationale of these opponents of life for the unborn, you are more prepared to deal with the ignorance and shallowness of their inane attempts to justify such human carnage on such a massive scale. \n \n Just understand that these proponents of ABORTION are also victims since they have been raised in a selfish and self centered Society to believe that personal responsibility is a thing of the past, so demanding that the innocent child pay with its very life, the price for the sins of its mother/parents is just fine. And if they can moralize it by dehumanizing the baby so they can feel as though it is justified, then all the better. ",

And is why they will use comparisons to the fertilized and unfertilized chicken egg, which we eat for breakfast. You see, either way, when debating this issue on such a simplistic level, they win by default because they have already lowered the standard of debate to that of a chicken egg.\n \n So, by just understanding the shallowness of their tactics, we win by not allowing them to dehumanize our human offspring to the status of an inhuman analogy. Remember that these people are attempting to justify the murder of our very own human offspring. And they realize that as well as you and I do. What they must do is both justify their stance and maintain a clear conscience so they don't have to live with the guilt that they are in fact defenders of a pro murder philosophy.\n \n That is why no matter what common sense arguments you use with them, no matter how obvious and rational your reasoning, they will never accept or concede that their position is not only false and irrational, but is criminal and a pro-death philosophy which supports and encourages genocide. After all, it is painfully obvious that any doctrine which not only encourages, but enables the killing of 1.4 million members of one particular class of American consistently, year after year, can be described as nothing other than \"genocide\".\n \n That is why they must dehumanize the unborn, because they don't want to admit that they are proponents of the Great American Genocide. So forgive them for their irrational debating style which results in them offering the most infantile and ignorant arguments in their attempts to justify their sociopathic and shortsighted gospel of death and destruction of our most innocent and silent demographic, who have no personal voice of their own with which to defend themselves. \n \n What better a group to victimize than the absolute weakest among us?

Try and read it and imagine her as being your friend decades ago ;)\n \n \n \nThe patient was in a private room. I even remember the room number, 724. That was one of the gold coast rooms. The woman, in her early or mid-thirties, was married to someone really important, with a lot of connections. She came in with severe pelvic sepsis and she died. I remember her so vividly because she was one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen. She was also one of the sickest. She was ashen. When I first saw her, she was still conscious and lucid. I think she suspected she might die. She had kidney failure. Then all her other systems failed as well. She got ecchymosis-red blotches all over her skin. Her blood vessels were just breaking underneath her skin, sort of like what happens when you bruise yourself, but this was happening all over her body without anyone even touching her. It was due to a disturbance of her coagulating mechanism as a result of the overwhelming sepsis. She died two or three days after she was admitted. \n \n I remember thinking, \"My God! How could anyone do that to this beautiful woman?\" But I completely misunderstood what I was looking at. In those days the tendency was to treat the woman as the helpless victim of this monster called the abortionist. I completely missed the fact that she had obviously sought it out, and with her connections, it would have been one of the better ones that money could buy. I was so shocked by what had happened to her and the way she died that I actually was physically ill. My political ideas in those days were pretty primitive. Like most medical students, I was just trying to survive it all. However, primitive though I was, she did touch something at some level in me. \n \n I was angry that she had died, and I was angry at the system that let her die. As I said, in those days I thought the solution was to jail the abortionist. It took me another twenty years to fully understand that it was the system and not the abortionist who killed her. The system forced her away from the medical community and into the shadowy world of the illegal abortionist.  By the time she got to a doctor, it was too late. The system, and especially the lawmakers who left her with no choice, killed her just as surely as if they had held the catheter or coat hanger. I'm still angry. It was all so unnecessary. :( \n\n \n Lest We Forget... this is the real reason why we fight to support woman's rights. \n \n Pro-Choice = My body, my choice. Your body, your choice.\n \n Anti-Choice = My body, my choice. Your body, MY choice.",

This immune response is a cellular reaction that works to destroy the invading parasite.

In-fact one of the reasons why women have miscarriages is because a woman's body detects the ZEF as a parasite and her body gets rid of it. Maybe you didn't know this but many women get colds around the time of implantation. The reason why is because the immune system of a pregnant woman is suppressed while she is first becoming pregnant to help prevent embryo rejection during implantation.

Do you understand the difference between Acts like and is something? It appears that comprehension is above your pay grade.

This is medical fact. In-fact one of the reasons why women have miscarriages is because a woman's body detects the ZEF as a parasite and her body gets rid of it.\n \n IF THE MOTHER HAS AN IMMUNE DISEASE? that proves somehow that the baby is a parasite? The disease is an unnatural side affect of the pregnancy experience and is not the babies fault. So your claim is blaming the baby for some frailty in the \"mothers\" immune system which is categorized as a DISEASE.",

If you can't, then either apologize, or crawl back under the rock you came out from under.\n\n \n \nPlease stop mumbling to yourself. No one with any credibility pays much credence to your wild ramblings, but hey, why should any of the Pro-Choicers care. Like I said, you make the anti-choice movement look more and more delusional, so I guess thank you for that emoticon_xgood\n\n \n \nBlah, blah, blah... as usual, you offer nothing substantial as you lash out with your incoherent rant. If I'm so delusional ingus, and my reasoning so ignorant, then why can't a mental giant like you prove your assertion that Fetus/ZEF/Zygotes are TRUE PARASITES? You know why? Because they aren't. They are developing human beings. One of which you yourself was at one time just a few years ago. So stop lying as you make claims you can't prove. And don't you dare claim that your inability to support your irrational rants reflects badly on me. After all, I just looked at your profile. You've had 10 visits by 3 visitors, check mine out before declaring who has the most friends around HERE. Or who is respected the most.\n\n \n \nI think it's cute how archangel keeps trying to compose a post that's comprehensionable. It's like watching Salmon swimming upstream emoticon_smile\n\n \n \nReally? What is incomprehensible about these posts ingus? By alleging they are NOT comprehensible, (it isn't comprehensionable you mental midget) you simply expose that you are too ignorant to understand plain and simple english. Especially because you're unable to post the requested evidence to support your specious claims about the unborn being TRUE PARASITES. Now note the bolded, and answer the questions or stop wasting band width with your irrational and semi-literate diatribes.\n",
