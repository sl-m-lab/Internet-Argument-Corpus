   "It seems clear that most people in the Middle East are quite biased against the West, particularly the US, and often hold very skewed opinions about US intentions, culture and outlook toward Islam. My questions for discussion are: Which anti-Western views can be discredited as complete falsehoods, which are exaggerations of legitimate grievances, and which views are validly based on true grievances over unjust US or Western actions? Also, if certain grievances are not valid, how can we communicate our side of the story and be believed? \n \n Issues that come to mind include:\n 1) US support for Israel.\n 2) US support for repressive Arab regimes, as in Saudi Arabia.\n 3) The influx of Western culture into the Middle East, which is viewed by many Muslims as very morally lax, particularly where sexual morals and women's rights are concerned.\n 4) The US invasion of Iraq, which I hear is viewed mainly as an attempt to take over oil reserves.\n 5) The pervasive view that the West is out to attack Islam itself, thus justifying jihad in their minds.\n \n (Note: I am new to the \"Peace in the Middle East\" forum, so I apologize if these issues have already been discussed in this context.)",

Israel is in fact basically a tiny, desperate, outnumbered nation with no resources willingly owned and used by the US primarily as a mercenary force to perpetuate ME destabilization in those nations not accepting carte blanche US ideology and/or trade terms favorable to the US.\n \n As an agnostic member of a Jewish household, I feel Israel is a secular emotional state tied together by long-gone historical tradition/geographical occupancy and existing belief system that got a little lucky when the UN was assisting in the division of England's no longer affordable to England ME conquests.

I think that the Bush administration certainly saw WMDs as a possible legal basis. they thought they could take it to the UN and get a resolution passed which would allow for military actions. They were wrong.

   "1. violation of a ceasefire is sufficient legal pretext for resumption of war\n\n \n Not so much. First, you must prove that a violation of the cease fire occured. Keeping in mind that we never actually had the authority to set up no fly zones, nor did we have the authority to require unfettered military access to Iraq. Our planes that were \"enforcing the no fly zones\" were in reality invading Iraqs soveirgn borders. Saddam had every right to order them shot down. \n \n Besides, the next Un resolution off the line regarding Iraq essentially canhged the way we dealt with saddam and invalidated the cease fire. Even the Bush administration has stopped claiming the war in Iraq was legal. In the beginning, we argued that it was a war of pre-emption (which is only legal if you can show a clear and present threat, which we could not).\n \n Regardless, according to the rules of the UN, which WE AGREED TO FOLLOW, a security council resolution is required for use of force unless immediate action would furhter aggrevate the situation (i.e your enemy is rolling across your border).\n \n There is simply no way to view the war in Iraq as a legal military enterprise.\n \n \n2. blind patriotism? ha ha ha. reverring the US way of life? HA HA HA.\n i am an immigrant from what i perceive to be a better culture than yours.\n why is democracy good for the ME? because we all want power. democracy grants at least an illusion of such.\n why isn't it good for the ME? status quo preserver are we?\n\n \n It isn't good for the ME because they do not have toe social and cultrual tradition to support it. The ME society is based largely on a system of tribal law and steeped in a tradition of moral and ethical behavior (even in the absence of islam). \n \n \n3. hitler was not democratic elected to run germany, he forced the Kaiser to do so. review your history. and the only way Nazi liberated was to liberate the soul from the body. get real.\n\n \n Ok, he was appointed as chancelor under a democratic governement. Is that better?\n \n The nazis were certain liberating. What, after all, is involved in liberating people if not their \"salvation\" from a system with which you disagree and installation of your own system, which you feel is superior?\n \n Do you really think that he (Hitler) just set out to terrorise Europe? Of course not, the very suggestion is rediculous. Hitler was not only about conquring lands and people, Hitler was trying to spread the ideaology of germany and theri culture. He was vanquishing inferior political and cultural systems and replacing them with his own. \n \n Mussolini actually referred to Italy's military agression AS \"liberation\", and referred to the actions as \"giving the gift of fascism to opporessed people\". The italians under mussolini did not feel that they were oppressed, they thought they were free. They were spreading freedom.\n \n The romans, who were certainly conquoring nations, and taking the population of those nations as slaves, felt they were spreading civilization and culture, as did the british. It could be said they were \"liberating\" people from barbarity. \n \n Seldom do wars of \"liberation\" hold up under the microscope of history, and frankly, when america has fallen in importance ont he world stage, a process that is already well on its way, I find it highly doubtful that the \"liberating\" aspect of the war in Iraq will even be a consideration.\n \n \nwe are born and bred for war. get over your fantasy that we are somehow peaceful. its not about the elimination of war, it is making the war we fight for worthwhile to make us, humanity, betterm stronger.\n\n \n You want to compare body counts, bud? I would almost guess I have hacked more people apart with a machete than you have killed in you entire life. \n \n So, we move in and we \"liberate\" a nation. History has shown (and I know you hate the history argument), that what you get is either a puppet government, always under the shadow of the conquring nation, or the conqurign nation installs a governemtn which has not proven itself to the population, so you end up with a weak national government which resorts almost immediatly to tyranny and treachery and cruelty in order to control the population. We have seen this time and again in Africa. We have seen it in eastern Europe. \n \n We fight wars NOT to strengthen humanity, but to maintain the staus quo. We fought Iraq in order to assure that tehy did not become a major regional power. Can you imagine a much worse scenario for the US than an Iraq that was actually capable of defending not only itself, but the entire middle east, against US military agression? We would loose all power and authority in the region. THAT is what we fought for in gulf I, and then in gulf II, we fought to maintain the prevelance of the Petro dollar as the world oil exchange currency. No more, no less. Killing Iraqis by the tens fo thousands is no way to liberate them, nor is leaving their entire nation in ruin.\n \n Now we are in a difficult situation. US intervention has essentially been denied by the Iraqi people. Our guys lost the election. Allawis ticket was \"our ticket\" and they managed to garner less than 15% of the total vote. Sistanis ticket basically won, and the deals with the Kurds are already cut. We are being kept in coutnry to help enforce the current government, and as a means of ensuring that we do not try to abscond on our responsibility to rebuild the country, the cost of which may well top a trillion dollars. \n \n \n4. we shoot our own as well, your point is? preservation of life at all cost? spoken like someone who has never felt true political oppression. there nothing is worth sacrificing your life for, or even a life for?\n and i am glad we haad enough troops to force 18 millions to vote. cramming our way of life my XXX. sounds more like racism gussied up as white man's guilt.\n\n \n Yes, and they essentially voted against us. During a time when we are looking at Iran as a definate enemy, we have handed them a POWERFUL ally. \n \n Again, you want to compare body counts we can.

Second and third tier nations. The name, Coalition of the Willing, has since been retired by the current administration due to declining membership after payment. Don't take my condemnation of that action as an idealistic notion or statement, I'm old school and believe one doesn't attack another sovereign nation unless in retaliation for a direct physical attack on one's self. The public deception using WMDs was pathetic and illustrates final desperation created by progressive political corruption spreading over several administrations attempting to perpetuate 'polished' economic reporting. Acceptable economic numbers are the basis of US public acceptance and election of our leadership, nothing else. Unless, of course we're actually attacked by another sovereign nation.\n \n I've read Patriot 1 and outlines of what's termed Patriot 2, which includes interstate transportation restrictions and serious loss of civil liberties. Everything was taken from contingency documentation in place and ready for emergency legislation in the event of national disasters or war, as is standard for most governments. \n \n US intelligence, primarily the FBI as the CIA refused to support administration claims of WMDs and has since been gutted, mistakenly surmised, after the fact, that Bin Laden's vulnerability was financial in nature, so the justice department reconstructed due cause using unlimited financial information access without due cause as a rationalization. Sure helped in drug and organized crime trophy convictions, but, as usual, we were far off the mark as there is nothing conventional about our current circumstances.",

   "1. reread the SC resolutions leading up to the iraq war. last was about dire consequences if iraq fail to comply. it left both vague, thus legal opportunity for the cancellation of the ceasefire.\n\n \n Wong answer. The language of the last resolution was carefully chosen, and specifically, it was chosen so as not to convey permission for a military intervention. Originally we pushed for a resolution that promised military intevention if they failed to cpmply. We could not get this passed. When we decided to go to war, we pushed for a resolution authorizing military intervention. When it became obvious that we were not going to get it passed, we withdrew the resolution. Then we went to war. \n \n According to the ruels of the UN, which we agreed to follow, and which we commonly refer to as \"international law\", only through specific authorization by the security council can the use of force be allowed unless your nation is under immediate attack. The idea of a military intervention was advanced to the security council twice, and twice rejected, once when they passed the original resolution and once when we tried to push the new one through. Not only did the UNSC noty authorise the use fo force as international law requires, they specifically rejected the idea. \n \n Any further action in regards to the last resolution would have required further UN action to be legal. They were unwilling to take those actions. This is likely because Saddam was complying with the last resolution. The key points were access for inspectors, whcih was granted immeditly, and rewlease of requested documents, which were literally delivered by the truckload. In light of this, nations that were not just serving a idealogical agenda could not see any reason for intervention.\n \n \n2. the ME has plenty of social and cultural forces to support democracy. even if you leave aside turkey and israel. even if you leave aside democratic middle easterners participating in western democracy.\n perhaps you should read arab news more regularly.\n\n \n I read a coupleof Arab newspapers every day, though by the time I get them they are 3 days old (I am not willing to pay the extra for same day delivery since it amounts to several hundred dollars per year).\n \n I said \"they don't have the social and cultural traditions to support it\" NOT \"they dont have the social and cultural forces to support it\". Two differnt things. \n \n \n3. oh please, the nazi/fascist had no intention of liberating anyone. they saw themselves as the master race and the others were to serve them, not to join them. you can make the case for some roman conquests, mostly of the germanic tribes, as an attempt to bring civilization. but again this isn't liberation now is it? your use of the word liberation is definitely too liberal and not common usage.\n\n \n And yet, they did. When you go out to \"liberate\" people and force your ideaology on them, you are working from the premise that your system is better than theirs. This is what these tyrants were doing, and it seems pretty unlikely that, when viewed under the microscope of history, the US will be viewed any differently for our efforts to force our political and economic systems on other nations.\n \n \n4. body counts? ha ha ha. is that what is deemed of value on this board, how many people we have killed? ha ha ha.\n we fight war both for change and to change. those that have fight to keep, those that don't will always fight to take. and there is no way in hell we all can have the same. just not human reality.\n some wars produce good results, some produce bad ones.\n some peace produce bad results, some produce good ones.\n lets not gloss over the reality inorder to expound some bias agenda.\n its not the wars we fight but the peace we make. absence of war is not peace. peace is not security nor liberty.\n\n \n You are right. I was slightly offended by the suggestion that I was some kind of peacenik holding an unrealist and idealistic view on war and the value of life, especially when coming from somebody whose experince in war has apparently been limited to watching it on TV while you sit on your XXX and eat cheetos. \n \n \n5. now who is being the patriot? us vs them.\n i expect all countries to act in their people best interests. they are failures when they don't.\n but regarding iraq allying with iran, you can't seem to get beyond your inherent disdain for middle easterners or muslims to appreciate the forces of iraqi politics beyond broad swatches of shia and fundamentalism.\n it is iraq that iran fear more than the US.\n\n \n Wrong answer. WAY WRONG answer. It was Iraq under saddam that the Iranians feared, not Iraq in geenral (that is just stupid). The Iranians feared Iraq under saddam because Iraq was the most western of Arab nations. They were afraid that his ideaology would spread to Iran as it did to Syria. Under shia leadership, especially with somebody like Chalibi, who is a STRONG supporter of IRan, Iraq becomes an asset to Iran, not an enemy. I believe that there is currently some kind of moronic garbage being spewed by the bush administration suggesting that democracy will now sweep the Middle east. This is such poppycock. We have certainly seen changes in lebanon as far as the syrians being removed. This is NOT the result of a democratic Iraq, rather the result of a particularly horrific assasination there that the Syrians were supposedly behind.\n \n What they see int he ME as far as Iraqi democracy so far is a LOT of dead Iraqis, a nation destroyed, and a more restrictive, more fundamentalist government on the horizon than was there before. \n \n \n6. yeah, you are strong and i am weak! is it because you are white and i am not? perhaps i am not ready to have self determination and such.\n or perhaps because i want for my people what you have foolishly deemed common and useless, things like freedom and liberty, things white man have constructed rather than inate in all humans.\n but wait, you have a higher body count! yay!\n\n \n Your position is weak, and rather pathetic. \n \n I am all for self determination for everybody. Unfortunatly, \"self determination\" and invasiona dn occupation, followed by that foreing nation mandating what kind of governmetn you may have, is the EXACT opposite of self determination. If I hold a gun to a girls head and tell her to blow me, that is rape, evn if she does not bite.\n \n \n7. current US government tyranical! lol ... oh wait! someone is banging on my door telling me they are with the government!\n\n \n You might not want to answer it, since under current administration policy, tey have th right to haul you off secretly and hold you at a US military base, on US soil, without benifit of trial or counsel, and they can hold you indefinatly. \n \n If they say they are from the NID (national intelligence directorate), you might want to be especially careful, since the NID is accountable to NOBODY, and your civil rights are only protected by a civil rights compliance officer, appointed byt the Director of national intelligence, and answerable ONLY to the director of national intelligence. \n \n Thats right, folks, we now have our very own autonomous secret police!

   "These are all interesting points and, unfortunately, many of these issues are so complex that there can be arguements made on both sides. Adding my own two cents about the validity of anti-Western grievances:\n \n 1) US support for Israel: \n My own view is that the US is too one-sided in its support for Israel. I do believe that we should support them enough so that they would not be overrun in a potential Arab invasion. I may not believe that there was much justice in how the country was first formed, but letting the Arab states destroy Israel after so many generations would be certainly more injust at this point. However, our government too easily overlooks the human rights violations of the Israelis against the Palestinians, which we would condemn if Israel were not our allie. Our media also is too biased against the Palestinians - stressing the suicide bombing incidents without showing the underlying desperate circumstances which lead such young men and women to take such horrid measures. Our support should be much more conditional than it currently is.\n \n 2) US support for repressive Arab regimes, as in Saudi Arabia:\n I have mixed views here. I would love to see the Middle East become democratic and, from discussions with many people of Middle Eastern origin, it seems that democracy is something that would be desired by most Muslims (though perhaps not in the same format as ours - ex. with some basis of laws on Islam). However, if some of these repressive regimes were overturned, I am not at all confident that democracy would be the result. In Saudi Arabia, for example, so many children have been taught extremist Islamic doctrine that I would be concerned that Saudi Arabia would end up being run by Islamic fanatics. Muslims I have talked to think that a gradual transition of government in the form of political, economic and educational reforms would be the wisest path. Also, from the point of view of US involvement, the Saudis do have a very significant financial investment in the US and, if US policy turns substantially against that government, they do have the capability of causing us much economic harm. That said, I agree that we are quite hypocritical in how we judge our allies vs. how we judge other non-aligned countries that may even have less repressive regimes - at least we could be a wee bit more honest in our appraisal. The American people are not so stupid that they would not be able to take such honesty.\n \n 3) The influx of Western culture into the Middle East, which is viewed by many Muslims as very morally lax, particularly where sexual morals and women's rights are concerned:\n I have mixed views here too. After all, as far as I know, no one is forcing anyone in the Middle East to accept Western culture. It is attractive in itself and that is why it spreads so easily. I remember meeting a Portuguese man once who was proud of the fact that there were no McDonalds in Lisbon (no one went so they all went out of business). If people were not interested in Western culture then it would not spread. Another point that I've noticed is that people of Middle Eastern origin have a distorted view of our morality. For example, they seem to assume that most Western women are \"loose\" and interpret the wearing of the more revealing fashions popular in the West as invitations to sexual propositions. Western culture may have more personal freedoms (which I personally support wholeheartedly) but the image of the immorality of the West in the Muslim mind seems to be very much exaggerated.\n \n 4) The US invasion of Iraq, which I hear is viewed mainly as an attempt to take over oil reserves.\n My own view is that we were not justified in our invasion (Iraq was no threat to us - terrorist or otherwise) but, now that we are there, we have a certain responsibility to clean up the mess that we made. I just don't have a good answer on how to achieve it. The Sunni's understandably don't want to be a minority voice in a country run by those who they previosly oppressed. Perhaps a division of the country would be best. No easy solution seems to be presenting itself.\n \n 5) The pervasive view that the West is out to attack Islam itself, thus justifying jihad in their minds.\n Though there are certain groups in the US that may hold all of Islam responsible for the terrorist attacks and may indeed want to defeat Islam, I still think that the majority of Americans can differentiate between the fanatical Muslims and the majority that are more moderate. I may have quite negative views of Bush, but at least one can say that his rhetoric was not aimed at all Muslims and he did take some pains to make this clear. I disagree that democracy is anti-Islamic since most Muslims I have talked to have told me that most Muslims would support democracy (though not always a secular democracy).",

Israel has treated the palestenians so horribly to date that it will likely be at least 2 generations, maybe more, before there is any kind of end to the violence.\n \n The big problem seems to be the fact that the isralies, on taking over the area, gave a bunch of palestenain land to jewish settlers that they had no right to. This was land that had been in palestenian familes for hundreds, nd in some cases, over 1000 years. That is not just something you forget about.\n \n The big issue in Irael is Jewish control. If they treated the palestenians as equals, gave them Israeli citizenship, they woud quickly take over the nation since they very nearly outnumber the israleis. As is, the israelis are implementing marriage restrictions and citizenship restrictions in order to assure that jewish control is maintained because with birth rates as they are now, Jews will soon be outnumbered by arabs even without palestenian considerations. \n \n Personally, I find it distasteful that the US is supporting such a racist country. Israle is no better than S Africa during apartheid.\n \n \n2) US support for repressive Arab regimes, as in Saudi Arabia:\n I have mixed views here.

The American people are not so stupid that they would not be able to take such honesty.\n\n \n You are making the erronius assumption here that democracy automatically equals freedom. This is not necessarily the case. There are plenty of democracies out there where freedom is a joke (Iraq is about ot become one of them), and plenty of non democratic systems where the governemtn is essentially lassie-faire and freedom is not something that is questioned, just taken for granted (take a look at parts of africa).\n \n The middle east has a history of tribal law, and frankly a history of freedom and rights that predates the formation of Great Britain. Frankly, the rest of the world ****ed it up when we decided we needed to carve the ME into countries and install governments that we felt we could deal with. The problem is that tyrants are always easier to deal with, since they have only their own interests at heart and not the interests of their people. \n \n \n \n \n3) The influx of Western culture into the Middle East, which is viewed by many Muslims as very morally lax, particularly where sexual morals and women's rights are concerned:\n I have mixed views here too. After all, as far as I know, no one is forcing anyone in the Middle East to accept Western culture. It is attractive in itself and that is why it spreads so easily.

Western culture may have more personal freedoms (which I personally support wholeheartedly) but the image of the immorality of the West in the Muslim mind seems to be very much exaggerated.\n\n \n We most certainly are forcing our culture on them. We just invaded Iraq to do so. In addition, we have formed alliances with tyrannical governments liek that of saudi arabia. We convice the house of saud that it is better for them if we westernize their nation, and the man on the street has no choice. Western culture spreads well becuase western business ethics spread well. Screw your opponent, screw you allies, make the dollar and move on is a popular way to look at the world. For centuries, business deals in the ME were sealed with a handshake and a drink (not alcoholic). A contract was essentially unheard of. You trusted in the honor of the man you were doing business with. It worked fairly well. The problem is that it ceases to work if neither man has any honor, which is what comes with western culture. \n \n Compared to most of the world, we in the west have no honor, and no morals, and yes, compared to women in the ME, American women are all a bunch of tramps. \n \n The problem is not at all understated. Most houses in the ME have no locks on their doors, since to pick a mans pocket in the market place is, if not acceptable, at least allowable, but to enter his home to steal from him is NOT. While there is certainly more violence int he ME, violent crimes against women are rare. Rape is incredibly rare. Child molestation is non existant. \n \n Somebody is going to pop up here and relate some story they picked up off the internet about a woman being stoned to death by her family blah blah blah. First, there is a good chance it is BS. Second, when it is not BS, the reason we hear about it is becuase it is the exception, not the rule. Here in the US, thousands of women are beat to death by their hubands each year. We don't bother getting outraged about it becuase it is not at all unusual, it is the norm. \n \n \n4) The US invasion of Iraq, which I hear is viewed mainly as an attempt to take over oil reserves.\n My own view is that we were not justified in our invasion (Iraq was no threat to us - terrorist or otherwise) but, now that we are there, we have a certain responsibility to clean up the mess that we made.

I disagree that democracy is anti-Islamic since most Muslims I have talked to have told me that most Muslims would support democracy (though not always a secular democracy).\n\n \n Muslims certainly support democracy. The tribal type of governemtn they used for thousands of years was a form of democracy. THe question is not whether they will accept democracy, the question is whether or not that will support a western style democracy. The answer to that seems to be iffy at best. \n \n A good example of a democratic nation in the ME would be jordan. Yes, Jordan is a monarchy, but there are democratic functions built in there. And, oddly enough, they managed this without being \"liberated\". Their system is based on traditional ME tribal government, and it seems to work well for them.",

   "So, two wrongs make a right? Israel has treated the palestenians so horribly to date that it will likely be at least 2 generations, maybe more, before there is any kind of end to the violence.\n \n ...\n \n Personally, I find it distasteful that the US is supporting such a racist country. Israle is no better than S Africa during apartheid..\n\n As I mentioned in my post, I believe that US support of Israel should be conditional. By conditional, I mean that we should strongly push for Israel to pull back its settlements in the West Bank (I think they are already doing so in Gaza), and allow for autonomous full self-government in the Palestinian areas. This means pulling back their soldiers to Israeli borders, getting rid of the network of Israeli roads and roadblocks within Palestinian territory, etc. On the flip side, the Palestinians should agree to stop the suicide bombings and to not be a military threat to Israel (for example, not building up a potentially offensive military, as was the US deal with Japan and Germany after World War II). Israel has certainly badly mistreated the Palestinians - I have no dispute about that. Palestinians have also mistreated Israeli citizens via suicide bombings but that has caused damage on a much smaller scale. I would love to see Israel pay the Palestinians reparations but suspect that that is highly unrealistic at this point.\n \n However, I do believe that Israel does have the right to exist now after so many generations. This is a tricky issue. Yes, two wrongs do not make a right, but the generations of Palestinians whose land was taken away (I mean the land in Israel proper) are mostly long gone by now. We white Americans had stolen land from all of the various Native American tribes - this was certainly a great wrong. Does that mean that we should give all of that land back to their descendants? I and nearly all Americans would say no - too many generations have passed, it would be unjust to all of the current American generations. So, how many generations have to pass before it becomes too late to reverse things? I don't have a good answer, but I think Israel has passed that stage. Note: I am talking about the main part of Israel, not their settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, which I believe should be dismantled.\n \nYou are making the erronius assumption here that democracy automatically equals freedom. This is not necessarily the case. There are plenty of democracies out there where freedom is a joke (Iraq is about ot become one of them), and plenty of non democratic systems where the governemtn is essentially lassie-faire and freedom is not something that is questioned, just taken for granted (take a look at parts of africa).\n\n By democracy, I mean ACTUAL and REAL democracy, not the \"democracies only in name\" that have occurred in history, probably including the one that is arising near-term in Iraq. My folks immigrated to the US from Poland, where they did have so-called democratic elections, but when all candidates are from the communist party, this was far from a real democracy. \n \n I think a democracy can be REAL and still not be based on the Western model. For example, many Muslims would apparently like Islam to form a basis of their laws. I believe that laws can be based on moderate forms of Islam and still produce a relatively free society. I hope that we let Iraq become such a democracy, if that is their wish.\n \nWe most certainly are forcing our culture on them. We just invaded Iraq to do so. In addition, we have formed alliances with tyrannical governments liek that of saudi arabia. We convice the house of saud that it is better for them if we westernize their nation, and the man on the street has no choice.

You trusted in the honor of the man you were doing business with. It worked fairly well. The problem is that it ceases to work if neither man has any honor, which is what comes with western culture.\n\n I always got the impression that the influx of Western culture that the people of the Middle East were most critical of is the influx of Western morals, as propagated through films, advertisements, etc. Many young Muslims apparently are attracted to the freer lifestyles of the West, which interferes with the more traditional Islamic lifestyle of their parents. \n \nCompared to most of the world, we in the west have no honor, and no morals, and yes, compared to women in the ME, American women are all a bunch of tramps. \n I would disagree to the extent to which this is true. Yes, there are quite a bit more \"loose\" women in the West than in Islam, but the great majority of women in the West are monogamous, or generally single-partnered. Sex and violence sells in the movies and advertisements so our films generally show much looser sexual morals than you see in everyday life. This is true for other moral issues as well. Yes, we have more immoral people but most people are relatively moral.",

Palestenian citizens of surrounding states are treated like any other citizen. It is the palestenian refugees who have problems. This is always a problem when it comes to refugees. They use up your resources, eat your food, drink your water, and you don't really get anything in return. They are not citizens, so obviously they don't get the rights of a citizen. \n \n I would certainly hope that palestenians are treated better in israel, or at least in the the palestenian sections, sinc ein all reality they should be RULING those sections, and without israewls illegal occupation forces holding a gun to their head. Yhey are not treated well in israel proper, in fact they are treated FAR WORSE than even palestenian refugees in other nations in israel proper. If israel is going to hold continue to occupy palestenian areas, they need to go ahead and make all those palestenians full citizens. If not, they need to get out and let those palestenians get their own country up and running, and without illegal \"security walls\" choking the place to death.\n \n The problem with this is that either way, israel quickly slips into obscurity and dies as a jewish state.

   "what is a Nation \n \nIn common usage, terms such as nation, country, land and state often appear as near-synonyms, i.e., for a territory under a single sovereign government, or the inhabitants of such a territory, or the government itself; in other words, a de jure or de facto state.\n \n In a somewhat more strict sense, however, nation (ethnos) denominates a people in contrast to country which denominates a territory, whereas state expresses a legitimised administrative institution. Confusingly, the terms national and international are used as technical terms applying to states, see country.\n\n \n 1. there is little historical evidence to suggest that there was a distinct nation (ethnos) of palestininians prior to the territory of palestine, just as for most of the middle east. with time a sense of ethnos was created secondary to the territory of palestine.\n \n 2. no nations deserve their own nationstate. nationstates are built, earn, and won with blood and sweat. i have no problem with the palestinians trying to build their own nationstate; but that doesn't mean they deserve one. conversely, the israeli do not have a right to a nationstate of israel, but they have earn it and won it, and have continued to be successful doing so. now how one go about building a nationstate will affect the value, quality, and viability of one's nationstate.\n \n 3. nation racism. the above definition should clarify that. most nationstates exist because a nation (ethnos) have worked, earn, and won their nationstates. thus most nationstates are fairly homogenous ethnos wise and most retain political and economic power for their own nation (ethnos). as i said, the US, canada, australia are notable countries that have demphasized or lacked a distinct nation a priori. in the case of the israeli-palestinian, palestinian can actually become citizen of israel. afaik this is not the case for palestinians in jordan, syria, or egypt.\n \n 4. as all nations are inherantly \"racist\" i do not see the racism of the israeli to be a particular problem than that of germany, french, italians, japanese, or any other. as you suggested, minority rights and privileges must be considered. but as you know, it has to be functional rights and privileges rather what the government may or may not declare to be the case.\n \n 5. genocide. i'd hardly call what the israeli doing to the palestinian genocide. there is no systematic program or ideation to wipe out the palestinians. if anything, the arabs and palestinians are bent of wiping out the jews.\n \n 6. i am neither a westerner nor a jew. if anything, i recognize my antisemitic ideation and take precaution not to fall prey to it rather than sugar coat it and rationalize it based on false historical pretext, media constructed sensationalism, or self elative propaganda.\n \n 7. i believe in right of conquest. that doesn't mean the conquered should be badly treated. like all things, some wars are good, others are not. some conquest are good, others are not. you keep what you earn and you sow what your reap. the US conquered land from the indians. the franks from the gauls, the italians from the etruscans, and etc etc etc. it hardly matters as i don't believe civilized history started with codification of international boundaries after ww2. how you treat the conquered says more about you than the possession or conquests.",

   "It's not mere \"semantics\" to point out that the glib charge of \"racism\" against other people of essentially the same race, is absurd.\n\n racism in popular usage is to describe descrimination against a population, not just a race. it is equally valid when the japanese does it against the koreans and the aryans against the jews, afterall there are only caucasian, negroid, and mongoloid \"races\" (which is antiquated by being based on skin color rather than genetic analysis, which is still secondary in significance to culture).\n \n \nMain Entry: race\n Function: noun\n Etymology: Middle French, generation, from Old Italian razza\n 1 : a breeding stock of animals\n 2 a : a family, tribe, people, or nation belonging to the same stock b : a class or kind of people unified by community of interests, habits, or characteristics <the English race<\n 3 a : an actually or potentially interbreeding group within a species; also : a taxonomic category (as a subspecies) representing such a group b : BREED c : a division of mankind possessing traits that are transmissible by descent and sufficient to characterize it as a distinct human type\n 4 obsolete : inherited temperament or disposition\n 5 : distinctive flavor, taste, or strength\n\n \n \n \nIf you were not taking sides in this dispute and attempting to dismiss the Palestinian cause isofar as it requires concessions by Israel, then I'm not the only one in the discussion who has \"misunderstood\" you. Perhaps, if you wish to continue the exchanges, you could summarise your point of view and remove all the ambiguities with which you have clouded the issue to the point of opacity. \n\n you have made too many assumptions. very \"either you are with us or against us\".\n i have not dismissed the palestinian cause, just the false premis that israel is the root of the problem.\n 1. i would dismis the Palestinian use of terrorism to win statehood against a militarily superior foe (tactically unsound), alienating the one external entity that can best help their cause (the US), and setting a foundation for a culture of death rather than life (what sort of state will palestine be then when it is better to die than to live, better to kill than to build?)\n 2. secondly, their incalcitrant adherence to a false premis perpetuated and accentuated by their supposed allies, the surrounding arab states, allowed them to be used by the islamofascists. thus as long as their suffering and plight is useful, it will be allowed to continued by the very same islamofascists.\n 3. thirdly they have bought into the european concept of nations' states, as if they need a palestine to survive as a people/ethnos/nation, the very same error that gave rise to the state of israel.\n these are the gross errors that have led them to this point and until they acknowledge this, and they are beginning to, the situation as is will perpetuate to their detriment.\n \n the corresponding errors in the west that have served only to perpetuate the problem are #2 and #3 along with \n 4. guilt, from imperialism to the holocost. without this guilt the \"problem\" would have faded and be allowed a peaceful political solution locally rather than flaming the fuel of middle east terrorism. it could have been more like south africa.\n \n all these points i have really previously addressed.",
