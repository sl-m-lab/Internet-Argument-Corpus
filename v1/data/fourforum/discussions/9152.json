   "United States Congress is going to acknowledge Armenians genocide at the beginning of 20century. The inevitable has occurred! Americans remembered about us at last! Well, I understood that Armenian lobby is the alert. But we have only one problem with it. This is history only and we'll never make one and a half million Armenians come back.\n Look, in present discrimination of Armenian population is continuing to present day in Georgia for instance. Armenians are discharged from office, officials close down their stores. Moreover police is organizing regular raids in Armenians blocks and for a long time they found there drags, weapons and other! Georgia turned into concentration camp for Armenians! Saakashvili is realizing home policy that no-Georgians have to leave Georgia. And it will be better for you but at a pinch you will killed by soldiers. I think that American brothers drew their attention at the problem of Armenians in Black Sea area late.",
