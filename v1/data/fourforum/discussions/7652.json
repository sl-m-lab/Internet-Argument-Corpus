While this was going on, Terri Schiavo's life was hanging on a thread by an out of control Florida appealate court judge. Her \"husband\" was more interested in the money from the settlement, rather than truly caring for his wife (remember he had a girlfriend and fathered two children with her).

There is nothing to connect the two cases mentioned since Mr. Herbert was in a coma termed Minimally Conscious and Ms Schiavo was in a Persistent Vegetative State.\n Dono",
