   "I'm always hearing crazy creationists on this forum saying how \"flawed\" evolution is, but they never offer any proof of their subject. The reason for that is, that Creationism can never be proved or disproved. I find that illogical, that you choose an absurd hypothesis for the next logical explanation.\n \n First off, the scientific method goes:\n \n 1) Form Hypothesis\n \n 2)Test hypothesis\n \n 3)Form conclusion (or theory)\n \n *correct me if I wrote the scientific method wrong*\n \n For example, I hypothesize that if I hold a match up to this piece of paper, it will burn. Now, i will test my hypothesis by holding up a match to this peice of paper. I observe that it is burning, and I record my data. My hypothesis was correct, and now I have a theory that if I hold a match up to a piece of paper, it will burn. I know thats not the greatest analogy, but it will have to do.\n \n Now, lets try evolution. Form hypothesis: (you all know what evolution is). Test hypothesis: (of course, all of the hundreds of complex studies known to prove evolution, most have been verified). Form conclusion: the theory of evolution.\n \n Now, lets try Creationism. Form hypothesis: God made the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th 6,000 years ago. Test hypothesis: *there have been no known and verified tests to prove creationism*. Form Conclusion: *there is no conclusion or theory to creationism*.\n \n Now that I laid it out for you, can someone tell me why an untested, untheorized hypothesis is believed by many over a known and tested theory? And furthermore, why should it be taught in schools? Creationism should be treated like it doesn't exist. There is almost no evidence to support it, and its mostly all speculation. It has no weight in the scientific community, and should be treated like little Jonny's theory of little fairy men that live underground creating the whole world, and it certainly shouldn't be taught in any school. Nothing should be taught over a theory, unless its a law. It certainly should not be a hypothesis.\n \n \n Which creationist here can offer a logical explanation for their beliefs over that of the theory of evolution? Most likely, they can't. All they can do is point out small holes in the theory of evolution. The problem is, there are small holes in every theory, sometimes even laws. Even little Jonny can point out flaws in evolution, but that will make his fairy hypothesis no more truthful than evolution. The same goes for creationists. So I ask again. Where is the logic?",

   "I've noticed that \"scientific creationism\" has largely gone out of style, but it has been replaced by a more sophisticated & updated form of pseudoscience - Intelligent Design. The old school creationists seem to be taking a new tact of proclaiming evolution to be a religion rather than true science. That way they can side step the scientific method altogether, and say that evolution & creation are just two competing world views based on belief. Then they can feel justified in trying to cast doubt on the scientific validity of evolution without having to present evidence for creation. It's a very effective strategy in that it lets them off the hook while it gives them an excuse for focusing all their energy on trying to poke holes in evolutionary theory.\n \n One of the specific ploys I've seen them use time & again is to say that natural selection is either a tautology, or else an untestable theory because it is unfalsifiable and has no predictive value. They'll point out that M + NS explains nothing because it explains everything from cooperation to competition, from increases in complexity to vestigial structures. Of course, NS isn't a tautology because it doesn't explain the existence of nonadaptive features. But the creationist smoke screen still convinces plenty of gullible people. I think they realize that creationism or Intelligent design are unfalsifiable without predictive powers (save for biblical prophesies) so they must put the focus on evolution to take it off creation/design.",

The \"you believe in evolution\" argument has been around for at least that long. In my experience it has been a waste of breath to try to convince creationists that I don't believe in evolution any more than they do. As I recall, the argument was even presented in a court case back in the late 60s, or maybe it was the early 80s. I could be wrong.

Why is this so hard to understand?\n Maybe I'm misunderstanding the objection?\nThe tautology argument is rooted in the Spencerian epithet for natural selection, \"survival of the fittest.\" Which organisms survive? The fittest. Which are the fittest? Those who survive. But of course, \"survival of the fittest\" isn't a very good statement of the theory of natural selection. Darwin didn't like it and only began using it due to the encouragement of Wallace after it had become popular. It first appeared in \"On The Origin Of Species\" in the 4th edition, and it was never used without an explicit reference to natural selection.\n \n I never saw natural selection as being in the slightest tautological before. I too have found natural selection to be painfully obvious. I see what you are saying, but I don't actually see that as a tautology. Early on I learned that natural selection was differential reproductive success. Perhaps I had good teachers.

Those mosquitoes that aren't drawn to the zapper live; those that are die. Those animals that can withstand the frigid winter live; those that can't freeze. Why is this so hard to understand?\n \n \n \n prschuster:\n The key, here, is that *ADAPTIVE* changes are passed on to future generations via differential reproduction rates. This distinguishes it from neutral selection, genetic drift and gene flow. Those other nonadaptive changes come along for the ride, but they are not essential to evolutionary adaptation (unless a neutral trait is selected for later on). If natural selection (NS) were a tautology, it would be indistinguishable from these other mechanisms. Also, without the existence of adaptive changes being passed down to future generations, there would be no way to falsify NS or to use it for predictive purposes. I think this was what Karl Popper failed to understand when he first characterized NS as a tautology. \n \n But we can make some very basic predictions based on NS. We can predict that the artiodactyls that evolved into whales & dolphins would have progressively more aquadynamic features because they are adaptive. If we repeatedly saw maladaptive features evolving in lineages, like the reduction of limb girdles in the ichthyostegid line, then it would be a serious problem for the theory. But we almost always see changes which make the organism better adapted - not maladapted. Anyway, this is the crux of my response to the tautology argument. In short, NS does not happen as a result of differential reproductive success; NS causes that success. \n \n One very good analogy I have seen is taken from a phrase used in sports: \"May the best team win\". The best team usually wins the majority of their games BECAUSE they are the best team. They have better hitters, pitchers, quarter backs, goalies etc... They aren't better because they win more games; they win more games because they are better. In other words, just because a weak team may occassionally beat a better team it doesn't follow that they suddenly become the better team. No one would make that assertion. Neither should anyone assert that NS can be defined exclusively on the basis of which traits happen to be passed onto the next generation.",
