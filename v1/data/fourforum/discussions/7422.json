   "The Not-So-Super Model\n By FREDRIK SEGERFELDT\n January 24, 2006\n STOCKHOLM -- The Swedish model is back in fashion. Seeking ways to meet globalization's challenges, think tanks and researchers across Europe are looking northward for inspiration. The Scandinavian model is even on the agenda for the EU's March summit, which will focus on jobs and growth.\n \n As a Swede, I am naturally flattered by all the attention. And my country is wonderful in many ways. But Europeans should probably look more seriously at Sweden's much-vaunted economy and welfare state. Up close, the cracks in the fa\u00e7ade are easier to see. They're worth dwelling on, if only so others don't repeat our mistakes.\n \n In the past decade, the Swedish economy has grown at a slightly better clip than the EU average thanks to market-oriented reforms that took place from 1985 to 1995. Sweden joined the EU, gave the central bank independence, deregulated some markets, shored up public finances and introduced modest cuts in taxes and welfare schemes.\n \n However, falling export prices and rising import prices have softened the improvement of the relative living standard for the average Swede. During the last decade Sweden has gained only one position in the OECD table for GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing power.\n \n By the same token, Sweden saw impressive productivity growth during the 1990s: 2.5% per year. But productivity growth per capita, a more relevant measurement, topped only four industrialized countries.\n \n According to Eurostat, Sweden has the EU's smallest amount of business investment as a share of GDP. The U.N. reports that Sweden is among only 12 countries in the world with a net outflow of investments.\n \n Scandinavian labor markets vary greatly. Whereas the Danish labor market is fairly deregulated, the Swedish one is not. In fact, 18 OECD countries boast a more flexible labor market than Sweden's. This in part explains the country's high rate of unemployment. True, our nominal unemployment rate of 6.3%, according to Eurostat, is the ninth lowest in the EU. Yet even trade union specialists put total unemployment -- including those on sick leave, in early retirement or in job retraining programs -- at 20-25%. Between 1995 and 2003, employment grew faster in 11 of the 14 other \"old\" EU countries than in Sweden. In fact, the private sector employs 350,000 fewer people today than in 1965, despite population growth of about one million. The public sector -- at the taxpayer's expense -- picks up the slack.\n \n Lagging employment growth is also a result of the low level of entrepreneurship. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reports that only four of the 34 countries it surveyed have a lower level of entrepreneurial activity than Sweden. The number of self-employed Swedes has fallen by half since the early 1960s. Today more Swedes are in early retirement than are self-employed.\n \n (More)",

   "Not only is the economy doing less well than some suggest, but Sweden's celebrated welfare state is also facing serious problems. Despite an increase of almost 70% in spending since 1979, Sweden's public health-care system is coming apart at the seams. The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions reports that doctors see an average of four patients a day, down from nine in 1975. According to the Swedish Institute for Health Economics, doctors spend 50-80% of their time on administrative tasks. The number of hospital beds is down by 80% since 1975. More than 50% of patients wait over 12 weeks for an examination and then at least 12 weeks more for treatment. And Sweden ranks fourth in the OECD's table of income-related inequalities in access to health care.\n \n At the heart of the \"Swedish social model\" are the generous welfare benefits. And it is true that Sweden has the highest proportional government social spending in the EU. But its relatively low economic growth has undermined the tax base. Despite lower taxes, six EU countries spend more per capita on social policies than Sweden.\n \n Sweden has one of the lowest income gaps between rich and poor in the world, as measured by the Gini coefficient. However, this has more to do with the compressed wage structure than government redistribution. The welfare system is actually less redistributive than is often believed.\n \n Sweden's social spending is primarily aimed at the middle class. Some 82% of the taxes earmarked for social spending -- paid during an average lifetime -- is returned to the taxpayer in the form of subsidized social services and various welfare allowances. So the Swedish welfare state is more interested in regulating people's lives than promoting \"social justice.\" Billionaires receive child allowances while Stockholm has a higher proportion of homeless people than Chicago.\n \n There are many valuable lessons to be learned from the Nordic countries. The Danish labor market, the Finnish welfare system, Iceland's tax code and Sweden's openness to international trade indeed are good sources of inspiration. However, the European debate would benefit from a broader perspective on Sweden. All that glitters isn't gold, despite the government's feverish burnishing.\n Mr. Segerfeldt is a director at Timbro, a think tank based in Stockholm.",

There is no job growth, nor private sector businesses setting up in New York. So I guess that High taxes and lavish social bennies do hurt the private sector, huh? emoticon_confused",

   "Meh, this was even crappy by Timbro`s ordinary crappy standard... It`s a (partisan) political think-piece with so many holes in that it leaks. There are certainly problems in Sweden but economic growth and unemployment are not among those. At least not when put into an international perspective.\n \n Regarding economic growth. Any figures presented regarding economic growth tends to be biased. Especially when talking about swedish growth at the end of the 20th century. The 90-ies where so turbulent (as many of you allready know, we experienced an economic crash) that it becomes so easy too cook the figures by merely excluding or including certain years. The medium term growth has been good in Sweden the past decade. Much of the growth was merely recovering though. It had very little to do with free-market reforms though...\n \n Regarding unemployment: This is just insane. You can`t calculate retirees, students and disabled as unemployed. If you look at those that recieve governmentally funded job training programs and employments, the unployment figures are around 8%, the 20-25% figure is just moronic. For further discussion on the subject, I refer to http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=5485&highlight=Sweden it`s about the same report that Mr Segerfeldt refers to.\n \n Regarding investment net-outflows. This is not nesecarily a bad thing. It depends on the reason why there is a net-outflow. I don`t know enough about the Swedish situation to make any judgement on it.\n \n Regarding low entrepenourship. This is really a cultural thing, and has little to do with economic or political polycies. We tend to prefer to be employed rather than have our own bussineses. Immigrants are very keen on starting new bussineses though and I bet the majority of the small bussineses in Stockholm are owned by immigrants. This is not really a problem either as long as it doesn`t hurt the economic growth or competition.\n \n Regarding the health care system. This is a rather big issue if one would attempt to explain what has happened with the healthcare bussines in the last 20 years. I think I`ll pass on this at the moment. But if you are interested, I would suggest comparing statistics on health and healthcare costs with other countries.\n \n Regarding social programs: The spending on social programs are not the basis for the Swedish wellfare state (or the nordic model), but a universal wellfare that applies to everyone, irregardless of income or employment status.\n \n Regarding redistribution of wealth. This is just the point that the XXXXXX at Timbro never really understands (or at least refuse to acknowledge). The basis for equality is not income redistribution through taxation. That is the second best alternative. Equalised incomes is best created through empowering the labour unions and providing cost free education that increases the supply of well educated labour. This plays along with the market forces rather than interfering with them.\n \n Regarding social justice: See above\n \n I`m guessing this article is a bit old (perhaps a year?). Since Timbro is largely a partisan think-tank, they are very dependant on the partisan line regarding certain issues. And in the last years, there have been a rather dramatic (and slightly funny) shift in Swedish politics. Our largest right-wing party (the ones providing the funding for Timbro) has adopted social democratic ideals and goals and are claiming to be the greatest defenders of the swedish model with universal wellfare for everyone... There have also been some recent improvements in the economy that has not been adressed as well (economic growth is around 3,8 and unemployment is on its way down 5,2 or something at the moment)\n \n Blregh.. sorry if my refutation was a bit half-arsed. I couldn`t really take it seriously. And it`s getting late. And my dog ate my first draft.",
