   "The discussion has been interesting, but it is based on a false premise. From previous discussions with HeavenBound I am quite cognizant of the fact that she believes that evolutionary biology, cosmology, geology, nuclear physics, and other fields of science are attacks on \"Christianity.\" Of course, a rational person knows that it isn't true. It seems to me from previous experience that HeavenBound is of the opinion that scientific objections to young earth creationism are attempts to discredit christianity. What hubris on her part. Given the hundreds of sects of christianity that exist in just the U.S., and given that many of them accept evolutionary theory (officially all of the \"main line\" Christian sects do), to claim that her particular sect is the only true version is ludicrous.\n \n It is especially silly given the recent origen of christian fundamentalism. The 12 pamphlets upon which fundamentalist christianity are based were written between 1910 and 1915. They were a backlash against science - not only evolutionary theory, but cosmology, physics, geology, and on and on. And yet, fundamentalists claim that they are the only arbiters of what is true christianity.\n \n And young earth creationism as a tenet of \"christianity\" is even worse. It came about in the 1960s when Henry Morris adopted the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventist, George McCready Price. Flood geology was then and still is bogus. Fundamentalists rechristened Price's opinions as \"creation science\" and we were off to the courts.\n \n You see, what HeavenBound considers attacks on \"christianity\" aren't. I don't have a problem with Christianity. I do have a problem with those who represent it as science. I have a problem with those who want to impose their religion on all students in science classes. I do have a problem with fundamentalist efforts to impose their religion on everyone through prayer at public school events.\n \n HeavenBound or any of the other fundamentalist (my religion is the TROOTH!) debaters should take a step back and consider what they are advocating. If you don't want your religion judged as science, then stop trying to pretend that it is. Nobody really gives a rat's tootie what you want to believe, most certainly not scientists. If you don't want your beliefs to be challenged, then stop presenting them as either scientific or rational. To do so is an indication that your faith is weak. You seem to have a need to justify it beyond faith.\n \n So in response to HeavenBound's OP, none of the efforts to discredit anything about Christianity are true. What is true is that HeavenBound cannot reconcile her faith with reality and science.\n \n The answer is to stop representing your faith as science. Teach it in you home, teach it in your private school. Stand on the corner and scream at anyone who passes by. Good for you!\n \n I attack illiterates who advocate the religion is science and that it should be taught in science classes. I attack illiterates who advocate that our government should display religious symbols on buildings. I object to monumental erections by so called christians that give the appearance of approval for a particular religion by our government.\n \n I strongly object to the efforts of people like HeavenBound to impose their religion on everyone and then claim persecustion when rebuffed.",

   "** Because it's not credible **\n \n 1. Basing beliefs off faith (nothing) essentially removes reality from the equation of decision making. This is a bad thing, especially when it rises to the level where government deceisions are being influenced by \"faith\" (nothing). Just as people strive to make sure corruption does not ruin our society, we also must strive to make sure lies and illogical beliefs do not ruin our society. A theocracy is not good, according to what I hold dear (freedom), and what history, and reason, show us. Freedom requires reason, and equality, both of which are mutually exclusive to being a Christian, for instance. If it were some other religion that was prominent in the U.S. that wasn't so malignant, it might not be so bad.\n \n 2. Compassion. If someone is being lied to, I prefer to help them understand it. If people are being psychologically manipulated, I would prefer to help them understand it, and avoid it. I prefer to live in a world where my neighbor believes in reality, and not superstision. I think people give money to a church, which basically spreads lies, rather than giving that money to real, tangible things that help improve the quality of life for all people, poor, religious, or secular. Society told me the lies, and let me believe them for a long time, when I finally uncovered the truth, I felt society had let me down. I won't repeat the same mistake.\n \n 3. To sit by and let bad things happen (faith based beliefs) is apathetic. I prefer to actively try to better the world around me, and that includes correcting unreasonable or illogical claims when I encounter them. Sitting and watching a child kidnapped, when you could intervene, for example, is not what I consider a \"good\" thing. Why would I then sit by and watch other people spread lies and things that I think are ultimately harmful to society?\n \n That's just a few.\n \n -Mach",

It does not state its way is the right way. \n\n \n It just states that if you're not an atheist, you're wrong and stupid.

If one advances, the other recedes. If atheism increases in government, Christianity is decreased.\n\n \n But your logic dictates that if one religion that isn't christanity is advanced, then the rejection of religion as a whole is advanced as well. I see you have no qualms about broadcasting your idiocy to the world. \n \n \nA basic difference between Christians and atheists. You evidenty believe that EVERYTHING is bound by time.\n\n \n Um, no. I believe that for something to be able to live, it must therefore be able to die. Such is the cycle of life and death, which goes on for eternity. Therefore, under such logic, human life is the highest under either a secular or a religious view. Changing definitions of words apparently seems to fit your arguments when you fail to address the points.\n \n \nGod is the highest form of life. God cannot die, he is not bound by time.\n\n \n Then life according to you is not bound by any normal accepted means. I now declare that a diamond is the highest form of life, it cannot die, and is not bound by time. Once again I see you have no qualms about broadcasting your idiocy to the world. \n \n \nIt doesn't talk about the highest form of life because it can't comprehend it, it is mystified by it. Science is mystified by a lot of things\n\n \n Again, you show your lack of knowledge. Atheism doesn't talk about the highest form of life because it is completely irrevelant to such a ideology. Would the NRA talk about raising puppies? No, because it is outside the realm of their ideology. While science is mystified by a lot of things it hardly means that religion is correct. A classical creationist argument runs by attacking evolution and not proving creation. Hence, if you can prove they are wrong, you are therefore right without proving your stance. You are doing the same thing here. \n \n \nAnd you never do that with Christians?\n\n \n Am I doing that here? No. Besides, unlike atheists (which I am not a part of), Christians have a history of following a few leaders. Atheists have a tendency to agree on a few basic things and then never stop arguing about the rest until someone comes around and forces them to shutup at gunpoint. \n \n \nAn elected Christian politician does.\n\n \n One person is not the government. besides, that official answers to the public, hence the election.\n \n \nBetter to be dictated by the laws of an unchanging religion, than the ever changing laws of human whims. \n\n \n I don't see the difference. religious law changes from era to era, from person to person, on the whimiscal notions of the Church and religious leaders. There's absolutely no difference between the two. In fact, every accepted religious authority has changed their views on religion, and selectively picked and choosed which morals and laws they wish to follow from the bible. hence, why religion and its following does change on human whims. I again see you have no qualsm about broadcasting your idiocy to the world. \n \n \nYes you can, you can be forgiven! You can accept a free gift.\n\n \n So you're telling me tha tI can do every sacrigilious thing possible, murder millions, if billions of people and be forgiven? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nThere you go, resorting to the fraudulent action of applying the actions of a few church leaders to all of Christianity.\n\n \n If you know anything about Christanity, after the Catholic purge of \"heretics\" there were two groups, orthodox and catholicism. Both churchs denined rights like you would not believe. In fact, the entire catholic purge of heretical groups was denying them the right to practice their religion as they saw fit. Again I see you have no qualms about broadcasting your complete lack of any knowledge about history to the world. \n \n \nTwo important things about the world are ~GOOD~ vs. ~EVIL~. Science doesn't have many mathmatical formulas for them, but they exist all around us, including the government. When good vacates, evil almost always fills the void. \n\n \n Define good and evil. That changes from person to person, group to group. The pope was the symbol of satan and evil for early protestants. Was he for Catholics? Besides, you clearly avoided addressing your complete lack of any knowledge about atheism. \n \n \nRemoval of the Ten Commandments from public places would be one.\n\n \n Wow, and I now see you have no qualms about broadcasting your lack of current news as well. Removal of the 10 commandements is because they are unconsitutional. The lawyer heading the case has specifically noted why and would not have a problem if many religions were shown. \n \n It's amazing how deliberate some people go to showing publically their character flaws.",

   " \n \n I agree that if you want to pull out the terms \"Good\" and \"Evil\" you will have to define them. You will also, then also have to point to and answer some weird cases, such as good coming from evil or evil coming from good. Lets take two examples: suppose we call charity good, what if by giving someone a dollar (a good act) you cause the guy to get mugged by a greedy 'friend?' Or, let us call murder bad, what if you murder Hitler just before he rose to power? \n \n Furthermore if you want to use some sort of Utilitarian Methodology with the ends being all we look at... what of personal connections, which happen to disappear in such a dry and certitude outlook on life. \n \n Also of what relation is Good and Evil to god? Need they rest on God's existence? Are they separate from his existence? Can we keep a scorecard between good and evil within the world? What of objectivity versus subjectivity... perspectivism? Many many different scenarios are possible!\n\n \n Defining good and evil is very complex. It often has to go much further than the 'feelings' of only one generation. Good and evil are very much related to God, as he sometimes uses one to achieve the other. Sometimes over a long period of time, sometimes over a short period of time. Sometimes only a few see evil coming from good, or vice versa. Sometimes many do, only in a different generation. That's why it's very dangerous to leave decisions about it to only a few people from one generation.",

   "Where is the \"religious right\" trying to destroy the teaching of science? From all I've heard, many just want Creationism taught IN ADDITION to evolution.\n\n Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kansas, Tennessee, Ohio, Texas, Louisiana, California to name a few. It seems like there are new efforts by the scientifically illiterate to introduce their mythology into science classes every week. The first efforts were attempts to remove science by making it illegal to teach anything but creationism. While such efforts seem ridiculous now, the courts failed to see the humor and made it quite clear that science was to be taught in science classes - not religion. So creationists invented \"creation science,\" an effort to dress up mythology in scientific sounding jargon and introduce it into science classes on an \"equal time\" basis. But the courts weren't fooled. Anyway you dress it up, creationism is based on the mythology of a particular religion, even if one goes to extremes to avoid mentioning God. More recently creationists won control of the Kansas Board of Education. After investing time, effort and money in commissioning a panel of 27 scientists and science educators to rewrite the science education standards of the state, the Board of Education trashed those standards and adopted a version that had been gutted by a Missouri flat earth creationist. All but a couple of meaningless references to evolution were removed from the biology standards, all references to an old earth from the earth science standards. Two large corporations promptly abandoned plans to build large plants in Kansas and went elsewhere. Fortunately the people of Kansas threw out the creationists, then they threw out the creationist science standards and then adopted the original standards as written by the 27 member writing committee. Sadly, the people of Kansas weren't happy in making themselves the laughing stock of the nation just once, they are making a second effort to eliminate science from their schools by again electing enough creationists to control the board. Thus, a committee to hear testimony on the standards is composed of all YECs.\n \n If you would like to understand the controversy you can read some of the significant court decisions. Epperson v. Arkansas (393 U.S. 97), Segraves v. State of California (Sacramento Superior Court No. 278978), McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education (529 F. Supp. 1255), Edwards v. Aguillard (482 U.S. 578), Webster v. New Lenox School District No. 122 (917 F. 2d 1004), Peloza v. Capistrano School District (917 F. 2d 1004), and Freiler v. Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education (No. 94-3577)\n \n Also, I'll post the testimony of Dr. Stephen Case of the Center for Science Education at the University of Kansas and who was co-chair of the Kansas science standards writing committee.\n \nAs for evangelists trying to shove their religion down your throat, welcome to the 21st Century. Everybody's trying to shove something down your throat. Ever ride a NY Subway and have the misfortune of sitting next to a Hari Krishna kook? Or walk down the street and be verbally harassed by street urchins trying to make you feel guilty for them being bums?

But still, the situations that you speak of aren't the problem. When christians wave their Bibles over their heads and scream damnation at me, I am free to do the same back or even to point and laugh. Not a problem. Where there is a problem is when the religious right spiritualists want to put symbols of their mythology on government buildings. A perfect example is Judge Roy Moore's monumental erection in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court. He had his version of the 10 commandments engraved on a 5 ton rock and snuck it in in the middle of the night. This imposition of his religion on everyone was somehow claimed to be the free exercise of religion, and efforts to have it removed were fought with the rationale that to do so would violate Judge Moore's free exercise of religion. The Federal Courts saw it differently, as did the Alabama Court of Judicial Review - they removed Judge Moore from office.\n \nOur sensibilities are being bombarded in every direction, it's a sign of the times. You either learn to cope or move.\n\n Except when the assault from the religious right is an unlawful attempt to co-opt our government to impose religious mythology on everyone.",

   "What was the timeframe for his testimony? Much of what you cited aren't current.\n\n Last month. The subcommittee is currently in session. It is a second try by Kansas creationists to remove evolution and any reference to an old earth or an old universe from the science curriculum.\n \n What I cited shows history of creationists to impose their religion on everyone under the guise of science.\n \n...Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas declared that such monuments should be allowed.\n\n But you can always count on Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas to be pretty weak when it comes to defending 1st Amendment rights to freedom of religion. For example, in Santa Fe Indepentant School District v. Doe (000 U.S. 99-62 (2000)) Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas thought that it was OK for a Christian prayer to be recited as a part of the procedings of an official school function. The other 6 Justices thought not. They thought that the actions of the school district violated both freedom of religion clauses.\n \n I once mentioned to a lawyer that I thought Scalia was a XXXXX. He was puzzled and said that he thought that Scalia was actually one of the better Justices - smart, centered, and rational. I referred him to some dissents that Scalia had written in freedom of religion cases. He was shocked. He couldn't believe the muddled thinking that characterized those dissents. Scalia is a bit of a Jekyll & Hyde - efficient, smart, and logical in most cases but a raving monster whenever the question is if christians should be allowed to impose their religion on all by law.\n \n Judge Moore's appeal to the Supreme Court was denied cert by the Supreme Court. In effect that means that the Supreme Court is saying that there are no new constitutional issues to be decided and that the Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. District Court were correct in their decisions. However, votes for cert by the Supreme Court aren't recorded but you can just bet that Moore was denied cert by a vote of 6-3. Guess who spoke out since then.",

Correct?\n\n \n I hope so, little green men have their excuses...but if a being suddenly turns up claiming to be God it has a hell of a lot of explaining to do. Chances we will not be alone at that point demanding our answers from a sumpreme being...from this I suppose I can draw some measure of comfort. ;)\n \n But yeah..if it came down to it, I would bet money on life outside Earth over direct and clear intervention from a supreme being. Part of me would really like there to be something there...but as much as Easyrider and Heavenbound know that they will be saved, I know that I live in a universe that just doesn't care nor has any meaning. Strange as it sounds, in a way its a far more comforting thought than anything else when you get used to it.\n \n I recognise at this point, science and logic ends leaving pure speculation and faith...but the former deals with everything I've met so far, and my faith (the worst and ultimate truth) makes me immune to anything it could be hard to cope with. Sounds bleak but you'll find a large number of atheists who find far more comfort in this truth than trying to deny what they beleive in their heart to be true. Its not everyone's point of view, that is one of the major features of Atheism- not forcing your view on anyone else because lacking any divine authority, you have no more right than they do. As to those who instantly recoil from a point of view such as mine, ask yourself if its really because you disagree with it that much or because it strikes a chord with something in you that you try to ignore. Trust me, once you accept it as a possible truth it seems no where as bleak as it did to start with and can offer comform beyond anything subserivence to a deity can offer.",

   "Ah, you clearly show you know little about fallacies. We aren't talking about that. fallacy: changing the subject. We are talking about your insane logic that dictates atheism advances if another religion other then christanity advances. Under such logic, Atheism is strong in theological states such as Saudi Arabia and Iran. emoticon_rolleyes \n\n \n Yes, that atheism advances if another religion other than Christianity advances IN THE UNITED STATES - that's what we're talking about. Since Judeo Christianity is not prominent in the cultures and governments of Saudi Arabia and Iran, it doesn't apply to them.\n \n The atheist activists that want to reduce what FEW Judeo Christian leanings our government has, can use non Judeo Christian religions to downplay Christianity. Those religions can work together WITH atheism to oppose Christianity. U.S. Atheists delight in non Christian religions, you do - your bringing up the Shinto religion proves it. You're loosely lumping all religion together - it doesn't work.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nI made no such error. Besides, you admited that some of them would not, therefore agreeing with me, and creating a internal contricition in your claims. \n\n \n That wasn't my quote. (wow it's fun to watch you get desperate) The fallacy of the general rule is \"assuming that something true in general is true in every possible case. If secular government doesn't stifle Christianity in every possible case, then you're saying it can NEVER stifle it, and it obviously can in some few, significant cases. The \"chair legs\" thing was an example from that other site that had little to do with this.\n \n \n \n \nNotice how that doesn't change the the problems in your arguments. All you are pointing out is my observation upon your style: you refuse to acknowledge and address the inherent failings of your arguments: therefore you are now guilty of the fallacy of selective reading. Selectively responding to a few, especially the weakest parts of your opponent's argument and then passing it off as the whole. \n \n \n You do realise you have completely failed to adddress the refuations of your claims? \n\n \n I see you now bring out your secret weapon. I've seen you do it so many times before with so many others here. When you get pretty far into a debate and see that you're losing, you claim your opponent has failed in EVERY WAY to prove his points. In a twisted way, it's a can't-lose method for you. The problem is, it's a calamity of fallacies, oh a multitude of fallacies. Ad Hominem, Moving Goalposts, Needling, Failure to State, some others, along with your standard, Emotive language. It makes a blanket statement that delays and frustrates your opponent, and attemps to bleed them of patience and time. If they attempt to go back and make more clear anything that they've said, then you turn up your fallacy use to further frustrate them. (usually more emotive language.) If your opponent gives up in frustration, then you have changed the SENTIMENTS, not the minds, of those who may tend to agree with you. \n \n It's been your secret weapon, but now it's not so secret anymore, is it?\n \n \n \n \nWhat does this have to do with me? I'm just pointing out the lies, illogical processes and historical inaccuraies in your arguement. My position is that your argument is wrong on those reasons, and clearly does not understand the terms it uses. Therefore my personal belief upon atheism is irrevelant, and your tactic here is clearly the fallacy of changing the subject. You still realize you have yet to comment upon a refuation yes? \n\n \n Here's what it has to do with you, as someone who \"debates\". The word \"debate\" means; \"A contention of words or arguments between two matched sides\". You argue right along with atheism, then later declare that you have no part of it. You call Bush an idiot, then later when pressed, you also call Kerry an idiot. You show no PRINCIPLE. If you and I are debating, and I have principle and you don't, then it's not very matched. All you have to do is aimlessly critisize, you don't have to defend anything. When critisizing something, you almost always advance it's adversary. The fallacy of \"Failure to State\".\n \n \n \n \nYou brought the 10 commandements up. I did not. \n\n \n I brought it up in answer to YOUR question \"such as?\" The fallacies continue.\n \n \nTherefore your claim is not only false, but it's a outright fabrication: which obviously makes you not only a fraud user, but outrightly dishonest. \n\n \n The emotive language moves up a notch.\n \n \n \n \nNo, you were giving the logic that if one religion advances, that atheism advances well. You infact AGREED that if Shinto was adanvced over Christanity, that Atheism, the rejection of all religions and higher beliefs advanced as well. That is a internal contridiction YOU Agreed to. \n\n \n Because it's true. Atheism and non Judeo Christian religions can work together to oppose Christianity IN THE UNITED STATES.\n \n \n \nIt's saying A and C are opposing, yet if B advances over A, then C does as well, even when there are relatively little differences between A and B. \n\n \n Fallacy - \"Argument by Gibberish\", and a touch of \"Fast Talking\" - by not assigning meanings to the letters in your little ABC game.\n \n \nI suggest you relearn logic before posting anything new.\n\n \n I'm thinking about posting the link to the \"list of fallicious arguments\" in the \"debating techniques and styles\" forum, to get others opinions on it.

When critisizing something, you almost always advance it's adversary. The fallacy of \"Failure to State\".[/quote]\n \n I have clearly made my position: that your argument is full of lies, fallacies, and is wrong on many levels. Essentially everything you have stated is false, and my stance is that what you have attacked is unjustly hit, therefore I support what you are attacking. It;'s amazing how you can't figure that out. Besides, am I trying to win? Or merely derail your argument? Victory is not important: showing that your argument is decietful is. The fallacy only applies when one is attempting to gain victory. That is not the case here, which further shows your lack of knowledge about fallacies. \n \n \n\n I brought it up in answer to YOUR question \"such as?\" The fallacies continue.\n \n\n \n And I refuted it.

Emotive language is a appeal to the people. i don't care about the people. Your fallacies and lies clearly show you to be a dishonest, fraudlent debator. The fallacies does not apply because the audience here is irrevelant. Again, please learn how to use fallacies before accusing people of such. \n \n \n\n Because it's true.

Clearly that each represents either religion or atheism. The example was merely a physical example of your ludiacrious logic. again, the fallacy does not work. \n \n \n\n I'm thinking about posting the link to the \"list of fallicious arguments\" in the \"debating techniques and styles\" forum, to get others opinions on it.

   "I have to agree, this is mostly rhetoric, I cannot find the meaning in most of this. Worse, I think you're stepping over the line marc9000, there is no need to attack Duo's character.\n \n \nIsn't the basic of Atheism the belief that there is no god? That opposes other religions, and announces that humans are the highest possible being. Atheism worships science, largely without proof of course.\n \n\n notes:\n 1. false always contradicts truth, no surprise here. Yes, something based on evidence, rationally justified, will often oppose something that is not.\n 2. Atheism has nothing to do with declaring anything about \"highest possible beings\". It simply is without belief in gods and godesses (mythology). That is indeed a fallacy, but since you don't like to call it that, call it being incorrect.\n 3. Atheism, once again, does not imply any view for or against science, it is again, simply, without belief in god. Science is completely capable of defending it's own position. Perhaps we should ask hospitals to require patience to fill out a form that says \"I agree science is good and it works better than prayer\". Else, they don't treat you.\n \n \n \nAtheists attempt to oppose laws based on religion, relying on what they believe their own superior intellect - human worship, a religion.\n\n \n Atheists attempt to oppose laws, at least form my perspective, when they do not make sense, or violate the constitution, or any number of reasons any American might oppose a law. If you mean to say that religious reasons for or against laws are somehow good, or better, than reasons backed by evidence and justification, I think you're incorrect.\n \n \n \nIt just states that if you're not an atheist, you're wrong and stupid. Nothing egotistical about that LOL.\n Calling someone stupid on the forums isn't tolerated. While you might be demonstrating christian values, if those christian values you exhibit break forum rules, you still break the rules. You know, those human derived things we call rules and laws?\n \n \n \nIf it opposes a form of government with it's ideas, it is a form of government. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n So when someone says \"I don't think we should have gone to war in Iraq\", they just referenced a \"form\" of government? What possible sense does this make, and how could it possibly be relevant?\n \n \nCommunism and atheism have never existed in the same government before?\n ?? What possible relevance does this statement have?\n \n \n \nThis is the fallacy of \"argument by emotive language\". (appeal to the people) Using emotionally loaded words to sway the audience's sentiments instead of their minds. It works well for you, but the more your anger, spite, and condescension is exposed to the same group of people, the less effective it will become.\n\n \n You are labeling Duo, with negative terms. Again, this isn't really consistent with forum rules. If you'd like to degrade his ARGUMENT, then go ahead. If you want to degrade him personally...you need to take a deep breath, make the sign of the cross, and cease.

   "Last month. The subcommittee is currently in session. It is a second try by Kansas creationists to remove evolution and any reference to an old earth or an old universe from the science curriculum.\n\n \n Thank you for the clarification. I'd call that current, all right. :) \n \n\n What I cited shows history of creationists to impose their religion on everyone under the guise of science.\n\n I read several of the summaries and most are only tangentially relevant.\n \n\n But you can always count on Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas to be pretty weak when it comes to defending 1st Amendment rights to freedom of religion. For example, in Santa Fe Indepentant School District v. Doe (000 U.S. 99-62 (2000)) Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas thought that it was OK for a Christian prayer to be recited as a part of the procedings of an official school function. The other 6 Justices thought not. They thought that the actions of the school district violated both freedom of religion clauses.\n I once mentioned to a lawyer that I thought Scalia was a XXXXX. He was puzzled and said that he thought that Scalia was actually one of the better Justices - smart, centered, and rational. I referred him to some dissents that Scalia had written in freedom of religion cases. He was shocked. He couldn't believe the muddled thinking that characterized those dissents. Scalia is a bit of a Jekyll & Hyde - efficient, smart, and logical in most cases but a raving monster whenever the question is if christians should be allowed to impose their religion on all by law.\n \n \n\n I think that the SCOTUS has become overly concerned in social engineering goals and less interested in Constitutionality.\n It's no wonder that major battles are brewing in Congress over the appointment of future judges. We can no longer depend on judges to act constitutionally.\n I'll give you two quick examples to illustrate my point.\n 1. The \"Establishment Clause\" says that Congress shall make no laws.......yada, yada... The 10th Amendment says that all powers not granted to Congress......yadda, yadda. A strict Constitutional interpretation would be that the above school district is free to do as it pleases since \"it\", the school district, isn't Congress and therefore the Establishment Clause doesn't pertain to it, period. End of discussion.\n 2. The recent ban on juvenile executions was viciously attacked by Scalia in his dissent, and rightfully so, IMO, as the SCOTUS putting International Law above the US Constitution. This SCOTUS ruling should scare the Hell out of any Constitution-loving American because it demonstrated the total lack of regard for State Rights, the Constitution and American sovereignty. I invite everyone to read Scalia's dissenting opinion when they get a chance.\n For your ease, it can be found on p64 of the following reference:\n http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01mar20051300/www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/04pdf/03-633.pdf\n \n\n Judge Moore's appeal to the Supreme Court was denied cert by the Supreme Court. In effect that means that the Supreme Court is saying that there are no new constitutional issues to be decided and that the Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. District Court were correct in their decisions. However, votes for cert by the Supreme Court aren't recorded but you can just bet that Moore was denied cert by a vote of 6-3. Guess who spoke out since then.\n\n \n I'm hoping that it was Scalia. He has demonstrated, IMO, a firm grasp of what it means to follow the Constitution as written, not as one wished it had been written like the clowns, Ginsburg, Kennedy and Stevens. :xcensored",

I couldn't tell. \n \n Ah, a spelling attacker. Yes, interesting. Please, explain to me how competency is directly related to spelling. After all, there could be a huge (here is where I open a can of whoop *** on you and then you go away) number of controllable or uncontrollable causes for poor spelling. For instance, how do you know that perhaps someone has rewired my keyboard so that a few letters no longer correspond to their keys? Would that be my fault? Would my competence in simply typing normally be at fault for someone else's devious act? Or perhaps I am running my post through a horrible translator that replaces letters, is that my fault? Or let's consider the fact that one may simply type very quickly with big fingers and hit accidental keys. Is that their fault, is their genetics their fault? is it?

I seriously doubt you can give a decent answer to any of those.\n \n Also, please explain to me how proper spelling validates or invalids a argument. I have come across many a weak spelling attacker, and every single one has failed horribly to even give a decent reason as to how spellings makes a argument correct or false, and when pushed, they either resorted to childish personal attacks, or merely pretended like it did not happen, so perhaps you can give a half baked reason to back your obviously childish claims up. \n \n You're obviously assuming that we believe you to be more mature then the average poster, yet you clearly have resorted to a very puerile pedantry act of attacking one for spelling rather then their points, which leads to a internal contradiction of not only claims but character.

   "Since when? We made no reference to any specific country as limit of our discussion. fallacy: raising the bar. We wer discussing your faulty logic that dictates if one religion other then christanity advances, then rejection of religion as a whole advances as well. \n\n \n My first response was to your post #12 with this phrase,\n \n \n \"certain officials are trying to legislate Christianity into law....\" \n\n \n You were referring to US officials and US law. You'll deny it, but you were.\n \n \n \n \nIt doesn't matter. You clearly hold the belief that if religion other then christanity advances, the rejection of religion as a whole does as well. I then gave you theological Islamic states, where Atheism is basically dead. How can advancement of Islam advance the rejection of that religion, when we have two clear examples of where your logic is not only wrong, but completely polar to the reality? \n\n \n See above. Referring to foreign countries is changing the subject.\n \n \n \n \nThen you obviously do not understand what atheism is. Atheism is the rejection of a higher power and the religion that follows such a belief. Atheism does not care WHICH religion is being supported, it is aganist all of it. \n\n \n IMO, if a group of activist atheists seeks to remove some part of Christianity from the US government, it could possibly seek the aid of a non-Christian religion, which opposes Christianity with the same intensity that atheism does. \n \n \n \n \nHow? How could atheists delight when a religion is being advanced over their views? \n\n \n If it was a non-Christian religion being advanced in the US, then it would benefit atheists. A tool of atheists is pointing out confusion, and opposition in various different religions.\n \n \n \n \nHow is that revelant? We are discussing how your logic which dicates atheism and non-christian religons go hand in hand. \n\n \n Christian and non-Christian religions completely oppose each other. Atheist activists could choose one side or the other to further their agenda.\n \n \n \n \nIt's funny watching you resort to fraud. \n \n \n \n On the contrary, I never said that, you're fabricating. You on the other hand said this: Post #44. \n \n You specifically noted that not all secular are atheistic. Therefore you must agree with me that secular systems do not always advance either. \n\n \n You keep referring to the ENTIRE SYSTEM. Not a \"law\", the word you used in post #12.\n \n \n \n \nUnless you'd like to prove that you did prove your points, I still hold the belief. Besides, you've just resorted to classic ad-hoemnin attacks instead of dealing with my arguments.\n \n You've ignored my refuations about government, the logical problems of your god, the difference between secular and atheism, atheism as a idea and application, how religion has changed, how morality has changed, the relation between the two, the history of christanity, and many others in post #46. \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=4505&page=2&pp=40\n You've failed to prove your points by failing to refute my refuations. \n\n \n Your brilliant strategy is working. You're draining me of time & patience. I'm not going back to post # 46, the one with your subject changing referrences to the NRA & puppy dogs.\n \n \n \n \nPlease don't do this. I hate to show your ignorance. \n \n \n \n How? Ad-homenin doesn't prove your wrong, I just used it to try to get you to think before making stupid posts. \n\n \n You grant yourself exemption from those rules, yet you smart off if anybody else does.\n \n \nI never moved the goalpost, in fact you just changed the limit to escape dealing with theological islamic states. Needling? Please show, and I never have failed to state, but instead hit you everwhere where you have not. Emotive language? Please show. I don't think you know what fallacies are. \n\n \n Emotive language - \"anger, spite, and condescension.\" Most of your posts drip with it.\n \n \n \n \nPlease example. You clearly agreed that secular systems are not always atheistic. I even have a quote from you. It doesn't get any cleaner then that. \n\n \n Not the entire sytem. Parts of it. Activist atheists don't attack the entire system. They attack parts of it.\n \n \n \n \nFine by me. I realize people like you won't change their minds. \n \n \n \n Considering how you made it up, I suppose it's not any more. :p \n \n \n \n How do i argue right along with atheism? I never said I believed in it, not to mention I have stated I am a neopagan, which clearly puts me out of that group. I'm merely pointing out how your argument fails on so many levels. Once again, you fail to prove such claims. \n\n \n Please explain the basic differences between atheism and neopaganism.\n \n \n \n \nActually I never called Kerry a idiot. I called him a douchebag. So, you're now technically a liar and a fabricator. \n\n \n Please explain the difference between an idiot and a douchebag. (as you use the term) \n \n \n \n \nI have a principle to honesty and intelligence, as well as historical accuracy. you obvioulsy do not. Besides, principle is irrevelant. We are seeing who has the better argument. I'm hitting you back with facts. you're making up lies. \n \n \n \n I have clearly made my position: that your argument is full of lies, fallacies, and is wrong on many levels. Essentially everything you have stated is false, and my stance is that what you have attacked is unjustly hit, therefore I support what you are attacking. It;'s amazing how you can't figure that out. Besides, am I trying to win? Or merely derail your argument? Victory is not important: showing that your argument is decietful is. The fallacy only applies when one is attempting to gain victory. That is not the case here, which further shows your lack of knowledge about fallacies. \n \n \n \n And I refuted it. You admit you brought it up. Therefore that contricits your claims that I brought it up: fallacy internal contridiction. You realize you have yet to make a fallacy stick? \n \n \n \n Again, lack of knowledge. Emotive language is a appeal to the people. i don't care about the people. Your fallacies and lies clearly show you to be a dishonest, fraudlent debator. The fallacies does not apply because the audience here is irrevelant. Again, please learn how to use fallacies before accusing people of such. \n \n \n \n Fallacy: Moving the goal post. We were never talking about the US in general. We were disussing your faulty logic. Fallacy: changing the subject. How does advancement of religion advance the rejection of religion?Internal contridiction. \n \n \n \n It doesn't matter what the stand for exactly, but their placement. Clearly that each represents either religion or atheism. The example was merely a physical example of your ludiacrious logic. again, the fallacy does not work. \n\n \n A multitude of fallacies, according to the list.\n \n \n \n \nYou mean one like this:\n http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#emotive\n\n \n That's the one, the one with the words, anger spite, and condescension in it's example.\n \n \n i dont care about the people. \n\n \n then,\n \n \nAfter all, it will help the rest of people here highlight your fraudlent acts. \n\n \n Which is it?\n \n You're getting eratic, I detect anger, especially after post#114 above. You should work on concealing it, but it's not surprising that it happens to you. People don't get angry when lies are told about them, they get angry when the truth is told about them. emoticon_xangel",

Worse, I think you're stepping over the line marc9000, there is no need to attack Duo's character. \n\n \n Hello Mach, thanks for civility - I can even still type when my jaw is on the floor. :) \n \n \n notes:\n \n1. false always contradicts truth, no surprise here. Yes, something based on evidence, rationally justified, will often oppose something that is not. \n\n \n Time proven scripture is not rationally justified?\n \n \n \n2. Atheism has nothing to do with declaring anything about \"highest possible beings\". It simply is without belief in gods and godesses \n\n \n But a highest possible being HAS to exist, doesn't it? If we can't find anything else, then we HAVE to conclude that man is. \n \n \n(mythology). That is indeed a fallacy, but since you don't like to call it that, call it being incorrect. \n\n \n Oh man, could we give the fallacy thing a rest in this post? :) \n \n \n \n3. Atheism, once again, does not imply any view for or against science, it is again, simply, without belief in god. Science is completely capable of defending it's own position. \n\n \n But atheism is not, without science.\n \n \nPerhaps we should ask hospitals to require patience to fill out a form that says \"I agree science is good and it works better than prayer\". Else, they don't treat you.\n\n \n God works through science, most Christians believe that.\n \n \n \nAtheists attempt to oppose laws, at least form my perspective, when they do not make sense, or violate the constitution, or any number of reasons any American might oppose a law. If you mean to say that religious reasons for or against laws are somehow good, or better, than reasons backed by evidence and justification, I think you're incorrect. \n\n \n I agree, but past experiences (traditions) are important parts of evidence and justification.\n \n \n \n Calling someone stupid on the forums isn't tolerated. While you might be demonstrating christian values, if those christian values you exhibit break forum rules, you still break the rules. You know, those human derived things we call rules and laws? \n\n \n I was responding to HIS use of the word \"stupid\". Read more carefully, please.\n \n \n \n \nSo when someone says \"I don't think we should have gone to war in Iraq\", they just referenced a \"form\" of government? What possible sense does this make, and how could it possibly be relevant? \n\n \n The war in Iraq is not relevent to this thread.\n \n \n ?? What possible relevance does this statement have? \n\n \n A response to one of HIS posts. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n \n \nYou are labeling Duo, with negative terms. \n\n \n I have critisized the WAY HE POSTS, nothing more. He has called me stupid, dishonest, fradulent, liar, fabricator, and labeled one of his rants \"the idiocy of marc9000. Please check it out for yourself - no need to apologize, but I wouldn't mind if you did. It would help me get my jaw off the floor. :p \n \n \n \n Again, this isn't really consistent with forum rules. If you'd like to degrade his ARGUMENT, then go ahead. If you want to degrade him personally...you need to take a deep breath, make the sign of the cross, and cease. If he's doing the same to you, ask him to stop, recall, even in non-christian land, two wrongs are two wrongs, not a right.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n Again, check out who really does the PERSONAL attacks.

Neopaganism consists of many religions outside of orthodox religions such as Islam, Christanity, or Judeasim. many pagans believe in a number of Gods, from nature to similar, but subtly different orthdox ones.

When's the last time a heart medication past FDA when it was justified by time proven scripture? Seriously, don't believe everything you read, verify the facts, look at motives, look at the source..ala any good researcher, religious or otherwise.\n \n \nBut a highest possible being HAS to exist, doesn't it? If we can't find anything else, then we HAVE to conclude that man is. \n \n Again, atheism is without belief in god. Nothing more.\n \n Regarding the ontological proof of a supreme being:\n \n Define \"highest being\"\n Define a test/game to discover who is the \"highest\".\n Test beings to see how they \"score\" vs one another.\n Declare the victor the supreme being, as defined by the above test.\n \n How about this, make it \"the person who saves the most lives\".\n \n Put God's name down on the list.\n \n Oh ****, do we count the Tsunami? Wow, that's 100K people dead by his hand? Oh wait...shoot. every single human that has died was caused by god. Oh man, how's this boy gonna win?\n \n Although I'm sure we can find a good ole doctor or researcher, who either saved lives directly, or through discovery of something like antiseptics or antibiotics, has saved actual human lives..without kiling everyone in the process.\n \n Define ANY test, based on reality, and let's see if your god shows up to take the test...\n \n Yes, by the EVIDENCE, the concept of god is meaningless, and therefore to claim a \"concept\", is the highest possible \"being\" also has no meaning :/\n \n \n \nOh man, could we give the fallacy thing a rest in this post? :) \n Oops, I said it above, I'll refrain here on out :/\n \n \nBut atheism is not, without science.\n\n I dont' understand. Atheism is having no belief in gods and godesses etc.\n It's just a label. It also has nothing to do with science.\n \n \nGod works through science, most Christians believe that.\n\n Hey look, most christians believe prayers actually work, people can be ressurected, miracles happen, all sorts of completely untrue things. The belief is completely and totally unfounded, that is, completely without any justification. Which god even? Which gods? Any godesses? It all results in irrational conclusions, unfortunately. Be content that you \"feel\" driven to better yourself by your beliefs. That's all they are, beliefs, but beliefs can have a profound effect on reality (the beliefs are part of reality). Science cannot take that away, and they don't care to. They are just looking for knowledge, to yes, better our lives. Having strong ideals can help navigate a human consciousness through this chaotic world, I do not deny you that. I don't use relgion, I use reason, that's just a personal choice. But when you start DENYING reason with RELIGION as your justification, you do us all a great injustice.\n \n \nI agree, but past experiences (traditions) are important parts of evidence and justification.\n \n No, they aren't. Historical accounts cannot be considered evidence for something that contradicts the present. That's like saying in history, Merlin the wizard at King Arthur's court use to cast spells, it's written, it's history, it's tradition, it's true..right? No, unless we can verify it today, that humans have this ability to do something that is for now, impossible, then we have to assume it was also possible then, and it was just fiction. You do realize because somethign is written, it's nothing more than some humans thoughts, placed on paper? I mean, I could write \"I'm superman\", and hand it down, generation after generation. Would 400 years from now, my progeny be compelled to believe indeed, that I was superman? Come on. Just let it go.\n \n You don't NEED evidence for your faith, by definition. It also cannot be supported by evidence. These are facts. As long as you aren't trying to deny reality to others, what you believe, and how it helps you, is your business (which you can most certainly share with others!). But if you use that belief, to try to deny something that IS rationally justified..i.e. what we observe as reality. That's when the problems start.\n \n -Mach",

   ";) \n \n \n unfortunately, \"time proven scripture\" is not, in itself, rational justification for anything. When's the last time a heart medication past FDA when it was justified by time proven scripture? Seriously, don't believe everything you read, verify the facts, look at motives, look at the source..ala any good researcher, religious or otherwise.\n\n \n When we talk about changes & modifications to government, we're talking a lot more about human nature than we are about today's technology.\n \n \nAgain, atheism is without belief in god. Nothing more. \n\n \n Unless it has an agenda.\n \n \nRegarding the ontological proof of a supreme being:\n \n Define \"highest being\" \n\n \n The being that has the intelligence to dominate the other beings around it. Many, if not all living things on Earth can be \"ranked\" in order of intelligence. Humans are no.1 - I hear dolphins come in second. But humans don't have the ability to create or destroy matter, so I have a hard time believing that humans are tops in the universe.\n \n \n \nDefine a test/game to discover who is the \"highest\".\n Test beings to see how they \"score\" vs one another.\n Declare the victor the supreme being, as defined by the above test. \n\n \n Wouldn't work, God doesn't wanna take any human tests just now. This is the age of his silence, to guard the record and the truth.\n \n \nHow about this, make it \"the person who saves the most lives\".\n \n Put God's name down on the list.\n \n Oh ****, do we count the Tsunami? Wow, that's 100K people dead by his hand? Oh wait...shoot. every single human that has died was caused by god. Oh man, how's this boy gonna win? \n\n \n Since he's the only one who can create life, he's the only one who doesn't have to seek permission to take it. We're all gonna die, eventually. Was it all that important WHEN he decided to take those people?\n \n \n \nDefine ANY test, based on reality, and let's see if your god shows up to take the test...\n \n Yes, by the EVIDENCE, the concept of god is meaningless, and therefore to claim a \"concept\", is the highest possible \"being\" also has no meaning :/ \n\n \n God desires people come to him willingly. How else could things be today, without the scales being tipped seriously one way or the other?\n \n \n \n \n \nI dont' understand. Atheism is having no belief in gods and godesses etc.\n It's just a label. It also has nothing to do with science. \n\n \n Have you ever seen the \"American Atheists\" symbol? It's a scientific symbol.\n \n \n \nHey look, most christians believe prayers actually work, people can be ressurected, miracles happen, all sorts of completely untrue things. \n\n \n Think about how complex your bod is, and ask yourself if it isn't a miracle. Why do we love - why do we hate? \n \n \nThe belief is completely and totally unfounded, that is, completely without any justification. Which god even? Which gods? Any godesses? It all results in irrational conclusions, unfortunately. Be content that you \"feel\" driven to better yourself by your beliefs. That's all they are, beliefs, but beliefs can have a profound effect on reality (the beliefs are part of reality). Science cannot take that away, and they don't care to. They are just looking for knowledge, to yes, better our lives. Having strong ideals can help navigate a human consciousness through this chaotic world, I do not deny you that. I don't use relgion, I use reason, that's just a personal choice. But when you start DENYING reason with RELIGION as your justification, you do us all a great injustice. \n\n \n But we often have a problem with WHO is doing the reasoning? Which imperfect human? Do you deny that ALL humans are imperfect?\n \n \n \nNo, they aren't. Historical accounts cannot be considered evidence for something that contradicts the present. \n\n \n Yes they are, they can show how humans reacted to a certain decision or event. Just because technology changes over generations, human nature does NOT.\n \n \nThat's like saying in history, Merlin the wizard at King Arthur's court use to cast spells, it's written, it's history, it's tradition, it's true..right? No, unless we can verify it today, that humans have this ability to do something that is for now, impossible, then we have to assume it was also possible then, and it was just fiction. You do realize because somethign is written, it's nothing more than some humans thoughts, placed on paper? I mean, I could write \"I'm superman\", and hand it down, generation after generation. Would 400 years from now, my progeny be compelled to believe indeed, that I was superman? Come on. Just let it go. \n\n \n Christians believe the Bible is special in that regard. You have to admit it's been pretty carefully preserved over the ages, hasn't it?\n \n \nYou don't NEED evidence for your faith, by definition. It also cannot be supported by evidence. These are facts. As long as you aren't trying to deny reality to others, what you believe, and how it helps you, is your business (which you can most certainly share with others!). But if you use that belief, to try to deny something that IS rationally justified..i.e. what we observe as reality. That's when the problems start.\n \n -Mach\n\n \n WHO seeks to rationally justify it - A HUMAN. What does that human have to gain from some sort of change? That's also where the problems start.",

   "when it comes down to time honored texts that have been carefully preserved, i like to point to the Mahabharatha. It is considered the longest epic ever written, spanning thousands of verses in 18 volumes. It is also extremely well preserved; it's error rate (in comparison to the original) is said to be so little that there are but a few words in question. The epic is also written as history. It is based on two rival monarchies, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, and their 14+ years of bitter struggle which ends with a final 18 war.\n \n By all accounts, this book has the same credibility of time honored text as any religious text. But examination of its content reveal \"occurances\" not feasable in the time of its writing (5000BC, which makes it older that even the bible). There are instances of flying aircrafts, explosive missles, biological warfare capable of putting to sleep thousands of soldiers, and even force fields. Does it's honor of age give it enough credibility to be accounted as History?\n \n There is no doubt that there was some major war. In fact, the war might have been very similar to the one described in the Mahabharata. There is a lot of proof to its truth, such as a well documented family tree from which even descendants today can refer too. Just like the Bible, the Mahabharata has many proofs and facts to verify its claims. However, its plot line, though it has a possibility of occuring today, is very unlikely of happening in the period it was written.\n \n [edit] The time of writing in only about 200 B.C.

The problem that many people have in defining it as fiction or non-fiction is that while it's basically true (many of the people in the story have been proven to exist, the Bharata empire really did exist, and so on), there are so many things that occur throughout the epic that make it hard to believe (flying ships for the most part).\n \n The greatest contribution of the Mahabharata is the Bhagavad Gita, a compressed version of the Vedas.\n \n And you guessed right on its origen. It is Indian.\n \n If you dare to read the whole thing (it's proposterously long) you can go here:\n http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/maha/\n It is a complete english translation of the entire piece, and has been slightly altered so that it may be written in prose instead of poetry.\n \n But the example of the Mahabharata is just an example. Another example is the Zoroastrian Zend-Avesta (can be found at http://www.avesta.org/avesta.html). Similarily to the Bible, this book is time-honored (constructed around 1400 BC).

Can we test this to see if it's true or is it \"beyond testing\", that is, completely fictional?\n\n \n I was told that by an older-than-dirt Bible Scholar, who taught the Greek language. (original language of the New Testament) I trust him - you trust atheist scientests. Guess we're even. :) \n \n \n \n \nProof please of some \"concept\" creating life. There is none, it's a false statement. How do you know what your fictional concept of god can and can't do? IS there a rule book to his code of conduct? Come on, people die, and other people help save lives. Which side are you on?\n \n \n \n Scales? What scales? \n\n \n Tipping the scales, giving either Christians or non Christians absolute proof that he does or does not exist. Showing himself would turn us all into subjects, not willing believers. God can hang any facade in front of scientests that he wants.\n \n \nDesires? God \"Desires\"? This makes absoultely no sense. \n\n \n It make no sense only to someone who has never opened a Bible in their life. \n \n \n \n \nAnd?\n\n \n That was in response to your claim that science & atheism have nothing to do with each other. You're now proving very clearly that they do.\n \n \n\n Define perfect. If a human CAN be perfect, than a human somewhere, at some time, is probable perfect. If a human cannot be logically perfect, then it would be illogical to suggest a human IS perfect. So what's your point? \n\n \n My point is that it's a no brainer to see that no one is perfect. (my belief is that only one person was)\n \n \n \n \nSure it does, read more books. Read more books. books = good. knowledge = good. Humans helping humans = good. humans worshiping (nothing) = waste of time. \n\n \n You place a lot of trust in men. \n \n \n \nSo has dinosaur droppings. \n\n \n Dinosaur dropping are special? Or preserved? Who has them? emoticon_xclown \n \n \n \n \nWhat are you talking about? Facts man. Find out what's true, sift through evidence, share the knowledge, better our lives on earth. \n\n \n I'm talking about human rulers. I haven't found a perfect one yet. You should consider not comparing God to them.",
