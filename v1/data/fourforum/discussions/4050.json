They claim that Genesis is an allegory (like John Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress\") - in other words a narrative that is meant to be understood symbolically.\n\n there are many problems with taking the genesis story as figurative rather than literally. i've raised them often in other threads without getting any adequate feedback. here are the main ones as i see them\n \n 1. Genesis not only answers the question \"how come existence\", it also establishes the principle of original sin, which all of mankind is afflicted with, and the supernatural power of God, the only type of power that can rectify the problem of sin. if there is no sin and/or no supernatural power of God, then there is no validity in christianity\n \n 2. Genesis sets the standard for the entire bible. the bible itself is deemed as completely 100% true. christianity is based entirely upon the principle and accounts written in the bible. if the book of Genesis is found to be not a true account of an actual event, then what in the bible is? was also the flood figurative? the red sea? the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus himself? if you view the bible as a figurative work, then where does it become actual, if ever? and if nothing in the bible is based on fact, then there is no validity in christianity\n \n 3. Genesis holds within it the foundation of the nation of israel, a people that actually exist. the lineage of Abraham can be traced back to adam in genesis. ancestry is not something taken lightly by these people. they go through great lengths to preserve the family histories. if the characters in genesis never existed, then how far down the line does the make-believe stop and the actual names begin? did abraham actually exist? did the people mentioned before him exist? what parts of the character descriptions are real and which are not?\n \n 4. if genesis is indeed to be taken figuratively, what is the message we are supposed to derive? what is the moral of the story? what is it supposed to represent? this is the most frustrating problem with taking genesis figurately. noone can say what the lesson of the fable is! \n \n i know there are people out there that accept evolution, yet maintain that the christian religion is valid. i would really like to hear the views of people that understand evolution and christianity and can accept both. i have no intention of ridiculing anyone, but i am just interested in seeing how such a position can work",

Could Adam and Eve see through their eyelids?\n \n Then:\n \n 6 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. \n \n Hmm, so they didn't die. their eyes were opened. They could see, where before they had to go around by touch, but it said the fruit was pleasing to the eye. They must have rubbed it on their eyelids.\n \n So, they didn't die. So that means God lied and the serpent told the truth.\n Oh, but they died spiritually, you know, they didn't LITERALLY die!\n \n \n Edit: (ok, different computer)\n \n \n Chapter 6:\n \n 1And it cometh to pass that mankind have begun to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters have been born to them,\n 2and sons of God see the daughters of men that they [are] fair, and they take to themselves women of all whom they have chosen.\n 3And Jehovah saith, `My Spirit doth not strive in man -- to the age; in their erring they [are] flesh:' and his days have been an hundred and twenty years.\n 4The fallen ones were in the earth in those days, and even afterwards when sons of God come in unto daughters of men, and they have borne to them -- they [are] the heroes, who, from of old, [are] the men of name.\n \n So men had daughters but God had sons, and then they met up and got married. I don't even know what to make of the 120 years statement. Does this mean that human lives will be limited to 120 years? Or is it one nameless man whose life he cut short at 120 years old?\n \n 6and Jehovah repenteth that He hath made man in the earth, and He grieveth Himself -- unto His heart.\n \n Jehovah had regrets? Does this mean he made a mistake?\n \n Uh oh, now we're getting into Noah territory:\n \n 19and of all that liveth, of all flesh, two of every [sort] thou dost bring in unto the ark, to keep alive with thee; male and female are they.\n \n of ALL that liveth, male and female. Well, somethings that liveth don't have male and female, and everyone knows the problem with fitting 2 of every kind of the millions of kinds that live, and the billions of kinds that ever were.\n \n \n 11and the dove cometh in unto him at even-time, and lo, an olive leaf torn off in her mouth; and Noah knoweth that the waters have been lightened from off the earth.\n \n So the instant the salty/brakish waters of the flood subsided that had killed every living thing on earth, an olive tree INSTANTLY sprang up. Or at least it did it very quickly.\n \n 3Every creeping thing that is alive, to you it is for food; as the green herb I have given to you the whole;\n \n I know that I can't eat every single creeping thing and live, can you?\n But, it is our food, whether it kills us or not, well....\n \n Well, that was from Young's Literal Translation, the NIV spells it out better:\n \n 3 Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.\n \n Yup, we can eat anything that lives and moves! Mmm, botulism.\n \n Then we come upon the contradiction revealed earlier to me:\n \n Chapter 10:\n 5 (From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.) The Hamites\n 20 These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. The Semites\n 31 These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.\n \n Chapter 11:\n 1 Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.\n \n Doh!\n \n \n Anyway, this could go on and on.....",

Well, this can be true with pretty much any interpretation of Christianity, because Christianity is not founded on the physical reality of this earth, but rather on a spiritual world.

The world came into existence. (Doesn't matter exactly how or when... just that it did. And God caused it to happen.) Humanity came into existence. (Again -- by the power of God.) Humanity (or some part of humanity) did something that for some reason displeased God that had an impact on all of their descendants. The act of displeasing God became known as sin. Since all their descendants are impacted by whatever the first perpetrators did, all their descendents have -- by default -- displeased God. And having this 'stain of original sin,' it makes those descendants more prone to displease God in other ways. \n \n We don't necessarily know specifically what this 'original sin' was -- only that it happened. The penalty for displeasing God is spiritual death -- a life without God. But God had a plan from the beginning... God knew that humanity (or some part of it) would displease God.

The explanation above accounts for the basic truths that can be considered to be conveyed by the story in Genesis. (i.e. God created the earth, created humanity, humanity displeased God and suffered the consequences of original sin.) The concepts of the story can be considered to be true without the specific details of a particular version of the story considered literally true.\n \n 3) It can be considered unimportant whether specific biblical characters existed in the physical history of this earth or not. The idea behind the lineages could be to show that these people can be traced back to God. That can be considered to be true -- even if the specific individuals listed are only figurative characters designed to make a point or two.\n \n 4) The story of Genesis can be considered to convey the ideas that God created the earth and everything in it; that humanity has displeased God and continues to do so; that God had motivation to save us from our sins, and that he ultimately accomplished this through the sacrifice of Jesus; that God loves us; that we should strive to please God.\n \n Personally, I would be very interested to hear the perspective of Maximus on this issue.

Takers use the environment as if it were made specifically for them with little or no regard for other life (as if they were gods that could control destiny).

The world came into existence. (Doesn't matter exactly how or when... just that it did. And God caused it to happen.) Humanity came into existence. (Again -- by the power of God.)

Since all their descendants are impacted by whatever the first perpetrators did, all their descendents have -- by default -- displeased God. And having this 'stain of original sin,' it makes those descendants more prone to displease God in other ways. \n\n ok, the first problem arises in \"God caused it to happen\". the problem is that we have in genesis 2 chapters dedicated to explaining how God miraculously created the world, and now the realization that it could have just been \"God created everything. when he created man, manwas perfect, but somewhere along the line man messed up and became imperfect\". according to your explanation, this would be closer to the truth, but it would be terribly inadequate. why would genesis be included in the bible at all if it is so far fro the truth?\n \n second problem is that we cannot realistically assume that all humans came down the line of adam if adam wasnt the only (or first) man on earth at the time. the rest of the world population would have continued to procreate, breeding untainted humans that would (and should) be more numerous than the descendants of adam. if this is the case, then \"original sin\" and therefore \"redemption\" need not apply to all of the world's population, but only those under adam's direct lineage (whoever those unfortunate people are)\n \n \nWe don't necessarily know specifically what this 'original sin' was -- only that it happened. The penalty for displeasing God is spiritual death -- a life without God. But God had a plan from the beginning... God knew that humanity (or some part of it) would displease God. So God gave us Jesus to die in place of us so that we could live forever with God.\n\n this, in concept, makes sense, but it wont hold if the foundation it is based on is invalid to begin with. by not identifying this original sin, how do we correctly identify the remedy?\n \n \nIn response to your four outlined problems from post #4...\n 1) The above explanation accounts for original sin, and God's supernatural plan to save humanity from all sin.\n\n it doesnt demonstrate that God has limitless supernatural power to influence physical reality. this is a very important belief in christianity. in fact, the belief that God can do all things possible in the physical (as well s spiritual) realm is what makes everything else in the bible believable. without that, the supernatural events described in the bible are nothing but either exagerrations or myths entirely\n \n \n2) The bible need not be understood 100% literally for it to be considered true. The explanation above accounts for the basic truths that can be considered to be conveyed by the story in Genesis. (i.e. God created the earth, created humanity, humanity displeased God and suffered the consequences of original sin.) The concepts of the story can be considered to be true without the specific details of a particular version of the story considered literally true.\n\n a partially true bible opens itself to selective application. a bible full of myths cannot be relied upon as a source of truth about history or the future\n \n \n3) It can be considered unimportant whether specific biblical characters existed in the physical history of this earth or not. The idea behind the lineages could be to show that these people can be traced back to God. That can be considered to be true -- even if the specific individuals listed are only figurative characters designed to make a point or two.\n\n if the characters are made up, then again the bible is constitued of fictional work, whose events cannot be used in real-life application. for example, the fictional character noah that built a boat under the command of God, reveals to me that God doesnt actually command people to do the outlandish or illogical. if the story os only make-belief, then it is unreasonable to demand that i apply the example of these characters to my life. christianity heavily relies on the application of these characters' deeds to real life\n \n \n4) The story of Genesis can be considered to convey the ideas that God created the earth and everything in it; that humanity has displeased God and continues to do so; that God had motivation to save us from our sins, and that he ultimately accomplished this through the sacrifice of Jesus; that God loves us; that we should strive to please God.\n\n as genesis is not based upon reality, none of these ideas are necessarily applicable to real-life. we can have a fictional character do absolutely anything (including creating a round square). yet such rules dont apply to reality, and cannot be expected to be actually followed\n \n \nPersonally, I would be very interested to hear the perspective of Maximus on this issue.

Leavers, on the other hand, live as if they are a part of the cycle of life (which every living thing on this planet is).\n\n i see. however i still disagree that the parallel can be made as a comparison of cain and abel. in the story, abel was never described as a \"leaver\". abel would take the animals most likely to survive and produce the best offspring, and kill them, upsetting the laws of natural selection. yet he was the one favored by God. i see no similarity in the cain and abel episode and the war between the \"takers\" and \"leavers\"",

   "I've heard arguments from Christians on both sides of this. \"Free interpretationists\" claim that since Jesus liked parables (i.e. figurative stories) a lot, then the Bible must be read figuratively, for the Bible itself may be a parable. Fundamentalists counter this by claiming that since human beings are falliable, then interpreting the Bible figuratively allows too much room for human error. In effect, they say, \"If you interpret the Bible figuratively, you might as well be thinking freely.\"\n \n It's bend or break. The former position allows the Christian doctrine to be bent by reason. The latter allows the Christian doctrine to be broken by reason.\n\n lol, well if the bible is to be taken figuratively, what make you think jesus actually liked parables? (i dont mean \"you\" dzeron specifically)\n \n i dont believe any bending is involved. its either leave as is, or break. i cant see how the bible, or the absoluteness of christian doctrine, can allow for flexibility",

   "The advantage of an allegorical interpretation (of the Bible) is that it can \"mean\" more or less whatever you want it to mean: interpretation is all. \n Sometimes a \"key\" may be available so that when x is mentioned (in an allegory), you know that it signifies y. Many Christians resort to this sort of explanation for the scriptures - especially for Old Testament narratives.\n \n A Christian man of science who accepts evolution, the Big Bang, Einstein's relativity, etc., has these options:\n 1. He hangs on to his science and rejects the Genesis account of creation as a myth: in which case his religious commitment is compromised.\n 2. He hangs on to his science and interprets Genesis in a figurative sense; in which case he can feel comfortable with a foot in both camps.\n 3. The third alternative - that he hangs on to his science and believes that Genesis is a literal account of creation; in which case he ends up in an absurd and intolerable position.\n \n Is it any surprise that number 2 is the favored option ?\n\n well stated. (i have some views on this, but i'll reserve them for later) the purpose of this thread is to invite those that fit the option 2 category (or any of the categories for that matter)",

   "I think that Catholics have always taken the story of the Fall literally enough to be history but figuratively enough to be allegory. I think it could be an entirely literal account. But I do not discount that it could be a figurative story steeped in essential, non-negotiable truths. It is like the other Christian mysteries that we know much about but not everything. There are two points of the story that must be taken as certainties: the fall was a fall and the infusion of a soul by God was not an evolution (even if there was an evolution of the body).\n \n One who cannot understand the truths of the Creation and Fall story of Eden cannot understand the truths of the Incarnation, Crucifixion, and Resurrection of the Gospels. The parallels between the two are striking. The Church Fathers wrote about this. Jesus is the new and perfected Adam. Mary is the new and perfected Eve. \n \n The disobedience of the woman of Eve was undone by the obedience of the woman Mary (St. Irenaeus).\n \n Eve brought death into the world as Mary brought life into the world (St. Jerome).\n \n Eve was the mother of all mankind as Mary is the Mother of the Church. \n \n In the Garden of Eden, man was created in the image of God. In the Incarnation, God's image actually became man. \n \n The Fall of Man took place in a garden just as the Redemption of Man did at the crucifixion/resurrection. (John Chapter 19) \n \n In the Garden of Eden, death was instituted at the Tree of Life. At the Crucifixion, life was restored on a tree of death. \n \n Adam was the word for \"man.\" Jesus often referred to himself as the \"Son of Man.\" Sin and death came into the world through one man and grace/everlasting life came into the world through one man. (Romans 5:12, 17)\n \n God breathed life into Adam. A resurrected Jesus breathed the eternal life of the Holy Spirit into the apostles. (John 20)\n \n As I wrote earlier, from the viewpoint of the Christian, the Fall  must be a fall. It must be a fall from a higher state, one that was closer to divinity. If, in Christianity, God is a perfect being, the standard of justice, then his creations would have been perfect. The actions of his creations would have been sinless. The union of God and man would have been totally upright and moral. It is very evident that this relationship has been damaged. It is a fact that \"sin\" exists. The wrench in the system was free will. \n \n As Chesterton wrote it, \"Certain new theologians dispute original sin, which is the only part of Christian theology which can really be proved.\"* \"The first fact is the fact that original sin is really original. Not merely in theology but in history it is a thing rooted in the origins. Whatever else men have believed, they have all believed that there is something the matter with mankind. This sense of sin has made it impossible to be natural and have no clothes, just as it has made it impossible to be natural and have no laws.\"** \n \n But it is not outside of the capability of God to have worked through evolution. \"God could have infused a soul into an already existing being, having previously prepared a body to suit it, making it a 'man'.\"*** \n \n Advances in the sciences \"lead one no longer to regard the theory of evolution as a mere hypothesis.\"**** But there are many theories of evolution. Some are contrary to the Christian faith. \"The theories of evolution which, in line with the philosophies which inspire them, regard the spirit as something that emerges from the forces of living matter or as a mere epiphenomenon of that matter, are incompatible with the truth about man\"**** To paraphrase with Chesterton's words, \"Nature is not our mother, she is our sister.\" \n \n Although a possibility or probability, evolution is not a thorough explanation of the Christian view of man. The mind and soul of man are fatal flaws of a completely evolutionary theory. Free will is another breaking point because there is only fate or natural selection or randomness in evolution. Evolution is not even a full explanation of the scientific view of man. \"... evolution really is mistaken for explanation. It has the fatal quality of leaving on many minds the impression that they do understand it and everything else; just as many of them live under a sort of illusion that they have read the Origin of Species. But this notion of something smooth and slow, like the ascent of a slope, is a great part of the illusion. It is an illogicality as well as an illusion; for slowness has really nothing to do with the question. An event is not any more intrinsically intelligible or unintelligible because of the pace at which it moves. For a man who does not believe in a miracle, a slow miracle would be just as incredible as a swift one.\"**\n \n \"The sincerity of Darwin really admitted this; and that is how we came to use such a term as the Missing Link. But the dogmatism of Darwinians has been too strong for the agnosticism of Darwin; and men have insensibly fallen into turning this entirely negative term into a positive image. They talk of searching for the habits and habitat of the Missing Link; as if one were to talk of being on friendly terms with the gap in a narrative or the hole in an argument, of taking a walk with a non-sequitir or dining with an undistributed middle...I shall waste no further space on these speculations on the nature of man before he became man. His body may have been evolved from the brutes; but we know nothing of any such transition that throws the smallest light upon his soul as it has shown itself in history.\"**\n \n \"There may be a broken trail of stones and bones faintly suggesting the development of the human body. There is nothing even faintly suggesting such a development of the human mind. It was not and it was; we know not in what instant or infinity of years. Something happened; and it has all the appearance of a transaction outside time.\"**\n \n \"Whether or no the garden was an allegory, the truth itself can be very well allegorized as a garden. And the point of it is that Man, whatever else he is, is certainly not merely one of the plants of the garden that has plucked its roots out of the soil and walked about with them like legs...He is something else, something strange and solitary.\"***** \n \n *Orthodoxy G.K. Chesterton\n **The Everlasting Man  G.K. Chesterton\n ***The Pentateuch Navarre Study Bible\n ****Pope John Paul II message to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences October 1996\n *****The Thing  G.K.

   "I think original sin was made up to solve the problem of the 'need' for salvation, at least in the eyes of Saint Augustine, who seems to have misinterpreted many of Pauls writings.\n \n The Jewish concept of 'the urge to do good', and the 'urge to do evil' and the description of original sin as being sin only in an analogy sense as described in the Cathesism of the Roman Catholic church make much more sense that the original sin concept that many of the Protestants believe in.\n\n i read your link to augustine's article on the other thread. (frankly, i'm surprised the church turned augustine into an authority on doctrine, rather than regarded him as a serious crackpot and gave him the historical boot. this guy is way left field from what ive seen.) if there is no need for salvation, then what is the church doing? how could the church perpetuate that God exists in reality, if there is no such thing as original sin in reality?\n \nThat is a tough viewpoint to take.
