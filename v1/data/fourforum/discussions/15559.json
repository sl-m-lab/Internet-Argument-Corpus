How do you presume the power over a business to go where it will?\n\n \n Exxon Mobil registered an average 17.6 percent federal effective corporate tax rate on its annual earnings in the three years spanning 2008 to 2010. \n \n That's about Half of what other corporations are paying.. And not anywhere close to your 47% . \n \n Individuals in the highest quintile pay an average tax rate just over 25 percent in the United States. Exxon Mobil, meanwhile, paid approximately the same effective tax rate as Americans in the fourth income quintile-which includes Americans earning from $62,000 to $100,000 a year.\n Exxon Mobil's accounting methods mask its relatively low effective tax rate. According to CNN Money the $3.1 billion in taxes the company claims to have paid since January 2011 includes both federal and state gasoline taxes-that are really paid by drivers-as well as employee payroll taxes.\n \n So they are basically claiming taxes that they don't pay to pad their numbers so that people will believe they are paying taxes when in fact they are not . The part I find most appalling is that we don't even have to raise the tax rates or corporate taxes to increase the revenues. All we need to do is eliminate all the loopholes which allow these big corporations to get away without paying taxes.

   "That's because you did not include the sales taxes or foreign taxes which you will note I referenced in my 47% figure. earlier you said:\n\n \n Funny. So let me see if I understand this correctly. In your number you count sales tax which is an end use tax so if they pay sales tax its because they bought something which is the same as everybody else in the US subject to a use tax. Are you suggesting that in addition to being able to expense the purchase they should get an additional break on the sales tax? They already get the deduction why should they get even more?\n \n Your kidding? We are supposed to help finance operations in every country a US business is active? Paying foreign taxes is not our problem. Are they smart enough to only factor taxes into pricing in the US? You claim any tax burden will only be passed on to the consumer, yet you would like help ease that cost on foreign consumers as well. \n \n Considering many states give credit for taxes paid to other states (no not all and not on all income) and both state and fed allow deductions for just about everything if not immediately then with the exception of a few specific types of assets within a few years. So in other words everything is a deduction. \n \n Throwing individual states tax laws into the argument is not what the Fed is talking about when it comes to Oil companies and is far to complicated to try and debate.\n \n \nWe already know Corporations don't pay taxes, that's what the problem is.\n 47% total taxes: Federal, State, and Foreign. Mark it zero dude, next frame.\n\n \n Try counting before the pins are reset. Its more accurate\n \n \nComparing multinational corporate taxes paid in one nation to individual income is clearly an apples to oranges argument.\n \n But they still pay those taxes just as any other company that pays federal or state taxes does BEFORE passing them on to the consumer. This is a legitimate expense for the industry to claim an there is nothing untoward in doing so. See, that's the problem with corporate taxes. They get passed on to the consumer in ALL industries and yet those companies can claim them as deductions.\n \n \n \n No the specific breaks that are at issue are for the most part pertinate only to the oil industry. Two of them come from a completly different economic environment. One of them makes it possible to receive a larger credit than what should be and one is easily manipulated and the purpose for which it was enacted hasn't really been helped by it.\n \n \nThis is not accurate because tax benefit does not equal tax refund. I refer you to the not terribly right-leaning Washington Post:\n \n The truth about GE&rsquo;s tax bill - The Washington Post\n GE's 2010 financial statements reported a $3.25 billion U.S. \"current tax benefit,\" which is where the Times, which declined to comment, got its $3.2 billion \"tax benefit\" number.

The number is unlikely to be disclosed unless GE goes public with it or is forced to do so.\n\n \n This is a shell game or semantics. The tax benefit is exactly that a benefit. By saying they got a benefit of 3.2 billion means they benefited by that amount. Maybe they still had a liability after that benefit, but you want to get stuck on what they paid and pretend since there was a liability there is no need to discuss anything else? \n \n If you look at corporate payments as a % of revenue collected by the IRS its around 20% and that doesn't include refunds. What we are losing sight of is the 2nd purpose of taxes is to influence behavior. That is what the breaks, credits and added tax are for. There is no \"right\" corps have to those factors. Government cannot look to the general well being of the population if it is afraid to act or acts in a manner beneficial to a small representative group within the society.\n \n I don't blame corps for structuring their business to their advantage based on existing tax law, but I also don't have a lot of sympathy when that tax law is changed for good reason. Our political system is currently headed in the wrong direction when it comes to an equal playing field with respect to the ability to influence law makers. Corps have an advantage and I don't think it a good idea to wait until they shoot themselves in foot to do something about it.\n \n Why isn't government regulations part of the risk business takes that earns them their profit. The US is one of the most stable tax and regulatory nations, it may have greater restrictions but they don't change overnight and there is always something to make it much easier than it could have been.",

The article I use is dealing with the company's tax liability, their actual tax liability, how they arrived at it, how it effected net income and how it was reported both pre and post tax. In the context of the article and my post \"benefit\" may not translate dollar for dollar, but it does impact the actual taxes and rate paid and profit subject to distribution to shareholders. This is the reason I specifically wanted to be clear you were saying the opposite that one had no bearing on the other. In this case that is not true. There are circumstances where it is, but this happens to not be one of them. \n \n I will take some responsibility in that the portion of the article I posted was discussing pre-tax income which would have been misleading. As I skimmed through I cut and pasted a different part than the one I intended. This was further convuluted in that the argument shifted from the oil industry to GE and corporate reporting of taxes to the IRS and shareholders.\n \n Read the article, specifically the Income Tax section taken from GE's filing for 2010.

Note 14 of their financials explains this better. There is no way this is actual tax expense. \n \n You mention the \"benefit\" does effect tax liability. This is misleading in my opinion. From what I can tell GECS is causing a tax \"benefit\" from being an international company which creates different tax laws and accounting laws. The net result is actually less than the tax benefit reported in your article. Furthermore, it is probably not in GE's best interest to make a habit of not complying with tax code and US GAAP. \n \n At GE the most likely scenario (granted I'm not looking too hard...i have a real job) is GE is using part of the tax code where if the income is outside the US you exclude it from income (since it is taxed by that country). This is basically a deferral of income tax. Combine this with probable losses by GECS and you end up with the so called \"tax benefit\". \n \n So to keep it short and simple, it basically is all reconciling items.\n \n So does the \"benefit\" impact tax expense? Yeah, kinda. Is it really a \"benefit\"? Not anymore than saying deduction of labor costs is a benefit.",
