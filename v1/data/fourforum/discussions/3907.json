A camera and a rifle are set up on a platform where one can wait for animals (particularly deer and wild pigs) and then shoot them.\n \n Anyone else think this is insanely absurd?",

No hunting to it.\n And what about other countries, unregulated, opening these up? You could shoot a lion in Africa for a few thousand, email your kill to some poor guy on standby there, then point, click and kill in some other exotic place. Can't pass up that kind of money, now can they? \n \n These guys could open a franchise...Whoopeeee~~!\n \n On the other hand, this would be a very interesting legal situation if someone wandered into that area and was shot. With all of the identity theft, could you prove who did the shooting? Maybe - but who is liable? \n \n Might work for Usama Bin Laden..................... \n \n Hmmm.. I wonder if there would be a black market where they would setup mobile wireless ranges in the woods? \n \n Watch out hikers!!!\n \n Here, on the Texas, Parks, and Wildlife Home Page they are going to be taking public comment via internet on this subject and all the other new regulations and proposals starting March1st and going till April6th.

Here in Kansas hunters are required to go through hunter safety classes before they are allowed to hunt.

How could anyone possibly have a feel for the environment that they are shooting into, if they are not there to observe the surroundings? I have a feeling something like this will get put down before it really gets started, at least I hope so. Like Orn said, just more fuel for the anti crowd, and who could blame them on this one.",
