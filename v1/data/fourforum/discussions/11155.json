And yet, you and others direct your rage at me.\n \nHeck, the only sort of person for which this wouldn't be hypocritical--by the standards you're applying--is someone who would proudly do those horrible actions and not see anything wrong with them.\nRight.

It isn't like he professed to have higher morals just because he claimed to be a christian.\n \nI think most of the time, when people (not just Christians--ANYONE) do bad things, they do it despite knowing it's wrong.\nSo, \"Oh, well. Just another sinner.\" My bet is you were a lot more critical of the pedophile scandal in the Catholic Church. I know that thousands left the Catholic Church because of that. They were angry. It wasn't just a matter of \"Oh, well. Just a few sinners.\"\n \nAnd so it's almost always hypocritical when people do bad things.\nBut there are degrees. And when it hits closer to home, you don't seem to take it very seriously. Sorry, but I have higher morals than that.\n \nIf this guy had gone around preaching and teaching that soliciting sex is wrong, it might make him more hypocritical, but the only thing you seem to be pointing to here is that he is probably a Christian. That doesn't really make it any more hypocritical than otherwise.\nIt does too. He claimed to be a christian educator. His assumed leadership adds to his hypocrisy. By offering a christian education he was claiming to be somehow special. Either non-christians should not expect more from those who claim to be christians, or they should expect the same behavior as from anyone else. You are claiming the latter, that christians are in no way special. So the next time some christian claims to have a higher calling and higher morals than an atheist or agnostic, can I refer them to you? You can tell them that christians are just as dirty, sinful and perverted as anyone else.\n \n But sure, he was being hypocritical to SOME degree. (Most people are.)\nOh, well. Even christian leaders lead the wrong direction.\n \nNevertheless, the actions of this man have nothing to do with most Christians.\nOnce again. What was you opinion of the Catholic Church scandal?

Even though the incident didn't have anything to do with most christians, many took the opportunity to regale the Catholic Church with outrage. They were just sinners, you know.\n \n Also, FWIW, no one here is 'angry' at you or anyone else.\nI notice that you and others immediately justified the actions of this man by bringing up the Catholic Church. Oh, well. Just another sinner. We should expect this of christians because they are no better than others and don't claim to be. Is that right?\n \nWe're just discussing this issue that you brought up. But this is a common tactic I see here where people post stories they read or see about a supposed Christian doing something bad in order to insinuate something about Christians in general.\nHow's that? Just a news story. We all know that we shouldn't expect more from christian leaders.\n \nThe only person this addresses is the person who did it--most Christians in fact don't solicit sex from underage teenagers.\nAnd therefore most christians shouldn't be concerned about this, is that it? Or is it that most christians actually expect this from their leaders? Why aren't christians concerned. Why the anger at me? (read the thread. I also got real rage from christians on other boards to the extent that two were warned). Why aren't christians appalled at this man's actions?",

   "You're welcome. I am amazed at how christians seem to think that this is no big deal. This is a man who claims to be a christian educator and yet christians on this board and others just have your \"oh, well\" attitude. And yet, you and others direct your rage at me.\n\n \n Who said 'it's no big deal'? I didn't say that. The point here is that it's really no bigger a deal because the guy was likely a Christian than it is otherwise. it's tragic no matter what background of the person committing the crime. \n \n \nRight. Thus your, \"Oh, well. He's just a christian who went astray\" attitude. It isn't like he professed to have higher morals just because he claimed to be a christian. So, \"Oh, well. Just another sinner.\" My bet is you were a lot more critical of the pedophile scandal in the Catholic Church. I know that thousands left the Catholic Church because of that. They were angry. It wasn't just a matter of \"Oh, well. Just a few sinners.\"\n\n \n I don't recall making any bigger deal over the priest scandal than it warranted, which was to say that I thought it was tragic. But why should people leave the church because some priests sinned? If a priest or minister sins, that has nothing to do with MY faith. It would be a pretty weak faith, after all, if I lost it because other Christians fail.\n \n \nBut there are degrees. And when it hits closer to home, you don't seem to take it very seriously. Sorry, but I have higher morals than that.\n\n \n What are you wanting me to do here, exactly? I've already said I think it's wrong what the man did.\n \n \nIt does too. He claimed to be a christian educator. His assumed leadership adds to his hypocrisy. By offering a christian education he was claiming to be somehow special. Either non-christians should not expect more from those who claim to be christians, or they should expect the same behavior as from anyone else. You are claiming the latter, that christians are in no way special. So the next time some christian claims to have a higher calling and higher morals than an atheist or agnostic, can I refer them to you?\n\n \n Well now, let's think about this for a second, shall we? The 'sin' in question here is that this man solicited (or blackmailed) a teenager into sexual behavior, and was willing to do that with an underage non-consenting kid. There are lots of people who aren't Christian who would say such behavior wrong. in fact, I suspect most anyone here (perhaps EVERYONE here) would say it was wrong, and certainly not everyone here is a Christian. So in point of fact, this \"higher moral\" standard you speak of is certainly not limited to Christianity. So why is it more hypocritical for this man to do it than a NON-Christian who claims that such behavior is wrong? And for that matter, we don't even know if this man ever taught such behavior is wrong, specifically (though I'm not saying that makes it any less wrong; I'm saying that his case doesn't make it any MORE wrong.) You see, what makes this potentially hypocritical is not that he is a Christian. It is that he likely says that such behavior is wrong and then turns around and does it himself. But lots of people, including NON-Christians, feel this behavior is wrong.\n \n \nYou can tell them that christians are just as dirty, sinful and perverted as anyone else.\n\n \n ??? No one said they weren't as \"dirty, sinful, and perverted\" as anyone else. And frankly, it seems that the one here who is angry is you. \n \n \nI notice that you and others immediately justified the actions of this man by bringing up the Catholic Church.\n\n \n I certainly have not justified this man's actions in any way.\n \n \nAnd therefore most christians shouldn't be concerned about this, is that it? Or is it that most christians actually expect this from their leaders? Why aren't christians concerned.\n\n \n I indeed am concerned in terms that this is a person who was in charge of a school, and potentially has opportunity to cause harm to teenagers. But no, the fact he was probably a Christian doesn't warrant greater concern than anyone engaging in such wrong behavior. After all, such behavior is wrong in ANY case, whether the guy was Christian, Buddhist, atheist, non-religious, etc. I'd be equally concerned if it were a non-religious person at a secular or public school.\n \n \nWhy the anger at me? (read the thread. I also got real rage from christians on other boards to the extent that two were warned). Why aren't christians appalled at this man's actions?\n\n \n If anger was expressed toward you, perhaps it is because it appears to some that you started these discussions to try and make Christians look bad or for no other reason than to play the hypocrisy card. It's sort of ironic really, because you're chastising Christians for not being angry at this man, yet you yourself are using him and his crime as a means to an end against Christians rather than being angry at him. If you were really indignant over what he did, your post would have been focused on him and how awful of a thing it was rather than using him to be accusatively focused on Christians who had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with this event.",

   "Sounds good for you, but it also say's this, \n \n  throughout Asia it is common to find people praying to the Buddha or to the many clearly mythical figures that populate Buddhist iconography. Pilgrims flock to stupas that are said to hold relics of the Buddha. Some schools of Buddhism are deeply devotional.\n Even in the nondevotional schools, such as Theravada or Zen, there are rituals that involve bowing and offering food, flowers and incense to a Buddha figure on an altar. \n \n which shows just how perverted and cultish it is. It doesn't believe in Gods yet people pray before idols. It is a demonic belief system and is made up of uncountable numbers of false idols its followers can and do worship.\n\n But still Buddhism is fundamentally atheistic as it professes no belief in a creator God; an all-powerful being.

   "Simple, it's a lie and a complete distortion of what I said...\n \n Again, stop trying to distort the issue, and show me where you&#8217;re not appealing to vacuous circular logic. Your point is clearly that you are on a higher moral plane than the rest of us, but we can&#8217;t see that because we&#8217;re not on that plane. That&#8217;s vacuous and circular. I&#8217;ve posted the original comment below so people can decide for themselves...\n \n \nOriginal Post\n I dare say an atheist has no such conviction regarding their thought life. And if they did, they would have no compunction to confess it to an invisible God they don't even believe exists. So the presence of the Holy Spirit within believers makes us aware of a level of morality and personal accountability that the unsaved, (or spiritually dead) person can not even relate to.\n\n \n \ndo you go before God in your thought life and ask Him to forgive you for sinning against Him by thinking thoughts that are sinful? \n\n \n I answer to my conscience. I find it easier to relate to. Who are you to limit God by arguing he&#8217;s not influencing that? \n \n \nAnd on what basis would you even determine that thoughts are sinful? \n\n \n See above. I don&#8217;t use the word sinful, I say wrong or immoral....\n \n \nAnswer those questions to prove you're not lying about my statement being false. You wont though. \n\n \n Erm.......\n \n \nBut that doesn't surprise me coming from someone who interprets everything to fit their personal preferences. \n\n \n I want to say one word to you, just one word. PROJECTION! \n \n \nI wasn't asking you to think like me at all, just saying that if you knew the truth, then you wouldn't disagree with me as you do. \n\n \n TS! IB! (I&#8217;ll leave that to see if anyone is as nerdy as me.... emoticon_xagree )\n \n \nWe can't both be right and just because I disagree with you, it doesn't mean I'm wrong. But in your mind, that's exactly what it means. \n\n \n I would definitely see someone about your habit of projection. It doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re right either. Most of us look at evidence and try to decide on that... \n \n \nThen let me repeat myself: I admit it aggravates people like you who think you know what's true when you have no concept of it at all. But it isn't my ego speaking at all. It's my rational mind, and it's based on spiritual truths you are unable to see. So as much as that offends you Gazza, it's true. \n\n \n Repeating the same flawed statement doesn&#8217;t make it true.... Interesting definition of rational, I must say...\n \n \nTalks so cheap with you pseudo intellectuals. Who's getting roasted? And since when am I the ignorant one because you can't understand english? \n\n \n I have no idea what that first sentence is meant to mean. I don&#8217;t think it actually counts as a grammatically correct sentence at all, but it&#8217;s been a while since I studied English Lit. I think these boards prove one of two things. Either, you can&#8217;t read properly and thus can&#8217;t criticise anyone about their ability, or you are purposefully and arrogantly ignorant so as to avoid challenging your narrow limited view of God, in which case you can&#8217;t comment on ignorance....\n \n EDIT: Brainwave! You missed the apostrophe in that first sentance! Given that you spam the boards with reams of scripture, I don't think you can complain at those of us who articulate our own ideas.....\n \n \nYou just proved my point Gazza by posting your response to my accusations which proved nothing at all in your favor. \n\n \n Well given I responded to your points and you refused to substantiate them, I guess we can all see whose favour this is in...",
