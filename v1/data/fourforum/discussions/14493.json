   "Raging Against Self Defense:\n A Psychiatrist Examines The Anti-Gun Mentality\n \n By Sarah Thompson, M.D.\n righter@therighter.com\n \n \"You don't need to have a gun; the police will protect you.\"\n \n \"If people carry guns, there will be murders over parking spaces and neighborhood basketball games.\"\n \n \"I'm a pacifist. Enlightened, spiritually aware people shouldn't own guns.\"\n \n \"I'd rather be raped than have some redneck militia type try to rescue me.\" \n \n How often have you heard these statements from misguided advocates of victim disarmament, or even woefully uninformed relatives and neighbors? Why do people cling so tightly to these beliefs, in the face of incontrovertible evidence that they are wrong? Why do they get so furiously angry when gun owners point out that their arguments are factually and logically incorrect?\n \n How can you communicate with these people who seem to be out of touch with reality and rational thought?\n \n One approach to help you deal with anti-gun people is to understand their psychological processes. Once you understand why these people behave so irrationally, you can communicate more effectively with them.\n \n Defense Mechanisms\n \n Projection\n \n About a year ago I received an e-mail from a member of a local Jewish organization. The author, who chose to remain anonymous, insisted that people have no right to carry firearms because he didn't want to be murdered if one of his neighbors had a \"bad day\". (I don't know that this person is a \"he\", but I'm assuming so for the sake of simplicity.) I responded by asking him why he thought his neighbors wanted to murder him, and, of course, got no response. The truth is that he's statistically more likely to be murdered by a neighbor who doesn't legally carry a firearm1 and more likely to be shot accidentally by a law enforcement officer.1\n \n How does my correspondent \"know\" that his neighbors would murder him if they had guns? He doesn't. What he was really saying was that if he had a gun, he might murder his neighbors if he had a bad day, or if they took his parking space, or played their stereos too loud. This is an example of what mental health professionals call projection - unconsciously projecting one's own unacceptable feelings onto other people, so that one doesn't have to own them.3 In some cases, the intolerable feelings are projected not onto a person, but onto an inanimate object, such as a gun,4 so that the projector believes the gun itself will murder him.\n \n Projection is a defense mechanism. Defense mechanisms are unconscious psychological mechanisms that protect us from feelings that we cannot consciously accept.5 They operate without our awareness, so that we don't have to deal consciously with \"forbidden\" feelings and impulses. Thus, if you asked my e-mail correspondent if he really wanted to murder his neighbors, he would vehemently deny it, and insist that other people want to kill him.\n \n Projection is a particularly insidious defense mechanism, because it not only prevents a person from dealing with his own feelings, it also creates a world where he perceives everyone else as directing his own hostile feelings back at him.6\n \n All people have violent, and even homicidal, impulses. For example, it's common to hear people say \"I'd like to kill my boss\", or \"If you do that one more time I'm going to kill you.\" They don't actually mean that they're going to, or even would, kill anyone; they're simply acknowledging anger and frustration. All of us suffer from fear and feelings of helplessness and vulnerability. Most people can acknowledge feelings of rage, fear, frustration, jealousy, etc. without having to act on them in inappropriate and destructive ways.\n \n Some people, however, are unable consciously to admit that they have such \"unacceptable\" emotions. They may have higher than average levels of rage, frustration, or fear. Perhaps they fear that if they acknowledge the hostile feelings, they will lose control and really will hurt someone. They may believe that \"good people\" never have such feelings, when in fact all people have them.\n \n This is especially true now that education \"experts\" commonly prohibit children from expressing negative emotions or aggression. Instead of learning that such emotions are normal, but that destructive behavior needs to be controlled, children now learn that feelings of anger are evil, dangerous and subject to severe punishment.7To protect themselves from \"being bad\", they are forced to use defense mechanisms to avoid owning their own normal emotions. Unfortunately, using such defense mechanisms inappropriately can endanger their mental health; children need to learn how to deal appropriately with reality, not how to avoid it.8\n \n (This discussion of psychological mechanisms applies to the average person who is uninformed, or misinformed, about firearms and self-defense. It does not apply to the anti- gun ideologue. Fanatics like Charles Schumer know the facts about firearms, and advocate victim disarmament consciously and willfully in order to gain political power. This psychological analysis does not apply to them.)\n \n Denial\n \n Another defense mechanism commonly utilized by supporters of gun control is denial. Denial is simply refusing to accept the reality of a given situation.9 For example, consider a woman whose husband starts coming home late, has strange perfume on his clothes, and starts charging flowers and jewelry on his credit card. She may get extremely angry at a well-meaning friend who suggests that her husband is having an affair. The reality is obvious, but the wronged wife is so threatened by her husband's infidelity that she is unable to accept it, and so denies its existence.\n \n Anti-gun people do the same thing. It's obvious that we live in a dangerous society, where criminals attack innocent people. Just about everyone has been, or knows someone who has been, victimized. It's equally obvious that law enforcement can't protect everyone everywhere 24 hours a day. Extensive scholarly research demonstrates that the police have no legal duty to protect you10 and that firearm ownership is the most effective way to protect yourself and your family.11 There is irrefutable evidence that victim disarmament nearly always precedes genocide.12 Nonetheless, the anti-gun folks insist, despite all evidence to the contrary, that \"the police will protect you\", \"this is a safe neighborhood\" and \"it can't happen here\", where \"it\" is everything from mugging to mass murder.\n \n Anti-gun people who refuse to accept the reality of the proven and very serious dangers of civilian disarmament are using denial to protect themselves from the anxiety of feeling helpless and vulnerable. Likewise, gun owners who insist that \"the government will never confiscate my guns\" are also using denial to protect themselves from the anxiety of contemplating being forcibly disarmed and rendered helpless and vulnerable.\n \n Reaction Formation\n \n Reaction formation is yet another defense mechanism common among the anti-gun folks. Reaction formation occurs when a person's mind turns an unacceptable feeling or desire into its complete opposite.13 For example, a child who is jealous of a sibling may exhibit excessive love and devotion for the hated brother or sister.\n \n Likewise, a person who harbors murderous rage toward his fellow humans may claim to be a devoted pacifist and refuse to eat meat or even kill a cockroach.14 Often such people take refuge in various spiritual disciplines and believe that they are \"superior\" to \"less civilized\" folks who engage in \"violent behavior\" such as hunting, or even target shooting. They may devote themselves to \"animal welfare\" organizations that proclaim that the rights of animals take precedence over the rights of people.15 This not only allows the angry person to avoid dealing with his rage, it allows him actually to harm the people he hates without having to know he hates them.\n \n This is not meant to disparage the many wonderful people who are pacifists, spiritually inclined, vegetarian, or who support animal welfare. The key issue is not the belief itself, but rather the way in which the person experiences and lives his beliefs. Sincere practitioners seek to improve themselves, or to be helpful in a gentle, respectful fashion. They work to persuade others peacefully by setting an example of what they believe to be correct behavior. Sincere pacifists generally exhibit good will towards others, even towards persons with whom they might disagree on various issues.\n \n Contrast the sincere pacifist or animal lover with the strident, angry person who wants to ban meat and who believes murdering hunters is justified in order to \"save the animals\" - or the person who wants to outlaw self- defense and believes innocent people have the obligation to be raped and murdered for the good of society. For example, noted feminist Betty Friedan said \"that lethal violence even in self defense only engenders more violence.\"16 The truly spiritual, pacifist person refrains from forcing others to do what he believes, and is generally driven by positive emotions, while the angry person finds \"socially acceptable\" ways to harm, abuse, or even kill, his fellow man.\n \n In the case of anti-gun people, reaction formation keeps any knowledge of their hatred for their fellow humans out of consciousness, while allowing them to feel superior to \"violent gun owners\". At the same time, it also allows them to cause serious harm, and even loss of life, to others by denying them the tools necessary to defend themselves. This makes reaction formation very attractive from a psychological point of view, and therefore very difficult to counteract.\n \n Defense mechanisms are normal. All of us use them to some extent, and their use does not imply mental illness. Advocates of victim disarmament may be misguided or uninformed, they may be stupid, or they may be consciously intent on evil, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are \"mentally ill\".\n \n Some defense mechanisms, however, are healthier than others. A safe general rule is that a defense is healthy if it helps you to function better in your personal and professional life, and unhealthy if it interferes with your life, your relationships, or the well-being of others. Young children utilize projection and denial much more commonly than do healthy adults. On the other hand, \"if projection is used as a defense mechanism to a very great extent in adult life, the user's perception of external reality will be seriously distorted.\"17\n \n Defense mechanisms are also frequently combined, so that an anti-gun person may use several defense mechanisms simultaneously. For example, my unfortunate correspondent uses projection to create a world in which all his neighbors want to murder him. As a result, he becomes more angry and fearful, and needs to employ even more defense mechanisms to cope. So he uses projection to attribute his own rage to others, he uses denial that there is any danger to protect himself from a world where he believes he is helpless and everyone wants to murder him, and he uses reaction formation to try to control everyone else's life because his own is so horribly out of control.\n \n Also, it's important to remember that not all anti-gun beliefs are the result of defense mechanisms. Some people suffer from gun phobia18, an excessive and completely irrational fear of firearms, usually caused by the anti-gun conditioning they've been subjected to by the media, politicians, so-called \"educators,\" and others. In some cases, gun phobia is caused by an authentic bad experience associated with a firearm. But with all due respect to Col. Jeff Cooper, who coined the term \"hoplophobia\" to describe anti-gun people, most anti-gun people do not have true phobias. Interestingly, a person with a true phobia of guns realizes his fear is excessive or unreasonable,19 something most anti-gun folks will never admit.\n \n Defense mechanisms distort reality\n \n Because defense mechanisms distort reality in order to avoid unpleasant emotions, the person who uses them has an impaired ability to recognize and accept reality. This explains why my e-mail correspondent and many other anti-gun people persist in believing that their neighbors and co- workers will become mass murderers if allowed to own firearms.\n \n People who legally carry concealed firearms are actually less violent and less prone to criminal activity of all kinds than is the general population.20 A person who has a clean record, has passed an FBI background check, undergone firearms training, and spent several hundred dollars to get a permit and a firearm, is highly unlikely to choose to murder a neighbor. Doing so would result in his facing a police manhunt, a trial, prison, possibly capital punishment, and the destruction of his family, job, and reputation. Obviously it would make no sense for such a person to shoot a neighbor - except in self-defense. Equally obviously, the anti-gun person who believes that malicious shootings by ordinary gun owners are likely to occur is not in touch with reality.21\n \n The Common Thread: Rage\n \n In my experience, the common thread in anti-gun people is rage. Either anti-gun people harbor more rage than others, or they're less able to cope with it appropriately. Because they can't handle their own feelings of rage, they are forced to use defense mechanisms in an unhealthy manner. Because they wrongly perceive others as seeking to harm them, they advocate the disarmament of ordinary people who have no desire to harm anyone. So why do anti-gun people have so much rage and why are they unable to deal with it in appropriate ways? Consider for a moment that the largest and most hysterical anti-gun groups include disproportionately large numbers of women, African- Americans and Jews. And virtually all of the organizations that claim to speak for these \"oppressed people\" are stridently anti-gun. Not coincidentally, among Jews, Blacks and women there are many \"professional victims\" who have little sense of identity outside of their victimhood.\n \n Identity as Victim\n \n If I were to summarize this article in three sentences, they would be:\n \n (1) People who identify themselves as \"victims\" harbor excessive amounts of rage at other people, whom they perceive as \"not victims.\"\n \n (2) In order psychologically to deal with this rage, these \"victims\" utilize defense mechanisms that enable them to harm others in socially acceptable ways, without accepting responsibility or suffering guilt, and without having to give up their status as \"victims.\"\n \n (3) Gun owners are frequently the targets of professional victims because gun owners are willing and able to prevent their own victimization. \n \n Thus the concept of \"identity as victim\" is essential. How and why do members of some groups choose to identify themselves as victims and teach their children to do the same? While it's true that women, Jews, and African- Americans have historically been victimized, they now participate in American society on an equal basis. And other groups, most notably Asian-Americans, have been equally victimized, and yet have transcended the \"eternal victim\" mentality.\n \n Why, for example, would a 6'10\" NBA player who makes $10 million a year see himself as a \"victim\"? Why would a successful, respected, wealthy, Jewish physician regard himself as a \"victim\"? Conversely, why might a wheelchair bound woman who lives on government disability NOT regard herself as a victim?\n \n I would argue it's because the basketball player and the physician believe that their identities are dependent on being victims - not because they have actually been victimized, but because they're members of groups that claim victim status. Conversely, the disabled woman was probably raised to believe that she is responsible for her own success or failure.\n \n In fact, many people who have been victims of actual violent crime, or who have survived war or civil strife, support the right of self-defense. The old saying is often correct: \"a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged.\"\n \n Special Treatment and Misleading Leaders\n \n Two reasons for these groups to insist on \"victim\" status seem likely. First, by claiming victim status, members of these groups can demand (and get) special treatment through quotas, affirmative action, reparations, and other preferential treatment programs.\n \n Second, these people have been indoctrinated to believe that there is no alternative to remaining a victim forever. Their leaders remind them constantly that they are mistreated in every imaginable way (most of them imaginary!), attribute every one of life's misfortunes to \"racism\" or \"sexism\" or \"hate crimes\", and dream up ever more complex schemes for special treatment and favors.22 These leaders are the ones who preach that the entire Black experience is slavery and racism, or that Jewish history before and after the Holocaust is irrelevant,23 or that happily married women are really victims of sexual slavery.24\n \n Likewise, the NAACP is suing firearms manufacturers to put them out of business,25 and is especially opposed to the inexpensive pistols that enable the poor to defend themselves in gang-ridden inner cities. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed evicting anyone who dares to keep a tool of self-defense in any of its crime-infested housing projects. Jewish leaders, especially those in the politically correct \"Reform\" branch, preach that gun control is \"a solemn religious obligation\",26 contrary to the teachings of their sacred scriptures and their own history.27 Law enforcement agencies falsely teach women that they are safest if they don't resist rapists and robbers,28 while women's organizations advocate gun control, thus rendering women and their children defenseless.\n \n Victimhood is good business for organizations that foster victim status. As victims, the members depend upon the organization to protect them, and the organization in turn relies on members for funding and political power. In the interest of self-preservation, these organizations work hard at preserving hatred and bigotry and at keeping their members defenseless - and therefore dependent.\n \n Anti-gun groups love victims!\n \n From my observations, pro-victimhood is a feature of all of the anti-gun special interest groups, not just the ones mentioned here. Every organization that supports gun control apparently wants its members to be helpless, terrified and totally dependent on someone else to control every aspect of their lives. It doesn't matter whether it's a religious, racial, ethnic, political, social, or charitable group. From Handgun Control, Inc. to the Anti- Defamation League to the Million Mom March, they all want you to live in fear. In this scheme, soccer moms are \"victims\" just as much as are inner-city minorities.\n \n If these organizations truly cared about the people for whom they claim to speak, they would encourage safe and responsible firearms ownership. They would help people to learn how to defend themselves and their families so that they wouldn't have to live in fear. They would tell everyone that one of the wonderful things about being an American is that you have the right to keep and bear arms, the right to defend yourself, and how these rights preserve the right to be free.\n \n The psychological price of being a victim\n \n In our current society, victimhood has many perceived benefits, but there are some serious drawbacks. Victims tend to see the world as a scary and threatening place. They believe that others treat them differently, unfairly, and even maliciously - and that they are helpless to do anything about it. This belief, that they are being mistreated and are helpless to resist, generates tremendous rage, and often, serious depression.\n \n But for victims to show rage openly can be dangerous, if not outright suicidal. For example, a battered woman who screams at or hits her attacker may provoke worse beatings or even her own murder. And a person who successfully defends himself loses his status as \"victim.\" For someone whose entire identity is dependent on being a victim, the loss of victim status is just as threatening as loss of life.\n \n So, unable psychologically to cope with such rage, people who view themselves as victims: (1) use defense mechanisms to displace it into irrational beliefs about neighbors killing each other, and the infallibility of police protection, and (2) attempt to regain control by controlling gun owners, whom they wrongly perceive as \"the enemy\".\n \n Say NO to being a victim!\n \n But no one needs to be a victim! Quite simply, it's not very easy to victimize a person who owns and knows how to use a firearm. If most women owned and carried firearms, rapes and beating would decrease.29 Thugs who target the elderly and disabled would find honest work once they realized they were likely to be looking down the barrel of a pistol or shotgun. It's nearly impossible to enslave, or herd into concentration camps, large numbers of armed people.\n \n Communicating with anti-gun people\n \n How can you communicate more effectively with an anti-gun person who is using unhealthy defense mechanisms? There are no quick and easy answers. But there are a few things you should keep in mind.\n \n Anger and attacks do not work\n \n Most gun owners, when confronted by an anti-gun person, become angry and hostile. This is understandable, because gun owners increasingly face ridicule, persecution and discrimination. (If you don't believe this, ask yourself if anyone would seriously introduce legislation to ban African- Americans, women, or Jews from post offices, schools, and churches. Even convicted felons aren't banned from such places - but peaceful armed citizens are!) But an angry response is counterproductive.\n \n It's not helpful to attack the person you're trying to persuade. Anything that makes him feel more fearful or angry will only intensify his defenses. Your goal is to help the person feel safe, and then to provide experiences and information that will help him to make informed decisions.\n \n Be Gentle\n \n You should never try to break down a defense mechanism by force. Remember that defense mechanisms protect people from feelings they cannot handle, and if you take that protection away, you can cause serious psychological harm. And because defense mechanisms operate unconsciously, it won't do any good to show an anti-gun person this article or to point out that he's using defense mechanisms. Your goal is gently and gradually to help the person to have a more realistic and rational view of the world. This cannot be done in one hour or one day.\n \n As you reach out to people in this way, you need to deal with both the illogical thought processes involved and the emotional reactions that anti-gun people have to firearms. When dealing with illogical thought processes, you are attempting to use reason and logic to convince the anti-gun person that his perception of other people and his perception of firearms are seriously inaccurate. The goal is to help him to understand that armed citizens and firearms are not threats, and may even save his life.\n \n Reversing Irrational thoughts\n \n The Mirror Technique\n \n One approach that can be helpful is simply to feed back what the anti-gun person is telling you, in a neutral, inquisitive way. So, when replying to my anonymous e-mail correspondent (above), I might respond, \"So you fear if your neighbors had guns, they would use them to murder you. What makes you think that?\" When you simply repeat what the person has said, and ask questions, you are not directly challenging his defenses. You are holding up a mirror to let him see his own views. If he has very strong defenses, he can continue to insist that his neighbors want to murder him. However, if his defenses are less rigid, he may start to question his position.\n \n Another example might be, \"Why do you think that your children's schoolteachers would shoot them?\" You might follow this up with something like, \"Why do you entrust your precious children to someone you believe would murder them?\" Again, you are merely asking questions, and not directly attacking the person or his defenses.\n \n Of course the anti-gun person might continue to insist that the teachers really would harm children, but prohibiting them from owning guns would prevent it. So you might ask how using a gun to murder innocent children is different from stabbing children with scissors, assaulting them with baseball bats, or poisoning the milk and cookies.\n \n It's important to ask \"open-ended\" questions that require a response other than \"yes\" or \"no\". Such questions require the anti-gun person actually to think about what he is saying. This will help him to re-examine his beliefs. It may also encourage him to ask you questions about firearms use and ownership.\n \n The \"What Would You Do?\" Technique\n \n Once you have a dialogue going with an anti-gun person, you might want to insert him into a hypothetical scenario, although doing so is a greater threat to his defenses, and is therefore more risky. You might ask how he would deal with a difficult or annoying co-worker. He will likely respond that he would never resort to violence, but \"other people\" would, especially if they had guns. (Projection again.) You can then ask him who these \"other people\" are, why they would shoot a co-worker, and what the shooter would gain by doing so.\n \n Don't try to \"win\" the argument. Don't try to embarrass the person you're trying to educate. Remember that no one likes to admit that his deeply held beliefs are wrong. No one likes to hear \"I told you so!\" Be patient and gentle. If you are arrogant, condescending, hurtful or rude to the anti-gun person, you will only convince him that gun owners are arrogant, hurtful people - who should not be trusted with guns!\n \n Defusing Emotional reactions\n \n The \"You Are There\" Technique\n \n Rational arguments alone are not likely to be successful, especially since many people \"feel\" rather than \"think\". You also need to deal with the emotional responses of the anti-gun person. Remember that most people have been conditioned to associate firearms with dead toddlers. So you need to change the person's emotional responses along with his thoughts.\n \n One way to do this is to put the anti-gun person (or his family) at a hypothetical crime scene and ask what he would like to have happen. For example, \"Imagine your wife is in the parking lot at the supermarket and two men grab her. One holds a knife to her throat while the other tears her clothes off. If I see this happening and have a gun, what should I do? What would happen next? What if after five minutes, the police still haven't arrived?\"\n \n Just let him answer the questions and mentally walk through the scenario. Don't argue with his answers. You are planting seeds in his mind than can help change his emotional responses.\n \n The Power of Empathy\n \n Another emotion-based approach that is often more successful is to respond sympathetically to the plight of the anti-gun person.\n \n Imagine for a moment how you would feel if you believed your neighbors and co-workers wanted to kill you and your family, and you could do nothing at all about it except to wait for the inevitable to occur.\n \n Not very pleasant, is it?\n \n This is the world in which opponents of armed self-defense live. All of us have had times in our lives when we felt \"different\" and had to contend with hostile schoolmates, co- workers, etc. So we need to invoke our own compassion for these terrified people. Say something like, \"It must be awful to live in fear of being assaulted by your own neighbors. I remember what it was like when I was the only (Jew, Mormon, African-American, Republican) in my (class, football team, workplace) - and even then I didn't think anyone was going to kill me.\" It's essential that you sincerely feel some compassion and empathy; if you're glib or sarcastic, this won't work.\n \n Using empathy works in several ways. First, it defuses a potentially hostile interaction. Anti-gun people are used to being attacked, not understood, by advocates of gun rights. Instead of an \"evil, gun-toting, extremist\", you are now a sympathetic, fellow human being. This may also open the door for a friendly conversation, in which you can each discover that your \"opponent\" is a person with whom you have some things in common. You may even create an opportunity to dispel some of the misinformation about firearms and self-defense that is so prevalent.\n \n This empathy technique is also useful for redirecting, or ending, a heated argument that has become hostile and unproductive. It allows you to escape from the dead end of \"guns save lives\" vs. \"the only reason to have a gun is to murder children.\" With empathy you can reframe the argument entirely. Instead of arguing about whether more lives are saved or lost as a result of gun ownership, you can comment on how terrifying it must be to live in a country where 80 million people own guns \"solely for the purpose of murdering children\".\n \n You should not expect any of these approaches to work immediately; they won't. With rare exceptions, the anti-gun person is simply not going to \"see the light,\" thank you profusely, and beg you to take him shooting. What you are doing is putting tiny chinks into the armor of the person's defenses, or planting seeds that may someday develop into a more open mind or a more rational analysis. This process can take months or years. But it does work!\n \n Corrective Experiences\n \n Perhaps the most effective way to dissolve defense mechanisms, however, is by providing corrective experiences30. Corrective experiences are experiences that allow a person to learn that his ideas about gun owners and guns are incorrect in a safe and non-threatening way. To provide a corrective experience, you first allow the person to attempt to project his incorrect ideas onto you. Then, you demonstrate that he is wrong by your behavior, not by arguing.\n \n For example, the anti-gun person will unconsciously attempt to provoke you by claiming that gun owners are uneducated \"rednecks,\" or by treating you as if you are an uneducated \"redneck.\" If you get angry and respond by calling him a \"stupid, liberal, socialist\", you will prove his point. However, if you casually talk about your M.B.A., your trip to the Shakespeare festival, your vegetable garden, or your daughter's ballet recital, you will provide him with the opportunity to correct his misconceptions.\n \n If you have used the above techniques, then you have already provided one corrective experience. You have demonstrated to the frightened, anti-gun person that gun owners are not abusive, scary, dangerous and sub-human monsters, but normal, everyday people who care about their families, friends and even strangers.\n \n As many gun owners have already discovered, the most important corrective experiences involve actually exposing the fearful person to a firearm. It is almost never advisable to tell someone that you carry a concealed firearm, but there are ways to use your own experience favorably.\n \n For example, if you're dealing with an anti-gun person with whom you interact regularly and have a generally good relationship - a coworker, neighbor, church member, etc. - you might indirectly refer to concealed carry. You should never say anything like \"I'm carrying a gun right now and you can't even tell,\" especially because in some states that would be considered illegal, \"threatening\" behavior. But you might consider saying something like, \"I sometimes carry a firearm, and you've never seemed to be uncomfortable around me.\" Whether to disclose this information is an individual decision, and you should consider carefully other consequences before using this approach.\n \n First-hand experience\n \n Ultimately, your goal is to take the anti-gun person shooting. Some people will accept an invitation to accompany you to the range, but others are too frightened to do so, and will need some preliminary experience.\n \n First, you want to encourage the anti-gun person to have some contact with a firearm in whatever way feels most comfortable to him. Many people seem to believe that firearms have minds of their own and shoot people of their own volition. So you might want to start by inviting him simply to look at and then handle an unloaded firearm. This also provides you the opportunity to show the inexperienced person how to tell whether a firearm is loaded and to teach him the basic rules of firearms safety.\n \n Encourage the newcomer to ask questions and remember that your role is to present accurate information in a friendly, responsible and non-threatening way. This is a good time to offer some reading material on the benefits of firearms ownership. But be careful not to provide so much information that it's overwhelming. And remember this is not the time to launch into anti-government rants, the New World Order, conspiracy theories, or any kind of political talk!\n \n Next, you can invite your friend to accompany you to the shooting range. (And if you're going to trust each other with loaded guns, you should consider yourselves friends!) Assure him that no one will force him to shoot a gun and he's free just to watch. Let him know in advance what he will experience and what will be expected of him. This includes such things as the need for eye and ear protection, a cap, appropriate clothing, etc. Make sure you have a firearm appropriate for your guest should s/he decide to try shooting. This means a lower caliber firearm that doesn't have too much recoil. If your guest is a woman, make sure the firearm will fit her appropriately. Many rifles have stocks that are too long for small women, and double-stack semi-autos are usually too large for a woman's hand.\n \n Remember that just visiting the range can be a corrective experience. Your guest will learn that gun owners are disciplined, responsible, safety-conscious, courteous, considerate, and follow the rules. He will see people of all ages, from children to the elderly, male and female, enjoying an activity together. He will not see a single \"beer-swilling redneck\" waving a firearm in people's faces.\n \n In my experience, most people who visit a range will decide they do want to try shooting. Remember to make sure your guest understands all the safety rules and range rules before allowing him to handle a firearm. If you don't feel competent to teach a newcomer to shoot, ask an instructor or range master to assist. Remember to provide lots of positive feedback and encouragement. If you're lucky, you'll recruit a new firearms enthusiast.\n \n But even if your guest decides that shooting is \"not for him\", he will have learned many valuable lessons. He will know basic rules of firearms safety, and how to clear a firearm should he need to do so. This may well save his life someday. He will know that guns do not fire unless a person pulls the trigger. He will know that gun owners are friendly, responsible people, not very different from him. Even if he chooses not to fire a gun ever again, he will be less likely to fear and persecute gun owners. And who knows - a few months or years later he may decide to become a gun owner.\n \n Why these techniques do not always work\n \n You should remember that you will not be successful with all anti-gun people. Some people are so terrified and have such strong defenses, that it's not possible for someone without professional training to get through. Some people have their minds made up and refuse to consider opening them. Others may concede that what you say \"makes sense,\" but are unwilling to challenge the forces of political correctness. A few may have had traumatic experiences with firearms from which they have not recovered.\n \n You will also not be successful with the anti-gun ideologues, people like Charles Schumer and Dianne Feinstein. These people have made a conscious choice to oppose firearms ownership and self-defense. They almost always gain power, prestige, and money from their anti-gun politics. They are not interested in the facts or in saving lives. They know the facts and understand the consequences of their actions, and will happily sacrifice innocent people if it furthers their selfish agenda. Do not use these techniques on such people. They only respond to fears of losing the power, prestige and money that they covet.31\n \n Conclusion\n \n By better understanding advocates of civilian disarmament, and by learning and practicing some simple techniques to deal with their psychological defenses, you will be much more effective in your efforts to communicate with anti-gun people. This will enable you to be more successful at educating them about the realities of firearms and self- defense, and their importance to our liberty and safety.\n \n Educating others about firearms is hard work. It's not glamorous, and it generally needs to be done one person at a time. But it's a very necessary and important task. The average American supports freedom of speech and freedom of religion, whether or not he chooses to exercise them. He supports fair trials, whether or not he's ever been in a courtroom. He likewise needs to understand that self- defense is an essential right, whether or not he chooses to own or carry a gun.\n \n \n \u00a9 2000, Sarah Thompson.\n \n Dr. Thompson is Executive Director of Utah Gun Owners Alliance, www.utgoa.org and also writes The Righter, www.therighter.com, a monthly column on individual rights.\n \n Notes\n \n 1 Lott, John R., Jr. 1998.

   "Why is gun ownership a constitutionally protected right?\n \n In other words, what was the reason(s) that it was made a constitutionally protected right in the first place?\n\n Originally our Right to Keep and Bear Arms started with the English Bill of Rights. Blackstone as well as Heller discusses this in some detail.\n \n Now put yourself in the mindset of our Founders. They suffered a Tyrannical King George, who laid all kinds of burdens on the colony of America. The last straw came when The Revolutionary War started. The British came to both Lexington and Concord to seize the powder stores collecting individual's weapons along the way. \n \n   The Declaration of Independence \n When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\n\n As a side note, one of the things we can observe in nature is how God, (or if you don't believe, Nature&#8217;s God) hard wired into every being the self preservation instinct. We call that the Fight or flight instinct.\n \n After the Revolution, We the victorious People had no desire, what so ever, to be ruled by a central government! Found at our Nation&#8217;s archives.   The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n Alexander Hamilton 1775\n \n The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment,. or musty records. They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself,  and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. \n \n The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights. \n \n The Federalist Papers were written in order to sell the new constitution to the American People. Hamilton wrote in Fed 28, a reason why we could trust that the New Federal Government could not go rogue.  FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that \n  original right of self-defense \n which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. \n In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense.  The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair.  The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. \n\n \n   Preamble Bill of Rights \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution \n\n The restrictions were what President Obama calls a list of negative Rights against the Government! \n \n The Constitution Society says:   From the Constitution Society \n There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the \"right to keep and bear arms\". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. \n \n (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea \n \n (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution. \n\n \n   V. Drafting of the Federal Bill of Rights \n When James Madison found himself cast in the unlikely role of father of the national bill of rights,[234] he was not forced to write upon a clean slate. His first step was to obtain a pamphlet which conveniently listed all state proposals, from the Pennsylvania minority onward.[235] The problem became one of editing; out of hundreds of proposals, many redundant and some questionable, a hard core of usable proposals had to be selected. The barriers to be surmounted required discarding all controversial proposals.\n ...\n Madison's decision to include a right to arms in his federal bill of rights is hardly surprising. Such a right had been demanded in virtually every call for a bill of rights; indeed, it had received twice the number of demands accorded freedom of speech.[238] Language praising the militia had received much less support, essentially having been appended to the right to arms clause in Virginia and the two following conventions.[239] But an adaptation of the Virginia/New York/North Carolina wording combining the two held unusual promise. One of Madison's major objectives was to \"bring in\" North Carolina.[240] He hoped to convince it to ratify the Constitution by offering an acceptable bill of rights. North Carolina could hardly object to a nearly verbatim acceptance of its demand.\n\n This is how the 2nd Amendment was born!",

One is by avoidance which is aptly illustrated by first star gazer and then yourself in the time worn attempt despite SCOTUS opinion to the contrary that somehow WE have to justify a right plainly stated in the Constitution and affirmed in the 2004 DOJ study and two recent SCOTUS decisions.\n \n So, that is the same claims made no matter what the topic is all the anti Constitutionalists can do is pretend the right doesn't exist. I expect ZSU thought it would be nice for the pagans to identify with some psychological proof of their fallacies and get a little self help instead of the same \"you gotta prove your right is valid and benefits are to my advantage because...I think___________________\"\n \n Dr. Thompson makes some good points in her thesis. The radicals, Penhead, star gazer and yourself would rather start off on a tangent about \"NEED\" AND PROOF OF NEED. It is a right which would exist no matter what, it is a fact of the nature of self preservation and was not \"created\" by a document but acknowledged as a pre-existing right.\n \n I suppose the answer is to point out her diagnosis to each of your claims and avoidance techniques.

   "By Sonia Wolff\n \n   The reluctant gun owner -- I had never wanted a gun. Now I own a Smith & Wesson revolver. Why? \n ....... \n But things change. Our children left home. Our ability to slug it out with a baseball bat diminished. Home invasion robberies no longer seemed quite so abstract after a friend down the street was burglarized one day at noon, while she was in the shower. \n &#8230;.\n \n When he returned, my education about guns began: He had ordered the shotgun, and could pick it up after a 10-day waiting period, during which he would be screened for criminal activity or mental disability.\n &#8230;.\n My anxiety made me demanding. \"You must practice with that gun,\" I said. \"Learn to load it. Learn to shoot it. Make the process as habitual as unlocking our front door.\"\n \n \"What's gotten into you?\" he asked.\n \"Self-defense,\" I replied.\n &#8230;\n \"We should have a pistol,\" I finally declared. \"Something I can use.\"\n &#8230;\n Walt, a patient man with gray hair and bifocals, watched as I tried various revolvers before finally settling on a Smith & Wesson, which has a smaller grip than the Ruger and is more in sync with the size of my hand.\n \n It was only when I'd made my decision that I looked around at my fellow customers. I had imagined they would be skinheads or slick-haired, oily types who would poke at each other in amusement at my questions, my stance, my purchase.\n \n Instead, there was a clean-cut fellow wearing shorts and a Polo T-shirt. Several older guys were talking about deer and moose and elk. Everyone spoke softly. They were intent on business. Yes, one man did have a tattoo. But there was also a very nice-looking girl in her 20s, wearing one of those long black summer dresses with the little straps, looking quite glamorous. I saw her examining a Beretta. Obviously, her hands are stronger than mine, I thought, watching her pull back the slide. I resolved to exercise my hands &#8212; 20 minutes at the piano playing scales and Bach fugues every morning.\n\n   Author Sonia Wolff's Gun Essay. \n If I may, the truth is that you do not become someone else, you grow up. The reluctance Sonia describes is experienced by nearly everyone who contemplates defensive gun use. The real important thing to notice is that we are not really talking about becoming someone else, someone worse, someone angry, we remain ourselves in a new acumen of personal responsibility. Scary. Lots of self-doubt come with any large responsibility, lots of diligence comes, too. Lots of heat from others comes, too. With it comes a personal independence though, which Sonia does not seem to fear. Her frankness in her essay says that. \n \n Nor are we becoming capable of violence. Self-defense is not violence; we do not shoot to kill, we shoot to stay alive. What is the difference? The difference is that one is aggression and the other is defense. If you even tried to stop a child abduction, would that be violence or preventing violence? The first, unchecked, destroys families and whole communities, and the second protects individuals, families and whole communities.\n \n Free people live by the self-restraint of using lethal force only when facing such grave danger. A new gun owner needs to understand that she is not engaging in violence, but in resisting it. Reluctantly, but necessary. You are not the aggressor. \n",

Horrid mischief would ensue were [the good] deprived of the use of them ... the weak will become a prey to the strong.[32]\n\n \n   From these premises it followed, as Thomas Paine wrote, \nthat \"the good man\" had both right and need for arms; moreover, no law would dissuade \"the invader and the plunderer\" from having them. So, \"since some will not, others dare not lay them aside.\" \"Horrid mischief would ensue were [the law-abiding] deprived of the use of them; ... the weak will become a prey to the strong.\"[16] Cesare Beccaria assailed arms bans as a paradigm of simplistic legislation reflecting \"False Ideas of Utility.\" His discussion deserves quotation in full, in part because Thomas Jefferson laboriously copied it in long-hand into his personal compilation of great quotations:(page.91)\n\n \n Galileo looks for points when none are due his side.",

They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. \n\n \n   \n The Declaration of Independence \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\n \n How will you explain away the reasons of why the the 14th Amendment was necessary then? \n   Restoring the Privileges or Immunities Clause \n Such views are central to the historical backdrop that led the Radical Republicans to draft both the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the 14th Amendment. In each case, they sought to protect African Americans and their white allies from the depredations of the former Confederate states, including the infamous Black Codes, which curtailed property rights, liberty of contract, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms.\n\n The 14th Amendment was designed to stop Whites militia's and some government entities from disarming Freedmen or freed slaves, and engage in lynchings and the like. \n   Institute for Justice -- 14th Amendment \n 2. The history and adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment demonstrates the Framer&#8217;s specific and repeated concern that freedmen were being disarmed by state and local governments and militias, in violation of what those Framers understood to be an individual constitutional right to bear arms. In response to this Court&#8217;s previous refusal to enforce parts of the Bill of Rights directly against the States, and its holding that blacks were not citizens of the United States entitled to the rights of such citizens, the Framers set out to remedy the inability to enforce numerous constitutional rights against the States by incorporating them into the Fourteenth Amendment. Identification of the evils the 39th Congress sought to remedy &#8211; including the disarming of freedmen &#8211; the parallel legislative responses to that problem, and the specific explanations by the Framers of the purpose and function of the Fourteenth Amendment, all demonstrate that they viewed the existing constitutional right to bear arms as an individual right of personal security. And they understood and intended the language of the Fourteenth Amendment to secure such a right against the States and various militias, not merely in the service of the very entities seeking to disarm and abuse the freedmen. And by accomplishing that goal through the identification and extension of the rights of national citizens, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment also clarified and defined the underlying rights in the Second Amendment as well.\n",

   "  From the Constitution Society \n There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the \"right to keep and bear arms\". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. \n \n < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea \n\n It has been suggested that, our Founding Fathers believed that defense against an over reaching government is a Natural Right, however our Founders must not have believe Personal Self Defense as a Natural Right endowed to us by our creator. Note the word self. \n \n What is a Natural Right? A Natural Right is, as the Declaration of Independence says, God, or Nature&#8217;s God, given Rights. They are Observable in most all of nature as evidence of God given. They are hard wired into our DNA so to speak. \n \n One would have to seemingly suggest that in the Bee kingdom for instance, the only time bees, (or and other animal, for that matter,) fights or takes to flight, is when the Queen Bee gets overbearingly tyrannical! Since our creator, with these Inalienable Natural Rights, endowed us, one must then say that nowhere in nature does an animal try to defend him or herself. They just roll over and accept death.\n \n I'll leave it to the readers of this forum to make up your own minds as to weather or not Personal Self Defense is observable in Nature or not.\n \n In fact the Right of Self Defense from a tyrannical government is inherited from our Personal Right to Self Defense, and not the other way around. If there is not a right to personal defense, then one could correctly argue that their is no right to self defense from government tyranny.",

Their is more than one purpose for keeping arms. Yes our Founding Fathers did make many safeguards against a tyrannical government, and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms is to be the final check on a tyrannical government when all of the other checks and balances fails, however, neither the Bill of Rights nor the 2nd Amendment, gives us anything.

   "And even if the claims of the gun activists in this thread are correct, what about the rights of others (those who do not own guns)?\n \n Sadly, some are so fixated on what they perceive as their own rights and their guns that they fail to take the rights of others seriously. It's important to recognize that non gun owners and children have rights as well as gun owners. These rights can be violated or endangered by gun owners. Thus it is desirable to adopt public policies that best protect the rights and freedoms of everyone and not just gun owners. A look at the percentage of child homicides committed with guns reveals the fallacy of the arguments of those who claim that the danger that guns present to children is insignificant. In 2002, 57.6% of child homicides were committed with guns. \n voiceofreason2005.blogspot.com/\n\n \n Let me answer \"Voice of Reason.\" Does he blog here? I'd like to talk with him about this narrow view he has. The world is not as black and white and either/or as he wishes it to be. I support gun rights. But I reject his claim that because I do so then I must not take the rights of children and other innocent victims of gun violence seriously. I take gun violence very seriously, and I would venture to say that I have dealt with more victims of gun violence that Voice of Reason has.\n \n I also take drunk driving seriously. Now when a man kills or maims by driving recklessly or while intoxicated we don't blame the truck he drove or the Johnny Walker he drank. We don't lament America's love affair with SUVs or infatuation with bourbon. We don't seek to ban cars or bring back prohibition. We blame the criminal, and we prosecute him for his crime. No one demands, for example, that I surrender the beer in my fridge because another person just killed someone while driving drunk-under the theory that his crime means I cannot be trusted to have beer anymore. \n \n In America we protect the rights of innocents by recognizing their rights, making it a crime to violate them, and by punishing those who do so. We do not shift the blame onto the sword for the actions of the hand that wields it, nor do we seek to blame and punish the innocent for the crimes of the guilty. We do not hold a man accountable for crimes committed by others he did not know and had no influence over. We hold those who are a fault accountable-the person who chose to commit a wrongful act through an unjustifiable motive, be it anger, hatred, revenge, greed, etc. We hold accountable the person who knew right from wrong, who understood the nature and consequences of his actions, and who made a conscious choice to violate the law-in the case of murder the person who deliberately chose to take someone's life without a shred of legitimate excuse or justification. And we do not waiver or modify this view of individual responsibility merely because he chose to use a gun instead of a car or a bat to commit his crime.\n \n I know that we all would like to pretend we have the power to change the world, but for gun crimes you are dealing with the hardened hearts of men who are willing to take another's life. Ask yourself is it reasonable, merely because you feel powerless to stop murderers before they strike, to project blame for your inability to stop them on others whose only \"crime\" is to insist upon their right to lawfully and peacefully posses a firearm?\n \n As long as I live peacefully with my neighbors then my insistence that they respect all of my rights, including my RKBA, does not make me an enemy of the rights of non-gun owners. After all, do I not also have the same right to be free of gun violence? \n \n Setting aside felons for a moment, the crime does not lie in having a gun. The crime comes from using the gun (or any other weapon) to violate the rights of others. \n \n Voice of Reason, I say cast your blame at the feet of those who have earned it. Instead of blaming me, why not work with me to hold accountable those who chose to violate the rights all of us share? If you are serious about protecting the rights of the innocent, then first offer to help catch, convict, and imprison those who actually violate those rights.",

   "Bryan,\n \n Do you support the prosecution of bartenders for serving someone already intoxicated that then drives drunk and kills someone?\n \n How about a store owner that sells alcohol to a minor that then drives drunk and kills someone?\n\n \n It depends on the offense you want to prosecute them for.\n \n I say no to the drunk driving offense. The patron/driver is responsible for his own actions. If, however, a separate crime exists for serving someone who intoxicated to apparent observation then yes, prosecute the bartender for this crime. I also would not blame the other patron at the restaurant across the street for having a beer with his meal, and I would certainly not make the claim that his actions somehow show he is insensitive to the problem of drunk driving.\n \n My answer is the same with the store owner selling to a minor. You prosecute him for the crime of providing alcohol to a minor, but the drunk driving offense is the responsibility of the reckless driver.\n \n If a gun owner knowingly sells to a prohibited felon who commits a murder with the gun, then the felon alone is responsible for the murder. The gun owner's crime is giving the felon the firearm, and I have no problem with prosecuting that offense (and I have done so). \n \n Now if we have more information which suggests that the people in these examples knew that the underlying crime was going to be committed by the other person, that they approved of the crime, and that they chose to aid and abet that crime by providing the alcohol or firearm, then you would have accomplice liability.\n \n Say, for example, A has a handgun. B, a felon, comes to A and says he wants to borrow the gun. A knows B is a felon. If he gives B the gun and B, unknown to A, goes off and kills someone with the gun then B alone is responsible for the murder, and A is only responsible for providing a gun to a felon. But say B tells A the reason he wants the gun is he wants to get rid of his wife, and B asks to borrow the handgun for that purpose. If A gives him the gun on that request then A is now an accessory before the fact to the murder committed by B with the gun.",

You're not allowed to cite local laws in this discussion. For so long you've been arguing that the US Constitution was about creating a federal government to run the entire country. You cite Article 1 of the US Constitution to try and back up your militia/gun control argument. But Article 1 mentions nothing about the authority of the states, it only talks about authority of the federal government. There's no authority for one state to call into service the militia of another state, nor set rules to regulate their behavior and training.\n \n You've basically hung yourself here. Local states and jurisdictions are out of bounds, their laws have no weight. In your argument for federal control you've severed any and all rights you had to cite local laws regarding guns, the militia, and anything of the like. You're effectively limited to federal laws only and nothing else.\n \n Now that we're cleared that up, start citing every single federal law that regulated firearms in any way, shape, or form, from the founding of the federal government, to 1900. Show us the laws set forth by the federal government that dictated who was allowed to be armed, where carrying a gun was banned, where maximum caliber and minimum overall length were specified, where limits on ammunition purchases existed, where owning a handgun was forbidden, where gun trafficking was spelled out as a crime, etc.\n \n Get to work.\n \n And don't bother posting the Militia Act any further. It doesn't count since it doesn't specify that you can't own firearms, or anything even remotely similar to that.",

Institute for Justice -- 14th Amendment \n 2. The history and adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment demonstrates the Framer&#8217;s specific and repeated concern that freedmen were being disarmed by state and local governments and militias, in violation of what those Framers understood to be an individual constitutional right to bear arms. In response to this Court&#8217;s previous refusal to enforce parts of the Bill of Rights directly against the States, and its holding that blacks were not citizens of the United States entitled to the rights of such citizens, the Framers set out to remedy the inability to enforce numerous constitutional rights against the States by incorporating them into the Fourteenth Amendment.  Identification of the evils the 39th Congress sought to remedy &#8211; including the disarming of freedmen &#8211; the parallel legislative responses to that problem, and the specific explanations by the Framers of the purpose and function of the Fourteenth Amendment, all demonstrate that they viewed the existing constitutional right to bear arms as an individual right of personal security. And they understood and intended the language of the Fourteenth Amendment to secure such a right against the States and various militias, not merely in the service of the very entities seeking to disarm and abuse the freedmen. And by accomplishing that goal through the identification and extension of the rights of national citizens, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment also clarified and defined the underlying rights in the Second Amendment as well.\n \n Whatever the basis for incorporation, however, the history of the Fourteenth Amendment shows that the right to bear arms was intended to be incorporated, and thus should be read as it was understood at the time of such incorporation. \n\n After McDonald and Heller, that Proven to be the Supreme Law of the Land! \n \n However you can spin all you want, you Tasmanian Devil you! emoticon_smile Keep on talking like you actually have a point!

   "\"The passage of the National Defense Act of 1916 materially altered the status of the militias by constituting them as the National Guard.\"- Supreme Court, Maryland v. United States (1965)\n\n Really?\n 1982 COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY UNITED STATES SENATE NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS SECOND SESSION says:\n \n   97th Congress 2d Session -- THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS \n (The passage below can be found here. Scroll up one sentence. )\n \n That the National Guard is not the \"Militia\" referred to in the second amendment is even clearer today. Congress has organized the National Guard under its power to \"raise and support armies\" and not its power to \"Provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the Militia\".[65] This Congress chose to do in the interests of organizing reserve military units which were not limited in deployment by the strictures of our power over the constitutional militia, which can be called forth only \"to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.\" The modern National Guard was specifically intended to avoid status as the constitutional militia, a distinction recognized by 10 U.S.C. Sec 311(a).(p.12)\n \n Conclusion \n The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept, and wording of the second amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratification, indicates that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\n\n This is not to say that we cannot be called up, to serve our country in a time of emergency, however this has nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment.

   "What evidence do you have to support that claim? If you want to know what is meant by \"well regulated\" all you have to do is read Article 1 of the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton quotes directly from this part of the Constitution when talking about the regulation of the militia:\n \n \"This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union 'to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.' \"\n\n Alright!

To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss.

   "How does regulation of the militia by Congress in accordance with Article 1 constitute a violation of the Second Amendment? \n\n \n Let me get into the discussion. The short answer to the question is regulation of the militia and militia arms should have no impact on the individual RKBA protected in the 2nd. Amendment because, in my opinion, Article I Section 8 of the Constitution divorced individual arms from militia service.\n \n I think we need to understand the total historical context here. We know that before the Constitution was adopted a practice was, as U.S. v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) noted, for men to appear for militia service \"bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\" Id at 179. We know that before the Constitution was adopted the control over the militias was exercised by the states. Consider, for example, my state of Virginia and its Constitution adopted June 12, 1776. Virginia spoke of its militia thus:\n \n \"That a well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state, therefore, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\" Va. Constitution Art. 1 \u00a7 13\n \n Virginia also decided that this civil power was to be exercised by the Governor:\n \n \"The Governor shall be commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the Commonwealth and shall have power to embody such forces to repel invasion, suppress insurrection, and enforce the execution of the laws.\"\n Va. Constitution Art. 5 \u00a7 7\n \n And then the proposed federal Constitution comes along, which, if enacted, would radically alter the balance of control over the militia:\n \n Article I Section 8\n The Congress shall have power...\n To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\n \n And, if adopted, the congressional powers described above would be absolute because of the Article VI \"supremacy clause\":\n \n \"The Federal Government holds a decided advantage in this delicate balance: the Supremacy Clause. U.S. Const., Art. VI. As long as it is acting within the powers granted it under the Constitution, Congress may impose its will on the States. Congress may legislate in areas traditionally regulated by the States. This is an extraordinary power in a federalist system. It is a power that we must assume Congress does not exercise lightly.\" Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991):\n \n Thus, if adopted, the new Federal Constitution granted Congress the exclusive power to choose how large the state militia will be, who will be considered a member and who will not, how they will be armed, and how they will be disciplined-and the states by consequence loose all power over arming their militias.\n \n This, to my mind, puts into context the arguments of Federalists and Anti-federalists over the militia and the fear of a standing army.\n \n Many anti-federalists complained that if Congress were given the exclusive power to arm the militias then Congress could effectively disarm the state militias simply be refusing to exercise its authority to arm them. \n \n The federalist response was essentially \"so what?\" They argued the people were already armed. See, for example, Noah Webster:\n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.\" Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n The view clearly was that Congress cannot exercise a monopoly over arms because the people have a concurrent individual right to have arms-which would not be affected in any way if Congress is given absolute power to arm the militias-ie., the individual RKBA exists independent from the civic militia duty. If Congress formed an army of tyranny and both refused to arm the militias and forbade the states from providing arms to the militias, then the people in an emergency could provide these individually held arms for self-defense against a tyrant. \n \n Remember that this was the winning argument. The Constitution was adopted, and with it Congress was given the sole power over the arms of both the militias and a standing army-but not a single founder-not a single writer-suggested that Congress had thereby also been given power over individual arms. \n \n But I do not suggest that Article I Sec. 8 had no effect on the individual RKBA. On the contrary, what it did was divorce the individual RKBA from the militia. Regardless of the past system U.S. v. Miller talked about, under Article I Sec. 8 individuals can no longer provide their own arms for militia service. Congress, by having the exclusive power to choose how to arm the militias, also has the exclusive power to forbid you as an individual from using your own firearms in militia service. And it has the exclusive power to refuse to allow you to serve in a militia if you disobeyed the command and tried to use your own firearm.\n \n And here is a point that \"militia only\" interpreters of the 2nd. Amendment will not and cannot address: The federal grant of power to Congress in Article I Sec. 8 ended the relationship between individual arms and militia service. No longer would a militia rely upon men appearing bearing their own arms of different and often incompatible calibers. Now Congress was given total power to impose uniformity over militia arms, and the individual RKBA was absolutely excluded from the militia context (absent Congress consenting to or passing laws to continue the old practice-which it could do if it wanted to) In my opinion, the attempt to reinitiate that link between individual arms and militia service through a fraudulent \"militia only\" interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment is the height of folly. Here's why:\n \n The Amendment did nothing to repeal the Article I Sec. 8 Congressional power over arming the militias, and a militia-only RKBA interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment therefore becomes a nullity-\"you have a right to keep and bear arms if Congress allows you to have them.\" The argument has no basis in history, law, or common sense. Even Cruikshank refused to endorse this view:\n \n \"The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose.\" United States v. Cruishank 92 U.S. 542 (1876):\n \n Not \"for militia service\" but \"for a lawful purpose.\" \n \n And yet if \"the Right of the People\" to keep and bear arms is limited only to militia service then it is not a right at all-it merely becomes a privilege incidental to militia service which Congress has the total power to grant or withhold. This point was addressed in Heller:\n \n \"Besides ignoring the historical reality that the Second Amendment was not intended to lay down a \"novel principl[e]\" but rather codified a right \"inherited from our English ancestors,\" Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 281 (1897), petitioners' interpretation does not even achieve the narrower purpose that prompted codification of the right. If, as they believe, the Second Amendment right is no more than the right to keep and use weapons as a member of an organized militia, see Brief for Petititioners 8 - if, that is, the organized militia is the sole institutional [Slip Op. 27] beneficiary of the Second Amendment's guarantee - it does not assure the existence of a \"citizens' militia\" as a safeguard against tyranny. For Congress retains plenary authority to organize the militia, which must include the authority to say who will belong to the organized force.17 That is why the first Militia Act's requirement that only whites enroll caused States to amend their militia laws to exclude free blacks. See Siegel, The Federal Government's Power to Enact Color-Conscious Laws, 92 Nw. U. L. Rev. 477, 521-525 (1998). Thus, if petitioners are correct, the Second Amendment protects citizens' right to use a gun in an organization from which Congress has plenary authority to exclude them. It guarantees a select militia of the sort the Stuart kings found useful, but not the people's militia that was the concern of the founding generation.\" District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 26-27 (2008)\n \n Ah, but what about the \"well-regulated militia\" preamble? I have dealt with the militia preamble before. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/6957-revisiting-militia-clause.html\n \n I still argue that the 2nd. Amendment militia clause is nothing more than a restatement of the policy goal of protecting liberty by relying on militias and avoiding standing armies. I argue that this preamble statement must be aimed at Congress, which even after adoption of the 2nd. Amendment retains the sole power to make the choice of trusting national security to either a standing army or the militias. And, if Congress took the advice and chose to rely only on militias, then Article I Sec 8 provided security from a federal tyrant seizing control over the militias by reserving to the states the control of appointment of officers, thus ensuring that their loyalty would be to the states (unlike with a standing army). \n \n The bottom line is you cannot read the 2nd. Amendment to recognize or grant an individual RKBA in militia service without placing it in direct conflict with the Article I Sec. 8 grant of exclusive control over militia arms to Congress. If you read the 2nd. Amendment thus then you must also argue that the Amendment repealed that portion of Article I Sec. 8. \n \n This was never the argument of the founders. See, for example, Tench Coxe's explanation of the Amendment:\n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, describing the proposed 2nd. Amendment in his Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1.\n \n An individual RKB private arms unconnected with militia service. That is the right the Amendment was intended to protect-and it is the same right which Noah Webster says grants us sufficient power to repel a tyrant. Oh, I have seen some adherents of the \"militia service arms only\" interpretation of the Amendment try to explain away this direct interpretation. I find the attempts unsuccessful. A favorite argument against this quote is to say \"well it wasn't widely read.\" In response I ask is there a quote from a founder to the contrary that was more widely read? You see, I would rather have doubters of Coxe's explanation offer a better counter quote from a founder telling us that in his opinion the Amendment only protected (as they argue) a right to bear arms in militia service-if only such a quote existed. \n \n I can offer this quote, however, from the King James version: \"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" (Hebrews, 11:1) It is in my opinion a blind faith indeed that asks me to believe a \"militia only\" interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment individual RKBA when its adherents cannot offer a single piece of evidence to show this is what the founders actually intended. I am not willing to accept that the founders concealed their true thoughts on this view so completely from us-while founders like Coxe chose to make direct statements of opinion to the contrary. To me the \"militia arms only\" view asks me-some 200+ years after the fact-to get out the \"Ouiji board\" and hold it over the Constitution to divine a secret intention of repealing a portion of Article I Section 8, despite the lack of a single statement from a long dead founder saying this is what we meant, and while ignoring those who said \"no we meant an individual RKBA unconnected with militia service.\" I'm sorry, but I cannot do this.\n \n In the end I say militia arms used to be dependent on the individual RKBA, but Article I Sec. 8 kicked that bird out of the individual right nest. Now militia arms depend exclusively on the whim of Congress, and congressional regulation of the militia therefore has zero impact on the proper scope of the individual RKBA as protected by the 2nd. Amendment and recognized by Heller. \n \n But, that is just my view. Agree or disagree as you see fit....",

And it has the exclusive power to refuse to allow you to serve in a militia if you disobeyed the command and tried to use your own firearm.\n \n And here is a point that &#8220;militia only&#8221; interpreters of the 2nd. Amendment will not and cannot address: The federal grant of power to Congress in Article I Sec. 8 ended the relationship between individual arms and militia service. No longer would a militia rely upon men appearing bearing their own arms of different and often incompatible calibers. Now Congress was given total power to impose uniformity over militia arms, and the individual RKBA was absolutely excluded from the militia context (absent Congress consenting to or passing laws to continue the old practice&#8212;which it could do if it wanted to) In my opinion, the attempt to reinitiate that link between individual arms and militia service through a fraudulent &#8220;militia only&#8221; interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment is the height of folly.\n \n Here&#8217;s why:\n \n The Amendment did nothing to repeal the Article I Sec. 8 Congressional power over arming the militias, and a militia-only RKBA interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment therefore becomes a nullity&#8212;&#8220;you have a right to keep and bear arms if Congress allows you to have them.&#8221; The argument has no basis in history, law, or common sense. Even Cruikshank refused to endorse this view:\n \n &#8220;The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose.&#8221; United States v. Cruishank 92 U.S. 542 (1876):\n \n Not &#8220;for militia service&#8221; but &#8220;for a lawful purpose.&#8221; \n [/quo\n \n And yet if &#8220;the Right of the People&#8221; to keep and bear arms is limited only to militia service then it is not a right at all&#8212;it merely becomes a privilege incidental to militia service which Congress has the total power to grant or withhold. This point was addressed in Heller:\n \n &#8220;Besides ignoring the historical reality that the Second Amendment was not intended to lay down a &#8220;novel principl[e]&#8221; but rather codified a right &#8220;inherited from our English ancestors,&#8221; Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 281 (1897), petitioners' interpretation does not even achieve the narrower purpose that prompted codification of the right. If, as they believe, the Second Amendment right is no more than the right to keep and use weapons as a member of an organized militia, see Brief for Petititioners 8 &#8212; if, that is, the organized militia is the sole institutional [Slip Op. 27] beneficiary of the Second Amendment's guarantee &#8212; it does not assure the existence of a &#8220;citizens' militia&#8221; as a safeguard against tyranny. For Congress retains plenary authority to organize the militia, which must include the authority to say who will belong to the organized force.17 That is why the first Militia Act's requirement that only whites enroll caused States to amend their militia laws to exclude free blacks. See Siegel, The Federal Government's Power to Enact Color-Conscious Laws, 92 Nw. U. L. Rev. 477, 521-525 (1998). Thus, if petitioners are correct, the Second Amendment protects citizens' right to use a gun in an organization from which Congress has plenary authority to exclude them. It guarantees a select militia of the sort the Stuart kings found useful, but not the people's militia that was the concern of the founding generation.&#8221; District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 26-27 (2008)\n \n Ah, but what about the &#8220;well-regulated militia&#8221; preamble? I have dealt with the militia preamble before. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/6957-revisiting-militia-clause.html\n \n I still argue that the 2nd. Amendment militia clause is nothing more than a restatement of the policy goal of protecting liberty by relying on militias and avoiding standing armies. I argue that this preamble statement must be aimed at Congress, which even after adoption of the 2nd. Amendment retains the sole power to make the choice of trusting national security to either a standing army or the militias. And, if Congress took the advice and chose to rely only on militias, then Article I Sec 8 provided security from a federal tyrant seizing control over the militias by reserving to the states the control of appointment of officers, thus ensuring that their loyalty would be to the states (unlike with a standing army). \n \n The bottom line is you cannot read the 2nd. Amendment to recognize or grant an individual RKBA in militia service without placing it in direct conflict with the Article I Sec. 8 grant of exclusive control over militia arms to Congress. If you read the 2nd. Amendment thus then you must also argue that the Amendment repealed that portion of Article I Sec. 8. \n \n This was never the argument of the founders. See, for example, Tench Coxe&#8217;s explanation of the Amendment:\n \n &#8220;As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.&#8221; Tench Coxe, describing the proposed 2nd. Amendment in his Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1.\n \n An individual RKB private arms unconnected with militia service. That is the right the Amendment was intended to protect&#8212;and it is the same right which Noah Webster says grants us sufficient power to repel a tyrant. Oh, I have seen some adherents of the &#8220;militia service arms only&#8221; interpretation of the Amendment try to explain away this direct interpretation. I find the attempts unsuccessful. A favorite argument against this quote is to say &#8220;well it wasn&#8217;t widely read.&#8221; In response I ask is there a quote from a founder to the contrary that was more widely read? You see, I would rather have doubters of Coxe&#8217;s explanation offer a better counter quote from a founder telling us that in his opinion the Amendment only protected (as they argue) a right to bear arms in militia service&#8212;if only such a quote existed. \n \n I can offer this quote, however, from the King James version: &#8220;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&#8221; (Hebrews, 11:1) It is in my opinion a blind faith indeed that asks me to believe a &#8220;militia only&#8221; interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment individual RKBA when its adherents cannot offer a single piece of evidence to show this is what the founders actually intended. I am not willing to accept that the founders concealed their true thoughts on this view so completely from us&#8212;while founders like Coxe chose to make direct statements of opinion to the contrary. To me the &#8220;militia arms only&#8221; view asks me&#8212;some 200+ years after the fact&#8212;to get out the &#8220;Ouiji board&#8221; and hold it over the Constitution to divine a secret intention of repealing a portion of Article I Section 8, despite the lack of a single statement from a long dead founder saying this is what we meant, and while ignoring those who said &#8220;no we meant an individual RKBA unconnected with militia service.&#8221; I&#8217;m sorry, but I cannot do this.\n \n In the end I say militia arms used to be dependent on the individual RKBA, but Article I Sec. 8 kicked that bird out of the individual right nest. Now militia arms depend exclusively on the whim of Congress, and congressional regulation of the militia therefore has zero impact on the proper scope of the individual RKBA as protected by the 2nd. Amendment and recognized by Heller. \n \n But, that is just my view. Agree or disagree as you see fit....\n\n I don't agree with the claim that personally owned guns were entirely divorced from militia service. In fact, the Militia Act of 1792 required a man to purchase his own gun for militia service. It seems odd that a Congress in power just a few years after the ratification of the Constitution would fail to recognize this as a violation of Article 1 if it were indeed a violation. \n \n Elbridge Gerry said about the proposed conscientious objector clause:\n &#8220;I am apprehensive that this clause would give an opportunity to the people in power to destroy the constitution itself. They can declare who are the religiously scrupulous, and prevent them from bearing arms.\" \n \n And later on he is paraphrased as saying,\n \"Now, if we give a discretionary power to exclude those from militia duty who have religious scruples, we may as well make no provision on this head. For this reason, he wished the words to be altered so as to be confined to persons belonging to a religious sect scrupulous of bearing arms.\"\n Amendment II: House of Representatives, Amendments to the Constitution\n \n Notice that \"prevent them from bearing arms\" and \"exclude those from militia duty\" are used interchangeably. Gerry was afraid that such a clause would grant Congress absolute power over who was in the militia and who was not. Congress could simply claim someone was religiously scrupulous and then \"prevent them from bearing arms\". It doesn't seem likely that Gerry was worried about Congress using the the conscientious objector clause to prevent people from toting guns around for their own own private purposes. He was concerned with having an effective militia which concern is later echoed by Scott who fears that \"a militia can never be depended upon\" if large numbers of people are excluded from militia duty because of the conscientious objector clause.",

   " Webster seems to be expressing the idea that the fact that the militia is composed of the people themselves serves as a natural check on government power. Kind of like how a jury is composed of the people which serves as a protection against corrupt courts. \n\n \n We will have to agree to disagree here.\n \n \n I don't agree with the claim that personally owned guns were entirely divorced from militia service. In fact, the Militia Act of 1792 required a man to purchase his own gun for militia service. It seems odd that a Congress in power just a few years after the ratification of the Constitution would fail to recognize this as a violation of Article 1 if it were indeed a violation. \n\n \n Ah, but I do not claim that the Militia Act of 1792 was a violation of Article I section 8. It was a congressional exercise of the power granted to it under the article. As I said:\n \n &#8220;Now Congress was given total power to impose uniformity over militia arms, and the individual RKBA was absolutely excluded from the militia context (absent Congress consenting to or passing laws to continue the old practice&#8212;which it could do if it wanted to)&#8221;\n \n This is exactly what Congress did with the Militia Act. With the Militia Act Congress merely chose to exercise its total Article I Sec. 8 control over militia arms by choosing (for the time being) to continue the prevailing system&#8212;all at a cost savings to itself (sort of like government today giving my children an extensive list of mandatory school supplies we must provide because government is broke and the schools cannot afford to provide them to my children anymore). Nothing in the 2nd. Amendment deprived Congress of the power to change its mind and abandon the 1792 Militia Act. The supply of militia arms remained at the complete mercy of the whim of Congress. And no constitutional crisis&#8212;no cry of depravation of an individual right to carry private arms in militia service&#8212;occurred when Congress simply changed its mind at a later date and abandoned the 1792 Militia Act. \n \n I think we are confusing the individual RKBA for a lawful purpose and the civic duty of militia service. Although they have been historically connected they are different. Congress could pass the 1792 Militia Act because providing militia arms was never viewed as a right of the people but rather a duty of citizenship which Article I sec 8 gave Congress control over. As you say &#8220;the Militia Act of 1792 required a man&#8221;&#8212;words inconsistent with a man exercising any &#8220;right&#8221; and consistent with a congressionally imposed &#8220;duty.&#8221; In contrast to this duty, the right was to keep and bear arms for a lawful purpose&#8212;and it was never dependent upon the militia duty for existence or justification. (IMO, the RKBA only becomes dependent upon militia duty in the minds of people who dislike guns and feel they can have no legitimate purpose other than within militia service. But there is not one single founder who ever expressed that restrictive view of firearm ownership.)\n \n The individual RKBA pre-existed the Constitution. Before Article I Sec 8 the practice was to draw upon that individual right when arming the militia&#8212;and when the Constitution was adopted Congress was given the power to continue or abolish that practice. But Congress was given power over the militia duty only and not the broader pre-existing RKBA. In one sense the obligation of militia service remained unchanged. It was a civic responsibility&#8212;a duty&#8212;before the Constitution was adopted, and it remains a civic duty even to this date. The Constitutional change was made by giving Congress complete control over the duty. And I admit I&#8217;m subject to that duty today. Congress could command me to appear today for militia service. Congress could exercise its power under Article I Sec. 8 by providing me a weapon of its choice, or it could command me to purchase a weapon of its choice at my expense, or it could even tell me to show up and bring a particular firearm I own. In each event it would be my duty to comply. IMO the fallacy comes from the belief that this power over the civic duty has somehow allowed Congress to swallow and abolish the individual RKBA for a lawful purpose outside of militia service&#8212;that because Congress has supplanted the individual right as the provider of militia arms then the individual right is abolished. This argument is akin to suggesting that when Congress repealed the Militia Act of 1792 it abolished the individual RKBA&#8212;and that Congress could give the RKBA back simply by reenacting a new version of the 1792 Militia Act. I can find no founder who suggests Congress should be given power to turn on and off &#8220;individual rights&#8221; like tap water. \n \n \n Elbridge Gerry said about the proposed conscientious objector clause:\n &#8220;I am apprehensive that this clause would give an opportunity to the people in power to destroy the constitution itself. They can declare who are the religiously scrupulous, and prevent them from bearing arms.\" \n \n And later on he is paraphrased as saying,\n \"Now, if we give a discretionary power to exclude those from militia duty who have religious scruples, we may as well make no provision on this head. For this reason, he wished the words to be altered so as to be confined to persons belonging to a religious sect scrupulous of bearing arms.\"\n Amendment II: House of Representatives, Amendments to the Constitution\n \n Notice that \"prevent them from bearing arms\" and \"exclude those from militia duty\" are used interchangeably. Gerry was afraid that such a clause would grant Congress absolute power over who was in the militia and who was not. Congress could simply claim someone was religiously scrupulous and then \"prevent them from bearing arms\". It doesn't seem likely that Gerry was worried about Congress using the conscientious objector clause to prevent people from toting guns around for their own own private purposes. He was concerned with having an effective militia which concern is later echoed by Scott who fears that \"a militia can never be depended upon\" if large numbers of people are excluded from militia duty because of the conscientious objector clause. \n\n \n I disagree. Gerry was not afraid that the proposed Amendment would grant Congress absolute power over who was in the militia and who was not. Gerry was complaining that Congress already had this power and the proposed Amendment did nothing to correct this imbalance. Your source goes on to quote him further: \n \n &#8220;Mr. Gerry objected to the first part of the clause, on account of the uncertainty with which it is expressed. A well regulated militia being the best security of a free State, admitted an idea that a standing army was a secondary one. It ought to read, \"a well regulated militia, trained to arms;\" in which case it would become the duty of the Government to provide this security, and furnish a greater certainty of its being done.&#8221; (bold emphasis added)\n \n Gerry is aware that Article I Sec. 8 gives Congress total power over the militias (save officer appointment)&#8212;and the power to chose to rely upon either a militia or its power to create a standing army. We know from other writings that Gerry passionately believed in the principle of avoiding standing armies and relying on militias. Gerry agrees that the militia preamble is a positive statement of this principle. But Gerry clearly does not like the militias being at the mercy of Congress, and he wishes to change the militia preamble to make it become more than a statement of principle and instead place an affirmative duty of government to rely upon militias. \n \n This proposed change is an admission by Gerry of what I have said earlier&#8212;that the Amendment as then written (and later adopted) does nothing to limit Congress&#8217; power over the militias&#8212;how many members, who can be a member, how they are armed, etc. This in turn makes the &#8220;militia only&#8221; RKBA a &#8220;right&#8221; that exists only at the whim of Congress. \n \n In contrast, Gerry&#8217;s proposed rewrite of the militia preamble would have been a radical transition away from the Constitution&#8217;s status quo&#8212;and would have been the \"repeal\" of a part of Article I Sec.8, a grant of power in Article I Sec 8 over the militias now amended to require a congressional duty to create and maintain an effective militia. And it is significant to me that he made this motion (which also failed) after he failed to strike the CO clause&#8212;for it puts into context his earlier argument against the CO clause. He knows when he makes his objection to the CO clause that Congress has the sole power to choose who can be excluded from a militia. Under these circumstances, If you also attach to the Constitution another statement of principle &#8220;but no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms&#8221; then you give Congress encouragement to use its unlimited power to write anyone (and as many people as) it wants out of militia service&#8212;providing Congress with a Constitutional justification for saying &#8220;we need a professional army because we think too many people are actually COs and we can&#8217;t enroll enough people to form an effective militia.&#8221; \n \n In short, Gerry is not talking about the second part of the Amendment&#8212;the individual right to keep and bear arms. He is instead focusing on the deficiency of the militia preamble to correct what he sees as the danger of absolute congressional control over the militia being coupled with language that gives Congress an excuse to use that power arbitrarily to destroy the militia. His argument is this: If you are going to allow Congress to retain the complete power to choose who can be in a militia then you had better not give Congress an excuse to exclude people from it unless you want Congress to use that excuse to destroy the militia. Or, to put it another way, since you refuse to listen to me and you want to keep the CO clause then you had better amend the militia preamble to change it from a statement of principle into a duty to force Congress to rely upon a militia&#8212;because if you don&#8217;t then there is nothing to prevent Congress from using the CO clause to declare the militia dead.\n \n In no part of this history do we see Gerry hinting that the subsequent phrase &#8220;the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed&#8221; recognized only a right to bear arms in militia service&#8212;or that the broader individual RKBA is somehow dependent upon the militia preamble or in any way under the control of Congress. And, if you turn further to Mr. Scott then you see the clear train of thought being carried further. I agree, as you have quoted, that Scott says &#8220;&#8230;&#8220;for a militia can never be depended upon.&#8221; He further agrees with Gerry that if the CO clause remains then Congress could arbitrarily declare not enough men are left to for an effective militia, and he further says &#8220;and in this case recourse must be had to a standing army.&#8221; But we cannot exclude what Scott says between your quote and mine, which is this (from your source):\n \n &#8220;&#8230;for a militia can never be depended upon. This would lead to the violation of another article in the constitution, which secures to the people the right of keeping arms, and in this case recourse must be had to a standing army.&#8221; (bold emhasis added)\n \n We talk a great deal of &#8220;bearing arms,&#8221; and when talking about COs we see both men are speaking of militia service. But, as Mr. Scott points out, the amendment is not &#8220;bear arms&#8221; but &#8220;keep and bear arms&#8221;&#8212;which recognizes the right is far greater than simply bearing arms in the discharge of the militia duty. \n \n And so I stand by my argument that Article I Sec 8 gave Congress the power over the militia sword, and that Congress has absolute power to divorce the individual RKBA from the militia duty that once depended upon it for a source of arms (and Congress has done so). I continue to argue that the Amendment did nothing to alter this balance of power despite Gerry&#8217;s arguments that it should be changed to do so. Instead, the Amendment as adopted merely stated the principle that Congress should rely upon a militia system (over the &#8220;it should be a duty of Congress&#8221; objection of Gerry), and (as Scott argues) it recognized that Congress&#8217; power over the militia did not give it power over the broader individual RKBA. \n \n I see nothing here that is inconsistent with the 2nd. Amendment recognized individual RKBA unconnected with militia service.",

   "I don't see a coherent argument here- just another one of your scams. The fact that freed slaves participated in the militia after the Civil War does not mean that the militia was not regulated by the government.\n\n \n You've conveniently ignored every single request and demand to prove that there was some law written somewhere, that gave the federal government absolute authority to regulate ALL privately owned firearms under militia guidelines. Either prove your case or give it up!\n \n Militia service was never, ever, under any circumstances, and prerequisite necessary for people to be able to legally exercise their constitutionally protected rights. And you can't prove otherwise. So until you do it's a matter of established principle in this debate that privately owned firearms couldn't be touched by the militia laws.\n \n Prove otherwise or drop it.\n \n \nYou conveniently ignore the fact that Article 1 of the Constitution supersedes what Hamilton said about the regulation of the militia.\n\n \n And you conveniently ignore the fact that there are no Supreme Court cases that support anything you say.\n \n Nowhere has it been shown, by you or anyone else, that militia service was a requirement before you could own a gun. For your argument to have any weight it would mean that anyone over 46, and anybody who was a woman, was denied the ability to own a firearm for the rest of their lives and there was absolutely nothing they could do about it.\n \n The Second Amendment isn't about a right to serve in the militia as a government owned slave.\n \n \nTotal bull. Heller considered the focus of the right to be on self defense against intruders not as a right to rebel against the federal government as happened in the Civil War.\n\n \n The Supreme Court said we have a right to own guns for any and all lawful purposes. That's the long and short of it. Defense inside the home was just the selected example, not the whole measure of the extent of the right. You lost that argument, get over it.\n \n We have a right to defend ourselves against ALL enemies, be they foreign or domestic.",

The only John Massaros I'm finding are a guitarist, a former marine, and an opera composer. None of which has written the book you're advertising.\n \n Regardless of who the author is, it doesn't matter.

And all government agents and organizations are bound by it.\n \n No matter what you or anyone else says, this matter was settled in Heller and McDonald.

A long fought battle to prove that what we've been saying for so many decades was the undeniable proof. We've succeeded. And now that we have this beachhead we're going to push harder than ever to assure that victory is permanent in nature.\n \n If you don't like that fact then feel free to move to Afghanistan, Africa, Germany, China or some other country where the government tells you what rights you can have, when you can have them, when they don't apply because it's Tuesday, and that you have to have papers to move from one area of town to another.",

There are laws and rules that we all have to abide by if we're going to live in a society. Even if you don't like them you have to abide by them. And one of those rules is that the Supreme Court has final say. If you don't like it then too bad, you're out of options. The legislature makes the laws. The courts determine the scope of the laws.

   "Lets see. On this page we have Laurence Tribe and Alan Dershowitz two Harvard Constitutional law professors, two supreme court decided cases and now we have the U.S. Senate historians saying this: \n 1982   THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS -- R E P O R T OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY UNITED STATES SENATE NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS -- SECOND SESSION\n Following the Civil War, the legislative efforts which gave us three amendments to the Constitution and our earliest civil rights acts likewise recognized the right to keep and bear arms as an existing constitutional right of the individual citizen and as a right specifically singled out as one protected by the civil rights acts and by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, against infringement by state authorities. Much of the reconstruction effort in the South had been hinged upon the creation of \"black militias\" composed of the armed and newly freed blacks, officered largely by black veterans of the Union Army. In the months after the Civil War, the existing southern governments struck at these units with the enactment of \"black codes\" which either outlawed gun ownership by blacks entirely, or imposed permit systems for them, and permitted the confiscation of firearms owned by blacks. When the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was debated members both of the Senate and the House referred to the disarmament of blacks as a major consideration.[54] Senator Trumbull cited provisions outlawing ownership of arms by blacks as among those which the Civil Rights Act would prevent;[55] Senator Sulsbury complained on the other hand that if the act were to be passed it would prevent his own state from enforcing a law banning gun ownership by individual free blacks.[56] Similar arguments were advanced during the debates over the \"anti-KKK act\"; its sponsor at one point explained that a section making it a federal crime to deprive a person of \"arms or weapons he may have in his house or possession for the defense of his person, family or property\" was \"intended to enforce the well-known constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right in the citizen to 'keep and bear arms'.\"[57] Likewise, the debates over the Fourteenth Amendment Congress frequently referred to the Second Amendment as one of the rights which it intended to guarantee against state action.[58] \n\n The 2nd Amendment was not only proposed, passed, then ratified once, but now twice! emoticon_smile\n \n The 14th Amendment kills your argument Dead! The Right to Keep and Bear Arms IS Individual and it is our Right!",

   "If anyone still doubts that the 14th Amendment was designed to stop the abuse of government and reaffirm the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, then SNORT THIS! \n \n   The Fourteenth Amendment and the Right To Keep and Bear Arms: The Intent of the Framers \n If African Americans were citizens, observed Chief Justice Taney in Dred Scott v. Sandford,[1] \"it would give to persons of the negro race ... the full liberty of speech ...; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went.\"[2] If this interpretation ignores that Articles I and II of the Bill of Rights designate the respective freedoms guaranteed therein to \"the people\" and not simply the citizens (much less a select group of orators or militia), contrariwise Dred Scott followed antebellum judicial thought in recognizing keeping and bearing arms as an individual right[3] protected from both federal and state infringement.[4] The exception to this interpretation were cases holding that the Second Amendment only protected citizens[5] from federal, not state,[6] infringement of the right to keep and bear arms, to provide judicial approval of laws disarming black freemen and slaves.\n \n &#8230;.. b. the civil rights act of 1866\n After the war was concluded, the slave codes, which limited access of blacks to land, to arms, and to the courts, began to reappear in the form of the black codes,[18] and United States legislators turned their attention to the protection of the freedmen. In support of Senate Bill No. 9, which declared as void all laws in the rebel states which recognized inequality of rights based on race, Sen. Henry Wilson (R., Mass.) explained in part: \"In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages on them....\"[19] \n (And the Gun Control Minions going into the Wicked Witch of the West&#8217;s castle, singing:  Wo Ye Wo, Gun Control! Wo Ye Wo, Gun Control!)  \n \n When Congress took up Senate Bill No. 61, which became the Civil Rights Act of 1866,[20] Sen. Lyman Trumbull (R., Ill.), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, indicated that the bill was intended to prohibit inequalities embodied in the black codes, including those provisions which \"prohibit any negro or mulatto from having fire-arms.\"[21] &#8230;. Sen. William Saulsbury (D., Del.) added: \"In my State for many years, and I presume there are similar laws in most of the southern States, there has existed a law of the State based upon and founded in its police power, which declares that free negroes shall not have the possession of firearms or ammunition. This bill proposes to take away from the States this police power....\"  The Delaware Democrat opposed the bill on this basis, anticipating a time when \"a numerous body of dangerous persons belonging to any distinct race\" endangered the state, for \"the State shall not have the power to disarm them without disarming the whole population.\"[22] .. Still, supporters of the bill were soon to contend that arms bearing was a basic right of citizenship or personhood.\n \n And Rep. Josiah B. Grinnell (R., Iowa) complained: \"A white man in Kentucky may keep a gun; if a black man buys a gun he forfeits it and pays a fine of five dollars, if presuming to keep in his possession a musket which he has carried through the war.\"[24] Yet the right of blacks to have arms existed partly as self-defense against the state militia itself, which implied that militia needs were not the only constitutional basis for the right to bear arms.\n \n &#8230;. As debate returned to the Civil Rights Bill, Rep. Henry J. Raymond (R., N.Y.) explained of the rights of citizenship: \"Make the colored man a citizen of the United States and he has every right which you or I have as citizens of the United States under the laws and Constitution of the United States.... He has a defined status; he has a country and a home; a right to defend himself and his wife and children; a right to bear arms....\"[27] Rep. Roswell Hart (R., N.Y.) further states: \"The Constitution clearly describes that to be a republican form of government for which it was expressly framed. A government ... where 'no law shall be made prohibiting a free exercise of religion;' where 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed;'....\"[28] He concluded that it was the duty of the United States to guarantee that the states have such a form of government.[29]\n Rep. Sidney Clarke (R., Kansas) &#8230;. Sir, I find in the Constitution of the United States an article which declares that \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" For myself, I shall insist that the reconstructed rebels of Mississippi respect the Constitution in their local laws....[33]\n Clarke added:\n Nearly every white man in that State that could bear arms was in the rebel ranks. Nearly all of their able-bodied colored men who could reach our lines enlisted under the old flag. Many of these brave defenders of the nation paid for the arms with which they went to battle.... The \"reconstructed\" State authorities of Mississippi were allowed to rob and disarm our veteran soldiers....[34](p.72)\n In sum, Clarke presupposed a constitutional right to keep privately held arms for protection against oppressive state militia.\n \n c. the fourteenth amendment\n The need for a more solid foundation for the protection of freedmen as well as white citizens was recognized, and the result was a significant new proposal--the Fourteenth Amendment. A chief exponent of the amendment, Sen. Jacob M. Howard (R., Mich.), referred to \"the personal rights guaranteed and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution; such as freedom of speech and of the press; ... the right to keep and bear arms....\"[35] \n George W. Julian (R., Ind.) noted that the act\n Is pronounced void by the jurists and courts of the South. Florida makes it a misdemeanor for colored men to carry weapons without a license to do so from a probate judge, and the punishment of the offense is whipping and the pillory. South Carolina has the same enactments... Cunning legislative devices are being invented in most of the States to restore slavery in fact.[37]\n \n (And the 2nd Amendment references go on, and on, and on, and on, and on!)\n \n In sum, in the understanding of Southern Democrats and Radical Republicans alike, the right to keep and bear arms, like other Bill of Rights freedoms, was made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n \n The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment and of the civil rights acts of Reconstruction, rather than predicating the right to keep and bear arms on the needs of an organized state militia, based it on the right of the people individually to possess arms for protection against any oppressive force--including racist or political violence by the militia itself or by other state agents such as sheriffs. At the same time, the militia was understood to be the whole body of the people, including blacks. In discussion concerning the Civil Rights Act of 1875, Sen. James A. Alcorn (R., Miss.) defined the militia in these terms: \"The citizens of the United States, the Posse comitatus, or the militia if you please, and the colored man composes part of these.\"[68] Every citizen, in short, was a militiaman. With the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, the right and privilege individually to keep and bear arms was protected from both state and federal infringement.[69]\n\n Galileo. Do you STILL want to steal our Inalienable Rights from us? Or do you want to admit that the Constitution Recognizes that we have an Inalienable Right to Keep and Bear Arms! It's OK. The readers of this forum already know! You can now admit it now! They know. This is public Record!",
