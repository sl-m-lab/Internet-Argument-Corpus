If you or he would read Thomas Paine's works AND some of Washington's letters to his contemporaries, et.al. you would see that he did not mention \"christianity\" or christian fairytales in any significant or positive light whatsoever.

There is a difference of opinion whether or not earlier presidents and particularly founders of the country were christians. The difference of opinion resides with the christians who try to convince others of this very important \"fact\". Dr. Lillback, along with other charlatans believes it to be very, very important to link the father of this country with christianity. Believe me, \"around 1936\" was not the first time George was called a Deist. Jerry Falwell would have spouted the same about Washington along with other fundamental preachers who were either ignorant, liars or scared. . . . \n \n Oh, about my childish ignorance on scripture. . . . .I graduated from Liberty University with a masters in counseling in Lynchburg when Falwell was alive and kicking some years ago. It's impossible to pass a test there without throwing in a few questions about the scriptures. (This certainly isn't a brag. I tell no one this. I only mention i here to let you know that some of us WERE believers at one time and just because we don't endorse the scriptures now doesn't mean that we didn't at one time.) Oh, I grew up outside of Charlottesville, home of old Thomas Jefferson... . . .did my undergrad at UVa. So, I'm not exactly ignorant. . . . .I choose not to believe as I once did.\n \n \nHere are quotes of Washington himself that speak directly to his personal beliefs and his faith. http://www.christiananswers.net/q-wall/wal-g011.html\nI didn't say he was a pagan or didn't believe in god. I stated that some earlier presidents were not Christian. Goes back to that old but wrong belief that America was founded by christians for christians and the christian belief should now be the law of the land. It just ain't true. The referenced article states \"To say that he [George Washington] was not a Christian would be to impeach his sincerity and honesty.\" No it wouldn't. It would only say that George was a thinker who believed in a god, which was not necessarily christian. You people really think you're special that everything religious has to be christian or it's Craap. Don't tell me brainwashing doesn't work. Look what happened to John McCain.\n \nAnd here is the link that offers the book \"The Sacred Fire\" which outlines George Washington's faith in a clear and concise way. http://www.providenceforum.org/Store_ProductDetail.aspx?pid=DG8cD513eFc7g20e If you would like to actually learn something that is true about his life and what he really believed.\n ditto\n \n \nAnd by the way D, the serpent in the garden was Lucifer, the fallen Archangel of Heaven, and was in no way a snake.

Therefore, according to my readings, the snake talked to Eve and convinced her to \"sin\" by eating of the fruit of the forbidden tree. (Many people believe it was an apple tree.) So, whether you're 4 or 94, the words are the same. I'm sure when the words were written they were meant for men, not children.

Believe me, \"around 1936\" was not the first time George was called a Deist. Jerry Falwell would have spouted the same about Washington along with other fundamental preachers who were either ignorant, liars or scared. . . . \n \n Oh, about my childish ignorance on scripture. . . . .I graduated from Liberty University with a masters in counseling in Lynchburg when Falwell was alive and kicking some years ago. It's impossible to pass a test there without throwing in a few questions about the scriptures. (This certainly isn't a brag. I tell no one this. I only mention i here to let you know that some of us WERE believers at one time and just because we don't endorse the scriptures now doesn't mean that we didn't at one time.) Oh, I grew up outside of Charlottesville, home of old Thomas Jefferson... . . .did my undergrad at UVa. So, I'm not exactly ignorant. . . . .I choose not to believe as I once did.\n \n I didn't say he was a pagan or didn't believe in god. I stated that some earlier presidents were not Christian. Goes back to that old but wrong belief that America was founded by christians for christians and the christian belief should now be the law of the land. It just ain't true. The referenced article states \"To say that he [George Washington] was not a Christian would be to impeach his sincerity and honesty.\" No it wouldn't. It would only say that George was a thinker who believed in a god, which was not necessarily christian. You people really think you're special that everything religious has to be christian or it's Craap. Don't tell me brainwashing doesn't work. Look what happened to John McCain.\n ditto\n \n WOW, who lit your fire? :) I've heard the story, know the plot and can only read what is in there. . . . .My understanding is that a serpent is a snake. Therefore, according to my readings, the snake talked to Eve and convinced her to \"sin\" by eating of the fruit of the forbidden tree. (Many people believe it was an apple tree.) So, whether you're 4 or 94, the words are the same. I'm sure when the words were written they were meant for men, not children. Sorry, didn't mean to embarrass myself.\n \n Okay, so the snake had legs before this. . . .whatever.\n \n Archie, take a chill pill. . . .don't get so excited. Everything is going to be alright. . . . . . .in November. emoticon_xagree\n\n \n I notice that with all of your high education and alleged access to credible historically accurate sources of information, that you didn't see fit to rebut my links with any credible links at all that PROVE from Washington's own letters or writings that he was at least a deist. From what I can gather, his modern day critics who claim he wasn't a christian, claim that because it cannot be shown that even though he attended church rigorously and with great discipline, he never took public communion. I find this conclusion to be shallow and judgmental at every level of spiritual understanding. \n \n Many believers in Christ who have ordered men into battle and saw that their orders caused untold deaths on both sides of the battle field found taking communion impossible thereafter. But not because of any lack of faith or belief in Christ on their part, but just the opposite, because of their utmost respect for the command not to partake in communion unless they have made peace with those they have offended first. It is most probable that George felt convicted that he could never make peace with those he offended as they were dead because of orders he had given in wartime.\n \n You will invariably hold this link that I am posting as evidence that you are right in your assertions regarding who George Washington was as a spiritual man, but I post it as evidence of his humble and sincere respect for the tenets regarding communion that Christ laid out. http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_remsburg/six_historic_americans/chapter_3.html\n \n This link covers his complete life:\n http://www.ipl.org/div/potus/gwashington.html",

   "As for the religious beliefs of the general population in pre and post revolutionary times, it wasn't nearly as Christian as most people think.\n \n Lynn R. Buzzard, executive director of the Christian Legal Society (a national organization of Christian lawyers) has admitted that there is little proof to support the claim that the colonial population was overwhelmingly Christian. \"Not only were a good many of the revolutionary leaders more deist than Christian,\" Buzzard wrote, \"but the actual number of church members was rather small. Perhaps as few as five percent of the populace were church members in 1776\" (Schools They Haven't Got a Prayer, Elgin, Illinois David C. Cook Publishing, 1982, p. 81). \n \n Historian Richard Hofstadter says that \"perhaps as many as ninety percent of the Americans were unchurched in 1790\" (Anti-Intellectualism in American Life, New York Alfred A. Knopf, 1974, p. 82) and goes on to say that \"mid-eighteenth century America had a smaller proportion of church members than any other nation in Christendom,\" noting that \"in 1800 [only] about one of every fifteen Americans was a church member\" (p. 89). \n \n Historian James MacGregor Burns agrees with these figures, noting that \"(t)here had been a `very wintry season' for religion every where in America after the Revolution\" (The American Experiment Vineyard of Liberty, New York Vintage Books, 1983, p. 493). He adds that \"ninety percent of the people lay outside the churches.\"\n \n Historians, who deal with facts rather than wishes, paint an entirely different picture of the religious composition of America during its formative years than the image of a nation founded on \"biblical principles\" that modern Bible fundamentalists are trying to foist upon us. \n \n Our founding fathers established a religiously neutral nation, and a tragedy of our time is that so many people are striving to undo all that was accomplished by the wisdom of the founding fathers who framed for us a constitution that would protect the religious freedom of everyone regardless of personal creed. An even greater tragedy is that they many times hoodwink the public into believing that they are only trying to make our nation what the founding fathers would want it to be. Separation of church and state is what the founding fathers wanted for the nation, and we must never allow anyone to distort history to make it appear otherwise. \n Here is more on the subject.

That's why people like me mourn the FACT that 40+ MILLION unborn babies have been MURDERED in a MASS GENOCIDE over the past 35 years since Roe V Wade was passed.

But you don't seem to have any problem gambling with the one life these aborted babies have though, huh?
