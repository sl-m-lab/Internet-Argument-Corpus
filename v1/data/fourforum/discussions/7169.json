   "I wanted to carry on a discussion begun in another thread. I thought it would be better to start a new thread instead of filling up the other with an off-topic tangent. For the sake of convienience, I will post links to the all the posts in the discussion so far.\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=187117&postcount=11\n http://4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=187139&postcount=12\n http://4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=187428&postcount=21\n \n My response will be to third link listed.\n \n \nI have no problem with the mother as person, she has been born and is a living, thinking, active \"person.\"\n\n This is still confusing to me because on the one hand, you have said you do not know what a person is (when referring to the fetus), and on the other you have said you do know what a person is (when referring to the mother). These two claims are mutually exclusive.\n \n You have no problem with labeling the mother a person because she is in her essence a person, that is, intrinsically she posesses what is necessary to be termed a person. But in order to say this, one must know what a person is. So what is it that makes the mother a person?\n \n \nA just born baby is a person, based on the Constitution (14th Amendment, all persons born, etc).\n\n First of all, the 14th Amendment does not establish what a person is. It establishes what a citizen is.\n \n Second of all, prior to the ratification of the 14th Amendment, infants were persons. And even after the ratification of the 14th Amendment, foreign infants are persons as well.\n \n I guess what I am wanting are some concrete qualities that are necessary for an entity to be a person, as I suggested above.\n \n \nBut before that? I don't know, I don't have to decide as I will not be pregnant in the future. But in the \"olden days\" quickening was probably the determining factor. That is when most women knew for sure that they were pregnant with no doubt.\n\n I would just say here that, though you may never be pregnant, I think this question can be vitally important.\n \n \n[1]I can't judge women who decide their fetus is not a person at the time of abortion. I do know that first trimester is a \"no-brainer\" for me as far as the legality for abortion. Second trimester is probably okay and the third is not in my view. However, the third trimester should not be a deterent if the health of the mother is at issue. She's most important or the rest of the family will not survive.\n\n Here you go even farther than you have above. Now, you know that a fetus up until a certain time period is not a person. You here assert, then, that you do know what a person is since you know that a first trimester fetus isn't one. Then you say maybe in the second trimester, effectively saying the exact opposite of what you said prior to this. Then you switch back again for the third trimester. What is the basis for this back-and-forth movement between saying you know what a person is, and that you don't know what a person is?\n \n Michele, I welcome your thoughts on any of this. If I have not been clear in what I am trying to say, please let me know and I'll try to clarify. This discussion turns out to be about the fundamental premise of the vast majority of both the pro-life and pro-choice positions. It is a discussion about personhood. I will say now that the chances are that neither you nor I will be persuaded to change our position on personhood. A discussion of this nature usually elicits responses such as \"that's been debated for years and never resolved. What's the point of discussing it?\" Yet I think a respecful discussion of this nature would be beneficial to both sides of the debate. Perhaps you can help me better understand your position, and maybe I can help you better understand mine. So with that, I welcome your response.",
