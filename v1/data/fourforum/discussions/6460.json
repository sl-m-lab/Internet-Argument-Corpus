This practice has nothing to do with Islam. It was a form of punishment in pre-Islamic times and unfortunately the fundamentalists have incorporated it into their so-called Islamic law. In the time that they used to bury their new born daughters because having a daughter was a shame, Mohammad would put his 6 year old daughter (Fatemeh) on his shoulders and would walk in the streets. With this he wanted to show something to the world. At that fundamental time he could come and say women is equal to men, he said the inheritance of a woman is half of a man's, but that was a for that era. And these are the things that the mullahs are using. Beyond the precepts and rules relevant only within a certain time-frame, we must understand the spirit of Islam and the genuine outlook of the Quran. The precepts must not be interpreted as unalterable dogmas; as circumstances change, they must be replaced with new precepts more compatible with Islam's ideal society. This is the dynamism of the Quran and of an ideology which claims to respond to the problems and needs of humankind and society in any circumstances. When this dynamism is overlooked, it inevitably leads to retrogression, oppression and discrimination emerging under the cloak of Islam. \n When a couple of men attacked a christian women, when Ali (the first Imam of the muslim, also Mohamad's cousin) heard of this he said if a muslim man hears this and doesn't cry because of this tradegy he should die of shame. With this I am answering your questions. \n \n Take care,",

I have taken issue with posters who link Islam with terrorism, but my knowledge is limited (see European Politics and Economics forum).\n Dono\n\n \n \n \n thanx, I definitley will.\n I have to say that in the time of Mohammad, the women had many parts in the war against the enemies, and I don't mean behind the scene, I think this shows very much how Mohammad believed in equality. Nurturing of a generation of pioneering women was one of the most important achievements of Muhammad from the time he was chosen as the Prophet until his passing 23 years later. \n \n Historical sources have recorded the names of more than 600 women who were called those who pledged allegiance to the Prophet. These women came from different strata of society, from the wealthy Quriash tribe to women slaves. By relying on the teachings and guidance of Prophet, they were able to take on the most difficult responsibilities during places of exile, at the battle grounds and more importantly in political and social arenas.\n According to Quran, verse 12 of Chapter Al-Mumtahina - She That Is to Be Examined3) these pioneering women, independently and without any tribal or family affiliation with men, had made commitment not to leave prophet alone in any activity that was on the movement's agenda.\n These women pledged allegiance to the Prophet during several important turning points. The leading woman in the list was Khadija, who had earlier married the Prophet and was the first woman to accept Islam.\n \n The first Muslim killed under torture was a woman slave named \"Sommaya.\" She was in her sixties. \n \n But these things are never mentioned by the fundamentalism and unfortunately they stay unknown.
