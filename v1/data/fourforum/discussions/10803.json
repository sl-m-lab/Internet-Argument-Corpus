   "\"We all ought to understand we're on our own. Believing in Santa Claus doesn't do kids any harm for a few years but it isn't smart for them to continue waiting all their lives for him to come down the chimney with something wonderful. Santa Claus and God are cousins.\n \n Christians talk as though goodness was their idea but good behavior doesn't have any religious origin. Our prisons are filled with the devout.\n \n I'd be more willing to accept religion, even if I didn't believe it, if I thought it made people nicer to each other but I don't think it does.\"\n -- Andy Rooney, Sincerely, Andy Rooney, 1999.
