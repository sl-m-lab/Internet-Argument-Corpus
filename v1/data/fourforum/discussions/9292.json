Did John Kerry vote \"for\" action or did he not?\n How did Hillary Clinton vote? \n What I do not support is pulling out of Iraq and abandoning the Iraqi people because of the political asperations of a party that has only criticism and no solutions. Solutions that \"must\" include maintaining the democratic system created in Iraq. I am not incapable of supporting a Democrat. But I am waiting on just one to offer something other than criticism for a glimpse at the future.",

   "At this point in time, you're disagreeing with a fair size of both the left and the right when you say the Iraq War was justified. This discussion has nothing to do with the viewpoints of politicians, though. What we have are a multitude of facts and testimony that say the war was a bad idea and that it's failing. As of late, you haven't even attempted to repudiate them.\n\n \n \n I've never allowed majorities or the idea of being popular to be a factor in what I believe. The media who controls the information with which most people base their opinions on have presented only the negatives of the events and progress in the country of Iraq. \n There are many excellent things happening that get -0- press. \n I don't struggle much with \"why\". \n I have a nephew and his wife in Iraq. They have yahoo messenger and we discuss many things. I also have an Iraqi friend who lives in Basrah. He is Shiite. He appreciates the absence of Hussien and that he voted for the existing government. A government who was not President Bush's hoped for leadership. Freedom is not easy. Harder when you have an enemy without honor. One who hides among the people they would rule and strikes the unexpecting. This type of enemy can only win playing on the fears of people.\n Are you afraid? Do we let them win? I say no. Much blood has spilled. Iraqis vote. All American casualties have been volunteers. The price of quitting will be too high.",
