   "at Sparks. I do prefer those at The Palms. The Four Seasons is VERY expensive, but WORTH IT!\n \n Kofi Annan is a cold hearted elitist. The man comes from a country where the average income is under $160.00 a month. He spends twice that much for dinner, at NYC's most trendy restaurants, three times a week!\n \n He lives as a millionaire as thousands of children,children!, starve in his homeland. This man dined at fancy restaurants, while three genocides occured. This man \"lived the good life\" while tens of thousands of people were starved, tortured and hacked to death. All this while his \"United Nations\" did NOTHING. \n \n Don't quote this lowlife to me. He has no moral standing to judge the USA or any country.",
