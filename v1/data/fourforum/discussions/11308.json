   "Article published Saturday, June 14, 2008\n Dilemma of shooting first\n \n THERE are many reasons to like Gov. Ted Strickland. His position on National Rifle Association-backed attempts to create an armed society is not one of them. \n \n This week, the governor unwisely signed into law a bill that weakens concealed-carry laws, declares open season on intruders, and unreasonably restricts the property rights of landlords. The bill, opposed by the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association and many police groups, breezed through a House and Senate eager to begin summer recess and concerned about offending the gun lobby in an election year. \n \n The law, which will take effect in about three months, establishes in Ohio what is known as the \"Castle Doctrine,\" or the principle that people in their own homes ought to be able to protect themselves or a third party with deadly force against intruders. That seems a reasonable position. \n \n But Ohio's law goes further in three ways. It removes the requirement that the person in danger retreat if possible, encouraging victims to shoot first and ask questions later. Second, it shifts the burden to prosecutors to prove a shooting was not self-defense, making it easier for bad guys to literally get away with murder. And third, it extends the protection to vehicles as well as residences, which, when coupled with watered-down concealed-carry provisions, increases the likelihood of violence there as well. \n \n In essence, the law gives homeowners and motorists the right to blow away anyone who enters their home or vehicle without permission. \n \n More troubling, however, are changes the law makes to previous rules governing weapons in motor vehicles. Current state law requires motorists to transport their unloaded guns in a locked trunk or a case. The new law allows legal gun owners with a concealed-carry permit to transport their unloaded weapons in an unlocked glove box or center console, with ammunition close by. The only possible purpose for this change is to make lethal force more readily available to drivers. \n \n A third provision in the law prohibits landlords from forbidding tenants to have guns in their rental units. This is a serious infringement of a landlord's property rights. Tenants have the right to choose where they live, but they do so in full knowledge of the restrictions a landlord may place on the accommodation. Those have included such rules as no pets, no painting or nailing the walls, noise restrictions, and, until this law goes into effect, no weapons on the premises. It makes no sense that while landlords can prohibit pets, soon they will not be able to outlaw guns on their properties. \n \n For the NRA, the answer to society's ills is to put more guns into the hands of more people. \n \n It is unfortunate that Governor Strickland chose to listen to it rather than to state prosecutors and many of its chief law-and-order organizations on this issue. \n http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080614/OPINION02/806140315/-1/OPINION",

   "Wow. More emotionally drive #### from the anti gun folks. \n \n Castle doctrine has been adopted in most states now...if anything Ohio is late to the game. The duty to retreat has also been removed in most states...it has led to too many people being shot in the back. \n \n The truth of the matter is that despite the fact that the vast majority of states now allow concealed carry, have adopted castle doctrine, and have removed the retreat provisions at least in your home, and crime has not gone up. We have not seen the wild west type shootouts the antis warned us about and the fantasy world that they live in that has gun owners blowing people away in their homes and using castle doctrine as an excuse has, fortunately, not bled into the reality that we inhabit.\n \n As far as the landlords property rights...is this a joke??? Landlords are able to have rules like \"no holes in the walls\" and \"no pets\" because those things cause damage to the residence. When you rent a property it becomes your \"home\". A landlord can no more tell you you cannot own a gun any more than they could provide consent to the police for a search against your will.",

   "emoticon_xkill \n \n \nA. Guns save more lives than they take; prevent more injuries than they inflict \n \n * Guns used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2 \n * Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker.3 \n * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse.4 \n * Even anti-gun Clinton researchers concede that guns are used 1.5 million times annually for self-defense. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are as many as 1.5 million cases of self-defense every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of \"Guns in America\" -- a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig.5 \n * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606).6 And readers of Newsweek learned that \"only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The 'error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high.\"7 \n * Handguns are the weapon of choice for self-defense. Citizens use handguns to protect themselves over 1.9 million times a year.8 Many of these self-defense handguns could be labeled as \"Saturday Night Specials.\" \n B. Concealed carry laws help reduce crime\n \n * Nationwide: one-half million self-defense uses. Every year, as many as one-half million citizens defend themselves with a firearm away from home.9 \n * Concealed carry laws are dropping crime rates across the country. A comprehensive national study determined in 1996 that violent crime fell after states made it legal to carry concealed firearms. The results of the study showed: \n * States which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%;10 and \n * If those states not having concealed carry laws had adopted such laws in 1992, then approximately 1,570 murders, 4,177 rapes, 60,000 aggravated assaults and over 11,000 robberies would have been avoided yearly.11 \n * Vermont: one of the safest five states in the country. In Vermont, citizens can carry a firearm without getting permission... without paying a fee... or without going through any kind of government-imposed waiting period. And yet for ten years in a row, Vermont has remained one of the top-five, safest states in the union -- having three times received the \"Safest State Award.\"12 \n * Florida: concealed carry helps slash the murder rates in the state. In the fifteen years following the passage of Florida's concealed carry law in 1987, over 800,000 permits to carry firearms were issued to people in the state.13 FBI reports show that the homicide rate in Florida, which in 1987 was much higher than the national average, fell 52% during that 15-year period -- thus putting the Florida rate below the national average. 14 \n * Do firearms carry laws result in chaos? No. Consider the case of Florida. A citizen in the Sunshine State is far more likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder. \n 1. During the first fifteen years that the Florida law was in effect, alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 229 to 155 margin. \n 2. And even the 155 \"crimes\" committed by concealed carry permit holders are somewhat misleading as most of these infractions resulted from Floridians who accidentally carried their firearms into restricted areas, such as an airport.15 \n C. Criminals avoid armed citizens \n \n * Kennesaw, GA. In 1982, this suburb of Atlanta passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in the house. The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89% in Kennesaw, compared to the modest 10.4% drop in Georgia as a whole.16 \n * Ten years later (1991), the residential burglary rate in Kennesaw was still 72% lower than it had been in 1981, before the law was passed.17 \n * Nationwide. Statistical comparisons with other countries show that burglars in the United States are far less apt to enter an occupied home than their foreign counterparts who live in countries where fewer civilians own firearms. Consider the following rates showing how often a homeowner is present when a burglar strikes: \n * Homeowner occupancy rate in the gun control countries of Great Britain, Canada and Netherlands: 45% (average of the three countries); and, \n * Homeowner occupancy rate in the United States: 12.7%.18 \n Rapes averted when women carry or use firearms for protection \n * Orlando, FL. In 1966-67, the media highly publicized a safety course which taught Orlando women how to use guns. The result: Orlando's rape rate dropped 88% in 1967, whereas the rape rate remained constant in the rest of Florida and the nation.19 \n * Nationwide. In 1979, the Carter Justice Department found that of more than 32,000 attempted rapes, 32% were actually committed. But when a woman was armed with a gun or knife, only 3% of the attempted rapes were actually successful.20 \n Justice Department study: \n * 3/5 of felons polled agreed that \"a criminal is not going to mess around with a victim he knows is armed with a gun.\"21 \n * 74% of felons polled agreed that \"one reason burglars avoid houses when people are at home is that they fear being shot during the crime.\"22 \n * 57% of felons polled agreed that \"criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\"23 \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1 Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, \"Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense With a Gun,\" 86 The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, Northwestern University School of Law, 1 (Fall 1995):164. \n Dr. Kleck is a professor in the school of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University in Tallahassee. He has researched extensively and published several essays on the gun control issue. His book, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America, has become a widely cited source in the gun control debate. In fact, this book earned Dr. Kleck the prestigious American Society of Criminology Michael J. Hindelang award for 1993. This award is given for the book published in the past two to three years that makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology. \n Even those who don't like the conclusions Dr. Kleck reaches, cannot argue with his impeccable research and methodology. In \"A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,\" Marvin E. Wolfgang writes that, \"What troubles me is the article by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. The reason I am troubled is that they have provided an almost clear-cut case of methodologically sound research in support of something I have theoretically opposed for years, namely, the use of a gun in defense against a criminal perpetrator.... I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution expressed in this article and this research. Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime? It is hard to believe. Yet, it is hard to challenge the data collected. We do not have contrary evidence.\" Wolfgang, \"A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,\" The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, at 188. \n Wolfgang says there is no \"contrary evidence.\" Indeed, there are more than a dozen national polls -- one of which was conducted by The Los Angeles Times -- that have found figures comparable to the Kleck-Gertz study. Even the Clinton Justice Department (through the National Institute of Justice) found there were as many as 1.5 million defensive users of firearms every year. See National Institute of Justice, \"Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms,\" Research in Brief (May 1997). \n As for Dr. Kleck, readers of his materials may be interested to know that he is a member of the ACLU, Amnesty International USA, and Common Cause. He is not and has never been a member of or contributor to any advocacy group on either side of the gun control debate. \n 2 According to the National Safety Council, the total number of gun deaths (by accidents, suicides and homicides) account for less than 30,000 deaths per year. See Injury Facts, published yearly by the National Safety Council, Itasca, Illinois. \n 3Kleck and Gertz, \"Armed Resistance to Crime,\" at 173, 185. \n 4Kleck and Gertz, \"Armed Resistance to Crime,\" at 185. \n 5 Philip J. Cook and Jens Ludwig, \"Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms,\" NIJ Research in Brief (May 1997); available at http://www.ncjrs.org/txtfiles/165476.txt on the internet. The finding of 1.5 million yearly self-defense cases did not sit well with the anti-gun bias of the study's authors, who attempted to explain why there could not possibly be one and a half million cases of self-defense every year. Nevertheless, the 1.5 million figure is consistent with a mountain of independent surveys showing similar figures. The sponsors of these studies -- nearly a dozen -- are quite varied, and include anti-gun organizations, news media organizations, governments and commercial polling firms.

   "Well let's face it, Rox's argument was better than yours, more grounded in reality.

Let me ask all you anti gun people a question. The question is- You and your family go to a resteraunt for a meal,you are sitting there enjoying the day when all the sudden a pickup crashes through the window of your resteraunt and a man gets out and starts shooting people for no reason and no one in the resteraunt has a gun,what do you do? If you have a cell phone you dial 911 but how many people are going to die before the police get there,and when the police do get there now you have a hostage situation. What do you do now? Do you tell the man about your precious gun laws and gun control measures? I seriously doubt that will do you any good,in fact you will probably get shot for your efforts. So again i ask what do you do. Answer is you can do nothing but try to survive the ordeal. This happened at a Lubys cafateria in Texas in 1991.I think 28 or so died before it was over. A lady named Suzanna Hupp was there with her parents,she survived but her parents did not. She is now one of the biggest supporters of the right to carry laws being passed.She also represented Texas in some form of the Government. This is what i have to say about what you have just read,if someone in that resteraunt had had a gun that day no where near as many people would have lost their lives.",

   "You can't come up with these erroneous conclusions with your (very wanting) mathematical skills! Hmm... your termonology irritates me. You anti-gun nuts have no mathematical skills!\n \n The 5% doesn't change.\n\n You are correct about one thing. The 50% over 10 years is incorrect, though why you would want to generalise about a whole section of society and their mathematical skills is beyond me. Especially given your statement that the 5% doesn't change, which is also incorrect.\n \n If the probability that a gun is used in a crime is 5% in any given year (meaning 95% that it is not used in a crime in that year), then the probability that it will be used in a crime over a two year period is 9.75% (1 - 0.95^2). Over a 3 year period it is 14.3%\n \n \n\n Years Use in Crime\n 1 5.00%\n 2 9.75%\n 3 14.26%\n 4 18.55%\n 5 22.62%\n 6 26.49%\n 7 30.17%\n 8 33.66%\n 9 36.98%\n 10 40.13%\n \n\n See how the 5% changes depending on how many years you are looking at?\n \n Do you understand these figures, or would you like an irritating anti-gun nut, whose mathematical skills are obviously wanting, to explain them to you?\n \n By the way, if all this \"gun-nuts stuff\" is making you sick, you are not being forced to read it.\n \n Smiley",

   "I pride myself on being a very responsible gun owner.I keep my guns where kids cant get to them,I only shoot them when hunting or at a gun range.Now there is only so much that anyone can do about anything.I can have a 1,000,000,000 dollar gun safe installed in my home and if someone wants whats inside bad enough they will figure out how to do it.Same as i could buy a very expensive European supercar and no matter how much i might try to keep someone from stealing it,fact is if they want it bad enough there going to get it.So no i cant say for sure that my home wont be broken into and all my guns get stollen and then used to commit crimes,but what I can say for sure is that only a very small percentage of law biding gun owners ever has or ever will use their guns in a crime.If you anti gun people want less crime and murders in this country,quit trying to get more gun control pushed off on us good guys,quit comparing us to those that do evil and start concentrating on the guns that are imported into America illegally because thats where most of the criminals are getting them.",
