   "YouTube -Ban Assault Clips\n\n \n You're still not making a sufficient case for your argument. Why do you believe that nobody should be allowed to own magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition? I've seen no legitimate reason for why magazines above a certain size should be banned from legal ownership.\n \n Why do we need magazines that hold amounts of ammunition greater than 10 rounds? Why do we not simply settle for lots of 10 round magazines and call it good enough?\n \n This is the simple answer to the question. Because there's no legally justifiable reason for restricting them in the civilian market. For all of the heated rhetoric and opinions that have been offered up by various politicians and political activists, nobody has introduced an argument as to why we simply shouldn't be allowed to have them. Maybe we don't have a need for them, but you haven't been able to show that we have no purpose owning them in the first place.\n \n The only response ever given is that criminals use them. That's not even a proper answer. Criminals use everything whether it's legal or not. They'll use whatever they can get their hands on. Simply because a criminal uses something for illegal activity isn't grounds for taking it away from us.\n \n Should I provide a list of the various things that have been misused by criminals for illegal purposes? If we applied the logic of gun control to other items that are frequently abused and used for the purpose of crime, there would be a great many things that should be either banned or tightly restricted.",

Did you notice the guy's stance, how he sighted the gun, the position of his eyes, the way he actually held the gun in his hands, how little actual muzzle flip was going on while he fired it? The entire thing was completely staged.\n \n This guy was obviously paid to just fire as fast as he possibly could, accuracy be damned. He's not an active practicing shooter but rather a gun control mook.\n \n I've never shot at an indoor range myself, but I do know they have rules against rapid fire taking place on their facilities.\n \n Take a look at the muzzle flash. It seems quite exaggerated to me. It looks like it's computer enhanced just like you see on movies.\n \n And look at how little muzzle flip is taking place. Anybody who's fired a Glock pistol in 9mm knows that isn't real. Watch the tension in his arms under his shirt, he's faking the recoil. The gun has been modified to fire blank ammunition, which explains the lack of recoil and the unnatural appearance of the spent brass landing at his feet.\n \n What we're seeing here is a case of creative editing. We've got the mook doing his best to imitate Hollywood shooting, and then we've got the target in question being shot with holes in an entirely different clip, which has been sped up to suggest rapid firing can be done in an accurate (but highly unrealistic) manner.",

But I certainly believe the Founding Fathers didn't intend for any centralized federal government to have the authority to supersede the authority of the people and elect itself king by denying the people the ability to have final say on the matter should tyranny ever set in.\n \n Back in 1976 Washington DC enacted a law stating that anyone who wished to legally own a handgun must register it with the city and obtain a permit to own it.

Congress has not been delegated the power to create gun laws in the first place. Then there was the Supreme Court who thumbed their noses at the American people by inventing the scam of incorporation, after they passed the 14th Amendment, so they did not have to do what they were supposed to do, by law. Now the question is, what did they do about it? They passed the 14th and still got stuffed!!! What will we, do?

I'm open for a better suggestion. emoticon_smile\n \n \n and illegal is illegal. \n \n Aye the rub. Gun owners are usually law-abiding people who want to do what is good, and what it right. That is our nature. \n \n Then there is the jail that goes with illegal is illegal, and people who don't mind throwing otherwise law abiding people in it.

   "When the Revolution started we were offered this insight.   The Declaration of Independence \n When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\n\n Galileo was correct about this part, our government under the Articles of Confederation had too little power, and nothing got done. \n \n The Federalist said, well, we have this absolutely binding contract that only We the People can amend, (this system of government,) all figured out. Just sign on the dotted line. Our founding fathers distrusted government, even the one they were in the process of creating. The Anti-Federalist said, Oh it is a nice contract, I see you put a lot of work into it. But, no thanks. We had enough with governments going rogue, usurping power, and or encroachments of power and so forth. So the Federalist went about trying to sell, and explain the new contract to We the People through a series of essays called the Federalist papers. \n \n The historians at our Nations archives says this.   The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n Alexander Hamilton 1775\n The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment, or musty records. They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. \n __________________________________________________________________________________\n \n Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to a fair and speedy trial&#8211;the ringing phrases that inventory some of Americans' most treasured personal freedoms&#8211;were not initially part of the U.S. Constitution. At the Constitutional Convention, the proposal to include a bill of rights was considered and defeated. The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution as the first ten amendments on December 15, 1791.\n \n The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights. \n \n Hamilton fired back with this. \n  Alexander Hamilton-- Federalist Papers no. 84 \n I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\"\n\n The Anti-Federalist said, Humm. Good point. But insisted on the guarantee that under this absolutely binding contract, that they had an absolute guarantee that the government possessed no rights and no powers to act in certain areas. And the BoR was born, and the solution was to add the 9th & 10th Amendments, to deal with Hamilton's point.\n \n   9th Amendment \n  The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.  \n \n Rights Retained by the People -- Annotations \n Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those.\n\n  10th Amendment \n The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n \n But what did our founders believe, and how do they establish what was a right and what was not, in their own minds. Some of it is in the Declaration of Independence, up top. But here is a further explanation. \n \n   From the Constitution Society \n There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the \"right to keep and bear arms\". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. \n \n (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea.\n \n (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution. \n \n \n   Preamble Bill of Rights \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution \n\n \n Something President Obama calls a list of negative Rights against government. \n \n Like the good doctor says, the Constitution lays out what powers are delegated to the government. They have no other legal authority than that. If We the People want them to have more, we can use Article 5 to give it to them. \n \n The constitution was written to limit the power of gov't and to ensure all rights to the people. Government does not possess 'rights' but 'enumerated powers' and only those enumerated. The theory that gov't possess 'rights' and then can curtail or ration those rights to the people as they deem necessary for their own security is ludicrous to say the least! Indeed, it is the citizen's duty to aid the police and not the other way around. Each citizen is charged with the \"preservation\" of the Constitution and individual police power to promote and defend the Constitution, himself, and the legitimate powers of the State.\n\n I say all of the tools are there, if everyone obeys the absolutely binding contract.
