The Franken Amendment only deals with CIVIL LAWSUITS. Rape, last time I checked, was a CRIMINAL offense, so agreeing to binding arbitration in CIVIL matters does not apply. Your introduction of a red herring notwithstanding. \n \n \nI've always thought that if you rape someone you should not be taken to civil court. You should be in prison learning how it feels.\n\n \n Companies with American employees operating in the ME pay big bucks to ex-pats. In return, they agree to not sue the company for sexual harassment, but DO NOT wave their rights to file criminal charges. The reasoning, I assume, is that in Muslim countries, women are normally treated as second class citizens culturally, so the companies try to insulate themselves against American women, used to equal treatment in the US, being discriminated against in the ME. IMO, it's a reasonable attempt. Any woman objecting to the fact that they will be looked upon as second class citizens there doesn't have to take the job in the ME in the first place.\n Now what happened in this instance doesn't fall under that scenario. There was clearly an obstruction of justice committed. The question is whether or not it was done with the company's knowledge, consent or passive approval. If it was, then the company should be charged criminally.",

You should be in prison learning how it feels.\n\n \n \n The problem is that the defense contractors are overseas, and because of the loop holes in the laws, they can't be prosecuted in the U.S. \n \n This was inspired by the multiple instances of co-workers raping female contractors in KBR.\n \n From Franken&#39;s Anti-Rape Amendment\n \n \n In April of 2008, KBR employee Dawn Leamon went public. A few months earlier, she had been raped and sexually assaulted by co-workers while deployed at Camp Harper, in Iraq, and after weeks of being pressured not to report the incident, forced to work alongside her attackers, and medically neglected, Leamon brought the story to a Houston attorney and to The Nation. Leamon joined a slowly building chorus of female defense contractor employees who'd been raped or sexually assaulted by co-workers while in Iraq, to utter impunity on the part of their assailants. In response, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee called a hearing to investigate why the Justice Department had not prosecuted any sexual assault allegations in Iraq since the going to war in the country.\n \n When it turned out that defense contractors often required employees, as a condition of employment, to submit to binding private arbitration in disputes with the contractors (including allegations of sexual assault), instead of bringing complaints to public courts, and that the Department of Defense claimed they couldn't prosecute for this very reason (even though these clauses only prevented civil suits), Senator Ben Nelson, who called the hearing, offered a simple solution: \"This might be something you want to require and include in your contracts--before you award them,\" Karen Houppert reported in The Nation.\n \n Freshman Sen. Al Franken took Nelson's suggestion seriously, and has pushed through an amendment to a Defense Appropriations bill that would prevent the Pentagon from doing business with contractors who force employees into binding arbitration over rape and sexual assault charges. (As Jon Stewart put it, \"How is that a loophole that needs closing?\"\n ",
