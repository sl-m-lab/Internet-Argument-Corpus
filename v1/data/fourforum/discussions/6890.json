   "I stopped posting a while back because sudden demands in my life prevented me from having time, and I simply cannot keep a debate alive here for that reason. But, I would like to offer a fresh little read for everyone in this forum. It does not speak of abortion in particular, but I believe that it applies to this forum because of the outlook on life that many here have adopted, be they pro-life or pro-choice. Please consider reading this book, which can be found on-line here: \n \n http://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/orthodoxy.i.html\n \n It is written mostly as a train-of-thought, and is a staunch atheist philosopher's story of how he came to be a Christian. His own brief preface explains this. Before you sigh, roll your eyes, or bang your fist on the desk, please understand that it is written in a very artistic (and brilliant) manner, regardless of whether or not you agree with it. It offers a fresh perspective, when many here (and elsewhere) have come to have what I might go so far as to call an unnatural perspective. I do not mean this as an attack, or proof of anything, just as a good read from which you can take what you want. And it is not that long (certainly no novel). If you do read it, please read at least the first three chapters before you decide if you want to finish it or not, and please do not \"skim\" it, because it is often a difficult read and should be read as such to be understood. Thank you.\n \n P.S. - While you read it, I suggest you have a database like Wikipedia open, so that you can look up descriptions of philosophies, words, and other things you don't know. It makes it a much more enjoyable read.",
