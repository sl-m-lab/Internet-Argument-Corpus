A modern inexpensive duty shot gun can be about 200-250 dollars.\n \n If the government just paid $100 dollars for every firearm, that would be = 20 BILLION dollars.\n \n Anyone still think a gun buy back is a good idea?",

A product of this type can be used to deny access to areas or to cover a unit's flank.\n -- Sticky foam: Extremely adhesive foam that immobilizes individuals. This foam can be used to subdue an individual or reinforce obstacles.\n -- Infrasound: Low-frequency sound generators that incapacitate individuals by causing nausea, disorientation and bowel spasms.\n -- Microwave transmitters: Directionally oriented devices that heat skin to an unbearable degree as people approach them.\n -- Lasers: Personnel-portable and vehicle-mounted flashers designed to dazzle but not permanently injure eyes.\n -- Electrical shockers: Stand-off, hand-launched, electrical shock projectiles.\n -- Pyrotechnics: Rapid-bloom smoke grenades and enhanced smoke grenades.\n -- Vortex weapons: The vortex gun fires a doughnut-shaped shock wave, powerful enough to knock people down. The gun can also be filled with a riot-control agent such as pepper spray that disperses a chemical irritant as well as knocks a person down.\n \n \n \n http://www.washtimes.com/upi-breaking/20021030-063607-9176r.htm",
