It's mostly just terminology anti-war nuts like to use when they are biased against a president.\n\n \n WRONG. That is the entire point of treaty law. That is the foundation of the WHO, the UN, the WTO, Nato, every international treaty out there. While it is true that there is no over arching government to enforce it, unlike most contract law they build an enforcement scheme directly into the treaty itself. \n \n The WTO is a good example. Members of the WTO have to agree to a treaty that sets forth the terms of the organization. Within the treaty is the remedy for violation of terms which can include fines, retaliatory tariffs, and even embargoes. All member nations agree to participate in the enforcement of the treaty.\n \n The UN is another easy example. We signed a treaty to become a UN member...all the nations did. Included in that treaty are terms that we are required to meet. If we fail to fulfill our obligations or undertake actions that are prohibited by our treaty there is about 40 pages of potential consequences from fines to trade embargoes to military action. \n \n In the case of the UN and WTO ( and I am sure others as well) they go even further and require that the treaty be ratified by the legislative branch of the member government and codified in the nations laws. \n \n In the US this is automatic due to the supremacy clause in the constitution:\n \n \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding\n\n \n Our constitution LITERALLY places the treaties we sign at the same level as the constitution itself as supreme law of the land. They cannot be superseded by federal, state, or local law and you can be found criminally liable, in a US court, for violating a treaty that the US has signed. \n \n International law and treaty obligations are why even nations that disagreed with the first gulf war (Under Bush Sr) helped pay for it. They were bound to by treaty. It is also why no nation on the planet dared help Iraq...what we were doing was legal under international law and the penalties for opposing our actions were more than anybody was willing to bear. Fast forward to the second Iraq war (Shrubs war) and things are VASTLY different. We ended up footing 100% of the cost of the war. We have evidence that not only were several other nations in the region helping Iraqis oppose us, but that the Chinese, S Koreans, Spanish, and Russians were all doing business with the Iraqis while we were fighting them. We had NO recourse since what we were doing was not legal. If it HAD been, they would have been prohibited from trading with the enemy. \n \n If you are going to pretend that international law does not exist, you need to move somewhere that it is not codified in the constitution of wherever you live. It is going to be a third world nation, though, because in EVERY first world nation, international treaties have the force of law once ratified. It is part of how you become a first world nation...you cannot be a first world nation without international trade, and you cannot have international trade unless the people you are dealing with have some kind of assurance that you are actually bound to your word. \n \n In the US, not only can you bring suit against somebody for a treaty violation in a court, you can be criminally charged for a treaty violation. \n \n YES....George Bush could have been tried criminally in a US court for violating international law when we invaded Iraq....though it is unlikely since, as president, not only could he pardon himself, he controlled the justice department.\n \n YES...if Obama had not bombed Libya, he could have been charged with a felony in US courts for failing to uphold our treaty obligations to the UN....though unlikely for the same reason as above. \n \n YES, the idea that there was more international support for the invasion of Iraq than there is for the no fly zone/protection zone in Libya is absolutely retarded and shows a complete and utter lack of knowledge. Obamas attacks on Libya are the result of us fulfilling our treaty obligations with the UN after the security council approved the attacks. 118 member nations of the UN have agreed to help pay for the operation (there are only 192 member nations) including China and Russia, which abstained from the security council vote. \n \n For the war in Iraq, ZERO nations agreed to help pay for the operation, after aggression against Iraq failed to pass the security council THREE times. There is no possible way that you could come to the conclusion that there was more international support for the war in Iraq than there was for the Libyan strikes unless you had no knowledge of the facts whatsoever. \n \n So, NO, the liberals are not being hypocrites. \n \n YES, the CINOs are acting like complete and utter XXXXXX by trying to compare the two.\n \n YES, the actual conservatives have more important things on their mind, though are likely to support the strikes on the principal that we helped him oppress the people over the last few years (due to a desperate and stupid move by the CINO in chief) and we have an obligation to repair the damage we did.",

Basically both sides pulled out the \"humanitarian\" card when it suited them best.\n\n \n What strikes me as hypocritical is not the action against libya, but rather the fact that when the Saudis basically threatened to wipe out the families of anybody who showed up to protest against the house of Saud, we did not say a damn word. When the Libyans started protesting, we \"warned\" that peaceful protest must be allowed. \n \n When Saudi Arabia rolled tanks into Bahrain, literally for the purpose of gunning down protesters because the military in Bahrain was unwilling to do it, we did not say a singe word. \n \n THAT is the hypocrisy of the president...or of the left if you prefer.
