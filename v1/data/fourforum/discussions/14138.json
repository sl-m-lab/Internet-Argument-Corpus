   "Tonight, on PBS, a Frontline special on the deals behind the health care legislation. See link for local showtimes. I'm guessing it will also be available afterwards for viewing on the internet. The link also includes a preview.\n \n \nBarack Obama promised change. Then he took on one of Washington's toughest issues: health care. During his first year in office, he found himself making one deal after another with Capitol Hill's powerful insiders--lobbyists and influential members of Congress. He angered his political base, watched his popularity sink, and nearly failed to pass the bill. In Obama's Deal, FRONTLINE follows the story of the president's historic victory and offers the first in-depth look at how the Obama administration operates. Veteran FRONTLINE producer Michael Kirk (Bush's War, Dreams of Obama, Inside the Meltdown) provides a sobering view inside Obama's deals and reveals the realities of American politics, the power of special interest groups, and the role of money in policy making.\n \n FRONTLINE: Coming Soon - Obama's Deal | PBS\n\n \n I am understanding the show will also cover how single payer advocates were not allowed a seat at the discussion table, and how, a year ago today, they were arrested at the Senate Finance Committee hearing for nevertheless speaking out in challenge to Max Baucus.\n \n This thread is for discussing the show, so if you don't plan on seeing it, don't bother saying something stupid, Archie. Steeve, you don't even exist. Go back to cooking your daily books, for the health insurance ghouls you work for.\n \n It's good that they're expanding the safety net, but ultimately, this bill bringing 30 million new customers to the health insurance industry is not what we need. What we need is simple single payer legislation opening up Medicare to all Americans.\n \n Health care is a human right.",

   "I'll look forward to any thoughts on the documentary. I saw it, but didn't like it, and found it was a real waste, even though it included some footage of single payer advocates getting arrested under the auspices of Max Baucus. It missed so much it was mind-boggling. \n \n Reading the comments at PBS' website where you can watch it online, it seems a lot of people didn't like it, however they fell down on the issues.\n \n Here's a response article by Dr. Margaret Flowers published today on the *documentary*. Dr. Flowers is a non-partisan advocate for opening up Medicare, and is seen in the brief footage of non-violent demonstrators at the Senate Finance Committee meeting who were arrested. The article can be found at truthout.org.\n \n \nFrontline Fronts For the Corporations\n \n It was with a sense of deja vu that I watched the latest Frontline documentary about health care. \"Obama's Deal\" endeavored to reveal the significant influence of health industry dollars on our political process. However, as in Frontline's \"Sick Around America,\" the producers did a disservice by their failure to educate the public about the bigger picture of the health care situation in this nation and the range of possible solutions.\n \n Curiously, just as it was in the health \"debate,\" single-payer, improved Medicare for all was also excluded from the film. The major point of the influence of health industry dollars on the reform process that should have been mentioned is that these dollars were spent in order to restrict the debate and protect industry profits. The lucrative status quo would have been threatened if single payer had been openly discussed because a publicly financed national health program can provide high quality universal health care and control health care costs, something a private-insurance-based system cannot accomplish.\n \n After watching this film, viewers would have no idea that single payer exists or know that there is a strong movement for it. Considering that there have been attempts to push for a national health program for more than 100 years in this nation and that, because of a strong grass-roots movement, single-payer legislation was nearly introduced on the floor of the House in November and was actually introduced on the floor of the Senate for the first time in this nation last December, the omission appears to be intentional.\n \n Those of us in the single-payer movement are accustomed to being censored by the corporate media. The reason for our exclusion is known: Health insurance and pharmaceutical corporations advertise heavily on these airwaves and wield considerable power over the programming. This was described clearly by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting's August 2009 piece titled \"Single-Payer & Interlocking Directorates: The corporate ties between insurers and media companies,\" by Kate Murphy.\n \n The producers at Frontline carefully cut single payer out of the film. When the host, Mr. Kirk, interviewed me for \"Obama's Deal,\" we spoke extensively of the single-payer movement and my arrest with other single-payer advocates in the Senate Finance Committee last May.\n \n However, our action in Senate Finance was then misidentified as \"those on the left\" who led a \"counterattack\" because of \"liberal outrage\" at being excluded. This occurred despite an email exchange following the release of the preview in which I specifically requested that the producers identify that we are a nonpartisan group fighting for single payer: a health reform model based on evidence of what is effective here and abroad and on health policy principles. This mischaracterization unfortunately mirrors the way in which the health industry has portrayed the single-payer movement (verified by Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive).\n \n \"Obama's Deal\" contained a segment on those who oppose health reform, but nowhere were single-payer advocates given a chance to explain their proposal or motivations. Neither was it noted that the hatred and fear seen at the summer town halls and that factored into the election of Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown were assisted by the stealth organizing efforts of ultra-conservative Dick Armey of FreedomWorks and others.\n \n We have the resources in this nation to achieve the same high quality health outcomes and health security that exist in other advanced nations. One reason for our failure is the intentional misinformation and omission of information in corporate media. Our public media does a disservice by leaving out the full picture of our broken political process, its effect on the health and economic well-being of our people and the truth of what we can achieve.\n",
