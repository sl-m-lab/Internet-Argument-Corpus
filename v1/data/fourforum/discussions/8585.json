   "\"Under this standard, DOMA is constitutional because the legislature was entitled to believe that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples furthers procreation, essential to survival of the human race, and furthers the well-being of children by encouraging families where children are reared in homes headed by the children's biological parents. \"\n \n \"the legislature was entitled to believe\"\n \n So here's my question for the legal scholars out there. If the legislature wrote a law that said all dog are the spawn of satan and must be shot on sight, would the courts be forced to say that the legislature is \"entitled to believe\" that dogs are satan spawn? Is the legislature entitled to believe anything they like, even if it's completely divorced from fact? If the legislature writes laws based on erroneous assumptions, are the courts unable to do anything about it unless it violates their Constitution?",

The courts see if you 1) violated a current law or 2) if a new law violates a higher law\n \n Their job is not to determine the sanity of a law (unless of course their constitution says they must do so). And yes, this does cause some rather crappy outcomes but the alternative is having the courts be the supreme rulers.",
