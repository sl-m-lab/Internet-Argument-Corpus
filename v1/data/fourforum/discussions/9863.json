   "Is banning same sex marriage sex discrimination? If I as a man am prohibited from marrying a man because of my sex then how is this not sex discrimination. I am being denied something based upon my sex. \n \n \n \n The reason I bring this up is that those pushing for radification of the ERA seem to believe that this statement \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.\" does not apply marriage. http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm \nHow does the ERA relate to the issue of homosexual rights?\n ERA opponents&#8217; claim that the amendment would require states to allow same-sex marriage is false. The state of Washington rejected such a claim under its state ERA in the 1970s. The state of Hawaii, which considered such a claim under its state ERA, recently amended its constitution to declare marriage a contract between a man and a woman. The legislative history of the ERA shows that its intent is to equalize rights between women and men, not to address issues of discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\n \n The second thing is with Alito, and Roberson on the bench, they being literallists, then would they not rule for same sex marriage if the ERA is ratified and a case comes before them?",

It violated the Hawai'ian Constitution's equal protection guarantees (Article I, Section 5) against gender discrimination. The court remanded the case to the Circuit Court, stating that licenses should be issued to same-sex couples, unless the state can show a compelling interest in banning such marriages. \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_mar5a.htm\n \n \n\n \n My point is that at least one court has agreed with Matthew's assertion here.",

I think that the laws that prohibit same-sex couples from marrying do so precisely because of, on account of, their sex. The laws require a person of one sex to marry someone of the other sex, and thus they discriminate on account of the sex of two people of the same sex. The ONLY difference between a heterosexual marriage and a gay marriage is the sex of the parties marrying. That's all. And the current marriage laws in most states, as a result of the DOMA laws, discriminate against people on account of their sex, by prohibiting a man from marrying a man purely because he is a man and by prohibiting a woman from marrying a woman purely because she is a woman. The marriage laws do not reflect animus against individuals because of their sex, but they do discriminate against people because of, or on account of, their sex.
