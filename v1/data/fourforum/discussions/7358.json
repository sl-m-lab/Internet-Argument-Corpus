   "Got involved in another series of letters to the editor about religion.\n \n \nFriday, November 11, 2005\n \n A free country\n \n In light of the recent letters concerning Intelligent Design versus evolution, I would like to mention one fundamental point. This is a free country. You are free to believe what you wish, as am I. You are free to live your life according to your beliefs, as am I.\n \n Indeed, it is where our joint interest is concerned that the problem arises.\n \n It was the hope of the founding fathers that the United States not become embroiled and divided by religious conflicts that had caused so much bloodshed in Europe, yet here we are, divided anyway.\n \n The founders were trying to establish a secular state. There are a huge number of religions in the world, 22 claiming 500,000 believers or more. People from all of those religions are welcome here. Our country and its schools need to be secular enough to treat people from all religions equally.\n \n That is why Christianity cannot be promoted in our public schools.\n \n Dana Howell\n Midland City\n \n\n \n What she said about the Founding Fathers is correct. But some ignorant Christian has to \"set the record straight\" (!?!?!?!)\n \n \nFriday, December 2, 2005\n \n Christian origins\n \n Each day I read the letters that are sent in to the editor by my fellow citizens. Some are enlightening, some are amusing and then there are the few that are absolutely outrageous.\n \n On Nov. 11, I once again was faced with the outrageous and knew I must respond. I am not quite sure where letter writer Dana Howell found her information on our founding fathers and their intentions concerning religion, but I feel it my duty as an American to set the record straight.\n \n The Mayflower Compact of 1620 stated \"Having undertaken, for the glory of God, and advancement of the Christian faith ...\"\n \n Our founding fathers separated themselves from England because of religious persecution to begin a nation where there would be freedom to worship, not freedom from worship. Their actions show me our country was founded under the Christian faith.\n \n When James Madison, the father of our Constitution, proposed the division of our central government, he read from Isaiah 33:22: \"For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King; He will save us.\"\n \n Our first president, George Washington, said that it is impossible to rightly govern without God and Bible.\n \n These were our founding fathers and how anyone can look at history and dispute a Christian-based nation is beyond all reason. I know that the people of our great nation are free to believe anything they choose; however, we are not free to rewrite history. \n \n I can't help but wonder why our children can't pray in a classroom yet a prayer opens each and every session of Congress, or why another's religion takes precedent over Christianity in this country.\n \n Americans are free to believe in anything they choose, but one must realize everything in this country today is in place because of men who expected Christianity to be our religion.\n \n We are members of a free country, free to believe what we want, free to live the way we want and free to say anything we want.\n \n Donna Windham\n Ashford\n \n\n \n What a load of :xcensored \n \n There's an interesting personal part to this too. At my university I am a member of an honors/service organization called Gamma Beta Phi. And guess who the President of our chapter is ... yep, Donna Windham! I wasn't going to let that stop me from setting her straight on a few things.\n \n \nTuesday, December 20, 2005\n \n A look at history\n \n With regard to Donna Windham's Dec. 2 letter, I'd like to start by pointing out that this country was not founded in 1620 with the Mayflower Compact. The only true founding document of our nation is the Constitution, which wasn't written until 1789. And unlike the mere Mayflower Compact, the nation-founding Constitution is a secular document, not mentioning Jesus, God or Christianity, and with its only two references to religion being restrictions on the government.\n \n The first restriction is, \"... no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\" Soon after the U.S. Constitution's ratification, most states began to remove - voluntarily - their own \"religious tests\" from their state Constitutions.\n \n The second restrictions (the Establishment and Free Exercise clauses) are contained in the First Amendment. In 1802 Thomas Jefferson explained that their intent was to erect a \"wall of separation between church and state.\" Jefferson also authored Virginia's 1786 Act for Establishing Religious Freedom, which served as a basis for the Constitution's method of handling religion.\n \n Ms. Windham quotes James Madison, the \"father\" of our Constitution, to support her views. While it is true that Madison was a Christian, he was against legislating religion onto others; not even he would have founded this as a Christian nation.\n \n In 1785, while opposing a religious bill, Madison wrote, \"It degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority. Distant as it may be in its present form from the Inquisition, it differs from it only in degree.\"\n \n Finally, in 1797 the President of the United States, John Adams, signed the Treaty of Tripoli, which stated, \"... the government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion ...\".\n \n Rick Pierson\n Dothan\n \n\n \n A few days after I sent that off, I was skimming through my e-mails, came across it, and reread it. I then saw my typo: I said the Constitution was written in 1789 instead of 1787. Rats! Too late.\n \n \nSunday January 8, 2006\n \n A note on history\n \n In response to Rick Pierson's Dec. 20 letter to the editor, I wish to make some comments.\n \n The letter is well written and it sets forth with clarity the secularists' world view in part and in particular their view of the establishment of our form of government. However, it is fraught with historical inaccuracies.\n \n Our constitution was written in the hot summer of 1787, not in 1789 as Mr. Pierson writes. While it does not mention the word \"God\" or \"Jesus,\" as he rightly avers, it does conclude with the words, \"Done in Convention by the Unanimous Consent of the States present the Seventeenth Day of September in the year of our LORD (all caps mine) one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven....\"\n \n What Lord does Mr. Pierson think the founders meant? If he could ask all of them, they would give him a name he and other secularists try to blot out at Christmastime.\n \n Further, Mr. Pierson quotes a statement attributed to President John Adams in the Treaty of Tripoli. What he doesn't say is he is quoting from a transcript copy of the document, not the original document, since it is nowhere to be found.\n \n Historians are still discussing whether or not the words attributed to President Adams were in the original document since an earlier transcript copy than the one Mr. Pierson quotes does not include those words.\n \n It is thought by some historians - and not without good reason - that the words, \"...the government of the United States is not in any sense, founded on the Christian religion...\", were inserted by someone other than John Adams at a later date.\n \n But if the words were in the original document, they do not mean what secularists construe them to mean. John Adams simply meant the United States did not have an established Christian Church as Great Britain had at the time.\n \n One final fact that Mr. Pierson misses: Our Union dates back to Oct. 14, 1774, when the delegates to the First Continental Congress issued the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress.\n \n Mike Greer\n Midland City\n \n\n \n I've sent off the following reply: don't know if or when it will get printed.\n \n \nIn his Jan. 8 letter, Mike Greer's desperate attempts to prop up the \"Christian Nation\" fallacy fail.\n \n He tries to redirect our focus to a document from 1774. But we were still ruled by England at that time: has Mr. Greer forgotten about the Declaration of Independence (1776) and the Revolutionary War, which didn't end until 1783? \n \n The document that founded our nation is the US Constitution, and it is secular. What about, as Mr. Greer points out, its being dated \"in the year of our Lord\"?\n \n That phraseology was used out of tradition. That's how official documents were dated back then; in fact, it's still used more than 200 years later. My college diploma - granted by a secular, public university - also uses \"year of our Lord\" to date it. That phrase does not make my diploma a Christian document, nor my alma mater a Christian institution. \n \n Further, our Constitution specifies days of the week using pagan-based traditions. Sunday, for example, was named in honor of the pagan Sun god. Would Mr. Greer therefore argue that the Constitution's use of \"Sunday\" makes it a pagan document, that founds a pagan nation? \n \n Mr. Greer seems unaware of the wide ranging effects the Enlightenment had on the 1780s. Jefferson did not accept the divinity of Jesus; neither did Franklin, Ethan Allen, Thomas Paine, or many others. If we were to ask all of the great historical figures of that day about their beliefs in God we would not receive the unanimous Christian reply Mr. Greer presupposes.\n \n Finally, contra Mr. Greer, the version of the Treaty of Tripoli that President Adams and the Senate approved in 1797 was Joel Barlow's English translation, which did state, \"... the government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion ...\".\n \n Rick Pierson\n Dothan \n \n\n \n \n And then Donna - the President of the local chapter of Gamma Beta Phi - wrote a response, that got printed. It's not much better than her first!\n \n \nThursday January 12, 2006\n \n 'Clearing it up'\n \n In response to Rick Pierson's Dec. 20 letter, I would like to clear a few things up. In my Dec. 2 letter, I did not say this country was founded with the 1620 Mayflower Compact, I was merely pointing out its wording. My letter, which was edited because of its length, had contained many references.\n \n The United States of America was \"founded\" long before the documents were written. We may not have been called \"The United States,\" but this was America all the same. From the moment we stepped foot on this great land, this was to be America. The documents only served to make it \"legal.\"\n \n Those men who would later be known as our founding fathers sponsored the publication of the Bible, imposed Christian morality on the armed forces and granted public lands to promote Christianity among the Indians, which, to me, shows our country was founded under the Christian faith.\n \n Mr. Pierson quoted Virginia's 1786 Act for Established Religious Freedom, however he failed to quote the first passage in that document, \"Well aware that Almighty God hath created the mind free ...\"\n \n He also made a point to mention President John Adams and his signing the Treaty of Tripoli but failed to mention the feelings of our first president, George Washington, on Christianity: \"It is impossible to rightly govern without God and Bible.\"\n \n Everyone is free to believe in anything they choose, but must realize everything in this country today is in place because of men who expected Christianity to be our religion.\n Today's laws are directly derived from the Ten Commandments, our money says \"In God we trust\" and, like it or not, we are still referred to as \"One Nation Under God.\" We are members of a free country, free to believe what we want, free to live the way we want and free to say anything we want.\n \n Donna Windham\n Ashford\n \n\n \n I haven't finished my response yet, but this is the very very very rough draft (if it can even be called that).\n \n \nDonna's statement, \"From the moment we stepped foot on this land, this was to be America\" shows an utter disregard for the millions of people who were already inhabiting \"our\" America: the Native Americans. Perhaps those millions of \"Indians\" are inconsequential to Donna and her ilk because they weren't Christians.\n \n Donna apparently holds her Christian forefathers in very high regard. I wonder if she realizes that in the colonies in the early 1600s, Christian settlers in the south shipped in blacks from Africa for use as slaves; the Puritans persecuted the Anglicans, and vice versa, and they both persecuted Quakers, Catholics, and Jews; and in the late 1600s, Christians' superstitious beliefs underlay the Salem Witch Hunts. Are these Donna's Christian forefathers she wants us all to remember so fondly and proudly? The slayers of Native Americans, the enslavers of African Americans, the intolerant religious persecutors, and the overly superstitious fools?\n \n \n \n \n Interesting side note about the early Christian slaveholders. Their religion pushed them to convert their slaves to Christianity, but they didn't want to because it was okay to enslave only non-Christians (if they converted their slaves, they'd have to set them free). The Christians solved their dilemma by passing acts that allowed the Christian whites to both convert their black slaves to Christianity and to retain the black Christians as slaves thereafter: thus allowing the Christian whites to have their cake and it too, so to speak.\n \n \n She forgets to mention that Thomas Jefferson was not a Christian, but a deist. In fact, in a letter to John Adam, Jefferson said, \"One day the dawn of reason and freedom of thought in the United States will tear down the artificial scaffolding of Christianity. The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as His father, in the womb of a virgin will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.\" Jefferson's God was not Donna's Christian God. \n \n Donna also seems to be hung up on statements of personal belief. We could swap pro- and anti-Christian statements made by important historical figures of that day back and forth and wouldn't change a thing. Statements about one's personal beliefs made in letters or general addresses to the public do not found our nation: the Constitution does, and it is secular.\n \n",

You have to believe that there was no real art before federal funding\nWhat body part did you eject this idea from, EZ?\n \n5. You have to believe that global temperatures are less affected by cyclical documented changes in the earth's climate and more affected by soccer moms driving SUV's.\nGeesh! Another lie. Liberals are much more scientific than to pull \"scientific facts\" out of unmentionable body openings and realize that global warming is caused by a multitude of factors, including human activity.\n \n6. You have to believe that gender roles are artificial, but being homosexual is natural.\nAnother lie rooted in ignorance. Tell me why in some cultures women wear pants and men wear skirts while in other cultures women who wear pants are considered heretics and other rules of gender that are different in different cultures and ethnic groups.\n \n7. You have to believe that the AIDS virus is spread by a lack of federal funding instead of controlling one's sexual behavior.\nAnother lie. Federal funding would be used to educate the public about how AIDS is spread and how to be sexually responsible.\n \n8. You have to believe that the same teacher who can't teach 4th-graders how to read is somehow qualified to teach those same kids about sex.\nGad, where do all these lies come from? Some people must be very practiced liars.\n \n9. You have to believe that hunters don't care about nature, but loony activists, who have never been outside of San Francisco, do.\nAnother lie. Lots of conservatives live in San Francisco, um, a lot of these conservatives who live in San Francisco are gay, and a lot of liberals own guns and hunt and fish.\n \n10. You have to believe that self-esteem is more important than actually doing something to earn it.\nOh, another lie.\n \n11. You have to believe that Mel Gibson spent $25 million of his own money making, \"The Passion Of The Christ\" just for financial gain only.\nAnother lie. Gibson certainly was filled with religious fervor in his fever to make the passion--and he certainly had the $25 million to blow, and he certainly made a lot of money from the film.\n \n12. You have to believe the NRA is bad because it supports certain parts of the Constitution, while the ACLU is good because it supports certain parts of the Constitution.\nOh, a lie. I'm not going to say I know what the NRA stands for but I suspect it only stands for the 2nd Amendment and doesn't give a hoot about the rest of the Constitution. The ACLU supports ALL OF THE CONSTITUTION, as any idiot who knows anything about the ACLU would know.\n \n13. You have to believe that taxes are too low and that taxing people into bankruptcy actually creates jobs.\nAnother lie. Lower income who file for bankrupty do so because of medical emergencies which run up huge bills, loss of jobs, divorce, deaths, illness, not because of taxes. Um, interesting to note that when Clinton raised taxes, more and better jobs were available in the United States of America--as opposed to the pitiful employment situation we have right now--apart from the Bushies trumpeting great success with a bunch of jobs available at McDonald's.\n 14. You have to believe that Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore, and Gloria Steinem are more important to American history than Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and Thomas Edison.[/QUOTE]Tripping out on LSD again, EZ?\n \n15. You have to believe that standardized tests are racist, but racial quotas and set-asides are not.\nThis doesn't even make sense.\n \n16. You have to believe that Hillary Clinton and Ted Kennedy and Howard Dean are totally normal and very nice people.\nAnother lie. I've never seen any liberals going around saying that those folks are \"nice.\"\n \n17. You have to believe that the only reason socialism hasn't worked anywhere it's been tried is because the right people haven't been in charge. LOL!\nAnother lie. All of the liberals I know are happy capitalists.\n \n18. You have to believe that Al Gore and John Kerry, in all their folly, were going to be the Saviors of modern America.\nAnother lie. Not saviors, just folks who might have been smarter about how to govern the U.S. and keep it safe.\n \n19. You have to believe that homosexual parades displaying drag, transvestites, body-part grabbing, and bestiality should be constitutionally protected, while manger scenes at Christmas should be illegal.\n \nAnother lie. Lots of liberals happily celebrate Christmas and have Christmas trees and creches displayed in their homes and go to church and a number of them might even find a homosexual parade to be shocking. I've never really seen a gay parade but obviously you have. Did you take videos of the body-grabbing and bestiality so you have proof of these activities?\n \n 'Sides, didn't Reagan and a bunch of his cronies get off by dressing in drag and whooping it up in the trees in that there Bohemian club they belonged to? Speaking of drag and transvestites, giggle, what about J. Edgar Hoover? I understand he had a really cute tutu--alas, it wasn't cute when he wore it.",

You have to believe that gender roles are set by God, but whether teachers in public schools endorse religion is a matter of choice.
