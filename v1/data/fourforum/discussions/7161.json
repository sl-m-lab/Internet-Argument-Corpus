In fact, I ran into a few of them at a bowl game this year. As for governmental accounting...yeah, I deal mainly with governmental stuff..specifically tax, audit, and financial reporting with a few other things mixed in. \n \n Traditional southern values? I dunno about that one. Perhaps in some respects but its hard to label me as any one set of moral beliefs. I do like values such as respect, honesty, and putting others before yourself (thats badly worded) and those tend to be thought of as Southern values sometimes. \n \n So lets recap Steeeeve's profile for those that are so very interested in my life:\n \n -Younger than Jim (I think) but out of college\n -Male\n -No specified race\n -Accounting degree\n -Works in a place that deals mostly with government accounting and various other aspects\n -Has the ability to frequent conversations with professors\n -Is annoyed by CPEs\n -Used to be in Virginia\n -Doesn't work for the GAO or PCAOB\n \n There you have it :) Glad to know some are interested ha.",
