   "So admiring themselves USA are coming to look like totalitarian and even fascist power. They are so carried away by struggle for obtrusion of democratic principles and human rights in whole the world... NO, NO, I have nothing against democratic principles and human rights but even Americans notice that there is much less that precious democracy in USA themselves and that human rights of Americans are broken more often than not. Then American military men's behavior in Abu-Grabe and Guantanamo shouldn't be astonishing. It is only a reflection of the situation inside USA. The brutal treatment of the captured and local inhabitants in occupied countries became normal. Generally the cruelty in USA became normal. Americans even take for grunted the plan of the White House to apply nuclear weapons against Iran for \"victory of democracy\" in this country! Some time ago I got interested in history and found out that nuclear weapon was worked out in Nazi Germany too to never be used. How come that George Bush is crueler than Hitler?",

We do not F-test them, nor do we use Gosset's t distribution. the way we do things is a little different. We order the specialty screws 20% over specificaiton for shear, thermal stability, whatever, then we conduct our material testing, cluster the data, and generate a new spec (which is always over our needed spec). This allows us to use the same batch of screws on different projects as long as they fall within spec of that project.\n \n If you simply F-test them all you really find out is that the lots are close (or in some cases way off). The results of our end data are generally lower than the initial specs.
