Here we have a prototypical slight of hand technigue. Watch how it works. \n \n First distract your opponent with a slashing personal attack. Call your opponent a gun nut. While he is sputtering, change the argument. \"Only 200 deaths a year from knife-like weapons.\"\n \n See? Now you think that knives were only used 200 times last year in all the Realm. But now... The rest of the story. \n \n On first glance it may make you feel better to know that knives were used only in only 7% of the 2.4 million violent crimes committed in 2004-2005 in the UK. So if you were one of those 168,000 victims of knife crime, consider yourself unfortunate, but alive.\n \n AHA!!! The Gun nut admits defeat!!! Oh Rapture!!!\n \n Not quite. Bear with me. As Columbo would say \"Just one more thing\".\n \n \n \nIn 2005/06, knives were used in six per cent of woundings - 32,820 knife-use incidents in 547,000 woundings.\n\n \n What are you talking about??? You're a gun nut!!! You're just showing that knives are not the problem!!!\n \n Indeed. That has been my point all along. You do not blame the tool you blame the hand that wields it. The larger question here is what the hell are you guys wounding each other with? Not knives or guns! You are going to have to ban a whole some more stuff to ensure your safety. Apparently folks are going at it with candlesticks and lead pipes and all other non-banned Clue pieces. \n \n Which prompted me to investigate violent crime rates per capita. Guess what I found:\n \n http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs06/hosb1206chap78.pdf\n \n Pg 119. Violent crime rates 2,300 per 100,000.\n \n Now compare that to the FBI data for the US. Note: 2005 is the last year for which data is available. http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_01.html\n \n Violent crime rate, US = 469.2 per 100,000.\n \n Wow.\n \n A nation of Gun nuts has 469.2 violent crimes per 100,000 while our gentle gun-banning erstwhile countrymen have 2300.\n \n Wow.\n \n It would appear that it is the Brits, rather than \"the Gun Nuts\" who \"claim that when guns are banned people will just use knives instead\".

The BCS is a criminal victimization survey (people are randomly selected and interviewed about their experiences with crime) while the FBI data is based on crime reported to law enforcement. Not all crime is reported to the police so it's not surprising that the BCS numbers are higher. \n \n As for the knife culture of the UK, people are less likely to die from knife wounds than gun wounds. Guns make it easier to kill at a distance which makes it harder for a victim to run away. You might be able to outrun a person with a knife, but it's harder to outrun a bullet. \n \n \"An attack committed with bare hands or a blunt instrument requires sustained effort against a victim who is actively trying to fight back or flee. These attacks often result in hospitalization followed by recovery. Using a knife decreases the victim's chances of survival, but still he/she may be able to fight or flee. A gun, however, allows the assailant to kill or wound in an instant, and to attack from a distance. Gunshot wounds are much more likely to be lethal - the reason that armies are equipped with firearms (For an overview of the lethality of firearms see Cukier and Sidel (3)). Several studies have highlighted this lethality (4, 5). A comparison of hospital admissions of wound victims in South Africa found that 6% of knife wounds were fatal, while 28% of those with firearm wounds died. In Zambia, patients with firearm wounds required longer stays in hospital, and were admitted more frequently into intensive care units (ICU), and required more X-rays than contusions (6). When firearms have replaced traditional weapons in societies with pre-existing patterns of violence, observers found a marked increase in the lethality and destructiveness of conflict.\" \n http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jphp/journal/v28/n4/full/3200153a.html",

   "As for the knife culture of the UK, people are less likely to die from knife wounds than gun wounds. Guns make it easier to kill at a distance which makes it harder for a victim to run away. You might be able to outrun a person with a knife, but it's harder to outrun a bullet.\n\n \n This whole statement is nothing more than a complete fallacy, brought on by the supporters of gun control to try and scare people. Watch as I destroy it with my real world knowledge.\n \n The first statement \"As for the knife culture of the UK, people are less likely to die from knife wounds than gun wounds\" this is just completely false. A knife wound can just as easily lead to your death as a gun wound, and the lethality of each relies on a little something us in the game of target shooting refer to as \"placement\". Whether you're shot or simply stabbed, you're highly unlikely to die or bleed to death if you're hit in a nonvital area like the shoulder or the hand or the thigh, because there just plain isn't that much in the way that qualifies as a vital sector.\n \n The way people die when shot or stabbed is when a major blood vessle is damaged, resorting in heavy blood loss in a very short amount of time, or a vital organ or the nervous system is dealt a critical blow. And this can be acheived easily with either a knife, gun or any other type of impliment. Some might argue a knife is even MORE deadly than a gun because once the blade enters your body it keeps following a single course and won't fragment like a bullet, allowing it to penetrate deeper.\n \n The second statement \"Guns make it easier to kill at a distance which makes it harder for a victim to run away\" is completely illogical. While it's true guns are better for use as a distance tool than a knife, that doesn't necessarily make it any easier to kill someone. If you can't aim properly and you can't hit what you're trying to aim at then you're not doing much as all except wasting money, and ammo is getting to be very expensive these days. And anybody who hasn't practiced heavily with their guns will tell you, hitting a moving target is very, if not extremely, difficult. If somebody is jumping around and not allowing you to do a target acquisition then by the time you fire they're likely going to be somewhere else when the bullet leaves your gun.\n \n The third statement \"You might be able to outrun a person with a knife, but it's harder to outrun a bullet\" is just plain crazy. This assumes that you're actually trying to avoid being shot by running faster than the bullet will travel. As with the second statement, guns are only dangerous if they can actually hit something, otherwise they're nothing more than an expensive noisemaker. It's not a matter of having to outrun a bullet, it's a matter of not being in the direct path of a bullet, and this is actually easier than it sounds. \n \n And if you run away from an attacker, you're actually gonna be more likely to be murdered if you force them to give chase to you when they have a knife. They don't want a hassle, and if you give it to them they might murder you out of anger when they had no plans to. Take if from somebody's that's been known to throw an appliance when it refuses to work properly, or snap a pencil in half when the lead breaks.",

While I don't doubt that anyone sufficiently determined to get a gun can do so, I do doubt that all gun crimes are meticulously planned out beforehand - the criminal simply had a gun to hand and saw the opportunity arise.\n\n \n What I wanted answered, was how the hell would you make it hard to obtain guns? Would you wave a magic wand or something?\n \n \nSource?

Yes, they changed on carrying.\n \n \nHere Ethmi accidentally makes a point for the wrong side. The argument earlier was that guns were less 'lethal' than knives, and that running in a zig-zag patter was a valid way of dodging a bullet.

   "\n Until it can be shown that more people protect themselves by use of firearm than are injured/killed by legally obtained firearms (which, incidentally, looks like being not the case), I hold that gun control is the best way to reduce violence and fatalities. \n \n To grant everyone access to a most lethal weapon such as a gun borders on sheer stupidity.\n\n \n You don't always have to discharge a firearm to protect yourself. There are many cases where a criminal is deterred simply because he sees a gun or is warned of a gun's presence.\n \n Also, what is your definition of \"legally obtained?\" If a criminal steals a gun legally purchased by a law abiding citizen and uses it to commit a crime, that is not a \"legally obtained\" gun as the criminal broke the law to obtain the weapon.\n \n This is the core of the issue. Criminals disobey the law by nature; it's what makes them criminals. If a criminal intends to break a law that restricts them from committing a violent crime, why on earth do you think they are going to respect the much lesser infraction of owning an illegal weapon? The answer is - they aren't. Gun control laws won't stop criminals; in reality, it will make more criminals because there are many normal, law-abiding citizens who are not going to willingly give up their natural born right (according to the Supreme Court) to bear arms.",

So I ask you - in a district with a complete ban on handguns (as handguns are 99.99% of the time used in gun crimes), why is the death by gun rate higher per capita by almost double anywhere else in the US?\n \n\n \nIllegal arms: Machine gun, sawed-off shotgun, or weapon/instrument of kind commonly known as a blackjack, slingshot, sand club; silencers; imitation pistol with unlawful intent; unlicensed pistol concealed\n ...\n [who may not own] Pistols: 1. Drug addict; 2. Convicted felon; 3. Convicted of soliciting prostitution, keeping bawdy or disorderly house; 4. Vagrants, 5. Not of sound mind\n\n Well, I suppose that serves me right for taking Ethmi's source seriously. I was just going on what I was given - blame Ethmi.\n \n To take a serious look at the issue: DC is a city, with population of ~500,000 people - population density ~9000 per square mile. It's hardly surprising that it's crime rates are higher than anywhere else, because populations centres are breeding grounds for crime - high pop. density results in a massive difficulty in controlling and/or enforcing the law.\n In places like London, where the pop. dens. is similarly high, tackling gun crime has had a good effect, but only if massive campaigns are launched. As I showed with my link earlier, actively removing guns does genuinely cut down on crime - but you have to make that effort.\n \n \nIt's truly sad you believe people don't have the right to defend themselves.\nI would say that it is sadder if you believe that everyone arming themselves will result in a reduced loss of life.",

Should this be a pro-gun state they may fear that you are armed (but stay regardless, see the above sentence) and decide to try and get rid of you before you can get to them - you would then be in trouble, regardless of whether you actually have a gun or not, or if you realised that you weren't in a safe position or not.\n\n \n Which is why you shoot them first!\n \n \nIf this isn't a pro-gun state and they have decided to stay regardless of the risk of being caught, they can more or less ignore you. They take what they can grab and leave. You lose property, claim it on insurance, nothing has changed.\n\n \n What if you don't have insurance? And they'll still be roaming the streets, burglarizing other homes. Wow. They sure learned their lesson.\n \n \nNo, they are packing guns because the state has lax gun laws and because they fear that you might also have a gun (again, because of lax laws).\n\n \n How would they get a CCW permit? No state has gun laws so loose as to let felons get CCW permits, so they would have to carry illegally.",

   "Obviously not lax enough for a criminal to get one, but lax enough for normal people to get one. Now stop dodging my question and please answer.\n\n I'm sorry, I must have a different definition of 'answering the question' to you. As far as I am aware, the format goes Question? Answer + Rationale. Like this.\n \nIf someone had a gun cocealed and on them, do you think they are more or less likely to die in a violent attack? \n\n More likely. If they are carrying a concealed gun, then the state they are in has lax carrying laws. So, everyone with criminal intent will also be carrying. Violent attacks then become instantly more deadly.\n\n \n \nLax gun laws will prevent even small criminals from getting their hands on them. No state has so lax of gun laws that criminals can get their hands on a carry licence. And even if they did, what kind of criminal would go through all that trouble when they can just conceal it illegally, which is what nearly all criminals do. Surprisingly, CCW holders account for nearly zero percent of gun crime. Most gun crime is committed with illegal guns anyway.\n \n That said, lets stop using the \"lax law\" argument.\n\n Source on the bold? Besides, you miss my point. 'Lax laws' means that it is possible to carry a concealed weapon legally. This means that there is less likely to be enforcement against illegal weapons being carried in this manner.\n I'm in full agreement that adding laws on their own will not change anything. But enforcing those laws will have an effect. You're focusing on the 'law', and ignoring the 'enforcement', which is ignoring the larger half of my argument.\n \n \nHow many people do you think can really afford a safe room?\n \nI point you towards the recent trends in 'safe rooms'. Better yet, however, is to get out of the house. \n\n \n \nCriminals aren't stupid. They will not enter a house if they suspect someone inside has a gun unless they're trying to commit suicide.\n ...\n I gaurantee you, if a criminal suspects you have a gun, he will be out in a heartbeat. No question about that. Unless he is mentally disabled, he will not risk himself being killed for some stuff.\n\n This is provably false - the are burglaries and home invasions carried out in states where gun control is minimal. The threat of gun ownership is not sucessfull in these cases.\n \n \nEven so, people have a right to defend themselves, not matter how small the chance of attack is. Would you tell this to the victims of a violent home invasion?\n\n Then why are all weapons not legal? After all, all of them can be used for 'defence'.\n Mace, tazers, stun guns... I have nothing against defencive weaponry such as these, which are hard to use in an offensive manner.\n \n \nThen why were you suggesting above that they do?\n\n You're confusing 'know' with 'suspect'. To clarify, criminals do not 'know' if the owner of a house has a gun. They may 'suspect', however, depending on the gun laws of the state.\n \n \nChances are, the burglar is coming after you. Solo room clearing is suicide, and chances are you are highly trained with your weapon, and he is not. If you do it right, the odds of you getting shot are slim.\nWhoever said 'solo'? The only one you know to be alone in these situations is you, unless you happen to be having an NRA meeting at the time.\n \n \nAgain, criminals would usually not go through the trouble of aquiring legal firearms. And, if they are armed, chances are they are not going to be just \"stealing some stuff\".\n\n Why not? If you were to go into a house where there was a risk of being caught, you would want some manner of protection/intimidation against potential homeowners/dogs, regardless of whether the homeowner may be armed or not.\n I deny that most burglars enter a house with the intent of harming the homeowner.\n \n \nEthmi's stuff\n\n I think I covered all of this in reply to SnP",

Your question was the following: \"If someone had a gun concealed and on them, do you think they are more or less likely to die in a violent attack?\", not \"are you more or less likely to die if you defend yourself\".\n The rationale is, as I also stated, that a state which allows CCW will not spend as much time seeking out illegal CCW-ers. This means that if someone goes out with the intention of violently assaulting someone, they are more likely to carry a firearm as opposed to a slightly more excusable (in the eyes of the law) weapon such as a knife. The question then becomes: If you were attacked with a gun rather than a knife, are you more or less likely to survive? The answer should be obvious, regardless of whether you happened to be CCW or not.\n \n To repeat the question with a twist: would you rather be attacked by a gun when you also were carrying, or attacked with a knife when you were unarmed? Personally, I'd rather the knife - the alternative is to go through life with one hand constantly resting on your gun and the safety off.\n \n \nThis is just common sense. There could not be a source on this because this would require illegal gun owners to step forward and admit that they had committed a crime with their illegal gun. People who would commit crimes would not go through the trouble of buying an illegal gun.\nI deny this. If you can buy a gun legally and not have to worry about being arrested for unlawful possession, or (I would guess) pay quite so much, would you not take that option?

What you are proposing is anarchy. Lax laws means that criminals are not allowed to carry, however responsible citizens are. \nYou assume several things. Firstly, that criminals are born criminal - that it is impossible for a 'responsible citizen' to commit a crime. Secondly, you assume that there will be as much enforcement against criminal CCW in places where legal CCW is more widespread - that there is no correlation between legal and illegal CCW.\n To analogise this: in the UK it is illegal to drive your car without basic insurance. However, many people drive legally. As a result, there are very few checks by police to see if a specific driver on a specific day is legal - instead, you have to do something to catch the eye of the police beforehand.\n If less people drove legally, then there would be more checks for insurance and illegal driving would reduce equally.\n \n \nIf the Brady bunch had their way, over 1,199,287 more people would be dead by the beginning of this year.

Even if gun control will reduce the number of burglars carrying guns, they will carry a knife, a sword, a taser, a bat, something. And the victim will not be able to defend themselves, because all of these weapons require strength, which criminals usually have, while guns require skill, which criminals don't have.

The answer should be obvious, regardless of whether you happened to be CCW or not.\n\n \n I would say a gunshot wound or knife wound to the abdomen are equally deadly... your point about violent attacks is moot. If an attacker wants to kill you, they'll find a way. You're on the whim of the attacker... \n \n \nI deny this. If you can buy a gun legally and not have to worry about being arrested for unlawful possession, or (I would guess) pay quite so much, would you not take that option? I would say that common sense dictates that the only people with illegal guns are people who would not be allowed to buy legal ones.\n \n You assume several things. Firstly, that criminals are born criminal - that it is impossible for a 'responsible citizen' to commit a crime. Secondly, you assume that there will be as much enforcement against criminal CCW in places where legal CCW is more widespread - that there is no correlation between legal and illegal CCW.\n To analogise this: in the UK it is illegal to drive your car without basic insurance. However, many people drive legally. As a result, there are very few checks by police to see if a specific driver on a specific day is legal - instead, you have to do something to catch the eye of the police beforehand.\n If less people drove legally, then there would be more checks for insurance and illegal driving would reduce equally.\n\n \n So... you do believe a person is innocent until proven guilty. So why can't I INNOCENTLY carry a weapon and proven guilty if I commit a crime?\n \n \nHmm... I doubt this very much. Sources are here, here, here and here.\n \n \n Really not the case. See above.\n\n \n 3 out of your 4 sources you quoted are SURVEYS. Very subjective. I care about what is proven. And \"shooter\" pointed out that any self-defense with a firearm resulted in victims UNHARMED.\n \n \nAnyway, that is not what I claimed. I claimed that gun control will reduce the number of burglars who are carrying guns - which will reduce fatalities and/or injuries in a burglary.\n\n \n 32 years of gun control in Washington DC, crime has not been reduced. Go figure.\n \n \nNot so with a tazer... 15 feet of protection for $300, which is more than you need in most houses, especially if you are defending yourself rather than seeking out an invader.\n\n \n Again.. \"shooter\" puts a good point.. what if you miss? I can also get a shotgun, load it with rubber pellets and not kill a person. Would that satify your \"non-violent\" stop-the-killing feeling? I actually have a 12-gauge with rubber bullets.. ready to go. emoticon_emb \n \n \nLike I said in my last post, provably false. (Potential) criminals don't put round questionnaires to see if a house is armed or not, so the only clue they will have is the laws of the state they are in. Those clearly don't stop home invasions.\n \n 'Highly trained'? As far as I can tell, in the US only 6 states require training for gun licence. They are:\n 8 hour training class in Arizona (for CCW only)\n 'Training course' in Arkansas (for CCW only)\n 'State Approved Firearms Training' in Michigan (for CCW only)\n 15 hours & proficiency test in New Mexico (again, for CCW only)\n State approved training course in North Carolina (CCW only again)\n 12 hours of handgun training plus tests in Ohio (CCW, the wiki was unexplicit about other licences)\n \n Somehow, I don't think that this counts as 'highly trained'. And on what basis do you state that criminals will be incompetent gun users?\n\n \n Gang members are MORE well-trained than the local police because they spend more time at the range. There's an FBI report on this.... look for it. If you want good gun control, allow an officer to follow a known gang member to the local firing range and arrest his/her XXX. \n \n And most gun owners I know of do not shelve their guns for a rainy day.\n \n A part of the CCW education tells you can you will be charged with a crime when you shoot a person... See below for the difference between self-defense and manslaughter or assault.\n \n \nPfft. I disagree with this massively - for example, of the 32 cases where a gun was used in a home invasion (study is here), only 6 people were shot and no-one died.\n \n So you've changed from \"if they are armed, chances are they are not going to be just \"stealing some stuff\".\" to \"if there's someone in your house, shoot them!\".\n Doesn't this strike you as a little paranoid?\n\n \n Don't mistaken paranoia as a proactive approach to controlling one's destiny. Do you really believe all gun-owners have a gun within arms reach from anywhere in the house? Then you are being very stereotypical. You watch too many violent movies to get that type of impression.\n \n There is very fine line between SELF-DEFENSE and MANSLAUGHTER/ASSAULT. Self-defense is the use of deadly force to prevent imminent personal injury or death (NOT protection of property). Legally, you CANNOT shoot a person just for stealing stuff from your house; it's considered manslaughter or assault and you would be charged with it. Its up to you to prove that you shot for self-defense and prove imminent danger. If I was a statistician who wanted more gun control, I would put manslaughter cases as a violent gun crime to exaggerate the numbers. Numbers are amazing things.... :)",
