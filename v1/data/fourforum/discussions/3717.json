But their truth's disagree........ who is \"right\" who has the real \"truth\"?\n\n \n Why even set this in sci-fi? We've got heaps of religions on the known world.\n \n Here's one for you... say a number of people entered a debate forum with the purpose of defending 'evolution' which follows 'scientific method'. They dispute religion because they say, 'if religion is true,....which one?'.\n \n Then someone shows them that evolution is not an homogenous theory; not only are there different modes of theories of evolution; materialism, ID-theory, etc, but even within their version (materialism) there's different conflicting theories, some of which are mutually exclusive. Further to that, many of their notions about science aren't scientific, but based on philosophies of science; such as their false belief that there's only one 'scientific method', or that materialism, itself, is the only method of evolutionary theory. And to top it all off, science can't actually determine what is true, anyway.\n \n So they're arguing against a belief in certainty from a belief in uncertainty. They deride people's beliefs in God, etc, as being irrational, or illogical, but don't even realise the faulty basis of their own assumptions about evolutionary science.\n \n How do they react to this revelation? I would guess that there would be howls of protests, lots of ad hominems etc. This of course doesn't disprove 'evolution', but they don't even look to that, they're too busy attacking someone who'd dare question their a priori notions about science. That is, in this 'hypothetic forum' I'm talking about :)",

Although He does not neccessarly state that aliens do not exist, we are told that the universe is running down (the second law of thermodynamics) as a result of Adam's Fall.

   "The \"sci-fi\" setting for this musing is deliberate as I wished to delineate some important concepts through it.\n \n Why another planet? then there has been zero interaction between the two belief systems until they first meet when one race discovers the other. There is too much interrelated history between different belief systems humans have, things that could cloud the debate if I used an actual religion to make the comparison with Christianity.\n \n So we have two truths about the character of history taken from holy texts, both which are believed to be the infallable word of God. Because of an insistence on absolute truth, each view has built themselves into a position where they have no way of reconciling a different yet like view because of the difference in details...... sadly as Mach suggested it is difficult to see that leading to anything other than a \"we are right, we have the only truth\" mentality from each group of literal believers.\n \n Who is true though? both groups claim to have the truth, yet neither can agree that the others truth is, well true.\n \n Each side has claimed the absolute but is confronted by another, different absolute. As an observer of such a debate, how could one possibly make a call on who was the more right?\n \n \nIf aliens were found, I would seriously question my belief.

Thus far, no life has been discovered and I suspect very much that it never will be. I honestly don't know what I'ld do, but I most likely won't have to think about it. In such a circumstance, I would still believe the Bible and in the Christian God, partially because there is no better alternative, I know for sure that evolution cannot account for what we observe today and that many other religions do not fit in to well with the agriculture, astronomy, biology and geology that we observe.\n \n \nA couple of technical points: there are no rocks that contain organic matter and are 4500 years old.

Thus far, no life has been discovered and I suspect very much that it never will be.\n\n \n Off course this is hypothetical, but saying something has not happened or been seen yet doesn't mean we can ignore the possibility if it is reasonable.\n \n Look at Nasa's Near Earth Object Program to see why ignoring that which has not happened to us (in historical memory) is not a satisfactory response.\n \n \nI never said that there was rocks that contain organic matter and are 4,500 years old.

   "Your argument is most interesting. Especially fascinating in that it appears to be a deductive argument. As I recast it in informal-logic terms, you've argued thus (as one of several ways of stating your argument)...\n \n Premise #1...God is a God of love and justice, and thus does not make one group of persons suffer for another group's deeds.\n \n Premise #2...The 2nd law of thermodynamics (including its results of death, sickness, etc.), which applies throughout the universe, is the consequence of Adam's Fall.\n \n Premise #3 (for the reductio)...A group of aliens exists off the earth.\n \n Intermediate Conclusion #4...Being in the universe and subject to the 2nd Law, that group of aliens suffers as the result of another group's deeds.\n \n Contradictory Conclusion #5...A group of persons suffers for another's deeds BUT no group of persons suffers for another's deeds--CONTRADICTION.\n \n Therefore #6...No such aliens exist.\n \n * * * \n \n What an interesting argument! Whether or not SOUND, it's certainly VALID, deductively.\n \n No less interesting is your statement that, were aliens discovered, you'd have to \"seriously question your belief.\" More particularly, what you'd have to do is falsify at least one of Premise #1 or Premise #2.\n \n Fortunately, the hypothesis that aliens exist is partially testable. All you have to do is wait. If we never, ever find any, then perhaps you're right.

By invoking it as supporting evidence it can be seen to justify the belief on one hand, but also work against it on the other.
