   "It looks like the science based people here need some help. So I'm going to hit back. \n \n 1) A global flood, if it did occur, would have left fossils of every species in every strata as it laid down sediment. We should find all over the world, the same species in the same strata. No where on Earth do you find fossils of dinosaurs, mastodons, Precambrian shellfish and primates in the same strata. The flood was thought to have been extremely violent; churning up huge volumes of water this would have mixed the carcasses of species into one homogenous layer, advanced creatures with less advanced all whirling around in the cacophony of death together. While heavier species would have sunk faster, we should see more or less homogenous strata all over the Earth. This occurs nowhere on the planet. \n \n 2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth. No such layer of sediment exists for that time period. \n \n 3) The necessary water to cover the Earth would have been astronomical. The oceans cover roughly 2/3rds of the Earth. That is sea level, to cover the highest point, Everest (29,028 feet feet above sea level), would require JUST to raise sea level, 756,821,205 Cubic miles of water. \n \n The fundemental problem is that the Oceans, seas and bays make up 96.5% of total water on the Earth and they only have 321,000,000 cubic miles. That leaves a huge amount of water that would need to come from somewhere. \n \n http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/DanielChen.shtml \n \n There's simply isn't that much water on Earth to allow such a flood. \n Some argue that the mountains weren't that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. That's 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earth's core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earth's core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. That's way more then the surface of the Sun. \n \n 4) The global flood says that the world was covered by water. The problem with that is such an infusion of water would have created brine. As the water receded and evaporated, huge amounts of salt would have remained on the land. Very few plants can grow on salted Earth, and those who can are not agricultural crops. Virtually every creature in the oceans has a low tolerance for salinity change. A slight change can result in massive dieoffs. That would mean, as the salinity rapidly changed, that many creatures, if not virtually all would have died from osmosis. That means Noah would have had to keep two of every species of oceanic creatures onboard the ship. Given the measurements, the boat cannot hold two of every whale and shark. Even worse, as most of the oxygen comes from algea and seaweed, the change in salinity and pressure would have killed off the producers of oxygen. Life simply couldn't exist after a flood of such proportions. While some modern species can survive in salinity conditions very different then their norm, most cannot survive for extended periods of time, such as 40 days. Furthermore, their prey sources often cannot survive that long as well. Even more alarming is that if the alga managed to survive, the death of billions of life on Earth would have resulted in decay which results in nutrients which would have resulted in alga explosions like no other, removing oxygen from the oceans, suffocating every living thing left. \n \n 5) Some say that the water came from underground, a mile to be percise. The problem with that is the water would be superheated. Releasing 756,821,205 cubic miles of superheated water would have boiled everything to death almost instantly. The oceans would have also boiled away, killing all marine life, fresh water lakes would have done the same. The mantle of the Earth is 100 Celsius. Therefore the steam would be roughly that hot. That's 212 degrees Fahrenheit. 756,821,205 cubic miles of 212 degree Fahrenheit water in a world that is typically no hotter then 80 degrees average would be instant death to everything. \n \n 6) Finally, flood geology requires the compaction of 4.5 billion years of comet, asteroid and meteor strikes into a single year. The problem with that is the energy from such impacts would have to be compacted as well, and we all know that the energy is converted into heat. \n \n 3 x 107 kg x 4.5 x 109 years worth of meteorite flux \n =1.35 x 1017 kg of meteoritic material fell during the flood year. \n \n The energy imparted by this amount of material is equal to: \n 1/2 M V2, where M is the mass of the extraterrestrial material, and V is the velocity at which it falls to the Earth (equal to the escape velocity, or 11200 m/s). This gives: \n 1/2 (1.35 x 1017 kg) * (11200 m/s)2 \n = 8.5 x 1024 Joules. \n \n So the Earth's atmosphere would have had to accomodate 8 x 1024 J of energy from this falling meteorite matter. We can do a quick calculation to determine the amount of heating this would cause: \n \n Energy = Matmo * Cp *(T), where Matmo is the mass of the atmosphere (5 x 1018 kg), Cp is the pressure constant for air (about 716 J/kg * K for N2), and T is the temperature change of the atmosphere. Solve for T: \n T = Energy/ (Matmo * Cp) \n = 8 x 1024 J / ((5 x 1018 kg) *716 J /kg * K) \n = 2,400 K. \n \n So the temperature change of the Earth's atmosphere would be about a 2,40 K increase in a single year. That's over 3860 Fahrenheit. \n \n The flood never happened and by proxy creation as well. That however, does not invalidate Christanity as many Christians view the bible as a moral and value oriented book, not a accurate history book.",

Some places are extremely high, some lower then sea level. There's no way I could figure it out correctly. However, sealevel is uniform and it makes up 70% of the surface area anyways. Simply proving that if if the oceans necessary requirements are ridiculous is enough. The extra 30% is just a extra kick in the ribs, unnecessary. It was magic water! not the alchohol kind and God snapped his fingers and it all happened!, pardon me while I laugh so loudly the creationists in the 1400s can hear me\n \n \nOK. That's probably correct. I did the calculations in cubic kilometers.\n \n\n \n Well, then I'd have to convert everest to kilometers. I live in the US. Metric is alien. haahh.\n \n \nBut even worse, even if there were some unknown mechanism to cause such movement, it would generate heat.

The flood lasted for a bit over a year.\n \n \nHowever, I think that you need to rethink your algae bloom scenario. Above you state that algae are the oxygen producers, and now you state that they remove the oxygen.\n\n \n Gotcha. Well, they actually do both. Remember algae produces energy through photosynthesis but like all other plants, consumes oxygen as well. My point is such a massive growth would remove huge amounts of oxygen initially killing everything. Sure they would eventually replace it as algae died off, but it wouldn't matter then. \n \n \n\n Yet more heat. However, creationists deny that there are any sign of meteor or comet impact. That is one of the Hovendites favorite arguments. If the earth is old, then why aren't there craters like on the moon? The craters on the moon were caused, of course, by the battle between Satan and St. Michael (really! so said John Morris of the ICR).\n\n \n Are you serious? How do they explain away the iridium layers in addition to the fossils that no longer appear once such layers appear in the geological record? And aren't they forgetting that the moon has no atmosphere or life to degrade the impact craters and cover them with plants and etc? \n \n \n\n However, in another thread you talked about \"proof\" of science.

Then they go into the bull**** claims about how their specific religion's dogma hasn't changed (falsely of course) and the circle starts all over again, it is ultimately futile gesture.\nThat's true too. But such claims always give a good laugh, especially since modern creationism arose in the 20th century.\n \nStill I think you got hung over my interchangable use of proof and evidence. There is always something new to learn.\nAs long as you understand that them my point is moot. Maybe it is because I have struggled in teaching the concept to students that I react to \"science has been proved\" statements. I certainly jump all over creationists who ask for proof of scientific theories. They don't understand that it is theoretical that the earth orbits the sun, that hydrogen fusion is the source of the energy from the sun, that gravity (always called a law by creationists) is only a good guess (hypothesis) at this point as far as science knows. Some of the oldest, most strongly supported and stringently tested theories in science are evolutionary theories.\n \n Aside from my quibbles about your initial remarks and claim of proof of science, you seem quite knowledgeable.

That is simply incorrect. My view is a moderate one. Ancient myths and legends are often based on a kernel of truth that is distorted and exaggerated, they are no always outright lies. I am simply interested in finding out what that kernel of truth might be.\n\n \n Well, there is evidence, that is true.

If the contact was mundane enough, it can no way be 'The Exodus'.\n\n No one here is arguing that \"The Exodus\" happened (here I am assuming that you mean something akin to what was written in the Bible), so I don't know why you keep bringing up that point. As for there being a more mundane incident, I am sure there were thousands of mundane incidents - most of which did not involve Israelis - that were too mundane to record in the manner that would be readable thousands of years later. The population of ancient Egypt apparently ranged from about 1.5 to 6 million, depending on the period. If foreign workers from other lands were also coming and going, a few thousand Israelis coming and going, spread out over tens of years would probably not register a tremendous amount of interest. Things that were mundane for the great civilization of Egypt might well have been very significant for the small and relatively insignificant state of Israel. We have to look at perspective here.\n \n As an outline of the changing population of Egypt, from http://lexicorient.com/e.o/egypt_a.htm:\n \nThere have been several waves of immigrations and emigrations over the 2000 years since the decline of Ancient Egypt, not to mention the great influx of foreign peoples during the 3,000 years of the classical period. Ancient Egypt was an attractive place, and traders came from every country of northern Africa, the Middle East and many European countries as well. Many settled, and some left their trace on the Egyptian population from sexual relations with locals.\n Egypt was also attractive to invading armies, soldiers of which often settled in the conquered land and married Egyptian women.\n Slaves represented the third type of immigration. Slaves came from foreign lands, either as trading merchandise or as war prisoners. As both male and female slaves could marry and have children, they also left their mark on the Egyptian population. \n\n With so many people coming and going, why would the Egyptians have considered the fate of a relatively small number of Israeli traders, workers or slaves (hundred or thousands perhaps) as significant? Only significant things were purposely recorded for posterity.\n \n That leaves accidental evidence, where the discovery of the Israeli-style home, though admittedly just a small clue, could still reveal the presence of Israelis in Egypt. Is simply makes sense that a poor people living in a harsh climate might at certain times have had workers working in a neighboring rich country. It happens all the time today. I don't know why you seem to have a mind-set against any Israeli workers being in Egypt.",

   "I think we must be careful about using the word Exodus with the biblical connotations.\n \n I think we can probably agree that a mass migration of many thousands of people in one go as described in Exodus is unlikely.\n \n Often the nomadic groups in those days were fairly small in numbers individually, although there could well be a large number of such groups\n \n I would think it extremely possible that over a number of years a number of the groups may have left Egypt for whatever reason. Could have been religious. Some may have been chased by Egyptian troops.\n \n Eventually after much wandering I believe that they became united under one leader and off they went.\n \n No doubt a long oral tradition remained of this and in the making of the book of Exodus the various journeys became amalgamated into one mass migration under the protection of the Lord arriving and conquering the Holy Land.\n \n AS we ourselves in this day and age can spin and exaggerate small events for political purposes, I do not see that there is any reason why the Exodus could not have been similarly created.\n \n The Exodus as a whole was clearly an important part of Jewish history, but the movemement of small groups of nomads would be utterly unimportant to the Egyptians. They might have been somewhat annoyed if a part of their labour force (i.e. a specific group) took off and sent a force after them, but without much luck.

Looking up Enuma Elish, I don't see nearly as close a correspondence. I am mostly looking at the link:\n http://www.meta-religion.com/World_Religions/Ancient_religions/Mesopotamia/genesis_and_enuma_elish_creation.htm\n and Wikipedia. Anyway, the parallel between the two stories mostly seems to be in the ordering of the stages of creation - six stages followed by rest. Though certain stages and certain orders would have to exist for any creation myth that subdivided creation in to sections, the fact that it was six and not five or ten or three stages does suggest some cultural communication. Such a connection is especially easy to believe since I understand that Abraham started off in Mesopotamia where he and his people certainly would have had access to these stories.\n \n I have always found it fascinating to discover the origins of beliefs and customs and to try to understand the context in which certain customs and beliefs arose. Where Christianity is concerned, the range of early Christian beliefs is amazing - far, far wider than exists today. So much of Christian belief has been shaped by the history and politics of ancient times. It is a fascinating puzzle to try to unravel.",

Note: press cancel on the printer window and article will appear.\nWhat does that have to do with a mythical flood about 4500 years ago? It cudda been! Where does the article indicate that this water ever came to the surface? And if it did, why did it and how and why is it back below the earth. Science is more than just making claims about unrelated hypotheses. You should be laughed at (rightfully) for making such claims without offering any mechanism that brought the water to the surface, dispersed the heat, and returned it to the mantle. Just because you want to believe it doesn't mean it isn't silly.\n \n As has been pointed out, the water, if it came to the surface, would have been superheated and flashed to steam immediately. There is also the fact that the condensation of water in the atmosphere into rain would also have released enough heat to boil the ocean. In order to flood the earth would above the mountains would have required more than 4 times the water now present on earth. If you try to claim that the mountains were just low hills that arose after the flood, then you run into even more heat problems, since mountains are either tectonic (which causes heat) or volcanic (the result of the heat from tectonics). Then you have to find a solution to the problem of the various biota that had to migrate across oceans - if you wish to claim that the continents were all together and them moved at super speeds, then you again run into heat problems.\n \n It makes one wonder how you can fall for this stuff as science without even bothering to learn reality.",

Writing in the second century ce, but basing his account on more contemporary descriptions (now lost), he described a huge grain ship built by Hieron II, king of Syracuse from 269 to 215 bce. Lionel Casson considers this to be the largest ship built in antiquity... There were cabins for 142 first-class passengers on the second deck in addition to accommodations for steerage, the lower deck being reserved for cargo and the upper deck for soldiers, said to number 400. The first-class passengers could use a library, a gymnasium, promenades lined with flower beds, a chapel dedicated to Aphrodite, a reading room, and a bath. Twenty horses could be carried in separate stalls, and there was ample provision for fresh water and a saltwater fish tank for the cook's use. The ship was also heavily armed, being defended by marines stationed in eight deck towers who could fight the ship from the bronze tops of the three masts or from a raised fighting deck. The latter was fitted with a catapult of Archimedes' design capable of hurling an 18-foot dart or 180-pound stone 600 feet. The number of crew is not specified, but the account says that \"although the bilge was extraordinarily deep, it was bailed by only one man using a screw pump, one of Archimedes' inventions.\"\n \n (Excerpt) Read more at college.hmco.com ...\n \n TOPICS: History; Science; Travel\n KEYWORDS: godsgravesglyphs\n The Roman emperor Caligula had a number of 200 ton columns moved from Egyptian quarries to Rome, by ship, suggesting ships larger than this! Lionel Casson notes that the large grain haulers running wheat from the Nile Valley to Rome were also very popular methods of transport for travellers.\n \n Here's another tidbit that speaks to pauls ship wreck that is documented in the book of Acts. This just goes to confirming the accuracy of the bible.\n \n Finding one of these giant grain haulers would add a great deal of knowledge of ancient shipbuilding.\n Examining the Evidence for the Shipwreck on the Munxar Reef\n Associates for Biblical Research\n Mr. Cornuke's investigations on the island of Malta led to the conclusion that the shipwreck occurred on the eastern end of the island of Malta, rather than the traditional site at St. Paul's Bay on the northern side of the island. His view is that the Alexandrian grain ship containing the Apostle Paul and his traveling companion, Luke, was shipwrecked on the Munxar Reef near St. Thomas Bay on the eastern side of the island. Mr. Cornuke claims that he located local spear fishermen and divers who told him about six anchor stocks that were located near or on the Munxar Reef. Mr. Cornuke has suggested that these six anchor stocks came from the shipwreck of Paul (Acts 27:29,40). Four of the anchor stocks were found at fifteen fathoms, or ninety feet of water (Acts 27:28), these would have been the ones the crew threw over first. The other two were found at a shallower depth and he thinks these were the anchors the sailors were pretending to put out from the prow (Acts 27:30). He identifies the \"place where two seas meet\" (Acts 27:41) as the Munxar Reef and the \"bay with the beach\" as St. Thomas Bay (Acts 27:39). He concluded that neither the sea captain, nor his crew, would have recognized the eastern shoreline of the Maltese coast.",

   "Remind me who it was that said earlier in the debate that the main reason why the Ark must, as in has to be[,] a myth is because no multi level boat could ever be built to the dimensions that the Ark claims and hold together. It was either child or SP who said the sheer demand for supports and beams necessary to hold it together would cause its total volume to be filled by those supports and beams making it useless for carrying its intended load. He insisted that the sheer weight of such a vessel would cause it to break in half in the mildest waves or currents due to its inability to flex based on its mass.\nWell, I'm not sure who told you that, but he was pretty much on target. You might be interested in educating yourself further by reading THAT BOAT DON'T FLOAT. Notice the the ships under discussion in that article were 329 ft. and 325 ft. in length. Along with the other 8 wooden keel & hull ships built around this time, they all leaked badly. They were all lost in rough seas. None were ever used as ocean crossing transports. Most were used as coastal haulers. The Great Republic foundered less than 640 miles from the North American coast when she was almost to Bermuda.\n \nHe made this claim as surely as if it was written in the stone of mathematics and supported by all the laws of physics combined.\nIndeed, it is. It's called engineering; in this case nautical engineering (or naval architecture). It has a lot to do with understanding the limits of the materials with which one is working. Wood is just too flexible to serve as either keel or hull of ships of around 300 ft. or more.\n \nWould the mental giant that made such bold and dogmatic statements please explain this ship, the Syracusia from the 2nd century BC ?\nCertainly.\n \n The Syracusia probably wasn't the largest ship from antiquity. I don't know why everyone always ignores the Chinese who had an advanced civilization and a written language long before the alleged flood of Noah. They build huge ships that actually rivaled the ark in size. But they were not constructed according to the plan for the ark in the Bible. They were built from several smaller, water tight modules that were then lashed together. Thus, they could snake and hog without springing the hull.\n \n And of course, the Egyptians also build ships much larger than the Syracusia. They did it by building a series of hulls that were then fastened together with struts that formed several trimarans. On top of this was laid a huge platform that accommodated gardens and temples, etc.\n \n As for the Syracusia, she was undoubtedly impressive for the age in which she was built, but not all that impressive against the Chinese, Egyptian, or American offerings. The Syracusia was about 180 ft. long and has no relevance to the argument that a 450 ft. wooden vessel that exceeds by 50% the structural limits of wood could have survived a 40 day storm and a year at sea.\n \n Nice try. Your other ships aren't that large either. Why do you think that \"large grain haulers\" were as large as the ark?\n \n As for your tidbit about Paul, who cares? How does that show that Genesis is not pure mythology? I suspect that Paul embellished a bit to boot, just as every evangelist from then to now has done. And you accept it all without a single critical question.\n \n Please educate yourself before you speak.",

I for one am sick of playing your dishonest games.\n \n \nSyracusia [Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia]\n Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia ^ | prior to 2006 | Houghton Mifflin\n \n Posted on 01/28/2006 8:46:55 PM PST by SunkenCiv\n \n One of the most complete descriptions of a ship from antiquity is that described by the Greek writer Athenaeus. Writing in the second century ce, but basing his account on more contemporary descriptions (now lost), he described a huge grain ship built by Hieron II, king of Syracuse from 269 to 215 bce. Lionel Casson considers this to be the largest ship built in antiquity... There were cabins for 142 first-class passengers on the second deck in addition to accommodations for steerage, the lower deck being reserved for cargo and the upper deck for soldiers, said to number 400. The first-class passengers could use a library, a gymnasium, promenades lined with flower beds, a chapel dedicated to Aphrodite, a reading room, and a bath. Twenty horses could be carried in separate stalls, and there was ample provision for fresh water and a saltwater fish tank for the cook's use. The ship was also heavily armed, being defended by marines stationed in eight deck towers who could fight the ship from the bronze tops of the three masts or from a raised fighting deck. The latter was fitted with a catapult of Archimedes' design capable of hurling an 18-foot dart or 180-pound stone 600 feet. The number of crew is not specified, but the account says that \"although the bilge was extraordinarily deep, it was bailed by only one man using a screw pump, one of Archimedes' inventions.\"\n",

   "Why would I admit such foolishness ? Have you proven Noah's Ark never existed ? Have you posted even ONE piece of irrefutable evidence that the flood of Noah was copied from the epic of Gilgamesh ? In fact can you even prove that the epic of Gilgamesh was written before Noah lived ? You make these claims as if they're proven facts but only in your small mind are they proven. \n\n Oh, we've never proved it never existed, nor have we claimed it never existed (look who is putting words into someones mouth now, Archie - YOU). It could very well have existed. Noah would just be one of those drowned in the flood, but the ark very well might have existed - it just couldn't have served its actual purpose: you know that whole FLOATING and not breaking up part of its purpose emoticon_rolleyes. \n \n And yes, the little noah myth was copied from the Epic of Gilgamesh, and yes, on this thread, and I believe many others while discussing just with you (not to mention our discussions with SS and other, earlier creationist nuts) have posted multiple, if not innumerable links for you and them. \n \n \n\n You guys are such experts at reversing yourselves, changing what you originally said, and then implying that the new evidence isn't evidence at all. notice the bolded, and that although the ship did leak as any large wooden ship would, the bilge was kept under control by just one man using a screw pump. This completely destroys your claim that such a large ship would 1, just sink from flooding or never hold together 2, require so much support it would never hold anything more than the supports to keep it together. And 3, with multiple decks, a public Bath, fresh water storage, and salt water tanks on board, not to mention stables and provisions for 400 soldiers and 142 First Class guests, this ship was both huge and heavy. You ignored the catapult and the towers for self defense on board. \n\n Ah, so now you are implying that Noah had a bilge on board as well (sure didn't see THAT in the flood myth of the Bible)? And you're ignoring all of them animals (two of EVERY kind - or was it SEVEN, wait, I forgot that the bible can't keep its stories straight)? This does nothing to destroy any claim - this ship is over half as small as the ark is claimed to be, and even here you can see all of the leaking problems. So, apparently, you have to twist the Bible, and add to it (wasn't there a few verses about that being a big no-no?), to maintain your ridiculous views. I'm really not suprised - hint: the bible shouldn't be taken literally, nor seriously - those who do end up twisting and adding to it to maintain their beliefs (not to mention outright lying).\n \n \n\n As usual, you minimize it as if I posted about a row boat and tried to pass it off as a ship. I for one, make no apologies that it was only 180 feet long. That is thought to be the largest ship of its day, so nothing at all to scoff at.\n\n I didn't think you would make any apologies - you don't seem to be one that accepts reality. Noah's Ark is accepted by literalists to have been around 450 feet long. That is WELL OVER TWICE AS :xcensored ING BIG as your \"example\" here - as such, it well exceeds the structural limit of wood.\n \n\n Minimizing any and all evidence that denigrates your assertions is your typical M.O. in debating, rather than actually debating with info that deals with the issues being discussed. You and your compadres are philosophical cowards who deny and obfuscate but never actually deal honestly with any issues you debate.

That is thought to be the largest ship of its day, so nothing at all to scoff at.\nBut at 180 ft. it did not exceed the structural strength of wood. That happens at about 300 ft. There were many wooden keel/hull ships that exceeded 180 ft. For example, Cutty Sark at 212.5 ft., Thermopylae at 212 ft., USS Constitution at 204 ft., HMS Victory at 227 ft. (the gun deck was 186 ft). Victory had a total of 6 decks (guns on 4 of them). And, of course, there was the Wyoming, at 329 ft., as well as her 6 sister ships - all over 300 ft. - all leakers - all foundered in rough seas when the hulls sprung and the pumps could not keep up with the water.\n \n None of them are evidence that the ark was possible. The ark was supposed to be 450 ft. long. I'm not claiming that 180 ft. wooden ships were not possible. Clearly they were. But the structural limits of wood are exceeded at about 300 ft., even if the hull is reinforced with steel cross-bracing, as was the case with the Wyoming, her sister ships, and the Great Republic.\n \n In other words, THAT BOAT DON'T FLOAT.\n \n But wait! There's more! The Bible describes the ark as a big box with no means of propulsion that was supposed to have endured a violent storm for 40 days. In Dec of 1944 the U.S. Navy lost 3 destroyers in a single day from a storm (2 Farregut class destroyers at 341', and one Fletcher class destroyer at 376'). All three of these ships had headway until their engine rooms were flooded. When that happened, the waves turned them sideways to the wave front. Since the wave height was greater than the beam of the ships (34 and 39 ft) they capsized. Only 35 of the crews survived - 775 (or more) perished.\n \n So tell me. How is a bit leaky box going to survive a 40 day storm while the waves are constantly rolling it over and over?",

Modern ships turn bow to the wave front. The three destroyers lost power due to flooding and were unable to keep their bows into the waves. The were turned broadside and capsized.\n \n The book and movie, \"The Caine Mutiny\" eventually come down to the 1944 typhoon. The author served aboard a Navy vessel in that storm.

   "Beg to differ, old bean. Didn't God say that the rainbow was a sign that He wouldn't again destroy the Earth by flood? That's totally different to saying that the rainbow is a sign that the next destruction is by fire. (Gen 9: 11 - 17.)\n\n \n I must beg to differ old bean. The passage below is also part of the bible and speaks directly to the point i was making. In verse 7 below, it say's by the same WORD the present heaven and Earth are reserved for fire. That will take place at the end of this AGE and usher in a new one in which sin will no longer exist. This isn't according to my will or ability, but by God's who is in control of this Spiritual Battle humanity is involved in. At least some of us are involved in it. Others don't even know a battle is taking place which makes them Dead On Arrival as Casualties of War (spiritually speaking of course). Thanks for the attempt to correct me though but I know what the WHOLE bible says regarding the last days. Not just bits and pieces.\n \n \nYou have to realize, however, that those of Archangel's kind like to twist and add to the bible, especially when it means talking about destructon by fire, etc. I think that it gets them off to hear about destruction and devestation.\n\n \n That the World will be destroyed by fire the next time is neither my wish or hope SP. But as usual you must lie and defame without any interest at all in what is true or scriptural. If the passage below had your name on it, it couldn't be more relevant to you and the other scoffers here. If you had a soul you would read it and weep. Instead you will use it to mock me as a fool who is ignorant enough to actually take the bible literally. So have at it, I welcome your scorn and condemnation.\n \n 2Pe 3:1 \n Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.\n 2Pe 3:2 \n I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.\n 2Pe 3:3 \n First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.\n 2Pe 3:4 \n They will say, \"Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.\"\n 2Pe 3:5 \n But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water.\n 2Pe 3:6 \n By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.\n 2Pe 3:7 \n By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.\n 2Pe 3:8 \n But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.\n 2Pe 3:9 \n The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.\n 2Pe 3:10 \n But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare.[fn1]\n 2Pe 3:11 \n Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives\n 2Pe 3:12 \n as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming.[fn2]That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.",

You should know that even though the fire wasn't referred to in the Genesis passage it was mentioned throughout the bible just as Peter stated it in conjunction with referring to the flood. \n \n It seems to me that someone knowledgeable with the overall message and flow of the Word would have agreed with my message rather than try to imply it was wrong, as if God's intent wasn't to destroy the World by fire at the end of this Age.\n \n \nAfter 'the war of the great day of God the Almighty', paradise will be restored to the planet that God originally made. Satan, his demons, and all his followers (those who refused to knuckle under during the 1000 year reign of Christ) will be banished for eternity - the second death.\n \n\n \n What do you mean by satan and his demons who refused to knuckle under during the thousand year reign of Christ ? It sounds like you're saying satan and his demons will be free for that thousand year reign and nothing could be further from the truth. After the Tribulation Period ends, the Lord will cast satan and his demons into the lake of fire for a thousand year reign when the lion will lay with the lamb. The Earth will live in total peace with Christ as our rightful and righteous King.\n \n Only after the tribulation saints who have lived and produced offspring that will live for that thousand years of total peace and righteousness, and actually be schooled and educated from studying the books of the lives of the saints of this Age to learn and understand the nature of sin and temptation without actually living within its grasp. Only then, after a thousand years of peace will the beast and his angels be freed once more for a period of time to once again tempt that part of humanity as a final purging of those who have actually lived in total peace and harmony but some will follow satan and only after that purging is complete and satan and all who followed him from that Age of peace will be forever thrown into the lake of fire which \"then\" is referred to as the SECOND DEATH. After that there will be no more evil forever and God's Creation will be as it was originally intended.\n \n Of course the bible gives no time frame on this but if we go by God's normal type M.O. then that final spiritual struggle with Satan's last rebellion will probably last another thousand years or so. Another millennium which is an AGE. And charlie, I too have studied revelation and end times prophecy in depth.",

Noah and his family were still direct descendants of Adam so they possessed the Adamic nature if you will, as do all who were descended from them. Sin still reigned within the soul of humanity and we still possessed the spirit of rebellion that comes with the sin nature. Where as the Old Testament Hebrew custom of sacrificing an unblemished lamb to temporarily cover sins was practiced, God sent the perfect Lamb of God whose sacrifice was an acceptable sacrifice once and for all time to all who receive Him. He was the man Christ Jesus.\n \n So without Christ there is no salvation unless one can live a perfectly sinless, righteous life according to Gods standards of Holiness and perfection which no human has been able to satisfy yet.

   "The rainbow means no more destruction (of the world of mankind) by global flood. Peter and Revelation talk about destruction (of the world of mankind) by fire i.e. the second death (from which there is no resurrection.) Ergo, according to Arch's ignoratio elenchi, the rainbow meant subsequent destruction of the Earth by fire. We'll put it down to semantics. emoticon_xhoho\n\n \n You are just plain wrong in your assertion of the fire at the end of this Age reflecting the second death. You don't understand the timing, or at least the accepted Theological interpretations of the end times at all because you're excluding much of what will take place. Re-read my post above as it explains it in as simple terms as I could explain it. \n \n \nIf the Flood account is allegorical, then Christians are wholly deluded in believing it actually happened \n\n \n And if it isn't, who is deluded then ? \n \n \nSatan transforming himself into an angel of light doesn't happen to Christians, apparently).\n\n \n Those who receive Christ and possess the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of God CANNOT be possessed by the devil.

On the contrary, I learned plenty about the Bible and Christianity. I revelled in it. The real learning comes when you stand outside the box and look in, and analyse dispassionately. No one wants to die if they've got their marbles and health. In those circumstances, very few want to choose when and how to die. I want to live forever. There's a lot to learn.

But if one truly receives the Holy Spirit, they must literally command it to leave them and it then would do it meaning they have committed the unforgivable sin and would be lost forever.

You tell me what you think is scriptural and then I'll tell you what I think is scriptural. \n \n Rom 5:10 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.\n Rom 8:24 For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?\n Rom 9:27 Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel: \"Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, The remnant will be saved.\n Rom 10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for *Israel is that they may be saved.\n Rom 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.\n Rom 10:13 For \"whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved.\"\n Rom 11:26 And so all Israel will be *saved, as it is written: \"The Deliverer will come out of Zion, And He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;\n 1Cr 1:18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.\n 1Cr 3:15 If anyone's work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.\n 1Cr 5:5 deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.\n 1Cr 10:33 just as I also please all [men] in all [things], not seeking my own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved.\n  \n \n \n \nNope.

Paul is speaking to the Church at Corinth and telling them to be reconciled to God. It isn't even about reaching out to the unsaved who seek to disprove God and mock Him or the believers who follow Him. Here's verses 15-21. See if you can understand it in its proper context.\n \n 2Cr 5:15 \n and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.\n 2Cr 5:16 \n Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer.\n 2Cr 5:17 \n Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.\n 2Cr 5:18 \n Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation,\n 2Cr 5:19 \n that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.\n 2Cr 5:20 \n Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.\n 2Cr 5:21 \n For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. \n \n So what does this have to do with being nice to people who distort and lie about what the bible say's ?

   "You can only claim this if it is accepted that the Bible is completely literal and is opposed by Science which has its own measuring stick.\n\n \n Which Arch has done and in his mind claimed that science opposes, contrary to the beliefs of many of us who believe that the bible (along with various other religious texts and beliefs) can be reconciled with science.\n \n \nForgive me if I remind you that there is a vast array of people in the world who accept the teachings of the Bible even if they are sceptical or maybe doubtful as to its accuracy as a historical document.\n\n \n That's not the problem here. Arch argues that Genesis happened in a literal sense. The problem is that there is no evidence for Genesis in a literal sense. Therefore we have a problem. So either God did Genesis as the bible states in a literal fashion and he covered all evidence up (which makes him a deceiver), or that he created a world different from Genesis again which makes him a deceiver. God as a deceiver is heretical to Christanity. This point has been made to Arch several times. He refuses to deal with it. \n \n \nYelling at people and calling them liars isn't a lot of help and rather childish.\n\n \n When he posts Fox tv props as proof of creation and uses known lies, calling him a liar is merely stating the obvious. We all know that no one is going to convince Arch of anything. The poor man can't tell the difference between a petri dish and welsh Corgi. What we can do is expose the flaws in his evidence and his beliefs. His outright hostility towards people examining his belief scares me though. Also one can be honest with believing that God is a liar. Arch has huge gapping holes in his theological beliefs in the context of reality. He has stated that sciences that deal with billion year old things are 'fairy tales.' I made several comments about geology to him the context of finding fossil fuels. He hasn't addressed a single one. For creationists, it is simply easier to do what is easy (run away) then deal with theological problems in their belief systems.",

   "@ Arch - \nPaul is speaking to the Church at Corinth and telling them to be reconciled to God. It isn't even about reaching out to the unsaved who seek to disprove God and mock Him or the believers who follow Him. Here's verses 15-21. See if you can understand it in its proper context.\n \n 2Cr 5:15 \n and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.\n 2Cr 5:16 \n Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer.\n 2Cr 5:17 \n Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.\n 2Cr 5:18 \n Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation,\n 2Cr 5:19 \n that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.\n 2Cr 5:20 \n Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.\n 2Cr 5:21 \n For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. \n\n Interesting that 'proper context' is your version. You've really lost the plot, Arch. And obfuscating a Biblical passage does you no credit. Yes, surrounding verses can supply a context, but not always necessary. Let me enlighten you.\n \n I'm sure you can recall 2 Tim. 3:16 - All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness. WHY? ... that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.\n \n Clearly you should be able to see that more than one piece of learning can be had from a particular Scripture. If you want to learn about certain problems within the congregation at Corinth, you can view surrounding verses. If you want to learn about the qualities expected of a Christian, you can look at 2 Cor. 5:20 and see that Paul and other evangelisers considered themselves ambassadors for Christ. Now link that to 2 Tim. 3:16 and you may begin to see what qualities are expected of a true Christian.\n \n \nSo what does this have to do with being nice to people who distort and lie about what the bible say's ? Didn't Jesus throw the money changers out of the Temple when they were treating it like a business ? There's such a thing as righteous indignation and it isn't a sin.\n\n Christ overturning the tables of the money changers was a display of righteous anger. So remind us again who displayed this anger. That's right. Christ. Your's isn't righteousness indignation, your's is self-righteous anger.\n \n Prov. 21:23 - He that is keeping his mouth and his tongue is keeping his soul from distresses.\n Eph.4:29 Let a rotten saying not proceed out of YOUR mouth, but whatever saying is good for building up as the need may be, that it may impart what is favorable to the hearers. 31 Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from YOU along with all badness.\n Romans 12:17 Return evil for evil to no one. Provide fine things in the sight of all men. 18 If possible, as far as it depends upon YOU, be peaceable with all men.\n James 3:13 Who is wise and understanding among YOU? Let him show out of his fine conduct his works with a mildness that belongs to wisdom.\n \n Why, Arch? Col. 1:10  in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing [him] as YOU go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God, \n \n You're not a Christian, Arch. None of the above Scriptures apply to you. You just enjoy stirring up contention. And what sort of Christian has the temerity, pretentiousness and self-righteous arrogance to call themselves Archangel? By what stretch of the imagination can you equate yourself to Christ?\n \n If you want to debate, then debate. But you need to regain the plot you lost a long time ago.",

   "For correction and further clarification, you have completely misrepresented what this verse means. Here it is in context with the verses that come before and after it.\n \n Mar 3:26 (Jesus speaking) \n \"And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.\n Mar 3:27 \n \"No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.\n Mar 3:28 \n \"Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter;\n Mar 3:29 \n \"but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation\"--\n \n The bolded is the passage you posted to imply that Christians can lose their salvation. The passage actually is about blaspheming the Holy Spirit and how that is an unforgivable sin, which a believer would never do. \n \n Now ask yourself this ! Are those people who have right here on this thread and forum, blasphemed the Holy Spirit by mocking and insulting me as an ignorant fool for claiming and insisting that God Himself indwells me by the power of His Holy Spirit ?\n\n \n \n Address Luke and Matthew also, they omit that part and are about the same instance. I'd says the passages are about how demonic possession can come about...after all, that's what the Christ is doing, casting out a demon.\n \n What I'd have you do is disregard non-Christians whom never knew the Holy Spirit and focus on yourself and your possible sins, the sins that bind. Spiritual Pride could be possible. http://www.inchristalone.org/SpiritualPride.htm\n \n Of course, this is the Internet and it's difficult to discern the meanings of another in course written form but self inspection could be warranted if many state you appear to have issues with humility.",

Why the hypocrisy and double standards if elevating the quality of debate is your goal charlie ? Why judge just the Christian and hold us to a higher standard when on the other hand you spend all your time disproving our beliefs ?

And if its true that God created us with free will which even the Angels don't have, then how would we know we were free to reject Him if evil did not exist as an opposing option for humanity ? This is why the bible points out that we are in a Spiritual Battle and uses so many military comparisons to our lives as children of God. \n \n Life can simply be defined as a battle between Good and Evil, and Jesus said that you are either for me or against me. There is no in between, no sideline so to speak. If on thinks they can go through life in neutral, they are in for a rude awakening. \n \n So consider this. We are the only creatures in Gods creation with free will. And our struggle with the sinful nature is the battle field upon which we must choose and determine which NATURE/WILL we will follow. And the temptations and struggles with the sins of this World are the price we must pay to determine which nature we will follow, which will determine our eternal destination, which for those who choose the higher nature will be above the Angels in Eternity. \n \n Those who choose the lower nature will suffer with them in the hell that was created for Fallen Angels, not Man. But the people who end up there will have consciously chosen seperation from God by mocking and rejecting Him in life just as you do constantly in so many posts. You have every right and freedom to reject Him, just understand that it is you rejecting Him and not the other way around when you find eternal seperation from Him is your reality.\n \n \nAnd of course you run into the problem of how anything in GODs universe can in fact occurr without his willing it directly or indierctly.

Surely he did not do it by accident did he?\n\n \n Eph 1:4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,\n \n This verse plainly say's that God chose us who will follow Him through Christ before the foundation of the World. Which means He knew us before He created us or the World we live in.\n \n 1Pe 1:20 He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you \n \n \n This verse say's plainly that God foreordained Messiah/the Christ, before the foundation of the World, which means He always understood our struggle with sin would force a choice by us to choose Good or Evil while in this body of flesh. And Jesus was the answer to the sin nature who would defeat death and give eternal life to all who believed in Him.\n \n As for causing Adam and Eve's Fall from Grace. He didn't cause them to eat the forbidden fruit of the knowledge of Good and Evil that cost humanity our innocence. He plainly warned them that on the day that they ate of its fruit they would SURELY die. They understood clearly the price for disobeying that one warning in the garden. And His reason was to protect them from the pollution of a sinful nature which we fully understand the downside of possessing as their descendants.\n \n As to the Great Flood, it is clearly your personal judgment as a person with a sinful nature that the flood was a sinful act. If satan himself were being interviewed, he, no doubt, would say the same thing. But that doesn't make it a true statement at all, only your opinion. The bible say's that Fallen Angels/sons of God as they were referred to, mated with human women creating a so called super race of humans which infected and corrupted humanity so that it had to be destroyed and purified. This was the reason for the Flood; to save humanity, not to destroy it. \n \n If God wanted to destroy you and me, He would have wiped out all life, not just the infected and corrupted life on Earth. But of course from your limited and Worldly perspective you would also have a shallow and limited perspective of Gods reasoning and actual true agenda which motivated His actions.\n \n Gen 6:2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.\n \n Gen 6:4 There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore [children] to them. Those [were] the mighty men who [were] of old, men of renown. \n \n \n His only other option was to destroy all of humanity all together but that would have meant satan would have succeeded in destroying Man who was made in Gods image which has been his goal since our creation. He promised that he would never serve man which got him bannished as heavens #1 Archangel.\n \n On a side note, the fact that a race of Giants was produced from this activity means that God didn't destroy them imediately at all. He allowed this to existe for a period of time which no one knows the amount of time of. But I personally believe this explains the ancient, yet unexplained ruins of great Cities found by Archeologists and under the Oceans that we have no historical records of. They are pre flood civilizations that no descendants existed any longer to speak of. You can be sure that Evolutionists have no explanations for the existence of the unknown, yet rediscovered ruins of such Civilizations.",

   "Originally Posted by AA \n So consider this. We are the only creatures in Gods creation with free will. \n\n \n \nOriginally Posted by lesz \n Manifestly untrue. Any self-activating organism has free will, if it is not operated by another as a marionette. That's as true of bacteria as it is of people. As long as you aren't a slave to some other entity, such as a god, you have free will.\n \n\n \n \nOriginally Posted by AA \n Dogs don't build homes and pigs haven't figured out how to fly yet\n\n \n Before we fly too far asunder, perhaps we should narrow down what is really meant by 'free will'\n \n For me the best way to get closure on the concept is to eliminate those that are least supportable. So, saying I start with Theological concepts of free will.\n \n \nFirst we define the theological free will playing field\n The theological doctrine of divine foreknowledge is often alleged to be in conflict with free will. After all, if God knows exactly what will happen, right down to every choice one makes, the status of choices as free is called into question. If God had timelessly true knowledge about one's choices, this would seem to constrain one's freedom.[85] This problem is related to the Aristotelian problem of the sea battle: tomorrow there will or will not be a sea battle. If there will be one, then it seems that it was true yesterday that there would be one. Then it would be necessary that the sea battle will occur. If there won't be one, then by similar reasoning, it is necessary that it won't occur.[86] This means that the future, whatever it is, is completely fixed by past truths-true propositions about the future.\n \n However, some philosophers follow William of Ockham in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.[87] Some philosophers follow Philo of Alexandria in holding that free will is a feature of a human's soul, and thus that non-human animals lack free will.[88]\n \n Jewish philosophy stresses that free will is a product of the intrinsic human soul, using the word neshama (from the Hebrew root n.sh.m. or .&#1504;.&#1513;.&#1502; meaning \"breath\"), but the ability to make a free choice is through Yechida (from Hebrew word \"yachid\", &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1491;, singular), the part of the soul which is united with God, the only being that is not hindered by or dependent on cause and effect (thus, freedom of will does not belong to the realm of the physical reality, and inability of natural philosophy to account for it is expected). In Islam the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's jabr, or divine commanding power. al-Ash'ari developed an \"acquisition\" or \"dual-agency\" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine jabr were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant Ash'ari position.[89] In Shia Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward predestination is challenged by most theologists [1]. Free will, according to Shia Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. All actions taken by man's free will are said to be counted on the Day of Judgement because they are his/her own and not God's.\n \n The philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.[90] As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because \"the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free.\"[91] Alvin Plantinga's \"free will defense\" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and evil are consistent.[92]\n\n \n Then we tear it asunder.\n \n \nThe firs limb\n Some philosophers follow Philo of Alexandria in holding that free will is a feature of a human's soul, and thus that non-human animals lack free will.[\n\n \n Self fulfilling prophesy with no evidence. How did Philo know that animals other than humans had no soul? Only human have souls he asserts.\n \n OK.\n \n If humans have souls where is it? No evidence for its existence anywhere in humans. some say it was the pineal gland, but, not, that little baby seems to be responsible for such as growth. No soul evidence there.\n \n But, heck, let's assume for a moment that humans have souls which is a requirement for free will. If there is no good evidence for free will, then how can humans have souls, one might ask. \n \n For evidence on this track we look to such as Benjamin Libet who demonstrated that action was signaled before one was conscious of making a decision. Pretty powerful stuff there.\n \n If you want to see this stuff go to neuroscience under free will in wikipedia: \n \n As for AA arguments about dogs and pigs, that may go to ability to manipulate things with tools, but as evidence for free will, not really. Finches in the Galapagos use tools to get at food (ants and termites) and most birds build nests, ants build colonies and empires (see stuff on the 800 mile long colony in Europe), small invertebrates (Coral) are responsible for reefs, So even the tool limitation is not operative.\n \n Several species are demonstrably self aware (Dolphins, Parrots, some Apes), so that restriction on animals is kaput as well.\n \n There is just no scientific evidence for soul, in fact there is no scientific evidence for free will. There is no scientific evidence that animals are different from humans in any soulful, free willful way.\n \n If you want to go to rituals, I think its the fact that humans exhibit ritual and answer giving behavior like animals do rather than the other way around.\n \n As for self activating being a sufficient criteria for 'free will' as lesz argues, that is going to take some additional refining and defining. I'm sympathetic to the notion that any behaving thing (viruses and plants are included) is self activating in the sense that it is an entity among entities. As such what it does with respect to other entities should be treatable at the level at which the entities interact. However , even these kinds of limitations are subject to interpretation and definition.\n \n But, hey, let the battle of wills begin.",

But its rather obvious that abiogenisis did occur - even if it was due to divine intervention (assuming GOD is not a living organism and thus had to arise somehow himself).

   "First of all, Identify for me a \"self activating organism\" please ?\n\n \n It's any organism which can initiate its own actions internally, without any external stimulus. It could a be a fruitfly or a clergyman. I wasn't referring to origins of life, but to notions of \"free will\".\n \n \nEvery organism in existenstence is the result of a chemical reaction which resulted from the interaction of other organisms before it. How could someone who's religion is science not be aware of that ?\n\n \n First of all, life had to have a beginning somewhere, and that beginning is in prebiotic chemistry. Where else could it come from? Someone waving a magic wand? If so, where did that someone come from?\n \n Second, science isn't a religion. It's method even you could use, only you have to choose to use it rather than ignore it. Your the religion specialist here.\n \n \nBesides, every organism such as you refer to like bacteria act and exist within physical laws that they can't over rule according to their own will because they have no will or thought processes at all. They are mindless organisms.\n\n \n Apparently this will come as a total shock to you, but you too are an organism acting and existing within physical laws that you can't over-rule according to your will. If you think you can, I invite to live without eating, or try stepping off a high building and floating gently to the ground without a parachute. You can use the laws of nature to accomplish takss with tools that you couldn't do otherwise, but you cannot go outside them. A number of animal species have similar tricks to extend their unaided abilities.\n \n Does this limitation mean that you are a mindless organism? Sorry, but the reason a bacterium is mindless is because it doesn't have a brain, but it can process and transduce information, and it is capable of initiating actions, though without a brain it can't be conscious of them. A clergyman, on the other hand, has a brain and therefore a mind, though often they aren't put to much use.\n \n Of course, it's much easier to demonstrate cause and effect in a bacterium than in a clergymen, for example, but still, materialism is still at the root of both their actions. If a clergyman has \"free will\", so does a bug. Of course, if you want to dispense with the notion of \"free will\", I'm ok with that, too.\n \n \nI am speaking about creatures with brains and definate wills, yes; but not free will to act outside of their given natures which is why Dogs don't build homes and pigs haven't figured out how to fly yet. They are bound by their natures.\n\n \n Of course all animals are bound by their natures, and operate within them. This is as true of humans as of dogs or fruitflies.\n \n \nBut man, even though we weren't created with wings have learned to fly, or gills yet we have conquered living under the Sea, or even though we must breathe air with lungs, we have learned to survive in the vacuum of Space. That is the definition of free will.\n\n \n No, Archie, that isn't a good definition of \"free will\". It's in the nature of humans to learn, to understand and use the laws of physics, and to make tools. But lots of other animals have similar faculties, only not nearly as well developed. Chimps make and use simple tools; so do some birds. It isn't a uniquely human trait, as you would know if you kept abreast of the lit.\n \n \nNo lesz, you have shown here you don't understand the true nature of life at all by claiming that organisms are self activating, and that they have free will to act outside of their specific design without the interaction of other organisms.\n\n \n Nope. No animal can act \"outside its design\", not even humans, and I'm a lot closer to understanding the nature of life than any bibliolator who worships the bible and ignores science. So far as anyone can tell, animals have as much freedom of will as people. What they don't share to the same extent is consciousness, but even there, many are pretty self-aware. Consciousness is not the same as freedom of will. All freedom of will means, so far as I know, is that volition is internally activated, according to the laws of physics and chemistry, without an external stimulus. IOW, volition is autonomous (meaning free from external causation), and humans and certain other animals experience consciousness of this volition. That's all we know for now. We do not know for sure, for example, whether consciousness drives activity or is merely aware of it afterwards.\n \n \nAnd isn't it interesting that you choose just a couple of sentances and change the subject of such a long post that I wrote. You seem so determined to never discuss the meat of anything I write, but to focus on secondary tangents instead.\n\n \n Usually you write about religion, theology and nebulous stuff like that. I prefer discussing biology on these boards. When you make the occasional on topic post, I am always happy to set you straight! emoticon_xangel",

Decades and decades ago, I went to a small Presbyterian Girl's college. We had to take Bible studies. What we learned, then, was modern Biblical scholarship. We learned that there were 4 primary writers of the Torah: The first is the Yahwist, who is the oldest writer. For him, Yahweh is a very anthropomorphic being who walks around on earth with Abraham and Adam and others. Writings from this very early period are not clearly monotheist. Yahweh is the God of the Jews, but there are other gods, that Jews are forbidden to worship. \n \n The Yahwist wrote the second creation story in the Bible: The Adam and Eve Myth. The second is the Elohist, who wrote much later. For him, G*d is not so anthropomorphic, much more ethereal. You will find the Yahwist and the Elohist woven throughout Genesis and Exodus. The third is the Priestly Writer. He is later than both the Yahwist and the Elohist. He is generally concerned with writings about Temple practice, but he wrote the creation story you find in the first verses of Genesis: \"In the beginning . . . . \" In this version of creation, Man and Woman are created simultaneously in the Image of God. In the vision of this writer, G*d is neither male nor female - a much more sophisticated vision of the Divine. \n \n The fourth writer is the Deuteronomist, who, well, wrote the Book of Deuteronomy. \n \n Anyway, I have recently become interested in Jewish thought, and one of the best books I have read is Jonathan Kirsch's The Woman who Laughed At God. He verifies what I learned years ago, and provides much more detail. I would suggest that you read him. But there is nothing in it that suggests that it records actual events.",

The name pantheist was introduced by John Toland (1670-1722) in his \"Socinianism truly Stated\" (1705), while pantheism was first used by his opponent Fay in \"Defensio Religionis\" (1709). Toland published his \"Pantheisticon\" in 1732. The doctrine itself goes back to the early Indian philosophy; it appears during the course of history in a great variety of forms, and it enters into or draws support from so many other systems that, as Professor Flint says (\"Antitheistic Theories\", 334), \"there is probably no pure pantheism\". Taken in the strictest sense, i.e. as identifying God and the world, Pantheism is simply Atheism. In any of its forms it involves Monism, but the latter is not necessarily pantheistic. Emanationism may easily take on a pantheistic meaning and as pointed out in the Encyclical \"Pascendi dominici gregis\", the same is true of the modern doctrine of immanence. \n ==============================",

   "As for a global flood, such a spectacle is unfeasable. For starters there is simply not enough water on the planet to cover the surface: Even if the ice caps melted, about 20% of the planet's surface would still be land covered.\n \n Okay let's assume that water magically appeared and disappeared within forty days. How does this explain the millions of giant natural structures, such as mountains and caves? We've all been to the beach when we were kids, and we've all made sand castles with walls that we thought would repel the incoming tide. But within half an hour, the sand is completely level with the surrounding beach, the original structure gone. Same goes for a flood. How does a structure such as, say, uluru, or roraima?\n \n The point is, a flood of such porportions is just impossible. Remember who wrote Genesis: the Jews. They lived in Levant - an area near the place where asian - african - arabian tectonic plates collide with eachother. All this activity could lead to tsunamis of massive sizes - any survivor would have thought that the world had undergone the same cataclysmic fate. All it takes is a scholar to record the history, and we don't know how much later one came about - until then, the story circulated by word of mouth. This leaves plenty of room for error (a funny example is the story of how much weight George Clooney gained to play his role in Syriana - I was told it was 50 pounds or so, and when the topic came about a few weeks later I didn't really remember how much it was so I said 55 - I later checked online only to see it was thirty pounds, what a letdown).\n \n By the way, don't forget a similar story - Atlantis. Some people have become so obsessed by its mystery that they forgot who wrote the original text - Plato. Locations of Atlantis range from the Caribbean to Borneo, but who wrote the original idea? A Greek philosopher. We have to limit the areas to what he knew - the Old World knew nothing about Indonesia. Similarly, the Jews didn't know much of the surrounding areas, they could easily have assumed it was also under large amounts of water.",

   "It looks like the science based people here need some help. So I'm going to hit back. \n \n 1) A global flood, if it did occur, would have left fossils of every species in every strata as it laid down sediment. We should find all over the world, the same species in the same strata. No where on Earth do you find fossils of dinosaurs, mastodons, Precambrian shellfish and primates in the same strata. The flood was thought to have been extremely violent; churning up huge volumes of water this would have mixed the carcasses of species into one homogenous layer, advanced creatures with less advanced all whirling around in the cacophony of death together. While heavier species would have sunk faster, we should see more or less homogenous strata all over the Earth. This occurs nowhere on the planet. \n \n 2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth. No such layer of sediment exists for that time period. \n \n 3) The necessary water to cover the Earth would have been astronomical. The oceans cover roughly 2/3rds of the Earth. That is sea level, to cover the highest point, Everest (29,028 feet feet above sea level), would require JUST to raise sea level, 756,821,205 Cubic miles of water. \n \n The fundemental problem is that the Oceans, seas and bays make up 96.5% of total water on the Earth and they only have 321,000,000 cubic miles. That leaves a huge amount of water that would need to come from somewhere. \n \n http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/DanielChen.shtml \n \n There's simply isn't that much water on Earth to allow such a flood. \n Some argue that the mountains weren't that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. That's 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earth's core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earth's core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. That's way more then the surface of the Sun. \n \n 4) The global flood says that the world was covered by water. The problem with that is such an infusion of water would have created brine. As the water receded and evaporated, huge amounts of salt would have remained on the land. Very few plants can grow on salted Earth, and those who can are not agricultural crops. Virtually every creature in the oceans has a low tolerance for salinity change. A slight change can result in massive dieoffs. That would mean, as the salinity rapidly changed, that many creatures, if not virtually all would have died from osmosis. That means Noah would have had to keep two of every species of oceanic creatures onboard the ship. Given the measurements, the boat cannot hold two of every whale and shark. Even worse, as most of the oxygen comes from algea and seaweed, the change in salinity and pressure would have killed off the producers of oxygen. Life simply couldn't exist after a flood of such proportions. While some modern species can survive in salinity conditions very different then their norm, most cannot survive for extended periods of time, such as 40 days. Furthermore, their prey sources often cannot survive that long as well. Even more alarming is that if the alga managed to survive, the death of billions of life on Earth would have resulted in decay which results in nutrients which would have resulted in alga explosions like no other, removing oxygen from the oceans, suffocating every living thing left. \n \n 5) Some say that the water came from underground, a mile to be percise. The problem with that is the water would be superheated. Releasing 756,821,205 cubic miles of superheated water would have boiled everything to death almost instantly. The oceans would have also boiled away, killing all marine life, fresh water lakes would have done the same. The mantle of the Earth is 100 Celsius. Therefore the steam would be roughly that hot. That's 212 degrees Fahrenheit. 756,821,205 cubic miles of 212 degree Fahrenheit water in a world that is typically no hotter then 80 degrees average would be instant death to everything. \n \n 6) Finally, flood geology requires the compaction of 4.5 billion years of comet, asteroid and meteor strikes into a single year. The problem with that is the energy from such impacts would have to be compacted as well, and we all know that the energy is converted into heat. \n \n 3 x 107 kg x 4.5 x 109 years worth of meteorite flux \n =1.35 x 1017 kg of meteoritic material fell during the flood year. \n \n The energy imparted by this amount of material is equal to: \n 1/2 M V2, where M is the mass of the extraterrestrial material, and V is the velocity at which it falls to the Earth (equal to the escape velocity, or 11200 m/s). This gives: \n 1/2 (1.35 x 1017 kg) * (11200 m/s)2 \n = 8.5 x 1024 Joules. \n \n So the Earth's atmosphere would have had to accomodate 8 x 1024 J of energy from this falling meteorite matter. We can do a quick calculation to determine the amount of heating this would cause: \n \n Energy = Matmo * Cp *(T), where Matmo is the mass of the atmosphere (5 x 1018 kg), Cp is the pressure constant for air (about 716 J/kg * K for N2), and T is the temperature change of the atmosphere. Solve for T: \n T = Energy/ (Matmo * Cp) \n = 8 x 1024 J / ((5 x 1018 kg) *716 J /kg * K) \n = 2,400 K. \n \n So the temperature change of the Earth's atmosphere would be about a 2,40 K increase in a single year. That's over 3860 Fahrenheit. \n \n The flood never happened and by proxy creation as well....\n\n \n 1) The simple answer to this statement is that when the flood did arrive, it did not only mix up thousands of species of animals and plants, but also the many layers of strata in the Earth. This would have caused a severe change in the appearance of the strata, which has obviously confused modern scientists all over the world.\n \n 2) Like stated above, everything would have been mixed up, not just the creatures.\n \n 3a) If you do the math, severe earthquakes (caused by God) could have very easily covered the Earth in approximately 2 miles of water at some points. Also, with these severe earthquakes, not all of the Earth would have to be covered equally at one time. There could have been some parts shallow enough to actually see the ground below.\n \n 3b) Who said the Earth started out as a flat super continent? I believe that God made the Earth only a few thousand years ago, not that much geographically different from the way it is now.\n \n 4) The 'waters of the deep', as the Bible puts it, could have very well been the supply (with the correct salinity levels) of the first oceans. In the beginning, God could have supplied the Earth with a large 'hydrosphere', between the crust and the outer layer of the mantel. Its sheer size would have stopped it from condensing or evaporating until the time when God chose for the flood to come. Any animals currently in fresh or slightly salty bodies of water could have made the simple survival adaptations on there own for a month, or with God's help.\n \n 5) I have answered most of this statement above, but you must also take into account the incredible cooling that must have occurred when boiling-hot water came into contact with billions of cubic miles of next-to-freezing rainy air. You get the picture.\n \n 6) Actually, all it really required is a small tap from God's little toe.",

   "3a) If you do the math, severe earthquakes (caused by God) could have very easily covered the Earth in approximately 2 miles of water at some points. Also, with these severe earthquakes, not all of the Earth would have to be covered equally at one time. There could have been some parts shallow enough to actually see the ground below.\n \n 3b) Who said the Earth started out as a flat super continent? I believe that God made the Earth only a few thousand years ago, not that much geographically different from the way it is now.\nYou contradict yourself. If the earth was then much as it is today, then there isn't enough water on earth to cover it in any fashion. I have done the math. Do you have any idea of how high the Himalayas, the Alps, the Andes, and the Rockies are? Besides, the Bible talks about a flood that lasted a year, not a series of tsunamis.\n \n4) The 'waters of the deep', as the Bible puts it, could have very well been the supply (with the correct salinity levels) of the first oceans. In the beginning, God could have supplied the Earth with a large 'hydrosphere', between the crust and the outer layer of the mantel. Its sheer size would have stopped it from condensing or evaporating until the time when God chose for the flood to come. Any animals currently in fresh or slightly salty bodies of water could have made the simple survival adaptations on there own for a month, or with God's help.\nTypical of \"creation science\". \"It cudda happened!\" Is there a single item of empirical evidence that supports your fantasy?\n \n5) I have answered most of this statement above, but you must also take into account the incredible cooling that must have occurred when boiling-hot water came into contact with billions of cubic miles of next-to-freezing rainy air. You get the picture.\nAs has bee pointed out, you propose too much water to be cooled below the temperature of superheated steam. If the \"waters of the deep\" were under great pressure, then upon release to the atmosphere, it would have flashed to steam, thus greatly heating the atmosphere. The \"rain cooled atmosphere\" wouldn't have existed simply because the temperature would already have been above boiling because of the release of latent heat from the condensation of all that water that was falling as rain. Contrary to what you believe, the condensation of rain from vapor heats the atmosphere at altitude. So you have condensation of water both above and below that is releasing latent heat.\n \n Your turn to do the math. There is approximately 332,500,000 cubic miles (1,386,000,000 cubic kilometers) of water on earth. If you calculate how much additional water would be required to cover Mt. Everest (about 4 times existing water), you will have the total amount of water that condensed from vapor. Now calculate the amount of latent heat that would have been released from that water (80 cal/cc if all of it were at exactly 0 degrees C.)\n \n And there are other heat problems for \"creation science\". Of course, you have already denied the heat from runaway tectonics (that most \"creation scientists find necessary). It seems that you don't realize the huge problem of bio-geography that such an idea would cause you. How did the kangaroos and wombats get to Australia?\n \n And then there's the problem of the heat released by cramming 3.6 billion years of radioactive decay into 6,000 years. You can find a discussion (complete with the math) in the article Were Adam and Eve Toast? by Dr. Joe Meert, a geologist at the U. of Florida. Notice that scientists actually \"do the math\" and show it to you. They don't just make claims. If you want, I'll show you the math involved in all of the water calculations - I just figured that you wouldn't understand it anyway.\n \n OK. Now we are looking for you to do the math from your original claim, and the math that answers my objections.\n \n6) Actually, all it really required is a small tap from God's little toe.\nRight.

   "It looks like the science based people here need some help. So I'm going to hit back. \n \n 1) A global flood, if it did occur, would have left fossils of every species in every strata as it laid down sediment. We should find all over the world, the same species in the same strata. No where on Earth do you find fossils of dinosaurs, mastodons, Precambrian shellfish and primates in the same strata. The flood was thought to have been extremely violent; churning up huge volumes of water this would have mixed the carcasses of species into one homogenous layer, advanced creatures with less advanced all whirling around in the cacophony of death together. While heavier species would have sunk faster, we should see more or less homogenous strata all over the Earth. This occurs nowhere on the planet. \n\n \n Many modern creationists would argue that the strata is a deposition order, and the fossil order is a burial order. They might say that specific places on earth where volcanoes and tectonic action were likely to occur had similar climates and therefore similar biological systems. \n \n Gen 7:17 \u00b6 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. \n 18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. \n 19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that [were] under the whole heaven, were covered. \n 20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. \n \n Gen 7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. \n \n It seems to indicate that it took 40 days for the whole earth to flood. Creationists would interpret this to mean that the water levels increased for 40 days until all the earth was covered. That means there would have been opportunity for some animals (perhaps those with more stamina -- such as mamals) to find higher ground for about a month's time. The bigger, slower animals (such as dinosaurs) would not have been able to keep up. The Bible says \"the fountains of the great deep\" were broken up and water came out of the earth. \n \n \n2) The global flood should have left homogenous sediment layers across the world, similar to the Iridium layer that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs left on the Earth. No such layer of sediment exists for that time period. \n\n \n Creationists would probably say that the order of sediment layers represents the order of catestrophic deposit. For example, when Mt. St. Helen blew in the 80's it laid down layers that looked very much like \"yearly\" strata layers... but thousands of them in just hours. Creationists would predict finding different layering based on the different types of catestrophic forces in that area. Was there volcanic activity in that area? Was there tectonic activity in that area? Was there earthquakes, how fast did that area flood... these would all have varying effects on the sedimentation process. Additionally, creationists would argue that water run off from the continents would have also played a significant role in sedimentation (ie Grand Canyon). [/quote]\n \n \n3) The necessary water to cover the Earth would have been astronomical. The oceans cover roughly 2/3rds of the Earth. That is sea level, to cover the highest point, Everest (29,028 feet feet above sea level), would require JUST to raise sea level, 756,821,205 Cubic miles of water. \n\n \n Mt Everest - at its very tip - has marine fossils. Why? Well simply put, it wasn't always there. Creationist models show a much more level earth. They would argue the oceans were not as deep, and the mountains were not as high. They would argue that there isn't a place on earth you can go and NOT find marine fossils, suggesting that at some point every place on earth was covered with water. It doesn't prove that they were all covered at once, however. \n \n \nThere's simply isn't that much water on Earth to allow such a flood. \n Some argue that the mountains weren't that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. That's 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earth's core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earth's core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. That's way more then the surface of the Sun. \n\n \n Creationists use an illustration. Lets say you are bending a metal bar. It's very difficult and the place where the bend occurs builds heat. However, once you reach a certain point, it becomes incredibly easy to bend, very little force is needed as long as it keeps moving. The friction is exponentially decreased. Heat remains constant, no longer building. However, if you slow down too much, your piece of metal will loose it's heat and begin to harden. \n \n Creationists would also argue that you are using a common fallacy called \"uniformitarianism\". That is to say you are taking a measured value and extrapolating it back into the past. The problem with this is there is no way to tell that the rate has remained constant throuout time. For example, if we take a look at the earth's magnetic field, we see that it is shrinking at a regular rate each year. However, if we simply extrapolated that backwards at the same rate, the field would have been too powerful for life to exist just 15,000 years ago. The same goes with the Moon's orbit. It is gettting farther and farther away from the earth at a measurable rate. If we assumed (as the uniformitarian does) that the rate never changed, the moon would be touching the earth less than 50,000 years ago. Creationists use this argument effectively against millions of years of strata deposition. \n \n \n4) The global flood says that the world was covered by water. The problem with that is such an infusion of water would have created brine. As the water receded and evaporated, huge amounts of salt would have remained on the land. \n\n \n Creationists would argue that for this to be measured and calculated, one would have to know how much salt was in the oceans when they were created. Perhaps they were created without any salt in them. Perhaps the salinity of the oceans is a result of the solution that would have occured at a cataclysmic global flood. \n \n \n5) Some say that the water came from underground, a mile to be percise. The problem with that is the water would be superheated. Releasing 756,821,205 cubic miles of superheated water would have boiled everything to death almost instantly. \n\n \n Creationists would argue that rain has a super-cooling effect. Additionally, any solution has a higher boiling point than water alone. What would be the cooling effect of a rain storm over the entire surface of the earth for 40 days and 40 nights? As a matter of fact, many ice age models begin with the flooding of an area. \n \n 6) Finally, flood geology requires the compaction of 4.5 billion years of comet, asteroid and meteor strikes into a single year. The problem with that is the energy from such impacts would have to be compacted as well, and we all know that the energy is converted into heat. [/quote]\n \n You have a lot of calculations there, and the creationist would ask what assumptions you are making. For example, are you assuming - as the uniformitarian does - that the rate of compaction has always been the same as what is seen today? Are you making any assumptions as to how much material was here to start with? Are you making assumptions about the material itself? Who observed all this material falling to the earth?\n \n \n \nThe flood never happened and by proxy creation as well. That however, does not invalidate Christanity as many Christians view the bible as a moral and value oriented book, not a accurate history book.\n\n \n I would disagree with you. I would say that if any part of the Bible were untrue, that would discredit the whole. You see the Bible claims to be the infalible Word of God. If it's claims about itself are wrong, how can we trust that it's claims regarding morality carry any weight?\n \n Jhn 3:12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you [of] heavenly things?",

If God is a liar, then the Bible is not the word of God and cannot be trusted. \n \n Consider this excercise in logic:\n \n If God is who he says he is in the Bible, and his very voice created the universe, then can God lie?

Imagine if you had that kind of power in your voice. Whatever you said became true for all eternity. If you contradicted yourself, one reality would be destroyed for another, wouldn't it? If God said \"let there be light, and there was light\" where light had not been before, then what would happen if God were to lie about the earth? Wouldn't the former be destroyed and the new become reality?\n \n In the Bible, Jesus says \"I am the way, the Truth, and the light\". How can someone \"be\" the truth, unless they are a God with the power of creation in their voice.

   "http://www.biblicalgeology.net/\n \n Here is a creationist geologist. However, I think many creationists would point out that volcanism, tectonic movement, heat, and pressure are some of the processes that can create metamorphic rock, and that all of these processes are involved in all of their flood models, as well as continuing today. \n \n \n \n A creationist might point out that you wouldn't expect to find a moose fossil with a crocidile fossil, even though they are contemporary creatures. This is because they do no live together in the wild. They would continue to argue that not being buried together during a catastrophe does not prove they didn't live on the earth at the same time, but only that they weren't together at the time of the catastrophe. \n \n \n \n Well that is a problem for the ardent creationist isn't it? Or for any Christian. The Bible says that God cannot lie. \n \n Tts 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; \n Num 23:19 God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? \n \n You see the Bible says that God promises never to send a flood to destroy the whole earth again:\n \n Gen 9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. \n \n If the flood were a local flood, as some say, then God is a liar. There have been many local floods througout history. If God is a liar, then the Bible is not the word of God and cannot be trusted. \n \n Consider this excercise in logic:\n \n If God is who he says he is in the Bible, and his very voice created the universe, then can God lie? If light didn't exist, and then God said let there be light and light then existed -- if there is that sort of creative power in the Word of God -- can God lie? Imagine if you had that kind of power in your voice. Whatever you said became true for all eternity. If you contradicted yourself, one reality would be destroyed for another, wouldn't it? If God said \"let there be light, and there was light\" where light had not been before, then what would happen if God were to lie about the earth? Wouldn't the former be destroyed and the new become reality?\n \n In the Bible, Jesus says \"I am the way, the Truth, and the light\". How can someone \"be\" the truth, unless they are a God with the power of creation in their voice. You see, if any part of the Bible is a lie, then the whole idea of God and Jesus comes crumbling down like a house of cards.\n\n \n God didn't write the Bible.\n \n People wrote it to the best of their understanding. They can be mistaken in their understanding.",

   "Sorry but I must have missed it, but I thought that the 6000 year figure was what some bishop had worked out ?\n\n \n Creationists use geneoligical records in the Bible which go from creation to Jesus Christ in about 4004 years. As a matter of historical record, most agree that Jesus was on the earth about 2000 years ago (perhaps 2007 years ago?), hence approximately 6000 years. \n \n \nLots of us don't take the Old Testament too seriously as anything more than a set of morality and origins tales dating from the Bronze Age or even earlier.\n\n \n Two points here; first, that is not what the Bible claims itself to be. It claims itself to be the infallible Word of God. Secondly, the truth is unaffected by popular opinion. With new evidence, or better interpretation of existing evidence comes a change in the popular perception of the truth. Each of us has an opinion on the truth based on our worldview. That worldview effects how we process or interpret the evidence we see. \n \n Consider: creationists and evolutionists have the same rocks, the same fossils, the same \"evidence\". Both interpret that evidence differently to support their presuppositions in light of their understanding of the world in which they live -- basically filtered through the lens of their worldview. \n \n For the creationist, the Bible is their list of presuppositions. For the evolutionist, materialism, naturalism, and uniformitarianism are the underlying presuppositions. Presuppositions are required for interpretation of evidence who's formation was unobserved.",

Additionally, there would be a lot of weight on the crust pushing it downward into the void. \n\n \n Creationist \"models\" are pure fiction with no science to back them up. They exist solely to explain away the vast errors found in literal interpretations of the bible. They are good for a laugh, but no more.",

   "Many modern creationists would argue that the strata is a deposition order, and the fossil order is a burial order. They might say that specific places on earth where volcanoes and tectonic action were likely to occur had similar climates and therefore similar biological systems.\n\n \n Except that the flood story is massively violent with a ocean covering sea. Too bad that we have absolutely no evidence of this and we have a fossil layer that in no way supports such as asinine view of the world. The burial layer alone refutes the flood. If it was true, we should see similar mass organisms in the same layer. That means all of the similar sized shell fish, primitive and complex in the same layer and we should see larger organisms at the bottom and smaller at the top. What we actually have is a completely different burial layer with large organisms spread through out the entire column and only found in specific parts. We see a burial column by complexity, not by mass. Fluid mechanics has always screwed up flood models. \n \n \nGen 7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.\n\n \n This alone ends life almost entirely on the planet as salts deposited would prevent plant life and the change in salinity killing off most of the algea and sea weed. \n \n \nIt seems to indicate that it took 40 days for the whole earth to flood. Creationists would interpret this to mean that the water levels increased for 40 days until all the earth was covered. That means there would have been opportunity for some animals (perhaps those with more stamina -- such as mamals) to find higher ground for about a month's time. The bigger, slower animals (such as dinosaurs) would not have been able to keep up. The Bible says \"the fountains of the great deep\" were broken up and water came out of the earth.\n\n \n You haven't done much research have you. Water from within the earth would be superheated. Releasing double to fourtimes the amount of water we have now would have killed all but the most thermophilic bacteria. No more Noah. Secondly, the whole stamina argument makes even less sense as marine organisms would have all had the same chances, and therefore should be in the same layer. Not true. \n \n \nCreationists would probably say that the order of sediment layers represents the order of catestrophic deposit. For example, when Mt. St. Helen blew in the 80's it laid down layers that looked very much like \"yearly\" strata layers... but thousands of them in just hours. Creationists would predict finding different layering based on the different types of catestrophic forces in that area. Was there volcanic activity in that area? Was there tectonic activity in that area? Was there earthquakes, how fast did that area flood... these would all have varying effects on the sedimentation process. Additionally, creationists would argue that water run off from the continents would have also played a significant role in sedimentation (ie Grand Canyon). \n\n \n Are you seriously putting that forward?\n \n The grand canyon was not flood formed.\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH581.html\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH550.html\n \n The necessary volcanic activity to produce even sediment layers on par with the Iridium would be somewhere on a super volcano which hasn't erupted in over 600,000 years. \n \n \nMt Everest - at its very tip - has marine fossils. Why? Well simply put, it wasn't always there. Creationist models show a much more level earth. They would argue the oceans were not as deep, and the mountains were not as high. They would argue that there isn't a place on earth you can go and NOT find marine fossils, suggesting that at some point every place on earth was covered with water. It doesn't prove that they were all covered at once, however.\n\n \n No, it but it does prove that plates move. The creationist model, primarily burmagarder's (SP?) relies on miracles. He even admitted it. To make Everest that tall in less then 5,000 years requires movement on the scale of feet per year, and I mean over 5 feet per year. The accompaying earthquakes, tidal waves, volcanic activity and general rise in heat would have been noticed by someone. Furthermore, we'd be seeing it today. There's no way it could stop so suddenly after moving so fast for thousands or so years. \n \n \nCreationists use an illustration. Lets say you are bending a metal bar. It's very difficult and the place where the bend occurs builds heat.\n\n \n What are you talking about? \n \n \nHowever, once you reach a certain point, it becomes incredibly easy to bend, very little force is needed as long as it keeps moving. The friction is exponentially decreased. Heat remains constant, no longer building. However, if you slow down too much, your piece of metal will loose it's heat and begin to harden.\n\n \n How can heat remain constant when the rate of movement is steadily increasing? And how are you going to explain the massive slowing of plates from 6 feet a year to 1 inch? \n \n \nCreationists would also argue that you are using a common fallacy called \"uniformitarianism\". That is to say you are taking a measured value and extrapolating it back into the past. The problem with this is there is no way to tell that the rate has remained constant throuout time.\n\n \n Aside from their being evidence that it did. Besides, if there was a change in rate, we'd see the evidence similar to how the magenetic field has switched every couple hundred million years or so. There's no reason to assume there was a change without evidence. \n \n \nFor example, if we take a look at the earth's magnetic field, we see that it is shrinking at a regular rate each year. However, if we simply extrapolated that backwards at the same rate, the field would have been too powerful for life to exist just 15,000 years ago. The same goes with the Moon's orbit. It is gettting farther and farther away from the earth at a measurable rate. If we assumed (as the uniformitarian does) that the rate never changed, the moon would be touching the earth less than 50,000 years ago. Creationists use this argument effectively against millions of years of strata deposition.\n\n \n You are either lying or are decieved.\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/magfields.html \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/moonrec.html\n \n \nCreationists would argue that for this to be measured and calculated, one would have to know how much salt was in the oceans when they were created. Perhaps they were created without any salt in them. Perhaps the salinity of the oceans is a result of the solution that would have occured at a cataclysmic global flood.\n\n \n Are you serious? No salt? Right because the fossils we found have structures that are designed for salt water when there was no salt. And salt found in old rocks known to have been on the ocean floor didn't exist? Are you insane? Ever try putting a fresh water fish in a salt water tank? Seriously. Creationism = retardation. \n \n \nCreationists would argue that rain has a super-cooling effect.\n\n \n Except that it doesn't\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html#flood\n \n \nYou have a lot of calculations there, and the creationist would ask what assumptions you are making. For example, are you assuming - as the uniformitarian does - that the rate of compaction has always been the same as what is seen today? Are you making any assumptions as to how much material was here to start with? Are you making assumptions about the material itself? Who observed all this material falling to the earth?\n\n \n You're right, I'm off. it should be higher as there was more rock material in the solar system then before. Uniformitarianism is wrong here was we know there was more material. Thus the heat issue is even greater. \n \n \nI would disagree with you. I would say that if any part of the Bible were untrue, that would discredit the whole.\n\n \n Does the term metaphor mean anything to you?",
