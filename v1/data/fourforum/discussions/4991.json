   "It seems that most political analysts agree that the Democratic Party has suffered dramatic downfalls during the past decade....Once championed as the party of main street America Democrats are increasingly aligned with the screwball politics of the Radical left wing...\n \n Consider moveon.org, the web base PAC largely financed by billionaire George Soros....After funneling tens of millions of dollars to the Democratic Party the head of moveon.org, Eli Pariser, claimed \"We bought it we own it we are going to take it back\". ......Say goodbye to the centrist Democrats, hello to the new age of Howard Dean....\n \n This \"Paradigm Shift\" of the Democrat Party can be seen in Washington D.C....Having lost control of the House and the Senate over issues such as homeland security, gay marraige and gun control, some minority Democrats increasingly use the tactics of obstruction and the psychology of contempt to force their minority opinions on the majority of Americans.\n \n The answer seems obvious: while moveon.org, George Soros and Howard Dean \"Take back\" the Democratic Party, we others will continue taking back America.........",

As for Dean, the failure of the party to get across that he ran a Fisically conservative government and held off most radical change in vermont is a reason people like you think he's far left when he practices more conservatives measures then most Republicans.",
