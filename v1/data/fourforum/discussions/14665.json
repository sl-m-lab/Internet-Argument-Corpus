   "Besides unemployment being high and showing no signs of real decrease (the official number falling because people have been unable to find a job for so long that they are deleted from the labor pool does not count), the fact is that the fed is basically out of ammunition that may actually be helpful and has pretty much turned to hail mary type maneuvers that will almost certainly come back to bite the middle class in the back side in a big way. \n \n FT.com / Investor's notebook - Economic outlook: Data set to shed light on easing\n \n \nThe US Federal Reserve has been in wait-and-see mode after flagging the possibility of a second round of QE at its latest policy meeting, and the minutes of that on Tuesday could provide further insight into a timetable and under what conditions the central bank would act.\n \n \"Of the Fed officials who appear to be advocating or hinting at the possibility of additional QE, many appear to cite the notion that economic conditions don't have to deteriorate further, they simply need not improve,\" says Robert Lynch at HSBC.\n \n Data from the US this week include manufacturing output from one of the crucial industrial regions, reflected in the Empire State index. Production in New York has been volatile of late, and Friday's report is likely to show this trend continuing. \n\n \n Here is the problem with quantitative easing at this point. IT can take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years for the \"positive\" impact of quantitative easing to filter down to your average middle class American. It takes about 12 days for quantitative easing to impact commodity prices. That means that the QE that the fed is considering doing MAY help out the middle class in the long term, but in the short term it will increase the price of oil/gas, food, electricity, pretty much everything you actually need to live in the US today. \n \n So, when you see the fed talking about QE, and you see commodities and even the stock market rally because of it, keep in mind that commodities are rallying because the fed it doing all it can to debase our currency, and the stock market is rallying because somehow the geniuses there have decided that moves by the fed that will immediately cut consumers discretionary spending by 10-30% (depending on whose numbers you like) will be great for corporate america.\n \n The exception is financial stocks. Those actually SHOULD be rising. Why? Because the REAL bailout was not TARP. The REAL bailout was 0% interest rates to borrow from the fed. Banks are borrowing at 0-.5% from the fed and then turning around and putting it in treasuries at 2.35%. Do that with 50 or 60 billion at a time and you have packed in enough risk free money to make all that bad MBS paper look like nothing....especially since the FED started allowing the use of MBS paper as collateral for loans. You take your junk paper, use it as collateral for the fed, borrow a bunch of cash, put it into treasuries, then just keep rolling the loan over. No problem. \n \n QE is pretty much the only arrow the fed has in their quiver. Does anybody actually believe for even one minute that driving the middle class to bankruptcy is going to help the economy???\n \n IMO the FAR more likely explanation is that the fed is essentially trying to tank the dollar to make the US labor more competitive against foreign labor. There has been a lot of talk lately about potential currency wars. IMO the fed is already fighting one.",

Perhaps that should explain a lot about why we are doing what we are doing. \n \n I'm probably middle class and my house is worthless even after I bought it as a foreclosure (for less than the builder charged to build it I might add). For the first time in my life I'm strongly considering investing in only foreign investments. They seem to be getting to the point where they can withstand the hit if the US goes off the cliff.",

   "I know. I cant seem to get it through my head that explaining it in simple terms is not going to be enough to get Americans to take an interest. The fact they are being completely and totally screwed apparently does not phase them. The fact that the head of the federal reserve literally testified in front of congress that the first thing he does every morning is to check on treasury prices because he is afraid they, and the US economy with them, have crashed overnight does not seem to phase them. The fact that the last head of the GAO resigned in disgust after he could not get congress to understand that the US stands a VERY REAL risk of turning into the worlds biggest third world nation and is not out on a self funded tour of the country trying to get people to understand that doe not have any impact on them at all. \n \n It is pathetic. Do you have any idea how badly my kids, and yours, are going to have to suffer because of the apathetic attitude of the american sheeple today?

This is probably my only compliment to date for the tea party is that they do seem to get people more interested and reading about our founding principals. The down side is that the leaders prey on this ignorance. So you get Palin or Obama (to be fair) up there and they talk the talk but then their ideas are the complete opposite. I personally blame the leaders over the followers because it is the ones that have the ability to lead that should be doing the right thing. Preying on trust is pretty evil and no doubt this is what we see today.",

But I noted even in your posts I don't see any solutions...only talk about what is wrong. Are there any real solutions? Can anything realistic be done to turn our nation around?\n\n \n Don't short change yourself, you seem to got a pretty good understanding from you wrote here. Maybe not the technical aspects but not everyone needs to know that. What I was getting at in my above post was that we all have roles to play. Some people are leaders, some are thinkers, some are the soldiers. People put a lot of trust in the leaders so for them to abuse that is basically evil. Now you got some Joe Blow's realizing they've been had and are seeking people to fix that. The major problem is the people their to \"fix\" the problem are the same ones that created it and are rebranding themselves to gain the trust. It is sick if you think about it.\n \n What can Joe Blow citizen do?\n more than you think. I'd ask people to think in simple terms and try to remove any previous bias you had. Next, think about how you would run your own life and then apply that to the government. Would you spend twice as much as you brought in during a given year? Would you lend $50k to a college student majoring in art? How much more money have you received by lowering your income and increasing your spending? Finally, think about who you would trust more to make certain decisions. Do you trust a close friend or a boss four levels higher than you more? That might depend on the situation. Probably the boss to make decisions over the entire company and your close friend on what to eat for lunch that day. That is the entire idea behind federalism. Details at the local level and high end stuff at the federal level.\n \n In short, if you think in terms of your own life it might become more clear.\n \n Will voting one particular way in coming elections help?\n No. The Tea Party started with amazing ideas and thoughts and was perverted by old republican leaders rebranding themselves and manipulating the minds of the followers.\n \n Will it help to stand outside with signs and protest?\n No. Getting a job would help though. Stop thinking you (general you) are so important that you are above certain jobs. Just because you are a US citizens doesn't mean you are entitled to the newest Apple product. \n \n Will it require armed conflict against these insitutions to turn things around?\n Has before. Let's hope not. If the Middle Class starts worrying about the Middle Class than they stand a chance. Let the wealthy worry about their tax rate...they are fine, be a little selfish on that one.\n \n Will we have to wait for 20 or more years and starve through another great depression?\n Who knows\n \n Is America as we have historically known it over\n \n I don't think so but no need to wait for it to get to that point.",
