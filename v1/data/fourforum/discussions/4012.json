   "Official: U.S. may strike at Baathists in Syria \n 12/24/2004 10:45:00 AM GMT \n Bush accuses Syria of providing the Iraqi resistance with money and manpower\n \n \n The U.S. is considering launching military strike on Syria in an attempt to kill or capture Iraqi Ba'athists, it says are behind the attacks against U.S. targets in Iraq, a senior administration official told The Jerusalem Post on Friday. \n \n The official added that new U.S. sanctions are likely to be implemented. However, he said that U.S. should be more \"aggressive\" after Tuesday's attack on a U.S. base in Mosul. \n \n The officials remarks suggested that the U.S. believes the attack on the mess tent, in which 22 people were killed, was planned from inside Syrian territory. \n \n \"I think the sanctions are one thing. But I think the other thing [the Syrians] have got to start worrying about is whether we would take cross-border military action in hot pursuit or something like that. In other words, nothing like full-scale military hostilities. But when you're being attacked from safe havens across the border - we've been through this a lot of times before - we're just not going to sit there,\" the senior administration official said. \n \n \"You get a tragedy [like the attack in Mosul] and it reminds people that it is still a very serious problem. If I were Syria, I'd be worried,\" he added. \n \n Meanwhile, another U.S. official said that sentiment reflects a \"growing level of frustration\" in Washington at Syria's reluctance to capture Ba'athists and other operatives, the U.S. claims are organizing attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq. \n \n However, the official cautioned that taking cross-border military action is still a matter of discussion and that a military incursion is still \"premature.\" \n \n The senior official noted that the U.S. frustration increased substantially after last month offensive in Fallujah, which revealed \"how much of the insurgency is now being directed through Syria.\" \n \n However, the U.S. hasn't presented any evidence up till now regarding the extent to which attacks are being organized by Syria. \n \n On Thursday, a report in The Times of London claimed that Syria has become a base for Iraqis to operate. It, moreover, accused Syrian of being involved in those attacks targeting U.S. forces. \n \n The Post reported on Sunday that the U.S. gave Syria with a list of names of people that Washington would like to see arrested. However Syrian authorities haven't responded to the U.S. demand up till now. The Post quoted a senior government official predicting a confrontation with Syria \"unless the Syrians reverse their policy.\" \n \n The U.S. already deploys some of its troops along the Syrian border with Iraq, conducting air and mobile patrols. \n \n Earlier this week, Bush threatened Syria, saying with new pressures, saying \"we have tools at our disposal, a variety of tools ranging from diplomatic tools to economic pressure. Nothing's taken off the table\". \n \n \"We will continue to make it clear to both Syria and Iran that ... meddling in the internal affairs of Iraq is not in their interest,\" the president said after talks with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. \n \n In an interview with a Lebanese newspaper, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage echoed Bush's threat of new sanctions, saying that Washington wanted Syria to arrest or kill fugitive officials of the former Iraqi regime, who remained at liberty in Syria and who \"seem to us to be responsible for funding anti-U.S. attacks in Iraq.\" \"We want them to turn off this faucet,\" said Armitage.\n \n No immediate plans for new U.S. sanctions \n \n Despite President George W. Bush's recent warnings to Iran and Syria against \"meddling\" in Iraqi affairs, the U.S. has shown no sign of readying new sanctions.\n \n Bush repeated his warning on Monday, saying that Washington had a variety of diplomatic and economic measures it could take against Syria.\n \n The U.S. accuses Syria of providing the Iraqi resistance with both money and manpower. \n \n State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that Washington constantly reviews the Syrian Accountability Act enacted last year to stop Damascus' alleged support of \"terrorism\". \"But I don't have anything new at this point,\" he said. \n \n However, officials said that Syria has shown some signs of cooperation in helping to crack down on funding for anti-American fighters and tightening its border patrols. \n \n Syrian authorities have arrested about 2,000 people for trying to cross its border with Iraq.\n \n http://www.aljazeera.com/cgi-bin/news_service/middle_east_full_story.asp?service_id=6428\n\n \n When I read things like this, I can't help but wonder......Is our president really THAT stupid? \n \n For those who are a little confused, think back real hard to the \"syrian responsibility act\" which was passed by our congress and signed into law by Bush. It declared economic and trade sanctions against Syria. The SAME WEEK, the Eu signed a new trade agreement with Syria. The end result of our sanctions has been that Syrian comapnies doing business with US companies were free to cancel teh contracts and renegotiate with EU companies. Syria made or saved almost half a billion dollars in doing this. In addition, Us oil interests in Syria (which were specifically excluded from the sanctions) are now paying the syrian goverment several billion dollars per year above what their contracts require in order to keep the syrians from canceling thos e contracts, since the oil companies are representatives of a hostile nation. \n \n The EU has already announced that they would no be taking part in any sanctions against syria now or in the forseeable future. They are, in fact, planning to have fully liberalized trade relations with syria within 10 years. \n \n So, what do you think the Bush administrations plan is here? Do you think they will push for more sanctions against syria, knowing full well that it will do nothing but prove that the US has lost the power to impose effective sanctions? Do you think that we are actually foolish enough to attack Syria militarily, knowing that it would likely ignite anti american retaliation on a global scale? Surely even Bush and co, delusional as they may be in such matters, do not believe that we can waltz in and take over syria, do they?",

The US would have absolutely no legal reason to attack Syria.

In the meantime, our military has proven itself most inefficient in holding even a relatively small nation, even with fairly significant suppport from portions of the population.\n \n We have already declared sanctions against Syria, which the EU promptly invalidated, in fact INCREASING arms sales to syria and signing a trade agreement with them.\n \n In the mean time, we are doing quite a bit of sabre rattling at the UE in general, as they make moves to lift the arms embargo on China. We are threatening to suspend the transfer of military technology to EU nations. My question on this one is, since over 80% of our military components come from overseas (EU and Japan), does this mean we are going to quite arming our soldiers?\n \n I really do think that the last time we saw this kind of \"we don't need the rest of the world and we will simply take what we want\" mentality it was coming from Hitler.",

How are mr and mrs yuppie going to react when they realise they can no longer afford to feed their kids?\n \n Fear of terrorists and terrorist attacks seems to be based not on the actual casualties of those attacks, but on the possibility that following such an attack the US public may take a good, hard look around and see the problems we are facing here, as well as the likely impact of those problems in the end. I think the nightmare sceanrio for most of these folks is a nuclear attack on washington that takes out congress and (if we are lucky) the president. The American people, being the stupid, gullible, non thinking sheep that we are, NEED a government to tell us what to do in order to avoid absolute pandemonium. Most Americans have gotten so used to being babysat by big brother that just the thought of having to provide their own healthcare of provide for their own retirement is terrifying to them. \n \n I get FEMAs newsletters and ops books. They have doen some interesting studies. According to Fema, in the event of a major catastrophy that interrupted major services for 2 weeks (power, gas, water. etc...), over half our population would die from either starvation, disease, or cold. It seems that Americans are actually so stupid that in the event that they turn on their tap and no water comes out, they can't figure out where to get a drink of uncontaminated water. We are so ignorant that if they can't pass a bag with a big mac though the drive up window of Mc donalds, we can't figure out where to get food. If the furnace doesn't kick on at 68 degrees, the majority of Americans apparently can't figure out how to stay warm without asphyxiating themselves. \n \n I can't help but wonder if a society that dependant on their gadgets, gizmos, and government subsidized services is even worth preserving.",

While the smart thing to do would be.....never mind. We are NOT going to do the smart thing. It seems to me that Bush and co are still stuck in the mindset that a lot of folks around here are, that the US is untouchable (I should post that over in the thread where we are discussing likes and differences between the current war and vietnam). If this is truly their mindset, I think it is very likely that we will eb rolling into Syria or Iran before this thing is over. \n \n If they have learned anyhting form the war in Iraq, and it has been a slightly humbling experience (as well it should be), then this latest little temper tantrum is likely just a show of bravado. \n \n I think the answer will largely depend on how the media handles the situation. If the media snaps it up and runs with it, I think there is a better than average chance that we will attack Syria. I don't think that a limited show of military might is an option because I don't think syria will stand for it. A strike inside of Syria would certainly increase their support for the Iraqi insurgents, and possibly even get Syrian special forces into the act, attacking Us forces inside Iraq, and Syrian special froces are considered some of the best in the world. In us special forces training if you wash out you get sent back to your unit. In syrian special forces training you either make it or you die trying. Backing from a nation like syria for the insurgents could very well mean the difference between victory and defeat for the US.",

Some were generated by internal mismanagement, others due to external forces, and many as a result of internal and external circumstances. \n \n Using England as an example, that empire was already in a position of heavy debt due to the US taking much of their industrial production with cheap labor, a transfer of the influx of new national wealth, and the financial maintenance of their far-flung colony structure. WW2 quickly drained the remainder of their national wealth and forced them to regroup. I don't know if the US, with our massive size and ever-increasing public dependence on government, has the financial ability to gracefully regroup without a crash of some sort. One thing is certain, US leaders have no hesitation in using public money to perpetuate the myth of our former wealth being intact.",

   "I sometimes gather from your various posts that you are convinced that the US is on the brink of a social and economic catastrophe. I often feel that way myself on the scale of Western society in general. \n But I think we might expect the cynical politicians to avert the consequences of present day financial/social follies by mortgaging the future and by borrowing money that will have to be repaid in the next generation and beyond. To take an instance, the war in Iraq will eventually present a bill for x billion dollars - but who cares ? People living 50 years hence will pick up the tab.\n\n \n This depends largely on how long other countries are willing to finance our debt and prop up our currency. It appears that we are nearing our limit on the national credit card. The last major issue of treasury bonds went unsold. The US government was forced to buy them. This is not a good thing. We are rapidly reaching the point where we are no longer able to simply pass the tab to the next generation. We can't even move long term bonds anymore, short term are our best sellers. This means that the debt we incur today will have to be repaid in our lifetimes (unless you are very old and planning on dying in the next 5 years, since the 5 year bond has been the most popular), or refiananced, assuming we can even move the new issues. \n \n On the brink of an economic catastrophy.....undoubtedly. On the brink of a social catastrophy.....it will depend on how people handle the economic catastrophy.\n \n \nI cannot paint a brighter picture on behalf of any European economy (apart perhaps for Norway where special factors operate). All Western societies are spending far more than is being earned. Expenditure on social welfare for example is increasing everywhere when it ought to be diminished. \n Before you slide \"gracefully into gentile poverty\", what measures would you be prepared to tolerate in order to adjust American expectations to what can be afforded ? An increase in taxes ? A decrease in ......well, what ?\n\n \n I can. A large amount of the debt being taken on by european nations is expansion related. The Europeans, particularly the EU nations, are taking positive steps to rectify their problems. They are doing all they can to expand their manufaturing facilities, openeing new markets, and making their deals to assure that they have cheap labor for future expansion. \n \n It is hard to tell exactly what will happen there, mostly due tot he emergence of the EU. For the first time you can effectively treat Europe as a single entity in regards to trade. We have never done this before, so it is difficult or impossible to make predictions based on past events in regards to their sucess. \n \n Personally I am optomistic about the future of the EU. The Euro is one of the strongest currencies out there, and is being touted by many as one of the most stable since the base is spread across so many nations, making it difficult for foolish decisions of a single governement to affect it. In addition, they have a lot to offer to third tier nations, which seem to be the emergent consumer markets of tomorrow.",

   "When I read things like this, I can't help but wonder......Is our president really THAT stupid? \n \n For those who are a little confused, think back real hard to the \"syrian responsibility act\" which was passed by our congress and signed into law by Bush. It declared economic and trade sanctions against Syria. The SAME WEEK, the Eu signed a new trade agreement with Syria. The end result of our sanctions has been that Syrian comapnies doing business with US companies were free to cancel teh contracts and renegotiate with EU companies. Syria made or saved almost half a billion dollars in doing this. In addition, Us oil interests in Syria (which were specifically excluded from the sanctions) are now paying the syrian goverment several billion dollars per year above what their contracts require in order to keep the syrians from canceling thos e contracts, since the oil companies are representatives of a hostile nation. \n \n The EU has already announced that they would no be taking part in any sanctions against syria now or in the forseeable future. They are, in fact, planning to have fully liberalized trade relations with syria within 10 years. \n \n So, what do you think the Bush administrations plan is here? Do you think they will push for more sanctions against syria, knowing full well that it will do nothing but prove that the US has lost the power to impose effective sanctions? Do you think that we are actually foolish enough to attack Syria militarily, knowing that it would likely ignite anti american retaliation on a global scale? Surely even Bush and co, delusional as they may be in such matters, do not believe that we can waltz in and take over syria, do they?\n<P<\n \n Hello Daewoo! , and how're you'll doing on this blessed nite? but! I was just thinking along with the above issue, every since as you've mentioned, but! , are you aware of this issue also? : .... \n \n http://www.aljazeera.com/cgi-bin/news_service/middle_east_full_story.asp?service_id=6428 , \n \n or is it the same thing?\n \n because if it is, then that would make your questions very relevant, but to realize, I think since the trading between those countries introduces another issue of conflict: \n \n So, since! , this matter involves not only Syria, but Europe, China, Lybia, Pakastan, North Koria, and other countiries also, \n \n but in answer to just one of your questions, and with these views also, I would say in answering, that the course of this matter will be as fortold with the power struggle at hand, or by to impose effective sanctions, \n \n and No! , I do not think/or believe that any waltz in and take over syria is going to take place, but I do know this is for a fact, that these powers will be at war with one-another, thats if the U. S. will still/continue to push! /the course will run at its appointed time , this will cause the time of trouble like never before, if these issues is not resolved, \n \n even so! just don't think that it will be peace! , but instead! , all of a sudden destruction is ahead, please! , if anyone knows what I' am talking about, should comfort one another, \n \n (and YES! , I AND OTHERS AS WELL, WHICH WILL SPEAK FOR THEMSELF.

   "i just noticed something when i read this article yesterday, just want to back up a bit...\n \nThe U.S. is considering launching military strike on Syria in an attempt to kill or capture Iraqi Ba'athists, it says are behind the attacks against U.S. targets in Iraq, a senior administration official told The Jerusalem Post on Friday. \n\n is it me or isnt it strange that we would consider infiltrating syria to capture iraqis there linked to the conflict we started in iraq, but we wouldnt send a single troop into pakistan to pursue al qaeda operatives that we knew were there?\n \n \nThe official added that new U.S. sanctions are likely to be implemented. However, he said that U.S. should be more \"aggressive\" after Tuesday's attack on a U.S. base in Mosul. \n \n The officials remarks suggested that the U.S. believes the attack on the mess tent, in which 22 people were killed, was planned from inside Syrian territory. \n\n again, we state that the reason we plan to infiltrate syria is because there are iraqis there assisting the conflict in iraq. why is it that the entire country of syria must be put under sanctions because of the actions of some rogue non-syrian fighters?\n \n \n\"I think the sanctions are one thing. But I think the other thing [the Syrians] have got to start worrying about is whether we would take cross-border military action in hot pursuit or something like that. In other words, nothing like full-scale military hostilities. But when you're being attacked from safe havens across the border - we've been through this a lot of times before - we're just not going to sit there,\" the senior administration official said. \n \n \"You get a tragedy [like the attack in Mosul] and it reminds people that it is still a very serious problem. If I were Syria, I'd be worried,\" he added. \n\n and as easy as that we make syria a target. classic case of guilt by association. remember, the syrians themselves have done nothing to anger the american invasion, just some iraqis based in syria at the time. in no time at all, we see how the target transfers from iraq, to iraqis in syria, to syria. this is exactly how the war on terrorism transferred from al qaeda, to iraqi officials allegedly involved, to the alleged threat of giving (non-existent) wmds to terrorists, to invading iraq\n \n \nMeanwhile, another U.S. official said that sentiment reflects a \"growing level of frustration\" in Washington at Syria's reluctance to capture Ba'athists and other operatives, the U.S. claims are organizing attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq. \n \n However, the official cautioned that taking cross-border military action is still a matter of discussion and that a military incursion is still \"premature.\" \n \n The senior official noted that the U.S. frustration increased substantially after last month offensive in Fallujah, which revealed \"how much of the insurgency is now being directed through Syria.\" \n\n this is also similar to \"disarm or we'll attack\". providing no evidence that these \"ba'athists\" even exist, or that they are in any way linked to the syrian government, just like saddam was ordered to disarm of weapons he didnt even have, and since he didnt disarm, we had the right to attack him.\n \n not only is bush completely capable of attacking syria, but with very little effort he can have the entire populace singing his tune\n \n it still amazes me how readily america turned their rage towards iraq and away from bin laden because bush told them to. why would this be surprising now?\n \n remember, its not like hes trying to get re-elected next term",

Many substantial military expenditures are booked into budgets of agencies having little apparent association with military operations. As an example, only 50% of Homeland security costs are booked as defense costs, with the remainder expanding department of transportation spending under that budget. For the sake of debate, I'll use what's known for 2005:\n \n http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2005/index.html\n \n Current Military - $536B \n Past Military - $349B (national debt interest and veteran benefits)\n Iraq/Afghan - $50B (obviously understated with costs now at $7B/mo)\n Total - $935B\n \n CIA estimate of 2004 GDP - $10.99T, add 3% growth = $11.32T\n \n 8% of GDP for defense is extremely high for any developed nation other than Israel, where the US picks up the tab as foreign aid. \n \n Past military allocation, a result of prior military deficit spending and veteran benefits (but not including retirement, included in current costs) is not quoted as a separate number in public or official discussions of US budget issues. \n \n An important consideration when using percentages of GDP to judge military expenditures is GDP composition. 65% of a developed nation's GDP derived from consumer and public spending is considered the norm, while the US GDP is now (depending on whose numbers one uses) at 80-85%. The obvious increase is defense related due to our current foreign policy.\n \n All that aside, the only important criteria is annual operating costs (budget), annual accumulated debt as a portion of that budget and ability to service that debt. The US 2005 federal budget is $1,926T. Identified defense expenditures will be 49% of that amount, $400B of it in assumed public debt (deficit). Even though conservative estimates of 2005 deficit spending far exceed $500B on our current course. \n \n There are no easy answers. Putting 25% of annual operating costs into national debt is, as consumers have discovered on a personal basis, a loaded gun with creditors having their finger on a hair trigger. How long Japan, China and others will consider our consumer markets important enough to subsidize our government by purchasing our debt is the only real question. When one combines current low yields on our national debt to creditors with what has turned into a rout of the dollar, net yields for US government investment is a losing proposition, currently offset only by domestic profit margin taxation by those creditors. \n \n To relate this to the thread topic, intervention in Syria will make those creditors even more eager to develop other markets for their products. Who wants to extend additional credit to an entity that displays every indication of additional and ongoing financial irresponsibility? Especially with a public (US) that apparently supports government irresponsibility.",

China is also using that debt to help fund overseas resource purchases. A 100-200 billion dollar one in Iran and currently China is negotiating a more moderate deal for Alberta oil.\n \n Again as for Syria any attack would have nearly nothing to do with terrorism outside of hezbollah and hamas, it would have a negative impact on the war in Iraq as Syria would have a reduced military force in order to defend its eastern boarder, which of course would allow easier crossings for any possible Jihadist or Baathist that might be in Syria.

Money is money and collapsing the US economy would present leaving them with greatly diminished markets for their industrial production, effectively shooting themselves in the foot. Current US administration is well aware of that fact, and that China/India and others will soon raise standards of living for their populations to replace US markets. Take a brief look at world populations by country to see the potential. Right now China, Japan and other net export nations are in the unenviable position of having a concentration of market share in a customer (US) with cash flow problems. As with any sound business management, that dependency will change as they develop China, India and other former third-world nations.

   "is there really nothing that can be done to snap the public out of their psuedo-patriotic stupor. i cant even say \"short of a catastrophe\" because even that only seems to make them more entwined in their hypernationalism than ever\n\n \n Rumored or impending disasters that promote fear, as you've observed, tightens devotion to that pseudo-patriotic stupor, something the current administration is quite good at facilitating. If tomorrow the administration announced that all Syrian military installations had been leveled using 'precision' bombing because Syrian terrorists were crossing into Iraq and killing our troops, the general public would wave the flag with gusto. Without realizing Iraqi national resistance had gained a new, revenge minded ally with no border restrictions. \n \n Never underestimate the ability of politicians to manipulate the citizenry of any nation for any purpose and you'll avoid a great deal of disappointment.",

   "As someone living in one of the most over-regulated societies in Europe, I wish I could share your optimism. \n\n \n Even the most over regulated society in Europe can not come even CLOSE to the over regulated society we enjoy here in America. We have over 300 million laws and regulations on the books. That is more than any 3 nations on the planet.\n \n \nIt's true that in comparison with the dollar, the Euro is relatively \"strong\" at the moment. But you have to appreciate that among the many nations that share the European currency, quite a number are low income, \"low tech\", and poor infrastructure societies. The cost of their labour is low, so this depresses prices of manufactured goods and give an artificial competitive edge to the European average. Multi-national corporations love this for obvious reasons.\n\n \n Yes, but that is the nature of capitolism. You have to have cheap labor. What the EU effectively does is allows nations to trade on a level playing field. This is a good deal for wealthier nations becasue it allows them to exploit cheap labor without penalty. This is good for poor nations because it brings in jobs and money. Eventually (many, many years down the line) there is a good chance that the current \"rich\" nations will become \"poor\" nations nd be replaced byt he current poor nations. \n \n This is still better than what we have in the US. In the US, we need no labor because our idustrial base is gone. We are essentially a non productive entity living off our acquired wealth.\n \n \nInstead of the \"foolish decisions\" taken by independent governments, Europe has the \"benefit\" of a supra-national authority that takes them for everybody in the community. This is something that Americans would never put up with.\n At least, in theory, you can get rid of the people who have studied hard to become the XXXXXX in government: here the European Commission is several steps beyond the reach of the mere voter in the street.\n\n \n Cant argue with you here. Some of the decisions that have come out of the EU are confusing to say the least. Currently they seem to be fairly under control, since so many folks are watching them like abunch of hawks.

We like our wars to be with advesaries who are using 20 yr old weapons and conscript soldiers.\n\n \n This was one of the more interesting facets of debates regarding our invasion and occupation of Iraq.

Korea hates us, lives under a total totalitarian rule, but that's fine, they have no oil and China would rattle our cage if we did indeed invade N. Korea. Pakistan is an impoverished Muslim nation with a military general ruling under a suspended constitution where the general population considers Bin Laden a folk hero, and obviously assists in harboring Bin Laden and a net importer of oil. I won't bother with Iran, because invading Iran would make the resistance in Iraq look like a Sunday picnic.\n \n No, we attacked Iraq, at that time having the world's second largest oil reserves, on suspicion of having WMDs in its often-defeated, poorly equipped military. \n \n When that didn't pan out, the humanitarian angle of freeing the Iraqi people from a tyrannical dictator was put into play. Right next to our wonderful ally Saudi Arabia, ruled by an iron fist called the Saud Family who has eliminated the words civil rights from their language and is the world's largest sponsor of Islamic fundamentalism and consequently Islamic extremists.\n \n Now perhaps Syria, smaller than Iraq but also a net exporter of oil and possible threat to our 52nd state Israel is next in line. \n \n There has to be some wisdom in our foreign policy, followed like lemmings by the US public, but perhaps I need to devote a majority of my time to sitcoms and spectator sports to better understand or ignore that reasoning.

I won't bother with Iran, because invading Iran would make the resistance in Iraq look like a Sunday picnic.\n\n \n The Times touched on this the other day. They were talking about the deal we are likely to cut with N Korea. Apparently it is likely to include large payments made by the US to N korea and in exchange they don't produce any more nukes. Apparently the ones they already have iwll likely stay in place, but no new ones. \n \n It is amazing to me that the US public is so gullible that most of them actually bought the \"Iraq is a threat\" line. N korea has nukes pointed at out country, and Iraq was the threat? It seems that if we were really looking to eliminat threats to the US, we would have gone after N korea instead of doing a poor job of shooting untrained civilian insurgents in Iraq.\n \n The rest of the world has certainly learned their lesson from this. Egypt has accelerated their nuclear program, Iran seems hell bent on keeping their running, and a hlaf dozen other nations that we never considered a nuclear threat have announced that htey have been secretly working on their own nuclear programs.\n \n \nThere has to be some wisdom in our foreign policy, followed like lemmings by the US public, but perhaps I need to devote a majority of my time to sitcoms and spectator sports to better understand or ignore that reasoning. Logic seemingly has no place in our society or leadership.\n\n \n I'm telling you George, there is a show my secretary talks baout all the time with the other office girls. It is called \"the biggest loser\". I do not know the details, just what I have picked up wandering through the office, but apparently they vote on who is the fattest person on the show. \n \n I have heard that it is very popular with the American public.\n \n You might also try \"the apprentice\". Thats another one I have not actually watched, but it sounds like a way to kill off an hours (and maybe some of your IQ). the way it works is Donald Trump has a bunch of folks who do piddly little tasks. I think people get voted off of that show, too. \n \n This is also apparently a big hit with the American public.\n \n you should definatly check these out. \n \n Watching grown men play a childrens game (football, basketball, etc..) for millions of dollars also seems to be a really big item, as well as watching cars drive very fast in a circle (nascar).\n \n Most americans cannot recite the bill of rights, or even describe the contents, but by god they can give you a blow by blow of a patriots game that was played 2 years ago or tell you who the fattest person is on the biggest loser.",

   "therefore, the hunt for bin laden is contingent at best. if we needed a compelling reason to invade pakistan, we would find one. logical justification means diddly to this administration. its just that the war on terror isnt compelling enough\n\n \n Invading Pakistan, twice the geographical size of Iraq with six times the population and nuclear weapons, would require a direct attack on the US by Pakistan. We don't have the ground capability to invade without a general draft, which would mean pushing them into a corner with aerial devastation and inviting nuclear device retaliation. We don't pick on tough countries. \n \n The US war on terror, as has been discussed many, many times on this and most other boards, is reaction to retaliation by extremists to our foreign policy regarding Israel, the Sauds and now Iraq. The objective of our opponents is to financially drain us as we react to the thousand bites that eventually bring down a tiger. From a business person's perspective, it would be senseless for our opponents to make the war on terror compelling enough for the US to attack Pakistan when our opponents are enjoying phenomenal success with their current methodology.",

We don't have conventional capability to overpower all those nations you define with ties to what we define as terrorists. You're talking nukes. We pick on small countries we can roll over and then end up with very expensive occupational messes. Syria fits right in. Regardless of Allwai's threats, Iran doesn't. But who knows what this administration is capable of in desperation to keep us financially afloat.",

Providing an enemy, realistic or not, allows them a measure of satisfaction that their government is taking care of them and allows that government to do as it wishes while the citizenry isn't encumbered with reality.",
