The Koran claims so. Also, why do you think the Christian God exists more than, say, Allah? What makes him a more real God?\n\n \n For one, because the god called allah was a pre-islamic Moon god to the semitic people who were the descendants of Ishmaiel, the eldest son of Abraham. http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/moongod.htm So as an ancient pagan cult, the actual god of islam is the god of this world, satan himself. Which explains why islam endorses cutting the heads off of perceived infidels rather than praying for them as Jesus taught. This is why moslems pray multiple times a day to the East saying a repetitive prayer as the worshippers of the Moon god did before mohammed was even born. It is the same cult today that existed long before the modern version of islam was redefined by mohammed around 562 AD long after Jesus lived and walked among us.\n \n \nThat is assuming that you believe that God exists and that he even wants to have a relation with the Jewish people.\n\n \n God has not now nor has He ever forsaken the Jew. He has allowed them to suffer the results of rejecting Messiah whom God sent to redeem them 2000 years ago. Why ? Because, as it is written, God chastens those whom He loves. And He loves the people of Israel in spite of their rebellious nature and constant rejection of His attempts to be their God and them His people. \n \n \nBut where is your proof that Abraham was the rightful profit over Mohammed? Where do you get the Idea that any of these people even existed in the first place?\n\n \n Right here, and the link with additional info for your consideration. \n \n http://www.suite101.com/lesson.cfm/18327/1589\n \n \nWe have tangible evidence placing Abraham in these locations at the time stated. A discovery made in 1975 in the ancient city of Ebla (4), yielded 17,000 clay tablets. Ebla was a powerful city in what is now Syria, in the region between Mesopotamia and Palestine. On these tablets, a number of names are recorded, including Isaac, Jacob, and Abraham, as well as the names of Abraham's father, grandfather and great grandfather, Terah, Nahor and Serug. These names are also known from other sources in Northwest Mesopotamia in both Babylonian and Old Assyrian texts.\n\n \n \nExactly. However, all of this is only a figment of faith. What makes this figment of faith more right than the figment of faith that the angel gabriel delivered the word of God to the Prophet Mohammed\n\n \n It wasn't the Archangel Gabriel who delivered the gospel of islam to mohammed, but the fallen archangel lucifer who delivered to him his own gospel of death. And the evidence of this is the history of islam itself. It was founded on War, death, torture, and forced submission to allah under threat of death. That is a perfect description of satan, but a poor description of the God who created Man in His image for fellowship. So as usual, some common sense goes a long way in recognizing the truth from a lie.\n \n \nAnd I suppose you have God on speed dial, right?\n\n \n Well, yes, in a way. But it's better than speed dial as He actually dwells within my heart, soul and mind. He was at the forefront of my mind when I went to sleep last night, woke up this morning and right now as I type this response. I feel His presence within me and know that His thoughts are my thoughts and vice versa. He is all around you too as the bible says that where two or more are gathered in my name, there will I be. So accept Him and He will come into you and feed you His spiritual bread of life.\n \n Do you feel His presence now ? I know He is touching you as you read these words. Feel that ? That is eternal life knocking at the door of your heart and He is real, alive and the definition of Love. Say thank you Lord Jesus, because He has blessed you this day.",

You are simply making a false connection.\n \n As for repetitive prayer, are you not familiar with those Christians who take the command to \"pray continually\" literally and hence recite the prayer \"Jesus lamb of God, have mercy on me\" constantly.\n \n Linking to a website about radical wahabism is a ludicrous way of justifying your islamophobia.

He has allowed them to suffer the results of rejecting Messiah whom God sent to redeem them 2000 years ago. Why ? Because, as it is written, God chastens those whom He loves. And He loves the people of Israel in spite of their rebellious nature and constant rejection of His attempts to be their God and them His people.\n\n \n According to your bible.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt wasn't the Archangel Gabriel who delivered the gospel of islam to mohammed, but the fallen archangel lucifer who delivered to him his own gospel of death. And the evidence of this is the history of islam itself. It was founded on War, death, torture, and forced submission to allah under threat of death. That is a perfect description of satan, but a poor description of the God who created Man in His image for fellowship. So as usual, some common sense goes a long way in recognizing the truth from a lie.\n\n \n And Christianity hasn't!??!?! Are you serious?\n \n \n \n \nWell, yes, in a way. But it's better than speed dial as He actually dwells within my heart, soul and mind. He was at the forefront of my mind when I went to sleep last night, woke up this morning and right now as I type this response. I feel His presence within me and know that His thoughts are my thoughts and vice versa.\n\n \n If you think you can talk to an invisible entity, or feel another entity inside of you, you're a schizophrenic.\n \n \nHe is all around you too as the bible says that where two or more are gathered in my name, there will I be. So accept Him and He will come into you and feed you His spiritual bread of life.\n\n \n How do you know thats not Vishnu inside of you?\n \n \n \nDo you feel His presence now ? I know He is touching you as you read these words. Feel that ? That is eternal life knocking at the door of your heart and He is real, alive and the definition of Love. Say thank you Lord Jesus, because He has blessed you this day.\n\n \n I would see a psychiatrist sometime soon.",

   "None of this answers the inherent contradiction. If, as a fervent christian, I know that by abasing myself in this world I will gain glory in the next, then I know that my self-abasement will result in self-glorification - and eternal self-glorification at that. So if what my actions will end in is precisely what I am told to avoid, I must avoid it, right? But how? The only sure way would be to seek glory in this world, and thereby ensure abasement in the next. But hang on -\n \n Hell, it's your mythology. You sort it out.\n\n \n Johnhanks, your method of creating the circle of absurdity is hilarious and quite effective. But, unnecessary. \n This thread, as all religious based threads is created to make fools of religious people. Christians being the favorite target. The answer to the thread question is simply that the question is a lie. In a sense. There are of course Christians who feel pompus and better than others, just as there are atheist who feel pompus and superior because they believe they have logic'd their way to wisdom. Both are simply fooling themselves for the sake of the elation that comes from being convinced they are superior. \n The title \"Christian\" however, being derived from the name \"Christ\", should be lived, by the teachings of \"Jesus Christ\". The failure of organizations to focus totally on the teachings of Christ, and the failure of individuals to live life according to the same is not the fault of Jesus Christ the son of God. Nor is it God's fault. Christianity, a movement that is made up of millions who look toward spiritual leaders are often led astray of the teachings by agenda driven leaders who, using power vested to them by \"trust\" have tarnished the perceived goals of Christianity. Involvement in governmental or judicial affairs is an act not condoned by Christ. Judging others is not an act condoned by Christ. Loving one's neighbor as one loves oneself and being an aid to all spiritually is. Those who worked Christians who follow the leader into a frenzy and led them into \"holy wars\" in the name of God, were not Christians. They were manipulators and pharasies who lied to and used the trust placed in them by common folk. Just as occurs today in all religions.",

What affect does your upbringing and your level of exposure to other belief systems have on that experience?\n \n I guess I can understand your instant defensive posture given some of the past threads on this site, but really, you shouldn't be so paranoid about it.\n \n Waxy",

   "I dare say there are many Christians, Jews, Hindus, Moslems etc... that have never really asked themselves that question or explored the alternatives.\n\n \n I disagree, because all those Christians happen to be human. And if I'm wrong and there are \"many\" (an unquantified term), I still disagree with the idea that most have not or would not. Every Christian I have ever gotten to know enough to get into deep conversation with has, at some point had doubts, questioned their views, and \"explored the alternatives\" (in the sense that they thought about them and considered them). The reason is simple--it's part of being human. Very few people are like robots in the way they think. Most people (not just Christians and religious people) question their views on things at SOME point in their lifetimes. It's just unrealistic to think otherwise.\n \n In fact, from what I've seen, in many cases it's Christians that have questioned it more than others. One of the reasons that Christian apologetics has been a very long running movement in the faith since the time of Justin Martyr is that people in the faith do question. Christians do work through the issues too and sometimes come to different conclusions than you have.\n \n More evidence of the fact that Christian people question their beliefs is that there are so many different doctrinal factions of Christianity. One of the reasons people split off from one group is because they've questioned the beliefs of that group, and end up disagreeing. Heck, the protestant reformation wouldn't have taken place had questioning not been going on.\n \n \nIt's what they were taught, it's what they know, and they're comfortable with it.\n\n \n So? That doesn't mean they don't have doubts and question it at some point in their lives. Frankly, your view of people really, really doesn't give people (as human beings) much credit at all.

   "I disagree, because all those Christians happen to be human. And if I'm wrong and there are \"many\" (an unquantified term), I still disagree with the idea that most have not or would not. Every Christian I have ever gotten to know enough to get into deep conversation with has, at some point had doubts, questioned their views, and \"explored the alternatives\" (in the sense that they thought about them and considered them). The reason is simple--it's part of being human. Very few people are like robots in the way they think. Most people (not just Christians and religious people) question their views on things at SOME point in their lifetimes. It's just unrealistic to think otherwise.\n\n \n That's your experience. I obviously disagree. It's certainly not my experience having grown up Catholic.\n \n It's completely unrealistic to think that most Christians truly consider the validity of Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc... as alternatives to their current beliefs. \n \n I think human nature is a powerful force too, and human nature drives us to be part of the group, seek acceptance, seek answers to questions we can't answer on our own, and to stay with what gives us comfort. Our natural tendency to question is easily balanced out by these forces. \n \n This is a fascinating topic, and I'd love to find a study on it somewhere. If you asked 100 random people off the street this very question we're debating, what do you think the answers would be? What percentage of those people do you think would ever have contemplated such a question before?\n \n My gueses? The answer to the first question, if people were pressed, would almost inevitably be either an outright rejection or a religious tautology, the second question would be a very low percentage.\n \n \nIn fact, from what I've seen, in many cases it's Christians that have questioned it more than others. One of the reasons that Christian apologetics has been a very long running movement in the faith since the time of Justin Martyr is that people in the faith do question. Christians do work through the issues too and sometimes come to different conclusions than you have.\n\n \n Pondering whether or not they believe in a certain aspect of Christianity or the views of a specific sect of Christianity is a far cry from questioning one's belief in Christianity itself.\n \n \nMore evidence of the fact that Christian people question their beliefs is that there are so many different doctrinal factions of Christianity. One of the reasons people split off from one group is because they've questioned the beliefs of that group, and end up disagreeing. Heck, the protestant reformation wouldn't have taken place had questioning not been going on.\n\n \n The reformation was far more that religious and faith based.\n \n The fact there are so many sects of Christianity is not in itself proof that Christians question the core principals of Christianity and God themselves. In fact, it only goes to show that they don't question the ultimate truth of Christianity and of God as the one true almighty.\n \n \nSo? That doesn't mean they don't have doubts and question it at some point in their lives. Frankly, your view of people really, really doesn't give people (as human beings) much credit at all. Believe it or not, most people really do go through times of questioning, Waxy. I find it hard to believe you wouldn't agree with that!\n\n \n \"Having doubts and questioning\" your faith and truly exploring the options with an actual open mind are at opposite ends of the spectrum.\n \n I don't doubt that many, maybe most, Christians go through periods of doubt - when their parent dies, tragedy happens, their lives aren't going as they'd like them too, etc..., but that's a long way from those people actually going out and educating themselves or immersing themselves in other religions and truly questioning their choice. They're questioning God, but to question God, you first have to believe in him. To decide if another religion is preferrable, you first must accept and have faith in that religion.\n \n As far as giving people credit, call it cynical if you will, but I call it as I see it based on my observations.\n \n I don't agree, I don't think most people do really question. In my experience, the ones least likely to question are those that are most religious, they're on the path and have no desire to get off of it.\n \n \nSo then you DO think it's sufficient? You're actually willing to say \"oh ok, that's a good enough reason!\" ?\n\n \n Sure. Why do you find that so hard to believe? I may not agree (most likely won't), but if I can see that a person has truly examined the situation and the reasoning behind their choice, then who am I to say they're wrong?\n \n \nYes, but environment too can be religious experience (as in, brought on by God to shape our lives). If someone has a Christian upbringing, what's to say that wasn't the way God chose to bring someone into the faith?\n\n \n This is the kind of circular reasoning and \"God did it\" argument that simply can't be argued against or reasoned with.\n \n Is it God's way then to have someone be raised a Moslem extremist?\n \n Waxy",

In fact you even know a few people that didn't have a favourite food before, that now consider pizza their favourite food.\n \n That's all well and good, but it doesn't answer the question.\n \n \nI don't get that.

Because those people were questioning that very thing.\n\n \n There were many reasons for the splits, many a matter of religious interpretation, many political. Again though, regardless of the split, they all maintained the same central beliefs in God and Jesus. (ie all of their favourite food is still pizza, even though they aren't all pepperoni lovers anymore)\n \n Iv'e been very specific on that point from my first post and in my challenges to gman, it certainly wasn't sudden.

Quite frankly, it's nonsense and it's insulting. How much more plainly can I write it? \n \n The result of truly investigating with an open mind might be to remain Christian, the result might be to convert to Buddhism, the result might be to become agnostic, no one will know until they get there.\n \n By open mind I mean approaching these subjects with more than a cursory glance from the comfort of your current beliefs, but truly exploring them with the willingness to change your mind if you find reason too. I certainly don't think most Christians do this. I haven't done this myself. I certainly don't have a sufficient understanding of Islam, Hinduism, etc... to truly know whether or not I would accept them. \n \n \nI guess the question I'd have then is where do you draw the line? To what extent, specifically, do you expect them to question it?\n\n \n That's hard to say, and is somewhat a personal matter. Simply reading a flyer at your church or a few articles on the net is obviously not enough. \n \n In vague terms, I would consider sufficient the point where one has a thorough understanding of the available options, and has experienced them personally, not simply academically.\n \n \nSo? Many matters of faith are like that. That's why it's called \"faith\".\n\n \n Fair enough. If one is willing to forego reason and logic for faith, then so be it.\n \n \nMaybe. Who knows? All I know is, if people are happy and have a fulfilling life, and nobody is getting hurt, I don't see why it's reasonable they should need to question their beliefs.\n\n \n Now you're contradicting yourself.\n \n Also, people are being hurt in the example.\n \n \nHe clearly said \"I believe that Christians grew up as Christians, and never really in depth questioned their beliefs.\" We normally assume people intend to be 100% accurate unless they say otherwise. He certainly didn't indicate they were meant to only be \"generally true.\" I hope he indeed was intentionally generalizing.\n\n \n I should not have spoken for Shooterandproud.\n \n When I read the post I took it as a generalization, nothing more.

And so for most Christians it is the right religion, and they should stick with it and live it out to the full.

Then we find the beginning of God's redemptive program by the beginning of a nation.\n \n The majority of the book of Genesis has to do with God's redemptive plan by immediately narrowing down in the genealogies to one family from which family, all the nations of the world are to be blessed. Now, at various places in the book of Genesis, we will be given a listing of the genealogies of the people that were born, and the ages that they lived and all. Let me say at the outset that God did not intend to give us a complete genealogical record of all of the families of the earth.\n \n Though Adam and Eve had many sons and daughters, their first two sons were listed because they were significant. Other sons and daughters were not listed. But then there came a son when they were one hundred and thirty years old, whose name was Seth, and he was listed because it was from Seth that we are going to follow a line. Now Seth had many sons and daughters that are not listed, only one is listed because that is where the line is going to fall. And so each of them, though they had many sons and daughters, they are not part of the record because they have nothing to do with the redemptive story of God.\n \n We are coming down from Adam on a certain genealogical line to Abraham. And that's the purpose really of these genealogical studies, to show you the line from Adam on down to Abraham. But many of the sons and daughters, no record, no names, nothing, because they are not important to the story of redemption. Just those families that have to do with redemption of man are really followed. Some of them are followed just a few generations, such as Cain's, but then it's dropped because they really do not follow down into the redemptive plan of God.\n \n So inasmuch as the word Genesis means \"beginning,\" it is only appropriate that the book begins with the words \"In the beginning God.\" When was that? How long ago was that? Our minds cannot even fathom or grasp. I can understand that infinity does exist, I surely can't understand infinity. I cannot understand timelessness, eternity. I cannot comprehend space. I can understand that it just goes out there, and there is no end. I can understand that time can go back, and there is no beginning. I can understand that time will go out and there is no ending. But to really comprehend it is beyond my capacity, my limited faculties.\n \n In the beginning God (Gen 1:1)\n \n You can't go back any further than that. Now, there are certain people that would like to just eliminate the last word. They really don't want to retain God in their conscience or in their minds because their actions are opposed to what God has declared. And thus the fool has said in his heart, \"there is no God\" (Psalm 14:1) and the Bible, in Romans chapter one, speaks of them as \"professing themselves to be wise, they have become fools, changing the glory of an incorruptible God and fashioning their gods like after corruptible beasts and creeping things. And because they did not want to retain God in their minds, God gave them over to minds that were reprobate, void of God.\" (Romans 1:21-24)\n \n But if I eliminate God I've got a big problem. In the beginning, what? In the beginning, a mass of gases floating in space. Well that's not the beginning. Where did the mass of gases come from? Where did the space come from? Now it seems that ultimately every child will ask you, \"where did God come from?\" And for that we have no adequate answer. He always existed. He is self-existent. He has existed from the beginning.\n \n But when I say \"in the beginning God,\" I recognize that the whole universe is not just here by accidental compression of gasses and explosions and cooling off and the forming of planetary systems, and a particular planet with special atmospheric conditions and hydrology kind of conditions that have made it possible to support a form of life upon it.\n \n \"It just so happened\" that the earth was ninety-three million miles away from the sun. \"It just so happened\" that the atmosphere became a combination of nitrogen and oxygen in a \"just so happened\" balance of about seventy-nine percent to twenty percent with a one percent of variant gasses. \"It just so happened\" that around the earth there was a blanket of ozone. \"It just so happened\" that there was a magnetic force also that is circulating around the earth, also protecting it from the cosmic rays.\n \n And \"it just so happened\" that there is about a two-third water to one-third land mass ratio. And \"it just so happened\" that in that water there was a, somehow, a fortuitous combination of molecules of protein that happened to come together in just the right time at the right place in the right proportions under the right pressure and under the right heat and so forth, and spontaneously, these generated into a first cell. But what is the chance of that just so happening? And if you really go ahead to figure it out, you'll find that the chances are extremely rare indeed. In fact, the chances are so great that it couldn't have happened \"just so.\"\n \n Within the universe we can clearly see a design. Certainly when we get to the human body, we can see a design as we study the various aspects of the human body, the blood stream, the nervous system and all of these apparatuses that God has built in, all the checks and balances and all, they all cry out of design, the fact of design. And you cannot have design without the Designer. \"In the beginning the Designer\", \"In the beginning God\", an all-intelligent, all-wise being. And that is much easier for me to comprehend and to believe than it is for me to believe that the whole thing is just a vast series of accidental combinations, because the chance of those accidental combinations are too remote.\n \n If you really get down to it, and you want to study just the first protein molecule, you'll find that the chance factors for just the protein molecule are so great that if they are correct, and, of course, they keep making the earth older. When I was in school, I was taught the earth was two billion years old. Now the \"latest discoveries,\" and they're really not discoveries, they're just necessities that have arisen as they've realized, more and more, how complex life forms are, that they've realized that they could not have spontaneously generated in just six billion years, and so now they say the earth is ten billion years old.\n \n And so, when I went to school the earth was two billion years old, now it's ten billion years old, but I really didn't go to school that long ago. But even at ten billion years, grant them ten billion years, that isn't enough time for the proper circumstances and the proper conditions and all, to accidentally put together the first protein molecule. Even if you were putting these combinations together at the rate of a billion per second, it's impossible for me to believe.\n \n At one time I thought, \"well, maybe I am an atheist\" and then I just couldn't handle that. It was harder not to believe in God than it was to believe in God. If you try to deny the existence of God in the beginning, then you have no basis to start from, and it just leaves you totally without a foundation. \"In the beginning God\", now the Bible doesn't tell us when that was, just \"the beginning.\"\n \n In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth (Gen 1:1).\n \n The word \"created\" is the Hebrew word \"bara\" which speaks of creating something out of nothing, a capacity that only God has. Man cannot \"bara\". We cannot, out of nothing, create something. We create with the idea of \"asa,\" the Hebrew word \"asa,\" which is the assembling together of existing materials. Now the word \"asa\" is used in much of the creative acts here in the book of Genesis, the assembling of an order from pre-existing materials. But the existing materials from which the things were assembled were originally created, and how long ago, we don't know.\n \n \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\"\n \n But the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters (Gen 1:2).\n \n Now, it is inconsistent with the nature of God to create something without form and void, to create something wasted and desolate. And thus, many Bible scholars see a time gap between verses one and two of Genesis. A time gap between \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\" and the next verse which declares \"and the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.\"\n \n In Isaiah, the forty-fifth chapter, it declares that God did not create the earth without form and void, but He created it to be inhabited. Now, there are several fields of thought concerning creation, and each one of them has it's own peculiar problems. There are arguments for and against each concept:\n \n There is what is called \"Theistic Evolution.\" The acknowledging that God began everything, but then set it free to evolve. He formed the first protein molecule, but then He let it free to evolve into many forms of life. Acknowledging God in the beginning, but then it is sort of a god who is removed from His creation, because now the creation develops on its own evolutionary processes, with God's hand having been removed.\n \n There is the theory that all of this happened just about between six thousand and ten thousand years ago. And the universe, in actuality, is not any older than ten thousand years. That all of the guesstimates of man for the long period of time are just that: guesstimates of man. They are without proof, they are only theories. And that in reality, the universe is an extremely young universe, rather than an old universe as would be supposed.\n \n That the only reason why the scientists have sought to propound an old universe theory is to harmonize with the evolutionary theory, which would demand an old universe because surely all of the life forms could not have evolved in a ten thousand year period. And that the fossils, rather than having been laid down over eons of time, were actually laid down in one great cataclysm: the flood. And that the flood more accurately accounts for the fossil record than eons of time during the evolutionary processes of the world.\n \n It is interesting that, as far as we can ascertain, there is not any current fossils being embedded in the strata of the earth. That most of the mammals and leaves and everything else disintegrate and disorganize. That there are not fossils really being formed on the ocean floors. That there is that process of disintegration and encrustation on the ocean floor that takes place, but not the developing of fossils now. So if the ocean is not presently developing a column of fossils, than what were the circumstances that caused it to develop this long column of fossils in the past?\n \n Of course there are trees that grow up through several of the strata's of the fossilized forms, and how could one tree grow up through several millions of years? If you look at the fossil orders and the strata's in which they exist, it's difficult to explain how that you can have trees that grow up right through several millions of years of these fossil forms. How is it that you have the footprint of a man within the footprint of a dinosaur if the dinosaurs were extinct long before man ever inhabited the earth?\n \n There is an interesting new book called \"Earth in Upheaval\" by Emmanuel Vilikovski, which is a great treatise against uniformitarianism, which is the basis of the evolutionary theory. And he points out in this new book, \"Earth in Upheaval\", how that there is definite evidence of a great cataclysm that has taken place upon the earth, that suddenly destroyed masses of animal forms. And all kinds of bones mixed together from the various kinds of animals that do not have a natural habitat together, which are naturally enemies. But yet their bones broken and crushed, mixed together in caves in England and in other places, showing that they were thrown in there violently by force and were buried in the sand together. And that there was some great cataclysm, a testimony against uniformitarianism.\n \n Now, basically the evolutionary thesis is that all of the processes that are going on today have been going on for millions of years, so that any of the life forms can be understood by the processes today. That there has been an uniformity to the whole cycles of life, from the time that the planet first cooled sufficiently for the water bodies to be formed, and that all things are going on in a uniform way. Well, the book \"Earth in Upheaval\" is just a very powerful demonstration against that particular theory. If you destroy that theory, then you've really destroyed the evolutionary theory. And that's why so many scientists, without really good reason, cry out against Emmanuel Vilikovski's works, but more and more, his works are being tested and proved to be quite accurate indeed.\n \n There are those who say that the \"days\" of Genesis were geological eras. That the word day, \"Yom\" in the Hebrew, has a variety of meanings, which indeed is true, it is used some eleven hundred times in the Bible and it's translated fifty-one different time spans, I think, even to an indefinite period of time, \"the day of the Lord\", \"the Yom of the Lord,\" an indefinite period.\n \n So that, they say that the \"days\" of Genesis are indefinite periods of geological eras, but that of course, as I say, each of the theories presents it's difficulties; if they be indefinite periods of geological eras, the difficulty with that is that if God created the plant life upon the earth in the third geological era, and did not have the sun really shining in it's position on the earth until the fourth geological era, how did the plant life survive for a whole geological era without the sun? And if God created man in the sixth geological era and He rested in the seventh geological era, it means that Adam would have been kicked out of the garden, at the earliest, the eight geological era, and thus, was much older than the nine hundred and twelve years or whatever is ascribed to Adam's life span. So that creates problems too.\n \n Now, the idea that God created everything just about ten thousand years ago is an interesting idea and an interesting concept. Which, if you look at it, it is difficult to argue against. There are scriptures that say \"for in six days God created the heaven and the earth and everything that is in them.\" The fact that death entered with Adam's sin, then how could the fossil record testify of death before Adam's sin? Interesting arguments.\n \n One of the things that makes it impossible to challenge is that how old was Adam the first day that God created him? He was one day old. Well then how could he have a full set of teeth, a fully matured body? We don't know if he had a navel or not. But he was created with age-dating factors. In other words, if you would look at Adam the day he was created, you'd say \"why he might be thirty-five, forty years old,\" because he had certain designs that would testify to more than just a one-day old. So there were already, at his day of creation, age-dating factors.\n \n Thus, God could have created the earth and the universe with age-dating factors, with fossils already there, or with the galaxies already at a certain distance from the planet earth. So that God could have created it with age-dating factors which, if you would look at it, you'd say \"well, it's ten billion years old,\" when in reality, it was just created just a moment ago. And God is surely great enough and big enough to do it that way if He so desired. So, that makes that particular argument a very interesting argument, and a very plausible argument.\n \n One of the major difficulties that I see with it is that it doesn't really give us much opportunity for the understanding of angels and their creation. When did God then create the angels? Now when God came to Job and began to challenge Job in the thirty-eighth chapter of that book, God said to Job, \"where were you when I laid the foundations of the world?\"(Job 38:4) And God speaks in the laying of the foundations of the world: \"when the morning stars sang together\" or \"the angels singing together\" when God laid the foundations of the world. So the angels were existing when God laid the foundations of the world.\n \n So when were they created? And how is it that if they were created, the foundations of the world, one day, and then a few days later, Satan is in the garden tempting Eve. When did Satan fall? When did he rebel against God? And if he was such a new creature, and had been in heaven or been also in Eden, the garden of God, and had a dominion, an authority, a reign until the day that iniquity was found in him, and then was cast forth, when did this all take place, because Satan was there soon into the garden, to lead man astray? And how could it be that, being created so newly, could he have such influence over the other angelic beings that he could draw with him, in his rebellion, a third of the angels? So that presents a difficulty to me, to the idea that the earth just has existed for maybe six thousand to ten thousand years.\n \n The, what is known as \"gap theory\" seems to be, to me, a very plausible explanation and it is, of course, not without its problems completely. But I think the problems are not insolvable. Looking at it from the gap theory, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. How log ago? We don't know. As God created the heavens and the earth He also created the angelic beings. He created the earth to be inhabited and so there were inhabitants upon the earth. There is even the suggestion that Satan perhaps ruled over the sphere of the earth. The \"anointed cherub that covereth in the garden of God, every precious stone his covering,\" (Ezekiel 28:14) and so forth, that in reality it was here upon the earth that he had his dominion and his rulership, and that there were life forms upon the earth prior to the introduction of man, that there was plant life, and various life forms.\n \n But the earth became, and this is a possible rendering of the Hebrew in verse two rather than \"and the earth was.\" \"And the earth became wasted and desolate.\" How it became wasted and desolate; it is suggested that perhaps at Satan's rebellion, the wrath of God was poured out and the earth was sort of put in a \"deep freeze.\" Waters covered the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved over the waters. That the earth was just covered with water, frozen, and set aside for a period of time; a great \"ice age\".\n \n Now there is a lot of evidence to show that the earth has emerged from the last ice age, maybe less than ten thousand years ago, and for this I would suggest the book \"Worlds in Collision\" by Emmanuel Vilakovski. And in this particular book he points out the fact, which is interesting indeed, that there is a canyon being created by Niagara Falls. This canyon is being created at a constant rate of one foot a year. Niagara Falls coming over, a tremendous amount of water, is eroding away that shelf at the rate of one foot a year.\n \n There is a hotel on the Canadian side that a hundred years ago was built right at the edge of the falls. Now it's a hundred feet away from the falls, as the water keeps eroding away at a fairly constant one foot per year. The canyon that has been formed by Niagara Falls is seven thousand feet long. And it would stand to reason in the earlier time of the glacial regression, that the flow of water could conceivably have been much greater at that time than it is presently, and so the erosion rate could have been greater, hardly lesser. And there are other evidences that show that the earth emerged from the last ice age maybe less than seven thousand years ago. Which, of course, would be very interesting indeed as we look at the account of Genesis, which places man upon the earth in his present form just about six thousand years ago.\n \n Now, what kind of life forms may have existed upon the earth prior to the destruction, we don't know. God doesn't say. But man in his present form has existed on the earth for about six thousand years from the time of Adam. And so the adherents of the gap theory see Genesis l:l as original creation, and the rest of Genesis as a process of re-creation, as God began to re-create the earth in order to place man in his present form upon it. And thus, the days of creation in Genesis are actually re-creative days as God is now setting the earth to place man upon that earth. It is a very interesting theory indeed, a very plausible theory indeed. It would surely answer all of the problems that are raised by the scientists who are seeking to prove that the earth has been here for several million or billion years. It surely would not be out of harmony at all with what God has said here in Genesis one.",

Pastor Chuck is one of the finest Bible TEACHERS, not a preacher, in the Country today. If you listened to or read him you would actually learn what is written according to proper historical and biblical context. Here's the correlating audio message, maybe you can handle listening to it in the background as you surf.\n \n http://blueletterbible.org/audio_video/smith_chuck/Gen/5001-28.ram\n\n \n I have no problem with spiritual interpretations of the Bible, but if someone is going to talk about probabilities then they need to have an understanding of Bayes theorem, it's not much to ask. If they're going to argue with a non-theist understanding of the universe then they need to understand the philosophical and logical basis for the opposing arguments - i.e. the anthropic principle. It is not sufficient to simply ignore them. Posting more links isn't a solution to dealing with the deficiencies of your original cut and paste. Do you just post links and copies of others people's work because you don't understand the arguments?",

   "What makes Christianity a better religion than any of those religions? What makes Christianity more right? And don't say \"Because the bible says so\", because you have the Koran for Islam and the Vedas for Hinduism. There is nothing that says that the bible is any more right or wrong than any of those holy texts.\n \n So, what makes you Christians think you're more right than any of these other religions?\n\n \n This is an odd question. Everyone thinks they are right about their beliefs. If they did not they would not believe it (by definition). Also, something is objectively true. Things in contradiction cannot both be true. Therefore, something is right and everything else is wrong. It is not illogical for one group to think that theirs is the right position. The rightness or the wrongness may be debated but not that they believe it. Even you think you are right. Otherwise why post?",
