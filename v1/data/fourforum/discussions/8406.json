   "If the United States held the Israeli government to the same level of responsibility for their actions and policies as the Palestinians the United States would be closer to the position of the global community of nations. To categorize Hamas as a terrorist group you would have to categorize the Likud party and the founding fathers of Israel as terrorists. The United States government policies clearly favor the Israelis giving them a free hand to do what they want to do in the conflict. The Israelis have made more enemies than friend with their military and diplomatic government policies and actions. \n \n For the Israelis to kidnap dozens of the elected Hamas leaders of the Palestinian government is the epitome of democratic hypocrisy. The United States is Israel only supporter and friend of their current policies. Most nations of people in the free world see Israel as a terrorist's nation that receives billions of American dollars annually. Once the United States government starts treating the Israelis for who they really are there will be global unity for the State of Israel to reform her ways. The right wing Israelis have been and are the perpetrators and the aggressors in the violence in this conflict. The Palestinian people are the victims of the right wing Israelis who are fighting for the Greater State of Israel. \n \n The Israelis have had sixty years to create a Jewish State of Israel living in peace. They have failed greatly creating more wars and hatred for the Jewish people of Israel in modern times. Once the United States stands-up to the illegal actions of the Israelis, the United States will rejoin the international community once again. This would make the United States and the people of the world a whole lot safer with the exception of the Israeli hard-liners. \n \n The United States should cut all military and economic aid to Israel. The financial support of Israel from the American Jewish temple and people such as Jack Abramoff should be shut down. Only by recognizing what the Israeli right-wing government is doing, will we solve the problem in this life-long conflict. The Israeli right-wingers have undermined peace and security in the Holy Land for way too long. They have only been able to do this with the United States military and financial support.",

Immediate crippling sanctions\n 2. 30 day ultimatum to leave ALL occupied territories\n 3. If they fail to comply, put togetehr an international coalition and FORCE them back\n 4. Immediate destruction of all WMDS, missiles, or planes that have a range of more than about 30 ft. \n 5. Open borders so that ANYBODY who has been displaced by Israels real estate policies can return\n 6. Remove current government and hold OPEN and MONITORED elections.\n \n Basically, treat the isralis the way that we did Saddam when he invaded Kuwait. After all, it is pretty much the exact same thing. Treat Israel like we would any other country , and the problem will go away in short order.",

   "Palestine should capitulate to Israel? Forgive all Israeli land annexation and illegal activities? Why not just make Palestine a slave territory to Israeli labor requirements in their failed economy and admit it?\n\n I'm all for the idea of giving some of the land back to the Palestinians, but I think it is absolute lunacy to ever imagine that Israel will totally be turned back over to the Palestinians. Many of the extremist Muslim regimes (ie Iran) seem to have this grandiose notion that nothing short of the total destruction of Israel will be enough. What many Arab nations seem to forget is that they are a good bit responsible for Israel by forcing Jews to flee Arab countries following the 1949 Armistice Agreement. And correct me if I am wrong, but didn't Syria, Jordan, and Egypt also participate in land annexation?",

   "The video documentation of the Israel assault on the Palestinian society is very well documented. Many people on the so-called \"left\" are fully aware of the real reality on the ground in the Palestinian-Israeli crisis. By the time the mainstream American media reports on the Palestine-Israel crisis it has been filtered and sanitized making the Israelis the victims and the Arabs-Palestinians the terrorists. The Israeli-American Jewish right-wingers have muffled the voices of the Jewish lefties who are some of the most out spoken people against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territory. \n \n The Israeli government denies any accountability for the horrific conditions they have imposed onto the Palestinian people. The American people are financially supporting the Israeli assault on the Palestinian society. The Israelis could not get away with the murder and destruction of the Palestinian society without American's support. For many years the international community of nations has given aid to the Palestinian society. The Israeli have destroyed many of these projects. With one of the latest being the bombing of Gaza only power plant that was built with Sweden assistance. \n \n The State of Israel has refused to comply with international laws and United Nation Resolutions concerning the Palestinian-Israeli crisis. The wretched living condition that the Palestinian people are living in day-to-day are created by the policies and actions of the Israeli government are crimes against humanity. The Israeli right-wingers do not even recognize the fact that the Palestinian people ever had a homeland so there for there are no crimes. \n \n Most of the lands of the Jewish settlements that are surrounded by Green Space in many cases were the homes, farms and villages of the Palestinian people. The Israelis have destroyed more Palestinian homes and lives in their quest for the Greater State of Israel. The Israeli government continues build a wall that the Israeli right-winger call a fence on Palestinian land. As well as \"Jewish Only By-Pass Roads\" that slices and dices the West Bank into Bantam state of the Palestinian people. The United States financing of the on going process of destruction thousands of acres of Palestinian land and human lives is considered progress by the Israeli right-wingers. http://www.globalcrier.blogspot.com/",
