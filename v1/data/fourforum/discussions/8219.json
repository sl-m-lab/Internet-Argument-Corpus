   "It is rather strange for me that the leader of Georgian Republic, M. Saakashvili, was so bullish after his statement before NATO representatives during their business meeting in Paris. Maybe, he had the impression that Georgian special status of NATO partner would give Georgia an opportunity for pretending to be on the firing line in entry into the North Atlantic Community...\n I was present at this Forum in Paris and saw with my own eyes how Forum's bosses had reacted on Saakashvili's notice as if Georgia was compatible with all NATO requirements. It was hostile response. Well, all in Europe know about lapses in Saakashvili's behaviour. And I fully agree with such European countries as France, Germany and Italy that consider Georgia can not pretend to become a new member of the North Atlantic Community now, because countries of old Europe can not guarantee security for the country, which always prefer to settle any internal conflicts in way of military confrontation. It is not NATO's method to settle appeared difficulties or disagreements in relations with other world sides. Georgian entry into NATO is really profitable only for USA, known as the main sponsor of Georgian democracy. America tries to defend Saakashvili as US protege. USA is tied of supporting new Georgia on one's jack. But old Europe shouldn't join America in this case, because it doesn't fall within our interests at all.",
