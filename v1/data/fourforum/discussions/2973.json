   "For those who never saw it on the air, there is a web version of a Frontline Documentary on the US's defense policies and Gulf War I and II.\n \n It is recommended for broadband users. \n \n It is VERY impartial, in my opinion.\n \n I think this documentary sheds a lot of light on \"Defense Planning Guidance\", neo-cons, hawks, PNAC, National Security Strategy, etc. \n \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/view/\n \n Other PBS stuff:\n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/etc/wolf.html\n http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/nuclearresources.html\n http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/military/jan-june02/strikingfirst_7-01.html\n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/themes/\n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/themes/1992.html\n \n I think this is a good source of some info for debate purposes. \n I should end with a question, I suppose. \n \n Do you think that the strategy first proposed by Wolfowitz in 1992 could be considered imperialism, or is it just pragmatic, and for the overall good of the American people and the world? In other words is pre-emption merely prevention or is it a form of imperialism?",

   "Well, even though there is a huge amount of impartial info on the frontline site about the war in Iraq, I liked this video clip.\n \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/invasion/\n \n It highlights what I think was one (of many) of our miscalculations regarding the war. \n \n If Rummy & Wolfy had listened to their generals, do you think we would have had such a problem with insurgency? Would we even be talking about al-Sadr right now? Another case of 20/20 hindsight.",
