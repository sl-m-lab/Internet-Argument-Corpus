Given that it is quite widely accepted that the word 'day' may very well have been mistranslated, this might be what was meant. Of course, if you're a literalist, then that would make god a liar, so I suggest you don't be one.\n \n Don't get me wrong, I am a spiritually dead, godless, pseudo-intellectual, with no moral compass who wouldn't recognise the truth if I saw it, so what would I know?\n \n Hang on, if the above is true then I have recognised the truth. But if I have recognised the truth then the above cannot be true, so I will not have recognised the truth, and that would make the statement true.\n \n I'VE CREATED A PARADOX! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WE'RE ALL DOOMED. AAAAAAAAAAGH.\n \n Anyway, getting back to whether god is a liar or not. If god does exist and he has given us so many thing to observe, most of which would appear not to be true\n \n 1 - light from far away galaxies that would have taken far longer to get here than that age of the universe.\n 2 - records from peoples who were around at the supposed time of the 'Great Flood' that can't possibly exist because no such people would have been left alive.\n 3 - too little water to have covered the Earth anyway.\n 4 - animals that only exist in remote corners of the Earth that could not have survived a flood, but could not have been collected from said corner or returned there after said flood.\n 5 - stratified remains of progressively more advanced creatures, suggesting some kind of evolutionary element to life on Earth.\n etc etc etc.\n \n then, yes, whoever would have left all this evidence to mislead those who observed it, and would then damn those who were fooled by said evidence, would not be a nice god at all.\n \n So, whether we consider this god (he/she/it) to be a lair or not, we can at least say that such a deceiving god would not be one which I would choose to hold in high regard.\n \n Smiley",

Liberalism relies on the use of legal means over a long period of time to achieve changes within a system. Marxism advocates (or strictly speaking predicts) the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system.\n\n \n Oh really Jo? Here's a current champion of the neo-marxist left, and is most definitely a liberal. His name is Bill Moyers. And he personifies the neo-marxist liberal as this article makes very clear. And he isn't alone in his anti american ministry of subversion.\n \n http://www.michnews.com/artman/publish/article_16646.shtml\n Bill Moyers' newest Tet Offensive: An investigative analysis\n By Doug Schmitz\n MichNews.com\n May 2, 2007\n \n \n Just when you thought Bill Moyers had retired to the couch, he returns to PBS with more federally-subsidized neo-Marxist propaganda aimed at smearing President Bush and the Iraq War and the New Media. So it looks like David Brancaccio - host of Moyers' anti-U.S. septic tank, \"NOW\" - will have to share his corner of PBS's Soros-financed swamp.\n \n \"I do know that Moyers has, for years, been heavily involved with people like George Soros and the Far Left,\" said Bill O'Reilly (on the April 25, 2007 edition of \"The O'Reilly Factor\"), whom Moyers has used to gratuitously lie about Fox News and the rest of the New Media in Moyers' own brazen promotion of his anti-U.S. series. \n \n \"Yet PBS is paying him to produce documentaries that are purported to be \"objective.\" Bill Moyers is not objective, has a problem with the truth, and should no longer be receiving taxpayer money. And that is the truth,\" added O'Reilly, who said Moyers declined several invitations to appear on his show, rated number one on cable television. \n \n Like all anti-American media leftists, Moyers' self-proclaimed mandate to proselytize the Earth with the same old, tired Stalinist drivel is relentless in scathing attacks on the Bush administration, Republicans (except RINOs), our U.S. military, conservatism, capitalism and genuine, Biblical Christianity. Yet, Moyers' deleterious media malpractice always manages to slip under the mainstream media's radar, free of any ethical or moral liability - except from the real journalists of the New Media, which Moyers has grown to despise.\n \n But as commissioner of PBS's thought police, Moyers is just one of a growing number of today's Joseph Goebbels', Walter Durantys and Herbert Matthews' of the Far Left who are systematically elevating the vitriolic, anti-American rhetoric specifically designed for the political and personal destruction of the Bush administration - and the demolition of American values during a time of war, as Moyers continues to lie to his captive viewers.\n \n \"As a member of the narrow, unrepresentative elite group that has spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the last decade trying to ram leftist propaganda down the throats of unsuspecting millions, Moyers and his friends have betrayed the citizens of this country in their battle to advance an anti-capitalist, anti-American agenda so wicked that the \"citizens\" Moyers refers to would surely reject it outright if they knew the truth,\" wrote Jean Pearce of Frontpagemag.com (March 6, 2003).\n \n In effect, some of today's other kook fringe prevaricators have already been willingly echoing Moyers' blatantly subversive, anti-American sentiments: Former Los Angeles Times columnist and Gucci Marxist, Robert Scheer; MSNBC's raving lunatic and in-house Stalinist, Keith Olbermann; the long-time terrorist safe havens of CNN and the New York Times; and the Far Left's cyber- Trojan horses, Truthout.org and Salon.com. Olbermann, a Salon.com columnist, could well be Moyers' ideological mascot, with the MSNBC leftist limiting his fake news program to fellow propagandists and perennial guests like Newsweek's Richard Wolfe and Congressional Quarterly's Craig Crawford.

   "\"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. \n \n And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\"\n\n \n In response to this discussion, I read about Gap Theory. It brings to mind an ongoing question I have about analysis of Biblical Scripture that I never get answered by biblical literalists. First, regarding Gap \"Theory.\" I will admit my knowledge of the topic is limited to a Wikipedia article. \n \n But please.\n There are only 40 or so words there in Genesis 1:1-2. It is a considerable understatement to say that it is a stretch to stuff all that empiric data into that little gap. It is rather easy to dismiss those ideas as a blatant attempt to shoehorn some facts into Scripture when convenient. I think this Gap thing warrants no serious consideration. \n \n That brings up the question I referred to.\n Read those words. 40 words.\n It is rather nice poetry; it may even contain truth.\n But it clearly says nothing at all about a scientific explanation of the origin of this universe. To infer that information from those words takes a heap of interpretation. (Actually a big steaming pile of imagination.)\n \n That is what I don't understand about literalists. They don't want to be literal. The words simply don't say what they say they say, unless they say they do.\n (???)\n \n I understand poetry. Part of the beauty of poetry is its nuance and its allowance for numerous personal interpretations. If you want to interpret and discuss Scripture, fine. But it seems arrogant to insist one's personal interpretation (or more likely the preacher's) is the only one. \n \n C'mon, read those words. They mention no detail. One must make a leap to infer any detail. So that is my point. I repeatedly fail to see what the devout \"clearly\" see in Scripture. Those things you say it says are NOT obvious.\n \n This brings me to another point. Isn't a major concept of Protestantism sola scriptura? I thought that part of that idea is about not needing scriptural interpretation from anyone else. It's all there in the words. Isn't there a Martin Luther quote about a layman not needing a pope to understand scripture? (One also needs to forget that before the printing press it would have never occurred to the authors of Scripture that individuals would be reading this stuff). The point is, either it's right there in the words or it isn't. With respect to any Gap theory, it seems impossible for anyone to understand anything close to those conclusions from those two verses of Genesis.\n \n Or maybe my IQ ain't what it oughta be.",

But the nuclear winter only lasts about 100 years or so. There is biblical evidence of a pre-Adamic civilization.

That was before they concieved Cane and Abel, so, frankly, until then they would just think that sex was a \"nice tingly feeling\". The most likely way they could know is if they could communicate with other sentient beings.\n \n Also, what do you hope to accomplish by bashing Christians? You can't do anything constructive with it. Your only intent is to make others feel bad, that's all you want to do. Does putting down others make you feel good? Do you need to feed your bigoted hate by putting down those of religon?",

Because This forum alone, as a microcosm, is ample evidence of how much the World hates true believers. \n \n Jesus very clearly said Jo: \n\n Mat 24:9 \"Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.\n Mar 13:13 \"You will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.\n Luk 21:17 and you will be hated by all because of My name.\n\n \n Don't you find it interesting that the atheists and anti-christians on this forum have no problems at all with you? Doesn't that tell you ANYTHING about your spiritual walk? If the spirit of truth guiding you doesn't offend the enemies of God, then what does that say about the spirit of truth that's guiding you? It tells me there is no spirit of truth guiding you, because if it was, you would be pleased to be counted with Christ and wouldn't be standing against Him as you defend and justify the sins of the flesh that His Word condemns. \n \n And believe it or not Jo, I'm saying this to convict you of the fact that you are on the wrong side here. Not to attack or insult you. Where there is life, there is hope. And someone has to be brutally honest with you NOW to make it clear that as God doesn't compromise with evil, neither can we and still expect to be counted as His possession. And you are not only compromising with evil, you are justifying and excusing it. \n \n Stop defending what is wrong in order to be accepted by the spiritually dead. If you are truly saved then you have no place with them, and only the truth that you share with them will be a blessing to them in the end. Agreeing with sin only strengthens it and weakens the truth that it opposes. That's why the Lord said, \"you're either for me or against me, you either Love Me or Hate Me.\" \n \n This is exactly what you do when you defend the practice of homosexuality being just about two human beings loving each other. You endorse the perversion of Gods definition of the act of LOVE. You support distorting the concept of a pure life giving love for the unnatural lust of same gender sex that no matter how deep the passion goes between them will never lead to the creation of new life. And our God is the God of life, and creation, and true love, not the lusts of the flesh. Nuff said for now.",

And in order to do good to those who hate you, you must also allow them to KILL you! \n So ask yourself this Jo, if murder is one of the greatest sins one can commit, how is allowing yourself to be murdered by an enemy an act of loving him? Aren't you committing him to hell in addition to needlessly forfeiting your own life due to your twisted lack of understanding of the Word?\n\n 1) Where does the bible say \"murder is one of the greatest sins one can commit\"?\n Jesus was asked about the greatest sin, and his reply was two commandments based on LOVE.\n \n 2) Is anybody who murders \"committed to hell\"? That isn't found in the Christian theology.\n \n 3) By your logic, if somebody allows himself to be a victim of theft he is perpetrating the same type of \"problem\" that you describe.\n You falsely assume culpability in victimhood. That the victim is somehow responsible for the sin of the assailant / murderer.\n What bizarre logic you create to justify that which your religion explicitly condemns!\n \n \n \nAnd tell me this Jo, why did God create the will to fight for life under any and all circumstances into us if we are expected to just willingly lay down and allow ourselves to be killed by anyone who hates us? And before you say that isn't what you were suggesting at all, read my response to you above and see that you started this line of thinking here.\n\n One could make the same argument for homosexuality, or the desire to copulate with your neighbor's wife, or the emotion of greed...\n According to popular Christian dogma, God didn't create man to easily comply with his \"commands\", so your question is pointless.\n \n \n \nSo it isn't violence I support Jo, it's you who supports violence, and by insisting that christians should be pacifists under any circumstances as some ridiculous act of love for our enemies, you are committing us to annihilation.\n\n Archie's logic is amazing and amusing.\n War is peace.\n Freedom is slavery. \n Ignorance is strength.\n \n And if you're a pacifist, you \"support violence\"...\n \n \n \nJesus very clearly said Jo: Mat 24:9 \"Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.\n Mar 13:13 \"You will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.\n Luk 21:17 and you will be hated by all because of My name. \n\n This bait and switch gets REALLY old.\n It isn't because you're a \"Christian\" that people are annoyed with you Archie.\n It's your ARROGANCE people get annoyed with.\n It's your DISHONESTY people get annoyed with.\n \n People didn't like Hitler either.

You never fail to make my point for me. Let me explain, Man's will to survive at all cost, as I said above, is neither just an urge like LUST which is a result of our sinful nature, or just a passing desire, but is a character trait that is hard wired into us by God himself. It is neither a sin nor a bad thing, but was given us to insure that we would value and preserve life at all cost. So to compare it to one of the 7 deadly sins just confirms how twisted your understanding of Mans character makeup is in reality.\n \n \nA person being willing to die for his beliefs is an incredibly powerful message. A demonstration of faith and conviction.\n Self-sacrifice is another incredibly powerful message.\n\n \n You'll find no argument from me with this statement at all.

There isn't even a concept at that stage of the bible for people coming back from the dead.\n\n \n Poor poor foundit, your understanding is limited so you immediately assume that anything you can't comprehend must not be true. Isaacs sacrifice was a parallel of God sacrificing his own son for US. Just as Jesus rose from the dead in reality, so did Abraham believe that God would resurrect his son Isaac. Beside, Abraham was around 120 years old at the time so he wasn't looking to have any more children. Also, he loved this son and hated doing what he was doing. Read the complete account in Gen. 22 and see the parallels for yourself to Jesus, such as them walking for 3 days, and Jesus resurrecting in 3 days time.

Martin Luther King insisted that his protests be non-violent, and he was a pacifist - this is the meaning of the word.\n\n \n Sounds like he was implying that I would promote or endorse violent protests to me as he ignorantly referred to Martin Luther King as if he was representative of Jesus, His perfect Nature or that his pacifism was proof that Jesus was a pacifist too under all conditions! Jesus never would have spoken what Luke 22:36 say's if He was a pacifist.\n \n \nWe have been quoting bible passages on these issues repeatedly.\n You ignore them with little actual reference to the bible to defend your stance.\n\n \n That's a complete lie. When I support everything i say with scriptures you all attack me for preaching. You are offended and convicted by the word, so you attack me for proselytizing rather than debating issues. Then when I speak without referring to scriptures as supporting evidence, you accuse me of making it up. But as I've shown above, what I said earlier without scriptural support is true according to other published, and highly respected bible teachers.\n \n \nYour stance would be like taking your \"homosexual\" bible passages and insisting that you show us where it forbids private consensual sex in the home.\n\n \n I have done that foundit, yet you reject the evidence out of hand. Leviticus 18:22 for one, clearly say's that man on man sex is an abomination to God. He doesn't care where that sex is had. In the bedroom, a car, a travel trailer or in a motel 6, it's all an abomination to Him. So the bible is very clear that sex between 2 men in the privacy of their own bedroom is a sin. Now will you accept the bible as Gods Truth for you?\n \n \nIt is so amusing that you try to quote that passage.\n Cause later on, WHAT HAPPENS when one of the party uses the sword to try and defend Jesus?\n Jesus REBUKES the action, and states: Mat 26:52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. \n\n \n I used that verse knowing full well of 26:52 foundit. Do you really think I was unaware of Jesus healing the Centurions ear that Peter cut off at Jesus arrest in the garden? Now go study what \"if you live by the sword, you will die by the sword\" translates to mean in its fullness, in the original language, and you will find that it means if one lives by violence, then they will die by violence. I neither do that, nor do i endorse it. SELF DEFENSE isn't living by violence. \n \n And how great a liar and a hypocrite are you to argue this point when if someone broke into your home in the middle of the night, I seriously doubt that you would lay down and invite them to butcher you. And yet you would expect me to sacrifice my family rather than protect them? Dream on foundit. Jesus was a sacrificial lamb who died for my sins, but nowhere did He require that I die for the sins of murderers intent on killing me, because as a sinner that just isn't possible. So all I would be doing is throwing the life He gave me, and that of my family away, and that would be the greater sin than killing a murderer who intended to slaughter my family.\n \n \nPretty plain, isn't it.\n\n \n Only to an unbeliever with no understanding at all could your thinking be considered plain or clear.\n \n \nI think the real issue is that you love your family more than you love following the word of your god.\n You do not want to SACRIFICE as your bible commands, and instead rely on the sinful desires of the flesh to hold up your stubbornness.\n\n \n Getting slaughtered in a home invasion by criminals isn't dying for my God or His cause you schmuck. I will gladly die to glorify my Father and further the Gospel someday. But this debate hasn't been about that at all. It has been about submitting to violence, turning the other cheek to a violent attack, loving an enemy who was seeking to kill me. All perversions of what jesus intended when He gave us the Gospel to live by. But why am I not surprised that the true concepts of the bible may as well be greek for all the good it will do you based on your comprehension or discernment? \n \n \nYou are sooooo eager to be \"hated\", aren't you.\n But I don't think anybody \"hates\" you here.\n We are just tired of your lies. Tired of your arrogance. Tired of your insults. Tired of your condescension.\n And NONE of those things have ANYTHING to do with Christianity.\n The reason people get annoyed with you is NOT because of \"Christianity\", but rather because of the ANTI-Christian things that you do.\n\n \n The reason you're annoyed with me is because you HATE the truth I speak that convicts your spirits. You love the darkness and hate anyone that's bold enough to unapolagetically speak that truth. But the greatest love I can show you is to tell the truth without compromise. Someday you will realize that all of those people you embraced because they blindly accepted your sins as right and normal were your greatest enemies in this life and they walked you straight into the self destruction you're heading toward. And that those you condemned as evil and bigots were telling you the only truth that actually would have led to eternal life.\n \n \nChrist espoused humility. A trait that you know nothing of, as you are PROUD of feeling \"hated\"...\n\n \n I'm humbled that Christ has blessed me with the discernment to recognize the darkness that surrounds me when debating people like you foundit. People who will lie and say they don't hate me when the venom drips off your responses that are draped in lies and perversions of the truth of Gods Gospel that you have the nerve to even debate when you admit that you don't even believe in Him or the bible which is His Holy Word.\n \n You pervert it as you distort it with your corrupted and fleshly interpretations that are nothing more than your shallow attempts to justify your lifestyle rather than any sincere desire to actually learn Gods perspective and truth. I have no personal stake in interpreting the bible to suit my personal needs. All I care about is discerning what God intends in His Word. That's the difference between us, and is why debating with you unbelievers is pretty much a waste of my time. I find it sad that you'll never appreciate what I'm offering you until it will be too late for you to profit by my words.",

   "Firstly, something else I noticed.\n \nAttack my family with a lethal weapon and I will kill you and send you to the Lord for final judgment.\nif murder is one of the greatest sins one can commit, how is allowing yourself to be murdered by an enemy an act of loving him? Aren't you committing him to hell in addition to needlessly forfeiting your own life due to your twisted lack of understanding of the Word?\n\n Aren't you saying here that if someone attacked your family then you would willingly send yourself to Hell by killing them?\n \n Anyway... responses.\n \nJesus was messiah, so of course He was the sacrificial lamb of God who willingly died for our sins. But that in no way means that we should willingly die at the violent hands of a murderer. That is neither following any principle Jesus established for us, nor is allowing ones self to be murdered an act of love toward the killer.\n\n Doesn't the existence of recognised martyrs nullify this? Fair enough that should you randomly be attacked then you should defend yourself. But if you are attacked and defending yourself means denying your faith, which would prove the stronger - the will to live or the devotion to God?\n \n \nSure we have! Name one circumstance where Man doesn't fight to survive? Will a drowning man not fight to stay afloat? Will not a man being attacked by a bear fight it even though he knows he can't win?\nSuicide. I rest my case.\n \n \nEven Jesus prayed till He bled drops of blood that this cup of the crucifixion would pass from Him. So He didn't want to die or look forward to it at all. He just understood that His death would save humanity so His sacrifice was worthy.\n\n Nowhere did I imply that you should look forwards to becoming a martyr. Instead, I merely stated that there were some cases where the will to live is superceded by another, sometimes Godly, imperative.\n \n \nAs for Abraham, his willingness to sacrifice Isaac was a parallel of the sacrifice God would make by giving His only Son as propitiation for the sins of man. But Abraham believed God would raise Isaac from the dead if he killed him because God had already promised Abraham that a great people and Nation would come from his blood line. So he knew that Isaac wouldn't die for good.\nIf he knew Isaac wouldn't die for God, why the opening verse of Genesis 22? \"Some time later God tested Abraham.\"\n If Abraham knew for certain that Isaac would not be harmed, how does this make it a test?\n \n \nFeel free to point out where I have promoted offensive violence against anyone iangb. All I have done is rejected allowing a violent killer from murdering my family without defending them or myself. And I defy you to show me where Jesus said we should allow ourselves to be murdered in cold blood for no reason.\n\n You completely misunderstood my point here. I was merely pointing out that you were saying Jo was pro-violence, and then in the very next sentance calling her a 'pacifist'. Those two definitions don't match at all - Dr King was just an example of this.\n \n That said, there is a definite line between defensive and offensive behaviour. Defensive would be locking up and disarming an attacker. Offensive would be killing them - taking an eye for an eye, as was directly rejected by Jesus. In fact, killing an attacker would not even be taking an eye for an eye - it would be taking both eyes for their attempt at blinding you. You've overstepped your boundaries.\n \n \nYou don't get it, but the darkness hates the light, so everything I believe in is anathema to the unbelievers.\n\n I believe that we should subjugate all women. I will now use your exact argument to justify my belief - I can quote biblical references, and because it is an unpopular view it must be correct... Same goes for Fred Phelps and the Westborough Baptist Church.\n \n I still find it ironic, if you are correct, that an omnipotent God would chose to set up His religion such that only a very few souls are saved because of it.\n \n EDIT: To summarise my thinking: Jesus was undoubtedly anti-violent and a pacifist, and taught those ideals as part of Christianity. However, no (or very few, at the least) pacifists will refuse to fight back in direct self-defence and sometimes this (or at least, being prepared for this) is necessary, as shown by Archie's Biblical quote. However, there are also times when a Christian may die for his/her faith. Finally, there is a definite line between 'self-defence' and 'an eye for an eye', and Archie has crossed that line by stating that he would kill an attacker.",

   "Quoting the bible is one thing foundit, discerning its true meaning is another, and you have shown at every level of every debate, and the above post included, that you are absolutely incapable of discerning its true meaning, so I find it humorous that you're here preaching at me at all. Talk about hubris...\n Your limited understanding deceives you once again foundit. By pulling passages out of context, YOU can make the bible say anything you want it to say, and your ilk does that all the time. But the Word is complete if it is taken as a complete message, which I do. \n\n 1) The \"hubris\" in your claim to a superior understanding is repeatedly belittled by the fact that you can't understand simple English dialogue. You give yet another perfect example of that in this post, and I'll point it out in a bit.\n 2) The ol' \"out of context\" riff is really transparent when you make that claim, but then DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to show how the comment was \"out of context\".\n And we both know that you can't show anything about these bible passages that are out of context. It's just a quick and easy retort you want to make to try and neuter the meaning of the bible.\n \n \n \nThanks for proving your absolute ignorance so soon after condemning me for being spiritually ignorant foundit. You never fail to make my point for me. Let me explain, Man's will to survive at all cost, as I said above, is neither just an urge like LUST which is a result of our sinful nature, or just a passing desire, but is a character trait that is hard wired into us by God himself. It is neither a sin nor a bad thing, but was given us to insure that we would value and preserve life at all cost. So to compare it to one of the 7 deadly sins just confirms how twisted your understanding of Mans character makeup is in reality.\n\n One of the amusing shortcomings of the \"7 deadly sins\" is that IDOLATRY is not covered. Worshipping another God is obviously a significant sin, but it's not covered is it.\n Regardless, I would think the sin we are talking about falls easily under two of them. \"Wrath\" and \"Pride\".\n You are too proud to follow your own God's plan, insisting in your own temporary earth-bound existence over acknowledging his will.\n \"Wrath\" as well, as you clearly demonstrate issues towards your fellow man in defiance of the whole \"Love your enemies\" philosophy.\n \n \n \nYou'll find no argument from me with this statement at all. But are you denying the account that Jesus sweat drops of blood from the stress of knowing what He was about to suffer for mankind? Because that was the point I made which you're attacking me for, and falsely I might add.\n\n Non-sequitur. You're ignoring my point and falsely proclaiming \"attack\" just because I disagree.foundit66: A person being willing to die for his beliefs is an incredibly powerful message. A demonstration of faith and conviction.\n Self-sacrifice is another incredibly powerful message.The point being that such an action could have a bigger purpose than your arrogance in preserving your own life.\n Such is the will of your god. Who are you to question, or ignore it?\n \n \nPoor poor foundit, your understanding is limited so you immediately assume that anything you can't comprehend must not be true. \n\n There is an INCREDIBLE amount of projection going on in that statement...\n \n \nIsaacs sacrifice was ...\n\n You aren't even talking about anything which I actually said here.\n You're just trying to side-track the point I was making.\n The point being that I was giving yet another example of how you just MAKE STUFF UP when convenient. There is no precedent (and no evidence) of any \"son being raised from the dead\" at this stage in the bible. You are trying to make parallels to fairy tales which HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN CREATED yet.\n \n \n \nUh, he said this, and I quote:Originally Posted by Iangb \n Paraphrased here, but aren't those two self-contradictory? Martin Luther King insisted that his protests be non-violent, and he was a pacifist - this is the meaning of the word. Sounds like he was implying that I would promote or endorse violent protests to me as he ignorantly referred to Martin Luther King as if he was representative of Jesus, His perfect Nature or that his pacifism was proof that Jesus was a pacifist too under all conditions! Jesus never would have spoken what Luke 22:36 say's if He was a pacifist.\n\n This is what I was referring to earlier regarding your difficulties in understanding simple English, and how that belittles your pretend superiority in \"bible interpretation\".\n Here is the full context, which you ignored which SHOULD HAVE given you some clue to realize that the other person WAS NOT TALKING about YOUR VIOLENCE stance in the first place.\n Jo, it's you who supports violence, and [you insist] that christians should be pacifists under any circumstances \n\n \nParaphrased here, but aren't those two self-contradictory? Martin Luther King insisted that his protests be non-violent, and he was a pacifist - this is the meaning of the word.\nThe other person is saying YOUR CLAIM is contradictory. (And the fact that you can't see this glaring contradiction is further demonstration of your fallibility in \"interpretation\".)\n You claim, in one short sentence, that Jo's pacifist stance \"supports violence\".\n THAT is the contradiction. Nothing was ever said to allege you were \"violent\".\n \n \nThat's a complete lie.\n\n There is nothing in what I said that was a lie.\n In fact, you're about to ignore completely what I actually said....\n \n \n \nWhen I support everything i say with scriptures you all attack me for preaching. You are offended and convicted by the word, so you attack me for proselytizing rather than debating issues.\n\n Archie, try to grasp a GLARING difference in what I am about to tell you...\n \n In discussing random subjects which Christianity has presumed to comment on, like say \"homosexuality\", it is thoroughly pointless for you to quote the scripture to me when I put no stock in the scripture.\n In discussing CHRISTIAN DOGMA, it is obviously more relevant to discuss the bible. In fact, it is NECESSARY to discuss the bible.\n For you to suddenly pretend that you shouldn't quote the bible in discussing CHRISTIAN DOGMA is the height of obfuscation.\n \n Then when I speak without referring to scriptures as supporting evidence, you accuse me of making it up. But as I've shown above, what I said earlier without scriptural support is true according to other published, and highly respected bible teachers.\n \n And on another note, it's patently ridiculous to replace \"quoting bible passages on issues of universal morality\" with the \"chest pounding insistence on being right\" which you have done.\n Like you saying \"I am right and you hate truth\" is better? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nYour stance would be like taking your \"homosexual\" bible passages and insisting that you show us where it forbids private consensual sex in the home.\n\n \nI have done that foundit...\n\n You're missing the point.\n Your tactic IS FLAWED, and I was pointing out its flaw.\n As others have pointed out to you, Leviticus 18:22 specifically has a FOCUSED CONTEXT. And you want to ignore that context and proclaim it applies universally.\n But on the other hand, you want to take other quotes which have NO focused context, and insist they apply only for specific situations that aren't even mentioned in the bible.\n \n The point, which you ignored, is that you are employing PRECISELY the tactic you eschew!\n \n \n \nNow will you accept the bible as Gods Truth for you?\n\n No.\n It's a book of myths and fairy tales, filled with acts of unbelievable immorality (misogyny, genocide, slavery, ...)\n To label it as a book of morality or \"God's Truth\" is an insult to those concepts.\n And furthermore, it is arrogant for you to label it as \"gods truth\" when there are subjects within that bible which you REFUSE to discuss, like the genocide, the slavery, the misogyny, etc, etc, etc...\n \n \n \nI used that verse knowing full well of 26:52 foundit. Do you really think I was unaware of Jesus healing the Centurions ear that Peter cut off at Jesus arrest in the garden? Now go study what \"if you live by the sword, you will die by the sword\" translates to mean in its fullness, in the original language, and you will find that it means if one lives by violence, then they will die by violence. I neither do that, nor do i endorse it. SELF DEFENSE isn't living by violence. \n\n Your statement is like saying \"I only get drunk a couple times a week, and not every night\".\n You ENDORSE the violence of self-defense.\n The \"live by violence, die by violence\" mentality NEVER pretends to proclaim WHAT TYPE of violence it allows or forbids.\n It is UNILATERAL in its judgment and assessment.\n \n Peter wasn't acting out of revenge. He was trying to PROTECT ANOTHER PERSON, which is EXACTLY what you have been talking about.\n And Jesus REBUKED him for trying to protect another person.\n \n Let me repeat that so it can try to sink through your skull.\n Right before Jesus said those words, Peter was trying to PROTECT ANOTHER PERSON. An act that YOU claim is exempt from the passage.\n But that is PRECISELY the act which prompted Jesus's reply.\n You can now resume sticking your head in the sand and ignoring the content of the bible.\n \n \n \nAnd how great a liar and a hypocrite are you to argue this point ...\n\n I am neither a liar nor a hypocrite.\n I don't subscribe to the bible's teachings. I never claim to.\n I am talking about how YOU violate the bible's teachings.\n \n \n \nGetting slaughtered in a home invasion by criminals isn't dying for my God or His cause you schmuck.\n\n And I'm sure butchering your son all alone on a mountain top DOES hold some glory for God?\n It's amazing how you talk about that bible passage, yet can't comprehend how it addresses your concerns.\n \n If that \"sacrifice\" had gone forth, WHERE would the glory have been. The father would have killed the son because God said so.\n The son would have died because \"God\" had willed it.\n You seem to realize that THAT would have been an example of \"dying for God\", yet you refuse to acknowledge the same could be said for your actions with a burglar.\n \n You keep talking about how God's ways are unknowable, and how OTHERS shouldn't question them. But the truth is that you presume a LOT when it comes to those issues in defining reasons why you yourself should ignore them.\n \n \n \nThe reason you're annoyed with me is because you HATE the truth I speak that convicts your spirits. You love the darkness and hate anyone that's bold enough to unapolagetically speak that truth.\n\n Enough of your pompous chest-beating.\n I don't \"hate\" the truth.\n There is NO truth in the vile you spew.\n \n The bible has PLENTY of messages for YOU, but you refuse to listen as you use it as a weapon against others.\n Like the passage on judging people by the fruits of your labor.\n But all you do is ANNOY OTHERS.\n How do you think you should be \"judged\" in that regard?\n Oh wait! You think you are doing GOD'S WILL by annoying others, don't you.\n So you ignore the \"fruits of your labor\" passage, cause it's not convenient.\n Annoying others IS a \"fruit of your labor\" to you...",

The correct translation is the Jewish feast of Passover. The Jews did not keep Easter.\n\n \n Show me where the word easter is used in the OT in the King James version of the bible. It isn't there.

Though the badger is common in Palestine, and might occur in the wilderness, its small hide would have been useless as a tent covering. The dugong, very plentiful in the shallow waters on the shores of the Red Sea, is a marine animal from 12 to 30 feet long, something between a whale and a seal, never leaving the water, but very easily caught. It grazes on seaweed, and is known by naturalists as Halicore tabernaculi.\n \n",

But that doesn't nullify our ability to translate the greek into english. Granted that some words are trickier than others, but that's no reason to reject it as if it was changing the original message that was intended. \n \n The Greek language has four words for \"love\":\n \n 1. Ag\u00e1pe, Christian love. In Latin, it is c(h)aritas. As English has the verb \n \"cherish\" from this Latin noun, the correct noun in English would be cherishing. \n It is unselfish Christian love as taught by Christ in the Sermon on the Mount \n and is summed up by St. Paul the Apostle in 1 Corinthians 13.\n \n \n 2. Phil\u00eda or the love between friends.\n \n \n 3. Storg\u00e9 or familial love, especially between parents and their children and also with close relatives.\n \n \n 4. \u00c9ros, which has got a pagan sexual sense, a Platonic philosophical sense, and a \n Christian sense found in the Fathers. The basic meaning is attraction. It is used \n for a Christian's being pulled toward God (and the Saints). It is cultivated by\n Christians striving to understand and obey God.\n \n Here are 13 other english translations of that verse and we can see that some of them got it right.

   "I am beginning to see the roots of Ethmi's evasiveness.\n A little bit about Ethmi's \"ISR\", which is also pretty evasive...\n While The Scriptures translation is widely used among many independent Messianic and Sacred Name Movement assemblies, it has been received with a great deal of skepticism, if not criticism, from many others. This controversy often is surrounded by the fact that the ISR adheres to the opinion that the Apostolic Writings (New Testament) were originally written in Hebrew or Aramaic,[1] and fails to fully substantiate it in The Scriptures or in any other works on a book-by-book basis. It is compounded by the publisher's refusal to answer any doctrinal questions, as stated on the Institute for Scripture Research (ISR) website:The ISR will not respond to doctrinal questions.[2]Compounded with this is a lack of knowing who the ISR board of directors is, the scholastic credentials of its directors, and what their position is regarding the historical composition of the Bible. Notably lacking in The Scriptures translation or any of the ISR's research materials is any kind of position statement regarding the date of writing for any of the Biblical texts, their authorship, the location of the author, and/or the target audience of the text.\n \n It is unknown by the ISR's lack of addressing the historical composition of the Apostolic Scriptures (New Testament) what position they hold to regarding the composition of the Tanach (Old Testament). It can be assumed that the ISR does not hold to the JEDP documentary hypothesis adhered to in liberal branches of Judaism and Christianity, and probably adheres to exclusive Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. To what extent conservative and/or evangelical views of the Tanach's composition and historicity play in their views is unknown at this time.Christian Reviews\n Christian criticisms of The Scriptures have probably been more severe than Messianic criticisms, as they often accuse its publishers as trying to \"rewrite the Bible\" to fit a particular theological agenda-that of the Sacred Name Movement.[5]\n \n \n I suspect this is where Ethmi comes by the belief in Christianity, but refuses to believe hell exists.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=310967&postcount=20\n \n Controversial Passages of ISR Scriptures\n Luke 16:23\n ISR: \"And while suffering tortures in the grave, having lifted up his eyes, he saw Abraham far away, and El'azar in his bosom,\" leaving the reader with a vague impression of the location of where the rich man is being tormented, instead of leaving the text with Hades:\n \"and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom\" (RSV)\n or Sheol:\n \"In Sh'ol, where he was in torment, the rich man looked up and saw Avraham far away with El'azar at his side\" (Complete Jewish Bible).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scriptures_'98_Version",

For example, using the example from above regarding the Badger skin as compared to a seal or dolphin skin. Since the passage in question wasn't about clean or unclean animals at all, but was about what skins were used as an inner and outer covering for the tent. That message isn't lost at all in the translation, no matter which skin was proper to use. \n \n So even though you're trying to imply that the bible can't be trusted, and that is what you guys are attempting to do here. My question is, what would you have believers do? Abandon our personal relationship with God, and His word, and become Godless and faithless heathens? Look what I have found with a little bit more research? Note the bolded specifically...\n Leviticus 11:1-23 \n \"And the L-RD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them, Speak to the children of \n Israel, saying, These are the animals which you shall eat among all the animals that are \n on the earth. Whatever has a divided hoof, which is clovenfooted, and also chews the \n cud, among the animals, that you shall eat. Nevertheless these you shall not eat of those \n that chew the cud, or of those that have a divided hoof, such as the camel, because it \n chews the cud, but does not have a divided hoof So, it is unclean unto you. And the \n rabbit, because it chews the cud, but does not have a divided hoof, it is unclean to you. \n And the hare (kangaroo), because it chews the cud, but does not have a divided hoof, it is \n unclean to you. And the swine (hog, pig, pork), though it has a divided hoof, and be \n clovenfooted, yet it does not chew the cud; it is unclean to you. Of their flesh you shall \n not eat, and their carcass you shall not touch; they are unclean to you. These you shall eat \n of all that are in the waters, whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in \n the rivers, those you shall eat. And all that do not have fins and scales in the seas, and in \n the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, \n they shall be an abomination to you. They shall be even an abomination to you. You shall \n not eat of their flesh, but you shall have their carcasses in abomination. Whatever has no \n fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination to you. Now notice that it clearly says that animals of the Sea without scales are unclean and shall be an abomination to them. Correct me if I'm wrong but aren't seals and dolphins smooth skinned animals without scales? So it appears that there is a true conflict here regarding which animal is proper to use as an outer covering of the Tabernacle. \n \n Maybe iangb could post where it was some law to the OT Jews that a Honey Badger, or a Badger other than a Rock Badger couldn't be used as an outer covering of the Tabernacle. But NOWHERE above is a badger mentioned as an unclean animal TO EAT, but later on in Deuteronomy It refers only to the Rock Badger which is natural to Israel, as is the Honey Badger. I've posted pictures of both below.\n Deuteronomy 14:3-21 \n \"Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. These are the beasts which ye may eat: the ox, \n the sheep, and the goat, the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and \n the pygarg, and the antelope, and the mountain-sheep. And every beast that parteth the \n hoof, and hath the hoof wholly cloven in two, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, \n that ye may eat. Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of \n them that only have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the rock-badger, \n because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean unto you;http://www.joyofthetorah.org/DOCs/Kosher_A_Survey_of_Scripture.pdf\n \n So according to Deut. 14, it was a Rock Badger that was deemed unclean. Israel had other types of badgers that were natural to the area.\n \n Rock Badger from Israel: http://www.asergeev.com/pictures/archives/2002/265/jpeg/20.jpg\n \n Honey Badger from Israel: http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/pic/PTGPOD/OSBOA-00000311-001~Badger-with-Bucket-in-Garden-Posters.jpg\n \n And then I found this contemporary link pertaining to the Curtains and coverings of the modern Tabernacle. Wasn't I surprised to find what it say's... Notice the outer covering of badger skin, and why it's considered a practical material.\n \n http://www.hopeofisrael.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22&Itemid=31",

   "I'm no expert on honey badgers - I was not involved in that particular discussion. But if you want to discuss exact species - from Leviticus 11 again (bold added by me):\nAnd these you shall regard as an abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, the buzzard, the kite, and the falcon after its kind; every raven after its kind, the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the sea gull, and the hawk after its kind; the little owl, the fisher owl, and the screech owl; the white owl, the jackdaw, and the carrion vulture; the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat.\nIsn't this an obvious case of the bible being factually incorrect? Note that even in the hebrew translation the incorrect word is 'fowl' as opposed to 'bird'.\n This is a prime case where the bible needs to be re-interpreted to take into account that it was written a great many years ago. Those receiving Gods Word classified a bat as a 'fowl' as opposed to a 'mammal' because they believed that the bat was a bird. Is it not possible that there are other similar misconceptions?\n \n \nSo even though you're trying to imply that the bible can't be trusted, and that is what you guys are attempting to do here. My question is, what would you have believers do? Abandon our personal relationship with God, and His word, and become Godless and faithless heathens?\n\n I am implying that you should rely on the bible until it is disputed by factual observations, such as the occurrence of animals exhibiting homosexual behaviour, or stars being observed that are more than 6000 light-years away. If it is possible to interpret the bible to fit with these new-found facts, then you should do so. It's only when there is a unreconcilable conflict that you need to abandon your faith in either the bible or reality, and that hasn't really occurred yet.\n \n A relevant (if rambling) post of mine on the subject can be found here, under the subheading 'why tsukatu is wrong'. You don't have to read it, but that it's in a different topic will explain why some of what I'm about to quote may seem slightly out-of-context, so I thought I'd provide the original. Hopefully my paraphrasing will end that.\n \n \nWhat I think:\n To be a good Christian, you need to believe in God. But (and this is the important bit), God is unknowable. As such, you cannot use anything as absolute truth, because you have no guarantee that it is correct - it might just be another mysterious way in which God moves. You can use the teachings of the church and of the bible as hints on the mind of God, but never as absolute fact. And this opens up a whole other realm of possibilities, and turns Christianity into much more of a science in it's own right (albeit a science with a driving faith) - because you can use the world around you as another way of getting hints - after all, if someone made everything, you can learn about the creator by studying the creation. I don't mean looking for Jesus appearing on a slice of toast, instead you can (for example) see God introduce evolution and then beat biological evolution with social evolution - you can infer from this that if biological evolution was to produce humanity (amongst other things), social evolution must also have been to introduce 'correct' society (morals/ethics).\n ...\n You could say that the fundamental axiom of the atheist is logic, the fundamental (deeper, in a way) axiom of the theist is God. Beyond that choice of axiom, scientific reasoning works both ways.\n\n EDIT: When reality contradicts the literal fact of the bible (see my quote from Leviticus, if nothing else), you have two choices. You can argue that the Bible is utter truth and deny your own eyes, or you can adapt and realise that losses in translation and human understanding (both now and at the time of writing) mean that the bible is a window on the Mind of God, but not the whole picture.",

Here's an objective scriptural authority...\n \n Is a bat a bird?\n Leviticus 11:13-19\n (Leviticus 11:19) - \"These, moreover, you shall detest among the birds; they are abhorrent, not to be eaten: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard, 14and the kite and the falcon in its kind, 15every raven in its kind, 16 and the ostrich and the owl and the sea gull and the hawk in its kind, 17and the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl, 18and the white owl and the pelican and the carrion vulture, 19and the stork, the heron in its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat.\"\n In verse 13 Moses tells us about the birds and then he lists them out. In verse 19 we see the bat is included in this list. We know that a bat is not a bird. Does this not mean that the Bible is incorrect?\n The Bible is not meant to be a scientific description of modern biological categories. Instead, it is often written from the perspective of what we see. In other words, it makes generic categorizations. In this case, the bat is categorized as a bird because like birds, it flies and is similar in size to most birds. If we did not know that it was a mammal, it would be natural to call it a bird. To the Hebrew of ancient times, calling it a bird was perfectly logical. But, in modern times with our science of being able to categorize animal species, we know that the bat is actually a mammal and not a bird.\n Also, we must be aware that it is modern science that has a different classification system than ancient times. To the ancients, creatures such as a bat were considered birds since they categorized all flying animals as birds. If that is the category that they used, then they were correct. It is not an error. It is a difference of categorization procedures. The critic has imposed upon the ancient text a modern system of categorization and then said that the Bible is wrong. \n \n http://www.carm.org/diff/Lev_11_19.htm",

Have you ever accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, dedicated your life to Him, received the indwelling of His Holy Spirit within you as Jesus promised would happen to all who accept Him almost 2000 years ago? Have you personally experience Gods presence and personal love for you and in you for more than 30 years now, as I have? \n \n So how can you say that God is unknowable as if it's a fact? If God truly created Man for fellowship then why would He make Himself unknowable? Does that make any sense? In other words, how incredibly presumptuous of you to assume that just because you haven't met God personally, that He must be unknowable. Because I'm here to tell you that God is a personal, loving, Father to me and to every believer I know in my life. This isn't a unique experience I've had but is universally known by all Believers who have accepted Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior.",

   "First let me say that I disagree with your pessimistic and defeatist beliefs about our ability to translate and understand english versions of the original intent of the Greek or Hebrew bible. For example, using the example from above regarding the Badger skin as compared to a seal or dolphin skin. Since the passage in question wasn't about clean or unclean animals at all, but was about what skins were used as an inner and outer covering for the tent. That message isn't lost at all in the translation, no matter which skin was proper to use. \n \n So even though you're trying to imply that the bible can't be trusted, and that is what you guys are attempting to do here. My question is, what would you have believers do? Abandon our personal relationship with God, and His word, and become Godless and faithless heathens? Look what I have found with a little bit more research? Note the bolded specifically...\n \n\n \n \n \n My post was, in my opinion, neither pessimistic nor defeatist. I merely think it is impossible to accurately translate any language by merely looking up individual words in a dictionary. (Even modern day languages. Try it.) The meaning of the skins that you have derived (and I have no idea whether it is correct or not) was not obtained by word for word translation but understanding a larger overall message. \n \n Also, the conclusion one might make from this linguistic issue is not that the bible cannot be trusted, but that focusing on literal meanings of individual words is always subject to some human's translation. You have stated that you look to other scolar's interpretations at times. Nothing wrong with that. No need to abandon anything. One might merely temper one's certitude when dealing with tiny details based upon translating 2-4000 year old writings. \n \n It isn't all or nothing.

   "Poor atheists, why is it when you can no longer argue the merits of a threads discussion, you always derail it by getting personal? That's all this accusation of slander by lyte was after all, as it had no merit at all. Here is the discussion I was having with iangb, before lyteboy jumped in and went on the attack. But why would I expect anything more than that from him since he would never debate the merits of the bibles accuracy as we were discussing. \n \n And then you other atheists pipe in in order to solidify my point that as atheists, you can't debate the spiritual truths of the bible, but are totally committed to attacking a christian, no matter how weak the justification for such an attack is. Thank you all for proving that my statement to iangb that lyte accused of being slander, wasn't slander at all, but was totally accurate, and you all, as loyal and committed atheists, have confirmed that for all to see. I repost the 2 posts, with responses below as evidence that we were having a friendly debate and if one reads my complete response to iangb at the bottom of the page in proper context, it's obvious that there is nothing slanderous at all in it. \n \n But lytes cut and paste edit of my statement was intended to corrupt what I actually said and was a dishonest attempt to slander me.

I don't mean looking for Jesus appearing on a slice of toast, instead you can (for example) see God introduce evolution and then beat biological evolution with social evolution - you can infer from this that if biological evolution was to produce humanity (amongst other things), social evolution must also have been to introduce 'correct' society (morals/ethics)....\n\n \n \nRegarding the bolded, how can you say that as if it's an absolute fact iangb?

It isn't just a matter of looking at books.\n \n One of the most interesting parts of of going to bible college for me was learning about the culture and lifestyle of the people of the ancient world. When you understand how people lived, it brought the bible to life and made clear what was really meant according to the understanding of the people of the day. \n \n For example, when we say it's raining cats and dogs, we don't mean it's literally raining cats and dogs. We mean that it's raining hard. Imagine people in 2/5,000 years from now reading that statement in some current publication. Without them understanding the customs and slangs of the period, it will make no sense at all to them. \n \n All I was trying to say above is that with some passages it requires digging for the truth because of the time lapse between the writing and our current culture. And if anyone must be flexible, it is US who must understand according to the writers intent, not demand that their perspective fit our modern understanding or it is rejected as wrong.\n \n iangb's original argument was that God would never allow an unclean animal to be used on the Tabernacle, and then showed that the skins were probably seal or dolphin skins rather than badger skins. but I have since shown this from Leviticus 11, And all that do not have fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination to you. They shall be even an abomination to you. You shall not eat of their flesh, but you shall have their carcasses in abomination. Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination to you.\n \n So what we are left with is in all of the so called cases of errors and contradictions in the bible, the atheists are ripping verses out of cultural and spiritual context as they claim an error when the passage is compared with our modern culture and standards of comparison. That type of criticism is neither accurate or fair when looking at and judging ancient manuscripts. \n \n All of a sudden, the honey badger is looking better as it was shown that the rock badger, which exists in Israel was specifically named in the bible.

   "I'm going to ignore everyone, and reply to Archie. Sorry, everyone else, if I repeat what you've already said. All quotes are Archangels unless otherwise stated.\n \n \nRegarding the bolded, how can you say that as if it's an absolute fact iangb? Have you ever accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, dedicated your life to Him, received the indwelling of His Holy Spirit within you as Jesus promised would happen to all who accept Him almost 2000 years ago? Have you personally experience Gods presence and personal love for you and in you for more than 30 years now, as I have? \n\n Well, I'm only 21, so I haven't had your opportunities for '30 years of faith'. I went to a Church of England primary school, however, and believed in God until I was ~15, when I actually started thinking about it. That's probably 7 years of (knowing) faith... Then I was very anti-theistic, now I'm liberally agnostic. But I digress.\n \n \nSo how can you say that God is unknowable as if it's a fact? If God truly created Man for fellowship then why would He make Himself unknowable? Does that make any sense? In other words, how incredibly presumptuous of you to assume that just because you haven't met God personally, that He must be unknowable. Because I'm here to tell you that God is a personal, loving, Father to me and to every believer I know in my life. This isn't a unique experience I've had but is universally known by all Believers who have accepted Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior.\n\n Do you claim to fully understand God? Or if not you, do you claim that it is possible for a human being to fully understand God - an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being? I thought that God was ineffable - and if God is ineffable, then God is unknowable. \n Here I don't mean that 'you can never know anything about God', but instead that 'you can never fully understand God or His motives'. I don't think you can deny that. Given that fact, you can never know anything for absolute about God. My point stands.\n With regards to 'if God made man for company then why make himself unknowable', I could (and have) ask you the same question. If God made man for company, why isn't He more popular?\n \n \nNo, what you're saying is that because the writer of that passage didn't look 5000 years into the future and consider our cultural and scientific sensibilities into what he wrote then, then what he wrote is wrong. Nothing about imposing that demand on an ancient writing is legitimate or valid in any way.\n\n Why not? I doubt that you are arguing that the bat should be considered a bird by todays standards, so you are instead arguing that we should consider the passage in it's original context. This is exactly the same thing that I am arguing. Just as we must read 'an eye for an eye' in it's original context, or 'anyone who dishonors their father and mother should be put to death'. You just seem to have a blind spot about reading 'homosexuality is abnormal' in it's original context, which I am trying to point out is mildly hypocritical.\n \n \nLet's face it iangb, as an atheist, you aren't interested in the truth at all, but only in proving the bible wrong. It's so sad that you waste so much time focussing on all of the wrong things. But hey, we all have our ministries I guess; yours just seems to be fighting with the Creator of all that is. As long as you understand that you'll lose that fight in the end.\n\n You seem to enjoy posting things in bold to make your point, so I will do the same. \n I am an agnostic.\n I do not aim to disprove the Bible.\n Instead, I am attempting to resolve the bible with factual discrepancies that arise from misreading the verses in the incorrect context. You take 'disprove Archangels version of the bible' to mean 'disprove the bible', but how do you know that your particular version of the bible is correct? I'm still waiting on an answer to that question.\n \n Yes, you did just make a slanderous statement. You got my faith wrong, you got the intent of atheism wrong (you were describing anti-theism, incidentally), and you got my intent wrong. \n \n \nPoor atheists, why is it when you can no longer argue the merits of a threads discussion, you always derail it by getting personal?\n\n \nLet's face it iangb, as an atheist, you aren't interested in the truth at all, but only in proving the bible wrong.\n\n Sorry, isn't that you getting personal and avoiding the question?\n \n \nHere is the discussion I was having with iangb, before lyteboy jumped in and went on the attack.\n\n Actually, you've quoted me in the wrong order here. Not that it particularly matters, but it does miss out what I was actually replying to in my first point.\n \n \niangb's original argument was that God would never allow an unclean animal to be used on the Tabernacle\n\n I had nothing to do with badgers, be they honey or rock. That point was Ethmi's. I started with the importance of the various translations of the Exodus verse - be they for or against abortion (something which I am also waiting for a reply on, incidentally). I even stated earlier: \"I'm no expert on honey badgers - I was not involved in that particular discussion.\" beofre looking at the now-infamous BatBird.\n \n \nSo what we are left with is in all of the so called cases of errors and contradictions in the bible, the atheists are ripping verses out of cultural and spiritual context as they claim an error when the passage is compared with our modern culture and standards of comparison. That type of criticism is neither accurate or fair when looking at and judging ancient manuscripts.\n\n If you read any reply, read this one.\n I am not saying that the bible's inability to match up with modern standards means that it is wrong. I am saying, just as you are, that you need to read the bible with a mind to the original cultural and spiritual context. The bat is not a bird, but it used to be considered one.\n I, however, am taking this assertation to it's logical conclusion that because you do not know (for sure) the original cultural and spiritual context then you cannot know for sure about the intent of any passage within the Bible.\n I believe this is similar to what thelmoose is suggesting.\n \n How is this incorrect?\n \n EDIT: Archie posted while I was writing this. I don't have the time to address it yet, but I thought I'd clarify as he agrees with my final point(s).",

   "Let's start by responding to this: \n \n Since most atheists wouldn't know a spiritual truth if they tripped over it,\n\n \nThat assumes that \"spiritual truth\" exists at all.\n\n Thanks for admitting that I'm right by admitting that you can't even recognize that absolute spiritual truths exist.\n \n \n \nWell, I'm only 21, so I haven't had your opportunities for '30 years of faith'. I went to a Church of England primary school, however, and believed in God until I was ~15, when I actually started thinking about it. That's probably 7 years of (knowing) faith... Then I was very anti-theistic, now I'm liberally agnostic. But I digress.\n\n \n Interesting, because until I was 22 yrs old I was the religion of my birth which was moslem. I converted to Christ through a very personal and supernatural revelation which all instances of salvation are. At 21, you may think you know what's up but you're still a baby in real world time. Keep an open mind and you can still learn the truth. But you must seek it if you hope to find it. Otherwise you will squander your life away believing that you're alone when you don't have to be at all.\n \n \nDo you claim to fully understand God? Or if not you, do you claim that it is possible for a human being to fully understand God - an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being?\n\n \n Fully understand God? Of course not. It is impossible for finite Man to comprehend our infinite God FULLY. But I do know Him and I do know, and have personally experienced his direct and personal love for me as an individual. He has tickled me until I was laughing so hard my sides hurt, and when i said Father, stop I can't take anymore of this joy that is piercing my very soul, It immediately stopped and my laughter from joy turned into a warm and all encompassing love and my laughter turned into tears of absolute acceptance and unconditional love as I felt His embrace of my heart and soul. \n \n This shallow description is the best I can do with this limited language, but it doesn't come near capturing the fullness of what it feels like to be one with our heavenly Father. \n \n \nI thought that God was ineffable - and if God is ineffable, then God is unknowable.\n \n \n Then why did Messiah/Jesus come and fulfill all of the OT prophecies by living as an example for us of a victorious life, and then dying on the cross for our sins as Gods sacrificial lamb? Isn't everything Jesus represents a sign of Gods personal love for us and His desire for a personal relationship with us? I marvel at how people debate the nature of God without even understanding His nature or character.\n \n \nHere I don't mean that 'you can never know anything about God', but instead that 'you can never fully understand God or His motives'. I don't think you can deny that. Given that fact, you can never know anything for absolute about God. My point stands.\n With regards to 'if God made man for company then why make himself unknowable', I could (and have) ask you the same question. If God made man for company, why isn't He more popular?\n\n \n Your reasoning is circular and irrational on all levels iangb. I know many things absolutely about my heavenly Father, just not EVERYTHING. No human could understand the depth and breadth of Gods eternal nature and character. But what I do know about Him, I do know for absolutely sure. To say one can't know anything about God for absolutely sure is to admit that you don't really know God at all. If you knew him and had experienced His love personally, although you would never claim to know everything about him, you would surely feel confident in what you do know about Him, just as I and every other believer is. That's why we call it a personal relationship.\n \n \nWhy not? I doubt that you are arguing that the bat should be considered a bird by todays standards, so you are instead arguing that we should consider the passage in it's original context. This is exactly the same thing that I am arguing. Just as we must read 'an eye for an eye' in it's original context, or 'anyone who dishonors their father and mother should be put to death'. You just seem to have a blind spot about reading 'homosexuality is abnormal' in it's original context, which I am trying to point out is mildly hypocritical.\n\n \n First of all, who was discussing homosexuality here? We are discussing allegedly contradictory or mistaken statements in the bible. And regarding the bat; it is a small winged animal that flies like a bird, so it was categorized as a bird when flying creatures that were unclean to eat were being described. For you to call it an error rather than something that was logical for the time period is not only wrong, but inaccurate. \n \n \nYou seem to enjoy posting things in bold to make your point, so I will do the same. \n I am an agnostic.\n I do not aim to disprove the Bible.\n Instead, I am attempting to resolve the bible with factual discrepancies that arise from misreading the verses in the incorrect context.

I seek to learn what God intends in His word. After all, that is the only truth worth knowing. Everything else is just a man made lie.\n \n \nYes, you did just make a slanderous statement. You got my faith wrong, you got the intent of atheism wrong (you were describing anti-theism, incidentally), and you got my intent wrong.\n \n \n If you were truly seeking the truth about the bible iangb, you wouldn't use anti-christian sources for your ammunition with which to attack the bible.

My argument would be that just as you assume this, you can assume that the bible is literally correct until evidence appears to the contrary, whereupon you have to realise that the original source was written in a different context.\n \n \nFirst of all, who was discussing homosexuality here?

I am justified in calling it an error, but only when considering the Bible in the inappropriate context - that of todays standards. Should you look at it with standards of yore, I agree that there is no error - when I said 'factual error' in my first post, I meant to imply that the context was incorrect - as you pointed out.\n \n \nThe answer to that question is easy iangb, because I don't interpret any part of the bible according to my personal comfort zones or preferences. I seek to learn what God intends in His word. After all, that is the only truth worth knowing. Everything else is just a man made lie.\n\n That's perfectly valid, if you can show that your prior beliefs have not influenced your choice of interpretations. Going back to the homosexuality thing as an example, if every relevant instance of 'unnatural' in the bible was shown to be mistranslated or taken in the wrong context (which, incidentally, would be my argument) would you not still look to condemn homosexual behaviour?\n \n \nIf you were truly seeking the truth about the bible iangb, you wouldn't use anti-christian sources for your ammunition with which to attack the bible.

Do you think I'm so new that I don't recognize the alleged errors you have pointed out and where you come up with them?\n\n You're confusing me with other posters again. Since joining here, I have used an anti-theist site once, and apologised to you when you showed that it misquoted the bible. The rest of my sources have come from biblegateway.com and my own reading/inquiring (for example, the 'abortion' quotes I posted earlier were found because I wanted to see how correct the translation was for the quote, that I might use it in an abortion thread).\n I've even tried looking at the websites you have linked to - specialist sites that translate the bible rather than just stating it (like biblegateway does).\n \n I maintain that as an agnostic atheist, my intent is to discover the truth of the world. If I see a problem, therefore, I'm going to ask about it - be it with faith or with anything else.\n Of course, I'm going to argue my opinion, but this is through curiosity rather than malice.\n \n Finally, regarding the post you made while I was still typing my last. You have said that there are nuances of the bible that we can never know, due to our lack of knowledge and the language barrier. I (hope) I've shown that some of those nuances can have much more serious repercussions. Obviously you should believe in something until you gain information to the contrary, but it doesn't seem that this is what you are doing in all cases. Feel free to correct me, however.",

   "\n I know this is fairly cheeky (and more for the other thread), but does this statement apply to you? At what age can you say you have found 'the truth' (assuming said truth exists) - and how would you know for sure?\n\n \n By \"you\" are you asking about me personally? I found the truth on Saturday, August 16, 1975, @ 9:30 PM around a campfire, the day I got saved by receiving Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. I had absolutely no head knowledge or understanding of the bible at all. I was literally a new born babe in Christ. But if someone had held a gun to my head and said either reject Christ or I will pull this trigger, I was so sure of my salvation, I would have said, pull the trigger. And that was at 22 years old. Once Gods Holy Spirit entered me, I became a new creature in Christ and was no longer of this world but was a foreigner from that point on.\n \n \nMy reasoning is based on logic, as I haven't had the personal experience as you describe. If you know someone all your life, but they (even unintentionally) keep secrets from you, you can never know /for certain/ anything about them. The things you know may be sublimated by other motives or facets about which you know nothing.\n\n \n Your perspective is very flawed iangb. Let's take your own father as an example. Do you think he has told you every single bad thing he has ever done? Every sin he has committed? About every person he has every hurt in his life? Of course not. Just as my dad had things about his life he never shared with his children. \n \n By your reasoning, you then know nothing at all about your own father. You're implying that by not knowing something, then you in fact know nothing. That premise is ridiculous iangb. I never knew everything about my dad, but I knew him intimately as my father. I knew everything I needed to know about him to determine that although he wasn't a perfect Man, he was a loving father who cared about me and loved me the best he knew how to. And I'm sure the same applies to you and your dad even though you don't know everything about his life from his earliest experiences. But none of what you don't know prevents you from loving him and knowing that he loves you.\n \n \n So yes, it is perfectly valid to say that God loves you, unless you learn otherwise (for whatever far-flung hypothetical reason). My argument would be that just as you assume this, you can assume that the bible is literally correct until evidence appears to the contrary, whereupon you have to realise that the original source was written in a different context.\n\n \n Let me make something clear to you about our God and Creator iangb. Even those who reject, deny and attack the concept of a living and personal God, are loved by Him so much you can't even comprehend the depth of His love for you. His love isn't dependent at all on your love for Him. Just think; we are discussing a supreme being who saw our need for redemption, and has such a high standard for us, that He took human life upon Himself, became one of us, and then became the only sacrificial lamb worthy to die for our sins. And He did that so we could be reunited with Him as He originally intended before we fell from Grace in the garden. That is how deep Gods love is for us. So deep that He Himself, a perfect and Holy God would die for us Himself and take our sins upon Himself in order to redeem us. That is the Gospel of Salvation in a nutshell.\n \n \nThe homo-link was just as an example again. I am justified in calling it an error, but only when considering the Bible in the inappropriate context - that of todays standards. Should you look at it with standards of yore, I agree that there is no error - when I said 'factual error' in my first post, I meant to imply that the context was incorrect - as you pointed out.\n\n \n Prove the context in the bible that condemns homosexuality as unnatural is in error then iangb. The onus is on you to prove your point. And you would have to then prove that Gods character or value system has changed between the OT and the NT. The bible say's this, Hbr 13:8 Jesus Christ {is} the same yesterday and today and forever. So you are taking an issue of whether a bat is a mammal or a fowl and extending that so called error in categorization to a moral issue which would go against Gods unchanging character. \n \n \nThat's perfectly valid, if you can show that your prior beliefs have not influenced your choice of interpretations. Going back to the homosexuality thing as an example, if every relevant instance of 'unnatural' in the bible was shown to be mistranslated or taken in the wrong context (which, incidentally, would be my argument) would you not still look to condemn homosexual behaviour?\n\n \n That's a huge unsubstantiated \"IF\" iangb. So I suggest you jump right on it if you propose to prove that every relevant instance of the word unnatural in the bible is to be shown to be mistranslated.\n \n \nYou're confusing me with other posters again. Since joining here, I have used an anti-theist site once, and apologised to you when you showed that it misquoted the bible. The rest of my sources have come from biblegateway.com and my own reading/inquiring (for example, the 'abortion' quotes I posted earlier were found because I wanted to see how correct the translation was for the quote, that I might use it in an abortion thread).\n I've even tried looking at the websites you have linked to - specialist sites that translate the bible rather than just stating it (like biblegateway does).\n\n \n Then I apologize if I've unfairly labeled you. I'm accustomed to dealing with militant atheists around here and they are far from what one could call truth seekers.\n \n \nI maintain that as an agnostic atheist, my intent is to discover the truth of the world. If I see a problem, therefore, I'm going to ask about it - be it with faith or with anything else.\n Of course, I'm going to argue my opinion, but this is through curiosity rather than malice.\n\n \n Then do what I did and go straight to the source of life with an open heart. At 15, I laid in bed one night, not knowing in any way if a creator God even existed at all. But I knew by then that this world was made up of lies and deceit, and living in a world where even ones best friend could betray me seemed like a scary and ugly world indeed. So I reached out in the darkness of my bedroom and prayed that if God exists, to reveal Himself to me and I would follow Him. 7 years later, at 22 He finally got through to me and I received him and have had a personal relationship with Him ever since. Seleh... \n \n \nFinally, regarding the post you made while I was still typing my last. You have said that there are nuances of the bible that we can never know, due to our lack of knowledge and the language barrier. I (hope) I've shown that some of those nuances can have much more serious repercussions. Obviously you should believe in something until you gain information to the contrary, but it doesn't seem that this is what you are doing in all cases. Feel free to correct me, however.\n\n \n You haven't shown any nuances at all that prove the bible is flawed in a serious way. All you have shown is that you need to study legitimate theological sources to answer the questions you have about the bible. You must stop attempting to make the bible fit into your personal moral system and realize that our God doesn't compromise his values with us at all. The bible tells us that we either Love God or hate Him, We are for Him, or against Him. Which will you be iangb? As a free will agent, that choice will be yours and God loves you so much, He will never force you to submit to Him. It must be of our own free will.",

   "I don't think anyone is stating scripture out of context, but actually the opposite, trying to put it in the context of the original writers, a policy you have stated you support. \n \n If you concede the idea that modern sensibilties may struggle to fully understand ancient language and culture, you would have to admit that it may be difficult to account for all the nuances of modern language and culture within the constraints of ancient writings. That is, some modern concepts may not exactly translate. That does not mean there is zero correlation. Some ideas are universal and transcend the ages. It merely means a little accommodation must be made for the differences. This does not mean, either, that one need compromise any larger issues. The minutia, however, may need some subjectivity. \n \n \n It seems you have conceded that a direct literal word-for-word correlation between the ancient and the modern may not always be possible, but that is it still possible to derive larger meanings considering the contexts.\n\n \n I know you're waiting to drop a bomb of compromise on me moose, so before you do remember this. If the interpretation your seeking to update to this generation changes Gods moral standards at all, then you're going someplace I can't go. If it's homosexuality you're going after here, then that wont work because both the Old and New Testament both condemn it.\n \n But remember this moose, I have said hundreds of times that even though homosexuality is still condemned by God, just as adultery is. Both the homosexual and the adulterer are under the Grace of the Cross as any other type of sinner is. So I in no way believe homosexuals are lost or condemned in any way if they receive the same salvation and forgiveness that I and every other believer have accepted. It's a free gift so there is nothing we can do to earn salvation. All we must do is accept what jesus did as Gods perfect sacrificial lamb and we will be saved. Gay or straight, rapist or murderer. Jesus died for all of us and for every sin we can commit.\n \n But He wont compromise His values for us by accepting us in any state of sin. It is by grace that we are saved through faith in Christ and not of ourselves. The only covering for our sins that is acceptable to God is the shed blood of Jesus Christ.

Perhaps I missed it. Not that I would care if He did, but your claim has not been substantiated. You make stuff up to suit yourself.\n\n \n Note the bolded above? The verses I posted in that post you responded to with this response were salvation verses. I wasn't talking about homosexuality at all but was using verses to witness to you regarding how to be saved by grace through Jesus Christ.\n \n \nCalm down, fella. No need to get huffy.\n Still don't see where Jesus \"openly and clearly\" condemns anything. \n \n \n For that matter, not sure what hate speech you are talking about either. \n Also, not sure I know any Gomorrhites. Didn't we just get through talking about translating ancient texts? \n Lastly, YOU are the one who brought up homosexuality. I never mentioned it. Why is this on your mind so much? I think I hear an axe grinding.\n\n \n Then, when I did post passages about homosexuality being condemned in both the Old and New Testament, you come back with this: Still don't see where Jesus \"openly and clearly\" condemns anything. Show me where you even mentioned Jesus? And why must Jesus personally condemn homosexuality when He is the Word of God and therefore the author of the whole book which was inspired by His spirit? \n \n But since you want Jesus opinion, here is what He said about how God views men and women since their creation in the beginning.\n Matthew 19:3-12, \"The Pharisees also came unto Him, tempting Him, and saying unto Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away His wife for every cause? And He answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that He which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to His wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. \n This doesn't seem to leave any wiggle room at all allowing for homosexual relationships, or GAY MARRIAGE as far as that goes.",

So if you're trying to imply that being a homosexual prostitute is a sin but just being a homosexual isn't, that isn't what that passage say's at all.\n\n \n They original Greek does not have commas, and the term 'arsenokoita' had many meanings when it was originally written in the 2nd century , and homosexual was not one of them. It was most often used for those 'man/boy' relationships the Greeks had where an older man introduced a young boy to sex. It's more along the lines of pedophile, not homosexual.",

The V between Pornia and arsenokoites represents the comma that separates the two words as two distinct acts.

And nor, very clearly separates the two types of people.\n \n \nEven according to your link, which obviously is promoting a pro gay agenda Jo, the key word is arsenokoitai, and This is as accurate a translation as can be found, and a great source for translating from the original language.

Mary's genealogy is supplied in Luke 3:23-38. Dr. Henry Morris explains the genealogy in Luke:\n \n \"Joseph was clearly the son of Jacob (Matthew 1:16, so this verse [Luke 3:23 - says \"son of Heli\"] should be understood to mean \"son-in-law of Heli.\" Thus, the genealogy of Christ in Luke is actually the genealogy of Mary, while Matthew gives that of Joseph. Actually, the word \"son\" is not in the original, so it would be legitimate to supply either \"son\" or \"son-in-law\" in this context. Since Matthew and Luke clearly record much common material, it is certain that neither one could unknowingly incorporate such a flagrant apparent mistake as the wrong genealogy in his record. As it is, however, the two genealogies show that both parents were descendants of David-Joseph through Solomon (Matthew 1:7-15), thus inheriting the legal right to the throne of David, and Mary through Nathan (Luke 3:23-31), her line thus carrying the seed of David, since Solomon's line had been refused the throne because of Jechoniah's sin\" [Dr. Henry M. Morris, The Defender's Study Bible, note for Luke 3:23 (Iowa Falls, Iowa: World Publishing, Inc., 1995).].\n Now the larger, and more important question for the Jew who seeks to deny Jesus as Messiah, tell me how, TODAY, the Sanhedrin, the kneset or whatever authority upholds Jewish Law could possibly confirm the lineage of any modern Jew who came forward claiming to be Messiah, whom they admit is coming according to prophecy? It is impossible to confirm it since 2000 years of the dispersion.",

Thus, the promise is broken.\n And, He transgressed on Laws and customs handed down to His chosen people, breaking them.\n And if He can break thse rules...why not just 'fix everything magically' and let everyone back into heaven or offer forgiveness without having to sacrifice himself to himself to atone for 'sin'.\n\n \n By proving above that lineage for Jews goes through the mother and correcting that error, I have also quashed this ignorant misconception. Besides zardoz, how sexist are you to imply that women don't also have genealogies/lineages? WHAT, are they hatched or something? \n \n \nBut, if Mary was promised to Joseph (descendant of David) don't you think it would have been respectful to have approached Joseph 1st with the whole \"I'ma gonna knock up your girl for ya cause it's part of my plans.\" rather than go to Mary 1st?\n Where's the respect?\n I mean it's not like Mary had a choice either way and letting Joe in on the plan 1st would have saved Mary some problems and embarrasement...and having to get Joe all drunk and convince the simpleton that an angel is appearing before him and that Mary wasn't out fornicating or committing adultery on him but actually getting the goods from God hisself.\n\n \n Even though the Creator doesn't answer to His creation, God did inform Joseph about what was happening. Here it is:\n \n Mat 1:18 \n Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.\n Mat 1:19 \n Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.\n Mat 1:20 \n But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, \"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.\n Mat 1:21 \n \"And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.\"\n Mat 1:22 \n So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:\n Mat 1:23 \n \"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,\"[fn4] which is translated, \"God with us.\"\n Mat 1:24 \n Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,\n Mat 1:25 \n and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son.[fn5] And he called His name JESUS.\n and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. This statement means they didn't have sex until after Jesus was born. But fear not because they had other children together. Mary&#8217;s other sons included Joses (Joseph), James, Judas, and Simon. There were evidently sisters as well, but they are unnamed (Matthew 13:55-56; Mark 6:3). \n \n So I suggest you do some research before mocking what you just don't understand, or simply prefer to believe Zardoz.",

   "Again you show your ignorance of 1st century jewish tradition/mishnah. A husband and wife are betrothed to each other for a year or so before they are actually married according to the Jewish Law. That explains why Mary was still a virgin in the first place. In our culture they were referred to as married, but she was in fact promised to Joseph so they were more like engaged according to our way of thinking. \n \n And why are you completely ignoring the previous post as you always do?

   "Actually, it is the Christian who does, since they claim anybody who doesn't accept their religion goes to hell. \"Complete Jew\" is implying that those people of the jewish faith are 'incomplete' It is bigotry and an insult at the very best. I have yet to see a Jewish person say that you are going to burn in hell forever for not being Jewish.\n\n \n Many Christians do hold to the idea that both are the people of God. Unless Judaism is prepared to view Christians as the people of God (and I've never seen one that did, other than Messianic Jews), then it's the Jewish position that's typically the less inclusive in that regard. [shrug] \n \n \nAnd, Christians do not include Jewish thinking in their theology at all.\n\n \n Sure they do--they worship Yahweh and hold the OT scriptures as sacred. It's Judaism that doesn't worship Christ and doesn't hold the NT as sacred. So again, Judaism is taking the less inclusive position there. Christians accept Jewish scriptures; but Jews don't accept Christians' scripture. That's simply a fact.\n \n \nAs for intolerance, in 2003, 69% of all religious hate crimes were against Jewish people, up 4% from the year before.

They were known around the world by other names in antiquity.\n\n \n I did a search based on your comment and here is what I found.\n \n The Deep Sky Object Discovery Table lists the object discoveries in chronological order\n \n Since the earliest times, humans could view stars at night whenever it happened not to be cloudy. As in prehistoric times, there was barely no light polution in most regions of Earth, our ancestors could view stars of very faint light, and thus some of those objects we now summarize as Deep Sky Objects. This way, some of these objects are known as long as anything is known.\n \n The most remarkable such \"object\" is certainly a galaxy, our own Milky Way; however we will not count this one here. Essentially the same is true for the most remarkable \"moving\" star cluster, the Ursa Major group, which consists of most of the stars in the famous \"Big Dipper\" asterism and makes up the more conspicous part of Ursa Major. These omissions are justified first because most people nowadays don't view them as \"Deep Sky Objects\", and second because their nature, i.e. that the Milky Way is a galaxy, and that the Ursa Major stars are a physical cluster, did not become apparent before modern times.\n \n Some of the bright star clusters must also have been known very early, even before the time covered by any ancient records; these certainly include the Pleiades (M45) and the Hyades clusters in Taurus, which are conspicuous to the naked eye, and recorded early: The first certain documents on the Pleiades and Hyades are by Homer (8th century BC) in his Ilias (about 750 B.C.)and Hesiod (c. 740-670 B.C.) in his Works and Days (about 720 to 700 B.C.). The Pleiades are also mentioned in the bible, first by prophet Amos who is believed to have given his message in 750 B.C. or 749 B.C. (thus about the same time as Homer's Ilias). Second, reference is given in the Book of Job, the dating of which is disputed but may be about 1,000 B.C. (the time of Kings David and Solomon), or even earlier (the time of Moses, 13th to 16th century B.C.), or considerably later (3rd to 5th century B.C.). Less safe are possible early notions of the Andromeda Nebula (M31) found in Babylonian or Sumerian sources, and of the Orion Nebula (M42) which can be interpreted in Central American, Mayan folk tales.http://www.maa.clell.de/Messier/E/Xtra/History/deepskyd.html\n \n So according to this, Job is the earliest account, but both Homer and Amos first recorded these celestial events around the same time. There's no reason to believer Homers Iliad was an International best seller yet or had made its way to Amos's library.",
