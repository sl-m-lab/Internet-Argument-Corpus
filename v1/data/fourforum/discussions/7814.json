Kathleen Sebelius.\n \n The bill veto was overridden by a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate, ensuring that the bill will become law. The House voted 91 to 33, seven votes more than a majority, while the Senate overrode the veto on Wednesday with a vote of 30 to 10.\n\n \n \n We have always had concealed carry in kansas if you had enough money and knoew the right people. Now people other than the wealthy can carry concealed weapons!\n \n they had to over ride a veto to get it passed, but they did it!\n \n It is kind of funny becuase nobody really seemed to think that they would be able to over ride the veto. The plan seemed to be to turn this into an issue for the november elections. BUT, they did it!",

   "Gun control advocates' argument against this quote is that Jefferson was a radical. Many state legislatures passed laws against carrying concealed weapons in the 19th Century, thus recognizing the people's right to public safety as being more important than an individual right of self defense.\n\n \n Well the issue of whether Thomas Jefferson was a radical is an interesting one. I can't pretend to authoritatively answer this question, but I believe that his King and members of parliament must have found him to be a radical once they received a copy of the Jefferson-authored Continental Congress' Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking up Arms. And I think it certain that these lords and peers would have found him to be a most dangerous radical once they reviewed a copy of the Declaration of Independence he authored. Thomas Jefferson was many things: public official, historian, philosopher, plantation owner, and slaveholder. We perhaps know him best as the author who declared that all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with inalienable rights. This view of the nature of man, although it did not originate with him, was a very radical proposition to make in his time (and apparently was also too radical a view to be applied to his own slaves). \n \n The problem I have with the argument to dismiss Jefferson's views on firearm ownership on the grounds that he was a \"radical\" is that I have difficulty divorcing his philosophies and separating them into \"radical\" or \"conservative\" camps. So when I see a gun control advocate denigrate Jefferson's view of firearm ownership by dismissing him as a \"radical,\" I must wonder whether they would also dismiss his other views, like the nature of man and inalienable rights, on the same grounds. My suspicion is that they accept Jefferson's argument that all men are created equal. And like me I suspect they would embrace the \"too radical\" Jefferson and quote his theory that all men are created equal should any man in the future ever dare claim they were the product of a better man's loins and were therefore sanctioned by the doctrine of divine right to assume sovereignty over us. \n \n Now I suppose gun control advocates could justify such double think in embracing Jefferson when they agree with him and yet scorning him as \"too radical\" when he dares say things they don't like. They could easily modify the famous saying of Barry Goldwater, that \"extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,\" by adding to it \"so long as the liberty interest you want to advance is one I like, but if you advance one I despise or fear, then it is a vice.\" \n \n If this is the standard, then I am content for gun control advocates to lump me alongside Jefferson as a fellow radical. I have certainly been accused of keeping worse company in my life.\n \n One important thing I want to make sure people understand about the quote, however, is that those words were written by Cesare Beccaria (who's views also influenced the creation of the 8th. amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment). Jefferson copied the quote into one of his commonplace books. The keeping of commonplace books at that time was, well, commonplace. People like Jefferson kept \"commonplace books\" where they would write down things they had read or been exposed to which they agreed with or which they found important or which they believed were full of wisdom to govern your life by. So I want to make sure that people do not attribute this quote to Jefferson because he is not it's author. The significance of the quote is that Jefferson read it and found it to be important enough to include in his commonplace book.\n \n I do not dispute that gun control laws existed in the revolutionary era, but I don't think this can be viewed as holding public safety in higher regard than the RKBA or the right of self defense. I view such a law as balancing two important interests, but you can only view it this way if you reject the \"absolutist\" view of the RKBA. \n \n This is the main problem I see in the gun control debate today, that people get hung up over an \"absolutist\" view of the RKBA. Here is the issue in a nutshell: Many of my friends on the gun rights side of this debate see the language \"shall not be infringed\" in the amendment and argue this means no regulations/restrictions. I do not endorse this view, and I occasionally gather criticism from my gun toting friends for saying so. \n \n Now this \"absolutist\" view sends gun control supporters into a panic because they envision an individual right interpretation from SCOTUS as permitting people to run out to the mall carrying a machine gun, a flame thrower, and a rocket launcher. And because some gun control supporters are incapable of articulating why the scope of right cannot be absolute, they refuse to accept the reality that the nature of the right is individual. Instead, they engage in double think and do mental back flips over the weight of history and constitutional interpretation to argue that the right can't be individual, and instead must be a collective states right--that the phrase \"the right of the people\" should mean \"people\" in the first amendment, \"states\" in the second, and \"people\" again in the fourth. \n \n But as I said, I don't think the right can be absolute. In theory, where a man is alone on a deserted island, all rights are absolute. But in a civilized society no right is. Our statesmen and judges have always recognized this. Consider, for example, the equally unqualified language of the first amendment \"Congress shall make no law. . .abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press. . .\" and see how our legislatures and courts have always passed and upheld laws regulating libel, slander, false advertising, and speech intended to incite riots. \n \n SCOTUS has for its entire history engaged in balancing individual rights and public safety. Where fundamental rights are involved (and I argue that the RKBA is a fundamental right), the state can pass a law to infringe upon it so long as it can prove a \"compelling\" state interest to do so and also prove that the particular law in question is the \"least restrictive\" (of the right) means to accomplish that end. This is the balancing test we use when our other rights are involved, and I believe we can apply it to the individual RKBA as well. I do not ask that the RKBA be given special status above rights like the freedom of speech and press-that it be held sacred and absolutely inviolable. I merely ask that we no longer treat the RKBA like the ugly red headed step child of the family of civil liberties. I agree that she has no right to run around completely naked, and I believe the state can put some clothes on her. But I believe its time to get over the irrational fear that she will destroy our ordered society and let her out of the basement to play with the other rights. \n \n Having said this, when I see an early American law regulating concealed carry, I don't see our founders favoring public safety over firearm possession. Rather, I see them accepting that the RKBA is not absolute, and I see a balancing of two interests-the RKBA and public safety--which are not incompatible unless we force them to be by adopting the artificial \"absolutist\" view of the RKBA. I guess my question to everyone is: If our founders could strike a balance between the individual RKBA and public safety, then why can't we?",

So when I see a gun control advocate denigrate Jefferson's view of firearm ownership by dismissing him as a \"radical,\" I must wonder whether they would also dismiss his other views, like the nature of man and inalienable rights, on the same grounds. My suspicion is that they accept Jefferson's argument that all men are created equal. And like me I suspect they would embrace the \"too radical\" Jefferson and quote his theory that all men are created equal should any man in the future ever dare claim they were the product of a better man's loins and were therefore sanctioned by the doctrine of divine right to assume sovereignty over us. \n \n Now I suppose gun control advocates could justify such double think in embracing Jefferson when they agree with him and yet scorning him as \"too radical\" when he dares say things they don't like. They could easily modify the famous saying of Barry Goldwater, that \"extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,\" by adding to it \"so long as the liberty interest you want to advance is one I like, but if you advance one I despise or fear, then it is a vice.\" \n \n If this is the standard, then I am content for gun control advocates to lump me alongside Jefferson as a fellow radical. I have certainly been accused of keeping worse company in my life.\n \n One important thing I want to make sure people understand about the quote, however, is that those words were written by Cesare Beccaria (who's views also influenced the creation of the 8th. amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment). Jefferson copied the quote into one of his commonplace books. The keeping of commonplace books at that time was, well, commonplace. People like Jefferson kept \"commonplace books\" where they would write down things they had read or been exposed to which they agreed with or which they found important or which they believed were full of wisdom to govern your life by. So I want to make sure that people do not attribute this quote to Jefferson because he is not it's author. The significance of the quote is that Jefferson read it and found it to be important enough to include in his commonplace book.\n\n I think that Jefferson certainly played an important part in American Independence. But he also had some radical views about certain issues. He was a good deal more libertarian than most of his contemporaries, who often viewed anarchy as dangerous as tyranny. Historian Saul Cornell comments,\n \"Indeed, none of the arms-bearing provisions adopted by state constitutions in the Founding era followed Beccaria's or Jefferson's model. Both Beccaria and Jefferson's more individualistic conception of the right to have arms for self-defense clearly stood outside of the constitutional mainstream in the eighteenth century.\"\n http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/22.1/comment_cornell.html\n \n \n\n I do not dispute that gun control laws existed in the revolutionary era, but I don't think this can be viewed as holding public safety in higher regard than the RKBA or the right of self defense. I view such a law as balancing two important interests, but you can only view it this way if you reject the \"absolutist\" view of the RKBA. \n \n This is the main problem I see in the gun control debate today, that people get hung up over an \"absolutist\" view of the RKBA. Here is the issue in a nutshell: Many of my friends on the gun rights side of this debate see the language \"shall not be infringed\" in the amendment and argue this means no regulations/restrictions. I do not endorse this view, and I occasionally gather criticism from my gun toting friends for saying so. \n \n Now this \"absolutist\" view sends gun control supporters into a panic because they envision an individual right interpretation from SCOTUS as permitting people to run out to the mall carrying a machine gun, a flame thrower, and a rocket launcher. And because some gun control supporters are incapable of articulating why the scope of right cannot be absolute, they refuse to accept the reality that the nature of the right is individual. Instead, they engage in double think and do mental back flips over the weight of history and constitutional interpretation to argue that the right can't be individual, and instead must be a collective states right--that the phrase \"the right of the people\" should mean \"people\" in the first amendment, \"states\" in the second, and \"people\" again in the fourth.\n\n I think the States Rights' interpretation originated in the latter part of the 19th Century as an argument against the right to bear arms being incorporated by the 14th Amendment. Advocates argued that the right to bear arms was a right of the state rather than a privilege and immunity of national citizenship. \n \n \n\n But as I said, I don't think the right can be absolute. In theory, where a man is alone on a deserted island, all rights are absolute. But in a civilized society no right is. Our statesmen and judges have always recognized this. Consider, for example, the equally unqualified language of the first amendment \"Congress shall make no law. . .abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press. . .\" and see how our legislatures and courts have always passed and upheld laws regulating libel, slander, false advertising, and speech intended to incite riots. \n \n SCOTUS has for its entire history engaged in balancing individual rights and public safety. Where fundamental rights are involved (and I argue that the RKBA is a fundamental right), the state can pass a law to infringe upon it so long as it can prove a \"compelling\" state interest to do so and also prove that the particular law in question is the \"least restrictive\" (of the right) means to accomplish that end. This is the balancing test we use when our other rights are involved, and I believe we can apply it to the individual RKBA as well. I do not ask that the RKBA be given special status above rights like the freedom of speech and press-that it be held sacred and absolutely inviolable. I merely ask that we no longer treat the RKBA like the ugly red headed step child of the family of civil liberties. I agree that she has no right to run around completely naked, and I believe the state can put some clothes on her. But I believe its time to get over the irrational fear that she will destroy our ordered society and let her out of the basement to play with the other rights. \n \n Having said this, when I see an early American law regulating concealed carry, I don't see our founders favoring public safety over firearm possession. Rather, I see them accepting that the RKBA is not absolute, and I see a balancing of two interests-the RKBA and public safety--which are not incompatible unless we force them to be by adopting the artificial \"absolutist\" view of the RKBA. I guess my question to everyone is: If our founders could strike a balance between the individual RKBA and public safety, then why can't we?\n\n Because organizations like the NRA are afraid that gun control is a slippery slope and will lead to a total ban on all weapons. However, such an attitude makes them look like extremists and increases opposition against them. \"Gun nut\" is a term used to label extremists on the pro-gun side of the debate. There is no equivalent term in common use that is used to label extremists on the other side of the debate which I think tells us something about public opinion. I think the courts are a long way from recognizing the RKBA as an individual right with the same status as free speech. Even in the Emerson case although the court recognized the Second Amendment as protecting an individual right they didn't apply strict scrutiny (something that would be required if they were dealing with a fundamental right).",

   "Well, I read the piece you cited from Saul Cornell. When he speaks of \"Beccaria's or Jefferson's model,\" he does not really explain what that model is. It is clear to me however, that he uses this term to describe the broad individual right view, where the right is construed to extend beyond merely that of civic collective militia defense and includes private self defense. I do take issue with is claim that \"none of the arms-bearing provisions adopted by state constitutions in the Founding era followed Beccaria's or Jefferson's model.\" The Constitution of Pennsylvania, as adopted August 16, 1776, stated the right thus:\n \n \"That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state; And as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\"\n \n In this article I see that Cornell decries the emphasis he sees individual right supporters place on Beccaria. He makes a broad assertion that \"Both Beccaria and Jefferson's more individualistic conception of the right to have arms for self-defense clearly stood outside of the constitutional mainstream in the eighteenth century.\" He does not, however, provide evidence for this assertion in his article. \n \n Instead, he urges us to look at what he says is an \"important but largely forgotten context of the Second Amendment,\" namely, the English (Scottish) republican writer James Burgh, to solve the individual/collective right question: \n \n \"The key to understanding this lost context of the Second Amendment resides in the writings of thinkers such as James Burgh, who distilled the history of Scotland into a potent tonic for the Founders, reminding them of the dangers of allowing the militia to be disarmed by a distant and powerful government.\"\n \n I agree we should look at Burgh. I don't know what recent individual right scholarship Cornell claims to have read which he says neglects this writer, but Burgh is well known to individual right's scholars. I have encountered his writing several times reading articles written by individual right scholars. \n \n Cornell does not quote Burgh in his article to support the inference that Burgh viewed the RKBA as not including individual self defense. Additionally, I have not had the opportunity to read the article from Mr. Konig which Cornell cites to see what, if anything, it has offered us from Burgh. If anyone knows where I can find it on the web, then please post a link so I can read it. In any event this is what I know Burgh to have said regarding the militia:\n \n \"Nothing will make a nation so unconquerable as a militia, or every man's being trained to arms. . . . And if the generality of housekeepers were only half disciplined, a designing prince, or ministry, would hardly dare to provoke the people by an open attack on their liberties. . . .But without the people's having some knowledge of arms, I see not what is to secure them against slavery. . . .The confidence, which a standing army gives a minister, puts him upon carrying things with a higher hand, than he would attempt to do, if the people were armed, and the court unarmed, that is, if there were no land-force in the nation, but a militia. Had we [England] at this time no standing army, we should not think of forcing money out of the pockets of three millions of our subjects. .[I take the liberty to omit a long list of injustices suffered by the colonists cited by Burgh here] . .There is no end to observations on the difference between the measures likely to be pursued by a minister backed by a standing army, and those of a court awed by the fear of an armed people.\" James Burgh, 2 Political Disquisitions, pp. 475-76. (London 1774).\n \n This could well be what Cornell (and perhaps Konig?) says supports a claim that Burgh was a collective militia right and not an individual right supporter. \n \n I do not dispute Cornell's claim that Burgh's influence on our founders was considerable. I am aware that this cited work, speaking in 1774 of observations Burgh says are of \"our brave American children,\" was clearly sympathetic to our founder's struggle. I am aware from reading individual right literature of a claim that popular demand for his work led to the printing of an edition in America, and that Benjamin Franklin served as the editor. The same article says that the subscription list for this edition included George Washington, John Adams, John Hancock, and John Dickenson. David T Hardy, Armed Citizens, Citizen Armies: Toward a Jurisprudence of the Second Amendment, 9 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 587 (1986).\n \n What I feel Cornell is unlikely to cite, however (and Konig as well if he also argues against an individual right including a right of private self defense), is what Burgh says in this \"important\" work on page 390:\n \n \"No kingdom can be secured otherwise than by arming the people. The possession of arms is the distinction between a freedman and a slave, he, who has nothing, and who himself belongs to another, must be defended by him, whose property he is, and needs no arms. But he who thinks he is his own master, and has what he can call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself, and what he possesses, else he lives precariously, and at discretion.\" James Burgh, 2 Political Disquisitions, p. 390 (London 1774).\n \n I also know from reading individual right's scholarship that this line of though did not originate with Burgh. He is merely quoting with approval what an earlier English republican writer, Andrew Fletcher, said in a work published in 1749:\n \n \"And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Our ancestors, by being always armed, and frequently in action, defended themselves against the Romans, Danes, and English; and maintained their liberty against encroachments of their own princes.\" Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).\n \n I also believe that what you see here is the influence of Aristotle's thought on the matter of the RKBA: \"For those who can possess and wield arms are in a position to decide whether the constitution is to continue or not.\" Aristotle, Athenian Constitution.\n \n So in essence I agree that Burgh was an important source for our founder's theory on the RKBA. I disagree with the suggestion that individual right's scholars have neglected him, and I most certainly disagree with any suggestion that he can be read as not supporting a RKBA to defend oneself and \"anything he may call his own.\" \n \n On the Origin of the Collective Right Theory:\n \n I believe that the \"collective right\" opinion was never expressed until after Miller. Stephen Halbrook has researched the issue, and found that the first time the collective right theory is ever mentioned was in a federal circuit court or appeals case in 1943. I have been through every SCOTUS case that cites the Second Amendment or the RKBA, and there is no case in the 19th. Century which mentions or can be construed as supporting the collective right interpretation. There simply was no dispute that the right was individual. There was a fear, however, of what this implied for slaves. In the infamous case of Dred Scott v. Sanford, for example, citizenship was denied the black slave plaintiff precisely because it was inconceivable that the rights of citizenship (including a right to keep and bear private arms) would apply to him in the southern slaveholding states. See here what rights the court said would apply if the black man were free and considered a citizen:\n \n \"It would give to persons of the Negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of the law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak, to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and bear arms wherever they went.\" Dred Scott v. Sanford , 60 U.S. 393. (1856)\n \n Cornell does make a passing reference to the slavery question in the article. He avoids, however, the history of emancipation, de facto slavery, and the 14th. Amendment. I have addressed this history elsewhere, and I still assert that it shows the RKBA was universally believed to be individual. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=99798#post99798\n \n \"Gun Nuts\" \n \n Now are there \"extremists\" on the gun right's side of the debate? I believe so, and have said so many times before. I think what I have termed the \"absolutist\" \"arms include everything and no restrictions of any kind ever\" position is extremist. I fail to see the logic behind a claim that suggests I have an unrestricted right to fly a plane and practice carpet bombing, or to own a rocket battery containing sarin gas. \n \n But to be fair there are extremists in the gun ban crowd as well. People like Rosie O'Donnell, for example: \"I honestly think - and I am not an expert on the amendments - I think the only people in this nation who should be allowed to own guns are police officers. I don't care if you want to hunt, I don't care if you think it's your right. I say 'sorry'. It is 1999, we have had enough as a nation. You are not allowed to own a gun and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison.\" The Rosie O'Donnell Show, April 21, 1999\n \n I think branding me a criminal and putting me in prison as an innocent owner of private property, merely because someone else made an ill use of their property, is extreme. The theory which holds that I should be forced to suffer, not for any wrongdoing of my own, but because of the misdeeds of others, is absurd. And I know Rosie is not the only person whose zeal takes them down this path.\n \n \"Gun nut\" is the term the media has indiscriminately applied to individual right supporters. But this kind of stereotyping is typical of a media culture that is almost universally hostile to the standard model interpretation of the Second Amendment, and is just one more example of the bias it exhibits against the individual right's opinion. There are also more subtle clues to this bias. For example, many times the media will claim to \"give each side coverage,\" but this is how it really works: they give the two most important tools (primacy and the last word) to the side they favor. Such a piece starts with the gun control side of the issue, and that side is allowed to frame the debate for the audience (if not already set up by the reporter's introduction). Then the piece turns to give coverage to the gun right side. After giving the gun right's side a say, the piece returns to the gun control side in closing to give it an opportunity to dispute what the gun right side had just said. The \"2 against 1\" method of covering issues is not limited to gun control, and is often used by a media that has taken sides on an issue. Additionally, watch how the reporters who cover gun issues introduce what each side says. Gun control supporters are typically quoted with positive qualifiers like \"states,\" \"shows,\" \"demonstrates,' points out,\" etc. Gun right supporters typically have their comments prefaced by more negative introductions like \"argues,\" \"complains,\" or \"would like us to believe.\" \n \n Oddly enough, though, the NRA has benefited tremendously from the statements of extremists on the gun control side as well as by the negative treatment it gets from the media. It has fostered, particularly during the Clinton Administration, a \"siege mentality\" which I believe the NRA has used to rally the troops, increase membership, and increase funding for lobbying. If you read how the Brady Campaign calls for support, you will see the same use of what it says are extremist \"gun nuts\" to fuel support from its members. I believe that the \"extremists,\" for lack of a better word, on both sides are exploited by the opposite side so often that the voices of moderation are ignored. I would like to say I am a voice of moderation, but who knows, I might very well be considered an \"extremist gun nut\" by those who want to ban guns. In the end, extremism in others is a personal opinion we hold which grows the farther someone's opinion diverges from our own. \n \n Fundamental right\n \n SCOTUS has on many occasions held that rights explicitly stated in the Bill of Rights are \"fundamental.\" The notion of fundamental rights has also been extended to unstated rights which the Court has found within the \"penumbra doctrine.\" Some rights found by SCOTUS which are not stated in the constitution can also enjoy \"fundamental right\" status if they are deemed necessary to the full enjoyment of expressed rights in the constitution. The equal protection right to an undiluted \"one man=one vote\" is one such example of a right nowhere expressed in the constitution which has been deemed fundamental because it is \"preservative of other rights.\" The famous quote, often cited by SCOTUS, which discussed this un-enumerated fundamental right principle, and included the RKBA as one of the express enumerated guarantees of liberty, said it thus:\n \n \"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This \"liberty\" is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment\". Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S., at 543. \n \n This was first expressed by Justice Harlan in a dissenting opinion in this case, but has since become the majority view of the members of the court for at least the past 30 years. In short, I believe that the RKBA is a fundamental right because it is expressly guaranteed in the constitution. I think Emmerson was wrong to not apply strict scrutiny.",

   "Just for the record, the BTK killer was by day not just a law abiding citizen but a regular church goer.\n\n \n DId he have a CCW?\n \n \nIf he did own any guns, he never used them for his murders. He would usually use rope. This is how he would bind his victims and then he would usually try and choke them. Then he would do the kind of thing that people who are aroused by dead bodies would do to the body.\n \n \n I know, this has to do with the rights to carry guns in Kansas. There were a few people commenting on law abiding citizens having the right to carry a gun for protection. My comment is that the BTK killer was able to parade during the day as a law abiding citizen. As I said in the post previos to this, that's why it took the police practically 30 years to catch him.\n\n \n Think about it. If his victims were armed then do you think the killer would've strangled even ONE of them?\n \n \nThere was an excellent documentary on court tv a while back about this. According to the guy from the FBI that they had on there, it is generally estimated that there are around 500 active serial killers operating in the US at any given time. Unless they do somethign very distinctive in their murders, or operate only locally, there is never a connection made between the crimes.\n\n \n Exactly why citizens should be armed.",
