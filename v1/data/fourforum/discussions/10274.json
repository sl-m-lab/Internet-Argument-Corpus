   "Darwinists have long said that mutations have the ability to create new information. New information, of course, would be a requirement if we were to evolve from a fungus or a bacteria floating on the primordial pond to what we are today. We certainly couldn't have gotten here if the first simple organisms (otherwise known as \"us\") did nothing but degenerate and/or lose information over billions of years.\n \n And I think we can all agree that a mutation happens within the confines of an individual....And simple logic says that for a mutation to generate a new piece of morphology or a new modification to an existing structure, that the individual must also experience an increase of information (to account for the new novelty). So, this would lead us to the logical conclusion that the individual must have had more information after the mutation than he had before the mutation.\n \n For example, if, as evos claim, a population of legless worms eventually evolved into a population of legged centipedes, then there must have been at least one mutant worm who somehow randomly sprouted legs...(I won't get into the feasibility of this here)...but in order for new legs to form, I think everyone would agree that there must have been an increase of information. (Remember, Darwinists have been arguing vigorously for years that mutations can create new information -- their favorite example is the nylon bug.)\n \n But I would like to know, if a mutation does hypothetically create new information, from where does this new information come? Remember, mutations happen within the confines of the individual.....so who's to say that this \"new\" information wasn't actually already there -- just lurking somewhere beneath the surface, lying in wait for some future need?\n \n \n If you evos cannot prove that this \"new\" information did not already reside in the organism, and you cannot show me from where it came as an alternative, then it's pretty reasonable to assume that this \"new\" information is probably not \"new\" at all. And if the infromation indeed came from within the animal, then there's no sense in saying the information is \"new,\" right?\n \n So for Darwinism to work, new information has to come from somewhere....but where?..the Tooth Fairy? The genetic code is awesomely large.....and the human body (eyes, ears, brain, immune system, etc) is insanely complex. \n \n And remember, ToE says the genome of each creature acts independently of the environment.....the genome does not \"read\" the environment, nor does it act upon it, nor does it take information from it.

   " \n \n \n \n Then define information, your continued refusal to do so only highlights your intent to employ a shifting definition for the word. \".\n\n \n Ok..I'll use Dembski's definition:\n \n Information is a complexity-theoretic notion. Indeed, as a purely formal object, the information measure described here is a complexity measure (cf. Dembski, 1998, ch. 4). Complexity measures arise whenever we assign numbers to degrees of complication. A set of possibilities will often admit varying degrees of complication, ranging from extremely simple to extremely complicated. Complexity measures assign non-negative numbers to these possibilities so that 0 corresponds to the most simple and _ [sic] to the most complicated. For instance, computational complexity is always measured in terms of either time (i.e., number of computational steps) or space (i.e., size of memory, usually measured in bits or bytes) or some combination of the two. The more difficult a computational problem, the more time and space are required to run the algorithm that solves the problem. For information measures, degree of complication is measured in bits. Given an event A of probability P(A), I(A) = -log2P(A) measures the number of bits associated with the probability P(A). We therefore speak of the \"complexity of information\" and say that the complexity of information increases as I(A) increases (or, correspondingly, as P(A) decreases). We also speak of \"simple\" and \"complex\" information according to whether I(A) signifies few or many bits of information. This notion of complexity is important to biology since not just the origin of information stands in question, but the origin of complex information.\n \n now answer my question....where does the information come from?",

   "Wonderful. SS introduces his own concepts and his own definitions (or at least he rejects ours), demands that we answer his questions in his framework, using his terms, including ones he won't define for us, and then he fails to understand that the exact answer lies before him, but his mind set won't let him see it. Then he ties it all off by saying, \"I don't care what [an expert] says.\"\n \n SS, one way to gain significant additional capabilities is through the two-step process of duplication of a gene followed by modification of one of the two versions. This can happen with one gene or a whole set of genes. For example, ignoring some minor complications, the amphioxus has one set of homeobox genes, lampreys have two, and gnathostome vertebrates have four.\n \n However, as you say and as evolutionary biologists have been saying since about 1910, random changes to genes alone aren't sufficient to generate major changes. Random mutations can produce some interesting and significant changes, but the really big changes seem too much to ask for from randomness alone. In terms intermediate between yours and ours, there needs to be some mechanism for species to find out what changes will be particularly successful to the environment etc. and additional mechanisms for the appropriate changes to be effectuated.\n \n We can go in two directions here. Your path is to jump to conclusions that there must be an intelligent or guided processes for the organism to accomplish this, for the organism to get signals and do something constructive about it. However, there is very little evidence for that. There are some processes that could help accomplish bits and pieces of it, but they appear to be very rare and/or not coordinated the way you want. Maybe we'll learn some new stuff here, but new understanding needs to come from evidence, rather than from your beliefs and wishes.\n \n The alternative is as Chemist explained. Selection (differential success at reproduction, up to and including dying before reproducing) provides the feedback from the environment to the genome. This is the nonrandomness that helps evolution along. Mutations, recombinations, and genetic drift provide largely meaningless variations, mostly as slight variations on what worked before, and if any of it works better than the old version then the new version becomes increasingly frequent in subsequent generations at the expense of the old. This alters the genome, which is in effect the storehouse of the species' answers to the questions posed by life, stated in terms of 'this is what worked best last time'. \n \n All of that happens by common processes, ones which we observe and measure in nature and in the lab, all the time.\n \n \nThe genome simply exists or doesn't exist because of what it is...it has nothing to do with reading the enviornment. Tell me, how does the genome read the environment?\n\n This is not an active reading of the environment by the genome, the species, or the organism. It is rather an imposition, a reconfiguring of the genome by the environment, similar to how culling changes the genome of a breeding stock. \n \n Organisms do have some plasticity, some options in how they respond to challenges and certainly luck plays a role in the success or failure of many, but mostly what they do when we watch them is they die or flourish according to the hand that they got dealt when they were born. Modifying their own genomes does not seem to be part of their capabilities to any great extent. (Exceptions include variable capabilities to repair some kinds of genetic damage, for example. Mate-selection is a way of modifying the genomes of their offspring, albeit mate selection mostly just involves choosing the healthiest and strongest / 'richest' mate available.)",

What is information from a scientific point of view? Fortunately, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and its similarities and differences with the natural intelligence (NI) of man may help get an answer. Since NI has a biological substratum and in any biological being information plays an important role, it is necessary to investigate the reason why the living matter uses information, the natural non-living matter does not use it (if this is quite true) and the artificial technological matter may also use it as can be seen in intelligent robots.\n \n For a general scheme of a theory of information it is supposed that:\n \n * (I). Matter is of four kinds: a)profound matter; b) non-living matter; c) living matter; d)intermediate matter.\n * (II). Information aways manifests itself on a material substratum.\n * (III). Although matter is fundamental, information is nearly at equality with matter, therefore is present beginning with the profound matter. \n \n Profound matter, after Aristotle [1] [2], has two principles, which may be interpreted now as nonstructured matter and matter which can give form to the previous one by information. This informational matter, in which information cannot be originally structural in the usual sense, has been called informatter [3]. The information in the informatter is supposed to be of the nature of phenomenological senses of the human mind and perhaps of any living being. The phenomenological information of the informatter is a physical process with a special property of sensibility of this profound matter. The phenomenological sense of the mind is of the same nature and therefore it is supposed that any living being has, in a way, access to the informatter of profound matter. On the contrary, the non-living matter gives no access, the informatter being covered by the structured(formed) matter. Therefore, both non-living and living matter are built with the same ingredients, but the living matter still has, for some reasons, access to informatter. Seen from the outside, non-living matter is structural and, may be said, formal. Living matter is structural-phenomenological or formal-nonformal. Non-living matter has also ats its origin an informational phenomenological source; living matter is always informational [4]. \n",

   "Here ya go SS. A brief discussion of the statistical mechanics of entropy. Note well that this is the core definition of the concept from which many other variants can be derieved.\n \n \n \nMicroscopic definition of entropy (statistical mechanics)\n \n Main article: Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)\n \n In statistical thermodynamics the entropy is defined as the number of microscopic configurations that result in the observed macroscopic description of the thermodynamic system:\n \n S = k_B \\ln \\Omega \\!\n \n where\n \n kB is Boltzmann's constant 1.38066\u00d710&#8722;23 J K&#8722;1 and\n \\Omega \\! is the number of microstates corresponding to the observed thermodynamic macrostate calculated using the multiplicity function.\n \n This definition is considered to be the fundamental definition of entropy (as all other definitions can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa).\n \n In Boltzmann's 1896 Lectures on Gas Theory, he showed that this expression gives a measure of entropy for systems of atoms and molecules in the gas phase, thus providing a measure for the entropy of classical thermodynamics.\n \n In 1877, thermodynamicist Ludwig Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of ideal gas particles, in which he defined entropy to be proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. Henceforth, the essential problem in statistical thermodynamics, i.e. according to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy E over N identical systems.\n \n Statistical mechanics explains entropy as the amount of uncertainty (or \"mixedupness\" in the phrase of Gibbs) which remains about a system, after its observable macroscopic properties have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic quantities, like temperature and volume, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible quantum states. The more states available to the system with higher probability, and thus the greater the entropy. In essence, the most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our ignorance about a system. The equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved quantities; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.[12]\n \n On the molecular scale, the two definitions match up because adding heat to a system, which increases its classical thermodynamic entropy, also increases the system's thermal fluctuations, so giving an increased lack of information about the exact microscopic state of the system, i.e. an increased statistical mechanical entropy.\n",

You never answered that question some weeks ago -- so theoretically (in your eyes anyway) they are the same.....so I'll ask again, if I choose to read Fortune Magazine over my wife's Reader's Digest, is the Fortune Magazine reading me as well?\n\n \n Life is largely a matter of definition and a fuzzy one at that. There is no one correct answer to the question as there is a gradation between clearly non-living and clearly living matter. The fuzzy band between the two is rather wide and difficult to apply a bright line definition to. The classic borderline case is a virus. Is it alive or not? In the proper environment it reproduces and uses metabolic energy to do so. Other borderline cases include organelles (actually endosymbionts) like chloroplasts and mitochondria. Certainly they metabolize independently and they have their own (much reduced) genomes. Somewhat on the other side of the fence than viruses please note. The we have prions which reproduce but lack both an independent metabolism AND active genetic material. And then there are the artificial systems such as self-replicating simple peptides, and other little gems like manmade viruses. In general I (and I emphasize I as its IMHO) think something is alive provided that it exhibits at some time in its history metabolism which is directed or regulated by its genes. \n \n Then we would have to get into the sticky question of dormancy - in other words organisms which are not metabolizing or replicating and which are to most intents and purposes inert. Viruses can be dormant nearly indefinitely under some circumstances as long as their DNA/RNA is not degraded. Indeed they often crystallize and remain dormant for many years either in vivo or in vitro. And of course their DNA may integrate into the host DNA and be dormant for 20-30 years or more. Prions should in principle remain active so long as their terteriary structure is not disrupted beyond refolding. Bacterial spores can remain effecctively inert for centuries in soil or other matrices {anthrax is a prime example}. S. rolfsi {one of my pet lab beasts} forms sclerotia which are very long lived (but are not metabolically active) and are extremely tough being the LAST organism to survive moving inwards toward the center of some of the nuclear bomb tests. And there are invertebrate examples like Anguina tritici a nematode whose dormant form can persist for very long periods and exhibit no significant metabolic activity.\n \n Are such dormant organisms alive or not? Depends on how you want to call it I suppose {and I am sure you will take an illogical position anyway}\n \n And I already answered your kind inquiry concerning magzines reading you in some sense they do so - although indirectly by a feedback loop.

   "Please answer my question clearly.....when an organism's genome mutates, as in the nylon bug (which was said to add information), from where does the information come?\n\n \n I will assume you read the details of the frame shift involved in the mutation. Given that its clear to anyone with a brain that the information flow was to the genes via natural selection against a new metabolic capability conferred by a rare and unpredictable mutation in a specific gene. The result of the mutation being the ability (although weak) of the resulting transcribed protein to hydrolyze the peptide bond in nylon {the otherwise inaccessible substrate}. The ability to metabolize {even if relatively inefficiently} opens a new niche for the bacterial cell {and its descendants bearing that mutation} and most likely relieves it from competition with other organisms unable to metabolize nylon. Classically an organism which can fill a new and unoccupied niche or micro-environment will expand its numbers to the carrying capacity of that niche. Its this expansion which in effect expands the genome carrying the specific mutation and thus fixes the environmental information into the population of the now more successful species.\n \n Now if you had read Adami {which you do not care to do - your loss by the way its a good paper} you would recognize that the information present in the environment had through natural selection been in part incorporated into the genome through the classical process of undirected and unpredictable mutation combined with natural selection and the resulting expansion and propagation of the mutated gene. In other words the resultant bacteria are now better adapted to their existing environment and are more fit. This kind of process results in an increase in complexity in the quantitative sense defined within the Adami paper - which you refuse to read.\n \n If you do not understand the above then don't bother to repeat the question again since that indicates you are hopeless.

They are like natural languages - they are redundant, ambiguious and have non-working parts which have been kept around for millions of years, and they have sequences which have been rendered nonworking which come from other organisms such as via viral vectors etc. Frankly its a mess - pretty much what one might expect to have evolved rather than having been designed! Kind of kludgy in fact. And you will find that I reflect the establishment view.\n \n There are SOME very efficient genomes - mostly viruses which have very restricted numbers of genes and some of those are multipurpose having more than one start and stop codon!

   "Gene duplication is neither the cause nor the result of evolution...thus, to assert that a gene duplicates, thereby increasing information content is pointless....(I don't believe gene duplication adds information anyway -- and I don't think you do either.) ToE's bread and butter is not gene duplication -- or at least it better not be -- its bread and butter is RMNS. \n Not only are you too lazy to read the literature, you can't even understand the words in front of you. I said two steps, duplication and subsequent modification. Depending on how one defines information the duplication might or might not count as extra info, but once it is modified it has certainly become additional info. We see this happening, we've got remnants and broken bits all over, and we see major structures being duplicated and modified - look at crab claws & other arthropod limbs, for instance. And again, the ToE is not just M&NS, although gene duplication is a just one of many forms of mutation.\n \n \nthe problem however (which you people have not addressed) is that mutations happen within the confines of the organism, thus, it is only logical that this \"new\" information is not new at all, but simply information that was waiting in reserves for some future need...(indicating the genome was set up to be adaptive.) And since you guys can't seem to explain to me from what other source the information may have come from other than from within the organism, then I can just assume you believe that it just \"happens\" for no reason, from nothing -- or put another way: de novo which makes you no different than a creationist in this sense. Ultimately then, every lifeform, every gene, every body part, every system, every process just \"happened\" and it all came from nothing. Right? Right. You have no choice but to accept. \n Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. You really are a complete waste of atomic particles. Additional DNA is constructed nearly entirely from water, CO2, a little nitrogen, a small amount of phosphorus, and sunshine, like the rest of your DNA and not really much different from the rest of your body, but it represents info that your body did not have before. Was all the stuff now in your adult body already present in you when you were born? Much of the information was present or at least coded for, but you've added a lot of information via experience and education (okay, bad example in your case), and you've constructed a lot more physical mass than you had originally. This is not a model that has some imaginary sky fairy going 'poof' a la creationist fantasies - it's just organisms like you and me growing up from babies to adults, and having children of our own. DNA is simply being built in your body, just like your blood vessels, nerves, bone, etc., etc. Cells make truly unbelievable quantities of DNA. They are literally DNA factories. Some biologists say that cells are the just DNA's way of making more DNA. I read somewhere that each cell in our body has about 2 m (6 ft) of it, making a total of around 100 billion kilometers of DNA in each of us, or enough to reach to the sun & back well over 300 times. (I'm going to go double check that - it still sounds incredible) In any case, it is a lot, and some of it inevitably gets copied imperfectly, adding to the amount of new information in you. (Only the parts in your gametes get passed on to you children, though.) Also remember that a goodly portion of each set of DNA never does anything, so it doesn't seem very efficient. (And before you get all excited I'm not saying that all noncoding DNA is junk DNA and serves no purpose - I'm talking about the broken genes (like the Vitamin C gene, remember than one?) and thousands of others.\n \n Edit: approximately 2 m of DNA per cell it is, although that reference calculates it as 70 round trips to the sun: see http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1998/StevenChen.shtml.

   "More and more SS and WW sound like creationists who claim that the \"kinds\" created by GOD contained all the information within them to produce all their divergent linages {Its one way of getting each \"kind\" into the ark} and that subsequent to the flood the \"kinds\" quickly had many divergent linages descended from them. Its much like a biblical tale in which a shepard exposed his sheep to various environments and got new types {EAM?, reserves of variability?} sold off the inferior strains and kept the good ones for himself. No time now to look up the details, but its in there someplace.\n \n Lets see real quick.\n \n Ah there it is Genesis 30. An example of pre-Lamarkism (aka EAM) in practice in ancient times. Sounds a lot like Lysenko but of course it did not work then and it does not work now. Good tale though.\n \n \n31 \"What shall I give you?\" he asked.\n \"Don't give me anything,\" Jacob replied. \"But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them: 32 Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages. 33 And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.\"\n \n 34 \"Agreed,\" said Laban. \"Let it be as you have said.\" 35 That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons. 36 Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban's flocks.\n \n 37 Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches. 38 Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink, 39 they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted. 40 Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban's animals. 41 Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches, 42 but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob. 43 In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.\n\n \n And if a woman is scared by a spider during pregnancy her child will have a birth mark. Everybody knows that. The spider calls forth ancient genetic memories held in reserve and the fetus shifts development to be able to defend itself {spiders fear birth marks on assumes}.",

You've already admitted as such above where you said modification was needed to increase information. But you people are the ones who have long said the nylon bug produces new information. This tells me that this \"new\" information after the mutation was not there before the mutation. So my question is where exactly did the new information come from? Chemist said from the mutation itself. But the mutation happened within the body. So did the mutation grab the information out of thin air? It must have because if it grabbed the information from somewhere in the body there is no sense in calling it \"new.\" It's the same with body parts. If there's a new modification to an existing part, where does the information come from? -- of course, from within the body. I showed a link a while back about a flea who created a spine for itself. His parents didn't have spines -- but he did. But surely he didn't grab his spine out of thin air or from a bolt of lightning.....it was already coded in his genome, just waiting to emerge when the need arose.",

   "Two steps: duplication then modification. You keep attacking first 'just duplication' and then 'just modification', but combinations can do things that parts can not do separately. At the end of that you've got more info. There is no law against increasing usable information (Dembski's wishful thinking notwithstanding), and it pretty much does come out of thin air (& water), as long as you've got a sun nearby pouring out vast amounts of energy. Where does all the extra matter come from in an oak tree relative to the acorn? - biochemical processes can feed off solar energy and use that to gather resources and reorganize them into more complicated arrangements. DNA is nothing different in this regard. \n \n You keep insisting that mutations have to come from somewhere. They certainly can have many causes: copying errors, failed separation after duplication, random cutting and splicing, damage by radiation, colchicine, & other mutagens, and so forth. When you make a typo, where did that typo come from? - It had a cause - error caused by fatigue, distraction at a crucial moment, hitting two keys & inserting an extra character, lack of knowledge concerning correct spelling, etc., and there may well be patterns (most likely you hit an adjacent key, just as methylation makes some substitutions particularly likely). However, the results of mutation appear to be effectively random compared to the needs of the organism. Most changes are deleterious, just like typos. Some are neutral or close to it - again, typos rarely make the message completely unintelligible. A rare few typos produce comical effects and can resemble freudian slips, creating new meaning. But note that regardless of what happens to the meaning, the information represented by the message has been changed. If the change happens to one of two duplicates, by almost any definition you've got brand new additional information.",

Adami paper in PNAS which deals with the origins of complexity in evolving systems.

   "\"alteration\" is not \"INCREASE\" -- which is the claim of evolutionists. Checkmate.\n\n \n Alteration is increase with change IF you duplicate, and then one or both of the versions gets altered. \n \n But let's back up a minute for an even easier concept of creating new information. You appear to want a definition of information such that 100 identical copies of the same set of 100 genes (thus 100 alleles, with no variants of any of the genes) would be taken as no additional information, correct? But you'd accept as new information the appearance of a 101st allele, correct?\n \n So here goes. A copying error alters one of the genes in one of the organisms as it is undergoing asexual reproduction. That's different, or altered information, and it's new, because it never existed before, but it's not an increase by your definition because none of the individuals have more than 100 genes - correct? It does actually represent increase in the overall genome of the species, but I'll grant that no individual has as yet increased the complexity of its individual genotype, right? However, bacteria can do conjugation, which we can think of, not entirely correctly, as sort of haphazard bacterial sex. Sometimes, the bacteria donate a set or part of a set of their genes to another, or one bacteria swipes the same from somebody else. The newly added genes can have several fates, but they can simply get incorporated into the repicipent's genome. If this should happen with the mutant, you will now have an individual with the 100 old genes plus a different version of one of the genes, i.e., 101 alleles. If this individual goes on to reproduce successfully (including reproducing his entire complement of onboard DNA), then you'll have a population with 101 genes. That is an increase in new information, relative to the organisms with the 100 genes that we started with.\n \n It doesn't really matter where this new information came from. The DNA was grown in the parental cells by preprogrammed mechanisms. The mutation could have happened due to a stray cosmic ray or alpha particle or whatever, or it could have been a statistical inevitability due to methylation. The material that made the new DNA can pretty much come thin air (H2O, CO2, sulphur, ammonia), although more complicated intermediates are likely. In any case, growing the DNA is moving against entropy, but this is not a problem because we have a sun in the neighborhood that is pouring out energy, a little of which can be used to drive secondary reactions back up the energy gradient (building ATP & DNA, melting ice, etc.). Thus the new DNA has its origins both within the cell and outside. \n \n Your concern that this is somehow not new information because it came in part or in total from inside the cell is a nonsensical objection.

That's different, or altered information, and it's new, because it never existed before, but it's not an increase by your definition because none of the individuals have more than 100 genes - correct? It does actually represent increase in the overall genome of the species, but I'll grant that no individual has as yet increased the complexity of its individual genotype, right? However, bacteria can do conjugation, which we can think of, not entirely correctly, as sort of haphazard bacterial sex. Sometimes, the bacteria donate a set or part of a set of their genes to another, or one bacteria swipes the same from somebody else. The newly added genes can have several fates, but they can simply get incorporated into the repicipent's genome. If this should happen with the mutant, you will now have an individual with the 100 old genes plus a different version of one of the genes, i.e., 101 alleles. If this individual goes on to reproduce successfully (including reproducing his entire complement of onboard DNA), then you'll have a population with 101 genes. That is an increase in new information, relative to the organisms with the 100 genes that we started with.\n \n It doesn't really matter where this new information came from. The DNA was grown in the parental cells by preprogrammed mechanisms. The mutation could have happened due to a stray cosmic ray or alpha particle or whatever, or it could have been a statistical inevitability due to methylation. The material that made the new DNA can pretty much come thin air (H2O, CO2, sulphur, ammonia), although more complicated intermediates are likely. In any case, growing the DNA is moving against entropy, but this is not a problem because we have a sun in the neighborhood that is pouring out energy, a little of which can be used to drive secondary reactions back up the energy gradient (building ATP & DNA, melting ice, etc.). Thus the new DNA has its origins both within the cell and outside. \n \n Your concern that this is somehow not new information because it came in part or in total from inside the cell is a nonsensical objection. It's a configuration that didn't previously exist, in addition to what had been known before.\n\n \n well the bolded part above I accept because one genome is receiving information from another. Bacteria evidently trade genes all the time...no argument from me that information can increase that way. \n \n So here goes. A copying error alters one of the genes in one of the organisms as it is undergoing asexual reproduction. That's different, or altered information, and it's new, because it never existed before, but it's not an increase by your definition because none of the individuals have more than 100 genes - correct?\n \n no, it's not the number of genes, it's the information within them. I think we've already concluded that a duplicated gene does not equate to an increase of information.\n \n It does actually represent increase in the overall genome of the species, but I'll grant that no individual has as yet increased the complexity of its individual genotype, right? \n \n interesting.

Do you think Hamlet could be \"unveiled\" within your typewriter? Really? Mutations do alter genes and one form of mutation is duplication, inversions, insertions, relocation, etc. Information in the thermodynamic sense of order IS increased by duplication.

Genes and other molecules are not like the elements on the periodic table...they are not fixed...they are not stable....instead, they can be manipulated and are always in flux. Hydrogen and oxygen have a natural inclination to form water.....but the molecules that all organisms share do not have an innate inclination to produce specific characters -- there are no horse molecules or willow tree molecules...instead, these molecules must be must be told how to produce horses and willow trees through chemically-coded instructions. And these instructions must come from someplace else. That is the only explanation because as we know, molecules such as genes and proteins have to be given expression to have meaning.

For example in chemical mutagenesis the mechanism is a chemical reaction (or several) of a nucleotide in which bonds are broken or made. In frame shifts etc tis the same kind of thing because i.Sts catalytic (via enzymes) and the chemistry is more complex (and even subject to corrections by existing repair mechanisms). Much the same (but again more complex) with insertions,deletions, inversions, and so forth. Its all done via chemistry. Those changes involve energy to push reactants over energy barriers an. d that involves doing work (in the physics sense). Doing such work can increase order (and thus information content) as embodied in the chemical structures involved. Should you choose to you can find a great deal of detailed mechanistic information on the multitude of reaction sequences involved and likely on the overall thermodynamics, and probably on the energetics (and work done) on the transient intermediates. Just as the proximate cause of the Pitea was the work done on the stone from which it was made, so the proximate cause of the information changes in DNA via mutation is the work done on the molecular structures.

I could call them when I get home and say \"Hi, it's Andy, just thought I'd let you know I got home safely.\" However, the same information could be communicated by simply saying: \"Hi, I'm fine.\" and hanging up, because in context, my parents can recognise my voice, they know my name, and they knew where I was going.

You might think changing a gene or reordering them is 'altering' information, but what if no organism has ever possessed that specific genetic sequence before? Isn't that new information?\n \n Thinking about information as the reciprocal of ignorance - that information is gained if and only if uncertainty is reduced - allows us to cut through all those awkward unanswerable conundrums.

And even though not all the 'information' concerning phenotypic traits is passed down via the genome, the genome certainly contributes to reducing the uncertainty. \n \n Take those moths with seasonal phenotypes, for instance; in response to the question \"how best to survive and reproduce,\" the genome says \"If development takes place in one environment, do this, if it takes place in another, do that.\" It doesn't completely answer the question, but it helps.\n \n So, onto evolution. Somewhat counterintuitively, duplications, point mutations and insertions - any mutations - don't actually represent an increase in information when you look at the species as a whole, although they do represent a quantitative increase in data. Why is this? Because they represent an increase in uncertainty: a novel genetic configuration means the the question 'how best to survive and reproduce?' just got a new potential answer.\n \n So how does information increase? Simple: what process decreases the uncertainty about 'how best to survive and reproduce?' \n \n Natural selection - the empirical testing of organisms against the environment and each other - filters out anything up to 99.99999% of the potential 'answers' in each generation, with the 'best' phenotypic answers (the most useful at helping the organism) being more likely to be among those remaining. Consequently, the 'best' genetic contributions to those phenotypes are more likely to be passed on to the next generation.

The difference between data and information is the issue. 'Two copies', or a million copies, of the same significant, meaningful, 'information', be it a cookbook or a genome, does not increase that information. It merely increases the amount of data used to convey that information, which brings us back to your earliest understanding in this post. It seems to be slipping. I'll remind you--information content is not determined by 'length of message'. Think of this when next you assert that evolution is something that takes place in 'populations', not organisms.\n \n \n\n You might think changing a gene or reordering them is 'altering' information, but what if no organism has ever possessed that specific genetic sequence before? Isn't that new information?\n\n \n **\n Not necessarily, although very possibly. Genes are only data, and they are not even that except in combinations of acid molecules. But, just as all letter combinations do not 'make sense', [ie., convey meaning, contain information], so too some acid molecule comboes may be strictly meaningless facts, that is entities with no meaningful relationship to or with anything else. That which is meaningless may be data, but it is not information, new or old.\n \n \n\n Thinking about information as the reciprocal of ignorance - that information is gained if and only if uncertainty is reduced -\n\n \n **\n And since when is the word, 'uncertainty', a synonym for the word, 'ignorance'? Ignorance can sometimes increase uncertainty, but at other times it actually increases certainty. Certainly the certainty with which a belief is held is no measure of just how true, or ignorantly false, that belief actually is.\n \n \n\n allows us to cut through all those awkward unanswerable conundrums.\n\n \n **\n Say what?!?\n \n \n\n We just need to choose an appropriate 'question' for the genome to 'answer', and we can then determine what constitutes an increase or decrease in its information content.\n\n \n **\n You cannot \"ask\" a \"genome\" anything unless and until you can \"read\" and \"understand\" any \"answer\" this \"oracle\" may \"deliver\". Such processes tend to become circular matters of 'begging the question', or being content with tautologies.\n \n \n\n The most apt question to ask of a genome is, reasonably enough, \"How best to survive and reproduce?\".\n\n \n **\n Now, just how the heck would a genome 'know' that, unless and until the organism that contains it, tells it? You seem to forget that, according to your darwinism, the genome has no clue as to the answer to that question, and could care less. All it 'wants' to do is cough up new 'genes', or at least, acidic data, and if some of this accidental sputum coincidentally results in something organic that actually affects, \"How best to survive and reproduce?\", for good or ill, ol' genome couldn't 'care' less, and doesn't 'want' or 'need' to 'know' about it.\n \n \n\n Depending on the organism, a greater or lesser degree of conscious judgement is going to be involved,\n\n \n **\n How very anti-materialist/mechanist/darwinist of you!!

Well, folks, this is it. In spades.\n The genome's 'answer' turns out to be--\"The best way to survive and reproduce is whatever turns out to be the most successful way of surviving and reproducing!!\" Duh!!

   "N. Wells, Chemist, Peeling....what do you think of this? This contradicts your suggestion that changes in nucleotides can create new, meaningful information....written by a geneticist:\n \n http://www.krishnascience.com/3_Natural_Selection_1.html\n \n We have been analyzing the problem of genomic degeneration and we have found that regardless of how we analyze it, the genome must clearly degenerate....\n \n ...The first problem we encounter in trying to create a new gene via mutation/selection is defining our first beneficial mutation. By itself, no particular nucleotide (A,T,C, or G) has more value than any other - just as no letter in the alphabet has any particular meaning outside of the context of other letters. So selection for any single nucleotide can never occur, except in the context of all the surrounding nucleotides (and in fact within the context of the whole genome). Like changing a letter within a word or chapter, the change can only be evaluated in the context of all the surrounding letters. We cannot define any nucleotide as good or bad except in relation to its neighbors and their shared functionality. This brings us to an excellent example of the principle of \"irreducible complexity\". In fact, it is irreducible complexity at its most fundamental level. We immediately find we have a paradox. To create a new function, we will need to select for our first beneficial mutation, but we can only define that new nucleotide's value in relation to its neighbors. Yet to create any new function, we are going to have to be changing most of those neighbors also! We create a circular path for ourselves - we will keep destroying the \"context\" we are trying to build upon. This problem of the fundamental inter-relationship of nucleotides is called epistasis. True epistasis is essentially infinitely complex, and virtually impossible to analyze, which is why geneticists have always conveniently ignored it. Such bewildering complexity is exactly why language (including genetic language) can never be the product of chance, but requires intelligent design. The genome is literally a book, written literally in a language, and short sequences are literally sentences. Having random letters fall into place to make a single meaningful sentence, by accident, is numerically not feasible. The same is true for any functional strings of nucleotides. If there are more than several dozen nucleotides in a functional sequence, we know that realistically they will never just \"fall into place\". This has been mathematically demonstrated repeatedly. But as we will soon see, neither can such a sequence arise randomly one nucleotide at a time.",

   "It seems to resemble the story of the engineers who announced that in theory bees can't fly.\n \n The part that you cited is a conflation of dubious claims built on a foundation that doesn't hold together very well.\n \n Take a gene, present in all members of aspecies. In one individual, change one base that causes a change in the resulting amino acid. It is true in a sense that the change is neither good nor bad in and of itself and must be assessed in the context of its neighbors, but this is not a very meaningful sentence. One amino acid change can indeed create a significant difference in the resulting protein, perhaps creating a whole new folding that dramatically changes the shape and the function of the protein. However, a slight shift in efficiency or funtion is more likely, or the difference could be insignificant, or even unnoticeable. If significant, the change is most likely going to be disadvantageous, but it could be neutral, or possibly even advantageous, with respect to the organism's usual conditions. However, the conditions may change, most likely such that something that was beneficial is now less so, and occasionally such that something that was neutral or disadvantageous has now become slightly beneficial, or at least less disadvantageous. Albinism in tigers in zoos would be a good, if artificial, example of something that is usually harmful losing its disadvantages. Genetic melanism in peppered moths in areas polluted by soot and albinism in extreme northern grizzly bears would be additional good examples.\n \n If those changes result in some new benefit, whether in some new habitat or the same old one, the version of the gene with the mutation will get selected over the long haul.\n \n Your hare krishna article insists that one changed amino acid can't do anything, that there has to be a whole series of coordinated changes. Ctyochrome c refutes this (as does every other protein), because variations in the construction of the proteins are legion - almost every species has its own version, and yet most of the different versions of cytcochrome C do the job sufficiently well. Likewise many AIDS strains differ by single point mutations, so significant changes can indeed be built up one change at a time.\n \n It goes on from there.\n \n However, I have a much simpler resolution. Since you are going to go ahead and believe the article no matter what anyone says, why don't you just go ahead and believe the article, while the rest of us save our breath and stay with scientific findings? \n \n In the meantime, here is the abstract from an actual, honest, thought-provoking scientific paper, in an upcoming Nature, at http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7158/abs/nature06107.html .\n \n Nature 449, 54-61 (6 September 2007) \n Natural history and evolutionary principles of gene duplication in fungi\n Wapinski, I., Pfeffer, A., Friedman, N., & Regev, A. \n \n Gene duplication and loss is a powerful source of functional innovation. However, the general principles that govern this process are still largely unknown. With the growing number of sequenced genomes, it is now possible to examine these events in a comprehensive and unbiased manner. Here, we develop a procedure that resolves the evolutionary history of all genes in a large group of species. We apply our procedure to seventeen fungal genomes to create a genome-wide catalogue of gene trees that determine precise orthology and paralogy relations across these species. We show that gene duplication and loss is highly constrained by the functional properties and interacting partners of genes. In particular, stress-related genes exhibit many duplications and losses, whereas growth-related genes show selection against such changes. Whole-genome duplication circumvents this constraint and relaxes the dichotomy, resulting in an expanded functional scope of gene duplication. By characterizing the functional fate of duplicate genes we show that duplicated genes rarely diverge with respect to biochemical function, but typically diverge with respect to regulatory control. Surprisingly, paralogous modules of genes rarely arise, even after whole-genome duplication. Rather, gene duplication may drive the modularization of functional networks through specialization, thereby disentangling cellular systems. \n\n Go and read the original article: some confirmations, some surprises.",

Also, irreducible complexity, sensu Behe's old definition, can arise by evolutionary processes, so this doesn't seem promising. It's no more than ornamental words here.\n \n \n 3) \n We immediately find we have a paradox. To create a new function, we will need to select for our first beneficial mutation, but we can only define that new nucleotide's value in relation to its neighbors. Yet to create any new function, we are going to have to be changing most of those neighbors also!\n Well, you could change the neighbours as well, but there's no need to. Single point mutations are perfectly capable of having significant effects all on their own.\n \n 4) \n We create a circular path for ourselves - we will keep destroying the \"context\" we are trying to build upon. \n Why?\n \n 5) \n This problem of the fundamental inter-relationship of nucleotides is called epistasis. True epistasis is essentially infinitely complex, and virtually impossible to analyze, which is why geneticists have always conveniently ignored it.\n I don't know what he means by 'true epistasis', but in normal genetics, epistasis is the effects that one gene has on another (interactions between genes). Rather than ignoring it, epistasis has frequently been the object of study. It has not normally been defined as the interrelationship of nucleotides.\n \n 6) \n The same is true for any functional strings of nucleotides. If there are more than several dozen nucleotides in a functional sequence, we know that realistically they will never just \"fall into place\". This has been mathematically demonstrated repeatedly. But as we will soon see, neither can such a sequence arise randomly one nucleotide at a time.\n\n Well, we don't necessarily need a sequence of substitutions to make major changes happen. However, if we do need a series of mutations (whether in a string or not), it is evident that such things can and do happen (if you allow for reproduction and recombination, including crossings over). As an example of stepwise changes, see http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1142819) :\n \n \nPublished Online August 16, 2007\n Science \n Crystal Structure of an Ancient Protein: Evolution by Conformational Epistasis\n Eric A. Ortlund, Jamie T. Bridgham, Matthew R. Redinbo, Joseph W. Thornton.\n \n The structural mechanisms by which proteins have evolved new functions are known only indirectly. We report x-ray crystal structures of a resurrected ancestral protein-the ~450 million-year-old precursor of vertebrate glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors. Using structural, phylogenetic, and functional analysis, we identify the specific set of historical mutations that recapitulate the evolution of GR's hormone specificity from an MR-like ancestor. These substitutions repositioned crucial residues to create new receptor-ligand and intraprotein contacts. Strong epistatic interactions occur because one substitution changes the conformational position of another site. \"Permissive\" mutations-substitutions of no immediate consequence, which stabilize specific elements of the protein and allow it to tolerate subsequent function-switching changes-played a major role in determining GR's evolutionary trajectory.\n\n \n 7) The rest of Sanford's article seems equally problematic.\n \n \nI don't know what you're talking about\n\n a) Clearly\n b) Not my problem.",

   "Tis always wise to know a bit about the authors of pieces that SS or WW quote so worshipfully.\n \n He attended two of my old schools about 5 years behind me. I hope that the teaching at those schools has not deterioated beyond all recognition. Frankly I suspect that Sanford was a fairly decent plant breeder and geneticist but lost it in the 1980s when he \"was born again\" sounds like being born again was he death of his scientific credibility and productive work. On the other hand how many of us have been given an honary priesthood by the Raelians - a very credible bunch aside of couse from the little fraud they tried to pull off regarding cloning!\n \n \nJohn C. Sanford\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \u0095 Interested in contributing to Wikipedia? \u0095\n Jump to: navigation, search\n \n John C. Sanford (born in 1950) is an American applied horticultural geneticist.\n \n Sanford graduated in 1976 from the University of Minnesota with a BSc in horticulture. He then went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he received a MSc in 1978 and a PhD in 1980 on plant breeding and genetics. Between 1980 and 1986 Sanford was an assistant professor at Cornell University, and then from 1986 to 1998 he was an associate professor. Although retiring in 1998, Sanford continues at Cornell as a courtesy associate professor. He held an honorary Adjunct Associate Professor of Botany at Duke University.\n \n Sanford is a prolific inventor with more than 25 patents. At Cornell Sanford and Theodore Klein developed the \"Biolistic Particle Delivery System\" or so-called \"gene gun\"[1][2]. He is also the co-inventor of the Pathogen-derived Resistance (PDR) process and the co-inventor of the genetic vaccination process. He was given the \"Distinguished Inventor Award\" by the Central New York Patent Law Association in 1990 and 1995. He has founded two biotechnology companies, Sanford Scientific and Biolistics. In 1998 he retired on the proceeds from the sale of his biotech companies, but continued at Cornell as a courtesy associate professor.\n \n Formerly an atheist, in the mid-1980s Sanford and his present wife Helen went through a marital crisis, which led him to become a born again Christian and a young earth creationist. More recently, he has written a book entitled Genetic Entropy & the Mystery of the Genome (2005)[3] in which he claims that the genome is deteriorating and therefore could not have evolved. Sanford's claims have received little attention from the scientific community, and have not been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n \n An advocate of intelligent design, in 2005 Sanford testified in the Kansas evolution hearings on behalf of intelligent design, during which he denied the principle of common descent and \"humbly offered ... that we were created by a special creation, by God.\" He also stated that he believed the age of the Earth was \"Between 5[,000] and 100,000\" years.[4] An analogy Sanford uses to illustrate alleged evidence of design is that of a car versus a junkyard: \"A car is complex, but so is a junkyard. However, a car is complex in a way that is very specific - which is why it works. It requires a host of very intelligent engineers to specify its complexity, so it is a functional whole.\"[5] Intelligent design proponent William Dembski touts the accomplishments of Sanford as evidence of the alleged scientific status of intelligent design [6] and has endorsed Sanford's book, Genetic Entropy & the Mystery of the Genome.[7] Claude Vorilhon has similarly praised the book, and has awarded Sanford an honorary priesthood in the Ra\u00eblian Movement.[8]\n",

   "Sanford says that series of mutations aren't going to happen, at least not in ways that improve anything. (He talks about functional strings, but that's an irrelevancy.) Behe in his latest book talks about how two changes are more or less at the outer limit of what natural selection can acheive. Well, here's a study that demonstrates a series of successive mutations that gradually increase the temperature tolerances and peak operating temperatures of a series of bacteria.\n \n Note that this study presents (1) precisely which bases exchanged precisely where in which genes, (2) exactly how that changed the proteins, (3) how that affected protein functions in vitro, (4) exactly what the effects of the changes were in the organisms, (5) exactly when in the process the changes happened, (6) how that leads to changes in terms of population genetics (by direct assessments taken over very short time intervals), and (7) a repetition of the experiment that verifies the whole thing.\n \n The study is \"In Vivo Molecular Evolution Reveals Biophysical Origins of Organismal Fitness\", by Rafael Cou\u00f1ago, Stephen Chen, and Yousif Shamoo, in the 19 May 2006 online issue of Molecular Cell (vol. 22, p.441-449). The abstract and text are on line, but unfortunately only the abstract is available unless you have a subscription ( http://www.molecule.org/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS1097276506002607 ).\n \n To emphasize how confident the authors are about how their results should be interpreted, let me cite from their conclusions:\n \n \n\n Our studies show that the essential attributes of natural selection in asexual populations, including the selection of more fit strains from preexisting genetic variation, rapid extinctions generated by clonal interference, and historical contingency, were fully realized during the rise and fall of the mutant alleles. .......... The sequence of each gene and complex three-dimensional architecture of each protein is therefore a record of selection that reflects not only fitness but also the complex historical context of evolution and strongly supports the role of Darwinian variational evolution at the atomic level.\n\n \n \n What the authors learned is fascinating, and merits description. They started with a bacterium (Geobacillus stearothermophilus) that likes moderate temperatures (45-73 deg. C), and one that only operates at slightly lower temperatures (Bacillus subtilis), and they concentrated on the gene that produces adenylate kinase, which is critical in energy metabolism by regulating the concentration of ATP. Adenylate kinase comes in numerous workable varieties, but these mutations are highly temperature sensitive. They took the gene from the lower-temperature bacteria, substituted it into the higher temperature species, and demonstrated that the new artificial form of the high temperature bacterium can no longer operate above 56 deg C. The two forms of adenylate kinase have only a 78% similarity in terms of amino acids.\n \n \n In the principal set of experiments, the authors jacked up the temperatures at the rate of 0.5 deg C per day, from 55 deg C to 70 deg C. The population was maintained at constant levels, and it went through approximately 1500 generations. Then they repeated the experiment all over again.\n \n A key part of the significance of the study is the combination of the way the authors followed what happened as various mutations arose and took over the population, and the fact that they demonstrated precisely what the mutations were and how they worked.\n \n Let me summarize the results, explain how the mutations worked, and discuss the results, in that order.\n \n \n THE RESULTS:\n \n As the temperature rose above 55 deg C, the first mutation appeared (mutant #1), and rapidly took over the whole population. This mutant variety gave rise to five new mutants (double mutants, because they all shared the initial mutation, besides having their new ones). These five new mutations first became detectable (i.e., reached levels greater than one per billion) between 59 and 62 deg C.\n \n At 62-63 deg C, the initial mutant failed to continue to be viable, and its population started to crash. It was extinct by 64 deg C.\n \n As temperatures rose from 63 to 67 deg C, one particular mutant (mutant #2) did best, but three more increased in abundance and did well for various temperature ranges, but then they also rapidly became extinct. From 65 to 70 degrees, the other two mutants thrived, but by 70 degrees only one (mutant #5) was left.\n \n The authors note that because bacteria reproduce asexually (and because no lateral gene transfer happened during the experiment), each of the mutants can be said to constitute a separate species.\n \n \n HOW THE DIFFERENT MUTATIONS OF ADENYLATE KINASE WORK\n The authors sequenced the gene that causes adenylate kinase in the original form and in all the mutations, and they also showed the composition and structure of the adenylate kinase itself. The problem is that at high temperatures adenylate kinase unfolds and can no longer carry out its function. Variants that function at higher temperatures demonstrated a variety of pathways that help increase stability at higher temperatures, without lethally interfering with the primary function. As the authors said,\n \n \n Although we were able to identify the formation of a stabilizing ion pair at the AK protein surface for mutant Q199R, the remaining mutations are quite varied in side chain chemistry and potential mechanisms of producing additional stability. Studies on protein stability have already demonstrated a wide range of mechanisms for stabilization, including formation of ion pairs, better core packing, reductions in surface loop size, \"rigidification\" of structure . . . . . and stabilization of secondary structures ..... It is very satisfying to see that in vivo experimental evolution of a population produces a variety of mutant enzymes employing a combination of these observed strategies for stabilization during adaptation.\n\n \n \n \n Here are some of the details.\n \n Mutant #1 (the first one, at the lowest temperature) consisted of a single point substitution of A to G at position 596 in the DNA, which resulted in the replacement of a glutamine at position 199 in the adenylate kinase with arginine. This was called strain Q199R, with Q for glutamine, R for arginine & 199 for the position that changed).\n \n Mutations #2 through 6 took the 199R mutant and additionally changed\n 2) C to T at position 578, changing alanine to valine at position 193, creating Q199R/A193V\n 3) G to A at position 638, changing glycine to glutamic acid at position 213, creating Q199R/G213E\n 4) C to T at position 536, changing threonine to isoleucine at position 179, creating Q199R/T179I\n 5) G to A at position 641, changing glycine to alanine at position 214, creating Q199R/G214R\n 6) A to T at position 47, changing glutamine to leucine at position 16, creating Q199R/Q16L\n \n \n The succession of dominance by the various mutations primarily reflects the combination of the stability of each mutant's form of adenylate kinase (the temperature at which it unfolds), and the temperature at which that form of AK is most active:\n \n \n\n \n Protein Max. Activity T unfolding\n Wild-type 52.3 \u00b1 0.9 54.9 \u00b1 0.1\n Q199R 52.9 \u00b1 1.4 56.6 \u00b1 0.1\n Q199R/G213E 54.2 \u00b1 1.3 59.7 \u00b1 0.1\n Q199R/A193V 55.8 \u00b1 1.1 59.9 \u00b1 0.2\n Q199R/T179I 57.0 \u00b1 0.8 61.4 \u00b1 0.1 \n Q199R/G214R 54.4 \u00b1 1.0 62.8 \u00b1 0.2 \n Q199R/Q16L 59.7 \u00b1 0.4 68.7 \u00b1 0.2 \n \n\n \n \n To appreciate how closely these tie to the ranges at which the mutant species are most successful you need to see Figure 2 in the paper. The correlation is lovely.\n \n The authors backed this up by running some experiments where various mutants were allowed to compete against each other at fixed temperatures. Mutant 1 (Q199R) wiped out Mutant 6 at 50 degrees, but the reverse happened at 58 degrees (within the range of survivability for both types, but closer to the activity peak for #6's adenylate kinase). Of the two last surviving forms at the highest temperature, mutant #6 proved itself to be an inferior competitor relative to #2 at less than peak temperatures, suggesting that stability at high temperatures comes at some cost in overall efficiency of operation.\n \n The authors confirmed their results by putting the mutant genes back into the original bacterium (Geobacillus stearothermophilus) and re-running some experiments. This confirmed the general efficiencies and sensitivities to temperature as seen in the mutants that arose during the experiments, and showed that the insignificance of any other changes outside the adenylate kinase gene.\n \n DISCUSSION:\n One very interesting finding was that the mutations needed to survive at high temperatures arose BEFORE they were needed:- the first mutation showed up at 55 degrees, although it wasn't needed until 56 degrees, and the second set of mutations following Q199R all appeared within the range of 59 to 62 deg C, whereas the original Q199R (mutant #1) is good through 62 deg. C.\n \n Note that the organisms did not settle on the solution that would ultimately be best for them. Also note that it is evident that each double-mutant lineage arose separately from mutant #1: it is not the case that mutant #2 produced mutation #3, which produced mutation #4, and so on as the temperature ramped up.\n \n Incidentally, none of the versions of adenylate kinase produced in this experiment are known to occur in nature, where better versions exist. The authors noted that there is yet another form of adenylate kinase that is in fact better at the near-high temperatures than all of the ones the experimental populations came up with, which consists of a Q16L mutation WITHOUT the Q199R mutation (unfolding temperature = 64.5 deg C). The bacteria could simply have jumped straight to Q16L, or the Q199R/Q16L line could have back-mutated to R199Q. Basically, the initial success of the Q199R mutants made subsequent solutions that avoided Q199R significantly less attainable.\n \n The authors run the numbers for how many mutations are expected to have happened given the numbers of generations, population sizes, and synonymous substitutions. They come up with 20 million point mutations. They consider this adequate to have sampled all the single-base replacement mutations, but to be inadequate for sampling more complex mutations and combinations of mutations. They estimate that they would not have recovered any mutations that provided less than a 10% boost to fitness. mturner has a little slack in here to try to claim that those expected unsuccessful mutations in fact never happened and that the creatures jumped straight to satisfactory solutions. However, (1) none of the bacteria jumped to the best possible solutions, (2) only one lineage of mutant #1 found the best of the solutions that this particular group of bacteria proposed, and (3) no individual lineages made a transition from one form of double mutation to another, despite the fact that they'd only need to accomplish another pair of single point mutations. (Also note that modern evolutionary theory would not be surprised if a mechanism had evolved to generate multiple, variably temperature-sensitive, versions of adenylate kinase in a creature that lives at moderately high temperatures, given that problems from fluctuations in temperature are likely to be part of its selectional regime throughout its history.) The authors also note that the speed at which they ramped up the temperature may have prevented some weak mutations from happening or from reaching detectable levels, which would also have precluded stronger mutations that required weak mutations as a precursor.\n \n \n The increase in diversity at 62 deg C is the result of the selection that acts as a bottleneck on the larger single mutant population and allows rapid proliferation of the double mutants.\n\n \n \n Repetition of the experiment produced four of the same six mutations and no new ones, suggesting significant constraints from both the adaptive landscape and the landscape representing potential mutations.\n \n Because the main experiment could be considered rather artificial (particularly the constant ramping up of temperature), some pairs of mutant strains were let go in a culture at constant temperature with no other interference, no other strains present, and neither strain having an advantage by virtue of being more dominant at an earlier time in the experiment, to see which strain came out ahead in unbridled head-to-head competition. This is still ultimately a test of fitness by success at reproduction, but it is an independent verification. These tests were run at a series of different temperatures, and the results confirmed earlier assessments of \"winners\" and \"loosers\" at those particular temperatures.\n \n These experiments demonstrate that protein evolution can be both rapid and dynamic.\n \n So, \n 1) Mutations arise, and the best ones become better represented in subsequent generations\n \n 2) Mutations can be beneficial.\n \n 3) The fitness of mutations is dependent on the circumstances in which the organism finds itself. (What is beneficial in one situation can be deleterious in another.)\n \n 4) Fitness is not inherently tautological.\n \n 5) Natural selection happens and can be modelled nicely in lab experiments.\n \n 6) The mutations arose prior to a need for them, not afterward in response to a problem.\n \n 7) The bacteria were unable to find a simple solution that was demonstrably better for the problem than the ones they came up with.\n \n 8) The bacteria were unable to find a simple solution that was made unlikely by prior evolutionary history.\n \n 9) Intermediate steps clearly represent the solutions that are well suited for or the best available for that particular step, rather that ideal set-ups for pursuing a particular, ideal, theoretical, evolutionary trajectory.\n \n 10) This is a wonderful set of experiments, with all sorts of secondary verifications of hypotheses and testing of predictions. It shows the lovely level of detail that can be generated from experimental work, of the sort that none of the IDists ever do. This is the sort of stuff that scientists exult in, and which Dembski famously dismissed as \"your pathetic level of detail\". I think it demonstrates nicely why ID will never get anywhere (other than politically, anyway) by relying on rhetorical arguments alone.\n \n \n Some additional info, for the sake of completeness, \n First, they started the experiment with an acclimation period. Specifically, the experiment began at 55 degrees C. The modified strain of G. stearothermophilus was acclimated for 48 hours (at 55 deg C), before they started ramping up the temperature in the way I described. 55 deg C is just under the practical upper limit for the original strain - the original strain has completely (100%) replaced by the first mutant at 56 degrees C.\n \n Second, additional details about the temperature sensitivity of the different strains of AK (adenylate kinase). For measures such as the temperature of unfolding and temperature of peak activity, there are, of course, ranges and uncertainties. The first or Bacillus subtilis version of AK reaches 50% unfolding at 54.9 deg. C + or - 0.1 deg C (as determined by circular dichroism, which they describe in an appendix), and they have a figure that shows cumulative % unfolded at specific temperatures from 25 to 90 deg. C. AK isolated from the original strain shows 10% unfolding at 45 deg C and about 1% remnant activity in vitro by 65 deg (these are my estimates from a graph that is a little hard to read). This seems a broad range, but other versions of AK show exactly parallel curves (i.e., simple offsets with identical slopes on graphs of % unfolded versus temperature), and the main part of the curve is very steep, with from 20 to 80 % of the unfolding taking place within + or - 5 deg C from the 50% unfolding temperature. The specific temperatures and the uncertainties that I gave in the table come from averaging three separate trials. Thus, temperatures for 50% unfolding can be compared meaningfully. The mean 50% unfolding temperature of the Mutant #1 version of adenylate kinase is only 1.5 degrees C higher than the starting type, and its activity peaks at only 0.6 degrees higher. Curves are also provided for activity levels versus temperature: the highest-temperature mutant AK shows a distinctly differently shaped response relative to the other mutants, but all the others are quite similar, so the 0.6 deg. value is also meaningful. To me, these differences don't sound like much, but, again, the experiment demonstrates clearly that these makes a world of difference for the two strains.",

   "Well, it's good to see that materialists are beginning to grasp the difference between 'data' [\"length of a message\"] and 'information' [meaning, significance].\n\n \n Yeah; if it wasn't for the vitalist who came up with information theory in 1948, we still wouldn't have a clue.\n \n \nWorks great when it's 'either/or'. But when the possibilities, the 'uncertainty', is more than binary, then what? If a message only eliminates, say, 20 possibilities out of a hundred, does it contain less than one 'bit' of information? Does information come in fractions?\n\n \n Yes, in the units of information theory. Just like the fraction of possibilities eliminated (1/5) is, well, a fraction, even though it relates to discrete possibilities.\n \n \nUtility isn't the issue. The difference between data and information is the issue. 'Two copies', or a million copies, of the same significant, meaningful, 'information', be it a cookbook or a genome, does not increase that information.\n\n \n Nicely cherry-picked example there with the cookbook. What about a set of directions that includes two copies of 'take the next left'? Will you get to the same place if you remove one of them? \n \n Looks like Claude Shannon might have spent a bit longer thinking about this than you have :)\n \n \nIt merely increases the amount of data used to convey that information, which brings us back to your earliest understanding in this post. It seems to be slipping. I'll remind you--information content is not determined by 'length of message'. Think of this when next you assert that evolution is something that takes place in 'populations', not organisms.\n\n \n I don't have anything extra to say; I just wanted to savour the patronising tone you adopted while being completely wrong.\n \n \nAnd since when is the word, 'uncertainty', a synonym for the word, 'ignorance'?\n\n \n I don't feel like doing the semanti-dance today, WW; uncertainty is the term used and it's perfectly acceptable. My parents are uncertain as to whether I am at home or not; my parents are ignorant of whether I am at home or not. Synonymous enough for you?\n \n \nYou cannot \"ask\" a \"genome\" anything unless and until you can \"read\" and \"understand\" any \"answer\" this \"oracle\" may \"deliver\". Such processes tend to become circular matters of 'begging the question', or being content with tautologies.\n\n \n No, you're just wrongly seeking a single source of information, where in reality there is more than one. Can we explain how an organism develops without referring to its genome? No, therefore the genome reduces our uncertainty in the matter, therefore it contains information pertaining to the construction of an organism.\n \n \nNow, just how the heck would a genome 'know' that, unless and until the organism that contains it, tells it? \n\n \n We'll get to that in a moment.\n \n \nAnd just why does the genome 'say' these things? \n\n \n Why? It says these things because that's what the data it contains means to the developmental process 'reading' it. Change the data and the developmental process will read something else, and do something else as a result. The change can be intentional (gene splicing) or accidental (random mutation); it doesn't make any difference to the effect it will have on the development of the organism.\n \n \nDuplications do not represent an increase in information any way you want look at it.\n\n \n :)\n \n \nAs for the rest, there is no reason why a point mutation would, or would not, necessarily, increase the info in the genome. The same goes for genetic insertion, where, as in language, an additional [or missing] letter can change a word, and its meaning, and an additional [or erased] word can change a complete thought, i.e., the meaning of a sentence, and all that follows from it.\n\n \n Again, you're not following information theory. If you have something better, please, let's hear it.\n \n \nHere is where you contradict your earlier stand that ignorance equals uncertainty--unless you are claiming that the more data you have, the more ignorant you are?\n\n \n Yes, in the sense that a new and untested potential 'better answer' represents an increase in uncertainty. There used to be X answers, now there are X+1, and we don't yet know which is best.\n \n \nThe genome's 'answer' turns out to be--\"The best way to survive and reproduce is whatever turns out to be the most successful way of surviving and reproducing!!\" Duh!! The genome turns out to be just as 'intelligent' as any other darwinist, apparently. \n\n \n You seem to have lost your grip, along with your manners.\n \n Each genome's answer is specific: \"My contribution to answering the question of how to survive and reproduce is this: TAGGATAGA.....\". NS just tends to filter out the answers that are empirically found to be wrong, thus reducing uncertainty.\n \n Many questions can be answered that way; you can know the right answer, or you can spam out lots of answers and have the worst ones filtered; vary, rinse, repeat.\n \n This feeds back to the earlier question of how the genome comes to possess information pertaining to 'how to survive and reproduce'. That's not really accurate. The genome acquires or loses data: duplicated genes, point mutations, insertions, deletions and so forth. What that data represents in the context of a developing organism might be better or worse or indifferent in terms of surviving and reproducing; only empirical testing will tell. And it's that testing, the removal of wrong answers and the preservation of right ones, that decreases uncertainty about the answer to the question 'how best to survive and reproduce?'\n \n \nNonsense. The genome has no clue about the environment; past, present or future. The information encoded in a geneme is about the organism, not its environment.\n\n \n Oh, I see. So we can't possibly infer anything about the environment a creature lives in from examining its phenotype? Is that what you're saying? Or are you saying genotype has nothing to do with phenotype?\n \n Or maybe you should have just relaxed your grip on that hair-trigger bile-duct of yours, and read the next line:\n \n \nspecifically, helpful hints for developing, surviving and reproducing in the environment,\n\n \n You know, like 'Take warm clothes' is information about what you should do when travelling to the poles, which by inference encodes the information that the poles are cold.\n \n \nTrue. Except that the 'data' [mutations], whenever positively meaningful, is written by the organism, into the genome as a medium, in order to convey new information to posterity that it has already acquired by relating to the data in environmental stimuli that have impacted it. \n\n \n Evidence?\n \n \nAny, 'selection', that takes place, post hoc, is irrelevent to the actual acquisition of that information, and its 'printing', but only applies to its distribution. \n\n \n Although, as I've pointed out before, it is the only explanation for how such rarely-acquired features as adaptive mutations can accumulate in a single genome.",

Dawkins, as a rule, doesn't do interviews with creationists, so this whole interview was clearly a falsity. His reasons for avoiding creationists are that they are beyond help, and that he'd rather argue with moderately religious people.\n \n if myanswer to the interviewer's question is in any way inaccurate, please tell me why.

However, the presence of endosymbionts, such as Wolbachia pipientis, within some eukaryotic germlines may facilitate bacterial gene transfers to eukaryotic host genomes. We therefore examined host genomes for evidence of gene transfer events from Wolbachia bacteria to their hosts. We found and confirmed transfers into the genomes of 4 insect and 4 nematode species that range from nearly the entire Wolbachia genome (<1 megabase) to short (<500 base pairs) insertions. Potential Wolbachia to host transfers were also detected computationally in three additional sequenced insect genomes. We also show that some of these inserted Wolbachia genes are transcribed within eukaryotic cells lacking endosymbionts. Therefore, heritable lateral gene transfer occurs into eukaryotic hosts from their prokaryote symbionts, potentially providing a mechanism for acquisition of new genes and functions.\n",

A recent information-theoretic (but intuitively evident) definition identifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores about its environment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in populations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolutionary transitions that increase complexity. We show that, because natural selection forces genomes to behave as a natural \"Maxwell Demon,\" within a fixed environment, genomic complexity is forced to increase.\n \n",
