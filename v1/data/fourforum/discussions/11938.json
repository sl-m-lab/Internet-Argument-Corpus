   "You Can Forget My Taxes\n by Melissa Etheridge\n November 6, 2008 | 2:15pm\n You Can Forget My Taxes - The Daily Beast\n \n Singer Melissa Etheridge rails against the passage of the gay-marriage ban in California-and she won't be paying the state a dime.\n \n Okay. So Prop 8 passed. Alright, I get it. 51% of you think that I am a second class citizen. Alright then. So my wife, uh I mean, roommate? Girlfriend? Special lady friend? You are gonna have to help me here because I am not sure what to call her now. Anyways, she and I are not allowed the same right under the state constitution as any other citizen. Okay, so I am taking that to mean I do not have to pay my state taxes because I am not a full citizen. I mean that would just be wrong, to make someone pay taxes and not give them the same rights, sounds sort of like that taxation without representation thing from the history books.\n \n Okay, cool I don't mean to get too personal here but there is a lot I can do with the extra half a million dollars that I will be keeping instead of handing it over to the state of California. Oh, and I am sure Ellen will be a little excited to keep her bazillion bucks that she pays in taxes too. Wow, come to think of it, there are quite a few of us fortunate gay folks that will be having some extra cash this year. What recession? We're gay! I am sure there will be a little box on the tax forms now single, married, divorced, gay, check here if you are gay, yeah, that's not so bad. Of course all of the waiters and hairdressers and UPS workers and gym teachers and such, they won't have to pay their taxes either.\n \n Gay people are born everyday. You will never legislate that away.\n \n Oh and too bad California, I know you were looking forward to the revenue from all of those extra marriages. I guess you will have to find some other way to get out of the budget trouble you are in.\n \n ...Really?\n \n When did it become okay to legislate morality? I try to envision someone reading that legislation \"eliminates the right\" and then clicking yes. What goes through their mind? Was it the frightening commercial where the little girl comes home and says, \"Hi mom, we learned about gays in class today\" and then the mother gets that awful worried look and the scary music plays? Do they not know anyone who is gay? If they do, can they look them in the face and say \"I believe you do not deserve the same rights as me\"? Do they think that their children will never encounter a gay person? Do they think they will never have to explain the 20% of us who are gay and living and working side by side with all the citizens of California?\n \n I got news for them, someday your child is going to come home and ask you what a gay person is. Gay people are born everyday. You will never legislate that away.\n \n I know when I grew up gay was a bad word. Homo, lezzie, XXXXXX, XXXX. Ignorance and fear ruled the day. There were so many \"thems\" back then. The blacks, the poor ... you know, \"them\". Then there was the immigrants. \"Them.\" Now the them is me.\n \n I tell myself to take a breath, okay take another one, one of the thems made it to the top. Obama has been elected president. This crazy fearful insanity will end soon. This great state and this great country of ours will finally come to the understanding that there is no \"them\". We are one. We are united. What you do to someone else you do to yourself. That \"judge not, lest ye yourself be judged\" are truthful words and not Christian rhetoric.\n \n Today the gay citizenry of this state will pick themselves up and dust themselves off and do what we have been doing for years. We will get back into it. We love this state, we love this country and we are not going to leave it. Even though we could be married in Mass. or Conn, Canada, Holland, Spain and a handful of other countries, this is our home. This is where we work and play and raise our families. We will not rest until we have the full rights of any other citizen. It is that simple, no fearful vote will ever stop us, that is not the American way.\n \n Come to think of it, I should get a federal tax break too...\n \n Melissa Etheridge is an Academy Award-winning and Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter.",

You have the audacity to claim that because the majority voted in a legal ballot initiative to amend the California Constitution, you are somehow above the law now, or in your twisted thing, below it.\n \n Why doesn't cali just wipe out all hate crime legislation in response to your abandonment of any responsibility to participate in your States support? Why not just ban homosexuals from working in cali, and wiping the civil laws off the books which protect your rights against discrimination in housing and work also? Or why not adopt some of the laws that exist in at least 40 other countries today where just being homosexual is against the law and can get someone sent to prison or executed. How would you like that response from your state government melissa?\n \n You radicals are a bunch of majority hating spoiled brats who have the attitude that unless you get every special right you want, then you can just opt out of being a responsible law abiding citizen as immediately shown by your disturbing the peace through these protests. You are pathetic and you sicken me for the low level of respect you have for how our (your) states constitution is designed to be amended. How sad it must be for you that the people are actually allowed to vote their consciences and not be forced to vote as you demand they vote. \n \n You are enemies of and an embarrassment to the democratic process which has worked fine until you hate mongers came along and found that crying and screaming the loudest works because people just want to shut you up. Hopefully, that wont happen this time and the state wont listen to you tactics of intimidation. Hopefully, they will respond as they do to any other bullying tactics by gangs of thugs and they will arrest you all en-masse as you attempt to disrupt the peace of neighborhoods and communities just because the people voted in a legal election not to redefine marriage to fit your warped view of what makes a normal family.",

This post clearly shows your bigoted way of thinking and just the sheer anger and HATE that spews from your posioned mind.\n\n \n I don't hate homosexuals jason, but I hate what they represent with their tactics and lifestyle. I hate their moral value system and the way they will bully and intimidate in order to attempt to recreate a civil society in their reprobate image. And I don't want anyone to live in fear of anything. Have I called for straights to unite and beat you thugs back with bats? NOT AT ALL, because I would never myself, or encourage anyone else to sink to the level of civil unrest which you so merrily wallow in. So am I angry and disgusted with what you represent? ABSOLUTELY, but don't confuse that disgust of your conduct with hatred for you, because that isn't who I am. \n \n \n I can't believe your posts now. Especially now that people won't be quiet and people won't go quietly or vanish and fear your kind anymore. The walls are being torn downleading to a brighter future. Brick by brick your old ways and hate filled ideals will come tumbling down as the mortar that held the injustice towards people together for so long.\n\n \n Let me simplify my grievance so even you can understand it jason. California had a legal election with a legal ballot initiative which is required by California law in order to legally amend the States Constitution. Thankfully, the wording was clear and concise so the people clearly understood what they were voting for. AND THEY DID VOTE! \n \n Now you anti-democratic thugs think you have the right to harass and intimidate complete groups of other americans just because you don't appreciate the results of the election. HOW DARE YOU ATTACK THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN SUCH A WAY, not to mention the people you are demonizing just for voting their consciences. The gay ethic is designed and supported by low class scum of the earth tacticians who wont be happy until they destroy every sacred institution in this Country. \n \n \nStrap yourself in and kick back and watch. Welcome to the 21st century and the change that will sweep this nation clean of hatemongersand bigots like your kind. And as far as arrested I would gladly suffer for gay rights and freedoms as I already have! \n \n Bring it on I say. Your ilk dont scare me.\n\n \n The only hate mongers and bigots showing their true colors are in your homosexual community. It isn't me who is attacking gay churches, gay clubs and individual gays. It's your gangs who are targeting specific groups and people for standing against what you represent, on moral grounds. And all those people did was vote in a legally sanctioned election. Get over it you sanctimonious thugs and respect the rule of law if you want us to respect you!\n \n How about if I start a group of straights to protest at every pro gay church, gay bar and targeted every gay couple as they walked together down the street? What would you call us? Well take that phrase and apply it to yourself you mental midget, because that is what your gay community now represents to millions and millions of law abiding americans. And I can promise you this, many people who did support your efforts before this election, don't support it now after seeing how radical, extreme and hateful you are towards people just for voting their conscience. \n \n If the ballot initiative were run again today, you would lose this one by 70%. That's how much good you are doing your cause. You are further alienating yourselves as the immoral thugs that you are. An election is a sacred tradition, right and power in America, and for you people to protest and intimidate people just for voting then you have trampled on our democratic system of governing, but you just don't get that. We have a legal system to work within, and there's always other elections. \n \n But you have no right to attempt to coerce and bully society into accepting something as important as redefining marriage just because it's important to you, with no regard for the wishes of the other 96% of us who aren't homosexuals. How utterly selfish and self centered is that attitude? So keep digging your hole. You will only serve to further marginalize yourselves from rational people who you might otherwise gain the support of if you had even an ounce of class and respect for the system we live under.",

   "It would be interesting to see if people who don't want to take part in supporting society via taxes just because a vote didn't go their way will REALLY follow through with it, and likely end up going to prison. And for that matter, let's see if they put their money where their mouth is, and have the integrity to refuse to partake in enjoying police protections, use interstates, public schools, the 911 system, take social security one day, etc., etc. that taxes provide for them. Does anyone really think this celebrity or others have the cajoles to really do it? It will be just like all the people who say \"well by golly, I'm moving to Canada if so-and-so happens\" but never really do. Hey, if these folks like the wealthy celebrity mentioned here don't want to pay taxes, they'll go to prison and society will go right on with or without them doing so.\n \n This \"well-forget-MY-taxes\" attitude is exactly the sort of thing that turns people off to movements like this, and is probably just going to make people even more likely to vote against anyone taking such an attitude. It has been said that the arrogance of SF mayor Gavin Newsom may have played a role in prop 8 by people getting turned off to the whole thing--it's this attitude of entitlement that society is supposed to redefine a major institution for a rather small group of people, relatively speaking, who already get more attention gushed on them and concessions made for them than likely any small behavior-based minority... probably in history.",

Okay, so I am taking that to mean I do not have to pay my state taxes because I am not a full citizen.\n And what is the FIRST thing jyoshu turns around and does?\n He misrepresents the argument as she just isn't getting her way on a vote... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n And jyoshu? Pointing that out is not an \"attack\".\n \n \n \nAnd for that matter, let's see if they put their money where their mouth is, and have the integrity to refuse to partake in enjoying police protections, use interstates, public schools, the 911 system, take social security one day, etc., etc. that taxes provide for them.\n\n I would be more in favor of sending Uncle Sam a reduced check. After all, shouldn't I be able to \"tax deduct\" all the extra expenses that Uncle Sam costs me by refusing to recognize my relationship?\n When Uncle Sam helps married couples with all these rights and benefits, shouldn't I be able to deduct that portion from my taxes?\n \n As usual jyoshu, you're ignoring the heart of the argument.\n This nation was FOUNDED on the ideal of \"no taxation without equal representation\" (or so the history books claim).\n \n \n \nThis \"well-forget-MY-taxes\" attitude is exactly the sort of thing that turns people off to movements like this, and is probably just going to make people even more likely to vote against anyone taking such an attitude.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n I would love to see a poll on that.\n Cause truth be told, I don't think there are that many people \"on the fence\" over these issues.\n Either they will have the honesty and integrity to recognize the TRUE argument at stake here...\n \n Or they will throw out the typical \"religion\" hard-line filled with lies and grotesque inaccuracies.\n If a person watches the \"for Prop 8\" commercials, they could come away with the false idea that churches may have to perform gay weddings. But in the time that gay marriage was legal in California, ABSOLUTELY NO CHURCH WAS MADE to perform a gay marriage.\n If a person watches the \"for Prop 8\" commercials, they see the argument that Prop 8 failing will require \"gay marriage\" be taught to kids in school. Another absolute lie, with no foundation in truth.\n \n Quite frankly, I don't even think there is any dispute in the fact that those are lies. I can't seem to get anybody on the \"for Prop 8\" side to willingly and intelligibly try to defend those lies.\n I would think that the willingness of the prop 8 proponents to lie would be more apt to turn people AWAY FROM Prop 8. And those that are comfortable with the lies? They are never going to turn away from such blatant prejudice in the first place...\n \n \n \nit's this attitude of entitlement that society is supposed to redefine a major institution for a rather small group of people, relatively speaking, who already get more attention gushed on them and concessions made for them than likely any small behavior-based minority... probably in history.\n\n \"attitude of entitlement\"?\n I just have to chuckle at the way some try to smear the idea of EQUAL RIGHTS that our constitution embraces.\n \n Yes. One of the things that makes this country great is that each American citizen IS ENTITLED to equal rights. The constitution requires a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST for withholding a right. And as Lawrence v Texas clearly established, animosity towards a group is NOT a legitimate state interest.\n \n And when you have people arguing that \"teaching gay marriage to our kids\", how can a person not recognize the express animosity? When you have people putting out such obvious lies, how can a person not recognize the express animosity?",

You can't invoke the law which restricts you as evidence you aren't restricted. The constitution DOESN'T guarantee you that 'right' any more.  That's the whole point of Prop 8--what Prop 8 does IS part of the constitution. Even if you call it \"revising\" as opposed to \"amending\", people can't reasonably argue that a change to the constitution is unconstitutional. Take the 18th amendment to the USC. It passed and went into effect, even though someone could reasonably say it took away rights. It had to be overturned with ANOTHER amendment. (gee, imagine that ... due process!)

People CHOOSE to go 75.\n There is no real inherent aspect which makes them go 75, and have absolutely no desire to go 55 while the rest of the population just naturally wants to go 55.\n \n You make it sound like I could just \"choose\" to go 55 and obey the law.\n Wrong!\n \n If you want, we can discuss the whole failed \"reparative therapy\" junk all over again, but your analogy is flawed.\n \n If you want someplace to apply your analogy, it's to RELIGION cause people CAN CHANGE their religion more easily than they can sexual orientation.\n So, the Jews want to go 75, and therefore it's okay to discriminate cause they want to be Jews???\n emoticon_xdonno",
