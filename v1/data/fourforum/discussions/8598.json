Again the non-sequitor fallacy. \n \n If you read through all the posts I did previously, I showed that objective truth must exist. I also show that it is defined outside of humanity. There must be objective truth. Let us agree at that point. It cannot not exist. That I have proven to you logically. The statement that it does not exist (or is really subjective, which is the same as saying it does not exist) is a logical fallacy as it is a statement of objective truth to make such a claim. It MUST exist. There is no way around that.\n \n Now, given that, and then look at your own statements that humans are subjective, always. That must mean, if it exists, that it cannot come from humans. If it cannot come from humans then it must come from outside of humans. This alone makes me think of God, but call Him what you will. Not totally relevant. The issue is then can it be known. It can be known if it is communicated. Regardless of whether you or I accept it can be communicated it can. An example might be that murder is wrong. (murder not killing). If that really is the objective truth, it does not matter whether or not you or I believe it to be true. It simply is true.\n \n For example: My Gas tank has gas in it. That is either true or false. Let us say for argument's sake that the reality is that my gas tank has gas in it. You can say that you do not believe it, you can get others to believe that it is empty, you can start a religion around the gas tank is empty belief. The reality is the gas tank has gas in it. It is independent of belief. \n \n Wisdom (in my opinion) is living in accordance with what is reality. I can communicate to you the gas tank has gas. If you choose to believe that it does not then you walk to the store. You can trust me, and try the ignition. The car starts and you go to the store and come back. You have lived wisely. You have placed your faith in me when I tell you it has gas. How do I know? Your action of starting the car and going to the store shows your faith.\n \n EF",

Let me try again.\n \n Assume the tank is full and Person A is trustworthy. Person A tells person B that the tank is full. Person B tests out this info by trusting person A. If person A is actually (objectively) trustworthy and the tank is indeed full then B is wise. If B refuses to trust A person B is being unwise because of the objective reality of the situation.\n \n There is an objective absolute truth. To say there is not is simply illogical.

   "I believe that absolute truths exist. They are called, 'facts', but they are only undeniable statements about entities, events, and relations. They are simple, straightforward descriptions of existence. If you can see what I describe, then we have a 'fact'. We can both see the sun, so the existence of the sun is a fact. It is absolutely true that the sun exists. Expanding, it is absolutely true that the universe exists, and it is absolutely true that existence exists.\n In short, ontology requires and absolute, factual and final truth--existence must be what it is, because \"A\" cannot be \"Not A\" at the same time and place. \n \n But what good is it to know that much? Facts are just meaningless data. When we speak of \"Truth\" we really mean a meaningful interpretation of facts that will result in a 'meaning', either in a local factual sense, such as, 'this glue will/will not stick to metal', or in the grand universal sense, i.e, 'what is the true meaning of existence?'.\n \n The real issue reduces to the question of whether or not the mere fact of existence leads to any 'true and foundational meaning' behind the brute fact of its existence.

Does that mean that they did not exist in reality before we actually identified them.\n \n Who can say that tungsten did not exist prior to its discovery?

   "**\n In hopes of having a discussion, here are some of my opinions on truth and reality. Metaphysics itself can never lead us to an incontestable understanding of absolute truth wrt reality, and certainly science never can, but it is fun thinking out loud about such things. So here's where I stand. At least, here's where I stand, for now.\n \n \n Truth is an epistemological abstraction. It does not include ontological reality, per se. That is, truth refers to relation between what \"is\", 'ontological reality', and what is \"known\", thought, believed, imagined or proposed wrt to it. The volitional exercise made to establish the quality of this realation, i.e., 'true', or 'false' is called epistemology. Science is one form of epistemology.\n \n The degree of correspondence in the scientific study of this relation is known as its \"truth value\", and that value based on the degree of predictability conferred by the epistemological construct of cause/effect regularity. That predictability, in turn, is based upon the consistency of the relation between observation and expectation, as determined, 'a posteriori'. An apple, left to its own devices, is always seen to fall to the ground, sooner or later. Hence the 'truth' of the generalization--\"All apples fall to the ground. Sooner or later, these apples, including this apple, will fall to the ground.\" The truth of that statement lies not in the apple nor in the ground, but in the behaviour of the apple vis a vis the ground. Hence, inductive logic, or inductively conceived 'truth', based upon past observation and present testing against a proposed future event.\n \n Such a truth is dependent upon generally shared experience. If anyone can demonstrate that in certain situations involving apples and 'ground', apples fail to fall to it no matter how long one waits, then the above epistemologically derived truth statment loses value. It goes from being absolutely true, to being relatively true.\n \n But, as everyone knows, certain issues are simply not amenable to inductive logic. That is, certain postulates about ontological reality cannot be arrived at via repeated sensory experience of certain specified behaviours. These postulates can only be arrived at as axioms of ontology, itself.\n \n Some of the most important axioms of ontologically, i.e., a priori, 'reality',are that A/The \"world\" which I observe exists independently of my observation of it, and is not generated by me. Solipsists deny this postulate. \n B/ That which we observe has definite properties, and by means of examining the variation in properties between what is observed in one instance, compared with another, we can discriminate between what something is and what something is not. That is, we can legitimately divide reality into different things, at least as different parts of larger things, based upon different observed properties at a given level of reduction. \n C/ This differentiation in identity creates the reality of time and space, because if \"A\" is not \"B\" in terms of properties, then \"A\" and \"B\" cannot co-exist at the same point in time and space. In the same fashion, time and space cannot exist in a reality in which a differences in properties have been eliminated and what remains is a single homogeneous entity, \"A\", and nothing else. \n D/Nothing can arise from nothing. There is no such thing as \"Creatio ex nihilo\". All that exists presently is dependent upon something that pre-existed it. Nothing can generate, \"de novo\", \"sui generis\", any quality that it as a whole, or in its parts considered individually, did not have previously. Something external to what was must be involved in order to account for what it has become. Nothing is able to spontaneously generate its own existence, in whole or in part.\n \n Working deductively from these 'a priori' logical axioms, i.e., 'truth statements', a certain metaphysical 'truth value' can be determined wrt to inferences abstracted from empirical observations.\n \n Putting the axiomatic together with the observed is as close as we can get to a 'true' understanding of reality.\n \n Hope somebody has some interesting differences of opinion.",

You really should brush up on your history before you start lecturing people who have it the past beaten you badly\n \n \nJudaism.... has been a religion since the world began.\n\n \n Not really. Juadism came out of the Israelites who existed for long before Juadism was a religion was formed. Not to mention that Paganism predates Judaism by at least a thousand or so years, probably more. Aninism is still the oldest religion of humanity. \n \n \nMost of our world history comes from the Bible\n\n \n Depends what you call \"world.\" Last time I checked, the Bible said nothing about the Americas, Asia, Southern Africa, Australia, etc. Furthermore civilizations such as the Babyloians existed prior to the bible and left large amounts of historical information. \n \n \nand the oldest manuscript IN THE WORLD is the book of Isaiah from the Bible (which prophecied Jesus' coming)..... anyways, just a few facts for you.\n\n \n wrong\n \n Which is older 212 BC or early seventh centuries BCE? \n \n There's NO WAY that the book of Isaiah is older then the manuscripts of the Greeks.\n \n Funny how you're wrong about everything yet you say you have facts.\n \n \nMan, if everyone had this mindset everyone wouldve been aborted and humans would be extinct.\n\n \n How you arrive to this outcome is unfollowable.\n \n \nIf you have no value in human life...\n\n \n Who said I have no value in human life? I implied I didn't have value in SOME humans. Not human kind as a whole. Learn to read properly and stop fabricating bull****.",

This is a truth we can be sure of in so far we witness people we know who pass and yet the world persists despite their passing. The same truth logically applies to us when we pass on - though this leads us to another ontological branch, i.e. solipsism, which I absolutely refute.\n \n Returning to the cliche question \"what is truth?\" I stand by my claim truth is ultimately a mechanism to aid human survival. Truth, life and death are each romanticised (spiritualism, mysticism and so on), but in the end the notion of truth serves to aid Mankind in his compulsive task to survive.\n \n You mock the point that ingesting poison as opposed to food is \"common sense\" a fact even. Yet although this is a physical reality of life, once communciated it becomes the truth. The sun shines is a physical observable fact. When the same phenomenon is communicated it too then becomes a truth - can you appreciate the difference here? Can you see how the concept of truth is so vital to human survival?\n \n Of course you cannot because your concept of truth is limited to a witty semite who meandered through the desert claiming divinity and by extension the end of knowledge.\n \n Your entire case rests on a grand narcissitic myth and nothing more. You can pull out a 1000 proverbs and cliches from a book of fiction, and yet prove absolutely nothing! I can do the same with Homer's Iliad, which predates your nazarene narrative by several hundred years. Tell me then why is your narrative more valid than Homer's?\n \n Us heathens prove every second of every minute, god and jc do not exist by virtue of the fact they are no where to be found except in the fertile imagination of people like you.\n \n Bubble burst archangel, emerge from the cave and join, embrace Mankind.",
