   "Ha-ha, Europeans refreshed their memory about so necessary for them oil and natural gas only when they faced the problem of energy blockade. In fact EU has missed the revolution and, thus, Europe has been late for \"division of the Eastern pie\". And as a result of it the stooge of the Bushes, Ukrainian premier Tymoshenko has blocked deliveries of Russian oil for us as well as syndicate agreement between \"Gasprom\" and \"Rurgas\". She's purposely done it in defiance of European interests and even Ukraine's interests. It's obvious she's come into great fee for this daring step and obtained safeguards against her victory during early presidential election. And the younger brother of present US President, Neil Bush called it a day during his recent visit to Ukraine. The future of 3,000 enterprises from Tymoshenko's black-list of re-privatization became the main theme of this visit. They say the resolution concerning those enterprises that Americans have got for free, has been already adopted. I think it will be so-called Ukraine's commendation for US full-fledged assistance during \"orange revolution\". According to this resolution the rest of Ukrainian plants and factories will be put up for sale among local businessmen. That's the way it is!",

It's hard to read a solid block of text like that and focus on it, so spacing it out helps us half-blind folks by making your posts readable without inducing migraines.\n \n Could you provide a bit more information as to what you're referring to, and perhaps some articles or links to support your claims? Sounds like an interesting topic but to be honest I'm not up to date with what's going on in Ukraine these days.",
