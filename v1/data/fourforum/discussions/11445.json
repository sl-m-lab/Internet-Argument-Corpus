   "OK. To compile thing from various places - \n \n From This thread - \n \nSo, 5% of all guns are involved in gun crimes in a year.\n 0.47% of all people are involved in all violent crime in a year. It'd be lower if I just included gun crime.\n \n Doesn't this imply that a gun is more likely to attack someone with a person? By which I mean, someone with a gun is more likely to commit a crime than someone without.\n ...\n I'm assuming that grizzlybear is vaguely correct in his calculation, which is introduced here, corrected here and recalculated here.\nTo add to this: if this was not the case, and guns made no difference, then the percentage of guns used (gun owners who attack, assuming a 1 gun to 1 owner relationship) would be equal to the percentage of attacks per capita: 0.46%\n If you want to claim that not all owners have more than one gun, I would point out that all gun owners must own on average 10 guns in order to decrease the 5% figure to a reasonable level.\n \n From This thread: a medly.\n \n First, evidence that guns fuel agression.\n \nInternet source (look at the first section), Psychological source.\n ...\n A quick search reveals many studies that agree with me (just Google Scholar aggression weapons, but all are abstracts (with a few exceptions - there's numbers in there, but hidden fairly well). There's also books that agree with me.\n\n I'd add to this a Wikipedia link, although this just cites thae source that I used in the first part of my above quote.\n \n Second, my claims that guns are more lethal than almost anything else - I don't think you could dispute this, but murder data would back me up (68% of murders in the US are by gun), as would many of your arguments about why guns are better defensive weapons than the alternatives.\n \n Finally, put it all together (ironically, my earliest post quoted in this one)\n \nWell, I would say that if a person has a weapon, they are more likely to take aggressive action - as you have agreed. I would also say that if someone takes aggressive action, they are more likely to cause harm if they are armed, and the better they are armed, the more likely it is that they are going to cause serious/lethal damage. You disagree with this, but I'm not sure on what grounds.\n \n Therefore, if someone has a gun, they are more likely to attack someone and more likely to kill them in an attack. I fail to see how you can deny this.\n\n \n ******************\n \n So, to summarise. I've shown that gun owners are disproportionally largely perpetrators of violent crime. I've shown that guns can make individuals more aggressive. I've shown that guns are more lethal than knives.\n \n Your turn.\n \n EDIT: Ethmi didn't like my conclusions in the other thread (first section). I included the defence in this thread, aswell.",

If criminals didn't care about going to jail then why would so many make attempts to cover their crime or run from the law? Why would they plead not guilty in a trial? If no criminal cares about going to jail; doesn't care about being caught by police or about laws than why do so few criminals turn themselves in?\n \n People commit crimes because they think that they will get away with it, generally not because they don't care about getting caught.

Unfortunately they do not distinguish how many of this total were perpetrated with a firearm.

   "@Ethmi - The gun crime figures were verified in that thread. I also seperately verified the gun ownership figures, although grizzly had overestimated - the figure is ~200mil, not ~250mil. Howeve, I see no point in going and finding the figures again because the calculation with those valid figures was incorrect. Like I said, I discard it.",

   "OK. To compile thing from various places - \n \n From This thread - \n To add to this: if this was not the case, and guns made no difference, then the percentage of guns used (gun owners who attack, assuming a 1 gun to 1 owner relationship) would be equal to the percentage of attacks per capita: 0.46%\n If you want to claim that not all owners have more than one gun, I would point out that all gun owners must own on average 10 guns in order to decrease the 5% figure to a reasonable level.\n \n From This thread: a medly.\n \n First, evidence that guns fuel agression.\n \n I'd add to this a Wikipedia link, although this just cites thae source that I used in the first part of my above quote.\n \n Second, my claims that guns are more lethal than almost anything else - I don't think you could dispute this, but murder data would back me up (68% of murders in the US are by gun), as would many of your arguments about why guns are better defensive weapons than the alternatives.\n \n Finally, put it all together (ironically, my earliest post quoted in this one)\n \n \n ******************\n \n So, to summarise. I've shown that gun owners are disproportionally largely perpetrators of violent crime. I've shown that guns can make individuals more aggressive. I've shown that guns are more lethal than knives.\n \n Your turn.\n \n EDIT: Ethmi didn't like my conclusions in the other thread (first section). I included the defence in this thread, aswell.\n\n \n I think there are some flaws in these studies that need to be addressed. First, variables that go unaccounted can play a big importance. For example, their background; do they have a criminal record, are they REALLY gun owners or people who have just seen one or shot one once. Simply stating that guns make you more aggressive is a bit of stretch. I think there can be other contributing factors for that aggression. Maybe this person was abused, drug addict, alcoholic, etc. Secondly, do criminals count as gun owners if their guns are illegally required. I can't really say yes or no, since it isn't made clear if they (those who committed murder) are legal gun owners or not; and as you stated they are disproportional. Meaning there still is a huge chunk of the population who aren't violent and own guns. Third, guns are lethal, but that depends at where you are shot. It would be nice (if anyone knows) if there is some study out there that can point out ratios of knives to guns lethality.",
