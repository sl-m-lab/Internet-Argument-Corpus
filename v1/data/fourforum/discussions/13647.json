   "What if humanity is utterly ruled by hormones, particularly testosterone, and there is no chance of true civilization?\n \n Fortunately, or so I believe, I don't think that all males are ruled by their raging hormones. These men who go beyond hormonal control are true humans who have evolved beyond the mere animal state. But, a book published in the 1990s offers interesting speculation:\n \nMen, Monkeys And Mayhem\n By Daniel Pinchbeck\n Sunday, November 17, 1996\n Wars, genocides, rapes and riots are the unhappy legacy of human history, activities seemingly coded into human nature itself. Can anything interrupt this seemingly endless cycle of victims and victimizers? According to Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson, evolutionary biologists and the authors of Demonic Males, the answer to that question lies several million years in the past, when humans distinguished themselves from their nearest primate relatives, taking their tentative first steps out of the African jungle on the way to language, culture and the atomic bomb.\n \n As Demonic Males reveals, human beings and chimpanzees are more than just country cousins. The DNA of humans is 99 percent identical to that of chimpanzees. We are, in fact, related more closely to chimpanzees than chimpanzees are to gorillas. According to the authors, chimpanzees and other ape species that seem to have changed little in 10 or even 15 million years can be viewed as \"time machines,\" taking us back to the origins of behavior that we now consider uniquely human.\n \n It was only 20 years ago when researchers learned that one aspect of this shared behavior is the proclivity of adult male chimps to attack, maim and kill other adult male chimpanzees whom they discover near their territory. Like gangsters during Prohibition or bounty hunters in the Wild West, male chimpanzees will organize raiding parties to seek out isolated members of other chimpanzee bands and then move in for the kill. In ways that eerily suggest human behavior, life for male chimpanzees is a continual jockeying for status and power. The \"alpha male\" of any group gets the lion's share of female attention as well as the grudging respect of his subordinates, who, like Brutus against Caesar, frequently plot for a way to turn the tables. Male chimpanzees also routinely batter females into submission, proving their sexual dominance through violent displays and occasional rapes.\n\n washingtonpost.com: Men, Monkeys And Mayhem\n \n I've got to say, though, that the behavior of the extremely aggressive male chimp is far too eerily similar to the behavior of a lot of human males.",

   "Hah! How about this one?\n \n \nBonobo Society: Amicable, Amorous and Run by Females \n By NATALIE ANGIER \n \n ... Far more dramatic than their physical differences are their behavioral distinctions. Bonobos are much less aggressive and hot-tempered than are chimpanzees, and are not nearly as prone to physical violence. They are less obsessed with power and status than are their chimpanzee cousins, and more consumed with Eros. \n \n As de Waal puts it in his book, \"The chimpanzee resolves sexual issues with power; the bonobo resolves power issues with sex.\" Or more coyly, chimpanzees are from Mars, bonobos are from Venus. All of which has relevance for understanding the roots of human nature. De Waal seeks to correct the image of humanity's ancestors as invariably chimpanzee-like, driven by aggression, hierarchical machinations, hunting, warfare and male dominance. He points out that bonobos are as genetically close to humans as are chimpanzees, and that both are astonishingly similar to mankind, sharing at least 98 percent of humans' DNA. \"The take-home message is, there's more flexibility in our lineage than we thought,\" de Waal said. \"Bonobos are just as close to us as are chimpanzees, so we can't push them aside.\" \n \n Indeed, humans appear to possess at least some bonobo-like characteristics, particularly the extracurricular use of sex beyond that needed for reproduction, and perhaps a more robust capacity for cooperation than some die-hard social Darwinists might care to admit. One unusual aspect of bonobo society is the ability of females to form strong alliances with other unrelated females. In most primates, the males leave their birthplaces on reaching maturity as a means of avoiding incest, and so the females that form the social core are knit together by kinship. Among bonobos, females disperse at adolescence, and have to insinuate themselves into a group of strangers. They make friends with sexual overtures, and are particularly solicitous of the resident females.\n \n The constructed sisterhood appears to give females a slight edge over resident males, who, though they may be related to one another, do not tend to act as an organized alliance. For example, the females usually have priority when it comes to eating, and they will stick up for one another should the bigger and more muscular male try to act aggressively. Female alliances may have arisen to counter the threat of infanticide by males, which is quite common in other species, including the chimpanzee, but has never been observed among bonobos. \n \n De Waal said that many men grow indignant when they learn of the bonobo's social structure. \"After one of my talks, a famous German professor jumped up and said, 'What is wrong with these males?' \" he recalled. Yet de Waal said the bonobo males might not have reason to rebel. \"They seem to be in a perfectly good situation,\" he said. \"The females have sex with them all the time, and they don't have to fight over it so much among themselves. I'm not sure they've lost anything, except for their dominance.\" \n Bonobo Society\n\n \n Those bonobos are really on top of their game!",
