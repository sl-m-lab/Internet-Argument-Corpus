   "You Darwinists have been suckered. The scientific community has suckered you into believing that just because a gene mutates and a new trait may follow, that the genetic mutation was responsible for that trait. Science has pulled a fast one on you. There is a difference between correlation and causation. The genome is what dictates genetic modifications, and a gene or genes could mutate in the process, but the mutations themselves are not the cause of anything and that's because individual genes do not work in isolation...the genome works as a functional unit. The cause of morphological change is a product of the organism as a whole, not of individually-acting genes. Besides that, genes are not generators of morphology, they are modifiers of morphology. Organisms are not the assembledge of randomly-added parts, organisms are whole units that reflect a deep pattern or ordered, purposeful relationships. This concept destroys everything about ToE\n \n But Darwinsts believe in the reductionist fallacy that a randomly mutated gene will somehow dictate a new trait. The reality is that genes do not have specific boundaries and each gene is dependent on -- and entangled with -- every other gene. Genes and their expressions are under control of the cell, and more specifically the whole body....it is subject to instructions, modifications and internal and external environmental conditions. There are many layers involved with gene experession -- it's a maze of complexity and is an extremely complicated process that science not only does not understand, but contradicts the gene-obsessed threory that is ToE.\n \n \n Fluid genome - a paradigm shift \n \n http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/08/06/stories/05062523.htm\n \n THE SEQUENCING of the human genome was completed in February this year. This was a truly historic event. Even more so because its findings were quite different from those anticipated by the large body of scientists working on the project.\n \n Announcing the findings of the HGP, Mr. Craig Venter, President Celera Corporation and one of the two most important scientists in the effort to map the human genome, put it very bluntly: ``In everyday language the talk is of a gene for this and a gene for that. We are now finding that that is rarely so. The number of genes that work in that way can almost be counted on your fingers. The notion that one gene equals one disease, or that one gene produces one key protein, is flying out of the window''. \n \n The new fluid or dynamic genome view confirms what was known but ignored by genocentric biology - that no gene works in isolation. After all, genetic interaction has been part of graduate genetics for over three decades now. The HGP also confirms what has been known for years - that DNA sequences within one gene may be used in coding many proteins. There is also no more doubt, if ever there was any, that the control pathway of gene expression is not closed and linear, but dynamic and circular. Changes in the cellular environment are sensed or measured by regulatory networks of proteins that function inside each cell. These networks interpret such signals so that the cell can make an appropriate response to these changes. Thus, protein networks feed back information from the outside world to the DNA and change patterns of gene expression in a context-dependent manner. \n \n The crucial thing to note here is that these dynamic networks have rules not specified by DNA. And this is an information management system we are only now beginning to follow. Research has started to shift in this direction.\n \n I would like for someone to tell me something. I bolded a sentence above that says \"no gene works in isolation.\" Would you please tell me, keeping that in mind, how in the world you can possibly defend a theory that has been built on the platform that individual genes mutated billions of times to define our physiological characteristics?????....and that these same genes are supposedly stable, being passed on unchanged to the next generation. \n \n ToE states that random mutations of individual genes were culled by natural selection.....but if individual genes do not work in isolation to form new traits, then what the heck????\n \n Of course science has known this for longer than 6 years. This has been concealed for decades.\n \n http://www.weloennig.de/DynamicGenomes.html\n \n Wolf-Ekkehard L\u00f6nnig\n Max-Planck-Institut for Plant Breeding Research, Carl-von-Linn\u00e9-Weg 10\n 50829 Cologne, Germany\n \n \n Thus, the \"basic genetic processes and major molecular traits\" are thought to have \"persisted essentially unchanged for more than three-and-a-half billion years\", and the molecular mechanisms of animal ontogenesis for more than a billion years. On the background of the prevailing idea of the synthetic theory from the 1940s well into the 1990s, that 'each particular gene is going to accumulate many changes over long periods of time and that this was how one organism turned into another' (Shapiro), as well as that of the many features of dynamical genetics as briefly summed up above (beginning in the 1960s and reaching its climax in the early 1990s), the discovery of the molecular conservation just documented was, indeed, 'totally unexpected' (Shapiro) and revealed, in fact, a constancy of gene functions 'to a degree beyond anyone's wildest expectations' (De Robertis).\n \n \n http://www.jax.org/education/ssp/ss06/arielle_torres.html\n \n Most genes and proteins do not function in isolation. Rather, a complex web of interactions and signals governs their function. Therefore, to understand the functional underpinnings of large-scale genome architecture, the scientific community must gain a better understanding of how genes work in concert.\n \n http://www.geneticengineering.org/dna9/default.htm\n \n Recent findings about several \"single gene\" disorders indicate that they are actually caused by different genes or gene patterns resulting in the same diseases. There are actually no simple one to one relationships between genes and traits. In such cases, the attempts at treating \"single gene disorders\" by replacing one gene are not likely to be successful. \n \n The expression of a gene is the result of a very complex interaction with the whole of the organism and is even influenced by external conditions. The stability of a gene is influenced by the condition of the organism. The genes are actually not well delineated entities as believed formerly. They may change character in response to the state of the organism and the same gene may even give rise to different proteins under different conditions. Therefore one cannot expect to be able to \"tailor\" the traits of organisms in a predictable way by insertion of \"desirable\" genes.",

FGFR-3 is a type of cell surface receptor gene for fibroblast growth factor. Altering its shape produces the changes outlined in the articles. So, though it is not directly involved in body patterning, it can still affect phenotype. \n \n It is, in reality, the vastly oversimplified creationist take on genetics that is laid low here - your inability to understand that it is not believed or hypothesized that there is a specific gene for each and every trait is your undoing.\n\n \n Genes and their expressions are under control of the cell,\n\n \n And what dictates the cells activities?\n\n and more specifically the whole body....it is subject to instructions, modifications and internal and external environmental conditions.

You are correct that \"are many layers involved with gene experession -- it's a maze of complexity and is an extremely complicated process\", but you are wrong when you write \"science not only does not understand\", and even wronger when you write \"contradicts the gene-obsessed threory that is ToE.\" \n \n Whether you want ot believe it or accept it or not, it is ultimately the genes that dictate morphology (and other things too). Certainly the environment (in its broadest sense) influences gene expression and therefore phenotype, but you will not, for example, have red hair if you lack the appropriate genetic componant to produce it.\n \n If you have a hammer, nails, and some wood, you can make just about anything (anything made of wood and held together with nails, that is), but if youhave a hammer, nails, and no wood, your constructive output is severely limited.\n \n I eagerly await your insult-laden dodging and attempts to divert the issue.",

Would that really be an example of having a fat one pulled on us?

The reality of life is that the physical is controlled by the mental and that the whole rules over the parts. What you people have tried to do is trick others into thinking that the physical rules over the mental and the parts rule over the whole. This is not an accident...this is not a mistake...this a materialist world-view in action. Don't kid yourself.\n \n \n Second, I don't think you understand the concept of consistency.

What I am insisting is that there's a REASON the gears lost a couple of teeth. You just simply glossed over that. Everything in this world has a cause...and every cause has an effect. But with your darwinian worldview, you've thrown cause out the window when it comes to mutations or morphological change. This comes from your desire that things are the way they are because of accidents or randomness....which is simply a reflection of your deep-rooted desire to opt out of personal responsibility.\n \n \n \n Also, you write:\n \n \"The genome is what dictates genetic modifications\"\n \n How does this happen? What does \"the genome\" do to modify itself, and what is the evidence for this?\n\n \n How do your fingers move just because your brain tells them to?

Random mutations (if they exist at all) could be destructive, like if someone were to randomly hit you over the head with a hammer -- but as far as new traits or beneficial morphologies, radnom mutations do not play a role. And besides that, I have serious doubts that mutations are random at all. I believe every effect has a cause.\n \n \n SS: Genes and their expressions are under control of the cell, \n \n \n And what dictates the cells activities?\n\n \n Just like genes and chromosomes and kidneys and kidney cells -- they're all under the influence of the body.
