   "Hank and I got into a religious discussion on the tax thread. I thought we should move it here. Mostly we were all over the board on theology and the bible and Jesus and so I decided to call this topic as Who is Jesus. Go to the tax thread if you want to see how things got started.\n \n Hank:\n \n I can see where you might have trouble accepting the bible as the authority on the bible. However, at some point there must be a final authority. There is one part where it says that God swore by himself. I thought it interesting as, who else would the almighty creator of the universe swear by but himself. There is no higher authority. \n \n The point I was making is that Peter, an apostle, consider Paul's writing to be on par with scripture of old. That term was not used loosely during that time. \n \n So, do I understand you correctly? Are you saying that the words of Jesus are valuable but the remainder of scripture and the context are questionable? Help me out here.",

   "So, do I understand you correctly? Are you saying that the words of Jesus are valuable but the remainder of scripture and the context are questionable? Help me out here.\n\n \n Okay you asked so here goes.\n \n First I don't think anyone can come to the truth until they abandon all beliefs and appeal to the Holy Spirit for the truth. I understand I may be biased as that was the path it took for me. But what I obtained from that experience was that there have been those that have a very close relationship with God and their teachings can be looked to for answers. I don't believe anyone has or ever has had the perfect truth. But in general there are some that have been close. And the short answer to who those people are is as follows:\n \n Look at the person's life, especially three things. Did they spend a lot of time in prayer and meditation, did they abandon material things so that their statements and decisions are not influenced by outside considerations, do their teachings and sayings in general agree with the sayings and teachings of those that have been accepted as great religious men by the world. I say the last one because I believe there is something inside mankind that recognizes the God that is in all of us when it is strongly manifested. I will add that it seems that often a fasting to death as a way to show dedication often comes right before some kind of major revelation for those great men.\n \n Since Jesus is the one I know the most about, he's the one I look to the most. So the basic message of Jesus is what I see as the truth. (I'm not talking about the super-natural stuff that I think was added afterwards to give authority to Jesus by his followers). That doesn't mean I would not give any credence to others in the Bible, just that I would look at everything in light of the message of Jesus.",

It&#8217;s not that I pick what I want, it&#8217;s that I compare what is said to the teachings of Jesus and see if they agree. Although I have a high regard for the Bible, the other parts are not important to me as spiritual truths. I believe Jesus said everything that needed to be said. But I do appreciate the Bible as a testament of the Jewish people&#8217;s history of their developing relationship with their deity.\n \n \nWhat if you are wrong? Since you are human and fallible it is quite possible you know.\n\n \n Of course I&#8217;m human and fallible. And that&#8217;s an interesting statement and not the first time I&#8217;ve heard it. But I&#8217;ve never really discussed it with anyone before. So I will present my case, and state what I thank your case is, and you can comment on what I have said if that&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;ve already stated what I believe and why to some extent so some of this will be a repeat.\n \n My position is that when Jesus said the Holy Spirit would answer a sincere heart, I took that as true. I prayed and asked for answers until I finally decided to give up every belief I had, except for a belief in God, and asked for help in obtaining the truth for me. At that point I was willing to believe anything, no matter what it was. And I believe I got that answer. So if I am wrong, it is because I took the words of Jesus at face value. And if I am wrong, it&#8217;s not because I didn&#8217;t ask, or go into the relationship with pre-existing beliefs.\n \n Now let me state the case for where I think you are wrong. There may be some assumptions in here that are incorrect but you can point them out. I think the basic argument will still be correct. If you have been a Christian all your life, then you have never given God the chance to change that. In other words, you have said I want to know the truth, but don&#8217;t tell me Christianity is wrong. But even if you were not a Christian all your life, I assume your beliefs are based on the Bible as the word of God. So where did that belief come from? Have you just always believed it, or is it because someone told you it was. And why is that true? I believe the letters of Paul were the first to be written and that was some 30-40 years after the death of Jesus. Paul never talked to or saw Jesus. The gospels were written 40-90 years after the death of Jesus and there is no proof that the authors were who the Bible says they were. But I&#8217;ll even give you the authors. So why did these books get picked for the Bible. Well because a group of men, which were fallible also, decided they should be there for one reason or another. So I would ask you, why do you accept a group of books, decided by a group of fallible men, as the word of God? My argument would be, at least I have a personal experience that I believe was from the Holy Spirit that inspired my beliefs. I don&#8217;t tell others they are wrong, just that this has been my personal experience. It seems you on the other hand have accepted the beliefs of others as your beliefs because they have said so.\n \n So my argument is, I base my beliefs on what I consider to be the Holy Spirit in my life, and to me, that is better than what I had before which was based on someone else&#8217;s beliefs.\n \n Okay what do you think?",

By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of antichrist...We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and he who is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.\" \n \n This quote sounds exactly like what you are talking about.

I've already stated what I believe and why to some extent so some of this will be a repeat.\n \n My position is that when Jesus said the Holy Spirit would answer a sincere heart, I took that as true. I prayed and asked for answers until I finally decided to give up every belief I had, except for a belief in God, and asked for help in obtaining the truth for me. At that point I was willing to believe anything, no matter what it was. And I believe I got that answer. So if I am wrong, it is because I took the words of Jesus at face value. And if I am wrong, it's not because I didn't ask, or go into the relationship with pre-existing beliefs.\n \n Now let me state the case for where I think you are wrong. There may be some assumptions in here that are incorrect but you can point them out. I think the basic argument will still be correct. If you have been a Christian all your life, then you have never given God the chance to change that. In other words, you have said I want to know the truth, but don't tell me Christianity is wrong. But even if you were not a Christian all your life, I assume your beliefs are based on the Bible as the word of God. So where did that belief come from? Have you just always believed it, or is it because someone told you it was. And why is that true? I believe the letters of Paul were the first to be written and that was some 30-40 years after the death of Jesus. Paul never talked to or saw Jesus. The gospels were written 40-90 years after the death of Jesus and there is no proof that the authors were who the Bible says they were. But I'll even give you the authors. So why did these books get picked for the Bible. Well because a group of men, which were fallible also, decided they should be there for one reason or another. So I would ask you, why do you accept a group of books, decided by a group of fallible men, as the word of God? My argument would be, at least I have a personal experience that I believe was from the Holy Spirit that inspired my beliefs. I don't tell others they are wrong, just that this has been my personal experience. It seems you on the other hand have accepted the beliefs of others as your beliefs because they have said so.\n \n So my argument is, I base my beliefs on what I consider to be the Holy Spirit in my life, and to me, that is better than what I had before which was based on someone else's beliefs.\n \n Okay what do you think?\n\n \n I tell ya, take a weekend off the computer and you never know where things will go. Much has been said and I will respond to others later. \n \n Plotter, I specifically will respond to your question as it is honest and very interesting. \n \n Hank:\n \n I appreciate your candor. However, your characterization is incorrect. I have not been a christian all of my life. I grew up with an agnostic or gnostic father. NOt sure which as he did not describe it much. We had a family bible but no one in my family understood squat about it so no one talked about it. I came to know Jesus by faith at age 27. It was not because of what someone told me. It was by what I saw. I found a place where people actually lived and breathed like Jesus was alive and active in their lives. They did not live perfectly and for many not even well. But they gave me the room to be me. To question and doubt and wonder what was true and to test the truth. And when I was wrong, no one told me I was wrong, they let me wrestle with it and with God. The guided me in reading the bible and understanding it. I am coming to a much deeper understanding than I ever had. I see God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit. They are active and more real to me than most people I know. \n \n I saw all of this going on and asked myself why? I asked them why? The answer I got through prayer and sometimes direct report of the people who lived this way was because Jesus was real to them. \n \n You say Paul never talked to or saw Jesus. Paul was a member of the San Hedrin and studied under Gamaliel. This is the very group who chose to crucify Jesus. There is nothing in scripture that says Paul (or rather Saul of Tarsus) was at this \"trial\" but there is no reason to think otherwise. The pharisees had frequen contact with Jesus. Secondly, Paul met Jesus personally on the road to damascus. He was blinded and spoke to Jesus himself and Jesus revealed himself to Paul. Paul's heart changed drastically after that day. The writings of Paul are the most prolific in the New Testament. The writings of Luke (The gospel and the book of Acts) were told to him from Paul. \n \n How do I know these things? Because the Holy Spirit is alive inside of Me. Only God can reveal it, I believe. Why do I trust the Canon of the bible? I believe it was God who superintended the writing and the collection. How do I know this to be the case, I find that the bible, The revelation of God to mankind, to reveal God accurately. I find that if I take statements out of context, I see a different God than the one I have experienced. There you have it, my beliefs are not based on some hugaboo but rather on my experience of the Living God.\n \n Now, since we seem to have opposing beliefs it seems that one of us would be incorrect. I suppose it is possible we are both correct given the incredible bigness of God. \n \n Plotter: I have answered you vaguely in the above statements. I will be more specific. I do not \"follow what is written without questioning.\" First, I do not follow what is written, I follow a person, Jesus. Second, I do not do so without questioning. It is precisely my questioning that allows me to follow. If I had no doubts then I would have no faith. Faith is made strong when a peron doubts but still chooses to believe. This is what I mean when I say \"testing the truth.\" I know in my mind what is true. Sometimes it doesn't feel very true. I doubt. I then choose to believe what I know to be true in spite of the feelings and doubts. If what I believe to be true is really true then my faith becomes stronger because I find that my feelings and doubts lied to me. Feelings are such whimsical things. Dickens said in \"A Christmas Carol\" (paraphrased) that our senses and feelings are decieved by a bad piece of meat. (\"There is more of Gravy than the grave about you.\")\n \n However, the Bible has lasted for about 1500 years if not longer. The old testament scripture for several thousand. Few other books in the world have that kind of staying power. Additionally the impact on the lives of people for the better has been enormous. This is true of other writings as well however so it proves little. \n \n To be certain, I did have others telling me what was true and what was not. However, that has never changed me, nor anyone else I know. It is the experience of the great mercy and grace of God that changes people.",

Peter was one of the disciples, as was James. I think Jude was also. The only New Testament book whose author is in doubt is Hebrews. The theology and doctrine and statements of that book are so in line with the rest of the bible and its writing has been set at around 64-68 AD. It was included in 1Clement which places it sometime before AD 95. It does not mention the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 and that event would have argued strongly for the doing away with the sacrificial system (a strong topic of Hebrews) and it mentions the release of Timothy placing it's date in the late 60s.\n \n The rest of the bible is fairly well established with similar info.",

I was at peace with that thorn of my questioning after reading Chesterton's words. He elucidates the fact that we must be thankful that God was a \"jealous\" god. We must also be thankful that the Jews were jealous with their God. If God had not made war on all of those other nations then the truth and uniqueness of monotheism would not have been preserved. The Jews were always falling into idolatry and into worship of other peoples' Gods. God smashed these falsehoods with the fury of a god. He made war on false gods to preserve the true God. If he had not, then the God of the Jews would have melted away into the mass of pantheism/polytheism.\n \n Also, if one looks at some of the psalms and other places, God's mercy is already spoken of in the Old Testament--sometimes with a striking familiarity of that in the New Testament (I know that seems backwards, the familiarity of the New Testament in the Old but I meant it that way--as the Christian sometimes looks at it from that view).",

   "I'm not aware of anyone else at that time who was teaching what Jesus taught. But then again, I'm not well read.\n\n \n Buddha stated the silver rule 500 years before Jesus &#8220;Do not do to others what you would not have done to you&#8221;\n \n In the Old Testament, Micah in chapter 6 shows that the consciousness of man was already moving towards a belief that God wants mankind to deal justly and mercifully with his fellow man, not to sacrifice animals.\n \n [6] Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?\n [7] Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\n [8] He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\n \n There are many others, these being only a couple of the most familiar. \n \n \nYou say that one should interpret for themselves so that nothing will tarnish what is truly in the teachings of Jesus. Then you say that all of the different denominations out there prove that the Bible can be used for almost anything. But don't you see that private interpretation is the very reason that there are so many different denominations? There can only be one authority to interpret scripture or chaos will result. (The authority is that granted in Matthew 16:18.)\n\n \n No I don&#8217;t say one should interpret for themselves. I say that one should read the teachings of Jesus and ask the Holy Spirit for the interpretation. My argument is this maximus, someone or some group has to do the interpreting. If I pray and sincerely ask the Holy Spirit for guidance, then I feel I have done what Jesus said to do. I could not abrogate the responsibility of something that important to me to someone else. I don&#8217;t mean to criticize you, just commenting on my feelings. What if the authority you are talking about gets it wrong? And they have gotten it wrong in the past.\n \n My reference to the many different denominations was this. Jesus brought a simple message. It&#8217;s not that difficult to understand, especially if you read it without preconceived notions and through prayer. However if you bring in all the other books of the Bible and other outside documents, then you can get almost any interpretation you want. So my intent was to say that if you use ONLY the teachings of Jesus, without anything else but beseeching the Holy Spirit, I don&#8217;t think there would be very many different interpretations. But if you use everything else, you get all kinds of interpretation.\n \n \nI meant to post this earlier and perhaps someone has already asked and I missed your reply but, how do you know that the sayings of Jesus/teachings of Jesus that you follow are reliable any more than the parts of the Bible that you throw out? Is it simply through fasting and guidance of the Holy Spirit?\n\n \n I think it is somewhat amusing that you say throw out when I think of it as not including. But I know what you are saying.\n \n If you mean reliable in the sense are they the accurate recordings of what Jesus said, then my answer is I believe the non-supernatural parts are reasonably accurate because Jesus obviously had an big impact on many people and that would be reason for many to remember his words. But the supernatural parts were added because the church wanted to establish authority.\n \n If you mean reliable in the sense are they better teachings than anyone else, then I believe they are similar to other great men of God and people recognize that in those type of people. But fasting and praying are the main reason I believe in his teachings.\n \n I have asked you the same thing before and you didn&#8217;t answer. How do you know the Bible is reliable?",

They had no reason to write about him until he gave them one of his most influential commandments \"go out and make disciples of all nations.\"\n \n Now, anyone trying to invent a story of a deity might have been concerned with filling up every detail of Christ's life. They might have attempted to portray a divine precocity and wonder-workings of youth. That is why some writings were rejected by the Church--they were not authentic and their tall tales could be distinguished from the truth.

The people who wrote about him were just as calm in describing his divinity. There are no outrageous exploitations or fabulous fantasy miracles.

   "Hi, sorry to butt in just wondered if anyone would care to read these thoughts on the person of Jesus. The following is quoted from a book called 'Reasoning on the Scriptures' published by the 'Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society'. (Scripture citations are added)\n \n Jesus Christ is the only-begotten Son of God (Pr. 8: 22), the only Son produced by Jehovah alone. This Son is the firstborn of all creation. By means of him all other things in heaven and on earth were created (Col. 1: 15, Rev. 3: 14). He is the second-greatest personage in the universe (John 17: 5, Ps. 110: 1). It is this Son whom Jehovah sent to the earth to give his life as a ransom for mankind (Matt. 20:28, 1Tim. 2: 6), thus opening the way to eternal life for those of Adam's offspring who would exercise faith (Ro. 10: 4, Gal. 3: 22, John 3:16). This same Son, restored to heavenly glory, now rules as King (Matt. 24: 3< + 2Tim. 3<), with authority to destroy all the wicked and to carry out his Father's original purpose for the earth (Gen 3: 15). The Hebrew form of the name Jesus means \"Jehovah Is Salvation\"; Christ is the equivalent of the Hebrew Ma\u00b7shi'ach (Messiah), meaning \"Anointed One.\"",

How do you or anyone know they didn't add them or edit them?\n \n \nIf they truly were added later, then why do you trust anything you read at all in the bible. \n\n \n Because there is no reason to doubt that Jesus just talked about life and relationships with God.\n \n \nYou are incorrect about the bible diluting Jesus. It is the revelation of Him. It only shows who He is more clearly.\n\n \n And I think you are incorrect. Just like what we talked about in Jesus saying to his disciples to sell everything they had. You want to dilute that by showing where in other parts of the Bible he really didn't mean that. The fact is that the church would never be able to grow if they took that literally. Very few individuals are willing to do that. So the church had to say 'well he really didn't mean sell everything'. He just meant don't let money be a god. They had an agenda. And really so do you. If you took that literally, you would have to abandon your beliefs because I don't think you would sell everything. And you're not willing to do that. \n \n \nMore precisely. We have a God who wants to be known. To be known so badly he manifested himself directly to the nation of Israel, He superintended the writing of scripture, and He sent His son to represent him and die for you and me and rise again on the third day. Jesus was either who he said he was or he was a nut. That much logic is strongly supported.\n\n \n Your logic would be correct if you could show that he said that. He didn't. So your logic fails.\n \n \nIf we use your logic then the whole of the bible is suspect and one can know nothing of Jesus.\n\n \n You want to say the Jesus was God and delivered his message while he was here on earth, but he needs other humans to explain what he said? And you think my logic is suspect? Yours is the one that is suspect to me.\n \n So can you explain to me why Jesus needs the rest of the Bible to explain his message? Did he not express it correctly, or was he not capable of talking correctly, or did he not realize people would not understand what he was saying? Just what defect was in his message that caused this misunderstanding?",

   "The context of John 1:1 MUST be taken in to account when translating the verse, John 1:18 says that \"no one has ever seen God\" verse 14 clearly says, \"the word became flesh and dwelt among us\" (no contradictions in the Bible), also John 1:1,2 say that the word was \"with God\", so how can you be with someone at the same time as being that person?\n Interesting to point out is that the translators who stubbornly translate John 1:1 \"the word was God\" do not hesitate to use the indefinite article (a, an) in their rendering of other passages where a singular anarthrous predicate noun occurs before the verb.

   "'Hebrews 1:8' \n Quotes from 'Reasoning from the Scriptures' (WBTS)\n Which rendering is harmonious with the context? The preceding verses say that God is speaking, not that he is being addressed; and the following verse uses the expression \"God, thy God,\" showing that the one addressed is not the Most High God but is a worshiper of that God. Hebrews 1:8 quotes from Psalm 45:6, which originally was addressed to a human king of Israel. Obviously, the Bible writer of this psalm did not think that this human king was Almighty God. Rather, Psalm 45:6, in RS, reads \"Your divine throne.\" (NE says, \"Your throne is like God's throne.\" JP [verse 7]: \"Thy throne given of God.\") Solomon, who was possibly the king originally addressed in Psalm 45, was said to sit \"upon Jehovah's throne.\" (1 Chron. 29:23, NW) In harmony with the fact that God is the \"throne,\" or Source and Upholder of Christ's kingship, Daniel 7:13, 14 and Luke 1:32 show that God confers such authority on him.",

I get very frustrated with people who won't actually argue the point and turn it into something else. \n \n Jesus disciples do become one entity. \"The Body Of Christ.\" It is not just purpose but actual oneness with the Father Son and Spirit through the indwelling of the Spirit. You don't answer all of the scripture. It is just as easily said that the scripture that you quote refers only to purpose or role.

I think Maximus or Montalban have more historical knowledge than I do. Why was his childhood not recorded? The issue, I think is this. Jesus came to earth to be a man. It was part of his purpose. If it was known widely that he was indeed God become a man at the time then he would not have been a normal man. There are lots of things that are not readily available from history. We know very little about Pontius Pilate for instance. He was over Jerusalem for a fair amount of time. However, to date only one stone, a highway marker, has been uncovered with his name on it, other than writings of Josephus and the bible. (and those writers referring to the bible). We know he existed and he was well known. Even better known than Jesus. \n \n The theology is that God came to earth to live a sinless life as a man. Jesus constantly referred to himself as the son of man. His ministry didn't really start until he was about 30. At that time some started recording information about him. Or realised that they should shortly after his death 3 years later. Much of the time of what people call his infancy was actually birth to three. He would not have been that well known.\n \n Alexander the great had a great deal of wealth and power. He had the command of many to write biographise. Jesus was a poor carpenter, itenerant preacher. There were many of them and during that time many claiming to be the messiah. He did not have money and did not command people to write biographies due to his humility as opposed to alexander's vanity. These are all good and logical reasons. I hope this is helpful.",

If I tell you to read the teachings of Buddha, are you going to run out and get books on what he taught?\n\n \n Yes, I would hope that you would abandon your beliefs for the sake of following the revelation of truth that was given to us by God who came as man. I think John and Peter were closer to the mark.\n \n \nIt seems disingenuous to argue that the church has only been wrong on scientific issues where they can be proved wrong and never been wrong on faith and moral issues where there can be no proof.\n\n \n I'm not sure to what you are referring.\n \n \nI agree that the apostles gave up everything for their beliefs. And I admire and respect them for that. But it is also true that later when the church obtained political and civil power, they used that power to suppress and persecute other beliefs. So there was a transition period between when the followers of Jesus only had what power was the result of persuasion due to the truth of their message and persecution due to their civil power. I was referring to that time period when I thought text were added to and changed to give authority to the church. Maybe authority is not exactly the right word but I was hoping you would understand what I was talking about.\n\n \n But the Church has not changed its teaching. It has been constant for about 2,000 years. If you look before the \"transition period\" and after the transition period you will find the same teachings. I'm not sure when that \"transition period\" was supposed to have occurred in history.\n \n Have you read any information from the Jesus Seminar, Hank?",

   "Only Hank and EF have responded to the above post i made earlier, and only hank made a valid point, EFs response was confusing, Ef can you please stop answering with quotes from the bible.\n \n The recording of jesus's life is totaly contradictory. \n \n Hunderds of years before his birth other events in history were recorded with far more accuracy, for example Alexander the great and so on.\n \n So i ask again the above question, (which has yet to answered with reason, common sense and facts) Why wasnt jesus's teenage years and his twenties written about? Was it because he wasnt known? and the virgin birth added later to make him sound more important?\n \n If thats the case, does that mean the church has lied?\n \n What ive noticed in these religious debates is that when someone asks an akward question, defenders of the bible tend to shy away and ignore the question or they start quoting irrelevent lines from the bible.\n\n \n Plotter, \n I did respond to your post concerning the documentation of Jesus' childhood and teen years. See Post 52 Page 11.\n \n Interesting that you think the events of Alexander the Great's life were recorded with accuracy because I think the source of that information comes from writings dating about 800 years after Alexander's life. In contrast, the most liberal estimates of when the accounts of Jesus' life were written would fall between 70-100 years I believe.",

   "Hank,\n \nBut that doesn't explain why Mary or Joseph would not have written about Jesus's early life since they knew he was the son of God. Jesus didn't say that until he was grown. \n \n It may not explain that. But we can't explain many things. This does nothing to refute the truth of what is documented. And as I wrote in my earlier post, it more likely proves the authenticity of what was written. They weren't concerned with airbrushing everything in Jesus' life. \n \n Here are a few guesses though:\n 1. A mother and father might have been busy with other things.\n \n 2. They might have been illiterate. I have heard somewhere that Mary was probably learned but I can't remember the source right now. I think it is also known that Joseph was much older than Mary and might have not been around very long in order to write.\n \n 3. Jesus never commanded anyone to write anything down. Remember that the Jewish culture was largely one of oral history. It wasn't an information age like today.\n \n Maybe I can come up with a few other possibilities later.\n \n \nBesides just saying my hour has not yet come doesn't mean 'don't tell anyone about my youth'.\n\n And lack of documentation of one's youth does not mean what is reported about one's adulthood is fabricated.",

   "This seems the appropriate space to make a Biblical defence against the false teachings of Christ. I have read a lot of these posts and it seems clear to me that there are a lot of people making their own interpretations of Christ (Mark 7:13). There are also a number of claims that the Bible in some way says that Jesus is God or God incarnate, something that the Bible refutes (John 14:28, John 20:17, Phil. 2:6).\n\n \n None of the verses you supply concerning God incarnate refute the claim. Phillipians 2:6 seems to but not when you read Paul's other writings. Collosians 2:9, \"in him dwells the whole fullness of deity  bodily.\" In human form he humbled himself to be like us and emptied himself of his divine attributes at times.\n \n Not only did Jesus claim to be God but those around him knew he was claiming to be God:\n \n John 5:18  \"he not only broke the sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God.\"\n \n When he said, \"I and the Father are one\" why did the Jews pick up stones to stone him? John 10: 30-31 The answer is in line 33, \"The Jews answered him, 'We stone you for no good work but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God.\"\n \n Why did the Jews want him crucified?

   "Buddha was not at his time, you said he was 500 years earlier. I don't say that to be smart aleck, just to suggest that Jesus' thought did not come from Buddha. Jesus' teaching in the context of Christian religion is not what Buddha's teaching was in the context of Buddhist philosophy. \n\n \n Yes Buddha was not at his time. But Jesus is not at my time, yet I know his teachings. And the golden rule may not have come from Buddha's silver rule. But they look very similar so there is a fair chance that it was discussed in his time and he knew about it. That's all I'm saying. I was just replying to your comment that you didn't know anyone was talking about the things Jesus was teaching.\n \n \nYes, I would hope that you would abandon your beliefs for the sake of following the revelation of truth that was given to us by God who came as man.

It caused quite a bit of mischief in how they treated others that didn't believe that. They have now apologized for that error in their belief because there is so much evidence that to dispute that would be ludicrous. That is a example of the church admitting they were wrong on scientific issues where they were proved wrong. But science doesn't deal with faith or moral issues so the church can say whatever they want to and never have to admit differently. However as I understand it, the Pope didn't stand up for the Jews during WWII. If so, I would personally say he was wrong in that stance. But I admit I haven't read a much about that issue so I'm not sure of the details. I'll do some checking if I get a chance.\n \n \nBut the Church has not changed its teaching.

There were many differences in beliefs and the established belief had to be worked out.\n \n \nHave you read any information from the Jesus Seminar, Hank?\n\n \n No.",

   "I don't have the ducation to directly answer the virgin birth issue. I think Maximus or Montalban have more historical knowledge than I do. Why was his childhood not recorded? The issue, I think is this. Jesus came to earth to be a man. It was part of his purpose. If it was known widely that he was indeed God become a man at the time then he would not have been a normal man. There are lots of things that are not readily available from history. We know very little about Pontius Pilate for instance. He was over Jerusalem for a fair amount of time. However, to date only one stone, a highway marker, has been uncovered with his name on it, other than writings of Josephus and the bible. (and those writers referring to the bible). We know he existed and he was well known. Even better known than Jesus. \n \n The theology is that God came to earth to live a sinless life as a man. Jesus constantly referred to himself as the son of man. His ministry didn't really start until he was about 30. At that time some started recording information about him. Or realised that they should shortly after his death 3 years later. Much of the time of what people call his infancy was actually birth to three. He would not have been that well known.\n \n Alexander the great had a great deal of wealth and power. He had the command of many to write biographise. Jesus was a poor carpenter, itenerant preacher. There were many of them and during that time many claiming to be the messiah. He did not have money and did not command people to write biographies due to his humility as opposed to alexander's vanity. These are all good and logical reasons. I hope this is helpful.\n\n \n Im sorry EF, there are too many contradictions, in fact everything you say just doesnt make any sense.\n \n You say jesus was god, ok, if he was, then why did he have to be born, god created everything remember, why didnt he just suddenly appear as a man in his 30s and do what he did.\n \n Now you cant answer that by saying, he wanted to see what man was like, because hes god and he sees everything and knows everything. he also didnt have to convince people by living a life, as nobody knows anything about what he did for 30 odd years.\n \n And why did he choose to be \"born\" in israel and live a jew, why didnt he get \"born\" in china or sweden or africa or america?\n \n You see its all contradiction.\n \n On the other hand if he was the son of god, (which may make more sense)\n Why did he have to learn anything, why didnt god give him all his knowledge? Now if he knew he was the son of god, then he also knew that no real harm could come to him. \n \n So if people know that he was god or the son of god, then why is his death so important? You say hes god, others say hes the son of god, you cant kill god can you? So you cant say he sacrificed himself for humanity, because he didnt die, so if he couldnt die what sacrifice was there?",

   "Okay if he chose that, then why didn't he say 'hey I didn't explain everything so you could understand it so look for someone else to explain my words'? (Actually he did but it was the Holy Spirit.) I would think he would have at least given us some indication that he needed the help.\n \n \n \n If I have the burden of proof that Jesus was not God, then you have the burden of proof that he was God. Your statement is an extraordinary statement that requires extraordinary proof as they say. I can't prove that those things were added to the Bible, but it's at least logical. And you can't prove that Jesus said those extraordinary things but it's a huge step. The Jews fought that battle for centuries against other religions that claimed God and humans interacted. \n \n Suppose I said Alexander the Great was a person in history and there were several things written about him. Then I showed you some documents that were purportedly written about him. Would you have any trouble believing that? But now suppose I said that Alexander the Great's father was God because his mother said he was. Now it is true that his mother said that so does that make it true? And he believed her and said so. He certainly was an extraordinary person so he had some actions to back up the claim to some extent. I would bet you would reject that idea. But if you take the Bible saying a man is God, why do you not take others, and there are many, where people say their father is God or people say that about them?\n\n \n You can prove that parts of the book of John were added by the church? Then do so. I did not claim that he was god (although I probably did at some point) What I claimed was that HE CLAIMED to be God. This was in response to your claim that he never said that. I and others posted verses from the bible where Jesus did claim it and you said you could prove that they were added. The burden of proof that they were added and that he never claimed to be god is rightly yours. Please provide your evidence that Jesus never said what he said.

You say hes god, others say hes the son of god, you cant kill god can you? So you cant say he sacrificed himself for humanity, because he didnt die, so if he couldnt die what sacrifice was there?\n\n \n I will try to handle your questions one at a time.\n \n If he was god why did he become a man? No it was not to see what it was like but rather it was necessary for Jesus to live as a man so that His sacrifice would be acceptable. He wasn't trying to convince people he was God. He was God and He came to show us who God is. He did that and it is recorded specifically in the Gospels.\n \n He chose Israel because of a promise He made to Abraham, and Isaac, adn Jacob, and David. He promised where the messiah would come from. He promised that the saviour of the world would come from the seed of Abraham. Why did He choose Abraham in the first place? That one I don't know. Why does God choose anyone? Only God knows the answer to that.\n \n If he was the son of god why did he have to learn anything? Jesus set aside the expression of his glory as God to live as a man. It is an expression of humility, the ultimate expression of which is that He allowed humans to torture Him and Hang Him on a cross so that mankind could be saved from themselves.\n \n If he was the son of god then he knew that no real harm could come to him. Sort of true. He trusted his father. That much is true. However, He was fully God and Fully man. As a man He felt sorrow, pain, suffering. He didn't desire the suffering He knew was coming. This is why he prayed in the garden of gethsemane \"If it be your will, let this cup pass from me.\" He didn't want to have to suffer, but He was obedient because he trusted His father. As I said before, he set aside the expression of his attributes and took on the imitations of a human and therefore did not know everything as a man. God the father and the spirit still knew.\n \n As to your last paragraph, You are correct in that no one could take the life of God. Yet Jesus chose to allow himself to die. he descended into Hell for three days. For three days he was separated from the Father. The father then ressurected him. That is how we know the sacrifice was acceptable to God. Jesus suffered and died. You say God cannot die. why do you say that? he did. He also rose again. Death was defeated on that day. It is why christians celebrate easter, it is a celebration of new life. \n \n Baptism is a symbol of it. When a person is dunked under water (my denomination) it symbolizes the dieing to sin and the returning to the surface is the ressurrection to new life. \n \n The old testament contains many shadows of Jesus sacrifice. You have probably heard the term \"scapegoat.\" It means basically to blame one person for everything so the whole group doesn't get slammed. In the old testament as part of the ritual sacrifices, one day per year the israelites would lay their hands on a goat (without blemish) symbolizing the placing of their sins onto the goat. They would then chase it out of the village, and just to ensure that it not return (and so return their sins to them) they would chase it off a cliff.\n \n Jesus came to allow the world to lay their hands on him and take on the sins of the entire world. He lived perfectly and He died for sins he did not commit. He raised again on the third day and ascended into heaven and was seated at the right hand of the father. The right is a place of honor and being seated is what the king would do when the battle is won. The king would not sit on his throne while at war until the war was over and the battle won.\n \n Granted some of this is a matter of faith. I cannot prove much of it. You say there are contradictions. You are wrong about what you think is contradictory. There are paradoxes to be sure. How could Jesus be both God and Man. Paradox, you and I cannot reconcile it with our feeble minds but God certainly can. \n \n That is the best I can give for now. Good luck.",

   "Here is a link to a website that lists four or five short studies on this issue. I will also post some excerpts.\n \n http://www.themoorings.org/apologetics/Gospels/relia1.html\n \n Over five thousand Greek manuscripts of the New Testament in whole or in part are extant today (1). By comparing the manuscript evidence for the Gospels with the evidence for other important ancient writings, we see that the Gospels are uniquely well attested. The work best preserved after the New Testament is Homer's Iliad, represented by 647 manuscripts (2). Many other works rest on a very tenuous foundation. There are only nine or ten copies of Caesar's Gallic War, and none is earlier than A.D. 800 (3). Livy's history is based on only twenty manuscripts, Tacitus's history on only two (4). Of the eight manuscripts of Thucydides' history, only one is earlier than A.D. 500 (5).\n \n In addition, there are many thousands of ancient manuscripts preserving versions of the New Testament in languages other than Greek (6). Among these versions are the Old Latin and Old Syriac (Aramaic), both of which originated well before A.D. 200 (7). Others represented in the manuscripts include the Armenian, Georgian, Coptic, Ethiopic, Arabic, Gothic, and Slavonic (8).\n \n The many manuscripts and versions agree with each other to a remarkable extent. Most variant readings are misspellings or other obvious errors. It has been estimated that doubt attaches to only one word out of a thousand (9), and none of the words in dispute is crucial to deciding any question of history, ethics, or doctrine. \n \n some headings for the third lesson:\n Absence of Inaccuracies Pointing to a Later Date of Origin\n Absence of Deviant Theologies Influential during the Second Century\n Inclusion of Facts That Only the Contemporaries of Jesus Would Have Known\n \n \n read through the material, it certainly provides for interesting information.\n \n Edited to add one more thing:\n \n Unflattering Treatment of the Apostles\n \n The Gospels are unmercifully critical of the chief apostles. Matthew remembers when James and John grasped for the highest places in the kingdom that they expected Jesus to establish soon (Matt. 20:20-24). Luke does not conceal how John provoked the Lord to rebuke him twice, once because he had forbidden someone to cast out devils in Jesus' name, once because he, in company with James, had sought to bring fire from heaven upon the cities of Samaria. We read even that Jesus accused John of having another spirit (Luke 9:49-56).\n \n The Gospel portrait of Peter is everywhere unflattering. In one incident after another, we see his faults and failures. After he resisted the preaching of the cross, Jesus addressed him as Satan (Matt. 16:23). On the night of Jesus' arrest and trial, Peter forsook the Lord and denied Him with oaths and cursings (Mark 14:66-72). On one occasion Peter actually spoke to Jesus with extreme impudence. When Jesus desired that the woman with an issue of blood would courageously step forward and identify herself, He asked who had touched His garment. Peter replied, in essence, that the question was foolish, since people were pressing Jesus on every side (Luke 8:45).\n \n Considering that the leaders of the early church allowed, even sponsored, the general distribution of writings so critical of themselves, what may we say about these men? We may, without risk of being too generous, say that they were honest (9).",

You must have a very low opinion of me to think that I would even consider going back to that kind of turmoil. \n \n I am sorry for your trials of life but Jesus did not guarantee that life following God would be without turmoil emotionally or otherwise. In Matthew 10:34  he says, \"Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.\" Jesus also said that we must take up our own cross and follow him.\n \n \nWell for instance the church believed that the earth was the center of the universe and everything else rotated around it at one time.\n \n I don't think the Church ever made a statement on that.\n \n \nIt caused quite a bit of mischief in how they treated others that didn't believe that. They have now apologized for that error in their belief because there is so much evidence that to dispute that would be ludicrous. That is a example of the church admitting they were wrong on scientific issues where they were proved wrong. \n \n I don't think the Church ever apologized for a belief. As I said above, I don't think they made a statement on the earth being flat or round. They did apologize for their handling of Galileo. Have you ever heard of Copernicus? He originated the theories that Galileo made famous. He was on very good terms with the Church. There were other issues involved in the Galileo situation.\n \n \nHowever as I understand it, the Pope didn't stand up for the Jews during WWII. If so, I would personally say he was wrong in that stance. But I admit I haven't read a much about that issue so I'm not sure of the details. I'll do some checking if I get a chance.\n\n If your understanding is that the Pope didn't stand up for the Jews then you don't understand the history of that situation very well. I can give you information, including statements from Jews themselves, praising the Church's help in saving thousands of Jews during the war. (To clarify: don't misunderstand me and think I am saying that a pope cannot sin when I say that the Church has not been wrong in its teaching).\n \n \nFrom the time of Jesus' death, during the time the books of the New Testament were being written and the theology was being formed, and up to the time when the church became the official state religion. There were many differences in beliefs and the established belief had to be worked out.\n\n Let's re-examine these issues:\n \n 1. Jesus claimed to be God and those around him knew that he was claiming to be God--see my earlier posts concerning both of these issues\n \n 2. if the claims of the authors of scripture concerning Jesus' divinity were embellished or made up then we have no reason to trust that they didn't make up Jesus' teachings either\n \n 3. there was no apostasy or abandonment of Jesus' teachings early in the Church--the Church's teachings have not changed, what is said in scripture flows with what the early Church discussed and taught--\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Divinity_of_Chirst.asp \n \n 4. the early Christians were not attempting to garner authority as is evidenced by their willingness to give up their earthly life and any authority they might have (not just the apostles either, many after them were martyred)\n \n Peace.",

   "Plotter,\n \n \nYou say jesus was god, ok, if he was, then why did he have to be born, god created everything remember, why didnt he just suddenly appear as a man in his 30s and do what he did.\n\n \n Because He didn't want to.\n \n \nNow you cant answer that by saying, he wanted to see what man was like, because hes god and he sees everything and knows everything. he also didnt have to convince people by living a life, as nobody knows anything about what he did for 30 odd years.\n\n \n I responded to your questions on this with 2 posts. Have you seen them? What do you think?\n \n \nAnd why did he choose to be \"born\" in israel and live a jew, why didnt he get \"born\" in china or sweden or africa or america?\n\n \n Because He wanted to be born in Israel. He could have been born in China, Sweden, or Africa, or America. But then you would be asking why he was born there and not in Israel.\n \n \nYou see its all contradiction.\n\n \n Not really.\n \n \nOn the other hand if he was the son of god, (which may make more sense)Why did he have to learn anything, why didnt god give him all his knowledge? Now if he knew he was the son of god, then he also knew that no real harm could come to him. \n \n \n Because He wanted to learn. Because He didn't want God to give Him all His knowledge. Because \"he emptied himself  and did not count equality with God something to be grasped at.\"\n \n To summarize:\n Was it necessary that Christ come to us in the form of man? Was the incarnation of Christ needed by God our Father to bring about our salvation? \n \n No.\n \n God is omnipotent and omniscient so it is a denial of God to say that he could not grant us salvation without embodying Himself in Christ. Yet, he sent Christ, though He is capable of performing Christ's mission Himself without taking on human form (excluding any Trinitarian chicken versus egg tangents). Why did He do this? We can never fully know. We can never fully grasp, as humans, God's plan and will. Yet He did will that Christ be our Savior. Perhaps, it was the best way to make humans understand (as much as possible) his plan. He related to us on our level.",

   "I think I could provide reasonable achaelogical evidence that the manuscripts that we do have are authentic and represent accurately what was originally written.\n\n \n Well you&#8217;d be the first so I&#8217;d like to see it.\n \n \n There is more proof concerning their authenticity than there is for the authenticity of the writings of socrates, plato, aristophanes, etc, all of which are generally accepted within the archaelogical community. (I probably could find others but would need some time). The bible is the most studied archaelogical item in the world. I will see what I can get a hold of as far as authenticity of the manuscripts. Certainly the dead see scrolls provide a great deal of evidence for the old testament. I will have to look for the info on the gospels specifically.\n\n \n Socrates and Plato wrote themselves and there are no supernatural claims in their writings as far as I know.\n \n \nAs far as debate parlances go, the burden of proof lies with the person who makes the original claim. You stated that Jesus did not claim to be God. I and others countered with, \"yes he did\" and provide scripture references for evidence. You then stated that the scripture that says that was added by the church. You have now made two claims, both of which require you to provide evidence to support your claims. That is what I mean by burden of proof.\n\n \n In post #56 you claimed that &#8216;Jesus claimed to be God&#8217;. I think up till that time I had only talked about what I thought. The only &#8216;proof&#8217; you have offered for that claim is that someone wrote it down. I don&#8217;t know how you consider that as proof. There are many things that are written, that doesn&#8217;t mean they are true. I can make post after post of things that are written that I&#8217;ll bet you will agree aren&#8217;t true. \n \n It can&#8217;t be proven by either of us regardless of who said it first so I&#8217;m not even debating who said it first. I think I was careful to say what I thought until you started making statements and I started replying in kind. But that didn&#8217;t mean I thought I could prove it, I was just replying as you were.\n \n \nNow, I realize you may not actually be debating but discussing. I typically look at these threads as debates not discussions. This is why I refer to \"burden of proof\". I will accept it if you do not wish to provide counter evidence, however, that really nullifies your argument that Jesus didn't make that claim. We have provided more evidence that you and your only attack is that we can't use that evidence in spite of no evidence to validate your position. \n\n \n There is no evidence for either side. You can quote the Bible from now till the crows come home but it doesn&#8217;t prove anything because we don&#8217;t know if the Bible is accurate or not. Something that was written 30 or so years after someone has died and by someone who obviously was biased is not a reliable witness, even if you knew who wrote it. And you still have the distinct possibility that things were added or edited between the time of the original writings and the copies we have today.",

   "I will try to handle your questions one at a time.\n \n If he was god why did he become a man? No it was not to see what it was like but rather it was necessary for Jesus to live as a man so that His sacrifice would be acceptable. He wasn't trying to convince people he was God. He was God and He came to show us who God is. He did that and it is recorded specifically in the Gospels.\n \n He chose Israel because of a promise He made to Abraham, and Isaac, adn Jacob, and David. He promised where the messiah would come from. He promised that the saviour of the world would come from the seed of Abraham. Why did He choose Abraham in the first place? That one I don't know. Why does God choose anyone? Only God knows the answer to that.\n \n If he was the son of god why did he have to learn anything? Jesus set aside the expression of his glory as God to live as a man. It is an expression of humility, the ultimate expression of which is that He allowed humans to torture Him and Hang Him on a cross so that mankind could be saved from themselves.\n \n If he was the son of god then he knew that no real harm could come to him. Sort of true. He trusted his father. That much is true. However, He was fully God and Fully man. As a man He felt sorrow, pain, suffering. He didn't desire the suffering He knew was coming. This is why he prayed in the garden of gethsemane \"If it be your will, let this cup pass from me.\" He didn't want to have to suffer, but He was obedient because he trusted His father. As I said before, he set aside the expression of his attributes and took on the imitations of a human and therefore did not know everything as a man. God the father and the spirit still knew.\n \n As to your last paragraph, You are correct in that no one could take the life of God. Yet Jesus chose to allow himself to die. he descended into Hell for three days. For three days he was separated from the Father. The father then ressurected him. That is how we know the sacrifice was acceptable to God. Jesus suffered and died. You say God cannot die. why do you say that? he did. He also rose again. Death was defeated on that day. It is why christians celebrate easter, it is a celebration of new life. \n \n Baptism is a symbol of it. When a person is dunked under water (my denomination) it symbolizes the dieing to sin and the returning to the surface is the ressurrection to new life. \n \n The old testament contains many shadows of Jesus sacrifice. You have probably heard the term \"scapegoat.\" It means basically to blame one person for everything so the whole group doesn't get slammed. In the old testament as part of the ritual sacrifices, one day per year the israelites would lay their hands on a goat (without blemish) symbolizing the placing of their sins onto the goat. They would then chase it out of the village, and just to ensure that it not return (and so return their sins to them) they would chase it off a cliff.\n \n Jesus came to allow the world to lay their hands on him and take on the sins of the entire world. He lived perfectly and He died for sins he did not commit. He raised again on the third day and ascended into heaven and was seated at the right hand of the father. The right is a place of honor and being seated is what the king would do when the battle is won. The king would not sit on his throne while at war until the war was over and the battle won.\n \n Granted some of this is a matter of faith. I cannot prove much of it. You say there are contradictions. You are wrong about what you think is contradictory. There are paradoxes to be sure. How could Jesus be both God and Man. Paradox, you and I cannot reconcile it with our feeble minds but God certainly can. \n \n That is the best I can give for now. Good luck.\n\n \n Thank you EF for such a long reply.\n \n However im afraid everything you state is still all contradictory\n \n You say, he lived as a man to make his sacrifice more believable, now that makes sense, but nobody knew anything about him untill he died, and even then it was only for the last few years of his life, how can that make people believe he was god? In other words the bible goes to great lengths to tell us he was no ordinary man, he was god, so why would he then appear like a man, you said yourself there where others claiming to be god.\n \n You say he chose israel because of a promise, why? if hes god why should he have to make promises, what made these people special? If they were special to god, why where they? God doesnt discriminate, or does he?\n \n You say, he decended into hell for 3 days, but wait a minute hes god, he created hell, he wasnt actually going to suffer was he, and besides he was there for only 3 days, he knew he could leave at anytime. So if hes god, how could he die and ressurect himself, in other words he was only pretending, thats no real sacrifice.\n \n You also say he ascended to heaven, and took his place, hold on, you mean he returned to heaven dont you? thats where hes always been. \n \n And becoming a scapegoat just doesnt make sense, there have been other scapegoats in history, but they were never labelled god, but i suppose it makes a good point, he made himself a scapegoat of humanity, now thats a very heroic act, but hes god, no harm can come to him. But i can see it being seen as a very heroic act, and heroic acts are always remembered.\n \n so in otherwards he left heaven, became a man, to teach us we were wrong and to put us on the right track, killed himself to prove a point, but being god he was able to ressurect himself then went home to heaven. Thats effectively what he did.\n \n You say its not contradictory, its a paradox, im afraid i cant see how it can be a paradox, the whole story is full of contradiction, ill tell you why, because people claim hes god, If he was an ordinary man sent by god to spread a message of faith, then nearly all of the contradictions will be explained.\n \n But no, he was born from a virgin.\n Nobody knew anything about him untill just before he died.\n Then he rose from the dead. \n \n Now they are just a fraction of the contradictions. Nobody has yet to explain these events with facts, common sense and logic, i have a funny feeling no body will.",

Remember the goat had to be one without blemish. But God was not satisfied with this as an animal woithout blemish could only remove the sins of israel for one year. They had to do this every year. Jesus is a once for all sacrifice. God sacrificed His only son so that we might know eternal life. This is the nature of Love.",

We were dead. He came to give us life. He did not kill himself but rather allowed himself to be sacrificed. He did not ressurrect himself. The father raised him from the dead. He defeated death. In so doing we have, once again, the opportunity to live. \n \n \n Do you not understand the definition of paradox. They are seemingly contradictory statements which are nevertheless true. If he was an ordinary man full of sin then the sacrifice would be unacceptable. Remember the goat had to be one without blemish. But God was not satisfied with this as an animal woithout blemish could only remove the sins of israel for one year. They had to do this every year. Jesus is a once for all sacrifice. God sacrificed His only son so that we might know eternal life. This is the nature of Love.\n\n \n I do know what a paradox is, i also know what a contradiction is.\n \n What you fail to understand is that, if he was god, or the son of god. Then there was no danger to him, he CANT die, because he was god. You said earlier he allowed himself to die, cant you understand what a contradiction you are saying? If he allowed himself to die, then there would be no more god, but because hes god, he ressurected himself, therefore he didnt die, so what sacrifice was there?\n \n I cannot understand why the bible writers wrote that he was god, or gods son, when he made every effort to hide the fact that he was god..contradiction.. On one hand, he pretends to be an ordinary man, to make his point believable, but at the same time he says hes god, he cant be both hes either a man, and so he died. end of story. Or hes god and he was never in danger and the whole thing was pointless.\n \n All he had to do was, appear, preach, prove his point, and go back to heaven. he didnt have to fake his death.\n \n Simply put, he is god, do you understand what im saying, he is god. Why did he have to resort to trickery, why was he afraid of his enemys?\n \n As far as the goat is concerned, thats another contradiction, Why is it neccesary to sacrifice a goat, sacrifice was a pagan ritual, why would god want his people to perform such a barbaric pagan ritual? All contradiction.\n \n And the explanation as to why he came to earth as a jew, is simply nonsense.",

A basic principle even of human justice is that the price paid should fit the wrong committed.\n If Jesus, however, were part of a Godhead, the ransom price would have been infinitely higher than what God's own Law required. (Exodus 21:23-25; Leviticus 24:19-21) It was only a perfect human, Adam, who sinned in Eden, not God. So the ransom, to be truly in line with God's justice, had to be strictly an equivalent-a perfect human, \"the last Adam.\" Thus, when God sent Jesus to earth as the ransom, he made Jesus to be what would satisfy justice, not an incarnation, not a god-man, but a perfect man, \"lower than angels.\" (Hebrews 2:9; compare Psalm 8:5, 6.) \"\"\n \n The fundamental thing to consider in trying to squeeze the Trinity doctrine into the scriptures is that it causes outright war in the Bible, scriptures conflicting in almost every way, contradictions are commonplace, even the grand theme of the Bible comes under assault. \n \nOn the other hand if he was the son of god, (which may make more sense)\n\n Absolutely, peace returns to the Bible if this is the understanding.",

   "Okay, now there are just getting to be too many people that I am arguing with. \n \n Richard, take your Jehova's witness garbage elsewhere. I have already proven that the watchtower version of the bible is poorly translated as you add phrases and use your doctrine to determine what the bible says rather than the other way around. \n \n Plotter. You are being stubborn. God is three persons,. Father Son and Holy Spirit. I can not teach you all of theology or doctrine on this thread. I have presented arguments with evidence and analysis as to why it can be and all you keep coming back with is that they are contradictions and therefore cannot exist. \n \n Hank:\n \n I think you and I are stuck on this point. Let me ask you this question, why do you believe that Jesus actually said that we should sell all that we have to enter heaven? Then why not believe that He said he was God? I agree with you that in many books one picks and chooses what one believes. Because men are fallible. However, the book we are talking about is about 2000 years old (younger to be sure but I'm close). There is no one around to ask about it, no reviews other than 1500 years worth of commentaries. All of which say that he said he was God. \n \n The only ones claiming to be christian who doubt that are the Jehova's witnesses and their translations are extremely suspect given that they didn't first appear until the late 1800s when their doctrine had been developed for over 50 years. They also use very poor skills in translation and utilize prooftexting which is where they translate in order to make it say what they want. This is only 100 years or so old. This is obvious by remarks made on this thread and in reading the watchtower bible itself. \n \n Now, you say that the church added the idea that he said he was god in order to improve the authority of the church. That seems odd since that statement only proves the authority of Jesus not the church. Also, since you say it was added, I countered with the authenticity of scripture, in particular the verse in John that Maximus quoted where Jesus says I and the father are one.\" He also says that \"if anyone has seen me, he has seen the father\" John chapter one says that \"In the beginning the Word was with God and the Word was God. JW's translate that as \"a\" god, but there is no indefinite article in the greek so that is a very poor translation and words inserted where none existed. \n \n Hebrews also says that Jesus was God. Now I know that most of those are not statements made by Jesus but they point to the ones he did make as being authentic given the time of the writing of the various passages. It is only logical.\n \n You cannot pick and choose with the bible. It claims to be the word of God. And that is likely our sticking point. I don't think you think it is. Therefore you treat it like any other book. It is not like any other book. The site I posted points out in one of the lessons that no other manuscript in history has the matching up of ideas and beliefs and statements like the bible does and it was written across thousands of years. If that is not a miracle I don't know what is.\n \n Plotter: God chose to do things the way he did. He revealed himself directly to the children of israel as the wandered in the desert for forty years. They still strayed, it is in human nature to do so. God is and must be accepted on faith. I cannot prove to you his existance. If you want to see contradictions that is what you will see. If you want to know the truth, educate yourself a bit more on the bible as the statements you are making point to someone with little knowledge and a lot of prejudice. Hank, while he and I disagree a lot, is at least quite well educated on the bible.",

Let me directly oppose you and the herecy that you teach. The reason that God himself died is to show the love of God. You ignore all of the scripture that says he was god. The pooint of Hebrews 2:9 for instance is that GOD, in humility, became intentionally lower than the angels to prove himself. You take the scripture out of context. Foolish. There is nothing wrong with paradix in a God that is so big that the human mind cannot conceive him completely. Frankly, a God that makes perfect sense to me is not big enough for the problems of Humanity. You ignore John1 and you trust a translation that is based totally on prooftexting. Try studying a real greek text and learn appropriate translation and then say what you are saying with confidence. I doubt you can.",

   "Plotter,\n \nOriginally Posted by plotter\n Jesus was in his 30s when he was crucified.\n \n A lot is written about his birth and the events surrounding that event, the same can be said about his death and the events leading to that event.\n \n So why hasnt anything been written about the time in between? His teens, his 20s, thats an awful long time. What did he do during those years? \n \n His birth, was Mary truly a virgin? what about Joseph, what did he have to say, did he truly believe his wife was pregnant due to a miracle.\n \n I want you all to be honest here, if your wife came home one day and said to you something like, \"darling i had a dream that im going to be the mother of gods son, im pregnant and its not yours\". \n \n What would you do? you wouldnt open the champagne would you, You would start thinking of ways to kill the man who did the dirty deed with your wife then find a good divorce lawyer.\n \n The bible has many flaws in it like these\n\n \n Why did they not write about him throughout his life? It is fairly simple. Look at John 2:4 where Jesus tells his mother that \"My hour has not yet come.\" Jesus, it seems, had a plan. He would reveal himself in due time when he was ready.\n \n The apostles and those close to the apostles who wrote about Jesus did not know him in his teenage years (at least I have never come upon anything suggesting this). Jesus went out, chose the apostles, called them to his ministry when he was about thirty. They had no reason to write about him before that. They had no reason to write about him until he gave them one of his most influential commandments \"go out and make disciples of all nations.\"\n \n Now, anyone trying to invent a story of a deity might have been concerned with filling up every detail of Christ's life. They might have attempted to portray a divine precocity and wonder-workings of youth. That is why some writings were rejected by the Church--they were not authentic and their tall tales could be distinguished from the truth. But those who wrote authentically of Jesus wrote sufficiently, they wrote what was necessary and they passed on in Tradition whatever else was needed.\n \n Jesus was calm in his divinity...no megalomania, no insanity, no power trips, yet at the same time wise beyond any contemporary, revolutionary beyond his time, singular among men, yet universal to mankind...just the opposite of what you would expect of someone making false claims. The people who wrote about him were just as calm in describing his divinity. There are no outrageous exploitations or fabulous fantasy miracles. Just the simple stuff of a divine life put into writing.\n \n (Interesting that you think the events of Alexander the Great's life were recorded with accuracy because I think the source of that information comes from writings dating about 800 years after Alexander's life. In contrast, the most liberal estimates of when the accounts of Jesus' life were written would fall between 70-100 years I believe).",

   "Richard,\n \nOriginally Posted by Richard\n This seems the appropriate space to make a Biblical defence against the false teachings of Christ. I have read a lot of these posts and it seems clear to me that there are a lot of people making their own interpretations of Christ (Mark 7:13). There are also a number of claims that the Bible in some way says that Jesus is God or God incarnate, something that the Bible refutes (John 14:28, John 20:17, Phil. 2:6).\n\n \n None of the verses you supply concerning God incarnate refute the claim. Phillipians 2:6 seems to but not when you read Paul's other writings. Collosians 2:9, \"in him dwells the whole fullness of deity  bodily.\" In human form he humbled himself to be like us and emptied himself of his divine attributes at times.\n \n Not only did Jesus claim to be God but those around him knew he was claiming to be God:\n \n John 5:18  \"he not only broke the sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God.\"\n \n When he said, \"I and the Father are one\" why did the Jews pick up stones to stone him?

   "I am sorry for your trials of life but Jesus did not guarantee that life following God would be without turmoil emotionally or otherwise. In Matthew 10:34 he says, \"Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.\" Jesus also said that we must take up our own cross and follow him.\n\n \n I think you know that Jesus was talking about external conflicts, not internal conflicts. The Holy Spirit brings inter peace, not inter conflict. But feel free to keep your beliefs and I&#8217;ll feel free to follow where the Holy Spirit lead me.\n \n \n I don't think the Church ever made a statement on that.\n\n \n The church certainly stated that the sun rotated around the earth and used the Bible to back it up.\n \n \nI don't think the Church ever apologized for a belief. As I said above, I don't think they made a statement on the earth being flat or round.\n\n \n They made the statement that the sun rotated around the earth and they were wrong about that whether they apologized for it or not. It they didn&#8217;t apologize, they should have because it was false.\n \n \n They did apologize for their handling of Galileo. Have you ever heard of Copernicus? He originated the theories that Galileo made famous. He was on very good terms with the Church. There were other issues involved in the Galileo situation.\n\n \n As they should have, although about 400 years too late for it to do Galileo any good. And yes Copernicus was on good terms with the church but he as afraid to publish his work and beliefs about the solar system till right before his death. If he had, he would not have been on very good terms with the Church as they highly criticized his work as soon as it was published.\n \n \nLet's re-examine these issues:\n \n 1. Jesus claimed to be God and those around him knew that he was claiming to be God--see my earlier posts concerning both of these issues\n\n \n No, it is written in the Bible that Jesus claimed to be God. That doesn&#8217;t prove that he claimed that.\n \n \n2. if the claims of the authors of scripture concerning Jesus' divinity were embellished or made up then we have no reason to trust that they didn't make up Jesus' teachings either\n\n \n That&#8217;s not true at all. Many times someone is written about and much of it is true. But if the person doing the writing is biased, they will exaggerate at times in order to make that person look good. And that is easy to see.\n \n \n3. there was no apostasy or abandonment of Jesus' teachings early in the Church--the Church's teachings have not changed, what is said in scripture flows with what the early Church discussed and taught&#8212;\n\n \n That you don&#8217;t know as there are no original records of what was taught in the early church. There were debates in the early church about whether Jesus was divine or not.\n \n \n4. the early Christians were not attempting to garner authority as is evidenced by their willingness to give up their earthly life and any authority they might have (not just the apostles either, many after them were martyred)\n\n \n I agree if you are talking about the very early Christians. But after that initial start when Christianity started spreading, that&#8217;s a different story. And especially after it became the state religion.",

   "when you read Paul's other writings. Collosians 2:9, \"in him dwells the whole fullness of deity bodily.\"\n\n \n When the Bible is approached with no preconcieved ideas the trinity disappears, the trinity not only nullifys the ransom price paid by christ, it causes disunity to florish in the Bible somthing that would be impossible if it was authored by Almighty God (2Tim 3:16)\n Quotes from RFTS (WBTS)\n Colossians 2:9:\n KJ reads: \"In him [Christ] dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead [Greek, the\u00b7o'te\u00b7tos] bodily.\" (A similar thought is conveyed by the renderings in NE, RS, JB, NAB, Dy.) However, NW reads: \"It is in him that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells bodily.\" (AT, We, and CKW read \"God's nature,\" instead of \"Godhead.\" Compare 2 Peter 1:4.)\n Admittedly, not everyone offers the same interpretation of Colossians 2:9. But what is in agreement with the rest of the inspired letter to the Colossians? Did Christ have in himself something that is his because he is God, part of a Trinity? Or is \"the fullness\" that dwells in him something that became his because of the decision of someone else? Colossians 1:19 (KJ, Dy) says that all fullness dwelt in Christ because it \"pleased the Father\" for this to be the case. NE says it was \"by God's own choice.\"\n Consider the immediate context of Colossians 2:9: In \u00deCol 2 \u00dcverse 8, readers are warned against being misled by those who advocate philosophy and human traditions. They are also told that in Christ \"are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge\" and are urged to \"live in him\" and to be \"rooted and built up in him and established in the faith.\" (\u00deCol 2 \u00dcVerses 3, 6, 7) It is in him, and not in the originators or the teachers of human philosophy, that a certain precious \"fulness\" dwells. Was the apostle Paul there saying that the \"fulness\" that was in Christ made Christ God himself? Not according to Colossians 3:1, where Christ is said to be \"seated at the right hand of God.\"-See KJ, Dy, TEV, NAB.\n According to Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, the\u00b7o'tes (the nominative form, from which the\u00b7o'te\u00b7tos is derived) means \"divinity, divine nature.\" (Oxford, 1968, p. 792) Being truly \"divinity,\" or of \"divine nature,\" does not make Jesus as the Son of God coequal and coeternal with the Father, any more than the fact that all humans share \"humanity\" or \"human nature\" makes them coequal or all the same age.\n \n \n\"Not only did Jesus claim to be God but those around him knew he was claiming to be God:\n \n John 5:18 \"he not only broke the sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God.\"\n \n When he said, \"I and the Father are one\" why did the Jews pick up stones to stone him? John 10: 30-31 The answer is in line 33, \"The Jews answered him, 'We stone you for no good work but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God. \n \n \n Quotes from 'RFTS' (WBTS)\n John 10:30:\n When saying, \"I and the Father are one,\" did Jesus mean that they were equal? Some Trinitarians say that he did. But at John 17:21, 22, Jesus prayed regarding his followers: \"That they may all be one,\" and he added, \"that they may be one even as we are one.\" He used the same Greek word (hen) for \"one\" in all these instances. Obviously, Jesus' disciples do not all become part of the Trinity. But they do come to share a oneness of purpose with the Father and the Son, the same sort of oneness that unites God and Christ.\n \n \"I and the Father Are One\"\n THAT text, at John 10:30, is often cited to support the Trinity, even though no third person is mentioned there. But Jesus himself showed what he meant by his being \"one\" with the Father. At John 17:21, 22, he prayed to God that his disciples \"may all be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us, . . . that they may be one just as we are one.\" Was Jesus praying that all his disciples would become a single entity? No, obviously Jesus was praying that they would be united in thought and purpose, as he and God were.-See also 1 Corinthians 1:10.\n At 1 Corinthians 3:6, 8, Paul says: \"I planted, Apollos watered . . . He that plants and he that waters are one.\" Paul did not mean that he and Apollos were two persons in one; he meant that they were unified in purpose. The Greek word that Paul used here for \"one\" (hen) is neuter, literally \"one (thing),\" indicating oneness in cooperation. It is the same word that Jesus used at John 10:30 to describe his relationship with his Father. It is also the same word that Jesus used at John 17:21, 22. So when he used the word \"one\" (hen) in these cases, he was talking about unity of thought and purpose.\n Regarding John 10:30, John Calvin (who was a Trinitarian) said in the book Commentary on the Gospel According to John: \"The ancients made a wrong use of this passage to prove that Christ is . . . of the same essence with the Father. For Christ does not argue about the unity of substance, but about the agreement which he has with the Father.\"\n Right in the context of the verses after John 10:30, Jesus forcefully argued that his words were not a claim to be God. He asked the Jews who wrongly drew that conclusion and wanted to stone him: \"Why do you charge me with blasphemy because I, consecrated and sent into the world by the Father, said, 'I am God's son'?\" (John 10:31-36, NE) No, Jesus claimed that he was, not God the Son, but the Son of God.\n \"Making Himself Equal to God\"?\n ANOTHER scripture offered as support for the Trinity is John 5:18. It says that the Jews (as at John 10:31-36) wanted to kill Jesus because \"he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God.\"\n But who said that Jesus was making himself equal to God? Not Jesus. He defended himself against this false charge in the very next verse (\u00deJoh 5:\u00dc19): \"To this accusation Jesus replied: . . . 'the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees the Father doing.'\"-JB.\n By this, Jesus showed the Jews that he was not equal to God and therefore could not act on his own initiative. Can we imagine someone equal to Almighty God saying that he could \"do nothing by himself\"? (Compare Daniel 4:34, 35.) Interestingly, the context of both John 5:18 and \u00deJoh \u00dc10:30 shows that Jesus defended himself against false charges from Jews who, like the Trinitarians, were drawing wrong conclusions!\n \n \nWhy did the Jews want him crucified? John 19:7\n\n \n Because, like Jehovah's people on earth today he directly opposed the false teachings and traditional ties of the establishment (Mark 7:13), this would, in effect remove their power over the people.",

   "There is a huge study possible on this subject, but in brief, Colossians 1:15 says that Christ was the &#8220;firstborn of all creation&#8221; the first and only creation to be made directly by Jehovah, thereafter Jesus was used by Jehovah as his &#8220;Master Worker&#8221; (Pro. 8:30,) to create all &#8220;other things&#8221;(Coll.15:16), so then who would be in a better position to know the ins&#8217; and outs&#8217; of mankind in their caged condition? Since God can&#8217;t come to earth (Ex. 33:20) he sent the next best thing, his &#8220;firstborn&#8221; All of this was foreshadowed in the scriptures by Abraham and Isaac (Gen. 22: 9), important to point out that they weren&#8217;t one entity either. \n\n \n Richard since I do not believe the Bible is the word of God, I do not believe your teachings.

   "Hank,\n \nI think you know that Jesus was talking about external conflicts, not internal conflicts.\n \n I think he was talking about both. After saying that he had come to bring a sword, he explains by saying that he would set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother...I doubt that would simply be an external conflict without any internal aspects.\n \n \nThe Holy Spirit brings inter peace, not inter conflict.\n \n Amen.\n \n \nBut feel free to keep your beliefs and I'll feel free to follow where the Holy Spirit lead me.\n\n I appreciate your sincere search and your faithfulness. But soliciting the spirit cannot stand alone. History and truth must be incorporated into it.\n \n \nThey made the statement that the sun rotated around the earth and they were wrong about that whether they apologized for it or not. It they didn't apologize, they should have because it was false.\n\n If  they did make the statement then why should they apologize? Do you require an apology for every scientist that proposes an incorrect theory? Have you been campaigning for a posthumous apology from Galileo's family due to his theory (or should I say his expansion of Copernicus' and Kepler's theory) being wrong? You do know that his theory was wrong don't you? He proposed the sun as the fixed center of the universe. We now know that the sun is not fixed and it is not the center of the universe but of the solar system. \n \n \nAs they should have, although about 400 years too late for it to do Galileo any good. And yes Copernicus was on good terms with the church but he as afraid to publish his work and beliefs about the solar system till right before his death. If he had, he would not have been on very good terms with the Church as they highly criticized his work as soon as it was published.\n\n On the contrary the Church encouraged Copernicus and protected him:\n \n \"His great work, \"De Revolutionibus orblure coelestium\", was published at the earnest solicitation of two distinguished churchmen, Cardinal Sch\u00f6mberg and Tiedemann Giese, Bishop of Culm. It was dedicated by permission to Pope Paul III in order, as Copernicus explained, that it might be thus protected from the attacks which it was sure to encounter on the part of the \"mathematicians\" (i.e. philosophers) for its apparent contradiction of the evidence of our senses, and even of common sense. He added that he made no account of objections which might be brought by ignorant wiseacres on Scriptural grounds. Indeed, for nearly three quarters of a century no such difficulties were raised on the Catholic side, although Luther and Melanchthon condemned the work of Copernicus in unmeasured terms. Neither Paul III, nor any of the nine popes who followed him, nor the Roman Congregations raised any alarm, and, as has been seen, and, as has been seen, Galileo himself in 1597, speaking of the risks he might run by an advocacy of Copernicanism, mentioned ridicule only and said nothing of persecution.\"\n (www.newadvent.org, emphasis mine)\n \n \nNo, it is written in the Bible that Jesus claimed to be God. That doesn't prove that he claimed that.\n\n Yes, the Bible and 2,000 years of teaching and belief of Christians. I'm not using time as a proof. But I will say that the odds are more in favor of the traditional view than a view you have come up with within the last however many years you have been on earth. A view gained through solicitation with the \"holy spirit\" that has revealed to you something different than he has revealed the millions of other Christians out there since the beginning of the concept of God as Father through Christ's teachings.\n \n \nThat's not true at all. Many times someone is written about and much of it is true. But if the person doing the writing is biased, they will exaggerate at times in order to make that person look good. And that is easy to see.\"\n\n But I have already addressed the fact that if the writers of sacred scripture were creating godhood in Jesus then they would have done it in much more dramatic fashion. It would have looked a lot more like a tall tale than a biography, a history, or an account.\n \n \nThat you don't know as there are no original records of what was taught in the early church. There were debates in the early church about whether Jesus was divine or not.\n \n There were not debates whether Jesus was God in the Church. There might have been debate between the Church and heretics. Do you have original records of these debates to prove their authenticity?\n \n \nI agree if you are talking about the very early Christians. But after that initial start when Christianity started spreading, that's a different story. And especially after it became the state religion.\n\n I believe you proposed that a thirst for authority was one of the reasons the Church added parts to the bible establishing Christ's divinity. Now you acknowledge that this did not happen in early Christendom but later when it became the state religion. The problem with this is that the divinity of Christ was established in the Church a long time before it became the state religion, it did not become the state religion until the 300s (Edict of Milan 313).",

   "To all.\n Questions posed by Hank,\n 1.God created a ?lesser god? as his first creation a long time ago.\n Coll. 1:15 \n\n \n Look on a bit further...\n Colossians 1:19\n \"For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him\"\n \n That is, He (Jesus) contains everything that is God (the Father). They are equal. They are equal because they are of the same substance, and are the same essence. They are the same being.\n \n Thus...\n I John 5:7 \"There are those that bear record in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one\"\n \n \n2. God then created the angels.\n Yes through his ?master worker? Jesus (Pro. 8:30) \n\n \n In fact, it is an allegorical embodiment of \"Wisdom\", it is 'wisdom' who is speaking. \n Pro 8:12\n \"I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion. \"\n \n It is suggesting that God, all the time He worked, worked with Wisdom. It is the writer of this book giving voice that wisdom worked with God, and visa versa.\n \n You must know that Psalms, Proverbs and some others are not literal books. They are songs of praise and allegorical prophecy. Hence at Psalm 103 \"The sun knoweth his going down\" does not mean that the sun has literal understanding. Do not confuse these books.\n \n The truly odd thing is you believe here \"Wisdom\" is a personal force, but you JWs deny the Holy Spirit is - yet look at Ephesians 4:\n 30 \"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.\" The Holy Spirit has emotions - because the Holy Spirit is a personage of the Trinity.\n \n \n3. Satan as the leader of some of the angels rebelled and were cast out of heaven. (into hell or earth or what?)\n Cast out of heaven yes -Rev 12:9- this same verse answers as to his destination, also notice his goal. However this was not at the beginning of his rebellion, Job 1:6 says he was still in heaven, but why? He raised some very important questions that in themselves were not worthy of immediate destruction, but WERE worthy of full and fair answer. Satan questioned Jehovah?s sovereignty (Gen 3:1-5), his right to rule mankind, in fact his right to rule PERIOD, Jesus taught in his model prayer that this is the most important thing to pray for to achieve universal peace (Matt. 6:9). Both you and I are living right at the end (2Tim 3:1 onwards) of the allowed period given by Jehovah to prove this false claim. \n\n \n Why do you use the name \"Jehovah?\"\n \n It is interesting you refer to Revelations. JWs don't believe in hell...But, according to Scripture, if one is in hell, \"he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur . . . the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever, and day and night they have no rest\" (Rev. 14:11). This is an \"everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels\" (Matt. 25:41). Jesus tells his listeners of Lazarus and the rich man, where the rich man dies, and is \"existing in torment . . . he sees . . . calls out . . . ?I am in anguish in this blazing fire?\" (Luke 16:19-31). As a further illustration, Jesus stated that hell is likened to Gehenna. This \"Valley of Hinnom\" was located southeast of Jerusalem, and was used as a garbage dump where trash and waste were continuously burned day and night in a large fire. Jesus informs the listeners that hell is like this, \"where the maggot does not die, and fire is not put out\" (Mark 9:42-48). It is the place where the wicked are sent, and from this \"everlasting fire\" (Matt. 18:8) will come \"weeping and the gnashing of teeth\" (Matt. 8:12). Now if hell were \"a place of rest in hope\" as the WTS teaches, then it is odd that Jesus would choose such contradictory illustrations to convey this. Lastly, Revelation 20 calls hell a \"pool of fire . . . [where] they will be tormented day and night, forever and ever\"?all who are not in the book of life. So, if one?s name is in the book of life, one enters heaven (Rev. 21:27). If it not in the book, then a literal hell awaits. \n \n So you believe a single passage of Revelations is literal, but not others from the same book.\n \n What valid questions did Satan raise? Do you think Satan therefore was justified in his rebellion?\n \n Job 1: 7 The LORD said to Satan, \"Where have you come from?\" \n Satan answered the LORD , \"From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it.\" \n \n Does the Lord know everything? If so, why did he ask Satan? (which here is often translated as 'accuser')\n \n \n4. God created the earth. (in 6 literal days or long period of time?)\n Evidence would seem to suggest that this earth is older than 6,000 years. A ?day? in the Bible simply implies a period of time, e.g. ?in Kennedy?s day?. \n\n \n First off you're confusing two issues. Genesis says the world was created in six days. That's not saying that it's six thousand years old.\n \n Secondly, if you look at the order of creation, it's impossible to draw inference that God was slowly working up His creation - that is, building it bit by bit from less complex to more complex, as it is created out of any sense of order, that is, it doesn't follow any sense of science.\n \n This is to show you that the time of creation was unlike all others. Thus the first life created is grass and trees, not life in the seas.\n \n Worlds are created before day and night etc. It doesn't make sense in any scientific way, so trying to rationalise it is odd.\n \n St Ephraim the Syrian says\n \"No one should think that the Creation of Six Days is an allegory; it is likewise impermissible to say that what seems, according to the account, to have been created in six days, was created in a single instant, and likewise that certain names presented in this account either signify nothing, or signify something else. On the contrary, we must know that just as the heaven and the earth which were created in the beginning are actually the heaven and earth and not something else understood under the names of heaven and earth, so also everything else that is spoken of as being created and brought into order after the creation of heaven and earth is not empty names, but the very essence of the created natures corresponds to the forces of these names.\"\n quoted in Fr. Seraphim Rose \"Genesis, Creation and Early Man: The Orthodox Christian Vision\", p86\n \n \n5. Adam sinned.\n Perfectly \n\n \n True.\n \n \n6. God promised a redeemer.\n Gen. 3:15. \n\n \n True.\n \n \n7. God implanted the ?lesser god? into the person we call Jesus.\n Matt. 1:18. \n\n \n No. It says \"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit\"\n \n There's no inference of a lesser god here at all. The full personage of Jesus, God and human, was conceived by Mary and the Holy Spirit.\n \n \n \n8. Jesus died as a sacrifice for the sins of Adam and through Adam all of mankind. 1Cor 15:45 I?ll let you guess who the verse is referring to.\n Is that the basics?\n Almost!\n Is Satan a god as Paul says in ?god of this world? or is that a wrong interpretation?\n Satan owns this world, and every thing in it. Reason on Matt. 4:8-9.\n This is the briefest I can make it, HUGE elaboration possible.\n p.s. we are all ministers of God. \n\n \n Mat 4:8-9\n They were not his (Satan's) to give. God, through the second person of Jesus created the world. Not Satan. Where did Satan wrest control of the earth from God? Earlier you said that Satan questioned God's sovereignty - not take it from Him.\n \n PS what do you mean we are all ministers of God? Why have you ignored Acts of the Apostles? Go read Acts; bishops were created, so were deacons. Bishops held the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Deacons and others could baptise, but the Holy Spirit was conferred through the Bishops.\n Thus Philip the Deacon (Acts 8) went to Samaria (Acts 8:5-8) to preach. Many believed and were baptised (Acts 8:12). The Apostles came later and confirmed these new believers with the gifts of the Holy Spirit through he laying on of hands (Acts 8:14-17)\n \n Later the Apostle Paul met some disciples of John the Baptist who had not been present when Peter spoke at Pentecost (Acts 19:1-7). They believed in Christ \"were baptised\" (Acts 19:5) and the Holy Spirit came upon them (Acts 19:6) again through the hands of an Apostle.\n \n It was not enough that they had faith, and that they believed! Jesus commissioned his Apostles to act in His name. He told them that the Church they founded would prevail. He established His church (fulfilling Mat 16:18)\n \n Right from Pentecost, when the Orthodox Church was founded, the people look to the Apostles for guidance. \"What shall we do?\" (Acts 2:37) they ask - even after they've received the Holy Spirit !\n \n Paul's epistles also talk about one church, and he continually calls on people back to this church. He never says \"Okay, you've got the Holy Spirit, now go and do your own thing... it's all valid, so long as you have faith\"",

   "Montalban,\n Thankyou for such a well thought out and presented case, there are alot of points of contention there so I think it would be wise to take one point at a time. its your case, so its your choice.\n\n \n Jesus is part of the Trinity. I've stated passges in the previous post, here's some more thoughts...\n \n Hebrews 13: 8\n Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. \n 9\n Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines. For it is good that the heart be established by grace, not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied with them\n \n JWs believe that the doctrine of the Nicence Creed is the work of Satan. How is it inconsistant with Biblical teachings? How is it that the church that put the Bible together, adoped the Nicece Creed before the Bible? In other words, how did it become evil, for the Nicence Creed, then revert to being good, to compile the Bible, then revert to being evil?",

   "To All\n Montalban,\n At this point I would again like to make it perfectly clear that Jehovah's Witnesses never attack anyone on a personal level, however the teachings of the establishment (not 1st century Christians) can and will be brought in to question by us.\n My apologies that this is such as huge post, but it is after all a huge question. Please take time to read it and ponder on it.\n Quotes by Watchtower magazine 1969. (WBTS)\n Development of Trinity in the Creeds\n PROBABLY most churchgoers today believe that Jesus Christ and his apostles developed the doctrine of the Trinity. However, Professor E. Washburn Hopkins explains in his book Origin and Evolution of Religion, page 336: \"To Jesus and Paul the doctrine of the trinity was apparently unknown; at any rate, they say nothing about it.\" They formulated no creed defining a Trinity.\n The fact is, the word \"trinity\" does not even once occur in the Holy Bible. Nor are such expressions as \"one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit,\" or \"one substance with the Father,\" found in the Bible. To the contrary, the Bible speaks of Christ as \"the beginning of the creation by God,\" and says that \"the head of the Christ is God.\" (Rev. 3:14; 1 Cor. 11:3) Thus, the New Catholic Encyclopedia says of the Trinity: \"It is not, as already seen, directly and immediately the word of God.\"-Volume 14, page 304.\n UNKNOWN TO EARLY CHURCHMEN\n Nor was the 'three persons in one God' concept developed immediately after the death of Jesus and his apostles. This is noted by Episcopal professor of church history James Arthur Muller, who writes: \"This lack of a formulated doctrine of the Trinity reflects the theological thought of the second century. In the works of Justin Martyr, who wrote in about 150 A.D., the preexistence of the Son is stressed, yet in relation to the Father He is spoken of as 'in the second place.'\"-Creeds and Loyalty, page 9.\n Even toward the end of the second century the prominent churchman Irenaeus spoke of Christ as being subordinate to God, not equal to him.-See Irenaeus Against Heresies, Book 2, chapter 28, section 8.\n Thus the Trinity was unknown to early churchmen. Actually it was some 400 years or more after the death of Christ that the concept of 'three persons in one God' was finally formulated by men and introduced into the church.\n THE APOSTLES' CREED\n \"But,\" someone may object, \"did not the apostles themselves compose the Apostles' Creed? And does not this creed teach the Trinity?\"\n That the twelve apostles wrote this creed was taught for centuries, and it was piously believed. But this claim has been proved untrue. Actually, the evidence reveals that the \"Apostles' Creed\" was framed by men living hundreds of years later!\n The Faith of Christendom, a source book of creeds and confessions, edited by B. A. Gerrish, observes: \"So far, then, from being composed by the Apostles in person, we have no reason to assume that the Creed which bears their title appeared less than five hundred years after their time.\" Examine the Apostles' Creed set forth below:\n \"I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost; born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into hell; the third day he rose from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen.\"\n You can see that nothing is said here about God, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost as being \"one God.\" However, during the years in which the Apostles' Creed was being formulated great controversy developed over the nature of Christ. What exactly was his relationship to God? Was he lesser than and distinct from God, or was Jesus God himself?\n THE NICENE CREED\n By the fourth century some churchmen, including the young archdeacon Athanasius, were arguing that Jesus and God were one and the same person. On the other hand, men such as the presbyter Arius held to the position of the Bible, that Jesus was created by God and was subordinate to his Father. In 325 C.E. a church council, called by Roman Emperor Constantine, met in Nice, Asia Minor, to decide on such issues. At this council pagan Emperor Constantine favored the side of Athanasius. Therefore, the views expressed by Arius, although based solidly on the Bible, were declared heretical.\n Hence there followed an 'experimenting with words and sharpening of phrases' to design a creedal tool to use against those who held that Christ had a beginning and was not the same substance as the Father. In its original form, the Nicene Creed was clearly designed to combat the position of Arius. It concluded with this pronouncement, which was later dropped from the creed:\n \"But those who say there was a time when he was not; or that he was not before he was begotten; or that he was made from that which had no being; or who affirm the Son of God to be of any other substance or essence, or created, or variable, or mutable, such persons doth the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematize [curse].\"\n Noteworthy, too, is the fact that the original creed drawn up at Nice did not give personality to the Holy Ghost. However, later additions, believed to have been made at the Council of Constantinople in 381 C.E., did. The creed drawn up at Nice in 325 C.E., with its later alterations, passed into history as the Nicene Creed. It reads as follows:\n \"I believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible: And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of his Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by whom all things were made; Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, he suffered and was buried; and the third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father. And he shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceedeth from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spake by the prophets. And I believe one catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.\"\n After carefully reading the Nicene Creed, it is interesting to note that in it the Trinity is not yet completely defined. The Father and Son are asserted to be of the same substance, and the Holy Ghost is called \"Lord and Giver of Life,\" but these three are not said to be \"one God.\" There was to be yet further 'experimenting with words and sharpening of phrases.'\n THE ATHANASIAN CREED\n It is in the Athanasian Creed that the Trinity was finally defined. As you recall, Athanasius was the young archdeacon who prominently supported the views set forth in the Nicene Creed. Did he also compose this creed bearing his name?\n This is what was believed for centuries, but this has definitely been proved untrue. The Faith of Christendom observes on page 61: \"The attribution of the Creed to Athanasius was exposed in the seventeenth century by the Dutch scholar G. J. Voss. It has been argued on internal evidence that the document may be dated to the period between A.D. 381 and 428.\"\n However, there is no certain evidence for such an early date for the creed. In fact, there is no reference to it in completed form until hundreds of years later! Thus, John J. Moment, in his book on the creeds, states flatly: \"Athanasius had been dead for five hundred years when it appeared.\" (We Believe, page 118) Observe how the Athanasian Creed defines the Trinity:\n \" . . . we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one: the glory equal, the majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet they are not three eternals, but one eternal. As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated, but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible.\n \"So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Ghost almighty. And yet there are not three almightys, but one almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet there are not three Gods, but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not three Lords, but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every person by himself to be God and Lord, so are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say there be three Gods and three Lords.\n \"The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is afore or after other; none is greater or less than another. But the whole three persons are coeternal together, and coequal. So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped. He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity. . . . \"\n So, many hundreds of years after the death of Jesus Christ, the Trinity doctrine was finally formulated. Men had, in the words of theologian N. Leroy Norquist, \"experimented with words, sharpened phrases, until they had defined the relation of the three 'persons' of the Trinity in such a way that they could finally say, 'Unless you believe this you're not a true believer.'\"\n In this way, therefore, the concept of God now held in most churches was formularized.\n \n AN UNSCRIPTURAL CONCEPT\n God's Word, however, is in direct opposition to this 'three persons in one God' concept. The Bible says that God is the \"King of eternity,\" and is without beginning or end. (1 Tim. 1:17; Ps. 90:2) But the Bible says that, unlike his eternal Father, Jesus is \"the beginning of the creation by God.\" (Rev. 3:14) Further proof that Jesus and God are not one and the same or equal is seen in the fact that upon Jesus' resurrection from the dead, \"God exalted him to a superior position.\" (Phil. 2:9) If, before his exaltation, Jesus had been equal to God, he could not have been exalted any further, for that would have made him superior to God. How evident that the Trinity doctrine was not taught by the first-century Christians!\n The Bible teaching is clear. Jehovah is the Almighty God who \"created all things.\" (Rev. 4:11) Jesus Christ is \"God's Son,\" not Almighty God himself. (Luke 1:35) And the holy spirit is not a person but is God's active force with which persons can be filled. (Acts 2:4) Since the churches obviously have not been teaching these Bible truths, it is vital, if you desire to please your Creator, to separate completely from such religious organizations.-Rev. 18:4.\n Jehovah is in truth God. He is the living God and the King to time indefinite.-Jer. 10:10. \n \n Please can you answer me a question from the Bible: Did God prophesy concerning the 'Christian' establishment that it would remain unchanged down through the centuries. Also compare Isaiah 2:2.\n \n With love.",

   "I think he was talking about both. After saying that he had come to bring a sword, he explains by saying that he would set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother...I doubt that would simply be an external conflict without any internal aspects.\n\n \n Once you give up everything for God, everything else becomes irrelevant, even family. That&#8217;s a choice you make and it beings internal peace, not conflict. \n \n \n Amen.\n\n \n That&#8217;s how I know the message was from the Holy Spirit. Because of the peace it brought in my life.\n \n \n I appreciate your sincere search and your faithfulness. But soliciting the spirit cannot stand alone. History and truth must be incorporated into it.\n\n \n The Holy Spirit IS the truth. \n \n \n If they did make the statement then why should they apologize? Do you require an apology for every scientist that proposes an incorrect theory? Have you been campaigning for a posthumous apology from Galileo's family due to his theory (or should I say his expansion of Copernicus' and Kepler's theory) being wrong? You do know that his theory was wrong don't you? He proposed the sun as the fixed center of the universe. We now know that the sun is not fixed and it is not the center of the universe but of the solar system. \n\n \n I don&#8217;t require anything. But justice does. If it was just a matter of having false beliefs, that is something that often happens. But forcing those beliefs on others or denying others to hold to different beliefs under threat of imprisonment or torture is wrong. You can defend the treatment of Galileo by the church or other parts of the inquisition if you chose. But according to most people&#8217;s values in today&#8217;s time, it was just plain wrong.\n \n In 1992, John Paul proclaimed that the Vatican had erred when it condemned Galileo.\n \n \nOn the contrary the Church encouraged Copernicus and protected him:\n \n \"His great work, \"De Revolutionibus orblure coelestium\", was published at the earnest solicitation of two distinguished churchmen, Cardinal Sch\u00f6mberg and Tiedemann Giese, Bishop of Culm. It was dedicated by permission to Pope Paul III in order, as Copernicus explained, that it might be thus protected from the attacks which it was sure to encounter on the part of the \"mathematicians\" (i.e. philosophers) for its apparent contradiction of the evidence of our senses, and even of common sense. He added that he made no account of objections which might be brought by ignorant wiseacres on Scriptural grounds. Indeed, for nearly three quarters of a century no such difficulties were raised on the Catholic side, although Luther and Melanchthon condemned the work of Copernicus in unmeasured terms. Neither Paul III, nor any of the nine popes who followed him, nor the Roman Congregations raised any alarm, and, as has been seen, and, as has been seen, Galileo himself in 1597, speaking of the risks he might run by an advocacy of Copernicanism, mentioned ridicule only and said nothing of persecution.\"\n (www.newadvent.org, emphasis mine)\n\n \n It was banned by the church until 1822. \n \n \n Yes, the Bible and 2,000 years of teaching and belief of Christians. I'm not using time as a proof. But I will say that the odds are more in favor of the traditional view than a view you have come up with within the last however many years you have been on earth. A view gained through solicitation with the \"holy spirit\" that has revealed to you something different than he has revealed the millions of other Christians out there since the beginning of the concept of God as Father through Christ's teachings.\n\n \n I think there are many others that have come to the same revelation as I have. But whether they have or not, the truth is not a popularity contest. This is the same argument the Pharisees used against Jesus. That they knew more about God than he did because they had been in the business longer and there were many more of them that believe that way.\n \n \nBut I have already addressed the fact that if the writers of sacred scripture were creating godhood in Jesus then they would have done it in much more dramatic fashion. It would have looked a lot more like a tall tale than a biography, a history, or an account.\n\n \n Because you have already addressed it does not make it a fact as you say. A changed word here or there can make a huge difference in the meaning of a passage. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a tall tale. \n \n \nThere were not debates whether Jesus was God in the Church. There might have been debate between the Church and heretics. Do you have original records of these debates to prove their authenticity?\n\n \n I have read books and publications regarding these debates. However I understand that the winners of these debates would be considered the official teachings of the church so in that sense there can be no argument. The winners write the history. That doesn&#8217;t mean there were not debates.\n \n The long post by Richard makes a very good argument on how the church developed the belief of the trinity. \n \n \n I believe you proposed that a thirst for authority was one of the reasons the Church added parts to the bible establishing Christ's divinity. Now you acknowledge that this did not happen in early Christendom but later when it became the state religion. The problem with this is that the divinity of Christ was established in the Church a long time before it became the state religion, it did not become the state religion until the 300s (Edict of Milan 313). \n\n \n It would be nice if this did not turn into a &#8216;trying to catch someone in a mistake&#8217; type debate. I could easily say in your first two sentences that you state that Jesus taught there would be internal conflict and then acknowledge the Holy Spirit brings internal peace. But I am merely trying to discuss the subject. That being said, I have tried to make it quite clear that I admired the early followers of Jesus for their dedication and sacrifices for their beliefs. My reference to early was around the first century. There was a hundred and fifty years or so where we do not have original manuscripts where anything could have been edited or changed in the manuscripts. And during that time the church was spreading, developing its beliefs, and developing into a civil power. That&#8217;s what I was referring to.",

They formulated no creed defining a Trinity.\n The fact is, the word ?trinity? does not even once occur in the Holy Bible. Nor are such expressions as ?one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit,? or ?one substance with the Father,? found in the Bible. To the contrary, the Bible speaks of Christ as ?the beginning of the creation by God,? and says that ?the head of the Christ is God.? (Rev. 3:14; 1 Cor. 11:3) Thus, the New Catholic Encyclopaedia says of the Trinity: ?It is not, as already seen, directly and immediately the word of God.??Volume 14, page 304.\n\n \n They did not 'develop' the doctrine of the Trinity. The Trinity is truth. One does not 'develop' truth. Therefore no Christian should believe that which you say about Jesus Christ and His Apostles.\n \n Indeed the word Trinity does not appear. Note this. Church councils only came together to pronounce dogma in specific instances to rebut attacks made by heretics. The idea of a Trinity was always there. Hence my earlier passage about God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit being one. Thus the Nicene Creed was drawn up specifically to answer Arianism.\n \n This is still the way of the Orthodox Church in that we don't jump to making dogmas. This is because of the weakness of the human way of expressing, St. Gregory the Theologian stresses the phrase: ?It is impossible to express God, and yet more impossible to conceive Him. However, when pushed by heresy, we have defined dogma to make perfectly clear, where we stand.\n \n The doctrine was always there. You must note that the Nicene Creed was drawn up BEFORE the Bible was compiled. If there was any misunderstanding about the Trinity, it was not apparent to those there present. Why for then did they compile a Bible which would (according to you) be in contradiction to what they had already stated? They weren't a loggerheads with the Bible, because the Bible expresses the Trinity... even though it does not use the word (it also doesn't use the word 'pulpit' as used by some churches or 'assembly hall' as used by yours).\n \n They are one\n I John 5:7 \"There are those that bear record in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one\"\n \n They are equal\n Colossians 1:19\n \"For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him\"\n \n Do things in their name...\n \"go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\" (Matthew 28:18)\n \n St. John's testimony is yet more explicit than that of the Synoptists. He expressly asserts that the very purpose of his Gospel is to establish the Divinity of Jesus Christ (John 20:31). In the prologue he identifies Him with the Word, the only-begotten of the Father, Who from all eternity exists with God, Who is God (John 1:1-18). The immanence of the Son in the Father and of the Father in the Son is declared in Christ's words to St. Philip: \"Do you not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?\" (14:10), and in other passages no less explicit (14:7; 16:15; 17:21). The oneness of Their power and Their action is affirmed: \"Whatever he [the Father] does, the Son also does in like manner\" (5:19, cf. 10:38); and to the Son no less than to the Father belongs the Divine attribute of conferring life on whom He will (5:21). In 10:29, Christ expressly teaches His unity of essence with the Father: \"That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all . . . I and the Father are one.\" The words, \"That which my Father hath given me,\" can, having regard to the context, have no other meaning than the Divine Name, possessed in its fullness by the Son as by the Father. (quoted from www.Newadvent.com)\n \n Finally, before Caiphas He not merely declares Himself to be the Messias, but in reply to a second and distinct question affirms His claim to be the Son of God. He is instantly declared by the high priest to be guilty of blasphemy, an offence which could not have been attached to the claim to be simply the Messias (Luke 22:66-71).\n \n There is indirect evidence too...\n In the parable of the wicked husbandmen, He describes Himself as the son of the householder, while the Prophets, one and all, are represented as the servants (Matthew 21:33 sqq.). That is, Jesus is the Son, allegorically directly of the flesh of the Father.\n \n Note too, that the works of individual Holy Fathers are not of themselves authoritative to the Orthodox Church, but the beliefs encapsulated at the Councils is. We acknowledge even the Holy Fathers sometimes erred, thus Augustine later repudiated some of his earlier works.\n \n Further, there is no mention of the Watchtower Society in the Bible.\n \n Also, Jesus developed no creed regarding not eating pork. We eat pork because of what the Apostles decided.\n \n \nUNKNOWN TO EARLY CHURCHMEN\n Nor was the ?three persons in one God? concept developed immediately after the death of Jesus and his apostles. This is noted by Episcopal professor of church history James Arthur Muller, who writes: ?This lack of a formulated doctrine of the Trinity reflects the theological thought of the second century. In the works of Justin Martyr, who wrote in about 150 A.D., the pre-existence of the Son is stressed, yet in relation to the Father He is spoken of as ?in the second place.???Creeds and Loyalty, page 9.\n Even toward the end of the second century the prominent churchman Irenaeus spoke of Christ as being subordinate to God, not equal to him.?See Irenaeus Against Heresies, Book 2, chapter 28, section 8.\n Thus the Trinity was unknown to early churchmen. Actually it was some 400 years or more after the death of Christ that the concept of ?three persons in one God? was finally formulated by men and introduced into the church.\n\n \n You made the statement \"UNKNOWN TO EARLY CHURCHMEN\" Certainly this is false. Theophilus of Antioch wrote on the Trinity (180AD).He speaks of \"the Trinity of God [the Father], His Word and His Wisdom (\"Ad. Autol.\", II, 15). This is still two hundred years before the compilation of the Bible, and thus fits into 'early church'.\n \n Justin Martyr is quite correct. We have always referred to Jesus as the Second person of the Trinity. God the Father, Jesus the Son, the Holy Spirit, in that order. This is because God referred to Himself as Father, and Jesus as Son. This denotes no gender to God, but it is the way He chose to call Himself so that we might better understand Him.\n \n Your discussion on Irenaeus is a half-truth. If you read further, he says that God the Father is in Fellowship with God the Son...and more specifically in response to your allegation he says...\n \"while we seek to investigate the sublime nature of the Father, fall into the danger of starting the question whether there is another God above God\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/irenaeus-book2.html\n That is, that the notion of a God above God is a nonsense. There is not a true hierarchy of gods as you would assert, Jesus is God different from God.\n \n Clement wrote of Jesus' speaking\n \"16. For Christ is with them that are lowly of mind, not with them that exalt themselves over the flock. The sceptre [of the majesty] of God, even our Lord Jesus Christ, came not in the pomp of arrogance or of pride, though He might have done so, but in lowliness of mind, according as the Holy Spirit spake concerning Him. For He saith; Lord, who believed  our  report? and to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?  We  announced Him in His presence. \"\n That is, the Report of Jesus, and of God is said to be 'our' report. Not 'your' report.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/lightfoot/pt1vol2/translation1.html\n Note, this was written c80-140 AD. Very early stuff, which not only predates the compilation of the Bible, but some of the books of the Bible as well.\n \n The Trinity is implicitly echoed in the writings of Ignatius (c.105-115 AD) in the way the church is structured...\n \"The episkopoi?s immediate subordinates were the `presbyteroi? and the `diakonoi? who together with him constituted the higher Kleroi, a trinity if you will: the Father (episkopos), Son (diakonos) and spirit-filled apostolic council (presbyteroi)\"\n http://www.thecosmiccontext.de/christianity/Ignatius1.html\n More explicitly it is his writings in his Epistle to the Magnesians\n \"CHAPTER 7\n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-magnesians-lightfoot.html\n \n Note well what he said in his Epistle to the Smyrnaeans\n \" 6:2 But mark ye those who hold strange doctrine touching the grace of Jesus Christ which came to us, how that they are contrary to the mind of God.\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-smyrnaeans-lightfoot.html\n \n \n I have, for the sake of brevity, left the discussion at this point rather than address your other concerns. emoticon_love",

   "EF i am discussing the same question, i am asking who is jesus.\n \n Briefly let me explain my take on this thread, i see jesus as a man who chose to challenge the powers and the teachings of the time, he questioned the powers and rulers of the time, and he was killed for his challenge.\n \n This was seen as a heroic act and became a legend, his followers or his admirers, created a myth surrounding his life for there own benefit, i think it was them who started christianity not jesus.\n \n These same people then created the myths that surround his life, he was turned into something he was not, a god, because any attempt to say or prove he was god, or a god, contradicts his whole life and opens this debate to questions and doubts as to whether he was real or not.\n \n However i believe he existed, but the facts he is portrayed as a god contradicts the bible and his message.\n \n Is there any sense in what im saying?\n\n \n Sorry I am so many posts behind. I see what you are saying now. However, consider the deaths of the many apostles and disciples. If you were in the place of Peter or Paul would you die for this myth that you created. Peter was crucified upside down. Paul was beheaded, Steven was stoned, John was in exile on Patmos, and so on. The apostles in the gospel are written to show themselves to be total cowards prior to their recieving the Holy Spirit at pentacost. When Jesus was arrested they all ran away. Peter denied Him three times, John ran away naked. If I were the writer of a piece of fiction to describe my \"myth\" I think I would have embellished it a bit more. The book of Mark was written under Peter. Peter is portrayed very poorly in many occasions. At one Point Jesus says to him \"On this rock I will build my church\" and then minutes later He says \"Get behind me Satan\". \n \n The disciples are pictured as weak, without faith, argumentative, and always putting themselves first. John and Peter were called the sons of thunder for their loudness and unpredictability. You are saying that these proven Cowards went on to develop a myth and then died to preserve it and suffer under great persecution prior to their deaths. Paul traveled a great deal and was shipwrecked twice. He suffered imprisonment (which is drastically different than here. Prisoners had no rights. Their food had to be brought to them by friends or relatives or they starve to death), beatings, humiliation, being run out of town and beaten and left for dead. These men did all this because of something they conspired together to produce?!\n \n People don't conspire to increase their persecution, they do the opposite. What you say just doesn't make sense. (at least in that respect. I do understand you though.) I have heard this so many times. \n \n You ask good questions, but you ask for meat and have yet been weened on milk. Try to understand the basics before you try to go to deep.",

   "To All,\n Montalban,\n \nThus in defending my beliefs I am in that sense, attacking yours. I do so, I hope with love and understanding, and also, that this is not at a personal level...\n\n \n So then there is born a mutual understanding between us both. Thank you. May a full and fair discussion of the facts ensue.\n \n \nThey did not 'develop' the doctrine of the Trinity. The Trinity is truth. One does not 'develop' truth. Therefore no Christian should believe that which you say about Jesus Christ and His Apostles.\n\n \n Firstly, and I hope you will agree that it is the word of God that is truth (John 17:17) and which is to be held in an absolute authority over ANY other writings of the time. (John 8:31, also compare, Rev. 22:18,19)\n \n \nThis is still the way of the Orthodox Church in that we don't jump to making dogmas.\n\n Fantastic, because this is the stance of the Witnesses also, in that if it disagrees with the 66 books of the Bible then we dismiss it. Some common ground I do believe. Good.\n \n \nYou must note that the Nicene Creed was drawn up BEFORE the Bible was compiled.\n\n \n So with the aforementioned verses of the Bible in mind, the question is-Compiled or completed?\n \n \nSt. John's testimony is yet more explicit than that of the Synoptists. He expressly asserts that the very purpose of his Gospel is to establish the Divinity of Jesus Christ (John 20:31).\n\n \n Some more common ground, Excellent, although I don't think we have the same thought in mind we say the 'Divinity of Jesus'. We say this because at Isaiah. 9:6 it describes Jesus as a \"Mighty God\", however only Jehovah is ever referred to as Almighty God. Notice to that at John 17:3 Jesus himself speaks of his father as \"the only true God\". Am I right in thinking that your view of the trinity is that all three (father, son and holy spirit) are eternal, almighty and all knowing? Yes or no will suffice.\n \n \nIn the prologue he identifies Him with the Word,\n\n \n Once more we are agreed.\n \n \nWho from all eternity exists with God, Who is God (John 1:1-18).\n\n \n Now comes a fundamental disagreement.\n Jesus indeed existed with God in the beginning according to your rendition of the scriptures; however there seems to be a drastic mistake in the translation \"the word was God\" \n Quotes From 'Reasoning from the Scriptures' (WBTS)\n John 1:1, 2:\n RS reads: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.\" (KJ, Dy, JB, NAB use similar wording.) However, NWT reads: \"In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god. This one was in the beginning with God.\"\n Which translation of John 1:1, 2 agrees with the context? John 1:18 says: \"No one has ever seen God.\" \u00deJoh 1 \u00dcVerse 14 clearly says that \"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us . . . we have beheld his glory.\" Also, \u00deJoh 1 \u00dcverses 1, 2 say that in the beginning he was \"with God.\" Can one be with someone and at the same time be that person? At John 17:3, Jesus addresses the Father as \"the only true God\"; so, Jesus as \"a god\" merely reflects his Father's divine qualities.-Heb. 1:3.\n Is the rendering \"a god\" consistent with the rules of Greek grammar? Some reference books argue strongly that the Greek text must be translated, \"The Word was God.\" But not all agree. In his article \"Qualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,\" Philip B. Harner said that such clauses as the one in John 1:1, \"with an anarthrous predicate preceding the verb, are primarily qualitative in meaning. They indicate that the logos has the nature of theos.\" He suggests: \"Perhaps the clause could be translated, 'the Word had the same nature as God.'\" (Journal of Biblical Literature, 1973, pp. 85, 87) Thus, in this text, the fact that the word the\u00b7os' in its second occurrence is without the definite article (ho) and is placed before the verb in the sentence in Greek is significant. Interestingly, translators that insist on rendering John 1:1, \"The Word was God,\" do not hesitate to use the indefinite article (a, an) in their rendering of other passages where a singular anarthrous predicate noun occurs before the verb. Thus at John 6:70, JB and KJ both refer to Judas Iscariot as \"a devil,\" and at John 9:17 they describe Jesus as \"a prophet.\"\n John J. McKenzie, S.J., in his Dictionary of the Bible, says: \"Jn 1:1 should rigorously be translated 'the word was with the God [= the Father], and the word was a divine being.'\"-(Brackets are his. Published with nihil obstat and imprimatur.) (New York, 1965), p. 317.\n In harmony with the above, AT reads: \"the Word was divine\"; Mo, \"the Logos was divine\"; NTIV, \"the word was a god.\" In his German translation Ludwig Thimme expresses it in this way: \"God of a sort the Word was.\" Referring to the Word (who became Jesus Christ) as \"a god\" is consistent with the use of that term in the rest of the Scriptures. For example, at Psalm 82:1-6 human judges in Israel were referred to as \"gods\" (Hebrew, 'elo\u00b7him'; Greek, the\u00b7oi', at John 10:34) because they were representatives of Jehovah and were to speak his law.\n \n So before we both expand on the book of John it would be wise to clear up the misunderstanding between us of this primary context.\n Would you not agree?\n \n \nFinally, before Caiphas He not merely declares Himself to be the Messias, but in reply to a second and distinct question affirms His claim to be the Son of God. He is instantly declared by the high priest to be guilty of blasphemy, an offence which could not have been attached to the claim to be simply the Messias (Luke 22:66-71).\n\n \n Once again we agree on the accusation of blasphemy made to Jesus for confirming he was the Son of God, but please confirm your case because they never claimed he was saying he was Almighty God, simply the Son of God. Verse 69 says he will sit at the right hand of God, To be on the right hand of a ruler was to have the most important position, next to the ruler himself (Ps 110:1; Ac 7:55, 56; Ro 8:34; 1Pe 3:22), not to actually be that berson.\n What do you think?\n \nThere is indirect evidence too...\n In the parable of the wicked husbandmen, He describes Himself as the son of the householder, while the Prophets, one and all, are represented as the servants (Matthew 21:33 sqq.). That is, Jesus is the Son, allegorically directly of the flesh of the Father.\n\n I don't understand your case, please read following, which agrees with more conclusively with the scriptures.\n Quotes. The Watchtower, 1st Jan. 1990 p.8\n Jesus next shows that the failure of these religious leaders is not simply in neglecting to serve God. No, but they are actually evil, wicked men. \"There was a man, a householder,\" Jesus relates, \"who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower, and let it out to cultivators, and traveled abroad. When the season of the fruits came around, he dispatched his slaves to the cultivators to get his fruits. However, the cultivators took his slaves, and one they beat up, another they killed, another they stoned. Again he dispatched other slaves, more than the first, but they did the same to these.\"\n The \"slaves\" are the prophets that the \"householder,\" Jehovah God, sent to \"the cultivators\" of his \"vineyard.\" These cultivators are leading representatives of the nation of Israel, which nation the Bible identifies as God's \"vineyard.\"\n Since \"the cultivators\" mistreat and kill the \"slaves,\" Jesus explains: \"Lastly [the owner of the vineyard] dispatched his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' On seeing the son the cultivators said among themselves, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance!' So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.\"\n Now, addressing the religious leaders, Jesus asks: \"When the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those cultivators?\"\n \"Because they are evil,\" they answer, \"he will bring an evil destruction upon them and will let out the vineyard to other cultivators, who will render him the fruits when they become due.\"\n The religious leaders thus unwittingly proclaim judgment upon themselves, since they are included among the Israelite \"cultivators\" of Jehovah's national \"vineyard\" of Israel. The fruitage that Jehovah expects from such cultivators is faith in his Son, the true Messiah. For their failing to provide such fruitage, Jesus warns: \"Did you never read in the Scriptures [at Psalm 118:22, 23], 'The stone that the builders rejected is the one that has become the chief cornerstone. From Jehovah this has come to be, and it is marvelous in our eyes'? This is why I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits. Also, the person falling upon this stone will be shattered. As for anyone upon whom it falls, it will pulverize him.\"\n What do you think?\n \n \nAlso, Jesus developed no creed regarding not eating pork. We eat pork because of what the Apostles decided.\n\n \n Sausages for me tonight then. Watch out for poor websites.\n Where did you hear this?\n \nThey are one \n I John 5:7 \"There are those that bear record in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one\"\n\n \n Another disagreement, they can't be one entity, battle lines (contradictions) would be drawn up within scriptures, something that as a true Christian I know can't be the case. (2Tim 3:16). Consider and reason with me on just two of the verses that prove this, the first - Matt. 26:39. Jesus came not to do his own will but the will of the father, not one in the same will either, Jesus prayed to his father so if they were the same entity such a prayer would have been meaningless, Jesus would in effect be praying to himself. The second - John 8:17, 18, \"[Jesus answered the Jewish Pharisees:] In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true; I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.\" (So, Jesus definitely spoke of himself as being an individual separate and distinct from the Father.)\n \n Quotes from 'Reasoning from the scriptures' (WBTS)\n 1 John 5:7, 8:\n KJ reads: \"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.\" (Dy also includes this Trinitarian passage.) However, NW does not include the words \"in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth.\" (RS, NE, TEV, JB, NAB also leave out the Trinitarian passage.)\n Regarding this Trinitarian passage, textual critic F. H. A. Scrivener wrote: \"We need not hesitate to declare our conviction that the disputed words were not written by St. John: that they were originally brought into Latin copies in Africa from the margin, where they had been placed as a pious and orthodox gloss on ver. \u00de1Jo 5:\u00dc8: that from the Latin they crept into two or three late Greek codices, and thence into the printed Greek text, a place to which they had no rightful claim.\"-A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament (Cambridge, 1883, third ed.), p. 654.\n What do you think?\n \n \nThey are equal\n Colossians 1:19\n \"For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him\"\n\n Again I would have to scriptural disagree, swords would now drawn on the battle lines, why? Lets see, again just two scriptures will be used at this time, first - Mark 13:32, \"Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\" (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?). second - Matt. 20:20-23, RS: \"The mother of the sons of Zebedee . . . said to him [Jesus], 'Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.' But Jesus answered, . . . 'You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.'\" (How strange, if, as claimed, Jesus is God! Was Jesus here merely answering according to his \"human nature\"? If, as Trinitarians say, Jesus was truly \"God-man\"-both God and man, not one or the other-would it truly be consistent to resort to such an explanation? Does not Matthew 20:23 rather show that the Son is not equal to the Father, that the Father has reserved some prerogatives for himself?)\n Quotes The Watchtower, 1st April, 1978, p. 17.\n Recognize Christ's Vital Place\n Recognition of Christ's headship, however, is not just a matter of acknowledging his foremost position in the congregation. Note that the apostle Paul continues: \"God saw good for all fullness to dwell in him.\" (Col. 1:19) According to God's good pleasure, Jesus Christ occupies the foremost place in the congregation, not only as regards preeminence and authority, but also in having the \"fullness\" of everything that Christians need. The Son of God is the embodiment of divine qualities, including wisdom. Hence, he, not any human on earth, is the one to whom true Christians look as their exemplar and the appointed source of guidance and instruction.\n What do you think?\n \n All Christian love.",

Clearly there is no indefinite article in the greek. It simply does not exist. One must look to the context. John stated that he was refering to the deity of Christ. In Rev 1:8, it says that God the almighty is the alpha and omega, in verses 17 an 18 Jesus is called the first and the last (note the definite article) and THE LIVING ONE, a clear reference to God. and Rev 10:6 says \"and swore by Him wo lives forever and ever , who created heaven and earth\"(See also ex 20:11.)\n \n And Revelation 19:10 where John falls at the feet of an angel and he is told to worship God (Theos, god the father). We are told to worship Jesus in many places, even you would agree with that. In 21:6 Jesus tells Joh that He is THE Alpha and Omega (again a clear reference that Jesus is THE god. Rev 19:13; \"His name is called \"THE word of God.. Only God may be referred to as King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Wouldn't your explanation lead to God being called the king of kings of kings? \n \n In Rev 22:16 Jesus refers to himself as the bright and morning star. Mat 2:2 says \"where is He who has been born the king of the Jews?? For we saw his star and have come to WORSHIP him.\"\n \n Jesus is God. At least a reasonable translation of greek leads one to believe so. Your adding the indefinite article is unjustified. Your translation is one that was begun in the late 1800s yet you say that there is no early church approval of the trinity. Yet there has been agreement on this fact amongst catholics, protestants, and orthodox for thousands of years (hundreds in the case of protestants). You are simply way off base and so caught up in your own doctrine as to not see the truth. The JW claims to be the 144000 that scripture mentions, yet there are millions of you. I am sure you found a way to justify that once your numbers increased above the 144000. I'll bet there is no real answer to that in your doctrine prior to that increase.",

(Even the judges of ancient Israel, who wielded great power in the nation, were called \"gods.\" [Ps 82:6; Joh 10:34, 35]) Actually, in the Greek text, the definite article ho, \"the,\" appears before the first \"God,\" but there is no article before the second.\n Other translations aid in getting the proper view. The interlinear word-for-word reading of the Greek translation in the Emphatic Diaglott reads: \"In a beginning was the Word, and the Word was with the God, and a god was the Word.\" The accompanying text of the Diaglott uses capital and small capital letters for the God, and initial capital and lowercase letters for the second appearance of \"God\" in the sentence: \"In the Beginning was the LOGOS, and the LOGOS was with GOD, and the LOGOS was God.\"\n These renderings would support the fact that Jesus, being the Son of God and the one used by God in creating all other things (Col 1:15-20), is indeed a \"god,\" a mighty one, and has the quality of mightiness, but is not the Almighty God. Other translations reflect this view. The New English Bible says: \"And what God was, the Word was.\" The Greek word translated \"Word\" is Lo'gos; and so Moffatt's translation reads: \"The Logos was divine.\" The American Translation reads: \"The Word was divine.\" Other readings, by German translators, follow. By B\u00f6hmer: \"It was tightly bound up with God, yes, itself of divine being.\" By Stage: \"The Word was itself of divine being.\" By Menge: \"And God (= of divine being) the Word was.\" And by Thimme: \"And God of a sort the Word was.\" All these renderings highlight the quality of the Word, not his identity with his Father, the Almighty God. Being the Son of Jehovah God, he would have the divine quality, for divine means \"godlike.\"-Col 2:9; compare 2Pe 1:4, where \"divine nature\" is promised to Christ's joint heirs.\n The Four Gospels-A New Translation, by Professor Charles Cutler Torrey, says: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was god. When he was in the beginning with God all things were created through him; without him came no created thing into being.\" (Joh 1:1-3) Note that what the Word is said to be is spelled without a capital initial letter, namely, \"god.\"\n This Word, or Lo'gos, was God's only direct creation, the only-begotten son of God, and evidently the close associate of God to whom God was speaking when he said: \"Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.\" (Ge 1:26) Hence John continued, saying: \"This one was in the beginning with God. All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.\"-Joh 1:2, 3.\n Other scriptures plainly show that the Word was God's agent through whom all other things came into existence. There is \"one God the Father, out of whom all things are, . . . and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are.\" (1Co 8:6) The Word, God's Son, was \"the beginning of the creation by God,\" otherwise described as \"the firstborn of all creation; because by means of him all other things were created in the heavens and upon the earth.\"-Re 3:14; Col 1:15, 16.\n \n \nOne must look to the context.\n\n \n Common Ground, John 1:18 says: \n Quotes 'RFTS' (WBTS) \"No one has ever seen God.\" \u00deJoh 1 \u00dcVerse 14 clearly says that \"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us . . . we have beheld his glory.\" Also, \u00deJoh 1 \u00dcverses 1, 2 say that in the beginning he was \"with God.\" Can one be with someone and at the same time be that person? At John 17:3, Jesus addresses the Father as \"the only true God\"; so, Jesus as \"a god\" merely reflects his Father's divine qualities.-Heb. 1:3. \n In my opinion there are three types of war that can occur in the Bible. \n 1) National war = Contradiction between books in the Bible\n 2) Civil war = Contradiction of chapters. \n 3) Neighbours from hell = Contradiction of one verse in itself i.e. John 1:1 You can't be with someone and actually be that person. \n \n \nIn Rev 1:8, it says that God the almighty is the alpha and omega,\n\n Correct!\n Quotes 'Insight on the Scriptures' (WBTS)\n Alpha and Omega \n While many commentators apply this title both to God and to Christ, a more careful examination of its use restricts its application to Jehovah God. The first verse of Revelation shows that the revelation was given originally by God and through Jesus Christ, hence the one speaking (through an angelic representative) at times is God himself, and at other times it is Christ Jesus. (Re 22:8) Thus Revelation 1:8 (RS) says: \"'I am the Alpha and the Omega,' says the Lord God [\"Jehovah God,\" NW], who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.\" Although the preceding verse speaks of Christ Jesus, it is clear that in verse 8 the application of the title is to \"the Almighty\" God. In this regard Barnes' Notes on the New Testament (1974) observes: \"It cannot be absolutely certain that the writer meant to refer to the Lord Jesus specifically here . . . There is no real incongruity in supposing, also, that the writer here meant to refer to God as such.\"\n The title occurs again at Revelation 21:6, and the following verse identifies the speaker by saying: \"Anyone conquering will inherit these things, and I shall be his God and he will be my son.\" Inasmuch as Jesus referred to those who are joint heirs with him in his Kingdom as \"brothers,\" not \"sons,\" the speaker must be Jesus' heavenly Father, Jehovah God.-Mt 25:40; compare Heb 2:10-12.\n The final occurrence of the title is at Revelation 22:13, which states: \"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" It is evident that a number of persons are represented as speaking in this chapter of Revelation; verses 8 and 9 show that the angel spoke to John, verse 16 obviously applies to Jesus, the first part of verse 17 is credited to \"the spirit and the bride,\" and the one speaking in the latter part of verse 20 is manifestly John himself. \"The Alpha and the Omega\" of verses 12-15, therefore, may properly be identified as the same one who bears the title in the other two occurrences: Jehovah God. The expression, \"Look! I am coming quickly,\" in verse 12, does not require that these aforementioned verses apply to Jesus, inasmuch as God also speaks of himself as \"coming\" to execute judgment. (Compare Isa 26:21.) Malachi 3:1-6 speaks of a joint coming for judgment on the part of Jehovah and his \"messenger of the covenant.\"\n \n in verses 17 an 18 Jesus is called the first and the last (note the definite article) and THE LIVING ONE, a clear reference to God.\n Quotes 'Revelation - its Grand Climax at Hand' (WBTS)\n \"The First and the Last\"\n 2 Nevertheless, our awe need not give way to morbid fear. Jesus reassured John, as the apostle next relates. \"And he laid his right hand upon me and said: 'Do not be fearful. I am the First and the Last, and the living one.'\" (Revelation 1:17b, 18a) In Isaiah 44:6, Jehovah rightly describes his own position as the one and only almighty God, saying: \"I am the first and I am the last, and besides me there is no God.\" When Jesus presents himself by the title \"the First and the Last,\" he is not claiming equality with Jehovah, the Grand Creator. He is using a title properly bestowed on him by God. In Isaiah, Jehovah was making a statement about His unique position as the true God. He is God eternal, and besides him there is indeed no God. (1 Timothy 1:17) In Revelation, Jesus is talking about his bestowed title, calling attention to his unique resurrection.\n 3 Jesus was indeed \"the First\" human to be resurrected to immortal spirit life. (Colossians 1:18) Moreover, he is \"the Last\" to be so resurrected by Jehovah personally. Thus, he becomes \"the living one . . . living forever and ever.\" He enjoys immortality. In this, he is like his immortal Father, who is called \"the living God.\" (Revelation 7:2; Psalm 42:2) For all others of humanity, Jesus himself is \"the resurrection and the life.\" (John 11:25)\n As has been said before Just because two people in the scriptures are referred to in the same way it doesn't present a scriptural basis for making them into the same person.\n Do you not agree?\n \n \nOnly God may be referred to as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.\n\n \n See Dan: 2:37.\n I would like to point out to everyone that Jehovah Witnesses are here only presenting a scriptural basis for their beliefs.\n Sincere Love.",

There is with certainty a scriptural basis for making them one. I do not accept the NWT as reasonable given its hermaneutic which comes from the JW doctrine as opposed to developing Doctrine out of the bible. You also ignore the fact that The NWT is relatively recent and does not agree with the most ancient writings. You ignore the historical statements of the trinity provided by both myself and montalban. Your arguments don't wash. You only argue with an item or two and then assume the others to be incorrect. There is an indefinite article in english and the NASB does not add one where one does not exist without showing that one does not exist. I find this translation style to be the most accurate in statement. It clearly states \"The Word was God.\" The context clearly points to Jesus as the almighty, the alpha and the omega, mighty God, prince of peace, Son of God, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.\n \n Jesus clearly refers to himself the same as God in the book of Revelation, In John, In Matthew and In Mark and Luke. That is plenty for me. And he means per the context and direct quote the almighty God.",

He didn't seem to care which biblical teachings he embraced and which he rejected, so long as the resulting doctrinal pastiche would be exotic. Rejecting blood transfusions on \"biblical\" grounds is one of the odd tenets that make the Watchtower a truly odd organization. Witnesses cite two verses as bases for their position: \"You shall eat no blood whatever, whether of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwellings. Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people\" (Lev. 7:26-27); \"For the life of every creature is the blood of it; therefore I have said to the people of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off\" (Lev. 17:14). \n Besides being inconsistent by retaining this particular Old Covenant prohibition while ignoring others, such as circumcision (cf. Gen. 17:2-14) and kosher dietary laws (cf. Deut. 14:3-21), Witnesses misunderstand what these passages are talking about. In both Leviticus 7 and 17 the prohibition is against the eating of blood, not reception of blood through transfusions (a medical procedure which was developed only within the last century). Witnesses ignore the fact that in a single passage in Leviticus the Lord prohibits the eating of both blood and fat: \"It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, in all your dwelling places, that you eat neither fat nor blood\" (3:17). Yet the Watchtower does not condemn the eating of fat, and no Jehovah's Witness would feel any moral compunction against eating a bag of fried pork rinds or enjoying a nice, fatty cut of prime rib. This is a good example of the Watchtower's selective \"theology.\"",

   "You must note that the Nicene Creed was drawn up BEFORE the Bible was compiled. \n\n \n \nSo with the aforementioned verses of the Bible in mind, the question is-Compiled or completed?\n\n \n This word game misses the point. If the idea of the trinity were so unclear, then you'd expect the compilers of the Bible to do a massive re-edit of the books of the bible to post facto give their case a better claim. They did not, because they understood the Bible's passages as supporting the Trinity.\n \n Not only have I shown you Bible verses from John et al, there's also Paul\n 2 Corinthians 13\n 14\n May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.\n \n They are mentioned together in the one blessing. They have been shown to be equal.\n \n \nThey did not 'develop' the doctrine of the Trinity. The Trinity is truth. One does not 'develop' truth. Therefore no Christian should believe that which you say about Jesus Christ and His Apostles. \n\n \n \n Firstly, and I hope you will agree that it is the word of God that is truth (John 17:17) and which is to be held in an absolute authority over ANY other writings of the time. (John 8:31, also compare, Rev. 22:18,19)\n\n \n Let's look at what case you're trying to make.\n John 17\n 17\n Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.\n \n John 8\n The Children of Abraham \n 31\n To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. \n \n How does this conflict with Holy Tradition?\n \n Do you not know that John's Gospel gives the basis of it...\n John 21\n 25\n Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. \n \n These all suggest that the teachings of Christ weren't all written down. Word means also 'spoken word'. Jesus conferred His teachings upon His Apostles. They in turn handed these down. This is known as Apostolic Succession. My church can trace this from our current Bishop Paul, all the way back to St. Peter.\n \n You made the claim that the Trinity was unknown to the Early Church.\n \n I showed you writings from St Clement of Rome (written before some of the books of the Bible were written), and from St Ignatius of Antioch. Both these writers supported the Trinity. Both these writers were directly taught by the Apostles, especially St. Peter. They were taught by Word of mouth, not by written Scripture. They held fast to the teachings of Christ before it was the written Word. Both wrote before the Bible was compiled. Both were taught by those who knew the Word of God, as taught to them by Jesus, before the Word was written.\n \n Recall my quote....\n Epistle to the Magnesians\n \"CHAPTER 7\n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n The unity of them is continually repeated...\n He opens his Epistle to the Philadelphians\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, to the church of God the Father and of Jesus Christ, which is in Philadelphia of Asia...\"\n by mentioning them together.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-philadelphians-lightfoot.html\n \n Again in his opening address to his Epistle the Romans\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, unto her that hath found mercy in the bountifulness of the Father Most High and of Jesus Christ His only Son; to the church that is beloved and enlightened through the will of Him who willed all things that are, by faith\n and love towards Jesus Christ our God; even unto her that hath the presidency in the country of the region of the Romans, being worthy of God, worthy of honour, worthy of felicitation, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy in purity, and having the presidency of love, walking in the law of Christ and bearing the Father's name; which church also I salute in the name\n of Jesus Christ the Son of the Father; unto them that in flesh and spirit are united unto His every commandment, being filled with the grace of God without wavering, and filtered clear from every foreign stain; abundant greeting in Jesus Christ our God in blamelessness.\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-romans-lightfoot.html\n God and Jesus, Jesus and God. He says Jesus is the only Son of God, no mention that Satan is a co-creation equal to Jesus. Jesus is the Son of God, He is also God.\n \n Epistle to the Ephesians\n CHAPTER 5\n 5:1 For if I in a short time had such converse with your bishop, which was not after the manner of men but in the Spirit, how much more do I congratulate you who are closely joined with him as the Church is with Jesus Christ and as Jesus Christ is with the Father, that all things may be harmonious in unity.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-ephesians-lightfoot.html\n \n That is, unity of the community, of the church, of Christ with God.\n \n But also 'three' comes up so many times,\n Further in his Epistle to the Ephesians\n CHAPTER 19\n 19:1 And hidden from the prince of this world were the virginity of Mary and her child-bearing and likewise also the death of the Lord -- three mysteries to be cried aloud -- the which were wrought in the silence of God.\n Ibid\n \"The episkopoi's immediate subordinates were the `presbyteroi' and the `diakonoi' who together with him constituted the higher Kleroi, a trinity if you will: the Father (episkopos), Son (diakonos) and spirit-filled apostolic council (presbyteroi)\"\n http://www.thecosmiccontext.de/chri.../Ignatius1.html\n As stated earlier, the organisation of the Church reflected the triune nature of God. One Church, three offices of clergy.\n \n This reflects the passages in Scripture that say that Jesus was with the fullness of God, that is, they are united, and they are equal.\n 1 Cor 1\n 24\n \"...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"\n \n Which is why Jesus Himself commanded\n Matthew 28\n 19\n Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, \n \n Thus the Didache* (written after 50 AD but before 120AD; and again, well before some of the books of the Bible were written) states...\n 7:1 But concerning baptism, thus shall ye baptise.\n 7:2 Having first recited all these things, baptise {in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit} in living (running) water.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-lightfoot.html\n \n \n Please also note in a previous post I mentioned you had ignored Acts of the Apostles, and the foundations of the Church\n Acts 8\n 14\n When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.\n 15\n When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, \n 16\n because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus. 17\n Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. \n \n That is, some had taken faith, and had been baptised, but had not received the gift of the Holy Spirit until it had been conferred upon them through Christ's Apostles; Peter and John. This too is surely a sign of the unity of Christ with God. For Christ was able to confer such a commission onto men, that they might be able to confer God's Holy Spirit upon others.\n \n \n \n \n *The Didache also states;\n 8:1 And let not your fastings be with the hypocrites, for they fast on the second and the fifth day of the week;\n 8:2 but do ye keep your fast on the fourth and on the preparation (the sixth) day.\n \n And for this very reason people in my church still fasts on Wednesdays and Fridays.\n More importantly, it gives mention of the Eucharist\n 9:1 But as touching the eucharistic thanksgiving give ye thanks thus.\n 9:2 First, as regards the cup:\n etc...\n \n That is, the Body of Christ. That means that right from the beginning Christians believed in the 'Lord's Supper' as partaking of the actual Body of Christ; NOT some symbolic meal-sharing.\n We are Orthodox. We have always worshipped this way.",

   "To All,\n \n Maximus, E,F, I'm sorry I'm not ignoring you simply prioritising (not you, your cases) please don't be offended, I have read all your posts and will reply in due course. however please read this and reason if it fits well with the scriptures.\n Quotes 'Should you Believe in the Trinity' (WBTS)\n How Much Was the Ransom?\n ONE of the main reasons why Jesus came to earth also has a direct bearing on the Trinity. The Bible states: \"There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all.\"-1 Timothy 2:5, 6.\n became a ransom that compensated exactly for what Adam lost-the right to perfect human life on earth. So Jesus could rightly be called \"the last Adam\" by the apostle Paul, who said in the same context: \"Just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive.\" (1 Corinthians 15:22, 45) The perfect human life of Jesus was the \"corresponding ransom\" required by divine justice-no more, no less. A basic principle even of human justice is that the price paid should fit the wrong committed.\n If Jesus, however, were part of a Godhead, the ransom price would have been infinitely higher than what God's own Law required. (Exodus 21:23-25; Leviticus 24:19-21) It was only a perfect human, Adam, who sinned in Eden, not God. So the ransom, to be truly in line with God's justice, had to be strictly an equivalent-a perfect human, \"the last Adam.\" Thus, when God sent Jesus to earth as the ransom, he made Jesus to be what would satisfy justice, not an incarnation, not a god-man, but a perfect man, \"lower than angels.\" (Hebrews 2:9; compare Psalm 8:5, 6.) How could any part of an almighty Godhead-Father, Son, or holy spirit-ever be lower than angels?\n \n Hank, and all\n So moving on to what hank rightly said, \"Jesus, no more and no less than a perfect human,\" this is reflected in the fact that all of Jehovah's creation from Jesus down to Adam share a common equality, in the sense that we all had a beginning and we all have (or had) a chance of eternal life (I'm not saying there is not authority within the creation), note though that they all have to do this in complete obedience. However the charge that Satan made in the Garden of Eden brought into question Gods right to rule his creation, an element of this charge is brought out in the book of Job, which is - can humans stay integral to God regardless of conditions. Although this charge was unjustified as Jesus (and of course Job) proved, this issue still had to be resolved, or proven before all for it to be legal, firstly to Jehovah so that he could answer Satan's charge (Pro. 27,11) and secondly to all in witness of this event so that Jehovah's Grand name could be sanctified. So then, if Jesus were part of the God-head the whole obedience issue would not have been settled because Satan would simply say he was obedient to himself and would again nullify the arrangement.\n Or;\n Another angle, Jesus being rightly referred to as a god could not unbalance the arrangement because looking through the scriptures we find that humans as well have been referred as gods, this simply stating a position of authority. So then there could be no doubt that Adam the potential father of the entire human race would have been referred to as a god. Jesus being endowed with the former knowledge of his heavenly life couldn't make it unbalanced either because Adam being taught by Jehovah would have had a vast knowledge of heavenly life also, Gen. 2:15,16 would indicate that the 'settling in the garden' would mean answering some very important questions from Adam regarding his creation, where he was, who made him, who Jehovah was and so on. Making his knowledge as a perfect man who was unable to forget things huge. \n Does this sound viable?\n Hank, I've keep this brief, apologies. \n \n \nOthers have dealt with the context of John etc (though you made no defence of your claim about the 'early' church, which I rebutted. So I'm stuck with the more mundane; meat.\n\n \n The point has been laid out by you (very well I might add) but this just highlights the huge trinity controversy of the time, however the defence of establishment is moving outside the scriptures, would the warning of Rev. 22:18, 19 have been recorded if God had of intended any other writings or authority to add text or teachings. Please reason.\n \n \nWhy won't Jehovah's Witnesses accept blood transfusions, even when their lives are in jeopardy?\n\n \n One thing at a time! But in brief the law was carried forward. If your sincere you'll find it. \n \n \nNot only have I shown you Bible verses from John et al, there's also Paul\n 2 Corinthians 13\n 14\n May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.\n \n They are mentioned together in the one blessing. They have been shown to be equal.\n\n \n No montalban, nowhere in this verse does it say that they are equal, please explain how you come to such a conclusion. \n I remember asking you a question at the end of a post I made concerning the stability of the establishment, it's very inportant question that has a very impotant scriptual answer, from God to you.\n \nQuotes 'The Watchtower' 1st may, 1987,\n \n Holding to the Inspired Word\n 15 The churches say that practices such as venerating the cross are part of \"sacred tradition.\" But when tradition conflicts with God's Word, those who love God reject the tradition. What we really need for true worship is already included in God's Word. As Paul wrote Timothy: \"From infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.\" (2 Timothy 3:15-17) Nowhere does the Bible say that traditions that contradict God's Word are indispensable for salvation.\n 16 The conflict between the Scriptures and human tradition is not new. During the period from the completing of the inspired Hebrew Scriptures to the coming of Jesus, the Jewish religious leaders added many oral traditions, which they later committed to writing that was not inspired by God. Those traditions often conflicted with the Scriptures. So Jesus told the religious leaders: \"Why is it you also overstep the commandment of God because of your tradition? . . . You have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition.\" He applied God's Word to them when it said: \"It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.\" (Matthew 15:1-6, 9) In his teachings, Jesus never quoted from such traditions. His appeal was to the inspired written Word of God.-Matthew 4:4-10; Mark 12:10; Luke 10:26.\n 17 God did not leave the preservation of \"the word of life\" in the insecure hands of religious traditionalists. (Philippians 2:16) Instead, by his powerful holy spirit, he inspired the writing of the Bible so that \"through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.\" (Romans 15:4) To say that the Bible is incomplete and that we need to rely also on the unstable thinking of imperfect, uninspired men is to deny the power of God. Surely, the almighty, awesome Creator of the universe could author a book! And he did this so that we could have a solid anchor for our hope and not have to depend on human traditions that lead people to violate God's commandments. Hence, God's Word says: \"Do not go beyond the things that are written.\" (1 Corinthians 4:6) Those who truly love God will observe that counsel.-See also Proverbs 30:5, 6.\n \"Observe His Commandments\"\n 18 \"This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments,\" states 1 John 5:3. When religious leaders water down those commandments, or ignore them, or substitute conflicting traditions of men, then they lead their followers contrary to God's will. As an example, consider a fundamental principle of Christianity: love. It was a vital part of Jesus' teaching. He said: \"You must love your neighbor as yourself.\"-Matthew 22:39.\n 19 How important is this neighbor love? Jesus taught that true Christians can be identified by the love they have among themselves. He said: \"I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.\" (John 13:34, 35) True, the Law to ancient Israel included a commandment to \"love your fellow as yourself.\" (Leviticus 19:18) But what was new about Jesus' command was his expression, \"just as I have loved you.\" This gave greater power to Christian love, for a Christian must even be willing to lay down his life for fellow believers, just as Jesus did.\n 20 Thus, true servants of God today can be identified by an unbreakable, unifying bond of love on an international scale. Who in our time demonstrate such obedience to God's commandments on love? Who have been persecuted, imprisoned, thrown into concentration camps, or executed because they would not take up weapons against fellow believers-or even unbelievers-of other nations? The record of this century's history answers: only Jehovah's Witnesses.\n 21 On the other hand, Christendom's religions have regularly broken God's commandments regarding love. In all the wars of this century, the clergy of Christendom's churches have led their people to meet on opposing sides of battlefields and to slaughter one another by the millions. Protestants killed fellow Protestants, Catholics killed fellow Catholics, yet all claimed to be Christian. But God's Word declares: \"If anyone makes the statement: 'I love God,' and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from him, that the one who loves God should be loving his brother also.\"-1 John 4:20, 21.\n 22 God's Word also says: \"The children of God and the children of the Devil are evident by this fact: Everyone who does not carry on righteousness does not originate with God, neither does he who does not love his brother. . . . We should have love for one another; not like Cain, who originated with the wicked one and slaughtered his brother.\" (1 John 3:10-12) The churches of Christendom claim to be children of God, but they cannot be, for they grossly disobey God's commandments on love and 'slaughter their brother.' They can only be children of \"the wicked one.\" Hence, God's Word urges sincere ones in such religions: \"Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.\" (Revelation 18:4) Soon God will execute his judgments against all false religions. Those who cling to them will suffer their fate. (Revelation 17:16) On the other hand, \"he that does the will of God remains forever.\"-1 John 2:17.\n \n All Love, and peace.",

   "He's just posted the bible.\n \n It seems to me intepretation is more important than content, but yet again whos intepretation is correct?\n\n \n Plotter, you make a good point. There is variation amongst interpretation. There are objective rules to be applied to allow for good interpretation. This is a discipline called Hermaneutics. It provides rules on how to read the bible. One of those is keep it in context. Another is don't insert what isn't there. another is the bible cannot contradict itself. In places where it seems contradictory this must be kept in mind and an alternative interpretation examined.\n \n Richard quotes for The watchtower (Jehova's Witness) bible. Their interpretation does not even use basic greek grammer and changes words where appropriate to prove their doctrine. This is called prooftexting. It is a major violation of basic interpretation. \n \n Now, all protestants and catholics disagree to some extent on the interpretation of various parts of the bible. However, the agree on the major components of doctrine. This has been true down through the millenia. The JW bible and differences came about in the late 1800's as I recall. The founder decided he was one of the 144, 000 that are referred to in Revelation and began a group surrounding this. (I think this is true and do not have a good source. It is only hearsay and you should check it out for yourself. I would not listen to a JW or any protestant but would investigate the historical accuracy of these statements). They then decided to change things in the bible based on their continuing developing doctrine. \n \n The bible is meant to provide doctrine not the other way around. anyway, long answer to a very good statement. Continue to question this way and seek what is the real truth. Regardless of what you think of it now, you will find truth if you look for it.",

   "My theory is that the modern English language is to blame. When you capitalize god it turns it into the god Jehovah. In ancient languages names tended to be descriptions or phrases, but in modern English names are meaningless phonetic labels used to separate or group individuals. Open any baby name book you'll get the point. \n \n When you substitute a name for a title bad things happen. So Jesus can't be God and God, because God said only worship God. So Jesus must be God too. So God sent God to die then God raised from the dead. \n \n If you look at the meaning of Theos in the context of Greek society they had no YHWH in their pantheon. It is okay to have Jesus and YHWH be Theos. The Greeks did not care. The ancient Hebrews likewise had \"El\" which the Greek equated to the root \"The\". Later English comes up with God and god to separate the Christian God/s from Pagan God/s. Calamity ensues.\n \n Jehovah \"He Causes to Become\"\n \n Jesus \"Jehovah Is Salvation\"\n \n Michael \"Who Is Like God\"\n \n Immanuel \"With Us Is God\"\n \n If I am wrong tell me. To say (insert biblical character here) referred to (insert a figure of the godhead here) as God so that proves (insert belief here) boarders on fallacy. I am almost totally assured every one in the bible was \"polytheists\" and native speakers were not squeamish about whom they called God. I assume in Jesus day God the father was assumed by Jesus followers to the head of the house and have authority over God the son, and like a biological father existed before God the son.\n \n If you believe in the trinity I assume you don't believe this. I ask for you to please explain the trinity vs. the father son relationship. Please don't use a clover ;)",

   "To All,\n At the outset of my postings I made it clear that my aim was to, using the Bible, counter the false teaching regarding the Christ, which I hope I am doing in a fair and just way. I would again like to make it clear that it is not my intention to destroy the love that these people clearly have for God and for the Bible, but IT IS FAIR from the standpoint of God that he has his people recognise him for what he says he is and not what people want him to be. He is also very clear that the scriptures are the only place to look for the answer, \"From infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for SETTING THINGS STRAIGHT, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.\" (2 Timothy 3:15-17)\n \n Montalban, I feel the discussion is sliding once again from the scriptures, I have to ask you, do you believe the 66 books of the bible to be the absolute authority from God in discussing who he is? - Keep in mind Rev. 22:18,19. Please let me know the answer to this question because this will prove a big juncture in our discussion.\n \n \nI've given you ample quotes from\n a) the Bible\n b) Sts Ignatius and Clement\n c) The Didache\n \n Jesus is eternal\n Hebrews 13: 8\n Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Your argument is that everywhere we've got the Greek mixed up - we who compiled the Bible in Greek! In effect your argument is, that if you re-write the Bible your Bible interpretations are correct - because we hold true to the Orthodox dogmatic teaching that we've always held.s to these questions\n\n \n My case to you is simple, part A, I will exept, the rest are not Gods inspired word and that, scriptualy speaking, the trinity is not found in the Bible, it can't fit no matter how much it's squeezed and moulded, as I have said before it reacts with the scriptures like nuclear fission, as is laid out below:\n Quotes 'Should you believe in the Trinity' (WBTS)\n Those words are found at Deuteronomy 6:4. The Catholic New Jerusalem Bible (NJB) here reads: \"Listen, Israel: Yahweh our God is the one, the only Yahweh.\" In the grammar of that verse, the word \"one\" has no plural modifiers to suggest that it means anything but one individual.\n The Christian apostle Paul did not indicate any change in the nature of God either, even after Jesus came to the earth. He wrote: \"God is only one.\"-Galatians 3:20; see also 1 Corinthians 8:4-6.\n Thus, Jesus had an existence in heaven before coming to the earth. But was it as one of the persons in an almighty, eternal triune Godhead? No, for the Bible plainly states that in his prehuman existence, Jesus was a created spirit being, just as angels were spirit beings created by God. Neither the angels nor Jesus had existed before their creation.\n Jesus, in his prehuman existence, was \"the first-born of all creation.\" (Colossians 1:15, NJB) He was \"the beginning of God's creation.\" (Revelation 3:14, RS, Catholic edition). \"Beginning\" [Greek, ar\u00b7khe'] cannot rightly be interpreted to mean that Jesus was the 'beginner' of God's creation. In his Bible writings, John uses various forms of the Greek word ar\u00b7khe' more than 20 times, and these always have the common meaning of \"beginning.\" Yes, Jesus was created by God as the beginning of God's invisible creations.\n But what test of loyalty would that be if Jesus were God? Could God rebel against himself? No, but angels and humans could rebel against God and did. The temptation of Jesus would make sense only if he was, not God, but a separate individual who had his own free will, one who could have been disloyal had he chosen to be, such as an angel or a human.\n \n God Superior at All Times\n AT THE very outset of Jesus' ministry, when he came up out of the baptismal water, God's voice from heaven said: \"This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.\" (Matthew 3:16, 17) Was God saying that he was his own son, that he approved himself, that he sent himself? No, God the Creator was saying that he, as the superior, was approving a lesser one, his Son Jesus, for the work ahead.\n Jesus indicated his Father's superiority when he said: \"Jehovah's spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor.\" (Luke 4:18) Anointing is the giving of authority or a commission by a superior to someone who does not already have authority. Here God is plainly the superior, for he anointed Jesus, giving him authority that he did not previously have.\n \n \nWhat other mistakes have been made in interpretations?\n \n Resurrection of the Men of Sodom\n 1879 - They will be resurrected.\n 1952 - They will not be resurrected.\n 1965 - They will be resurrected.\n 1988 - They will not be resurrected.24\n \n The 'Lord' in Romans 10:12-16\n 1903 - 'Lord' refers to Jesus.\n 1940 - 'Lord' refers to Jehovah.\n 1978 - 'Lord' refers to Jesus.\n 1980 - 'Lord' refers to Jehovah.25\n \n 'Higher Powers' of Romans 13:1\n 1916 - 'Higher powers' refers to governments.\n 1943 - 'Higher powers' refers to Jehovah God & Jesus Christ.\n 1964 - 'Higher powers' refers to governments.26\n \n Separating 'sheep and goats' (Matt. 25:31-46)\n 1919 - will take place after the time of tribulation.\n 1923 - is taking place now, before the tribulation.\n 1995 - will take place after the tribulation.27\n http://www.irr.org/English-JW/jwfacten.html\n\n One must say that these accusations are fascinating I never heard some of them before (and I've heard lots) very well researched, but it must be said that they in no way prove the Trinity. However be careful, people may see that your trying to be very underhand. God would like us to stick with the scriptures. \n \n As to your question about the Church... what is it you want to ask?\n\n Is there a prophecy in the Bible that says something about Apostasy concerning the establishment? \n \n \nHe's just posted the bible.\n \n It seems to me intepretation is more important than content, but yet again whos intepretation is correct?\n\n \n Sorry for the huge posts, but to get the correct point across you have to make them full of substance. Who has the correct interpretation? God, the Bible interprets itself if you let it, as is clearly seen by the reasoning on the Ransom. See-Gen. 40:8. and also 2Pe. 1:20,21 which says that Holy spirit is needed, something which the establishment deeply 'grieve' through it's gross wrongdoing. Compare Gal. 5:22-26.\n Love and peace,",

I think it's also fair to say, and I'm not being biased, that this case is a lot more reasonable than any other I have ever heard by any of the churches. However there is still more to the point that must be discussed to strengthen the case, I remember a very good point made by Maximus that the JW's don't believe in the physical resurrection of Christ which is right we don't, we believe he was spiritually resurrected, and this also has a direct bearing on the validity of the ransom. Maximus cited one verse for his case 1cor. 15:17 which says: \" if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in you sins\" NRSV. A good verse Maximus but it doesn't disprove what we are saying. If you cross reference it with 1Cor. 15:45, which says \"\"The first man Adam became a life giving soul.\" The last Adam became a life giving spirit\", so who's the last Adam? Yes, Jesus, but the big point I want to make is if someone pays you a ransom, namely Jesus forfeiting his life on earth, them he couldn't legally take it back could he?

   "Hank,\n Your beliefs sounded like that of The Jesus Seminar. That's why I asked you if you had ever read anything by them.\n\n \n My beliefs were established long before the Jesus Seminar existed. But since the Jesus Seminar is made up of several different people, and there is no listing that I know of that states their beliefs, I'm not sure how you would know that.\n \n \n \n There was a special on ABC with John Dominic Crossan (and other liberal scholars) a few years back. I think it was titled The Real Jesus. ABC is known for their presentation of poorly substantiated liberal Christianity as they recently presented a very poor piece of journalism with their show on The DaVinci Code.\n\n \n Is there some reason you think I care about ABC?\n \n \nHere are a couple of evaluations of the work of The Jesus Seminar:\n\n \n I noticed at least one of your links indicated that scholars of the New Testament in general agreed that the gospels were passed on by oral tradition and translations that may not be exactly right but were what God wanted them to write. This statement boils down to basically a statement of belief that the Bible is correct in general because there is not proof based on evidence.\n \n I only brought up the Jesus Seminar to show that there were those that are highly educated in this area that state that the gospels are not the 'exact' words of Jesus. I certainly realize that there is a wide range of beliefs about the gospels. But you continue to imply that because it says that Jesus said something in the gospels then it must be true. I'm pointing out that not only do I not think that, but others, including some experts in the field think that also.\n \n Now common sense would tell someone that something that was passed on by word of mouth for decades after Jesus died, then written down in a different language than what Jesus spoke, would not be the exact words that Jesus spoke. Especially if you know that the person doing the writing was biased towards that person. Then you have those originals copied over and over for 150 years while the theology was being developed, with the opportunity to modify those writings to fit with the desired theology. I'm just not clear on how you would expect most people to just accept that under those circumstances that the gospels ended up being the exact words of Jesus.\n \n \nYou should really try to read the books I suggested--not just skim. The Everlasting Man is the most profound work of the three--the best book on Christianity I have ever read. Mere Christianity is probably the shortest and easiest read (yet still profound). The Case for Christ is the most modern of the three.\n\n \n For some reason you continue to think that books written by fallible humans are going to have more of an impact on me than the Holy Spirit. Can you give me a reason why I should listen to them instead of the Holy Spirit?",

   "To All,\n At the outset of my postings I made it clear that my aim was to, using the Bible, counter the false teaching regarding the Christ, which I hope I am doing in a fair and just way. I would again like to make it clear that it is not my intention to destroy the love that these people clearly have for God and for the Bible, but IT IS FAIR from the standpoint of God that he has his people recognise him for what he says he is and not what people want him to be. He is also very clear that the scriptures are the only place to look for the answer, ?From infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for SETTING THINGS STRAIGHT, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.? (2 Timothy 3:15-17)\n\n \n This is simply false on two parts. Firstly, you don't just quote scripture, you quote the Watchtower.\n \n Secondly, and this is annoying, you ignore questions I give you. I asked you about your claim that the Trinity was unknown to the Early Church (but here you just say 'the early church as recorded in the Bible :) and also, where did Jesus predict the coming of Charles Taze Russell? (That Jesus made no mention that the Bible's word would be misunderstood for more than 1,800 years)\n \n However, onto authority of the Bible v Holy Tradition\n John 21\n 25\n \"Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.\"\n In other words, the Bible doesn't cover everything.\n \n ?Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you? (I Corinthians 11:2)\n \n ?Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught,  whether by word or our epistle?\n (II Thessalonians 2:15)\n \n ?We command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received from us? (II Thessalonians 3:6).\n \n They said these things, because Tradition was the first means by which Christ's message was transmitted to us.\n \n \nMontalban, I feel the discussion is sliding once again from the scriptures, I have to ask you, do you believe the 66 books of the bible to be the absolute authority from God in discussing who he is? - Keep in mind Rev. 22:18,19. Please let me know the answer to this question because this will prove a big juncture in our discussion.\n\n \n See below...\n \n\n I've given you ample quotes from\n a) the Bible\n b) Sts Ignatius and Clement\n c) The Didache\n Jesus is eternal\n Hebrews 13: 8\n Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Your argument is that everywhere we've got the Greek mixed up - we who compiled the Bible in Greek! In effect your argument is, that if you re-write the Bible your Bible interpretations are correct - because we hold true to the Orthodox dogmatic teaching that we've always held\n\n \n \nMy case to you is simple, part A, I will except, the rest are not Gods inspired word and that, scripturally speaking, the trinity is not found in the Bible, it can?t fit no matter how much it?s squeezed and moulded, as I have said before it reacts with the scriptures like nuclear fission, as is laid out below:\n\n \n Firstly, the trinity is found in the Bible. The word 'trinity' is not! The concept of the Trinity is!\n \n Secondly, the Bible simply can't be supreme authority because the Bible did not fall out of heaven fully written. The first members of the Church did not have the Bible. They relied on Holy Tradition. Holy Tradition came first, and it was on the basis of Holy Tradition that the Bible came from. What gave the Bible it's authority? Itself? No! A council (actually several) sat down with the many books floating around the Empire and determined which were true to the teachings of Christ (as handed down through Holy Tradition) and which were not.\n What happened to the Christians who didn't have a Bible because it hadn't existed yet? What authority did they use? The one we still rely on, \"Holy Tradition\"\n \n The following books were recognised as authoritative... (from the Appendix \"Canon of the New Testament\", p424 of \"The History of the Church\" by Eusebius)\n Matthew\n Mark\n Luke\n John\n Acts\n Thirteen Pauline Epistles\n 1 Peter\n 1 John\n 1 Clement\n There were disputed (but still included books)\n Hebrews\n James\n 2 Peter\n 2 and 3 John\n Jude\n Revelations\n and rejected books\n Peter's Gospel, Acts, Preaching, Revelation\n Paul's Acts\n Hemras' Shepherd\n Clement's Second Epistle\n Barrabas' Epistle\n Apostles Teachings\n Thomas' Gospel\n Matthias' Gospel\n Gospel of the Hebrews\n Acts of Andrew\n Acts of John\n \n You accept the judges decision, but not the judge!\n \n Next, you are in effect saying that Jesus made a massive mistake. Jesus commissioned His Apostles to preserve His teaching. You would have us believe that here He made an error, because they failed to do so... so badly in fact that more than 1,800 years went by before Charles Taze Russell set the record straight!\n \n Where did Jesus go so wrong... after-all He picked the 12. They failed as teachers, and here's another thing. You rely on the books of the Bible. The Bible for example has the Gospel of St Mark. St Mark followed St Peter around, and thus he was a student of Peter. So was St. Ignatius of Antioch. Somehow you have to contort an argument that Peter's teachings in St Mark's work are more valid than those in St. Ingatius' works.\n \n Further, you feel free to quote WBTS, so I feel free to quote from Church Fathers Look below, you quote WBTS again. I'm sure you'll say \"Yes, but they quote from the Bible.\" Well, so do the Church Fathers!\n \n \n?Should you believe in the Trinity? (WBTS)\n Those words are found at Deuteronomy 6:4. The Catholic New Jerusalem Bible (NJB) here reads: ?Listen, Israel: Yahweh our God is the one, the only Yahweh.? In the grammar of that verse, the word ?one? has no plural modifiers to suggest that it means anything but one individual.\n\n \n So, God as in Genesis is plural.\n \n \nWhat other mistakes have been made in interpretations?\n Resurrection of the Men of Sodom\n 1879 - They will be resurrected.\n 1952 - They will not be resurrected.\n 1965 - They will be resurrected.\n 1988 - They will not be resurrected.24\n The 'Lord' in Romans 10:12-16\n 1903 - 'Lord' refers to Jesus.\n 1940 - 'Lord' refers to Jehovah.\n 1978 - 'Lord' refers to Jesus.\n 1980 - 'Lord' refers to Jehovah.25\n 'Higher Powers' of Romans 13:1\n 1916 - 'Higher powers' refers to governments.\n 1943 - 'Higher powers' refers to Jehovah God & Jesus Christ.\n 1964 - 'Higher powers' refers to governments.26\n Separating 'sheep and goats' (Matt. 25:31-46)\n 1919 - will take place after the time of tribulation.\n 1923 - is taking place now, before the tribulation.\n 1995 - will take place after the tribulation.27\n http://www.irr.org/English-JW/jwfacten.html \n\n \n \n \nOne must say that these accusations are fascinating I never heard some of them before (and I?ve heard lots) very well researched, but it must be said that they in no way prove the Trinity. However be careful, people may see that your trying to be very underhand. God would like us to stick with the scriptures.\n\n \n They don't prove the Trinity. True..\n \n As pointed out at the beginning, you quote from the Watchtower all the time. Therefore, as you've entered into the debate as evidence, I can test it as a source of authority. Quite clearly it has failed because it has continually made mistakes with regards to prophecy (many and obviously false claims that the world would end at various dates, and as just stated above, many re-interpretations of scripture - from a man who didn't understand Greek).\n \n ?.. .knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit? (II Peter 1:20-21).\n \n Your church is man-made. Mine was founded at Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came to the Apostles.\n \n In other words it goes to the validity of your sources. Your witness is discredited. Next witness.\n \n \n As to your question about the Church... what is it you want to ask? \n\n \n \nIs there a prophecy in the Bible that says something about Apostasy concerning the establishment? \n\n \n I don't understand the question.\n \n In a summary...\n \n You believe the truth of the Bible, but not of the people who put it together... so somehow the truth of the Bible slipped through some evil net. That even when it was not yet in written form, it was somehow maintained by these evil men. Some how, even though Acts of the Apostles shows the early formation of a real and visible church; deacons, priests, bishops... that they failed.\n \n Secondly, the proper interpretation of the Bible was not undertaken until more than 1,800 years later, evading all the great religious thinkers of that epoch, until suddenly in America, a man with no understanding of Greek, was somehow able to fathom something. Outstanding.\n \n \nThe NWTL was translated in the 50's. Russel died in 1916! How does his Greek come into play?\n\n \n It does because Charles Taze Russell, and other JWs believe that everyone else is using the wrong Bible. He claimed to go back to the original Greek, and read it correcting our 'errors'. Later in court, he was challenged and admitted that he didn't understand it.\n \n \n We don't need Russel to be right.\n\n \n You do, if you want to wrest the claim of authority from our church. How is it that you can believe in a man's interpretation of the Bible when he was consistently wrong?\n \n \nMontalban do you even understand the concept of different religions?\n\n \n This has no discernable point. However you go on to say I'm Greek Orthodox. I made no such claim. I am Orthodox. The one Orthodox Church is divided simply for administrative purposes into Greek, Serbian, Russian, Antiochian, Syrian, etc.\n \n \nWe have been doing this dance with Trinitarians for a long time. We have a solid case. We have already made up our minds before we met you, and we know a lot about our own religion.\n\n \n Which came first?\n \n \nFor some reason you are coming on as if we don't know why we have our beliefs, that we belief the same thing you do, but have been lied to. Here comes Montalban to save the day and straighten out what Jehovah?s Witness should believe. It is not meant to offend you, but you seem out of touch. It could be a cultural thing, and I just misunderstand you.\n\n \n Out of touch? This is a bizarre statement to make. Effectively you are a new group with a new understanding of Scripture. Your authority for interpretation is self-appointed. You are a man-made church.\n \n \nAs for predictions. What about fatima. The pope claimed that the last prediction happened. Do you remember when he was shot with an arrow?\n\n \n Are you starting another thread, or, as I believe, you have mixed up Orthodoxy with Catholicism?\n \n \nWe have more members because they are not going to heaven. I thought I answered that sorry if I forgot.\n\n \n Yes, but where are they now? (Those that have died) You believe some will go to heaven, but most will literally 'inherit the earth'. So those not gone to heaven, but are designed to inherit the earth - where are they now?\n You believe 144,000 will get to heaven, based on Revelations despite the fact that this book clearly says that they are all of the tribes of Israel, and a male, and are virgins!",

   "Montalban,\n It seems to me the only way that you can approach the question \"is there a trinity\" is from a non-Biblical standpoint, all the verses that Trinitarians supply are simply read into further that what they should be (clearly), simply trying to prove something that you already hold as fact, is a very BIG mistake, with this attitude you could make God out to be whatever you want, and not what he clearly tells us he is. You are ignoring warnings not from me but from God, so I will restate them to you just for clarity, Rev 22:18 \"if anyone makes an addition to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written..\" I've said it before and I'll say it again, if there was any question regarding who God was or what he was like you should never look outside the scriptures to try to find it. The scriptures are complete enough for us to do this otherwise he couldn't say in 2Tim. \"All scripture is inspired by God.... for Setting things straight\" and if as you say there not than this would be a direct assault on Gods ability to preserve a mere book down through the ages. Job 42:2 says that God is \"able to do all things\" the preceding chapters talk of his unmatchable knowledge as regards the creation, something far more brain stretching than protecting a book. \n \n It was foretold a great apostasy would sweep through the Christian establishment.\n 2 Thess. 2:3: \"Let no one seduce you in any manner, because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness gets revealed, the son of destruction.\"\n 1 Tim. 4:1: \"The inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons.\"\n 2 Pet. 2:1, 3: \"There will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them . . . Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words.\"\n Acts 20:30: \"From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.\"\n It was evident that this apostasy had already started before the last of the Apostles died (1John 2:18), the same kind of apostasy that was plaguing the Jewish nation at the arrival of Jesus, when most of the Jews of that time were simply in darkness as to the truth from the scriptures regarding Jesus. This same apostasy was to engulf pure worship once again. These too had added tradition (unsriptually) to the law, which Jesus clearly rebuked. So its very important also that if traditions are to be held and handed down they must in no way conflict with Gods inspired word. (See bottom of post). These very important scriptural warnings do not seem to indicate that we should look outside the scriptures to find proof of a triune God, do they? Your whole case has no scriptural authority!!!\n \n The very mere fact that the whole trinity thing is called into question shows that we need to turn to God for the answers, not to the additional teachings of mere men. It is so important that this question is answered correctly because it is fundamental for our salvation as recorded at Dan. 11:32 which says; \"But as regards the people that are knowing their God, they will prevail and act effectively....and as regards those having insight among the people, they will impart understanding to the many.\" Also Dan. 12:8, 10; \"what will be the final part of all the things?.......Go Daniel because the words are made secret and sealed up until the time of the end. Many will cleanse themselves and whiten themselves and will be refined.... But the ones having insight will understand.\" Compare this with Isaiah 2:2 which says; \"And it must occour in the final part of the days that the mountain of the house of the LORD will become firmly established above the tops of the mountains.... And to it all nations must stream.\" So clear is the Bible that only in the final part of the days would the true knowledge from the scriptures become so abundant that all those who want it can have it. What I think you are trying to say that your church could survive down through one of the most turbulent ages in history with no apostasy creeping in, no false traditions, no false teachings, no scriptural uncleanness whatsoever. This would be an amazing feat to say the least, the most long lasting obedient organization that almighty God has ever owned (compared with Israel) wow! Think about what your saying, God never said that would be the case. If what you say is true and your church has a direct root with the apostles then it simply didn't remain that way as fortold.\n \n So you see there is no authority on teaching outside of the scriptures, something that Jehovah's Witnesses adhere to so dearly, nothing added nothing taken away. \n \n Quotes 'The Watchtower 1st December 1995,\n Test the Traditions\n In view of the dangers involved in blindly following traditional beliefs and customs, what should we do? Toward the end of the first century, the apostle John gave this advice to his fellow Christians: \"Beloved ones, do not believe every inspired expression, but test the inspired expressions [just as you would test water for purity] to see whether they originate with God, because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.\" (1 John 4:1; see also 1 Thessalonians 5:21.) How do you know whether a tradition is harmful? You need some kind of authority, some standard of purity, to test what you believe.\n The Bible is such an authority. Jesus Christ stated: \"Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.\" (John 17:17) He also said: \"The hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth.\" (John 4:23) By using God's inspired Word, you get to the pure waters of truth rather than the polluted waters of human and demonic philosophy.-John 8:31, 32; 2 Timothy 3:16.\n Remember, even minute amounts of pollutants can have dire consequences. Sometimes it takes years before the effects show up. \"Dirty water,\" says Shridath Ramphal, former president of the World Conservation Union, \"has become the world's most dangerous killer. At least twenty-five thousand people die every day from their use of it.\" Spiritually contaminated traditions are even more dangerous.\n Do you have the courage to break free from traditional beliefs that you may have followed for years if it turns out that they conflict with the truth? Heed the warnings. Protect yourself and your family by making sure that your traditions harmonize with God's pure Word of truth.-Psalm 19:8-11; Proverbs 14:15; Acts 17:11.",

   "Richard I noticed something else. Some of the people that Montalban will claim to be Trinitarians are not. For the modern trinity that he believes in is in conflict with some of the writings of the bishops he is quoting. I am not calling conspiracy and I think that Montalban is earnest, but I think that his beliefs are based on scholarly cannibalism and spiritual conquest by grabbing every non-heretic in the first century then retroactively baptizing them orthodox, couching their words, or totally forging documents in the middle ages. The most if not all of the \"bishops\" were true Christians, but because their works are not canon they are almost akin to the apocryphal books of the bible. Anyone can claim the bishop wrote something and believe thus and so.\n \n Modern JWs don't put faith in anything but God's word, and are always skeptical of non biblical documents because they are as Montalban says \"man-made\". The watchtower even warns of things written by Jehovah's Witnesses. If we are skeptical of our own writings then it is natural for us to be skeptical of others. I notice Montalban keeps Bringing up Pastor Russell. I think I know what he is getting at. Do you have a 1928 November 15 and December 1 copy of the watchtower to set him straight?",

(2Thess. 2:3)\n \n \nso somehow the truth of the Bible slipped through some evil net. That even when it was not yet in written form, it was somehow maintained by these evil men.\n\n \n Something that is still clearly evident today (2Thess. 4:4)\n \n \n Some how, even though Acts of the Apostles shows the early formation of a real and visible church; deacons, priests, bishops... that they failed.\n\n \n Eventually! Yes! Again according to the Bible (2Peter 2:1)\n \n \nSecondly, the proper interpretation of the Bible was not undertaken until more than 1,800 years later,\n\n \n Lets clear something up, True Christians today follow the example of the True Christians in the first century (Gal. 5:22)\n \n \nevading all the great religious thinkers of that epoch, until suddenly in America, a man with no understanding of Greek, was somehow able to fathom something. Outstanding.\n\n \n Yes, eventually someone was willing to approached the Bible with no preconceived ideas and with a humble heart willing to accept only what the Bible said, and someone who didn't try to tell the Bible what to say. However it was not totally mastered even by him, there was still a lot more work to do, clearly a refining work has been taking place ever since (Dan. 12:10) It can be said that today there is an organisation that has absolutely listened to what the Bible has to say, in effect God.\n \n \nAs pointed out at the beginning, you quote from the Watchtower all the time. Therefore, as you've entered into the debate as evidence, I can test it as a source of authority. Quite clearly it has failed because it has continually made mistakes with regards to prophecy (many and obviously false claims that the world would end at various dates, and as just stated above, many re-interpretations of scripture - from a man who didn't understand Greek).\n\n \n Why attack an organization that will speedily admit that it has been wrong, in order to disprove it's present scriptural teachings. You sound like a politician. emoticon_emb \n \n \nNext, you are in effect saying that Jesus made a massive mistake. Jesus commissioned His Apostles to preserve His teaching. You would have us believe that here He made an error, because they failed to do so... so badly in fact that more than 1,800 years went by before Charles Taze Russell set the record straight!\n\n \n NO! Jesus achieved his goal, he (Jesus) established an organization that would eventually become global, although it fell into deep apostasy as foretold, it would recover as foretold in the final part of the days (Isa. 2:2) so the goal has now been achieved (almost Matt. 24:14) as foretold. Isn't the Bible fantastic. Remain in the word of God and it all becomes so clear John 8:31, 17:17-20, Think this through!!\n \n Much love...",

   "\n Montalban,\n It seems to me the only way that you can approach the question \"is there a trinity? is from a non-Biblical standpoint, all the verses that Trinitarians supply are simply read into further that what they should be (clearly), simply trying to prove something that you already hold as fact, is a very BIG mistake, with this attitude you could make God out to be whatever you want, and not what he clearly tells us he is. You are ignoring warnings not from me but from God, so I will restate them to you just for clarity, Rev 22:18 ?if anyone makes an addition to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written..? I?ve said it before and I?ll say it again, if there was any question regarding who God was or what he was like you should never look outside the scriptures to try to find it. The scriptures are complete enough for us to do this otherwise he couldn?t say in 2Tim. ?All scripture is inspired by God?. for Setting things straight? and if as you say there not than this would be a direct assault on Gods ability to preserve a mere book down through the ages. Job 42:2 says that God is ?able to do all things? the preceding chapters talk of his unmatchable knowledge as regards the creation, something far more brain stretching than protecting a book. \n\n \n It may comfort you to make such misleading statements and show lack of insight into your own thought processes.\n \n Let's look at this, see if you can keep up\n I quote Bible verse\n You quote Bible verse\n I state my church's interpretation of Bible verse\n You state the Watchtower's interpretation of Bible verse\n \n ONLY, you seem to think that I'm constantly going outside the Bible to back up the idea of the Trinity, (whereas you keep doing it wiht the Watchtower, only you think that this is okay; to reference Scripture to a particular interpretaion, but not for me to do the same). Then you have the gall to keep telling me that I'm not using the Bible as a rerference, when you yourself introduced the argument that the Early Church had no notion of the Trinity. You are the one who made this criticism, so I quoted people from the Early Church, viz St Clement of Rome and St Ignatius of Antioch, both of whom were taught by the Apostles. Then you again have the gall to say that I'm only relying on them, and shouldn't. I am defending against a silly statement you made. I have shown that these Early Church men did believe in the Trinity.\n \n The Didache, written well before many of the Bible's books were written down, tells us to do things in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n \n This leaves us in a dead-lock, unltess we can look to those doing the interpretation.\n My church compiled the Bible and was founded by God, through the Holy Spirit at Pentecost\n Your church was founded more than 1,800 years later by a man who tried to comit pergury in court.\n Jesus foretold that the Holy Spirit would come to guide His hand-picked men.\n How was Charles Taze Russell chosen/foretold?\n \n \n \n It was foretold a great apostasy would sweep through the Christian establishment.\n 2 Thess. 2:3: ?Let no one seduce you in any manner, because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness gets revealed, the son of destruction.?\n 1 Tim. 4:1: ?The inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons.?\n 2 Pet. 2:1, 3: ?There will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them . . . Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words.?\n\n \n And it happened. It's called the Protestant Reformation; to which it continues with your church today. You have broken away from the Church Jesus established.\n \n Not only did the Bible predict false prophets, but it also said that the Church Jesus would establish, would continue to prevail, that even hell won't stand against it. That Church has continued from Pentecost, to our own time. This is why you believe Jesus has failed, because even though He predicted that His church would continue, you believe that it all fell into Apostasy, only to be resurrected (against Biblical Scripture) some 1,800 years later.\n \n Jesus told Peter that his faith would endure...\n Matthew 16:18\n And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock [of faith] I will build my church, and the gates of Hades[ 16:18 Or hell] will not overcome it.[ 16:18 Or not prove stronger than it]\n \n Peter and the other Apostles established the Chuch, and their faith endures to this day.\n \n \n Acts 20:30: ?From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.?\n\n \n True. Which is why we rely on the authority of the whole church, not on any one man; like you do. We have Church Councils, the same ones that gave YOU the Bible in the first place.\n \n \n It was evident that this apostasy had already started before the last of the Apostles died (1John 2:18), the same kind of apostasy that was plaguing the Jewish nation at the arrival of Jesus, when most of the Jews of that time were simply in darkness as to the truth from the scriptures regarding Jesus. This same apostasy was to engulf pure worship once again. These too had added tradition (unsriptually) to the law, which Jesus clearly rebuked. So its very important also that if traditions are to be held and handed down they must in no way conflict with Gods inspired word. (See bottom of post). These very important scriptural warnings do not seem to indicate that we should look outside the scriptures to find proof of a triune God, do they? Your whole case has no scriptural authority!!!\n\n \n Yes, Simon Magus is one. That is why St. Paul is constantly telling us not to break away from the Church. It is because within the Church, the truth still lives. Charles Taze Russell is another false prophet. You will know the tree by the fruit it bears, and Russell's false message has been shown to you; he'd made numerous predictions about when the world would end.\n \n That is why Peter cried out \"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation...\" (2 Peter 1:20-21), which you should keep in mind with reference to Charles Taze Russell.\n \n \n \n The very mere fact that the whole trinity thing is called into question shows that we need to turn to God for the answers, not to the additional teachings of mere men.\n\n \n This is not true. The Trinity is not additional teaching. I have already shown you scripture that tells you this. And note again the Scripture from the Bible above re: personal interpretation. The Bible warns you against this. Why do you ignore Acts of the Apostles, is beyond me. When someone found faith, what happened? They called on the Apostles (or those they had appointed) to go an baptise them. They didn't baptise themselves. Finding faith was not enough.\n \n \n So you see there is no authority on teaching outside of the scriptures, something that Jehovah?s Witnesses adhere to so dearly, nothing added nothing taken away. \n\n \n This simply is not true. You've changed your mind on what Scriptures mean more than a dozen times.\n \n \n Do you have the courage to break free from traditional beliefs that you may have followed for years if it turns out that they conflict with the truth? Heed the warnings. Protect yourself and your family by making sure that your traditions harmonize with God?s pure Word of truth.?Psalm 19:8-11; Proverbs 14:15; Acts 17:11.\n\n \n Jesus lived a Liturgical life. He instituted sacraments. We draw our sacraments from His life; baptism, and the Eucharist (from the Last Supper). You would have me ignore the life of Jesus, who is the example for us all.\n \n Do you take part in the Eucharist? You don't even recognise your place of worship as a 'church'. Where is \"Meeting Hall\" in the Bible?\n \n The Sacrament of the Eucharist was established by Jesus.\n \n Matthew 26\n 26\n While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take and eat; this is my body.\" \n 27\n Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, \"Drink from it, all of you.\n 28\n This is my blood of the[2] covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n \n This is thus grounded in the Bible. The Early Church believed it was true; the Didache mentions the Eucharist. In fact, so strong was the belief, that pagans mistook the Sacrament as cannibalism\n \n \"Christian beliefs and practices were misunderstood, with rumors spreading that they were cannibalistic (\"Take and eat; this is my body broken for you\" = Eucharist),\"\n http://www.libertymagazine.org/article/articleview/214/1/34/\n \n Thus my church's interpretation is based on the Bible; it's continued through non-Biblical books; and pagans too have shown that the Early Church believed in the Eucharist as the actual Body of Christ, so much so, that they mistook it for cannibalism. You church has gone against the teachings of the Bible, and the Early Church",

He wasn't of 'humble heart' who didn't totally master Greek. He was a person who in court couldn't even identify which letters of the alphabet were which. We're talking the absolute basics of understanding Greek. Beware of false prophets. No matter how you want to twist it the facts remain your interpretation of the original texts is based on someone who couldn't read them in the original... hence all the mistakes he's made.\n \n \nWhy attack an organization that will speedily admit that it has been wrong, in order to disprove it?s present scriptural teachings. You sound like a politician.\n\n \n Because\n a) you introduce the Watchtower as evidence, therefore I'm allowed to test it for authenticity - and it's failed repeatedly\n b) ye shall no the tree by the fruit it bears - it has been wrong so often, because it is a man-made institution. You prefer to believe a fallible man-made system, rather than the infallible Church established by God.\n \n \nNext, you are in effect saying that Jesus made a massive mistake. Jesus commissioned His Apostles to preserve His teaching.

Isn?t the Bible fantastic. Remain in the word of God and it all becomes so clear John 8:31, 17:17-20, Think this through!!\n\n \n You should think this through.\n \n Jesus established a Church through His Apostles, whom He taught for 3 years. He promised them that false prophets would attempt to go against them, but none would prevail. These Apostles continued to teach down to our present age... as Jesus foretold; the church prevails. The Apostles taught others, such as St. Mark, whom you rely on, but not Sts. Clement and Ignatius - why you rely on one but not the others, you've not said.\n \n Without foretelling, a man who did not understand the original texts, named Charles Taze Russell, comes along pretending to know these original Greek texts, to discern a meaning that was not taught in the previous 1,800 years; to change the idea of God that the early church taught. He took away the Eucharist (despite the fact that this was ordained by Jesus at the Last Supper; and known to the Early Church as evidenced by the Didache; and the various pagans who misunderstood it as a literal cannibalism; there-by showing that they did in fact believe it to be the Body of Christ. Yes, Russell took away the Eucharistic celebration, despite the warnings in the Bible not to diminish or to add on anything.\n \n He then claims that the Church Jesus founded is wrong, and that he personally is correct in his own personal interpretation, despite the Bible saying that we shouldn't rely on personal interpretation (see 2 Peter 1:20-21). Further, despite being a single individual, who's made a mountain of mistakes in interpretation, you somehow believe that he is right, and that the body of the Church founded by God is wrong.\n \n Think of the implications. Think of the warnings Jesus made about false prophets. Think of an organisation that has continually misrepresented the Bible, and therefore makes mistakes, as you and XQsThaiPoes admit. Compare that to the un-erring God-founded Church that has existed since the times of Christ.\n \n Post226\n \nSome of the people that Montalban will claim to be Trinitarians are not. For the modern trinity that he believes in is in conflict with some of the writings of the bishops he is quoting.

The most if not all of the \"bishops\" were true Christians, but because their works are not canon they are almost akin to the apocryphal books of the bible. Anyone can claim the bishop wrote something and believe thus and so.\n \n\n \n I am starting to be annoyed by your argument style; making such a vapid statement like that is hardly worthy of you. Please, please, please back up your argument with facts. Show me\n a) what my 'modern' belief in the Trinity is\n b) how this is in dispute by the Church Fathers\n c) what documents were forged in the Middle Ages\n d) which non-Canonical works are YOU talking about? After-all, we recognise as cannon, non-biblical texts, whereas your fellow JW, Richard's argument has been in part based on the fact that I do go to sources that are extra-Biblical. (please co-ordinate your arguments).\n \n You continually make such grandiose statements without recourse to backing it up.\n Also, if they are non-heretical, then they are part of my church. Show me which were non-Orthodox, then later made Orthodox.\n \n You have in such a short passage produced such a bunch of misrepresentations. I at lease, when I'm critical of Charles Taze Russell, back up my claims. I expect from you either a recanting of the above points, or a more fuller dissertation, actually including facts and not opinion.s\n \n \nModern JWs don't put faith in anything but God's word...\n \n\n \n What other kind are there? Your church isn't old enough to have a 'classical period' :)\n \n Post 220\n \nAs for Ignatius I have not read his letters first hand. They don't have a \"trinity\" in them. Some of his works state Jesus was created, subjugates the Holy Spirit and Jesus, and declares there is one Father whom is God of the universe. I have a few quotes from him, but I don't have the source material in hard copy to back it up. Yes he was a first generation Jew. \n\n \n Again, look at the pattern you argue...\n Which of his works state Jesus was created?\n \n If you want to continue to make such sweeping allegations, then you are not interested in discussion, but dictation.\n \n \nThere are 15 letters by him and scholars disagree on which ones are real, and which versions of the agreed ones are real. So if I say he does not support the trinity I am sure you will produce a version or letter that does. Then the debate will turn to if he actually wrote it. I don't want to go there.\n\n \n This is simply not true. Of the extant letters the only serious dispute* is from a discovery \"in 1845 Dr. Cureton discovered a Syriac text of a collection of three epistles, Ephesians, Romans, and Polycarp, and there was for a time a tendency to think that this might be the original text. \"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/ignatius-intro.html\n And we have those texts to compare.\n \n \n \nEventually the over-crowding would make the Earth not worth while.\n\n \n Post 218\n \nAdam and Eve was not supposed to die, and God tells them to fill the earth.\n\n \n They weren't supposed to die, but they did. Therefore, when they were told to fill the earth, do you think that God planned that they would keep reproducing for infinity? That's what you propose. After judgment, some will go to heaven. Some more will inherit the earth, and live there forever, eventually, filling up the entire planet... What then?\n \n \n *I say serious, because your specious falsifying belief would work if you could find a single objection. When you ignore that there are objections to the very Bible, that it is genuine.\n \n \n \n How many Christian denominations say that they are strictly 'bible-based'?",

Yes you posted some archaeological evidence and analysis. I have no trouble believing the Bible is accurate historically for the most part. In other words I have not problem believing the Jews went in committed genocide against rival tribes. Or that Joseph was sold into slavery. Or that Daniel existed. But when they say God told them to commit that genocide, or Noah built an ark for a global flood, or Jesus was born of a virgin, or that it is the literal word of God, then I don&#8217;t believe that for a minute. Your archaeological evidence shows some natural things really did happen. It doesn&#8217;t show that Bible is the word of God. When it can't even be proved whether there is a God or not, it sure can't be proven that a book is the word of that God.",

   "Hank, if I read your posts correctly, you say that you don't believe in the Bible and that you just go by what Jesus says.\n \n Let's see what Jesus has to say.\n \n Luk 24:27 And beginning from Moses, and from all the prophets, He explained to them the things about Himself in all the Scriptures. \n \n Luk 24:44 And He said to them, These are the Words which I spoke to you yet being with you, that all the things must be fulfilled having been written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, concerning Me.\n \n Mat 12:39 But answering, He said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet. Mat 12:40 And even as \"Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights,\" so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. cf. Jon. 1:17 \n \n Mat 24:37 But as the days of Noah*, so also will be the coming of the Son of Man. \n \n *Gen 6:13 And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them. And behold, I will destroy them along with the earth. \n \n Mat 10:15 Truly I say to you, It will be more bearable to the land of Sodom* and Gomorrah in Judgment Day than for that city. \n \n *Gen 19:24 And Jehovah rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah, from Jehovah out of the heavens. \n \n Joh 2:18 Then the Jews answered and said to Him, What sign do You show to us, since You do these things? \n Joh 2:19 Jesus said to them, [B]Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will raise it up.[B] \n Joh 2:20 Then the Jews said, This sanctuary was forty six years being built, and do You raise it up in three days? \n Joh 2:21 But He spoke about the sanctuary of His body. \n Joh 2:22 Then when He was raised from the dead, His disciples recalled that He said this to them. And they believed the Scripture, even the Word that Jesus spoke. \n \n There is much more, but I believe I have given you evidence that Jesus Christ \n quoted from the Old Testament. Refuse this then you have refused the Teachings-sayings of Him.\n\n \n You have stated what the Bible says that Jesus said. You haven't given any evidence that Jesus said that.\n \n You take certain books that the church selected from a group of books and say this is what Jesus said. I take parts of what those books say that Jesus said and say this is what Jesus said. We both pick and chose but I pick based on what the Holy Sprit tells me. You pick based on what the church tells you.",

   "I answerd your question Hank. My statement was that God is speaking to you all of the time, everywhere, in every circumstance, in all people. The question is not IF he is speaking to you but What is He saying. \n\n \n Okay then since people say different and sometimes opposite things, I have to interpret what God is saying to me. So I&#8217;m right back to where I started. I use the Holy Spirit to interpret what God is telling me. So what&#8217;s your point?\n \n \nSay that Montalban says something that gets your goat IE Calls you a liar. This is one I have actually seen you say. (Odd to say SEEN to describe say). The question is, Why does this bother you so much? Why is it that an anonymous person from the other side of the globe that you will likely never meet has the power to XXXX you off? This is what God is saying, I believe. He does it to all of us if we will just listen. This is how the HS operates. The Psalms describe \"a still small voice.\" What is it about you that allows you to become upset at such a thing. If you were confident that you are not a liar and that you were above board on everything and that you were perfectly acceptable then this wouldn't bother you.\n\n \n Hey I agree with almost everything you said. I don&#8217;t think that every time someone gets upset, it&#8217;s because they have done something wrong, but I wholeheartedly agree with you that it needs to be examined. I know I wasn&#8217;t trying to deceive monty. My Dad was about as strict as they come when it came to lying. And for that reason, I react if someone catches me off guard. If I even think about lying for some reason I think might cover some minor mistake, I have to rub my rear end. I admitted he caught me off guard and I reacted to it. And for that reason, I did give it some major thought. I actually thought the same thing about you when you reacted to Richard the way you did.\n \n \nNow I know I used an example, but it is meant to be more of a hypothetical thing than for you to consider yourself, because, frankly, I don't know you. But others do. This is the leading of the holy spirit. This is God. He is here in me to make me more like Jesus. That is what I believe and how I want to live. I don't do it perfectly but that is the struggle of life.\n\n \n Same here and I agree with you. I wish I lived as well as I know to live.\n \n \nHave fun.\n\n \n I try, and often do. :)",

Faith alone was not enough.\n \n \n In fact, the very name \"Acts of the Apostles\" not \"Faith of the Apostles\" tells you something. If faith were alone, then the Bible would have finished at the time Christ rose into heaven; instead it goes on to show what the Apostles did; they taught, they organised, they conferred the gifts of the Holy Spirit upon people.",

That is why you continually make the use of illogic in two statements;\n a) your interpretation is correct, when it's been shown to be faulty\n b) we don't use the Bible, when in fact people have been quoting it for days now.\n \n You are blind to these things, even though they are right before your eyes.\n \n You claimed that God planted a lesser god into Mary (Matt. 1:18.). It in fact says...\n \"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit\"\n There's no inference of a lesser god here at all. The full personage of Jesus, God and human, was conceived by Mary and the Holy Spirit.\n \n You have added meaning to the text.\n \n Matthew 11\n 15\n He who has ears, let him hear. \n \n \n  Biblical \n \n Colossians 1\n 19\n For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him\"\n \n That is, He (Jesus) contains everything that is God (the Father). They are equal. They are equal because they are of the same substance, and are the same essence. They are the same being.\n \n Thus...\n I John 5\n 7\n There are those that bear record in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one\n \n Jesus is eternal\n Hebrews 13\n 8\n Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. \n \n Jesus said...\n John 10\n 38\n But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.\" \n That is, they are of one accord\n \n John 5\n 21\n For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. \n \n That is, Jesus is equal to God, in that they act of one accord\n \n Colossians 1\n 19\n \"For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him\"\n \n Jesus has the power and wisdom of God...\n 1 Cor 1\n 24\n \"...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"\n \n Jesus Himself commanded us to act by the Trinity\n Matthew 28\n 19\n Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\n Because we call on them together.\n \n Which is why the Apostles addressed letter by reference to the three...\n 2 Corinthians 13\n 14\n May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.\n \n  Extra-Biblical \n Ignatius' Epistle to the Magnesians\n \"CHAPTER 7\n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n The unity of them is continually repeated...\n He opens his Epistle to the Philadelphians\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, to the church of God the Father and of Jesus Christ, which is in Philadelphia of Asia...\"\n by mentioning them together.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n Epistle to the Ephesians\n CHAPTER 5\n 5:1 For if I in a short time had such converse with your bishop, which was not after the manner of men but in the Spirit, how much more do I congratulate you who are closely joined with him as the Church is with Jesus Christ and as Jesus Christ is with the Father, that all things may be harmonious in unity.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n The Didache\n 7:1 But concerning baptism, thus shall ye baptise.\n 7:2 Having first recited all these things, baptise {in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit} in living (running) water.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html",

   "\"...often we have had an incomplete, and even an inaccurate, view of things.\" \n\n \n Then you are saying that God failed in His message by making things so complex that we stumble from failure to failure.\n \n \nJehovah's witnesses believe we are the \"true\" religion, but that we are wrong often.\n\n \n Most JWs don't believe they've got a 'religion'. But your 'true' religion has by your own admission been false a great many times. Why would God make a false religion His example to the world?\n \n \n1914 like I said before is numerology derived from Daniel. \"God used the prophet Daniel to prophesy that ?Messiah the Leader? would appear sixty-nine weeks of years after the going forth of the command to rebuild Jerusalem itself, which command was issued in 455*B.C.E. Therefore Messiah, God?s Anointed One, would be due to appear in 29*C.E. God also indicated that the Gentile domination of earth, as permitted by God, commencing in 607*B.C.E., would last for 2,520 years, ending therefore in 1914*C.E.?Dan. 9:24-27; 4:16, 23, 25, 32.\"\n\n \n Look at the context: (Daniel 9:1-19) Daniel is praying that God will deliver them from the Persians, who are the instrument of God's wrath, because the Israelites have sinned. The Persian menace ended well before Christ came. So when it talks of 'an anointed one' it doesn't mean the Messiah at all. Don't forget the Kings of Israel were anointed ones too! Where does it say the Messiah Jesus?\n \n What is a week of years, anyway? I've never heard the expression. I've read the verses you cite, and it says 69 sevens. That is 69 weeks. If you believe that the command went out in 455, then a few years later an 'anointed one' had come.\n \n How then do you come to the year 1914? What are the maths when I read Daniel it talks of sixes nine sevens and seventy sevens. It says 70 sevens, or weeks. 70 weeks is 490 weeks, or over a year and a bit. Daniel 4:16 talks of 6 years. You seem to have some extra connotation that I can't see.\n \n However, most importantly...\n Does the Bible say anything about Jesus coming invisibly in that year? I can't see that in the book of Daniel. I've looked for a notion of an invisible return. Whom did Jesus return too? Where is this idea based in the Bible?\n \n Recall too, that Jesus said quite clearly that the next time He will come to Earth, the whole world will know. He warned His Apostles. He said that people will say Jesus is in the desert or over in a city, but do not believe them, for when He returns everyone on Earth will know it. Therefore the invisible return of Jesus contradicts Jesus' own words! !\n \n You have to do a bit of mental gymnastics for your belief\n a) week-years mean something\n b) Jesus is this particular 'anointed one'\n c) that even if He did return in 1914, He's going against what He said in the New Testament, about His own return\n d) He came invisibly, when I can't find any Scriptural evidence you've present to suggest that is the way He would return.\n \n Also, what do you mean about a Gentile domination of the Earth beginning in 607BC? There were more Gentiles than Jews well before then, and the Jews only ever dominated their local area. Further, the Gentiles continue to dominate the earth well after 1914.",

It's funny that you didn't pick up on this before. Sorry too that you'd fail to answer the rest of the post.\n \n The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society published a book titled \"You Can Live Forever In Paradise On Earth\". On page 147 we read these words,\n \"In the same way, Christ's return does not mean that he literally comes back to this earth. Rather, it means that he takes Kingdom power toward this earth and turns his attention to it. He does not need to leave his heavenly throne and actually come down to earth to do this. As we have seen in the previous chapter, Bible evidence shows that in the year 1914 C.E. God's time arrived for Christ to return and begin ruling. It was then that the cry was heard in heaven \"Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ.\" Revelation 12:10\n Of course, J.W.'s teach that Christ's return was invisible. They believe that Christ took \"kingdom power toward the earth\" and claim that \"God's time arrived for Christ to return and begin ruling\" in 1914. Mention of Christ's return is used at least seven times on page 147 of the above-mentioned Watchtower publication.\n http://www.macgregorministries.org/jehovahs_witnesses/1914.html\n \n Though some believe that this is when Satan was cast out of heaven.\n \n And you've no basis for this.\n \n And you've not even begun to address the maths issue. But, hey, ignore that too!\n \n \n See \"However, if the heavenly government was established in 1914, why is there all this distress on earth? It is Satan the Devil who is responsible. When Christ received Kingdom power, his first act was to wage war on Satan in the invisible heavens. \" \n http://www.watchtower.org/library/lmn/article_10.htm\n The offical JW site\n \n The Bible shows that the perfect government will be in heaven.

   "Okay the math. I knew I was going to have to do this one-day.\n\n \n Maths is my worst subject, so be patient.\n \n \nThe ?gentile times? started since he was not Jewish.\n\n \n If you mean Jesus, then you are simply wrong. Jesus was a practicing Jew - note that He was presented to the Temple, He taught in the Temple, and He engaged the other Jews in readings from Jewish Scripture.\n \n He obeyed Passover, celebrating the Last Supper at that time.\n \n If you're talking about Cornelius, then who is he? Not the chimpanzee-scientist from \"Planet of the Apes?\"\n \n Last posting you said that the Gentiles would rule up till 1914. They are still ruling.\n \n \nThere you have it the numbers match, but there is a ton of crisscrossing. \n\n \n You betchya you do. That's why I said you have a contorted theology, how you got from Daniel to Revleations and then back to another book, I've no idea.\n \n I still can't see how you get the figure 2520. The Book of Daniel says two sets of figures.\n \n What is a week of years? This is a term you used in your previous post.\n \n Also, some scripture you take a week to be a week, but others you don't. Where is it that you are able to tell which to take and when?\n \n Why did God allow Satan to stay in heaven from the time of rebellion, until 1914?\n \n \nIn 1914 Satan is confined to the earth with his demons and the side effect is the First World War.\n\n \n This raises three lots of questions... How was it that Satan is responsible for this war? What role did he play?\n \n Where on earth is he? If Satan is confined to being on earth, that is... can you tell me where he is? New York, perhaps?\n \n Where in the Bible does it say that Satan has rule of the earth, for this particualr epoch? (Is this the 1,000 years of Satan?)\n \n \nNote we do have a unique view of heaven it is the native realm of spirit creatures not for humans. The humans allowed to exist there serve in the bureaucracy of the heavenly government. Heaven is right now is a Meta physical industrial-military complex tooling up for the war of Armageddon with Satan, but it is still not viewed as anthropomorphic tangible place. So coming into power and restoring rule in heaven is a far cry from establishing rule on earth.\n\n \n I understand that JWs believe that heaven is in a particular nebula.\n \n \nI know I left stuff out with the math I am sorry There are probably more scriptures I forgot to include.\n\n \n There'd have to be more scripture than this! There's still a lot of jumping about to do.\n \n You claimed twice now that it was the Book of Daniel that lead you to the year 1914, and Jesus' rule in heaven/upper atmosphere. You still haven't answered why you think it's Jesus mentioned in Daniel. Quite clearly you recognise that this is a prophecy in relation to the Babylonians, and the Temple. The 'annointed one' could have been any hero of Israel then that fought against Babylon and helped re-establish Israel/Judah\n \n How is Jesus ruling? Is He giving you laws/rules by which to live by at this moment?\n \n I can give you explanations based on the bible to prove that the world should end in the year 1000. I can show you people who have believed that the world would in in 2000, and in the 1600s. That is, if you pick a few verses from here, and a few from there, as you do. :)",

   "Wonder if we are going to continuing this I'm requesting of you the same I did of Maximus. That you look at the thread 'Am I Going to hell?' in the Religious section and read post #246 through #251 or even down to #266. That would save me a lot of retyping and it's not too long. Then if you still have questions, I'll be glad to answer them.\n \n Thanks, Hank\n\n \n I did read the posts. You gave me insight into your upbringing, you shared your heart, emotions and experience. I do not think lightly of that and I appreciate you. \n \n \nI began to think of God in the same way I thought of my Father. As a loving and caring spirit that only had my best interest at heart. Except that God did not have the faults my Father had. He was perfect and had perfect love. It was an immense relief to realize that I was not going to hell because there was no hell. This is why you saw me post the question 'If you are a parent, would you create a place of eternal torture for your children.' And all the reading I had done about different people in the Bible and different religions began to start making sense. They were all different, but they all had a central theme. God loves us and he wants us to treat others the same as he treats us. It wasn't complicated at all, in fact it was so simple it was hard to see.[\n\n \n You gave your reasons for your belief and used the analogy about a parent not torturing their child to God as a Father not sending His children to hell for disobedience. \n \n However, this is an appeal to pity. It, the parent-child argument does not fit the proposition of the matter of matter of hell. It is true that Jesus does NOT condemn-send anyone to hell. \n \n Joh 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone believing into Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. \n Joh 3:17 For God did not send His Son into the world that He might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. \n Joh 3:18 The one believing into Him is not condemned; but the one not believing has already been condemned, for he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God. \n Joh 3:19 And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness more than the Light, for their works were evil.\n \n The truth is, people condemn themselve for not believing in Jesus Christ. \n \n You may say, that was inserted by the Church to help authenticate their beliefs. So I ask you Hank, again, to provide the saying-teachings of Jesus that you believe to be authentic. \n \n It would thrill me to no end to believe that there isn't a Hell. That in the end, God would just forget everything that happened, a \"well, boys will be boys\" attitude. Personally, I'm not real fond of the idea that Jesus is THE WAY, THE TRUTH and THE LIFE and that no one comes to the Father EXCEPT through Him. But it's not my heaven..I don't get to pick and choose. Otherwise, I'd say \"well, so and so is a pretty good guy\", or \"She had good intentions\". But I'm not God. I don't make the rules. I cannot go by feelings or desires.\n \n 1Co 15:17 But if Christ has not been raised, your faith is foolish; you are still in your sins. \n 1Co 15:18 And then those that fell asleep in Christ were lost. \n 1Co 15:19 If we only have hope in Christ in this life, we are of all men most miserable.",

Do you not think that when JWs tell about the end-times that they are also scaring people?\n \n Anyway, you don't believe in hell, despite all the Biblical and extra-Biblical references to it.\n \n Matthew 5:22\n But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother[ 5:22 Some manuscripts brother without cause] will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,[ 5:22 An Aramaic term of contempt] ' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.\n \n Matthew 5:29\n If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.\n \n Matthew 5:30\n And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. \n \n Matthew 10:28\n Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\n \n Matthew 16:18\n And I tell you that you are Peter,[ 16:18 Peter means rock.] and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of  Hades[ 16:18 Or hell]  will not overcome it.[ 16:18 Or not prove stronger than it] \n \n Matthew 18:9\n And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of  hell.\n \n Matthew 23:15\n \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of  hell as you are.\n \n Matthew 23:33\n \"You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell? \n \n Mark 9:43\n If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell , where the fire never goes out.[ 9:43 Some manuscripts out, 44 where / \" 'their worm does not die, / and the fire is not quenched.'] \n \n Mark 9:45\n And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into  hell .[ 9:45 Some manuscripts hell, 46 where / \" 'their worm does not die, / and the fire is not quenched.'] \n \n Mark 9:47\n And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into  hell, \n \n Luke 12:5\n But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell . Yes, I tell you, fear him. \n \n Luke 16:23\n  In hell,[ 16:23 Greek Hades] where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. \n \n James 3:6\n The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. \n \n 2 Peter 2:4\n For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell,[ 2:4 Greek Tartarus] putting them into gloomy dungeons[ 2:4 Some manuscripts into chains of darkness] to be held for judgment; \n \n Indeed, its another case of JWs taking away from the Bible. Pastor Russell, the same one who couldn't read the original Greek? Obviously he couldn't because he missed all the references to hell.\n \n \n Some few extra-Biblical sources:\n St. Isaac the Syrian\n \"I also maintain that those who are punished in Gehenna (hell), are scourged by the scourge of love. Nay, what is so bitter and vehement as the torment of love?\"\n http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b24.en.life_after_death.07.htm\n That is to say, that hell is the removal from God's love. No greater torture could exist.\n \n God said to Moses: \"I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion? (Ex. 33, 19). The Apostle Paul, citing this Old Testament passage, concludes: \"Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills, He hardens? (Rom. 9, 18). It needs to be interpreted in Orthodox terms. How does God want to have mercy on one and want to harden another? Is there favouritism in God?\n According to the interpretation of (St) Theophylactus of Bulgaria, this is connected with the nature of man and not with God's action. St. Theophylactus says: \"Just as the sun softens the wax candle but hardens clay, not arbitrarily but because of the different materials of the wax candle and the clay: so also God is said to harden the clay heart of the Pharaoh\"11. Therefore the grace of God, that is to say His love, which will radiate to all, will work according to a man's spiritual condition. \n Ibid.\n \n Hank, and XQsThaiPoes, the 'compassion' argument doesn't stand up...\n \"1. The Argument from God?s Compassion. According to this argument, it is contrary to God?s nature to consign anyone to hell for ever. After all, what human father would ever divide his children into sheep and goats? What human bridegroom, even the most insanely jealous, would wish eternal torments on his bride? And even if some such could be found, what has this to do with God? Is He not perfect love, infinite mercy, unbounded compassion?\n \n The commonest answer to this very common perplexity is to say: God is not only perfect love, He is also perfect justice; and while in His love for mankind He wishes that all men should be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth (I Timothy 2.4), the fact remains that very many \"resist the truth\" (II Timothy 3.8), and so cannot be saved, becoming subject to the full severity of His justice. The satisfaction of justice is an absolute demand of the Divine Nature, not because God is a bloodthirsty tyrant seeking revenge in a human, fallen manner, - God is not subject to any human passion, - but because evil and injustice are utterly alien to His Nature. As Lactantius, the Emperor Constantine?s tutor, said: ?If God is not angry with the impious and unjust, then neither does He love the pious and the just.? Or, as St. John of Damascus puts it: \"A judge justly punishes one who is guilty of wrongdoing; and if he does not punish him he is himself a wrongdoer. In punishing him the judge is not the cause either of the wrongdoing or of the vengeance taken against the wrongdoer, the cause being the wrongdoer's freely chosen actions. Thus too God, Who saw what was going to happen as if it had already happened, judged it as if it had taken place; and if it was evil, that was the cause of its being punished. It was God Who created man, so of course he created him in goodness; but man did evil of his own free choice, and is himself the cause of the vengeance that overtakes him.\"\n http://www.romanitas.ru/eng/HeavenHell.htm",

If you are in oblivion, that's it.\n \n It's not a technicality therefore at all. It's quite clear people are punished. They are feeling.\n \n There's the story in the Bible about the man cast to hell...\n Luke 16\n 22\n \"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried.\n 23\n In hell,[1] where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.\n 24\n So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' \n \n He's conscious of his surrounds. It's just another part of the bible you have to ignore.\n \n How is this a 'technicality' when it's quite clear that he's suffering?

If he used an English translation, please let me know which one.\n \n You miss the point anyway. In Greek, as it was written, it was Hades; which is there name for the place you go when you die (even in Greek-pagan use, the people there were conscious). When they've translated it into English they haven't lost the meaning, because we can go back to the originals to check.\n \n \nHe did not take anything away. I would have to say we believe in hell just not the mythical hell that many christians do. You added torment and Dante added levels, and making the \"punishment fit the crime? such as flatterers standing in pools of excrement.\n\n \n Another misrepresenation. When you say 'many' you should be honest enough and say 'most'. It's not a myth if it's in the Bible, quite clearly.\n \n Pastor Charles Taze Russell did take away. He took away hell! How is it 'mythical'? How did 'I' add torment, when it's in the Biblical passages I cited?\n \n It is true Dante talked of hell. Tell me, is he a Church Father recongised by Orthodoxy? (He's not even recognised by the West, as far as I'm aware)\n \n Why do you think that I take notice of the ideas of hell as presented by a western, non-Church Holy Father?\n \n \nWhere is the Devil?\n Job 1\n 7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.\n\n \n That's past tense. That means Satan was on the earth. Remember the tempter in the Garden of Eden?\n \n \nRevelation 12\n 9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\n\n \n So where are they now? New York?\n \n \n1 Peter 5\n 8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:\n \n 2 Corinthians 11\n 14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.\n 15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.\n \n All KJV.\n \n He is here on earth and been dwelling here a long time, but now is stuck here. Satan is a spirit If he did decides to make him self visible he is a great liar I doubt you would know it was him for he may apper to be a noble good person.\n\n \n \n No, I want to know where is he now? Where is his dwelling? If he's confined to the earth, I expect you don't think he's leading a gypsy-like existence. You think he's some kind of peripatetic seraph.",

You need to draw an inference that is not apparent. This just says that their sons and daughters burn in a fire - so what?\n \n \nActs 2\n 31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.\n\n \n My version says...\n Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ,[6] that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. \n \n But regardless, you've not made any point again, just drawn up a random Biblical passage. All this refers to is what all Christians believe, that Jesus' body was not corrupted. Peter is simply proclaiming the risen Lord, who was not corrupted in the grave. Amen!\n \n \nAbraham was not in heaven. This goes against Jesus words.\n John 3\n 13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\n \n all from KJV.\n\n \n This is the only verse that you've presented that is the least bit problematic, and oddly enough, this is a passage of John that you and Richard do believe in literally.\n \n We both have accepted that the story about the rich man is a parable. Where do you believe Abraham was between dying and getting to heaven? But, just let us assume that he was not in heaven before Christ's resurrection, but some place else between dying and actually getting to heaven - such as limbo? How does this then deny the reality of hell?\n \n Anyway, to the passage at hand...\n Look a little earlier to understand its context.\n John 3\n 3 \n In reply Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again\"\n \n It is in keeping with\n John 8\n 52\n At this the Jews exclaimed, \"Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death.\n 53\n Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?\" \n \n Repeated in Matthew 7:21\n \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. \n \n In other words, no man can get to heaven except by the Son. Just as Jesus said to the thief on the Cross, that his faith would allow him to enter heaven that very day, through his faith in Christ. It is possible that Abraham was literally in a limbo, until Christ's resurrection freed him to enter heaven, then this would be in keeping with the passage from John you cited, however, it in no way denies hell. So what is your point?\n \n What then do you make of...\n Matthew 8:11\n I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. \n \n Matthew 22:32\n 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'[ 22:32 Exodus 3:6] ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\" \n \n Jesus says\n Luke 13:28\n \"There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out. \n \n He's saying that when you die, you'll see Abraham in heaven, but you'll be annoyed because you won't be able to join him. So much for your idea of oblivion.\n \n Also, take note of\n Luke 20:37\n But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'[ 20:37 Exodus 3:6]\n The dead are able to rise... \n In other words, oblivion doesn't come into it... unless you believe you cease to exist, then are re-created.\n \n \nAlso this ?Lazarus? is an illustration. Not the one Jesus knew. This entire thing is a parable. No different than the prodigal son. It is not meant to teach hell fire.\n\n \n Yes, I recognise that it is a different Lazarus...I don't doubt that it is an illustration, hence it need not be literal that Abraham was in heaven (though he was eventually). If it doesn't teach hell fire, then what does it mean? I've asked you on my previous post to put to us an alternate explanation, which is yet to be forthcoming. Why would Jesus so explicitly refer to pain, anguish, and the recognition of the rich-man that he is in hell?\n \n Why is hell repeated so oft as a real place?\n \n \nWhat is your opinion on sheol is that the same hell?\n\n \n a) they are mentioned in different occasions in different places; sheol and hell, thus are different words\n b) it still doesn't help your case, because quite clearly Jesus was teaching that hell is an actual place of punishment - in the parable of Lazarus. Even if you replace hell, with grave, then it still has the rich man suffering, and for you the problem remains, because according to you, he shouldn't exist; but be in oblivion - so how does he suffer?",

   "hell - O.E. hel, helle \"nether world, abode of the dead, infernal regions,\" from P.Gmc. *khaljo (cf. O.Fris. helle, O.N. hel, Ger. H\u00f6lle, Goth. halja \"hell\") \"the underworld,\" lit. \"concealed place,\" from PIE *kel- \"to cover, conceal, save.\" The Eng. word may be in part from O.N. Hel (from P.Gmc. *khalija \"one who covers up or hides something\"), in Norse mythology Loki's daughter, who rules over the evil dead in Niflheim,  the lowest of all worlds (nifl \"mist\"), a death aspect of the three-fold goddess. Transfer of a pagan concept and word to a Christian idiom, used in the K.J.V. for O.T. Heb. Sheol, N.T. Gk. Hades, Gehenna. Used figuratively for \"any bad experience\" since at least 1374. As an expression of disgust, etc., first recorded 1678. Hell-bent is from 1835. Hell-raiser is from 1914 (to raise hell is from 1896); hellacious is 1930s college slang. Expression Hell in a handbasket is c.1941, perhaps a revision of earlier heaven in a handbasket (c.1913), with a sense of \"easy passage\" to whichever destination. Expression hell of a _____ is attested from 1776. Hell or high water is apparently a variation of between the devil and the deep blue sea. To wish someone would go to hell is in Shakespeare (1596). Snowball's chance in hell \"no chance\" is from 1931; till hell freezes over \"never\" is from 1919. To ride hell for leather is from 1889, originally with reference to riding on horseback. Hell on wheels is from 1843. \n \n http://www.etymonline.com/h3etym.htm\n \n Thus even as the Norse used it, it refers to a place where dead people dwell - not just 'oblvious' to their surroundings.\n \n Hel rules Helheim...\n \"Helheim (\"house of Hel\") is one of the nine worlds of Norse mythology. It is ruled by Hel, the monstrous daughter of the trickster god Loki and his wife Angrboda. \n This cold, dark and misty abode of the dead is located in the world of Niflheim, on the lowest level of the Norse universe. No one can ever leave this place, because of the impassable river Gjoll that flows from the spring Hvergelmir and encircles Helheim. Once they enter Helheim, not even the gods can leave. Those who die of old age or disease, and those not killed in battle, go to Helheim while those who die bravely on the battlefield go to Valhalla. \n The entrance to Helheim is guarded by Garm, a monstrous hound, and Modgud. The giant Hraesvelg (\"corpse eater\") sits at the edge of the world, overlooking Helheim. In the form of an eagle with flapping wings he makes the wind blow. \"\n http://www.pantheon.org/articles/h/helheim.html\n \n Balder was the son of Odin and Frigg, and was renowned for his friendliness, gentleness and wisdom. Balder was haunted by nightmares and was afraid of dying, but his mother - the most powerful of all the \u00c5sgard goddesses - extracted an oath from everyone and everything that no one would ever do him harm. The gods soon made a game of flinging weapons at Balder, since he could no longer be killed or wounded. However, Frigg forgot to ask the mistletoe, which she considered too small and insignificant. Loki the Troublemaker learned of this, and deceived the blind Hod into killing Balder with an arrow made of mistletoe. The \u00c6sir sent a rider to Helheim, the Realm of the Dead, to ask for Balder's return. Hel, Queen of Helheim, replied that Balder would be restored to life if the entire world shed tears over his fate. And everything and everyone - even the stones and trees - are still trying (in vain) to weep the dead god back to life. \n http://odin.dep.no/odin/engelsk/norway/history/032005-990465/index-dok000-b-n-a.html\n \n The place helheim, was a place where dead people went, but it was not oblivion. Therefore any pretence JWs would have that hell is derived simply for 'covering-up' falls apart, because the true entymology of the word is clear. ;)",

The trinity has a nasty habit of bending the rules of logic.\n \n If God was murdered he is mortal. God is not mortal. So God could not die for our sins.\n \n If God is immortal and \"released\" him self he committed suicide. Suicide is a sin. Jesus did not sin. So God could not commit suicide. Which means Jesus could not die for our sins with out sinning if he was God. If Jesus sinned then he is no better than Adam whom sinned and the ransom would still be void.\n \n If God died then someone else raised him. If they raised him they restored his almighty power that means they are mightier. If you say the father and the spirit was alive and raised God yet they are God, then God did not die, and the ransom was a hoax.\n \n If the Holy Spirit and the Father did not die they are superior to the Son that died.\n \n ...\n \n Another thing JWs while they don't believe in the trinity they connect the holy spirit so close to God The father that it lacks a tangible personality separate from God's will. So the trinity may actually separate the Holy Spirit from God a little more than the JWs do, for they believe it is his \"active force\" or Gods power projected forth.\n \n As for the 12 apostles they were Jews. \n \n I have implied a few times that CTR was not a Jehovah's Witness in name nor belief.

You said that hell doesn't exist, because the use of the word 'hell' in the Bible stems from an English word.\n \n All it is is using the Norse word 'hel' meaning a place for the dead instead of the Greek 'hades' meaning a place for the dead; where the dead are conscious... as shown in both mythologies.\n \n How does that prove your point? In both cases the place for the dead is a place where the dead are still conscious.\n \n I gave you a pagan Greek example; Orpheus, and a Norse one, as well as a Biblical one; Lazarus. All three have people who are dead who are aware of their dire predicament. Not in oblivion!\n \n Thus your entomology example is rubbish, because regardless which origin of the word we use, it's still a place that's contrary to the oblivion you propose; it is in fact saying that your interpretation of the word is spurious! You've created a meaning that doesn't exist, either in Ancient Greek, Old English/Norse, or modern English use of the word.\n \n Nor does it matter that the Jews didn't have a Hades, because the New Testament was written in Greek. Thus when the Greek-leared Christians were searching around for a word to describe the underworld they could have used the Greek word for 'pit', but no, because they understood that hell was an actual place of conscious beings, so they used the word Hades. Those compiling the Bible were well aware of Greek, having been dominated by the Greeks (then the Romans) for aprox. 300 years. Thus when they were compiling the Bible they chose the word that best represented the meaning of the netherworld; Hades!\n \n In the exact same fashion, when we come to people translating it into English, instead of using the English word for 'pit' (which is 'pit'), they looked around for a word that conferred a meaning of the underworld where beings are conscious; and in the English language that is 'hell'.\n \n I am utterly astounded that you would think that this justifies your reinterpretation of the word!\n \n And as to converting pagans, what do you think the Genitles were, if not pagan - most were. So, when using the word \"Hades\" originally, or 'hell' in the English translation, they are using the right word, because the meaning is clear to their audiences, because their audiences know that these places for the nether world are places where the dead reside - not as in oblivion, so your point is lost again.\n \n Your theory would only work if you found the original New Testament translations using the Greek word for 'pit' instead of 'Hades', and even here your argument falls down because you've already admitted that Pastor Russell didn't rely (in this instance) on the Ancient Greek!\n \n As I said, I'm absolutely astounded you believe you've been vindicated.\n \n \nEcclesiastes 9\n 5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.\n\n \n This last passage is in fact an absolute joke; that you would think that it justifies your case.\n \n Read\n Ecclesiastes 9\n 1\n So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands, but no man knows whether love or hate awaits him.\n 2\n All share a common destiny-the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, [1] the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. \n As it is with the good man, \n so with the sinner; \n as it is with those who take oaths, \n so with those who are afraid to take them. \n \n It doesn't support your idea, because if we were take this literally, absolutely everyone, good AND bad share 'the same fate'. I wouldn't take a literal interpretation either, because it doesn't match my understanding either, it's a lose - lose then for both of us, to use this one the way you would! SO then, for you to use this passage, then it contradicts your notions of heaven! You can't have it both ways.\n \n Even if we look at the passage in isolation, all it says is that a dead person will not be rewarded any further; nothing about punishment, and the notion that they are forgotten is true, nothing to do with them vanishing into oblivion, just that we living forget them. The only one line that might support you is that the dead themselves know nothing, so, if you take five words \"the dead know not anything\" out of the entire chapter, you might, just might have a supporting piece of evidence. :p",

   " Actually we don't count 180 A.D. as the early church.\n\n \n Really, then when is 'the early church' if not before the word was written? You must remember to that in 180 AD the Bible wasn't yet around. So that the word \"Trinity\" pre-dates the Bible.\n \n \nAlso the concept of the trinity does not count. It is too vague a label please be specific.\n\n \n How is it 'vague'? It is an excellent use of one word to represent the concept which is that God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three persons of the same will, and the same being.\n \n \nOur main problem is not that the word is not in the bible. The trinity has a nasty habit of bending the rules of logic.\n If God was murdered he is mortal. God is not mortal. So God could not die for our sins.\n\n \n Jesus was both human and divine. The human part of Him really suffered, and really died, to make the sacrifice meaningful.\n \n You claim that Jesus is a lesser god, anyway, so how is it that this lesser god was able to die? What power did the Romans possess to kill a god, made by God? Especially one equal to God\n Colossians 2\n 9\n For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, \n \n So, if Jesus has the fullness of God, but you believe Jesus did die, but God can't, then you've got your own problems!\n \n Further, God refers to Himself as \"I Am\"\n So does Jesus...\n John 8\n 58\n \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"before Abraham was born, I am!\" \n He doesn't say \"I was\", as neither does God the Father!\n Though your version of the Bible says \"John 8:58 in the Jehovah's Witness Bible says, \"...Before Abraham came into existence, I have been.\"\n \n Exodus 3\n 14\n God said to Moses, \"I am who I am . [1] This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.' \" \n This is Jesus speaking to Moses.\n John 1\n 1\n \"In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was a god.\"\n \n Jesus is with God, at the beginning, not a short time later.\n \n \nIf God is immortal and ?released? him self he committed suicide. Suicide is a sin. Jesus did not sin. So God could not commit suicide. Which means Jesus could not die for our sins with out sinning if he was God. If Jesus sinned then he is no better than Adam whom sinned and the ransom would still be void.\n\n \n I have absolutely no idea what this means. What part of the notion of sacrifice do you not understand?\n \n Further, you don't understand suicide.\n \n Remember the old war-films? A grenade is thrown into a trench and one man throws himself on it to save his buddies. He knowingly has given his life to spare others. That is not suicide, that is self-sacrifice.\n John 15\n 12\n My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.\n 13\n Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.\n \n \nIf God died then someone else raised him. If they raised him they restored his almighty power that means they are mightier. If you say the father and the spirit was alive and raised God yet they are God, then God did not die, and the ransom was a hoax.\n If the Holy Spirit and the Father did not die they are superior to the Son that died.\n\n \n The Father, the Spirit, and the Son were alive. Remember Jesus is human and divine together. The God part of Jesus did not die. You believe that Jesus, the god did die!\n \n In fact the very notion of other gods goes against the Bible...\n The book of Isaiah clearly states that there is only one true God (Isa. 43:10, 11; 44:6; 45:5, 21-23).All other so-called gods are therefore idols or creatures who are falsely regarded as gods (compare Jdg. 16:23 and 2 Cor. 4:4).\n \n Further... does that mean that Jesus created Himself, if John 1:3 says that all things were made through Him? Is that possible? Or is God making another mistake by repeating that without Him nothing was made that has been made? Is it possible for God to make a mistake? Is God not emphasizing here that Jesus is the Creator of all things? (Also compare Col. 1:16, 17 where your Bible translation repeatedly inserted the word ?other? after ?all? to change the clear meaning.)\n \n In fact you criticise us for saying that there's a trinity, when the Bible tells you that there's only one God, yet you ignore this very notion to suggest that there are in fact other gods, Jesus, Satan et al. :)\n But God is not triplex (1 + 1 + 1) ? He is triune (1x1x1)\n \n \nAnother thing JWs while they don?t believe in the trinity they connect the holy spirit so close to God The father that it lacks a tangible personality separate from God?s will. So the trinity may actually separate the Holy Spirit from God a little more than the JWs do, for they believe it is his ?active force? or Gods power projected forth.\n\n \n Yes, then we get back to you ignoring Bible verses...\n The Holy Spirit is a person\n John 14:26-\"But the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He [Gr. that one] will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.\"\n \n John 15:26-\"When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, [that is] the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, He will bear witness of Me.\"\n \n John 16:7-8-\"But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper shall not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you. And He, when He comes, will convict the world...\"\n \n John 16:13-15-\"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. He shall glorify Me; for He shall take of Mine, and shall disclose [it] to you. All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said, that He takes of Mine, and will disclose [it] to you.\"\n \n Actually, see below...\n \n \nAs for the 12 apostles they were Jews. \n I have implied a few times that CTR was not a Jehovah?s Witness in name nor belief. He founded the what became the watchtower.\n BTW what exactly is you question?\n\n \n I had several; one was who is Cornelius?\n \n Doesn?t the Bible say very clearly that the second coming will be such that every eye will see Him?\n \n How do you know that the 'anointed one' in Daniel refers to Jesus?\n \n How do you get some figures to mean weeks, but others years?\n \n Were Christians Christian, before the word \"Christian\" was coined?\n \n Why isn?t the name ?Jehovah?, that is JHWH, used at all in the New Testament?\n \n Now I've some more questions specifically about the Holy Spirit (I know there's a lot, so, take your time) :) I've got heaps of time, Australia Day long-weekend Jan 26th!\n \n How does one grieve an unpersonal force like gravity? (Eph.. 4:30; Isa.. 63:10)\n \n How does one lie to a force? (Acts 5:3-4)\n \n How can the only unforgivable sin be against an unpersonal force? (Mark 3: 28, 29; Heb.. 6:4-6).The TrinHow can one sin against a force anyway?\n \n How can a force be ?holy??\n \n How come the Bible says the Holy Spirit has power, if you say He is a power? (Rom. 15:13, 19).\n \n How can an unpersonal force talk, teach (Rom. 8:26, 27), hear, have a will of its own, have its own intentions, let decisions be taken (Acts 15:28); etcetera? (John 14-16; 1 Cor.. 12:11)\n \n Hint...The Holy Spirit is a divine person - part of the Holy Trinity (Acts 5:3, 4; 2 Cor.. 3:17, 18; Matt. 28:19)\n \n \n Here are a 'few' passages of the Bible JWs have to ignore...\n \n \n The Bible teaches a conscious continued existence after death: Stephen prays to Jesus to receive his spirit (Acts 7: 56, 59).\n Paul desires to depart and be with Christ (Phil. 1:23).\n When we leave our earth, we will live with God (2 Cor.. 5:6, 9).\n Abraham, Isaac and Jacob live in Jesus? time (Luke 20:37, 38).\n Moses and Elijah appear to Jesus [after their deaths](Matt. 17).\n The souls of people talk and wear clothes (Rev. 6:9-11).\n Who believes in Jesus will live, even though he dies (John 11:25, 26).\n Death is without sting and has been conquered by Christ (1 Cor.. 15:55-57).\n Death cannot separate the believer from God (Rom. 8:38, 39) \n The enemies of God are consumed by a raging fire (Heb.. 10:26-31)\n \n A 'real' hell\n Jesus calls the eternal punishment (Matt. 25:46). The following passages of Scripture emphasize the hell as a terrible place of punishment for the unbelievers: Daniel 12:2; Matthew 5:22; 8:12; Mark 9:42-49; John 3:36; Hebrews 10:31, 32; Revelation 19, 20; 20:12-15; 21:8.In these passages God very clearly teaches us that as opposed to eternal life (in the glory of God), there is eternal death which will last forever, will be terrible, will burn day and night over all the wicked (those who do not believe in Him and obey Him). This is an eternal punishment - forever dreadful.\n The enemies of God are consumed by a raging fire (Heb.. 10:26-31).\n \n *But, as promised :) more on The Holy Spirit as a person...\n a. He is spoken of as He and Whom by Jesus (John 14:16,17,26, 15:26, 16:7,8,13-15).\n b. Has a name (Matt 28:19).\n c. Is a revealer of future events (Acts 1:16).\n d. Is an inspirer of prophecy (Heb 3:7).\n e. Bears witness to us through Old Testament prophecy (Heb 10:15).\n f. Is God (Acts 5:3,4).\n g. Descended in bodily form as a dove (Matt 3:16).\n h. He is sent by the Father in Jesus' name (John 14:26).\n i. He is sent by Jesus (John 15:26).\n j. Is a sender of persons (Acts 10:19,20).\n k. Appoints overseers (Acts 20:28).\n l. Is a decider of decrees (Acts 15:28).\n m. He convicts the world (John 16:8).\n n. The world does not behold Him or know Him (John 14:17).\n o. Can be grieved (Eph 4:30).\n p. Can be spoken against (Matt 12:32).\n q. Can be put to the test (Acts 5:9).\n r. Can be blasphemed against (Mark 3:29).\n s. Can be lied to (Acts 5:3).\n t. Can forbid one to speak (Acts 16:6).\n u. Gives testimony to persons (Acts 20:23).\n v. Bears witness with a Christian's spirit that he is a child of God (Rom 8:16).\n w. Intercedes in prayer for Christians (Rom 8:26).\n x. Distributes gifts to Christians (1 Cor 12:11).\n y. Speaks in Christians for their defence (Matt 10:20).\n z. He is a counsellor (John 14:16).\n aa. He teaches a Christian all things (John 14:26).\n ab. He brings to a Christian's remembrance all that Jesus said (John 16:13).\n ac. He guides Christians into all the truth (John 16:13).\n ad. He bears witness to Jesus (John 15:26).\n ae. He glorifies Jesus (John 16:14).\n af. He takes of what is Jesus' and discloses it to Christians (John 16:14).\n ag. He hears (John 16:13).\n ah. He is a helper (John 16:7).\n ai. Is one with whom to have fellowship (2 Cor 13:14).\n aj. Is a comforter (Acts 9:31).\n ak. Jesus' disciples know Him (John 14:17).\n al. He abides with Christians (John 14:17).\n am. He will be with Christians forever (John 14:16).\n an. With the bride says, \"Come!\" (Rev 22:17)\n \n So much then for being a mere 'active force'! You have to ignore a lot of the Bible for this one. :)\n \n Similarities between the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Pharisees: Both deny the Trinity and the Deity of Christ\n Both deny the physical resurrection of Christ and salvation by grace alone.\n \n My thanks to the following sites...\n \n http://www.gksa.org.za/evangelisasie/jwe.htm#hg\n http://www.carm.org/jw/jwresponse.htm\n http://www.equip.org/free/DJ535.htm\n \n \n Recall about adding or subtracting from the Bible?\n \n Col. 1:15-17 in the Jehovah's Witness Bible has an addition of four words. Their version reads, \"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; because by means of him all [other] things were created in the heavens and upon the earth, the things visible and the things invisible, no matter whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. All [other] things have been created through him and for him. Also, he is before all [other] things and by means of him all [other] things were made to exist,\" (Their word \"[other]\" is in their Bible with the brackets. They maintain that they know it isn't in the original Greek Scriptures but the word is implied and should be there.)\n Instead of refuting the bad translation, simply ask them if this means that Jesus created everything. They will say yes. Review this and be very clear and get them to admit that it was Jesus who created everything. Then turn to... Isaiah 44:24 \"This is what the LORD says -your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself.\"\n If Jesus created everything, then why does it say that the Lord (Jehovah in the Hebrew) did it by Himself?\n The only answer is that Jehovah is not simply the name of the Father, but that it is the name of God the Trinity. Therefore, since Jesus is God in flesh, it could be said that Jesus created all things and that Jehovah did it alone.\n Ibid",

   "You are under the false pretense that we have to \"ignore\" parts of the bible to have our beliefs. Therefore if you cite a scripture for your case then it weakens ours. I'll put it like this if you remove all of the outside commentaries and just use the scriptures then yeah we believe all that, and it doesn't conflict with any of our doctrine. The conflicts are with your doctrine not the bible.

   "The good and bad absolutely share the same fate.\n Romans 5\n 12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: (KJV)\n Romans 6\n 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n \n Romans 6 would, on the face of it contradict your first statement. Your notion of heaven - is it populated by people who are neither good nor bad? If people share the same fate when they die, then you can't have a notion of heaven. In fact, you've ripped a part the whole reason for a Saviour - what's the point in Jesus coming if we all face oblivion - who was saved? If they share the same fate, then it must be oblivion! You are at a logical impasse here, unless you say that everyone gets to heaven. But you don't believe this, you believe some have gone to heaven - you've even given me the exact number. This contradicts the notion that we all share the same fate.\n \n However, again you fail to read context...\n Romans 5\n 12\n Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned-- \n 13\n for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.\n 14\n Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. \n 15\n But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! \n \n In other words, Adam sinned and brought death to man - because Adam could have lived forever - had he not sinned. Therefore sin = death, and even though this sin/death continued on through, the gift of God's grace, through one Jesus Christ has over-come death.\n \n This is nothing at all to do with oblivion.\n \n As to the other passage... look again into its context...\n Romans 6\n 8\n Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.\n 9\n For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. \n 10\n The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. \n 11\n In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.\n \n That is the wages of sin is death (as you quoted). Sin = death, because you have died as far as God is concerned.\n \n How does this tie into your belief in oblivion?\n \n \nYou really (sic) in your second argument are restating what I said before. Your hell is a gentile fabrication. Your logic is (Myth+Myth)Parabol= Truth. You actually admit I am correct, but say it is irrelevant because the pagans had a better understanding. You are using the same evidence and ignoring the Jews and saying it is okay because the Norse and Greeks knew more about the afterlife than Gods former people the Jews. Ask a Jew do they believe they will go to be tormented in hell for sinning?\n\n \n You're getting weird. I didn't admit you are correct. I stated you are wrong. You keep trying to make out that Hades means pit, but it doesn't. You have invented a meaning for hell, that does not match its use. You are, wrong. The use of the word has no implications of 'nothingness'.\n \n I'm saying that the Jews of the time of Jesus were well versed in Greek culture. So, when it came time to write the Bible verses into Greek, they didn't use the word for 'pit'. Or, they would have used the word 'pit', in the New Testament. When they used the word 'Hades' it was because it was the Greek word that best described the after-life; that is, a place where people are still conscious. I in no way said that the Norse or Greeks knew more about the after-life, their concepts of 'hell' or 'hades' are closer though then yours of 'pit'/oblivion.\n \n And you simply have to ignore this concept of hell, because you don't want to believe in it. You're now claiming that the Bible is in fact wrong, because someone wanted to win Gentile/pagan converts. You used the word 'fabrication'. Where is your proof?\n It is also illogical...\n This is the same Bible that you're arguing from. This is where you're getting really weird, because you rely on a Pastor who is wrong, and you now hold that the Bible you believe in is wrong; you say that it is a Gentile fabrication - when the Gentiles didn't write Scripture. Why do you bother to use the Bible at all?\n \n We Christians are not Jews. We believe that the Messiah has come. They don't. So, just because they don't believe in an eternal hell, doesn't mean diddly squat to Christians. It is plain that Jesus taught His disciples. He used the example of Lazarus to show what is to come - that parable is not pit-like in any part of it. You've yet to offer an alternative explanation. I suppose now you're going to tell me that Jesus was wrong too!\n \n You've got this weird chopping and changing. Sure, the Jews don't believe in an eternal hell, so you don't. But they don't believe Jesus was a god, but you do! Therefore this undermines your whole argument about relying on what the Jews believed! And even here you're wrong. Jews don't believe in an eternal hell, but they do have 'ghenna', which is a place of punishment. It is not oblivion. \n \n So, even if you were to go by what the Jews believe in, it still doesn't match your idea of the after-life.\n \"Traditional thinkers considered how individuals would be rewarded or punished after their deaths. There are a few rare descriptions of life after death. Traditionalists gave the name Gehenna to the place where souls were punished.\"\n http://www.convert.org/differ.htm#DEATH (they have to be aware in order to be punished - because the punishment is not permanent in Judaism; they believe people will, after punishment, be reunited with God).\n \n In summary, Jews, Gentiles, Christians, don't believe everyone goes straight to oblivion. This is an invention of the JWs.\n You use the Bible, which you now admit is heavily tainted and false, base your ideas on a man who couldn't read the original scripts, and who himself made many false claims based on the Bible. And when none believe in it as you do, you say that this vindicates your argument! :)\n \n It is a JW dogma that is not supported by the Bible. It is an addition to the Bible - which you believe is false anyway. :)\n \n Think about it.",

   " You are under the false pretence that we have to \"ignore\" parts of the bible to have our beliefs. Therefore if you cite a scripture for your case then it weakens ours.\n\n \n You do ignore Scripture - you don't believe in hell, and your previous post you said that hell was an invention. Therefore you're saying that in Scripture, there are mistakes. Or, are you now trying to argue that you don't ignore the mistakes, and believe them too? :) You can't have both arguments.\n \n You've attempted to explain how hell is in the Bible - by saying that it is a fabrication. If you believe this, then you believe you have a reason to ignore it, therefore you do ignore parts of the Bible in order to have your own beliefs.\n \n The alternative is that you do accept that it is a fabrication, and that you don't ignore it, which leaves you where? Accepting a known fabrication?\n \n \nI'll put it like this if you remove all of the outside commentaries and just use the scriptures then yeah we believe all that, and it doesn't conflict with any of our doctrine. The conflicts are with your doctrine not the bible. Because you believe your doctrine is in the bible if we disagree with it then we must be disagree with the bible.\n\n \n No, this isn't the point at all. You make a commentary that the Holy Spirit is not a being, but just a force. I cited Scripture, loads of it that contradicts this idea of the Holy Spirit. So, in fact, you've added an idea, that is not Scripturally based!\n \n Your doctrine is based on your understanding of Scripture, but don't even assume that mine is not based on Scripture either. :(\n \n Your notion of Jesus as a god, is not supported by a load of Bible quotes I gave to Richard.\n \n \nAs for your real hell I still don?t understand it. Once they are consumed they are dead. What reinvigorates them so they can burn forever? \n\n \n Did not Moses see God in a bush that burned, but was not consumed?\n \n \nAlso this makes God a liar if he keeps them alive by means of the spirit.\n\n \n What do you think heaven is? They are alive by the spirit. We are both body and spirit. When we physically die, our spirit lives on. Perhaps your view of heaven is that upon death the body and spirit are whisked off there, but then you've a problem, because the person has died - unless you believe God takes you off to heaven BEFORE you die.\n \n \nFor at Genesis those that eat from the knowledge tree die. Living forever in your Hell is not death.\n\n \n Look at what you just said... Adam ate from the tree. Did he instantly die? He didn't physically, but, he did die. That is what sin is. He died in the sight of God. God doesn't recognise sin, for it is not part of Him. You can already glean the notion that there's a death for the body that's different from a death for the spirit.\n \n \nThe Jehovah alone argument barely makes sense. If Jehovah alone created all things, if you want to say Jesus created all things then okay, but I have no idea why they have to say that. It is not even in our doctrine.\n\n \n That's the point. You say...\n Jesus was created\n but\n Jesus created all things.\n \n Therefore you are in fact saying that Jesus created Himself. How?\n \n \nYour posts will have to take a while to address. \n\n \n Please don't rush.\n \n \nAlso few of the arguments are your own. \n\n \n I claim little originality here, I found a great many questions on a few sites.\n \n \nAll your citations about the Holy Spirit are true I don?t understand the impasse. We must not understand each other.\n\n \n Because you claim that the Holy Spirit is nothing but a 'force'. It's arguing 'how do you lie, to a force?'. In fact, JWs have likened the Holy Spirit to other things, like gravity.\n \n \"The Holy Spirit is not a person, but merely a working force like the forces of gravity or electricity\" (Reasoning from the Scriptures, p. 407). quoted at\n http://www.gksa.org.za/evangelisasie/jwe.htm#hg\n \n Can you deceive gravity? Can you lie to electricity?\n \n In fact, if the Holy Spirit is akin to electricity, you should\n a) be able to scientifically detect 'it'\n b) measure it\n \n If you can do this... you could find science to prove God :)\n \n \n(Similarities between the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Pharisees: Both deny the Trinity and the Deity of Christ\n Both deny the physical resurrection of Christ and salvation by grace alone.)\n Yes, that is because they are Jewish and we are similar to Jews.\n\n \n However, the Jews believed in one God.\n The Jews don't believe that Jesus was a god.\n \n Your beliefs set you apart from everyone else.",

Of course their experience was not exactly the same but the giving up all beliefs and asking for guidance was somewhat similar. And our beliefs ended up being very similar.

   "Hank, just as a reminder as to why I'm a wee bit confused as to where you stand... I raised this issue as far back as Post 213\n \n \nWell the Holy Spirit speaks directly. \n\n \n *Post 185 of the current thread...\n \nI have already stated that I don't believe the Bible, .\n\n \n Hank has said he doesn't believe in the Bible*, but he believes in the Holy Spirit.\n On what basis is this belief founded?\n \n Then, responding to the question \"You may say, that was inserted by the Church to help authenticate their beliefs. So I ask you Hank, again, to provide the saying-teachings of Jesus that you believe to be authentic. \"\n \n Then, Post 279\n \n I will say that I take out the parts that are supernatural and the parts that are obviously included to enhance the image or authority of the church. I also of course don?t believe Jesus was perfect in his teachings, just way ahead of his time. A very intelligent man that was in close harmony with God.\n\n \n SO we have here in summary, a person who\n a) believes in the Holy Spirit\n b) that the Holy Spirit talks to him\n c) that he doesn't believe in the Bible - as far as I know, the primary source of information on the Holy Spirit\n d) doesn't believe, or would exclude the supernatural parts of the Bible anyway, even if he did believe in the Bible, which he doesn't.\n \n At the end of the day, Hank, it's rather unfair. You can criticise various Christian denominations here, Baptist, Catholic, Orthodox, because you get from us what we believe in, and you can go research it on various sites, then take the time and work out your arguments. I on the other hand have been asking for an answer as to what you believe; and what the basis for this belief is. And, you've not been forthcoming.\n \n In the interest of debate, it would be nice if you could lay your cards on the table. If you're worried about being ridiculed, I've already said that I will not debate you on this issue (see my previous post).\n \n I'd just like to know where you stand.\n Thanks, (again) in advance :)\n \n \n * Unless you meant that you don't believe the Bible on a particular issue - but you've not said, as you've not replied to my questions. But that still leaves up in the air a non-supernatural Holy Spirit that talks and guides you.\n \n You certainly don't believe anything written by St. Paul.\n \n \n Since you know that I don?t believe Paul was anywhere near as intelligent or as in tune with the will of God and basically just don?t accept his teachings\n\n (also post 279)\n \n So, you've excluded all the supernatural parts of the Bible, all the writings of St. Paul, and anything associated with the Church being in power - which ever verses these are, you've not specified.",

   "The JWs belief is unique removing things like hellfire, the trinity, and removing the death system shared by most religions and thus having an almost atheist view of death as \"oblivion\" or non existence causes odd side effects trying to explain the JW doctrine in a non linear fashion.

The only physical issue is will they leave corpses. If they are \"transfigured\" it is more aesthetically pleasing.

   "Originally Posted by Hank\n I have encountered others. Of course their experience was not exactly the same but the giving up all beliefs and asking for guidance was somewhat similar. And our beliefs ended up being very similar. What really struck me most thought was the amazing amount of self-confidence in their beliefs. It was like they were very willing to share their experience but didn't feel the necessity of trying to convince others they must do the same. It was like a 'this is what I have found to be true in my life and I recommend you try it but it's your choice'.\n \n Many of the people I knew, although not all, were involved in the Quaker church. But usually Quakers are only found in large cities and I now live in a small town so I rarely run across anyone that believes like I do. But I think what you have seen me refer to as 'great men of God' have very similar experences. \n \n \n Hank,\n 1. Are all men capable of coming to the enlightenment that you have?\n \n 2. Are children capable of this? What about teenagers?\n \n 3. Am I correct in saying that you are able to believe in the idea of a supernatural god...an unseen, intelligent entity that created us and the world without being bound by the world? Furthermore, you are fully capable of believing in the miraculous interaction of God communicating with you personally and directly by guiding you with His \"holy spirit?\"\n \n Yet, you cannot move yourself to believe in the fanciful idea of the Incarnation (that God chose to become man)? You cannot believe that God chose to communicate with us by becoming one of us...By sending Jesus to us? You cannot believe in the incredible idea that Jesus was God and man? That Jesus performed the supernatural acts of miracles? \n \n Are these accurate statements of your beliefs?",

   " The JWs belief is unique removing things like hellfire, the trinity, and removing the death system shared by most religions and thus having an almost atheist view of death as \"oblivion\" or non existence causes odd side effects trying to explain the JW doctrine in a non linear fashion. That we have our study books, for they lay it out in a neat and tidy linear fashion. \n One hole is the death.\n Since we believe in the spirit is literal respiration, and the soul the physical body. If you die that is it. Now we believe in resurrection. This comes with paradoxes is since we don't believe in a traditional soul or sprit. These are before the second death but after ?the end?.\n The bad dead Christians: stay dead.\n The bad dead Pagans: stay dead.\n The bad dead Jews: stay dead.\n The good dead (on earth):\n If you are resurrected on earth technically it is your \"clone\" with your memories (like that Arnold movie the 6th day). It has a sinless body and also may not even look exactly like you. This is still not you technically.\n\n \n Where are clones in the Bible?\n \n How are you rewarded by having a clone take your place? This seems to undermine the very uniqueness of yourself.\n \n Does your clone have a soul?\n \n \nThe good dead Christians (in heaven):\n There are no literal \"spirit bodies\" if you die here you get put in to whatever form an angles is probably. This is still not you technically.\n The survivors: Those alive that survive ?the end?.\n The Survivors on earth:\n Your sinful body won't make it through eternity, for you will have a normal human life span. You where repurchased from sin. So you can?t keep your old body. In whole it will have to be replaced regardless if it is instantaneous or slow if you use ?my grandfathers axe? analogy. This is still not you technically.\n The Survivors going to heaven:\n The physically bodies will be lost in ascension just like those who die. The only physical issue is will they leave corpses. If they are ?transfigured? it is more aesthetically pleasing. This is still not you technically.\n Now this conflicts with a ton of stuff, but it is because it is being explained at the physical level and out of context. At the physical level seemingly everybody dies if you want to be picky.\n\n \n I'm dumbstruck.\n \n \nGehenna means Valley of Hinnom. It is a literal place where the Jews sacrificed their children to false gods by burning them alive. It was later turned into a trash heap and mass open grave. How does this equal hell?\n\n \n It is also the name some Jews used to describe a place to which dead people go for punishment. It is a way of conveying meaning metaphorically as the idea of hell developed.\n \n Further research of Judaism's current tenets has lead me to believe that some Jews do believe in oblivion, for the wicked (only!). Some Jews believe that the wicked go to a place that is further removed from God, than is heaven - this place is referred to as Gehenna - which is, as I explained a metaphor, because Jews are in disagreement as to what the after-life holds in a dogmatic sense (that is they are unwilling to state what is - just what might be). Those that do believe in Gehenna, believe that it is only temporary.\n \n From what I can find then, no Jews hold to the idea that all, good and bad, cease to exist. This is a unique JW interpretation. It certainly is not based on the Bible, because 'hell' as understood by the Jews of the time of Jesus, and therefore the first Christians, believe that it is eternal.\n \n Anyway, Jesus knew of Gehenna, both the real place, and the metaphorical place used to describe the after-life dwelling for bad people. When His teachings were set down in writing, the Gospel writers, understanding Greek could have used words such as 'oblivion', or 'pit', but chose \"Gehenna\" or \"Hades\" because it best fit into the picture of what Jesus was teaching.\n \n This also fits in with the idea that Jesus came to complete the revelations of God's nature with the Jews. Lining yourselves up then, with things simply because the Jews believed in them is flawed - as mentioned previously, they didn't believe that Jesus was the Messiah (whether He was a god or not a god). The understanding of God grew through the centuries culminating in the teachings of Christ. You have taken away from His teachings, simply because they disagree with what the Jews taught, up until c.300 BC.\n \n Why you believe He is the Messiah, I don't know, because you certainly disagree with His teachings.\n \n \"Gehenna is the Hebrew g\u00ea-hinnom (Neh., xi, 30), or the longer form g\u00ea-ben-hinnom (Jos., xv, 8), and g\u00ea-ben\u00ea-hinnom (IV Kings, xxiii, 10) \"valley of the sons of Hinnom\". Hinnom seems to be the name of a person not otherwise known. The Valley of Hinnom is south of Jerusalem and is now called Wadi er-rababi. It was notorious as the scene, in earlier days, of the horrible worship of Moloch. For this reason it was defiled by Josias (IV Kings, xxiii, 10), cursed by Jeremias (Jer., vii, 31-33), and held in abomination by the Jews, who, accordingly, used the name of this valley to designate the abode of the damned (Targ. Jon., Gen., iii, 24; Henoch, c. xxvi). And Christ adopted this usage of the term. Besides Hades and Gehenna, we find in the New Testament many other names for the abode of the damned. It is called \"lower hell\" (Vulg. tartarus) (II Peter, ii, 4), \"abyss\" (Luke, viii, 31 and elsewhere), \"place of torments\" (Luke, xvi, 28), \"pool of fire\" (Apoc., xix, 20 and elsewhere), \"furnace of fire\" (Matt., xiii, 42, 50), \"unquenchable fire\" (Matt., iii, 12, and elsewhere), \"everlasting fire\" (Matt., xviii, 8; xxv, 41; Jude, 7), \"exterior darkness\" (Matt., vii, 12; xxii, 13; xxv, 30), \"mist\" or \"storm of darkness\" (II Peter, ii, 17; Jude, 13). The state of the damned is called \"destruction\" (apoleia, Phil., iii, 19, and elsewhere), \"perdition\" (olethros, I Tim., vi, 9), \"eternal destruction\" (olethros aionios, II Thess., i, 9), \"corruption\" (phthora, Gal., vi, 8), \"death\" (Rom., vi, 21), \"second death\" (Apoc., ii, 11 and elsewhere)\"\n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm\n \n Thus, technically you are correct, that it does describe a valley. However, in popular use, at the time of Jesus' ministry it had also taken on the meaning of a place reviled, a place of torment. You simply ignore the way Jesus used the word, and go back more than a 1,000 years earlier, to when it first appears in the Bible, and then ignore the development of the concept because it disagrees with your ideas... and you disagree with Jesus.",

While it undermines the ?uniqueness of self? that?s okay. \n\n \n So the analogy of the clone is both false (whimsical), and true - as you use it again here just after telling me you don't.\n \n I'm still perplexed.\n \n \nJohn 11\n 24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\n 25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:\n 26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

Jesus quite clearly says that we live forever through faith in Him.\n Thus\n 26\n and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\" \n as you just quoted... SHALL NEVER DIE.\n \n Jesus is talking about the death that is unto death, the death unto God; the final separation of a soul from the sight of God, which is the true death... because it is final.\n See \"The Sin Unto Death\" at\n http://64.226.87.51/topics/sindeath.html\n \n Hell then is the final death, because it is final. You are separated from God, and your fate is eternal separation; which is of itself a punishment. You are dead to God. This is the Sin unto Death.\n \n \n\n Ezekiel 18\n 4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.\n\n \n As I've already explained, sin = death. You die in the face of God. God recognises the righteous, but those that sin choose to be apart from God, and God respects this.\n \n \n\n Romans 3\n 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; \n\n \n Romans 3\n 22\n This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, \n 23\n for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, \n \n This still says the same. Faith in Jesus Christ leads to living with Him forever. It also suggests that all people sin, and this too is true, so what ultimately saves us then is the Grace of God.\n \n \n1 Corinthians 15\n 42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in in corruption:\n \n 1 Corinthians 15\n 50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit in corruption. \n\n \n Look again a bit further\n 1 Corinthians 15\n 56\n The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.\n 57\n But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. \n \n Again sin = death.\n \n Life through the Grace of God.\n \n (Why you believe He is the Messiah, I don't know, because you certainly disagree with His teachings.)\n \n \nThe Danile/Revelation prophecy I posted earlier and the gospels. He is also in Isaiah. We agree with his teaching for we are Christians, but just not with your doctrine.\n\n \n But how do you know that He is the one referred to in Daniel, Isaiah etc?\n \n Yet you disagree when He declares Himself God, and when He talks of hell.\n Look at John 20:28:\n Thomas answered and said to Him [Jesus], \"My Lord and my God!\" The literal Greek says, \"The Lord of me and the God of me.\"\n \n The Jesus of the Bible is prayed to (Acts 7:55-60; Psalm 116:4 and Zech. 13:9 with 1 Cor. 1:1-2).\n The Jesus of the Bible is worshiped (Matt. 2:2,11; 14:33; 28:9; John 9:35-38; Heb. 1:6)\n The Jesus of the Bible called God (John 20:28; Heb 1:8).\n \n \nThe god/God issue really is semantics. It is a side effect of translation.\n\n \n It is the dichotomy that you have created by separating Jesus from God, and declaring Him a god.\n \n And you've still not explained how Romans could kill a god; one who had the fullness of God.\n They are equal...\n \"For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,\" (Colossians 1:19)\n \"For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,\" (Colossians 2:9)\n \"Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also\" (John 8:19). \n \n \n Anyway, look at these two verses...\n \"Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel\" (Isa. 7:14). \n \"Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us\" (Matt. 1:23).(not 'a god with us'; because we only believe in one God)\n \n Thus\n \"Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God\" (Isa. 40:3). And so it was that John the Baptist prepared the way for God, Jesus Christ.\n \n Recall, I asked you about the paradox of who created Jesus? You recognise that Jesus created everything - so did He create Himself?\n \"\"Behold, I come quickly? I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last\" (Rev. 22:12, 13).\"\n This is, Jesus was at the beginning.\n \n I would like to know why you are called Jehovah's Witness, when you should be witness to Jesus Christ. The name Jehovah doesn't appear in the New Testament.",

Some of the arguments so far is from people that don't know as much as you, and are badly constructed. For example Stephen \"praying\" to Jesus If you read the account Jesus was actually there, and appeared before him at the right hand of God.\n \n This is another thing I would like to tell you the watchtower is really into archaic translations of lots of words. Most of doctrine comes to Appling them in context. 1870's aside Gay is a good example.\n \n James 2:3\n And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: (KJV)\n \n I take it the bible does not mean respect those that dress like a homosexual and put them in a better place, but that would be fun if it did.\n \n Now as for Jehovah the Jews had lost the phonetic name by the time the bible was compiled; phonetically the name had changed to soverign lord (Adho\u00b7nai). Thus rendered Ky'ri\u00b7os in Greek or LORD. Our name comes from Isaiah 43:10-12. This is a Great scripture to prove the point. I guess some people like your self would prefer LORD's Witnesses.\n \n I notice you have a problem with the definition of God. You don't seem to like to admit that if the people in the bible had you view the Old Testament conflicts it self. I would like to limit the use of \"a god\" debating the trinity when referring to Jesus and/or Satan for the term is inert. Your Jesus is worshiped, sovereign, and eternal thus Almighty God.

   "... \"Col. 1:15-17 in the Jehovah's Witness Bible has an addition of four words. Their version reads, \"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; because by means of him all [other] things were created in the heavens and upon the earth, the things visible and the things invisible, no matter whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. All [other] things have been created through him and for him. Also, he is before all [other] things and by means of him all [other] things were made to exist,\" (Their word \"[other]\" is in their Bible with the brackets. They maintain that they know it isn't in the original Greek Scriptures but the word is implied and should be there.)\n Instead of refuting the bad translation, simply ask them if this means that Jesus created everything. They will say yes. Review this and be very clear and get them to admit that it was Jesus who created everything. Then turn to... Isaiah 44:24 \"This is what the LORD says -your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself.\"\n If Jesus created everything, then why does it say that the Lord (Jehovah in the Hebrew) did it by Himself?\n The only answer is that Jehovah is not simply the name of the Father, but that it is the name of God the Trinity. Therefore, since Jesus is God in flesh, it could be said that Jesus created all things and that Jehovah did it alone.\"\n \n ---\n \n This argument is shaky. Lets strip down the concept to the barebones.\n \n Isaiah 44:24 God made \"all things\", makes the heavens and earth.\n \n Col 1:15-17\n By means of Jesus all things through him are created. These are all things inside the heavens and the earth.\n \n Montalban unless I am missing the point the argument is, \"this makes the bible conflict its self if you don't believe in the trinity\". It clearly talks of 2 different things and is explained in Proverbs 8:22-31.\n \n Proverbs 8\n 22 \n \"The LORD possessed me (1) at the beginning of His way,\n Before His works of old. \n 23 \n \"From everlasting I was (2) established,\n From the beginning, (3) from the earliest times of the earth. \n 24 \n \"When there were no (4) depths I was brought forth,\n When there were no springs abounding with water. \n 25 \n \"(5) Before the mountains were settled,\n Before the hills I was brought forth; \n 26 \n While He had not yet made the earth and the fields,\n Nor the first dust of the world. \n 27 \n \"When He (6) established the heavens, I was there,\n When (7) He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep, \n 28 \n When He made firm the skies above,\n When the springs of the deep became fixed, \n 29 \n When (8) He set for the sea its boundary\n So that the water would not transgress His command,\n When He marked out (9) the foundations of the earth; \n 30 \n Then (10) I was beside Him, as a master workman;\n And I was daily His delight,\n Rejoicing always before Him, \n 31 \n Rejoicing in the world, His earth,\n And having (11) my delight in the sons of men. \n (NASB)\n \n So that does not conflict if you don't believe in the trinity.",

   "XQ,\n \nSo God had to be in heaven.\n\n I'm not saying God wasn't in heaven.\n \n \nExodus 33\n 18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.\n 19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.\n 20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.\n\n But then He did put a face on Himself in Jesus as recorded in the New Testament. The apostles knew it. Why does Thomas say, \"My Lord and my God!\" in John 20:28  without any correction from Jesus?\n \n Your belief is that there is no savior besides Jehovah, is it not? \"I--I am Jehovah, and beside me there is no savior.\" (New World Translation)\n \n But look at Titus 3:6, \"This he poured out richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior.\" (NWT) and Titus 3:4: \"However, when the kindness and the love for man on the part of our Savior, God  was manifested...\" (NWT) Do these lines not refer to Jesus, God and Savior?\n \n \nI know of the trinity, but I don't understand it. I am not unique, for some Saints that believed in the Trinity did not understand it. As a catholic can you explain to me what you really believe the trinity is with out the fanfare and regalia? If God can be in heaven and on earth at the same time and be his father and his son and be alive and dead while being finite and infinite, me debating the trinity is really a moot point. I think I need to debate if my God is actually your God and if my Jesus is your Jesus before the trinity comes into play\n\n I cannot fully understand the Trinity either. This is not to say that I can understand nothing about it. It is a Christian mystery. One that we can continually learn about but never fully grasp. \n \n Here's the Church's explanation from the catechism using the terms substance(essence or nature), person(hypostasis), and relation:\n \n 252 The Church uses (I) the term \"substance\" (rendered also at times by \"essence\" or \"nature\") to designate the divine being in its unity, (II) the term \"person\" or \"hypostasis\" to designate the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in the real distinction among them, and (III) the term \"relation\" to designate the fact that their distinction lies in the relationship of each to the others. \n \n The dogma of the Holy Trinity \n \n 253 The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three persons, the \"consubstantial Trinity\".83 The divine persons do not share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God whole and entire: \"The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which the Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit is, i.e. by nature one God.\"84 In the words of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), \"Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the divine substance, essence or nature.\"85 \n \n 254 The divine persons are really distinct from one another. \"God is one but not solitary.\"86 \"Father\", \"Son\", \"Holy Spirit\" are not simply names designating modalities of the divine being, for they are really distinct from one another: \"He is not the Father who is the Son, nor is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the Father or the Son.\"87 They are distinct from one another in their relations of origin: \"It is the Father who generates, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds.\"88 The divine Unity is Triune. \n \n 255 The divine persons are relative to one another. Because it does not divide the divine unity, the real distinction of the persons from one another resides solely in the relationships which relate them to one another: \"In the relational names of the persons the Father is related to the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both. While they are called three persons in view of their relations, we believe in one nature or substance.\"89 Indeed \"everything (in them) is one where there is no opposition of relationship.\"90 \"Because of that unity the Father is wholly in the Son and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Son is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Son.\"91 \n \n 256 St. Gregory of Nazianzus, also called \"the Theologian\", entrusts this summary of Trinitarian faith to the catechumens of Constantinople: \n \n Above all guard for me this great deposit of faith for which I live and fight, which I want to take with me as a companion, and which makes me bear all evils and despise all pleasures: I mean the profession of faith in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. I entrust it to you today. By it I am soon going to plunge you into water and raise you up from it. I give it to you as the companion and patron of your whole life. I give you but one divinity and power, existing one in three, and containing the three in a distinct way. Divinity without disparity of substance or nature, without superior degree that raises up or inferior degree that casts down. . . the infinite co-naturality of three infinites. Each person considered in himself is entirely God. . . the three considered together. . . I have not even begun to think of unity when the Trinity bathes me in its splendor. I have not even begun to think of the Trinity when unity grasps me. . .92",

   "Hank,\n \nThat may or may not be true. But I will ask again, does the truth depend on the number of people that believe something?\n\n \n Of course it doesn't. But would God simply be talking to a few people on earth. People that are not evangelistic or missionary that wouldn't spread his teachings? Doesn't seem like a good plan to spread His goodness. Seems like he is attempting to keep his teachings to a chosen few. I don't think God is like that. I think God wants a universal church.\n \n \nI have explained that before. Jesus said it would happen that way and I see no reason to doubt it.\n\n I do not remember, can you supply the scripture if you have it handy?\n \n \nUnless Jesus lied.\n\n And did he lie to those before you in traditional Christianity?\n \n \nEven if you knew what men you were talking about, why would you want to get information through hearsay? Why not go directly to the source? \n \n I have no problem going to the source. I do have a problem with deleting the revelation made by the source 2000 years ago. I do have a problem deleting teachings of the source passed to followers of the source from his own time.\n \n \nExcept for Paul, who was not a follower of Jesus while he was alive, you don't know if the writers of the Bible were close to Jesus or not.\n\n You should study the writings of the Church Fathers.\n \n \nI think you know I'm talking about pagan beliefs where the gods intermingled with humans. The Christian idea is somewhat more sophisticated in its description of the event, but it's still about the same as say Hercules or Alexander the Great. Being found with child of the Holy Ghost is only slightly different than pagan stories. It's still god physically intermingling with humans any way you slice it.\n\n Have you ever heard of a pagan myth of a God born as man in a manger with the donkeys and oxen? Has there ever been a pagan god shunned by his own people who lived with the main purpose of dying for others? Have you ever seen such grandeur and majesty as a crucifixion? I have never heard of a Godhood so humble as that of Jesus. I have never heard of one that established a Church, a creed, and a way of life that has endured 2000 years to continue shaping life and culture.\n \n \nThat's baloney. Protestants don't even believe in the teachings of the Catholic Church. \n \n Protestants do not possess the fullness of truth, they abandoned it at the Reformation. But most do hold to the core teachings of Christ.\n \n \nI don't accept the authority of the Catholic Church any more than I accept the authority of a library for preserving any book I might read. You don't have to be trustworthy to pass along some writings.\n\n You don't have to be trustworthy to pass along writings but you do have to be trustworthy for people to trust your writings. (By the way, Jesus spoke with authority, he acted with authority (in the temple) and he did give his authority to the Church though you do not accept those particular teachings of Jesus).\n \n \nI would think you would know that Jesus was saying to pray in private. The exact location doesn't matter.\n\n So you don't interpret this verse literally do you? Nor do I. Jesus was very figurative sometimes. Showing off with prayer is not good. You are right about that. But you are wrong in thinking that public prayer is bad. Jesus prayed in front of others in the Garden. Jesus and the apostles sang a hymn after the last supper before they went out (\"he who sings prays twice\"). The apostles gathered together to break bread in Acts.\n \n Public prayer is not good simply because of the fact that it is public. Public prayer is good because it is communal--and community is important when you are joined to the Body of Christ  that is the church. Anyone reading the New Testament can realize that. Christ did not preach isolation. Christ preached community.\n \n (Solitude, quiet, joined with prayer are great things and I believe in them. But they cannot stand alone. I'm not trying to bash your prayer life. Catholics call the type of prayer you speak of contemplative prayer. There are many mystics in the Church that practiced it). \n \n \nI believe every time I eat it should be a reminder that he sacrificed his life for his beliefs. In that sense I do that in his memory. I don't do rituals. \n \n Why don't you do rituals? Christ did. He ate the passover meal--that was a ritual. He was presented in the temple by his parents--that was ritual. He was baptized by John--ritual.\n \n \nIf you mean any kind of power structure organization then no. If you mean a spiritual concept of those that ask God into their hearts then yes.\n\n I mean a real, physical, visible church on earth that has governed in Christ's stead since he has ascended into heaven. Christ was not simply a spiritual being, he was a physical being. He did not leave simply a spiritual church but a spiritual and physical one.\n \n What do you think Jesus was speaking of when he said in Matthew 16:18  \"And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it.\" ?\n \n What do you think he meant in Matthew 18:15-17  when he said, \"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the evidence fo two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church, and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile or tax collector.\"\n \n You accuse traditional Christianity of being influenced too heavily by men when it was in fact established by God. Your belief system seems closer to a religion of man, a religion of a single man, than of traditional Christianity.",

   "I doubt that, from a non-biblical standpoint supernatural happenings can be discussed till you die of exhaustion or old age or numb fingers and so on, LOL, but anyway I like people's perspective on the Bible, it causes me much research into things I would never normally think of looking at. This was really my whole point of joining youdebate.com to be refreshed by new ideas, and of course maybe to persuade people into a more sincere search of the Bible and for them not to take everything it says at face value. I'm looking forward to the discussion, my crystal ball tells me it may well become very scientific which is great I love pure science, one of the main reasons I became what you would call a 'creationist' was pure science. I'll try to base my replys around the Bible as much as possible, there's still so much It has to say about the virgin birth.\n What were the parameters you were thinking of? \n Should we lay these out in the debate section?\n\n \n Like number of total post, time between post, who goes first, etc.\n \n Yes we should lay these out in the debate section. I think finding an impartial judge will be our biggest challenge.",

   "Have you ever heard of a pagan myth of a God born as man in a manger with the donkeys and oxen? \n\n Yes. In fact, King Amunothph of the Nile was described as having the exact story as the Gospels tell about Jesus- in 1800 BC.\n \n \nHas there ever been a pagan god shunned by his own people who lived with the main purpose of dying for others?\n\n Yes. The Sun God/King, a popular mythic figure of the time of Jesus' supposed existence.\n \n \nHave you ever seen such grandeur and majesty as a crucifixion? I have never heard of a Godhood so humble as that of Jesus. I have never heard of one that established a Church, a creed, and a way of life that has endured 2000 years to continue shaping life and culture. \n\n I wouldn't describe a crucifixion as \"grand\" or \"majestic\". It just seems bloody and gory. Besides which, according to John Jesus was hung, not crucified, so there is debate on that point. Buddhism, Islam, and many other faiths have endured for millenia and continue to shape life and culture.\n \n The Jesus story is a nice one, I'm not saying it isn't. It's certainly not unique though. \n \n \nThen you are not very well read. Of course no religion has exactly that collection of events. But almost every part you talk about has similar events happening in other religions or myths.\n\n \n What you say is true, many faiths are similar.\n However as I said the case of the tomb of Amunothph is pretty striking in it's near exact similarity to the Gospel stories.\n \n \nThis opinion of the miraculous birth of the kings is well explained in a series of sculptures on the wall of the temple of Luxor (see Fig. 28). First, the god Thoth, with the head of an ibis, and with his ink and pen-case in his left hand, as the messenger of the gods, like the Mercury of the Greeks, tells the maiden queen Mautmes that she is to give birth to a son, who is to be king Amunothph III. Secondly, the god Kneph, the spirit, with a ram's head, and the goddess Athor, with the sun and cow's horns upon her head, both take hold of the queen by her hands, and put into her mouth the character for life, which is to be the life of the coming child. Thirdly, the queen, when the child is to be born, is seated on the midwife's stool, as described in Exodus i. 16; two of the attending nurses rub her hands to ease the pains of childbirth, while another of the nurses holds up the baby, over which is written the name of king Amunothph III. He holds his finger to his mouth to mark his infancy; he has not yet learned to speak. Lastly, the several gods or priests attend in adoration upon their knees to present their gifts to this wonderful child, who is seated in the midst of them, and is receiving their homage. In this picture we have the Annunciation, the Conception, the Birth, and the Adoration, as described in the First and Second Chapters of Luke's Gospel; and as we have historical assurance that the chapters in Matthew's Gospel, which contain the Miraculous Birth of Jesus, are an after addition not in the earliest manuscripts, it seems probable that these two poetical chapters in Luke may also be unhistorical, and be borrowed from the Egyptian accounts of the miraculous birth of their kings.\nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/emec/emec03.htm\n \n see the heiroglyphic engraving here\n \n About other Gods with Virgin Births or similar stories to Jesus'-\n \nRoman/Greek: Demeter and Persephone, Rhea and Zeus, Apollo\n \n In Egypt, virgin mother Isis begat Horus \n \n In Phrygia, Attis was born of the virgin Nama.\n \n A nymph bathing in a river in China is touched by a lotus plant, and the divine Fohi is born.\n \n In Siam, a wandering sunbeam caresses a girl in her teens, and the great and wonderful deliverer, Codom, is born. \n \n In the life of Buddha we read that he descended on his mother Maya, \"in likeness as the heavenly queen, and entered her womb,\" and was born from her right side, to save the world.\" \n \n In Greece, the young god Apollo visits a fair maid of Athens, and a Plato is ushered into the world.\n \n From Greece comes the virgin birth of Adonis, who was resurrected after being killed by a wild boar. Adonis was revered by the Phoenicians as a dying-and-rising god, and Athenians held Adonia, a yearly festival representing his death and resurrection, in midsummer. \n \n From the Americas comes a remarkable story of the god-man Quetzalcoatl told by the Aztecs and Mayans. Not only did he have a virgin birth, but he was associated with the planet Venus, the morning star, as was Jesus. In addition, the religion built around him used the cross as a symbolic representation. Like the myths around Jesus, Quetzalcoatl said he would return to claim his earthly kingdom. \n \n Eighteen hundred years before Christ, we find carved on one of the walls of the great temple of Luxor a picture of the annunciation, conception and birth of King Amunothph III, an almost exact copy of the annunciation, conception and birth of the Christian God. \n \n Mithra was a Persian god who was also a virgin birth, but was more than just a tribal god. Mithra was born in a cave and had twelve companions. Mithra's birthday was also on December 25th. Both religions celebrate the resurrection at Easter. Much of what we know about Mithracism today came from the Christians. The prophet Zoroaster was also born of a virgin.\n \n Perseus and Hercules all experienced virgin births after being fathered by yet other gods. Horus, Mithra, Dionysus and Krishna were all born on December 25th., their births were announced by \"stars\", attended by 'wise men', involved humble birth locations, entailed the massacre of innocents and fleeing for safety from enemies, and so on and on.\n \n For a discussion of several aspects of the Christian virgin-birth story, including speculation on origins.\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/virgin_b.htm\n \n Not only the idea of a virgin mother, but all the other miraculous events, such as the stable cradle, the guiding star, the massacre of the children, the flight to Egypt, and the resurrection and bodily ascension toward the clouds, have not only been borrowed, but are even scarcely altered in the New Testament story of Jesus.\n http://www.sonn.com/~perly/glk/files/Main_Files/B2-BibleB.txt\n Comparisons of the story of Jesus Christ to stories of other religious figures\n \n http://www.church-of-chaos.de/literature/general/truthjesus.html\n http://www.sonn.com/~perly/glk/files/Unsorted_Files/A427-JESUS_Myth.txt\n http://www.uc.summit.nj.uua.org/Sermons/BAB/951203.html\n http://www.crosscircle.com/CH_2m.htm\n \n http://members.aol.com/tjzee/iss174.htm\n A discussion of the virgin-birth story from a modern perspective\n \n",

   "Hank,\n \nAnd it doesn't matter what you think God wants. What matters is what God wants.\n\n Amen.\n \n \nLuke 11:\n [9] And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\n [10] For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\n [11] If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?\n [12] Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?\n [13] If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?\n\n \n 13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly [God] give the [God] to them that ask him? Is that how you read this? God and the Holy Spirit interchangeable?\n \n What do you make of John 14:16  \"And I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him for he dwells with you, and will be in you.\" John 14:26 \"But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.\"\n \n \nI believe God gives answers to anyone who appeals to him with an open heart. However as I have said numerous times, the church was trying to establish it's authority. It had a compelling reason to change the writings to make it look like the church should be in charge. It's not God who is lying, it is those that are trying to be in power.\n\n I thought we had been over the authority issue and decided that those in the early Church did not act as people seeking authority by their willingness to give up their life and thus their earthly authority.\n \n \nThere is no way of knowing if it was revealed or just someone writing their beliefs and desires. You need to go to the source to get the truth.\n\n Those writings are the source of God as Father.\n \n \nThen you are not very well read. Of course no religion has exactly that collection of events. But almost every part you talk about has similar events happening in other religions or myths.\n\n I am not well read because I have never heard anything like the Christian story. It does not appear so much as if Jesus was a man trying to be a God-it did not have the ego, the insanity, the delusion, or the braggadocio of that. It seems much more like a God attempting to become a man-humility, mercy, sacrifice, compassion.\n \n \nWell I'm sure the Catholics are right and every one else is wrong. But that's between you and the Protestants. It's still just a matter of degree as to how much someone accepts or not.\n\n The truth is a matter for all of us. Its not a competition on who has the best truth. It is a history of who has been with the truth unwavering from the beginning and who has maintained the truth. I did not say that everyone else was wrong. I said that they don't have the full truth.\n \n \nIt's not that I don't accept the teachings of Jesus, it's that I don't think he taught that.\n\n I'm not sure why you require Jesus at all.\n \n \nYou are talking about praying with a small group of special friends in a private setting, not a memorized or public prayer to strangers and others to impress people with your oratory skills. \n \n Praying in public is praying with a small group of friends-a small group called the Body of Christ that extends over the entire globe. I don't understand what is wrong with a memorized prayer. I am not sure how you have come to believe that public prayer is an exercise to impress people with oratory skills either. \n \n What do you think of Christ's preaching to 5000 people at the Sermon on the Mount? What do you think of Peter's speaking to and converting 3000 at one time? What of Jesus' command to the apostles to go out and make disciples of all nations?\n \n \nI don't know why not.\n\n Because God calls us to brotherhood with others. He does not call us to be totally wrapped in ourselves.\n \n \nWell I'm not opposed to rituals if it makes you feel good, I just don't do them myself.\n\n More of Jesus' teachings that you have thrown by the wayside.\n But it's not about feeling good. It's about connecting with God in an intimate way. \n \n \nGod is spirit, the physical is a hindrance when dealing with God.\n\n I wonder why God gave you a body then?? I wonder why he made the earth and all of the beautiful things in nature? I wonder why he made beauty in man/woman/animals??? The physical is not a hindrance. It is a complement to the spiritual. The physical comes from God. You are recycling versions of very ancient heresies...albigensianism/catharism-the physical is bad, spirit good...sabellianism/modalism-denial of the three persons of God and that the Spirit is simply a mode of God...pelagianism-an exagerration of self\n \n \nLooks pretty obvious to me like verses inserted to make the church appear to be in charge.\n \n Yeah, the Church chose Peter after the fact, Christ didn't choose him. The \n Church chose Peter, the apostle who denied Christ 3 times. They wanted the most visibly powerful of the apostles to establish their contentious claims to leading Jesus' religion. \n \n \nYou're of course free to believe that but the Holy Spirit would set you free.\n\n Yes, he will set us all free. The Spirit of truth will lead [us] into all  truth John 16:13\n \n \nMany people have come to God exactly as I have. I don't care about traditional Christianity or any other religion. I believe I have the insight of the Holy Spirit.\n\n Many people have thought the same thing over the years...now we are left with over 33,000 denominations of Christianity and many offshoots of Christianity.",

Now it could be an attempt of a madman to prove his delusional Godhood but we can see in the writings about Jesus that he was not mad. He was wise and grounded.\n \n I'm not sure if John spoke of Jesus being hanged but Peter and Paul spoke of Jesus being \"hanged on a tree.\" I don't think this contradicts the crucifixion, as it is a hanging from a tree.\n \n Buddhism seems more of a philosophy than a religion. Islam is an imitation of Christianity. Though they both shape culture and life neither of their founders claimed to be God himself. Neither affected the world in the way that Christian creed has.\n \n \nThe Jesus story is a nice one, I'm not saying it isn't. It's certainly not unique though. \n \n \n Let me clarify my position. I do not deny that certain elements of mythologies resemble certain elements of Christianity. But mythology is different from religion. Certain elements could have developed in parallel trains of thought but I do not believe they were vertical trains of thought. \n \n If I told you that the pyramids in the Americas resembled those in Egypt that would be true. If I told you that one originated from the other, or even that one was influenced by the other, that would be false. They are two entirely seperate cultures. So too, Christianity stands as a story unique and alone.",

   "13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly [God] give the [God] to them that ask him? Is that how you read this? God and the Holy Spirit interchangeable?\n\n \n When you talk about yourself having a spirit, do you think of it as something different from yourself? Yes I think of God and the Holy Spirit as the same. They are just used to give different meanings. Like in this case Jesus was saying God would give his help to the individual understand his will.\n \n \nWhat do you make of John 14:16 \"And I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him for he dwells with you, and will be in you.\" John 14:26 \"But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.\"\n\n \n I make of it that God will send his spirit to teach me all the things that Jesus wanted me to know. Therefore I shouldn&#8217;t depend on others or a &#8216;church&#8217; to teach me since as Jesus said, the Holy Spirit will teach me all things.\n \n \nI thought we had been over the authority issue and decided that those in the early Church did not act as people seeking authority by their willingness to give up their life and thus their earthly authority.\n\n \n Yes we have been over this. And I explained before but guess I need to say it again that there was a time between the original disciples of Jesus and the canonization of the New Testament when the church was becoming a political power when I thought the writings had been doctored to enhance the teachings and authority of the church. Now you know how I think about this for the second time and I know how you think about this so can we move on.\n \n \nThose writings are the source of God as Father.\n\n \n Not according to Jesus as you have pointed out with scripture above.\n \n \nI am not well read because I have never heard anything like the Christian story. It does not appear so much as if Jesus was a man trying to be a God&#8212;it did not have the ego, the insanity, the delusion, or the braggadocio of that. It seems much more like a God attempting to become a man&#8212;humility, mercy, sacrifice, compassion.\n\n \n Well the only thing that can make you well read if to read more.\n \n \nThe truth is a matter for all of us. Its not a competition on who has the best truth. It is a history of who has been with the truth unwavering from the beginning and who has maintained the truth. I did not say that everyone else was wrong. I said that they don't have the full truth.\n\n \n You mean you can have the partial truth and still be right? \n \n \nI'm not sure why you require Jesus at all.\n\n \n Well I have explained that before. But apparently if does me no good to explain what I think about anything because you don&#8217;t seem to read it or at least remember it. So one more time I&#8217;ll say, Jesus points the way to God through his words and actions. Which happens to say you should ask God to send his spirit for guidance.\n \n Actually I&#8217;m not sure why YOU require Jesus at all. You have the church to tell you what the truth is, regardless of whether that includes Jesus or not. \n \n \nPraying in public is praying with a small group of friends&#8212;a small group called the Body of Christ that extends over the entire globe. I don&#8217;t understand what is wrong with a memorized prayer. I am not sure how you have come to believe that public prayer is an exercise to impress people with oratory skills either.\n\n \n Apparently you and I have a different definition of public.\n \n Memorizing a prayer? Do you communicate with your friends and loved ones by memorizing what you are going to say to them and then having a conversation by repeating what you have memorized?\n \n If you don&#8217;t think people pray in public to impress people, then you haven&#8217;t been to the same football games I have. \n \n \nWhat do you think of Christ's preaching to 5000 people at the Sermon on the Mount? What do you think of Peter's speaking to and converting 3000 at one time? What of Jesus' command to the apostles to go out and make disciples of all nations?\n\n \n I thought we were talking about praying, not preaching.\n \n \nBecause God calls us to brotherhood with others. He does not call us to be totally wrapped in ourselves.\n\n \n I&#8217;ve already said brotherhood is fine and I like it. But when I want to know Gods will in my life, I don&#8217;t go to church, I go to the Holy Spirit. That&#8217;s not being wrapped up in myself, that&#8217;s doing what Jesus said to do.\n \n \nMore of Jesus&#8217; teachings that you have thrown by the wayside.\n But it's not about feeling good. It's about connecting with God in an intimate way. \n\n \n If you want to do it then fine by me. Rituals don&#8217;t make me fill connected to God intimately or any other way. The make me fill like I&#8217;m being fake.\n \n \nI wonder why God gave you a body then?? I wonder why he made the earth and all of the beautiful things in nature? I wonder why he made beauty in man/woman/animals??? The physical is not a hindrance. It is a complement to the spiritual. The physical comes from God. You are recycling versions of very ancient heresies&#8230;albigensianism/catharism&#8212;the physical is bad, spirit good&#8230;sabellianism/modalism&#8212;denial of the three persons of God and that the Spirit is simply a mode of God&#8230;pelagianism&#8212;an exagerration of self\n\n \n Oh that&#8217;s just silly. I was referring to your reference to Jesus leaving a physical church. I believe he taught to worship God in spirit. That has nothing to do with some organization of popes, priest, bishops, nuns, hired preachers, deacons, and all the other hierarchy in some physical church. That&#8217;s to say that someone that had only heard just the words of Jesus could not have a relationship with God. \n \n \nYeah, the Church chose Peter after the fact, Christ didn't choose him. The \n Church chose Peter, the apostle who denied Christ 3 times. They wanted the most visibly powerful of the apostles to establish their contentious claims to leading Jesus' religion. \n\n \n I agree.\n \n \nYes, he will set us all free. The Spirit of truth will lead [us] into all truth John 16:13\n\n \n I agree.\n \n \nMany people have thought the same thing over the years&#8230;now we are left with over 33,000 denominations of Christianity and many offshoots of Christianity. \n\n \n The reason we have so many denominations of Christianity is because so many people are willing to believe and follow what some man has said about God instead of going to the source. The Catholic Church is just one of those denominations you&#8217;re talking about.",

   "MAXIMUS,\n I looked through thread and i found theses questions from you that I hadn't personally answered, I hope these were the ones you where talking about, if not let me know.\n \nRichard,\n I don't think God authored the scriptures that the Watchtower promotes. Those scriptures have been altered too many times to be authentic. Proof of this is abundant.\n\n Where? Some detail wouldn't go amiss.\n \n One simple question. You believe Jesus was sent by God to save man (although you believe he was simply a man and not God).\n\n Correct. God couldn't send himself. Jesus is always shown to be UNDER authority from God not equal to him.\n \nYou believe that your religion was showed to us on earth by God (a revealed religion--not one that comes to us simply by learning independently or one that is figured out by meditation or consultation with spirits, etc).\n \n You can't learn about the Bible independently, Acts 8:29-31 says that a guide is needed to show you solid Bible interpretation, otherwise you may well begin to take verses out of context, JW's can always show that they haven't ever taken verses out of context in order to retain personal beliefs. Jehovah's Witnesses have the biggest and best Biblical reference library in the world, every verse is taken into account before we come up with open beliefs.\n \n \nWhy did God reveal it incorrectly the first time? Why did he reveal the wrong religion during the time Jesus lived? During the time when Jesus' followers were around did they teach falsehoods that don't gel with your beliefs?\n\n The religion that Jesus established and past on to the Apostles is the same one scriptually as the religion today known as Jehovah's Witnesses - John 8:31.\n \n \nWhy did God wait after sending Jesus a long, long time ago to endow Charles Taze Russell with the true religion in the late 1800s?\n\n A BIG question with a BIG answer. Lets start with prophecy from the Bible Isaiah 2:2 says that only in the final part of the days would the true religion become noticeable once again, indeed the resurrected Christian organization that the Apostles witnessed in the first century was to appear on a global scale Matt. 24:14. Who fulfils this? \n We need to both sincerely 'scriptually' question our religions. I mean also a refining work was to be done in this reborn Christian faith no one was to have perfect scriptural knowledge instantly (Dan.12:9,10), even the fantastic prophet Daniel had things to learn from the scriptures. Agreed. \n There was also the foretold apostasy to deal with (1Tim. 4:1, 2Thess 2:3) which brings into question the entire 'Christian' community as regards true and scriptually sound teaching, we must only look to sound scriptural reason because of this all important prophecy. TEST TEST TEST the interpretation. \n \n \nWell, a few not so simple questions.\n\n Absolutely, you need the whole Bible to answer that last one.",

Therefore I shouldn't depend on others or a 'church' to teach me since as Jesus said, the Holy Spirit will teach me all things.\n\n Jesus also said that he was establishing a Church.\n \n What's your view of John 20:21-23? How was Jesus (as a mere man) able to breathe upon the apostles the Holy Spirit? \n \n \nYes we have been over this. And I explained before but guess I need to say it again that there was a time between the original disciples of Jesus and the canonization of the New Testament when the church was becoming a political power when I thought the writings had been doctored to enhance the teachings and authority of the church. Now you know how I think about this for the second time and I know how you think about this so can we move on.\n\n I apologize. I admit that I have lost some things due to the length of the debate. \n \n I don't think that there is any proof of this \"doctoring\" though. I don't think its feasible to say that the Church had the time to doctor the New Testament until the time of the canonization of the Bible around 380 being that the writings are dated no later than 100 by most estimates.\n \n \nNot according to Jesus as you have pointed out with scripture above.\n\n I don't follow.\n \n \nWell the only thing that can make you well read if to read more.\n\n Amen.\n \n \nYou mean you can have the partial truth and still be right? \n\n They are right about some things and wrong about others. \n \n \nWell I have explained that before.

So one more time I'll say, Jesus points the way to God through his words and actions.

You have the church to tell you what the truth is, regardless of whether that includes Jesus or not. \n \n The Church exists because Jesus instituted it. The Church has no purpose without Jesus.\n \n \nMemorizing a prayer? Do you communicate with your friends and loved ones by memorizing what you are going to say to them and then having a conversation by repeating what you have memorized?\n\n \n Of course not. But I do familiar repetitive things with them--I love you, hello, good bye, what's up, etc. I have never said that all prayer should be memorized prayer. But I do believe memorized prayer is very effective in bringing one closer to God.\n \n \nIf you don't think people pray in public to impress people, then you haven't been to the same football games I have. \n\n What led you to believe they were trying to impress? \n \n \n \nI thought we were talking about praying, not preaching.\n\n We were but my point is that Jesus was not afraid of proclaiming God in public, nor were his disciples. So too there is nothing wrong with praying to God in public with a group of people.\n \n \nI've already said brotherhood is fine and I like it. But when I want to know Gods will in my life, I don't go to church, I go to the Holy Spirit. That's not being wrapped up in myself, that's doing what Jesus said to do.\n\n So you don't disagree with the brotherhood and praise of public worship? You don't disagree with those that find God's will when worshipping with a group of people?\n \n \nIf you want to do it then fine by me. Rituals don't make me fill connected to God intimately or any other way. The make me fill like I'm being fake.\n\n It's not simply about wanting to do it. It's about having to do it.I'm required to do it by the command of Christ.\n \n \nOh that's just silly. I was referring to your reference to Jesus leaving a physical church. I believe he taught to worship God in spirit. That has nothing to do with some organization of popes, priest, bishops, nuns, hired preachers, deacons, and all the other hierarchy in some physical church. That's to say that someone that had only heard just the words of Jesus could not have a relationship with God. \n \n Do you believe nature and physical elements can complement the spiritual? Jesus did teach to worship God in spirit. But he also taught to worship him in the physical. That's why he preached, taught, met with his disciples at the last supper, kneeled in the garden, healed people, died on a cross. He didn't just say go by yourself and pray to the spirit and all will be granted to you. He established a community that worshipped together, prayed together, broke bread together.\n \n \nThe reason we have so many denominations of Christianity is because so many people are willing to believe and follow what some man has said about God instead of going to the source. The Catholic Church is just one of those denominations you're talking about.\n\n The Catholic Church is not and never has been a denomination.

Introduction\n \n The pattern of intellectual incompetence and lack of proper education within the leadership ranks of the Watchtower (and among all its members) was set by its founder Charles Taze Russell, who dropped out of school at fourteen and had no theological education whatever, and yet considered his Studies in the Scriptures of equal import with the Bible. Both Russell and 4th President Frederick Franz (who made it to sophomore status in college) lied about their academic credentials under oath. As one would expect, JWs oppose higher education, believing it to be a waste of time. Since education encourages the outlook of free and critical thinking, it runs counter to the JW policy of absolute conformity. A survey taken in the early 1970s revealed that less than 5% of JWs had completed college, and less than half had even finished high school. \n \n 2. The New World Translation\n \n The \"Translators\" \n \n Nowhere is this lack of academic credentials more evident than in the \"translation\" committee of the New World Translation (NT: 1950; OT: 1961). The committee requested anonymity, for the supposed reason of modesty and humility, but it was revealed by William Cetnar, a former JW who worked at the headquarters in Brooklyn at the time of the undertaking, and by President Frederick W. Franz at the Scotland Trial in 1954, who stated that he and then-President Nathan H. Knorr headed the committee (see I, 12). \n \n None of the five known \"translators\": Franz, Knorr, George D. Gangas, Milton G. Henschel (later the 5th President of the Watchtower), and A.D. Schroeder, earned a college degree, or any credentials in languages. None but Franz attended college at all, let alone seminary. Franz demonstrated on the witness stand in 1954 that he could neither read nor speak Hebrew, after having earlier lied about his alleged abilities in both. Thus, the NWT is a farce, the purpose of which was to tamper with the Word of God in order to justify false and unbiblical doctrines and practices. \n \n A legitimate translation is the work of one or more Hebrew and/or Greek scholars, usually a large group. The New International Version (1978), for example, was produced by over 100 prominent scholars with Ph.Ds and impressive academic credentials. For these reasons, the great Greek scholar Julius Mantey, whom the Watchtower dishonestly cites in support of their John 1:1 rendering, among other things (see the next section), is on record describing the NWT: \n \n . . . grossly misleading . . . ridiculous . . . diabolical and abominable . . . distortion of the Word of God . . . deliberate dishonesty . . . distortion of other people's translations . . . We need to be exceedingly suspicious of what they have given in their New Testament that's contrary to what you find in the regular translations of the New Testament. (taped lecture)\n John 1:1 Rendering \n In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god. (NWT)\n The NWT reads this way because JWs do not believe that Jesus was God the Son, as Nicene, Chalcedonian Christianity in its three major branches has always held. Greek grammar, however, simply will not permit such a rendering. This is why at least 44 legitimate versions of the New Testament clearly proclaim the deity of Christ in this verse: \n The Word was God: KJV, NASB, RSV, NRSV, NIV, NAB, MLB, Amplified, NKJV, Phillips, Beck, Williams, Rotherham, ASV, Douay, Knox, Jerusalem, Darby, Weymouth, 20th Century, Montgomery, Geneva, Wesley, Riverside, NT in Basic English, Young's Literal Translation, Confraternity. \n God was the Word: Lamsa and the following interlinears: Follett's, Berry, Zondervan, Jay Green, Nestle, and Marshall. \n \n What God was, the Word was: NEB, REB \n . . . he was the same as God: Today's English Version (aka Good News Bible) \n Christ . . . is himself God: Living Bible \n The Word was as to His essence absolute deity: Wuest \n The Word . . . shared his nature: Translator's NT \n The Word was divine: Goodspeed \n The Logos was divine: Moffatt \n The nature of the Word was the same as the nature of God: Barclay \n The Word was with God and was truly God: CEV\n \n The Watchtower cites three translations as precedent for their own rendering of John 1:1 (see, The Word -- Who is He? According to John, 1962, 4-5). The first is The Emphatic Diaglott, a corrupt interlinear version of 1864, by Benjamin Wilson, who was self-educated and no scholar, and a Christadelphian: an Arian heretical sect similar to JWs. The Watchtower may have even tampered with the text of the Diaglott, however. A photocopy of the work which I have seen has \"the LOGOS was God\" in the right-hand translation of the supposed Greek \"a god.\" \n A second translation cited is The NT in an Improved Version, by Archbishop William Newcome, published in London in 1808. This NT, however, did not originally read \"a god.\" The edition cited by JWs was not issued until years after Newcome's death; it was printed by a Unitarian Society, which changed John 1:1 to match up with its own non-trinitarian beliefs. \n \n The third translation mentioned by JWs, and the only one which indisputably has \"a god,\" is The New Testament (1937), by Johannes Greber, a former Catholic priest who had -- by his own admission -- become a spiritist; his wife was a medium. In his Introduction, he wrote: \"I have used the text as it was given to me by those spirits,\" and mentions his book, Communication With the Spirit-World (p. 15). The Watchtower even made reference to this: \n \n Very plainly the spirits in which ex-priest Greber believes helped him in his translation. \n (WT, 15 February 1956)\n \n Yet the Watchtower has elsewhere correctly denounced spiritism: \n . . . a work of the flesh . . . It appeals to the desires of the sinful flesh, not to the things of the spirit, and the apostle warns thaat \"those who practice such things will not inherit God's Kingdom\" -- Gal. 5:19-21 \n (Aid to Bible Understanding, 1971, \"Spiritism,\" 1550)\n \n Make Sure of all Things; Hold Fast to What is Fine (1965) even counsels JWs to \"destroy objects related to spiritistic practices\" (p. 470). Despite all this, Greber is cited as an authority in the very same book! (p. 489), as well as elsewhere in the Aid . . . (pp. 1134, 1669), and in at least three Watchtower magazines (9-15-62, p. 554 / 10-15-75, p. 640 / 4-15-76, p. 231). Apparently, \"new light\" was received by 1983, since The Watchtower of April 1st, in the \"Questions from Readers\" section, stated that: \n . . . The Watchtower has deemed it improper to make use of a translation that has such a close rapport with spiritism (Deut. 18:10-12). The scholarship . . . in the New World Translation is sound and for this reason does not depend at all on Greber's translation for authority. Nothing is lost, therefore, by ceasing to use his New Testament.\n When real scholars are cited by the Watchtower in desperately hoped-for support of its \"a god\" distortion, the result is just as dismal. Dana and Mantey's Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament is misquoted in the Kingdom Interlinear Translation (\"KIT,\" 1969, 1158, under \"John 1:1 -- 'a god'\" in Appendix), as if it supports this rendering. But Julius Mantey wrote a letter to the Watchtower, dated 11 July 1974, in which he replied: \n There is no statement in our grammar that was ever meant to imply that \"a god\" was a permissible translation of John 1:1 . . . you have been quoting me out of context.\n In the very same paragraph from which the KIT quotes (pp. 148-149), Dana and Mantey had clearly stated: \n As it stands, the other persons of the Trinity may be implied in Theos . . . \"The word was deity\" . . .\n Well-known Bible commentator and scholar William Barclay was quoted (WT, 15 May 1977, 320) with reference to John 1:1 also, but he wrote in a letter dated 26 August 1977: \n The Watchtower has, by judicious cutting, made me say the opposite of what I meant to say . . . The Watchtower has . . . left the conclusion that Jesus is not God in a way that suits themselves. They missed the whole point.\n In the Expository Times (November 1953), Barclay wrote that \"a god\" was: \n . . . grammatically impossible. It is abundantly clear that a sect which can translate the New Testament like that is intellectually dishonest.\n The JW rationale for their translation of John 1:1 is as follows: the second occurrence of \"God\" in the verse (Theos) lacks a definite article (\"the\" in English), so it is correctly rendered \"a god\" (see, e.g., the Appendices in the NWT and KIT), whereas Theos with an article should be translated \"God.\" This arbitrary distinction is absurd, according to Greek grammar. Without delving into technical linguistic matters, it is sufficient to note that the NWT violates its own stated principle for John 1:1 94% of the time in the NT. Of the more than 1300 appearances of Theos, 282 lack the definite articlee. Yet in only 16 places does the NWT use for those instances, \"god,\" \"gods,\" \"a god,\" or \"godly.\" Even the passage John 1:1-18 clearly shows the arbitrary dogmatism of the NWT. Theos occurs eight times (Jn 1:1,2,6,12,13,18), with an article appearing in verses 1 and 2. But the NWT has \"God\" six times, and \"a god\" and \"the god\" once each. \n Such examples could be multiplied, of course, but let's examine what would happen if the NWT actually followed its own \"pseudo-scholarly\" rule. The following verses lack an article, but the NWT has \"God\" in all of them. If we change \"God\" to \"a god\" (again, following their own reasoning) will the rule make any sense?: \n \n Matthew 6:24: You cannot slave for a god and riches. \n Luke 1:35: . . . what is born will be called holy, a god's Son. \n Romans 1:17: . . . a god's righteousness is being revealed. \n Philippians 2:11: Every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of a god the Father. \n Titus 1:1: Paul, a slave of a god . . . [making Paul an idolater . . . ]\n John 8:58 Rendering \n Before Abraham came into existence, I have been. (NWT)\n This is another literally impossible translation. The 1950 NWT cited this verse as an example of the \"perfect indefinite tense\" in its notes. No such tense exists in the Greek language! In the KIT, one can see the Greek phrase ego eimi in the left hand column with the literal rendering, \"I am.\" But because this is an obvious reference to God's own proclaimed name -- I AM -- of Exodus 3:14 (also ego eimi in the Greek Septuagint Version of the OT, from which the NT writers quoted), and clearly teaches the eternality and deity of Jesus, the Watchtower had to change it. \n It is interesting to note that the Jews then tried to stone Jesus, as recorded in the next verse. The only plausible reason for this would be His claiming to be God, especially in light of the Jewish response on other occasions (e.g., John 5:18, 10:33, 19:7, and Matthew 26:63-66). In the other three appearances of ego eimi (John 8:24, 13:19, 18:5), the NWT has \"I am\" -- yet another case of inconsistency. The Watchtower can find no Bible version which corresponds to the NWT at John 8:58, but at least 30 translations have \"I am\": KJV, RSV, NRSV, NASB, ASV, NIV, NEB, REB, NAB, TEV, MLB, NKJV, CEV, Phillips, Amplified, Jerusalem, Confraternity, Rotherham, Barclay, Weymouth, Wuest, Douay, Darby, Knox, Geneva, Montgomery, Norlie, Jay Green Interlinear, Bible in Basic English, Young's Literal Translation. \n \n The outstanding Greek scholar A.T. Robertson, author of the largest Greek Grammar ever (more than 1200 pages), who is also often cited by the Watchtower (see section 3 below), commented on this verse as follows: \n \n \"I am\" (ego eimi). Undoubtedly here Jesus claims eternal existence with the absolute phrase used of God. \n (Word Pictures in the NT, Nashville, TN: Broadman Press, 1932, vol. 5 of 6, 158-159)\n \n Likewise, Marvin Vincent's Word Studies in the NT (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1946; orig. 1887; vol. 2 of 4, 181) -- also cited as authoritative by the Watchtower -- states: \n Jesus' life was from and to eternity. Hence the formula for absolute, timeless existence, I am (ego eimi)\n Colossians 1:16-17 Rendering \n . . . All (other) things have been created through him and for him. Also, he is before all (other) things. (NWT)\n This passage clearly teaches that Jesus is the eternal Creator, i.e., God. But the Watchtower preferred to distort Scripture rather than subordinate their viewpoints to it. \"Other\" is simply not found in the Greek text, as a look at the JW KIT will quickly reveal. By adding \"other,\" the impression is left that Jesus, too, is a thing (a creation). The NWT again makes a mockery of its own avowed intention of translation: \n Our endeavor all through has been to give as literal a translation as possible . . . word for word, the exact statement of the original . . . sometimes the use of so small a thing as the definite or indefinite article or the omission of such may alter the correct sense of the original passage. \n (Kingdom Interlinear Translation, 1969, Foreword, 10)\"\n \n **From Dave Armstrong's website.",

   "Richard,\n \nCorrect. God couldn't send himself. Jesus is always shown to be UNDER authority from God not equal to him.\n\n Not really. What do you think of Thomas' declaration of Jesus as God?

Yet Titus says that Jesus is our savior.\n \n \nYou can't learn about the Bible independently, Acts 8:29-31 says that a guide is needed to show you solid Bible interpretation, otherwise you may well begin to take verses out of context\n\n Amen. But you must find the appropriate guide.\n \n \nThe religion that Jesus established and past on to the Apostles is the same one scriptually as the religion today known as Jehovah's Witnesses - John 8:31.\n\n So you can trace your church back to the apostles in an unbroken line?\n \n Your church confesses sins as Christ commanded?

   "Jesus also said that he was establishing a Church.\n\n \n Not a physical church.\n \n \nWhat's your view of John 20:21-23? How was Jesus (as a mere man) able to breathe upon the apostles the Holy Spirit? \n\n \n Not sure what you mean. Are you saying you believe the Holy Spirit was in Jesus breath? That sounds pretty kinky to me.\n \n \nI apologize. I admit that I have lost some things due to the length of the debate. \n\n \n No problem\n \n \nI don't think that there is any proof of this \"doctoring\" though.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you would call proof but there certainly is evidence.\n \n \nI don't think its feasible to say that the Church had the time to doctor the New Testament until the time of the canonization of the Bible around 380 being that the writings are dated no later than 100 by most estimates.\n\n \n What are you talking about? For starters how long does it take to doctor a document? But besides that, if you had a book that you knew was written 200 years ago but the copy you had was only 100 years old, how would you know it was the same as the original? There would be 100 years that you didn't know about. \n \n \nI don't follow.\n\n \n You were quoting from the 14th chapter of John where Jesus was talking about sending the Holy Spirit to teach us.\n \n \nThey are right about some things and wrong about others. \n\n \n Then every one else is wrong about some things?\n \n \nThe Church exists because Jesus instituted it. The Church has no purpose without Jesus.\n\n \n I agree. But we disagree on what the church is that Jesus talked about. \n \n \nOf course not. But I do familiar repetitive things with them--I love you, hello, good bye, what's up, etc. I have never said that all prayer should be memorized prayer. But I do believe memorized prayer is very effective in bringing one closer to God.\n\n \n Well every word in every language is memorized and repetitive.\n \n I don't understand the problem. I have repeatedly stated that if it works for you then go for it. I would feel fake using a memorized prayer so I don't do it. I communicate with God as I communicate with others in my life. \n \n \nWhat led you to believe they were trying to impress? \n\n Come on Maximus. Guys are taught for months to try and knock someone's head off. Then at a 3 hours football game, we spend our two minute token appeal to God to protect the players. Right after that the National Anthem is played (shows where our priorities are) and everyone goes back to screaming at the players to kill someone, including the guy that did the prayer. And you wonder what led me to believe they were just trying to impress?\n \nWe were but my point is that Jesus was not afraid of proclaiming God in public, nor were his disciples.\n\n \n I don't think I've said anything against proclaiming God in public.\n \n \n So too there is nothing wrong with praying to God in public with a group of people.\n\n \n [5] And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n [6] But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n [7] But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\n \n \nSo you don't disagree with the brotherhood and praise of public worship? You don't disagree with those that find God's will when worshipping with a group of people?\n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean by worship. I believe you should get your understanding of God from the Holy Spirit, not from other mortals. But if you are talking about just getting together and telling each other how much you love God, then it's not my thing but have a good time.\n \n \nIt's not simply about wanting to do it. It's about having to do it.I'm required to do it by the command of Christ.\n\n \n We disagree.\n \n \n \nDo you believe nature and physical elements can complement the spiritual? Jesus did teach to worship God in spirit. But he also taught to worship him in the physical. That's why he preached, taught, met with his disciples at the last supper, kneeled in the garden, healed people, died on a cross. He didn't just say go by yourself and pray to the spirit and all will be granted to you. He established a community that worshipped together, prayed together, broke bread together.\n\n \n We disagree on most of those conclusions.\n \n \nThe Catholic Church is not and never has been a denomination. It is THE CHURCH established by Christ from which all of the splinters of Christianity have sprung.\n\n \n denomination - a religious organization uniting local congregations in a single legal and administrative body\n \n I'd say that pretty much describes the Catholic Church, and most other Christian organizations.\n \n I can't tell the sound of your voice, but you sounded defensive about that statement.",

But the NWT has \"God\" six times, and \"a god\" and \"the god\" once each. \n\n \n You are succeeding in the same field as Montalban as providing me with accusations that I've never heard before, this is an amazing feat, but the thing is I've heard so many now that there never really worthy of a response because their usage is always to draw attention away from the incorrect assumptions that Trinitarians so clearly make. \n \nSuch examples could be multiplied, of course, but let's examine what would happen if the NWT actually followed its own \"pseudo-scholarly\" rule. The following verses lack an article, but the NWT has \"God\" in all of them. If we change \"God\" to \"a god\" (again, following their own reasoning) will the rule make any sense?: \n Matthew 6:24: You cannot slave for a god and riches. \n Luke 1:35: . . . what is born will be called holy, a god's Son. \n Romans 1:17: . . . a god's righteousness is being revealed. \n Philippians 2:11: Every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of a god the Father. \n Titus 1:1: Paul, a slave of a god . . . [making Paul an idolater . . . ]\n\n If I may mention you need to include the rest of the rule followed by Jehovah's witnesses in their rendition of john 1:1, otherwise you may be found guilty of misrepresentation. \n Quotes: NWT. Appendix 6a. (WBTS)\n Jesus-A Godlike One; Divine\n These translations use such words as \"a god,\" \"divine\" or \"godlike\" because the Greek word qeV (the\u00b7os') is a singular predicate noun occurring before the verb and is not preceded by the definite article. This is an anarthrous the\u00b7os'. The God with whom the Word, or Logos, was originally is designated here by the Greek expression \u00c8 qeV, that is, the\u00b7os' preceded by the definite article ho. This is an articular the\u00b7os'. Careful translators recognize that the articular construction of the noun points to an identity, a personality, whereas a singular anarthrous predicate noun preceding the verb points to a quality about someone. Therefore, John's statement that the Word or Logos was \"a god\" or \"divine\" or \"godlike\" does not mean that he was the God with whom he was. It merely expresses a certain quality about the Word, or Logos, but it does not identify him as one and the same as God himself.\n In the Greek text there are many cases of a singular anarthrous predicate noun preceding the verb, such as in Mr 6:49; 11:32; Joh 4:19; 6:70; 8:44; 9:17; 10:1, 13, 33; 12:6. In these places translators insert the indefinite article \"a\" before the predicate noun in order to bring out the quality or characteristic of the subject. Since the indefinite article is inserted before the predicate noun in such texts, with equal justification the indefinite article \"a\" is inserted before the anarthrous qeV in the predicate of John 1:1 to make it read \"a god.\" The Sacred Scriptures confirm the correctness of this rendering.\n In his article \"Qualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,\" published in Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 92, Philadelphia, 1973, p. 85, Philip B. Harner said that such clauses as the one in Joh 1:1, \"with an anarthrous predicate preceding the verb, are primarily qualitative in meaning. They indicate that the logos has the nature of theos. There is no basis for regarding the predicate theos as definite.\" On p. 87 of his article, Harner concluded: \"In John 1:1 I think that the qualitative force of the predicate is so prominent that the noun cannot be regarded as definite.\"\n Following is a list of instances in the gospels of Mark and John where various translators have rendered singular anarthrous predicate nouns occurring before the verb with an indefinite article to denote the indefinite and qualitative status of the subject nouns:\n Scripture Text\n Lines follow the list below respectively.\n New World Translation\n King James Version\n An American Translation\n New International Version\n Revised Standard Version\n Today's English Version\n Mark\n \u00deMr\u00dc 6:49 an apparition a spirit a ghost a ghost a ghost a ghost\n \u00deMr\u00dc 11:32 a prophet a prophet a prophet a prophet a real prophet a prophet\n John\n \u00deJoh\u00dc 4:19 a prophet a prophet a prophet a prophet a prophet a prophet\n \u00deJoh\u00dc 6:70 a slanderer a devil an informer a devil a devil a devil\n \u00deJoh\u00dc 8:44 a manslayer a murderer a murderer a murderer a murderer a murderer\n \u00deJoh\u00dc 8:44 a liar a liar a liar a liar a liar a liar\n \u00deJoh\u00dc 9:17 a prophet a prophet a prophet a prophet a prophet a prophet\n \u00deJoh\u00dc 10:1 a thief a thief a thief a thief a thief a thief\n \u00deJoh\u00dc 10:13 a hired man an hireling a hired man a hired hand a hireling a hired man\n \u00deJoh\u00dc 10:33 a man a man a mere man a mere man a man a man\n \u00deJoh\u00dc 12:6 a thief a thief a thief a thief a thief a thief\n This is basic Greek understanding, no PhD required. Although some form of unbiased approach is a must. Tell me what you think of this sound reason, this is after all the thing that has to be settled.\n [QUOTE]Before Abraham came into existence, I have been. (NWT)\n This is another literally impossible translation. The 1950 NWT cited this verse as an example of the \"perfect indefinite tense\" in its notes. No such tense exists in the Greek language! In the KIT, one can see the Greek phrase ego eimi in the left hand column with the literal rendering, \"I am.\" But because this is an obvious reference to God's own proclaimed name -- I AM -- of Exodus 3:14 (also ego eimi in the Greek Septuagint Version of the OT, from which the NT writers quoted), and clearly teaches the eternality and deity of Jesus, the Watchtower had to change it. \n It is interesting to note that the Jews then tried to stone Jesus, as recorded in the next verse. The only plausible reason for this would be His claiming to be God, especially in light of the Jewish response on other occasions (e.g., John 5:18, 10:33, 19:7, and Matthew 26:63-66). In the other three appearances of ego eimi (John 8:24, 13:19, 18:5), the NWT has \"I am\" -- yet another case of inconsistency. The Watchtower can find no Bible version which corresponds to the NWT at John 8:58, but at least 30 translations have \"I am\": KJV, RSV, NRSV, NASB, ASV, NIV, NEB, REB, NAB, TEV, MLB, NKJV, CEV, Phillips, Amplified, Jerusalem, Confraternity, Rotherham, Barclay, Weymouth, Wuest, Douay, Darby, Knox, Geneva, Montgomery, Norlie, Jay Green Interlinear, Bible in Basic English, Young's Literal Translation. \n \n The outstanding Greek scholar A.T. Robertson, author of the largest Greek Grammar ever (more than 1200 pages), who is also often cited by the Watchtower (see section 3 below), commented on this verse as follows: \n \n \"I am\" (ego eimi). Undoubtedly here Jesus claims eternal existence with the absolute phrase used of God. \n (Word Pictures in the NT, Nashville, TN: Broadman Press, 1932, vol. 5 of 6, 158-159)\n \n Likewise, Marvin Vincent's Word Studies in the NT (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1946; orig. 1887; vol. 2 of 4, 181) -- also cited as authoritative by the Watchtower -- states: \n Jesus' life was from and to eternity. Hence the formula for absolute, timeless existence, I am (ego eimi)[/QUOTES]\n Quotes Appendix 6F From the questioned NWT (WBTS)\n Jesus-In Existence Before Abraham\n The action expressed in Joh 8:58 started \"before Abraham came into existence\" and is still in progress. In such situation e\u00c1m<< (ei\u00b7mi'), which is the first-person singular present indicative, is properly translated by the perfect indicative. Examples of the same syntax are found in Lu 2:48; 13:7; 15:29; Joh 5:6; 14:9; 15:27; Ac 15:21; 2Co 12:19; 1Jo 3:8.\n Concerning this construction, A Grammar of the Idiom of the New Testament, by G. B. Winer, seventh edition, Andover, 1897, p. 267, says: \"Sometimes the Present includes also a past tense (Mdv. 108), viz. when the verb expresses a state which commenced at an earlier period but still continues,-a state in its duration; as, Jno. xv. 27 \u00c0p' \u00c0rc>>V met' \u00c2mo1/2 \u00c2st\u00a7 [ap' ar\u00b7khes' met' e\u00b7mou' e\u00b7ste'], viii. 58 pr\u00b2n 'Abra\u00b1m gen\u00a7sqai \u00c2g\u00b0 e\u00c1mi [prin A\u00b7bra\u00b7am' ge\u00b7ne'sthai e\u00b7go' ei\u00b7mi].\"\n Likewise, A Grammar of New Testament Greek, by J. H. Moulton, Vol. III, by Nigel Turner, Edinburgh, 1963, p. 62, says: \"The Present which indicates the continuance of an action during the past and up to the moment of speaking is virtually the same as Perfective, the only difference being that the action is conceived as still in progress . . . It is frequent in the N[ew] T[estament]: Lk 248 137 . . . 1529 . . . Jn 56 858 . . . \"\n Attempting to identify Jesus with Jehovah, some say that \u00c2g\u00b0 e\u00c1m<< (e\u00b7go' ei\u00b7mi') is the equivalent of the Hebrew expression 'ani' hu', \"I am he,\" which is used by God. However, it is to be noted that this Hebrew expression is also used by man.-See 1Ch 21:17 ftn.\n Further attempting to identify Jesus with Jehovah, some try to use Ex 3:14 (LXX) which reads: 'Eg| e\u00c1mi \u00c8 \u00cdn (E\u00b7go' ei\u00b7mi ho on), which means \"I am The Being,\" or, \"I am The Existing One.\" This attempt cannot be sustained because the expression in Ex 3:14 is different from the expression in Joh 8:58. (See Ex 3:14 ftn.) Throughout the Christian Greek Scriptures it is not possible to make an identification of Jesus with Jehovah as being the same person..\n More from my library says:\n RS reads: \"Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am [Greek, e\u00b7go' ei\u00b7mi'].'\" (NE, KJ, TEV, JB, NAB all read \"I am,\" some even using capital letters to convey the idea of a title. Thus they endeavor to connect the expression with Exodus 3:14, where, according to their rendering, God refers to himself by the title \"I Am.\") However, in NW the latter part of John 8:58 reads: \"Before Abraham came into existence, I have been.\" (The same idea is conveyed by the wording in AT, Mo, CBW, and SE.)\n Which rendering agrees with the context? The question of the Jews (\u00deJoh 8 \u00dcverse 57) to which Jesus was replying had to do with age, not identity. Jesus' reply logically dealt with his age, the length of his existence. Interestingly, no effort is ever made to apply e\u00b7go' ei\u00b7mi' as a title to the holy spirit.\n Says A Grammar of the Greek New Testament in the Light of Historical Research, by A. T. Robertson: \"The verb [ei\u00b7mi'] . . . Sometimes it does express existence as a predicate like any other verb, as in [e\u00b7go' ei\u00b7mi'] (Jo.\u00deJoh\u00dc 8:58).\"-Nashville, Tenn.; 1934, p. 394.\n You are the one raising some very valid questions Maximus, so what do you think of this explanation from the translation committee regarding why they render John 8:58 the way they do??? \n \nColossians 1:16-17 Rendering \n . . . All (other) things have been created through him and for him. Also, he is before all (other) things. (NWT)\n This passage clearly teaches that Jesus is the eternal Creator, i.e., God. But the Watchtower preferred to distort Scripture rather than subordinate their viewpoints to it. \"Other\" is simply not found in the Greek text, as a look at the JW KIT will quickly reveal. By adding \"other,\" the impression is left that Jesus, too, is a thing (a creation). The NWT again makes a mockery of its own avowed intention of translation: \n Our endeavor all through has been to give as literal a translation as possible . . . word for word, the exact statement of the original . . . sometimes the use of so small a thing as the definite or indefinite article or the omission of such may alter the correct sense of the original passage.\n\n So what they're saying is you have to use additional English words if they don't exist in the original language to get a true English meaning. A rule followed for every translation from one language into another right across the globe. This will only prove to be wrong if it misrepresents what's originally trying to be said. Which this rendering doesn't.\n \n \nNot really. What do you think of Thomas' declaration of Jesus as God? John 20:28 \n\n I think that would be the exact same thing I would say to such an important person if I was brought up in that kind of custom and religious tongue. Notice he didn't call him almighty God, or Jehovah.\n You mustn't jump to the same old conclusions just because two people are referred to in the same way. Humans have been referred to as gods, I'm sure I've already explained this, it's called taking verses out of context!!! \n \nWhat do you think of Titus 3:4, Titus 3:6, and Isaiah 43:11 when cross referenced? I thought that Jehovah was our only savior. Yet Titus says that Jesus is our savior.\n\n Correct Jehovah's arrangement of things is the only way we will get salvation, the fact that he has a tool for that salvation is scriptually accurate. Titus 1:3, 4 speaks of \"God our Savior,\" and then of both \"God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.\" So, both persons are saviors. Jude 25 shows the relationship, saying: \"God, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" Simple if you let it be!!!\n \n Maximus, can you please make your posts to me shorter I understand you have to get your point across but I have to spend a long time making a reply, I'm a married man with three children so I think you'll see my point. Can we just try to stick to a few points at a time I would greatly appreciate it, youdebate.com can only be enjoyable if it doesn't rule my life. Quality comes with substance not quantity.

   "Hank,\n \nNot a physical church.\n\n That's funny, Jesus' closest followers, the apostles, sure did misunderstand him. They all went off and established physical churches in different parts of the world. \n \n (The epistles of Paul were written to churches (\"to the churches of Galatia\")You do remember that Paul's writings are dated the earliest. Churches seem to have been there early. John begins Revelation by addressing the \"seven churches that are in Asia.\")\n \n \nNot sure what you mean. Are you saying you believe the Holy Spirit was in Jesus breath? That sounds pretty kinky to me.\n\n Yes, Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit upon them because Jesus has that power as God. This is a very significant event. Do you remember the last time God breathed on man before this instance in John? It was in Genesis 2:7. He breathed life into man.\n \n \nThen every one else is wrong about some things?\n\n Yes.\n \n \nCome on Maximus. Guys are taught for months to try and knock someone's head off. Then at a 3 hours football game, we spend our two minute token appeal to God to protect the players. Right after that the National Anthem is played (shows where our priorities are) and everyone goes back to screaming at the players to kill someone, including the guy that did the prayer. And you wonder what led me to believe they were just trying to impress?\n\n I am now wondering why were you a spectator at an event that displayed such appalling violence? You indicate that it does not gel with a public prayer before the game. How does it gel with your solitary prayer?\n \n Matthew 18:20  \"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\"\n \n \nI don't think I've said anything against proclaiming God in public.\n\n Then what's wrong with public prayer?\n \n \n[5] And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n [6] But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n [7] But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\n\n What are you attempting to assert? I ask you again do you pray in your closet? There is nothing wrong with praying in public. There is nothing wrong with repitition in prayer. There is something wrong with vain repetition. There is something wrong with hypocrisy.\n \n \ndenomination - a religious organization uniting local congregations in a single legal and administrative body\n I'd say that pretty much describes the Catholic Church, and most other Christian organizations.\n I can't tell the sound of your voice, but you sounded defensive about that statement.\n\n But the Catholic Church was THE Church prior to any denominations.\n \n I often sound defensive when I am defending. Let's see how it sounds this time: The Catholic Church is not and never has been a denomination. It is THE CHURCH established by Christ from which all of the splinters of Christianity have sprung. Yep. Sounds defensive.\n \n I'm not bashing contemplative, quiet, solitary prayer. I'm simply saying that one needs prayer and interaction with a community of believers as well. Jesus formed a community. His community prayed together.\n \n You should look up St. Ignatius of Loyola--the founder of the Jesuits. More specifically you might be interested in the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. He developed silent retreats. I went on one late last year...an all men's retreat. We only spoke to pray (together and out loud), to sing, or to consult the spiritual guidance of a priest. The silence was very rewarding. But so was the communal aspect of men coming together in the name of God and praying together. I understand the benefit of silent prayer, alone with God--as I do this at least one hour per week in adoration of the Real Presence. But I again say that both are necessary according to Jesus' teachings.",

   "Richard,\n Thanks for taking the effort to answer my questions.\n \n \n \"IV. The Scholarly Incompetence and Dishonesty of the Watchtower \n 1. Introduction\n \n The pattern of intellectual incompetence and lack of proper education within the leadership ranks of the Watchtower (and among all its members) was set by its founder Charles Taze Russell, who dropped out of school at fourteen and had no theological education whatever, and yet considered his Studies in the Scriptures of equal import with the Bible. Both Russell and 4th President Frederick Franz (who made it to sophomore status in college) lied about their academic credentials under oath. As one would expect, JWs oppose higher education, believing it to be a waste of time. Since education encourages the outlook of free and critical thinking, it runs counter to the JW policy of absolute conformity. A survey taken in the early 1970s revealed that less than 5% of JWs had completed college, and less than half had even finished high school. \n \n 2. The New World Translation\n \n The \"Translators\" \n \n Nowhere is this lack of academic credentials more evident than in the \"translation\" committee of the New World Translation (NT: 1950; OT: 1961). The committee requested anonymity, for the supposed reason of modesty and humility, but it was revealed by William Cetnar, a former JW who worked at the headquarters in Brooklyn at the time of the undertaking, and by President Frederick W. Franz at the Scotland Trial in 1954, who stated that he and then-President Nathan H. Knorr headed the committee (see I, 12). \n \n None of the five known \"translators\": Franz, Knorr, George D. Gangas, Milton G. Henschel (later the 5th President of the Watchtower), and A.D. Schroeder, earned a college degree, or any credentials in languages. None but Franz attended college at all, let alone seminary. Franz demonstrated on the witness stand in 1954 that he could neither read nor speak Hebrew, after having earlier lied about his alleged abilities in both. Thus, the NWT is a farce, the purpose of which was to tamper with the Word of God in order to justify false and unbiblical doctrines and practices. \n \n A legitimate translation is the work of one or more Hebrew and/or Greek scholars, usually a large group. The New International Version (1978), for example, was produced by over 100 prominent scholars with Ph.Ds and impressive academic credentials. For these reasons, the great Greek scholar Julius Mantey, whom the Watchtower dishonestly cites in support of their John 1:1 rendering, among other things (see the next section), is on record describing the NWT: \n \n . . . grossly misleading . . . ridiculous . . . diabolical and abominable . . . distortion of the Word of God . . . deliberate dishonesty . . . distortion of other people's translations . . . We need to be exceedingly suspicious of what they have given in their New Testament that's contrary to what you find in the regular translations of the New Testament. (taped lecture)\n John 1:1 Rendering \n In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god. (NWT)\n The NWT reads this way because JWs do not believe that Jesus was God the Son, as Nicene, Chalcedonian Christianity in its three major branches has always held. Greek grammar, however, simply will not permit such a rendering. This is why at least 44 legitimate versions of the New Testament clearly proclaim the deity of Christ in this verse: \n The Word was God: KJV, NASB, RSV, NRSV, NIV, NAB, MLB, Amplified, NKJV, Phillips, Beck, Williams, Rotherham, ASV, Douay, Knox, Jerusalem, Darby, Weymouth, 20th Century, Montgomery, Geneva, Wesley, Riverside, NT in Basic English, Young's Literal Translation, Confraternity. \n God was the Word: Lamsa and the following interlinears: Follett's, Berry, Zondervan, Jay Green, Nestle, and Marshall. \n \n What God was, the Word was: NEB, REB \n . . . he was the same as God: Today's English Version (aka Good News Bible) \n Christ . . . is himself God: Living Bible \n The Word was as to His essence absolute deity: Wuest \n The Word . . . shared his nature: Translator's NT \n The Word was divine: Goodspeed \n The Logos was divine: Moffatt \n The nature of the Word was the same as the nature of God: Barclay \n The Word was with God and was truly God: CEV\n \n The Watchtower cites three translations as precedent for their own rendering of John 1:1 (see, The Word -- Who is He? According to John, 1962, 4-5). The first is The Emphatic Diaglott, a corrupt interlinear version of 1864, by Benjamin Wilson, who was self-educated and no scholar, and a Christadelphian: an Arian heretical sect similar to JWs. The Watchtower may have even tampered with the text of the Diaglott, however. A photocopy of the work which I have seen has \"the LOGOS was God\" in the right-hand translation of the supposed Greek \"a god.\" \n A second translation cited is The NT in an Improved Version, by Archbishop William Newcome, published in London in 1808. This NT, however, did not originally read \"a god.\" The edition cited by JWs was not issued until years after Newcome's death; it was printed by a Unitarian Society, which changed John 1:1 to match up with its own non-trinitarian beliefs. \n \n The third translation mentioned by JWs, and the only one which indisputably has \"a god,\" is The New Testament (1937), by Johannes Greber, a former Catholic priest who had -- by his own admission -- become a spiritist; his wife was a medium. In his Introduction, he wrote: \"I have used the text as it was given to me by those spirits,\" and mentions his book, Communication With the Spirit-World (p. 15). The Watchtower even made reference to this: \n \n Very plainly the spirits in which ex-priest Greber believes helped him in his translation. \n (WT, 15 February 1956)\n \n Yet the Watchtower has elsewhere correctly denounced spiritism: \n . . . a work of the flesh . . . It appeals to the desires of the sinful flesh, not to the things of the spirit, and the apostle warns thaat \"those who practice such things will not inherit God's Kingdom\" -- Gal. 5:19-21 \n (Aid to Bible Understanding, 1971, \"Spiritism,\" 1550)\n \n Make Sure of all Things; Hold Fast to What is Fine (1965) even counsels JWs to \"destroy objects related to spiritistic practices\" (p. 470). Despite all this, Greber is cited as an authority in the very same book! (p. 489), as well as elsewhere in the Aid . . . (pp. 1134, 1669), and in at least three Watchtower magazines (9-15-62, p. 554 / 10-15-75, p. 640 / 4-15-76, p. 231). Apparently, \"new light\" was received by 1983, since The Watchtower of April 1st, in the \"Questions from Readers\" section, stated that: \n . . . The Watchtower has deemed it improper to make use of a translation that has such a close rapport with spiritism (Deut. 18:10-12). The scholarship . . . in the New World Translation is sound and for this reason does not depend at all on Greber's translation for authority. Nothing is lost, therefore, by ceasing to use his New Testament.\n When real scholars are cited by the Watchtower in desperately hoped-for support of its \"a god\" distortion, the result is just as dismal. Dana and Mantey's Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament is misquoted in the Kingdom Interlinear Translation (\"KIT,\" 1969, 1158, under \"John 1:1 -- 'a god'\" in Appendix), as if it supports this rendering. But Julius Mantey wrote a letter to the Watchtower, dated 11 July 1974, in which he replied: \n There is no statement in our grammar that was ever meant to imply that \"a god\" was a permissible translation of John 1:1 . . . you have been quoting me out of context.\n In the very same paragraph from which the KIT quotes (pp. 148-149), Dana and Mantey had clearly stated: \n As it stands, the other persons of the Trinity may be implied in Theos . . . \"The word was deity\" . . .\n Well-known Bible commentator and scholar William Barclay was quoted (WT, 15 May 1977, 320) with reference to John 1:1 also, but he wrote in a letter dated 26 August 1977: \n The Watchtower has, by judicious cutting, made me say the opposite of what I meant to say . . . The Watchtower has . . . left the conclusion that Jesus is not God in a way that suits themselves. They missed the whole point.\n In the Expository Times (November 1953), Barclay wrote that \"a god\" was: \n . . . grammatically impossible. It is abundantly clear that a sect which can translate the New Testament like that is intellectually dishonest.\n The JW rationale for their translation of John 1:1 is as follows: the second occurrence of \"God\" in the verse (Theos) lacks a definite article (\"the\" in English), so it is correctly rendered \"a god\" (see, e.g., the Appendices in the NWT and KIT), whereas Theos with an article should be translated \"God.\" This arbitrary distinction is absurd, according to Greek grammar. Without delving into technical linguistic matters, it is sufficient to note that the NWT violates its own stated principle for John 1:1 94% of the time in the NT. Of the more than 1300 appearances of Theos, 282 lack the definite articlee. Yet in only 16 places does the NWT use for those instances, \"god,\" \"gods,\" \"a god,\" or \"godly.\" Even the passage John 1:1-18 clearly shows the arbitrary dogmatism of the NWT. Theos occurs eight times (Jn 1:1,2,6,12,13,18), with an article appearing in verses 1 and 2. But the NWT has \"God\" six times, and \"a god\" and \"the god\" once each. \n Such examples could be multiplied, of course, but let's examine what would happen if the NWT actually followed its own \"pseudo-scholarly\" rule. The following verses lack an article, but the NWT has \"God\" in all of them. If we change \"God\" to \"a god\" (again, following their own reasoning) will the rule make any sense?: \n \n Matthew 6:24: You cannot slave for a god and riches. \n Luke 1:35: . . . what is born will be called holy, a god's Son. \n Romans 1:17: . . . a god's righteousness is being revealed. \n Philippians 2:11: Every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of a god the Father. \n Titus 1:1: Paul, a slave of a god . . . [making Paul an idolater . . . ]\n John 8:58 Rendering \n Before Abraham came into existence, I have been. (NWT)\n This is another literally impossible translation. The 1950 NWT cited this verse as an example of the \"perfect indefinite tense\" in its notes. No such tense exists in the Greek language! In the KIT, one can see the Greek phrase ego eimi in the left hand column with the literal rendering, \"I am.\" But because this is an obvious reference to God's own proclaimed name -- I AM -- of Exodus 3:14 (also ego eimi in the Greek Septuagint Version of the OT, from which the NT writers quoted), and clearly teaches the eternality and deity of Jesus, the Watchtower had to change it. \n It is interesting to note that the Jews then tried to stone Jesus, as recorded in the next verse. The only plausible reason for this would be His claiming to be God, especially in light of the Jewish response on other occasions (e.g., John 5:18, 10:33, 19:7, and Matthew 26:63-66). In the other three appearances of ego eimi (John 8:24, 13:19, 18:5), the NWT has \"I am\" -- yet another case of inconsistency. The Watchtower can find no Bible version which corresponds to the NWT at John 8:58, but at least 30 translations have \"I am\": KJV, RSV, NRSV, NASB, ASV, NIV, NEB, REB, NAB, TEV, MLB, NKJV, CEV, Phillips, Amplified, Jerusalem, Confraternity, Rotherham, Barclay, Weymouth, Wuest, Douay, Darby, Knox, Geneva, Montgomery, Norlie, Jay Green Interlinear, Bible in Basic English, Young's Literal Translation. \n \n The outstanding Greek scholar A.T. Robertson, author of the largest Greek Grammar ever (more than 1200 pages), who is also often cited by the Watchtower (see section 3 below), commented on this verse as follows: \n \n \"I am\" (ego eimi). Undoubtedly here Jesus claims eternal existence with the absolute phrase used of God. \n (Word Pictures in the NT, Nashville, TN: Broadman Press, 1932, vol. 5 of 6, 158-159)\n \n Likewise, Marvin Vincent's Word Studies in the NT (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1946; orig. 1887; vol. 2 of 4, 181) -- also cited as authoritative by the Watchtower -- states: \n Jesus' life was from and to eternity. Hence the formula for absolute, timeless existence, I am (ego eimi)\n Colossians 1:16-17 Rendering \n . . . All (other) things have been created through him and for him. Also, he is before all (other) things. (NWT)\n This passage clearly teaches that Jesus is the eternal Creator, i.e., God. But the Watchtower preferred to distort Scripture rather than subordinate their viewpoints to it. \"Other\" is simply not found in the Greek text, as a look at the JW KIT will quickly reveal. By adding \"other,\" the impression is left that Jesus, too, is a thing (a creation). The NWT again makes a mockery of its own avowed intention of translation: \n Our endeavor all through has been to give as literal a translation as possible . . . word for word, the exact statement of the original . . . sometimes the use of so small a thing as the definite or indefinite article or the omission of such may alter the correct sense of the original passage. \n (Kingdom Interlinear Translation, 1969, Foreword, 10)\"\n \n **From Dave Armstrong's website.\n\n \n \n Hey Maximus welcome to Fallacy 101. You just implied (with someone elses argument) that Jehovah's Witnesses invented Unitarianism thought dishonesty and ignorance. For John 1:1 was translated in the NWT in the late 1950's. Yet a lil Bishop in Egypt around 400 A.D. got his green card pulled for being Unitarian, and gasp dies in exile. Hmm. I wonder what came first?\n \n See unitarianism its not exclusively Jehovah's Witness. So really you are spining your wheels with this one. Maybe if you can prove the Watchtower invented Unitarianism the arguement would stand",

   "The information you provided from the website does not describe a God being born in a manger with animals unless I missed something. Perhaps you can provide more info.\n\n As it says in the quote, Amunothph was born surrounded by the animal-Gods, a bird, ram and cow. See below also about Mithra the Sun God, born in a manger as well.\n \n The idea that Jesus was born in a \"barn\" is based on modern interpretations of the word \"manger\". In the time of which we speak, a manger was as likely to be a cave as it was part of a house.\n \n In that day caves were often used for stables, and tradition is pretty strong in suggesting that it was indeed a cave in which Jesus was born. Justin Martyr (A.D. 160) is the earliest writer to mention this. His statement reads something like, \"Since Joseph could not find a house or inn, he took up residence in a cave.\" Origen (A.D. 250) speaks of the cave as a place where for a long time many have gone to visit; even the enemies of the faith talk about it, he reports. Eusebius, the well_known church historian in the 300's, said the stable was in a cave. Jerome (c. 400), who lived in Bethlehem, said that it was a cave but now with a shrine to the god Tammuz in it.\nmore here\n \n \nAre King Amunothph and Queen Mautmes historical figures or simply imaginative myths?\n\n Inasmuch as god-king figures of ancient times tended to be, probably both.\n \n \nIs the Sun God a myth or a historical person? How was he rejected by the people and was he killed? Tell me more of the Sun God if you have more information.\n\n There are many Sun God stories from that area. The Sun God represented the seasons. Thus, he was born on the longest day of the year, died in the fall, and was resurrected each spring.\n \n \"There was also the story of the Persian sun-god Mithra, a story dating back to about 1400 BC, talks about a hero born of a virgin in a stable on the winter solstice. He was attended by shepherds who brought gifts. He was said to have taken a last supper with his followers before returning to his father, the god of all. Mithra was believed not to have died, but ascended directly to heaven. Followers believed he would return at the end of time to raise the dead in a physical resurrection, for a final judgment. At that time, the world would be destroyed by fire. And yes, followers of Mithra were granted immortal life following baptism.\" more about Mithra here\n \n \nYou missed my point. When I stated that the crucifixion was grand and majestic, I meant it is exactly the thing you wouldn't expect from a man attempting to pull himself up to the ranks of God. It was not majestic or grandiose in an attempt to prove his divinity the way man would attempt to prove it (and he did not fight it, he accepted it). Now it could be an attempt of a madman to prove his delusional Godhood but we can see in the writings about Jesus that he was not mad. He was wise and grounded.\n\n That presumes an acceptance of the gospels as historical fact.\n \n \nI'm not sure if John spoke of Jesus being hanged but Peter and Paul spoke of Jesus being \"hanged on a tree.\" I don't think this contradicts the crucifixion, as it is a hanging from a tree.\n\n Sure it does. If they meant \"crucifiction\" why didn't they say \"crucifiction\"? \n \n \nBuddhism seems more of a philosophy than a religion. Islam is an imitation of Christianity. Though they both shape culture and life neither of their founders claimed to be God himself. Neither affected the world in the way that Christian creed has.\n\n Buddhism is both a religion and a philosophy. Islam originates at around the same time as Christianity, so how can it be a copy? Not to mention how very different the two faiths are in some ways. Certainly neither has effected the Western world as much as Christianity, but in the Eastern world they are much more influent.\n \n \nLet me clarify my position. I do not deny that certain elements of mythologies resemble certain elements of Christianity. But mythology is different from religion. Certain elements could have developed in parallel trains of thought but I do not believe they were vertical trains of thought. \n \n You may believe that all you like, but the facts contract you.",

   "That's funny, Jesus' closest followers, the apostles, sure did misunderstand him. They all went off and established physical churches in different parts of the world. \n\n \n A group of believers is not a physical church in the sense of cathedrals, property and investing in businesses. \n \n \n(The epistles of Paul were written to churches (\"to the churches of Galatia\")You do remember that Paul's writings are dated the earliest. Churches seem to have been there early. John begins Revelation by addressing the \"seven churches that are in Asia.\")\n\n \n I don't know why you keep using this to try and convince me of something. I've already stated that I don't believe Paul was anywhere close to the intellect of Jesus. But you are right about one implication, the Christian church today should be called the Pauline church since it is really the teachings of Paul that the Christian church has followed, not the teachings of Jesus.\n \n \nYes, Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit upon them because Jesus has that power as God. This is a very significant event. Do you remember the last time God breathed on man before this instance in John? It was in Genesis 2:7. He breathed life into man.\n\n \n Now you're saying the Holy Spirit is the life that was in Adam or it is the breath of Jesus. That's even kinkier than before.\n \n \nYes.\n\n \n Well that was my point. You believe that you are right and everyone else is wrong.\n \n \nI am now wondering why were you a spectator at an event that displayed such appalling violence? You indicate that it does not gel with a public prayer before the game. How does it gel with your solitary prayer?\n\n \n What has me attending a sporting event got to do with whether prayer in public was approved by Jesus or not. I was using it to answer your question to me about why I thought some public prayers were not sincere. It's not that the sporting event is wrong, although that is a different subject, it's that it doesn't mix with prayer.\n \n \nMatthew 18:20 \"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\"\n\n \n I thought we were talking about prayer, not gathering.\n \n \nThen what's wrong with public prayer?\n\n \n Jesus said you were a hypocrite for doing it.\n \n \nWhat are you attempting to assert? I ask you again do you pray in your closet? There is nothing wrong with praying in public. There is nothing wrong with repitition in prayer. There is something wrong with vain repetition. There is something wrong with hypocrisy.\n\n \n I'm asserting that Jesus said to pray in private. We both know Jesus was talking about praying in private when he said in a closet. Praying in public is like the hypocrites do as Jesus said. And I don't know how much clearer he could have been on the repetitions issue. If you just repeat something over and over it becomes vain. \n \n \nBut the Catholic Church was THE Church prior to any denominations.\n\n \n Well yeah someone had to be first. But once a split occurred, then the Catholic Church was just one of many.\n \n \nI often sound defensive when I am defending. Let's see how it sounds this time: The Catholic Church is not and never has been a denomination. It is THE CHURCH established by Christ from which all of the splinters of Christianity have sprung. Yep. Sounds defensive.\n\n \n LOL. Well it falls right in with the definition of a denomination.\n \n \n You should look up St. Ignatius of Loyola--the founder of the Jesuits. More specifically you might be interested in the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. He developed silent retreats. I went on one late last year...an all men's retreat. We only spoke to pray (together and out loud), to sing, or to consult the spiritual guidance of a priest. The silence was very rewarding. But so was the communal aspect of men coming together in the name of God and praying together. I understand the benefit of silent prayer, alone with God--as I do this at least one hour per week in adoration of the Real Presence. But I again say that both are necessary according to Jesus' teachings.\n\n \n You continue to point me to a man when I go to the source and use the Holy Spirit.\n \n BTW it appears Richard and I will be debating the virgin birth soon. So I will be concentrating on that and probably not have time to respond to this thread. But thanks for your time and efforts.",

   "Well that proves it. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n About the 40 days/nights in the desert, I was wondering, was Jesus able to be in two places at once? Because although Mark says that right after being baptized -\n \n John says that Jesus made it to a wedding instead.\n \n \n \n Right. A box from 61 AD that says ?James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.? Do you know how common the names Yeshua and Yakov were at the time? That box could have belonged to anyone of many people, including the brother of any of the 19 Jesus' mentioned by Josephus in his Antiquities of the same era. You couldn't spit in 1st c Palestine without hitting a guy calling himslef the Messiah. None of the Jesus' mentioned by Josephus, BTW, correspond to your Messiah, despite attempts to doctor his work.\n \n \n This brings up another strange proposition of the Gospels- if you assume that the trial and death of Jesus happened as the Gospels describe (even ignoring the glaring contradictions), why would the Romans let his body be buried so quickly? The whole point of crucifixion is to torture and humiliate publicly, and part of that requires not letting the person have a \"decent\" burial, but instead having their body rot and/or be eaten by animals. What gives?\n\n \n \n Actually that's what makes the box so cool. It is statistically improbable. There is no record of a Jesus with a brother named James and father named Joseph during that time and that place except \"Jesus\". The odds of more than one are larger than the population of the city at that time I believe. Out of those 19 someone had to be Jesus.\n \n The coolest thing is this box is from around 61 A.D. so it is not like Jesus was famous enough to waste time forging a relic (like the middle ages). The Jews also didn't like him and would not waste time putting his name on their box. Also Jesus really is \"no big deal\" in his contemporary time. He was one of the many guys named Jesus claiming to be the messiah! Christians may get all warm and tingly think of him, but Jesus was no different than any reformation sect. Christianity is a cult based on Judaism. It fits every definition of a cult including the charismatic leader and give up your earthly possessions part. What actually makes every Christian quiver is what if the Jews was right and Jesus was a poser.",

   " The coolest thing is this box is from around 61 A.D. so it is not like Jesus was famous enough to waste time forging a relic (like the middle ages). \n\n \"The bone-box is original; the first inscription, which is in Aramaic, 'Jacob son of Joseph,' is authentic. The second half of the inscription, 'brother of Jesus' is a poorly executed fake and a later addition.\"\n \n ? Rochelle I. Altman Final Report on the James Ossuary\n \n \"The spelling on the Jacob ossuary is 2nd - 7th CE Galilean Aramaic\" Paul Flesher, Director\n Religious Studies Program\n University of Wyoming \n \n Ossuary inscriptions usually ran something like: \"Judah son of Johanan, son of Jethra,\" and do not include a brother's name. In fact, such a reference is almost unknown; the only other known example of reference to a brother has similarities uncannily like the James inscription, even to an untrained eye. Could this inscription have been used as the template? \n \"Shimi, son of Asiya, brother of Hanin\"\n (L. Y. Rahmani, A Catalog of Jewish Ossuaries, no. 570, ).\n \n Rochelle Altman again:\n \"Contrary to all other known ossuaries where little attention is paid to the placement of the inscription, here the placement is clearly carefully calculated, and the first part of the inscription is balanced in proportion to the overall size of the box. This careful balance has been disturbed by the second part of the inscription.\"\n \n \"So it seems clear that the inscription was cut with two hands: the one of the inscription's first half which held the chisel parallel to the stone surface and cut straight down and the other which held it at an angle and used the corner as a point to incise lines of uneven depth or to move along the surface.\"\n ? Paul Flesher Observing the Ossuary\n \n In conclusion-\n \"The ossuary itself is undoubtedly genuine; the well executed\n and formal first part of the inscription is a holographic\n original by a literate (and wealthy) survivor of Jacob Ben\n Josef sometime during the Herodian period. The second part of\n the inscription bears the hallmarks of a fraudulent later\n addition, probably around the 3rd or 4th centuries, and is\n questionable to say the least.\" Rochelle Altman\n \n \nIt is statistically improbable. There is no record of a Jesus with a brother named James and father named Joseph during that time and that place except \"Jesus\".\n\n Actually, there is no contemporary record of a Jesus with a brother named James and a father named Joseph at all- including your Messiah.\n \n There isn't any evidence that \"James the Just\" existed, either.\n \n \nThe odds of more than one are larger than the population of the city at that time I believe. Out of those 19 someone had to be Jesus.\n\n Of the nineteen I mentioned (chronicled by Josephus), none correspond to the Jesus of the Gospels. \n \n For example, there were four high priests who held office between the rule of Herod and the fall of the Temple whose names happened to be Jesus- Jesus ben Phiabi, Jesus ben Sec, Jesus ben Damneus and Jesus ben Gamaliel. Jesus ben Damneus is of note because he happened to have a brother named James, as chronicled by Josephus (Antiquites 20.9).\n \n Josephus writes in 20.9.4-\n \nAnd now Jesus, the son of Gamaliel, became the successor of Jesus, the son of Damneus, in the high priesthood, which the king had taken from the other; on which account a sedition arose between the high priests, with regard to one another; for they got together bodies of the boldest sort of the people, and frequently came, from reproaches, to throwing of stones at each other.\n\n \n Then there were other random Jesus' of note-\n \n Jesus ben Sirach, reputedly the author of the Book of Sirach (aka 'Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach'). part of Old Testament apocrypha. This Jesus, writing in Greek about 180 B.C.E., brought together Jewish 'wisdom' and Homeric-style heroes.\n \n Jesus ben Pandira. A wonder-worker during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (106-79 B.C.), one of the most ruthless of the Maccabean kings. Imprudently, this Jesus launched into a career of end-time prophesy and agitation which upset the king. He met his own premature end-time by being hung on a tree ? and on the eve of a Passover. Scholars have speculated this Jesus founded the Essene sect.\n \n Jesus ben Ananias. Beginning in 62AD, this Jesus had caused disquiet in Jerusalem with a non-stop doom-laden mantra of ?Woe to the city?. He prophesied rather vaguely:\n \n 'A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the holy house, a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice against the whole people.'\n (Josephus, Wars 6:3)\n \n Arrested and flogged by the Romans, he was released as nothing more dangerous than a mad man. He died during the siege of Jerusalem from a rock hurled by a Roman catapult.\n \n Jesus ben Saphat. In the insurrection of 68AD that wrought havoc in Galilee, this Jesus had led the rebels in Tiberias. When the city was about to fall to Vespasian?s legionaries he fled north to Tarichea on the Sea of Galilee. \n \n Jesus ben Gamala. During 68/69 AD this Jesus was a leader of the ?peace party? in the civil war wrecking Judaea. From the walls of Jerusalem he had remonstrated with the besieging Idumeans (led by ?James and John, sons of Susa?). It did him no good. When the Idumeans breached the walls he was put to death and his body thrown to the dogs and carrion birds.\n Jesus ben Thebuth. A priest who, in the final capitulation of the upper city in 69AD, saved his own skin by surrendering the treasures of the Temple, which included two holy candlesticks, goblets of pure gold, sacred curtains and robes of the high priests. The booty figured prominently in the Triumph held for Vespasian and his son Titus.\n \n Jesus ben Stada was a Judean agitator who gave the Romans a headache in the early years of the second century. He met his end in the town of Lydda (twenty five miles from Jerusalem) at the hands of a Roman crucifixion crew. And given the scale that Roman retribution could reach ? at the height of the siege of Jerusalem the Romans were crucifying upwards of five hundred captives a day before the city walls ? dead heroes called Jesus would (quite literally) have been thick on the ground. Not one merits a full-stop in the great universal history.\n \n The fictitious character \"James the Just\" Jesus' brother, was an invention of later Christianity. No such person existed.",

   "The passover was beginning. Pilate alowed JEsus to be removed from the cross for the same reason he allowed him to be crucified, to placate the jews. This particular governate was very difficult for romans to handle. The Jews were devout and stubborn (by roman standards). Pilate had a potential powder keg. If he had allowed Jesus to hang through the passover, he would have had a riot.\n\n Um, wasn't it the Jews who supposedly demanded Jesus' crucifixion? This story is just getting more and more convoluted.\n \n Further, the Gospel descriptions of Pilate don't match at all with testamonies of his contemporaries, Josephus and Philo-\n \n The Gospels describe Pilate as trying to dissuade the Jews from having Jesus killed, Mark 15.14 \"Why, what evil has he done?\" \n \n \"I find no crime in this man ... A third time he said to them, \"Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him.\" Luke 23.4 - 23.22\n \n \"Upon this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, \"If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend; every one who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.\" John 19:12\n \n The actual Jewish people of the time describe him very differently-\n \n Philo describes Pilate as a man of \"inflexible, stubborn, and cruel disposition\" whose administration was characterised by \"greed, violence, robbery, assault, abusive behaviour, frequent executions without trial, and endless savage ferocity.\" Embassy to Gaius, 301-2\n \n Josephus confirms Philo's judgment, recording several episodes of Pilate's brutality and contempt for the Jews. In Judea \"a great number\" were slain protesting an aqueduct. In Samaria, \"a great band of horsemen and foot-men ...fell upon those that were gotten together\", an incident which provoked protests to Vitellius, Roman Legate of Syria, who finally had Pilate removed from office.\n \n This is completely inconsistent with the Pilate of the Gospels, who bothers to have a trial for Jesus, and doesn't even want to execute him, but does so only at the demand of Jewish people.",

   "XQ,\n \nSo you can trace your church back to the apostles in an unbroken line?\n \n (Trace it back fine. The modern Christian congregation 36 C.E. the baptism of Cornelius by Peter. Thus issued in an era we commonly call the gentile times since Cornelius was a Roman centurion. Jesus to Peter to Cornelius see unbroken. The end done.)\n\n Can your church trace its authority back to Peter and the apostles? Paul speaks of the deacons and bishops in his epistles. They were selected by the apostles and authority was transferred by ordination--laying on of hands (1 Timothy 4:14, 1 Timothy 5:22, Acts 15:24). (I also disagree with your claim that you can trace your congregation back to the early Church. You do not believe or teach what the early Church taught). \n \n Where are your bishops and deacons? By whom were they ordained?\n \n \nYour church confesses sins as Christ commanded? \n \nYeah to God.\n\n \n James 5:16  \"confess your sins to one another\"\n Who are the appropriate ones to whom we confess? Those who have the authority to forgive sins in the name of God as handed down by the apostles from Jesus John 20:23.\n \n \nIt celebrates the Eucharist as Christ commanded?\n \n \nYeah Nissan 14th.\n\n But your church does not believe in the Real Presence of the Eucharist and it has no power to consecrate the Eucharist.

What's your take on these verses?\n \n \nIt baptizes as Christ commanded?\n\n \nAll the time.\n\n In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?\n Matthew 28:19 \n \n \nOriginally Posted by XQsThaiPoes\n Hey Maximus welcome to Fallacy 101. You just implied (with someone elses argument) that Jehovah's Witnesses invented Unitarianism thought dishonesty and ignorance. For John 1:1 was translated in the NWT in the late 1950's. Yet a lil Bishop in Egypt around 400 A.D. got his green card pulled for being Unitarian, and gasp dies in exile. Hmm. I wonder what came first?\n See unitarianism its not exclusively Jehovah's Witness. So really you are spining your wheels with this one. Maybe if you can prove the Watchtower invented Unitarianism the arguement would stand\n\n Didn't you recently post to me that you believed the lil bishop in Egypt was correct? Don't the JWs agree with him? Why do you think the Church excommunicated him? \n \n No, the JWs didn't invent unitarianism--it was an ancient heresy called Arianism, as I previously posted. One condemned by the Church due to its errors. JWs didn't invent unitarianism, they simply invented a new form of it building on old heresy.",

   "Mizmaxx,\n \n \nAs it says in the quote, Amunothph was born surrounded by the animal-Gods, a bird, ram and cow. See below also about Mithra the Sun God, born in a manger as well.\n \n Inasmuch as god-king figures of ancient times tended to be, probably both.\n \n There are many Sun God stories from that area. The Sun God represented the seasons. Thus, he was born on the longest day of the year, died in the fall, and was resurrected each spring.\n \n \"There was also the story of the Persian sun-god Mithra, a story dating back to about 1400 BC, talks about a hero born of a virgin in a stable on the winter solstice. He was attended by shepherds who brought gifts. He was said to have taken a last supper with his followers before returning to his father, the god of all. Mithra was believed not to have died, but ascended directly to heaven. Followers believed he would return at the end of time to raise the dead in a physical resurrection, for a final judgment. At that time, the world would be destroyed by fire. And yes, followers of Mithra were granted immortal life following baptism.\" \n \n Animal gods? The sun god represents the seasons?\n \n \"[There is] a disproportion and even disruption between the very ideas of mythology and religion; the chasm between the two categories.It is really the collapse of comparative religion that there is no comparison between God and the gods.  There is no more comparison than there is between a man and the men who walked about in his dreams.\n \n The contrast of monotheism and polytheism is [not simply] a matter of some people having one god and others a few more. \n \n He who has the most sympathy with myths will most fully realise that they are not and never were a religion, in the sense that Christianity or even Islam is a religion. They satisfy some of the needs satisfied by a religion; and notably the need for doing certain things at certain dates; the need of the twin ideas of festivity and formality. But though they provide a man with a calendar they do not provide him with a creed. A man did not stand up and say 'I believe in Jupiter and Juno and Neptune,' etc., as he stands up and says 'I believe in God the Father Almighty' and the rest of the Apostles Creed. Many believed in some and not in others, or more in some and less in others, or only in a very vague poetical sense in any. There was no moment when they were all collected into an orthodox order which men would fight and be tortured to keep intact.\" \n \n I confess I doubt the whole theory of the dissemination of myths or (as it commonly is) of one myth. It is true that something in our nature and conditions make many stories similar; but each of them may be original. One man does not borrow the story from the other man, though he may tell it from the same motive as the other man. It would be easy to apply the whole argument about legend to literature; and turn it into a vulgar monomania of plagiarism. G.K. Chesterton The Everlasting Man\n \n \nThe idea that Jesus was born in a \"barn\" is based on modern interpretations of the word \"manger\". In the time of which we speak, a manger was as likely to be a cave as it was part of a house.\n\n I never restricted the definition of manger to a stable that I can remember.\n \n \nSure it does. If they meant \"crucifiction\" why didn't they say \"crucifiction\"? \n \n Are you telling me that you restrict your vocabulary to one word for each meaning you wish to convey? You don't use synonyms?\n \n \nBuddhism is both a religion and a philosophy. Islam originates at around the same time as Christianity, so how can it be a copy? Not to mention how very different the two faiths are in some ways. Certainly neither has effected the Western world as much as Christianity, but in the Eastern world they are much more influent.\n\n Mohammed was born A.D. 570--a while after Christianity was founded. The Koran cites Christian and Jewish scripture. Islam considered Jesus a prophet. Islam was a by-product of Christianity--an emulation of Christianity's monotheism. It left paganism behind but distorted monotheism.",

   "Hank,\n \nA group of believers is not a physical church in the sense of cathedrals, property and investing in businesses. \n \n Of course not. The first churches were in the homes and catacombs. The Christians were persecuted by the Jews and Romans. It wasn't likely that any church buildings would go up pointing their persecutors to their location. As Christianity was more accepted, cathedrals and churches were a logical progression in worship of God, being that Christianity was founded on the Jewish faith that utilized the Temple as an honor to God (1 Kings 6). \n \n Jesus was not afraid of church. He was presented by his parents in the temple (Luke 2:27). He had an attraction to the temple as a child (Luke 2:46). He frequently taught and healed in the synagogues Matthew 4:23, 9:35, 13:54. Mark 1:21-23, 1:39, 3:1. You don't believe in all of Jesus' teachings, nor do you believe in the place in which he teaches.\n \n But if we do restrict our definition of church to group of believers I have no problem with that because the Church also fits that bill. But I must ask, do you participate in activities with a group of believers?\n \n \nI don't know why you keep using this to try and convince me of something. I've already stated that I don't believe Paul was anywhere close to the intellect of Jesus. But you are right about one implication, the Christian church today should be called the Pauline church since it is really the teachings of Paul that the Christian church has followed, not the teachings of Jesus.\n\n Are we comparing the intellect of Jesus and Paul? Paul was a follower of Jesus. His writings are helpful in understanding early Christianity.\n \n Actually, the tendency toward being too Pauline is a Protestant problem. The Catholic Church has been the anchor that moderates extremism. It is both Petrine and Pauline. It is a Church of balance.\n \n \nWell that was my point. You believe that you are right and everyone else is wrong.\n\n I am not right. The Church is right. The Church is right because it has been granted that power and authority by God (Matthew 16:18). 2,000 years of steadfast teaching is right. All of what I say is under the authority of the Church. There is nothing wrong with saying people are wrong.\n \n \nWhat has me attending a sporting event got to do with whether prayer in public was approved by Jesus or not. I was using it to answer your question to me about why I thought some public prayers were not sincere. It's not that the sporting event is wrong, although that is a different subject, it's that it doesn't mix with prayer.\n\n You seemed to imply that the sporting event was wrong and furthermore that it was wrong to associate prayer with a violent sporting event. Sorry if I misunderstood. I was just wondering why a public prayer doesn't gel with football but you can go to a football game and pray in solitude. \n \n \nI thought we were talking about prayer, not gathering.\n\n What do you think the Jews did when they gathered? Do you think before or after someone taught on scripture about God that they might have prayed? What about scripture being taught in public in the first place? Is that not a form of prayer or worship?\n \n \nJesus said you were a hypocrite for doing it.\n \n I'm asserting that Jesus said to pray in private. We both know Jesus was talking about praying in private when he said in a closet. Praying in public is like the hypocrites do as Jesus said. And I don't know how much clearer he could have been on the repetitions issue. If you just repeat something over and over it becomes vain. \n \n Jesus must have been calling himself a hypocrite. Matt. 26:44  - Jesus prayed a third time in the garden of Gethsemane, saying the exact same words again. It is not the repetition that is the issue. It's the vanity. \n \n He also told us to pray using the words of the Our Father. Can we only say it one time in our life? How many times is repetition?\n \n You are misinterpreting the words of Jesus.\n \n \nWell yeah someone had to be first. But once a split occurred, then the Catholic Church was just one of many.\n\n It was not one of many. It was THE ONE from which many came. There is a difference.\n \n \nYou continue to point me to a man when I go to the source and use the Holy Spirit.\n\n You are truly blessed. I wouldn't throw all of the insight of man away. After all you did say that you believe in the teachings of a \"man\" called Jesus. Some of them anyway. But we must attempt to discern the truth among these teachings of men as you are attempting to do.",

Are you telling me that the Egyptian religion actually became the Christian religion?\n \n I am no linguist but in regards to the \"Holy Bible,\" the word \"holy\" is a middle english word according to the etymology I looked up. I think it would be more related to \"whole\" or \"healthy\" than \"helio.\" Biblia is a latin word coming from Greek. I don't believe sun book is accurate.\n \n \nb) \"Hung from a tree\" and \"crucified\" are not synonyms of each other, they are two completely different ways of killing someone. It's like saying someone was stabbed when they had their throat cut, or vice versa- both involve a knife, but neither are \"synonyms\" of the other. Be honest- this is a contradiction.\n\n I will be honest. If you read the bible then you will see that they are synonyms. What do you think they crucified someone on back in those days? Do you think they had some nicely cut lumber? I bet they used trees.\n \n Luke 23:32  \"Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. And when they came to the place which is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one one the right and one on the left.\"\n \n Luke 23:39  \"One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him saying, \"Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!\" \n \n Do you think Luke equated crucifixion with being hanged? It seems that he does within a few sentences of one another. \n \n Let's go to where Paul quotes Old Testament scripture and says that Jesus was hung on a tree. Galatians 3:13  \"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us-for it is written, 'Cursed be every one who hangs on a tree.'\" But what does Paul say a few paragraphs earlier? Galatians 2:20  \"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me...\" \n \n How about another place where it is stated that Christ was hanged from a tree. Acts 5:30  \"The God of our fathers raised Jesus whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.\" and Acts 10:39  \"They put him to death by hanging him on a tree...\" (Notice it says hanging on a tree  and not from a tree). But when we look to the same author in Acts 2:36  he says \"Let all the house of Isreal therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.\" and again in Acts 4:10 \"...be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead...\"\n \n Furthermore, why do all of the gospels contain dialogue of Jesus as he is crucified? Once someone is hanged I wouldn't think they would be able to talk anymore. Also, read John 20:25  where Thomas states \"Unless I see the nail marks in his hands   and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.\" Nail marks from a hanging? I also wonder why Matthew 27:40  contains the ridiculing statement, \"If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.\"\n \n You see, being hanged on a tree can be a synonym for being crucified--for one is nailed to and hanging from a tree. But being crucified cannot be a synonym for being hanged to death, as in with a noose around one's neck. There is only one way for hanged to be taken--crucified.\n \n \nMithraism was very much a religion, just like Christianity and Islam. As is Hinduism, as was the Egyptian faith. Myths in and of themselves do not a religion make, but all religions are based on myths, or allegories, or stories, etc., Christianity as much as any other.\n\n You think that Christianity is based on myths like any other? Like the animal gods you spoke of above? Like the many gods of polytheism that blended together one with another for those who accepted any and all gods? The person of Jesus seems much different.\n \n \nAs much as Christianity is a \"distortion\" or by-product of several combined influent religions of the area and era of its formation- Judaism, Egyptian polytheism, Mithraism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, etc. Indeed, Judaism borrowed heavily from several sources itself, and in all probablility all these faiths influenced each other. If you would like to see the original laws of Moses, check out Hammurabi's laws, including exact phrases such as \"an eye for an eye\".\n\n On the contrary. Judaism is the religion that forbade acceptance of other gods. It even became violent to prevent the acceptance of the Gods of other cultures. Baal and golden calves and others were very seducing and tempting but the jealous God of the Jews forbade acceptance of the many gods of man.\n \n \nDid you read my posts at all? It is absolutely counterfeit.\n\n FINALLY! I believe this might be the first thing you and I have ever agreed upon! Maybe we should quit here and congratulate ourselves.",

   "Of course not. The first churches were in the homes and catacombs. The Christians were persecuted by the Jews and Romans. It wasn't likely that any church buildings would go up pointing their persecutors to their location. As Christianity was more accepted, cathedrals and churches were a logical progression in worship of God, being that Christianity was founded on the Jewish faith that utilized the Temple as an honor to God (1 Kings 6). \n\n \n Yep as soon as a religion becomes popular it breaks away from the original teachings and starts with the worldly things.\n \n \nJesus was not afraid of church. He was presented by his parents in the temple (Luke 2:27). He had an attraction to the temple as a child (Luke 2:46). He frequently taught and healed in the synagogues Matthew 4:23, 9:35, 13:54. Mark 1:21-23, 1:39, 3:1. You don't believe in all of Jesus' teachings, nor do you believe in the place in which he teaches.\n\n \n Jesus was a Jew and taught where the people were. That doesn&#8217;t mean he meant to establish an organization that holds vast riches and property. He did tell his followers that if they wanted to be perfect to sell what they had.\n \n \nBut if we do restrict our definition of church to group of believers I have no problem with that because the Church also fits that bill. But I must ask, do you participate in activities with a group of believers?\n\n \n Sometimes I do but it has nothing to do with my relationship with God.\n \n \nAre we comparing the intellect of Jesus and Paul? Paul was a follower of Jesus. His writings are helpful in understanding early Christianity.\n\n \n I was comparing the intellect of Jesus and Paul. His writings detract from the teachings of Jesus because they are not nearly as discerning as the teachings of Jesus. And I don&#8217;t think Paul ever considered them inspired from God. They started out as simply letters to different people. The church decided they were inspired of God. I have never understood how the church could consider the writings of a human on an equal par with the teachings of God. \n \n \nActually, the tendency toward being too Pauline is a Protestant problem. The Catholic Church has been the anchor that moderates extremism. It is both Petrine and Pauline. It is a Church of balance.\n\n \n I totally agree that is exactly what the church is. What it should be is following the teachings of Jesus. Instead it does exactly as you say, follow the teachings of Peter and Paul. \n \n \n I am not right. The Church is right. The Church is right because it has been granted that power and authority by God (Matthew 16:18). 2,000 years of steadfast teaching is right. All of what I say is under the authority of the Church. There is nothing wrong with saying people are wrong.\n\n \n But you are basically saying that what you believe is right and what others believe is wrong. You are just trying to give your beliefs authority through the church.\n \n There is something wrong with saying people are wrong if they are right.\n \n \nWhat do you think the Jews did when they gathered? Do you think before or after someone taught on scripture about God that they might have prayed?\n\n \n I was referring to what Jesus said about praying in private, not what the Jews did.\n \n \n What about scripture being taught in public in the first place? Is that not a form of prayer or worship?\n\n \n Prayer is communicating with God. I don&#8217;t call teaching scripture as communicating with God. \n \n \nJesus must have been calling himself a hypocrite. Matt. 26:44 - Jesus prayed a third time in the garden of Gethsemane, saying the exact same words again. It is not the repetition that is the issue. It's the vanity. \n\n \n That&#8217;s ludicrous. Jesus was praying in agony about his impending torture and his disciples were asleep. Besides I think you know that I am talking about praying as communicating with God. You can be in anywhere and pray. Jesus was talking about praying out loud to a group of people and repeating the same prayer just to impress people. I don&#8217;t understand how you can have so much trouble with this. It&#8217;s simply a matter of being fake or being sincere. Repeating a prayer over and over that someone else wrote is meaningless.\n \n \nHe also told us to pray using the words of the Our Father. Can we only say it one time in our life? How many times is repetition?\n\n \n When it becomes so rote that it becomes meaningless.\n \n \nYou are misinterpreting the words of Jesus.\n\n \n Not quite.\n \n \n It was not one of many. It was THE ONE from which many came. There is a difference.\n\n \n Look you may not like it that it falls under the definition of denomination but I showed you the definition. If you want to argue the point, show me how it differs from the definition.\n \n \nYou are truly blessed. I wouldn't throw all of the insight of man away. After all you did say that you believe in the teachings of a \"man\" called Jesus. Some of them anyway. But we must attempt to discern the truth among these teachings of men as you are attempting to do. \n\n \n Yes I am blessed but not because I follow the teachings of Jesus about partitioning the Holy Spirit for answers. That is available to everyone as he taught.\n \n You are looking to the teachings of men and trying to discern between them. You just happened to pick the men in the Catholic Church. Others pick men in other denominations. I am doing what Jesus said to do. Go directly to the Holy Spirit.",

   "Hank,\n \nYep as soon as a religion becomes popular it breaks away from the original teachings and starts with the worldly things.\n\n Yep, the Christian religion is supposed to be popular. It's for the populace. Some call it universal. It's for everyone. That's why Jesus said to go out and make disciples of all nations. The original teachings are found in the Church not an individual. Teachers, saints, bishops, lay men all contribute but their teachings are subject to the teaching of the Church--the original Revelation of God. No one can have his own agenda and distort. No one can infuse his own ideas if they are not in accord with the original teachings. Your ideas are not in accord with the original teachings. \n \n Worldly things are not the end, simply the means to the end. We must live in the world but not be of the world.\n \n \nJesus was a Jew and taught where the people were. That doesn't mean he meant to establish an organization that holds vast riches and property. He did tell his followers that if they wanted to be perfect to sell what they had.\n\n Much of those vast riches is art created in praise of God. Yet more is land and property used to serve the people. The Catholic Church is one of the largest charitable organizations in the world--it was the largest not so long ago. The monk and friar who gives up all is just as welcome in the Church as the bishop who lives in the diocesan house who must function administratively. The Church is all things to all men.\n \n \nSometimes I do but it has nothing to do with my relationship with God.\n\n It is a reflection of your relationship with God and a component of that relationship. Jesus' greatest command was to love God with our whole heart, mind, and soul. His second one was like the first--love your neighbor as yourself. Love is expressed by praying together, worshipping together, discussing God together, interacting with those who share your beliefs, etc.\n \n \nI was comparing the intellect of Jesus and Paul. His writings detract from the teachings of Jesus because they are not nearly as discerning as the teachings of Jesus. And I don't think Paul ever considered them inspired from God. They started out as simply letters to different people. The church decided they were inspired of God. I have never understood how the church could consider the writings of a human on an equal par with the teachings of God. \n \n You would have to tell me what you consider the teachings of God to be. Most consider the scriptures to be the teachings of God. Jesus did. He taught scripture. \n \n Matthew 22:29  Jesus replied, \"You are in error because  you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.\"\n \n Luke 24:27  And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. \n \n Luke 24:32 They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" \n \n Luke 24:45  \"Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.\" He opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures. He did not open their mind so that they could throw away the scriptures. The Spirit is needed but so are the scriptures.\n \n And I'm not so sure Paul did not consider his letters as inspired from God.\n 2 Timothy 3:16  \"All Scripture is God*breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.\" Now he was probably talking about Old Testament scripture but what did he believe of his own work?\n \n Romans 9:1 \"I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit.\" It seems that you are not the only one to whom the Spirit speaks.\n \n 2 Corinthians 5:20  \"So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us.\" God has always used men to convey his message. Not their own message but his message. That is why it is useful to listen to wise, holy men that teach in accord with the Revelation of God. God grants them this.\n \n \nI totally agree that is exactly what the church is. What it should be is following the teachings of Jesus. Instead it does exactly as you say, follow the teachings of Peter and Paul. \n \n It follows the teachings of Jesus and those whom Jesus himself appointed to continue his message when he left earth. One cannot follow the teachings of Peter and Paul without following the teachings of Jesus. They are one and the same--that is evident in their writings.\n \n \nBut you are basically saying that what you believe is right and what others believe is wrong. You are just trying to give your beliefs authority through the church.\n\n \"My\" beliefs are not my own. \"My\" beliefs are the Church's. \"My\" beliefs are Christ's. I have never attempted to give \"my\" beliefs authority. \"My\" (Catholic) beliefs have the authority that Christ gave them through the Church whom Christ gave authority (Matthew 16:18). \n \n \nThere is something wrong with saying people are wrong if they are right.\n\n When have I said that someone was wrong when they were right?\n \n \nI was referring to what Jesus said about praying in private, not what the Jews did.\n\n Jesus was with the Jews at the sermon on the mount, and in many other instances when he taught groups of Jews scripture.\n \n \nPrayer is communicating with God. I don't call teaching scripture as communicating with God. \n \n See the above remarks about Jesus' belief in teaching scripture (and one can even consider his willful action to fulfill scripture).\n \n \nThat's ludicrous. Jesus was praying in agony about his impending torture and his disciples were asleep. Besides I think you know that I am talking about praying as communicating with God. You can be in anywhere and pray. Jesus was talking about praying out loud to a group of people and repeating the same prayer just to impress people. I don't understand how you can have so much trouble with this. It's simply a matter of being fake or being sincere. Repeating a prayer over and over that someone else wrote is meaningless.\n\n I'm glad you agree that it would be ludicrous to call Jesus a hypocrite and to accuse him of vain repetition.\n \n I don't have much trouble with this. I think that praying spontaneously is great and I think that praying from memorization and meditating on the words is great. I think vain repetition is wrong and meaningful repetition is okay. Public prayer to show off in vanity is wrong (as Jesus said), sincere public prayer is perfectly okay and an honor to God. The trick is knowing the difference.\n \n I'm not sure how you know if repeating a prayer over that someone else wrote is meaningless to the person saying it. Does the spirit help you discern this? You also were able to determine the hearts and thoughts of those praying at football games and declared their prayers meaningless. I don't understand why you have so much trouble with other peoples' prayer lives.\n \n \nYou are looking to the teachings of men and trying to discern between them. You just happened to pick the men in the Catholic Church. Others pick men in other denominations. I am doing what Jesus said to do. Go directly to the Holy Spirit.\n\n See my comments above about the value of holy, wise men teaching others. I'm still not sure why Jesus called the apostles to him, chose Peter to lead his church, and sent them out to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19) if he did not believe in men as teachers. After all, Jesus told the fishermen apostles that he would make them \"fishers of men.\"\n \n Belief cannot be solely from the Spirit. It must be from the Spirit with Revelation guided by the message bearer, the Church. The Spirit opens our minds to scripture, to Holy Tradition, to the Revelation of God. The Spirit leads us to the Revelation. The Revelation is most fully and truthfully conveyed by the Church.",

   "Jesus is not a representation.

   "Mizmaxx,\n \nWhat do you base that evaluation on? \n \n The Bible, the writings of Josephus, and the writings of Roman historian Tacitus. He mentioned Christ in A.D. 115 in Annals 15.44.\n \n \"Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the Populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty  during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus...\" (emphasis mine) \n \n (See more of this discussion on the \"Did Jesus Christ Exist?\" thread somewhere here in the religion forum where I originally posted the above info. on Tacitus)\n \n (Also, notice that Tacitus mentioned that Jesus suffered the \"extreme penalty.\" This may also speak to our hanging/crucifixion argument. What was the extreme penalty in Roman culture?)\n \n \nNot directly and uniquely. Christianity came about at a time and place where cults abounded, and major religions intersected.

And is it a coincidence that Horus was said to have raised someone named El Azar Us from the dead, also prior to the CE?

I'm not sure if that's a version of the King James or not. It was the quickest translation I had access to for posting. Catholics for the most part do not use the KJV, it is mainly a Protestant translation. \n \n But the translation shouldn't matter that much in my argument. I acknowledged the verses that did say Jesus was hung from a tree. I did not say that other versions didn't say this. My Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition says he was hung from a tree too. But when taken in context it is pretty evident (probably in all translations) that this was another way of saying he was crucified.\n \n \nPaul's writing predate the Gospels- Paul knew nothing of the crucifixion, virgin birth, parables, etc. It doesn't bother you that the story changed as the writing got further away from the date it was supposed to have happened?\n\n To say that Paul new nothing of the crucifixion, virgin birth, and parables, that is of THE GOSPEL (The Good News) is absurdly false. To say he never read the written Gospels  is probably true. He didn't have to read them. He walked and talked with those who were there. He interacted with the apostles as his epistles, Acts and other writings outside of the Bible tell us (he spent time with Peter). He heard the truth from the eyewitness followers of Jesus.\n \n You would have to be more specific on how the story changed for me to respond further.\n \n \nIndeed, he seems different from chapter to chapter of the Gospels. That's because he is a mythic character.\n\n He seems different than animal gods or representations. He does not seem different within the Gospels.

   "What do you base that evaluation on?\n\n \nThe Bible, \n\n None of which was written by Jesus' contemporaries...\n \n \nthe writings of Josephus, \n\n \nJosephus (c37 - 100 AD)\n A native of Judea, living in the 1st century A.D., Josephus was actually governor of Galilee for a time (prior to the war of 70 A.D.) the very province in which Jesus allegedly did his wonders. Though not born until 37 AD. and therefore not a contemporary witness to any Jesus-character, Josephus at one point even lived in Cana, the very city in which Christ is said to have wrought his first miracle.\n \n Josephus's two major tomes are History of The Jewish War and The Antiquities of the Jews. In these complementary works, the former written in the 70s, the latter in the 90s A.D., Josephus mentions every noted personage of Palestine and describes eve\n ry important event which occurred there during the first seventy years of the Christian era.\n\n The passage which I am assuming you refer to as your \"evidence\" is the Testimonium Flavianum. \n \n \nNow, there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.\n\n ? Josephus (aka Joseph ben Matthias) The Antiquities of the Jews, Book 18, Chapter 3: the so called Testimonium Flavianum\n \n To believe that this passsage is not a forgery by later Christians requires either resolving or ignoring the following problems-\n \n a) This passage is the sole mention of Jesus by Josephus in his entire works. In a single paragraph, this devout Jewish man confirms the following Christian beliefs- \n 1. Jesus's existence \n 2. his 'more than human' status \n 3. his miracle working \n 4. his teachings \n 5. his ministry among the Jews and the Gentiles \n 6. his Messiahship \n 7. his condemnation by the Jewish priests \n 8. his sentence by Pilate \n 9. his death on the cross \n 10. the devotion of his followers \n 11. his resurrection on the 3rd day \n 12. his post-death appearance \n 13. his fulfillment of divine prophesy \n 14. the successful continuance of the Christians\n \n It seems odd to me that a devout Jew should randomly admit that the Messiah has come, and been resurrected. Perhaps if this passage had referred to Jesus as a fraud it would be more believeable, but as it stands it seems more like something written by a Christian.\n \n How could Josephus stay an Orthodox Jew if he believed the Messiah had come? Why did he only give the Messiah a single paragraph? How is it that the paragraph states no additional information that people closer to co\n ntemporaries of Jesus would have known, only exactly what is contained in the Gospels, nothing more?\n \n b) Not a single writer before the 4th century not Justin, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Cyprian, Arnobius, etc. in all their defences against pagan hostility, makes a single reference to Josephus' wondrous words. Why would they leave this out, unless it did not yet exist?\n \n \nThe third century Church 'Father' Origen, for example, spent half his life and a quarter of a million words contending against the pagan writer Celsus. Origen drew on all sorts of proofs and witnesses to his arguments in his fierce defence of Christianity. He quotes from Josephus extensively. Yet even he makes no reference to this 'golden paragraph' from Josephus, which would have been the ultimate rebuttal. In fact, Origen actually said that Josephus was \"not believing in Jesus as the Christ.\"\n \n It was absent from early copies of the works of Josephus and did not appear in Origen's third century version of Josephus, referenced in his Contra Celsum.\n \n\n \n c) The passage is out of context. \nBook 18 starts with the Roman taxation under Cyrenius in 6 AD, talks about various Jewish sects at the time, including the Essenes, and a sect of Judas the Galilean. He discusses Herod's building of various cities, the succession of priests and procurators, and so on.\n \n Chapter 3 starts with a sedition against Pilate who planned to slaughter all the Jews but changed his mind. Pilate then used sacred money to supply water to Jerusalem, and the Jews protested. Pilate sent spies among the Jews with concealed weapons, and there was a great massacre.\n \n Then comes the paragraph about Jesus, and immediately after it, Josephus continues:\n \n 'And about the same time another terrible misfortune confounded the Jews . ..'\n \n Josephus, an orthodox Jew, would not have thought the Christian story to be 'another terrible misfortune.' It is only a Christian who would have considered this to be a Jewish tragedy.\n\n \n d) The paragraph contains the phrase \"to this day\", which suggests it was written later, as there was no \"tribe of Christians\" during Josephus' time.\n \n e) The hyperbolic writing style is completely uncharacteristic of the historian-\n '. . . as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him . . .' It just doesn't sound to me like anyone but a Christian could have written those passages. In fact, the writing style is completely consistent with Christian propaganda.\n \n f) Bishop Eusebius, the first person to mention this paragraph at about 340 CE, was open about forging and lying \"for God\"... He titled his 32nd Chapter of his 12th Book of Evangelical Preparation: \"How it may be Lawful and Fitting to use Falsehood as a Medicine, and for the Benefit of those who Want to be Deceived.\" He was also responsible for forging the \"Letters from Emperor Antoninus Pius to the Greeks\".\n \n Then again, maybe you are referring to the actual and unforged \"Jamesian\" reference, in which case you should know that this refers to Jesus ben Damneus, the son of a High Priest. \n \n \nand the writings of Roman historian Tacitus. He mentioned Christ in A.D. 115 in Annals 15.44.\n\n \n \nNero looked around for a scapegoat, and inflicted the most fiendish tortures on a group of persons already hated for their crimes. This was the sect known as Christians. Their founder, one Christus, had been put to death by the procurator, Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius. This checked the abominable superstition for a while, but it broke out again and spread, not merely through Judea, where it originated, but even to Rome itself, the great reservoir and collecting ground for every kind of depravity and filth. Those who confessed to being Christians were at once arrested, but on their testimony a great crowd of people were convicted, not so much on the charge of arson, but of hatred of the entire human race.\n(Book 15, chapter 44)\n \n If this is not a forgery, it was still written long after Christ's supposed death. However, it is also questionable in origin-\n \n a) During the time of Nero, there was no group known as \"Christians\". Christians as a distinct group from the Jews appear only late in the 1st century, not long before the Jewish curse on heretics at the council of Jamnia (around 85 C.E.). The label 'Christian' itself only appears with the 2nd century Acts with the story that the term 'began in Antioch' (11.26) There would not have been \"a great crowd\" of Christians at the time either.\n \n b) As with the Josephus passage, early Christian writers were silent about this paragraph until it appears almost word-for-word in the early 5th century writings of Sulpicius Severus, where it is mixed in with other myths. Severus is responsible for several other forgeries and lies, such as that Nero was an arsonist who \"fiddled as Rome burned\"- even though historically it is known that Nero was actually in his native town of Anteum at the time.\n \n \nTo say that Paul new nothing of the crucifixion, virgin birth, and parables, that is of THE GOSPEL (The Good News) is absurdly false. To say he never read the written Gospels is probably true. He didn't have to read them. He walked and talked with those who were there. He interacted with the apostles as his epistles, Acts and other writings outside of the Bible tell us (he spent time with Peter). He heard the truth from the eyewitness followers of Jesus.\n\n That isn't what he says-\n \"The Gospel which was preached of me is not after man, for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it\" (Gal. i, II, 12)\n \n Paul supposedly saw a vision, an apparition of Jesus. He did not believe in physical resurrection as described in the Gospels- \"But not is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead\" (I Cor. xv, 20, 21). \"But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die; and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be\" (35-37). \"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body\" (44). \"Now this I say brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God\" (50).\n \n He declares of Jesus \"which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;\"(Rom. i, 3, 4) \"God sent forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law\" (Gal. iv, 4) does that sound to you like a description of a virgin birth?\n \n Of the several chapters of the NT which were supposed to have been written by Paul, the only ones which are generally accepted as genuine are Romans, First and Second Corinthians, and Galatians. \n \n Nowhere does Paul, in all his letters to the Christians, mention or refer to any of the teachings or parables of the Gospels. Although the Gospels seem to evidence Christ's divinity through numerous \"miracles\", Paul speaks only of the resurrection and the \"gifts\" of faith. Paul speaks of Jesus' murderer naming Satan, not the Romans. He warns the Christians in Romans not to disobey the Romans, saying that they do not punish the righteous!\n \n About the supposed apostle Simon (Peter), whom Paul \"spent time with\", I invite you to read the following essay- [url=http://home.inu.net/skeptic/peter.html]here[/quote]. 1st and 2nd Peter are clearly forgeries written in the second century.",

Personally, I keep finding an abundance of evidence existed. Paul for instance you agree existed. There is historical evidence that he was indeed a pharisee and studied under Gamaliel. His conversion is well documented and a number of the people with whom he worshipped on his travels have written concerning some of the things he wrote. \n \n If what he believed was simply a concoction, why would he be willing to be beaten, jailed, run out of town, and eventually beheaded for such a concoction?\n \n Not to mention, the content of the Gospels and the rest of the Bible would seem to point away from men making it up. Why? Because if a man made it up, he would have made man the focus. He would have made man the hero with the ability to overcome. Or to make things hopeless. That is the nature of the way we think apart from God. The bible clearly states that man does not have what it takes to deal with the problem of sin. Only God does. And only by man's dependence on God can sin be overcome in a man. It is not an easy thing. Simple, but not easy.\n \n Jesus is mentioned in the writings of Josephus. While Josephus is noted as being extremely biased in his writings, he was not a christian and his historical detail is accurate. There are many documents written concerning the gospels within a decade or two of the death of Jesus. Some of Pauls writings were written in asia and show up in Africa less than 10 years later. There has been more archaeological, paleontological , historical study of the Bible than any other document, by far. There is more documentary evidence for the bible than for any other document (by far) that is generally considered authentic and accurate. \n \n All of that said, it is not why I believe the gospels and the bible in general to be true. It is God Himself. I believe, because, once upon a time I decided to try God at his word. I believed. God has yet to let me down. It is His action in my life, not the above mentioned evidence.",

   "Yep, the Christian religion is supposed to be popular. It's for the populace. Some call it universal. It's for everyone. That's why Jesus said to go out and make disciples of all nations.\n\n \n It is for the populace but it certainly is not supposed to be popular. Jesus said his way was narrow and not many would follow. So if your religion is popular, it's a sure sign you're not following the teachings of Jesus.\n \n \nThe original teachings are found in the Church not an individual. Teachers, saints, bishops, lay men all contribute but their teachings are subject to the teaching of the Church--the original Revelation of God. No one can have his own agenda and distort. No one can infuse his own ideas if they are not in accord with the original teachings. Your ideas are not in accord with the original teachings. \n\n \n I know you depend on the church. We've been over that numerous times. For me the original teachings are the teachings of Jesus, not the teachings of the church. And what the church says about them or what Peter or Paul or anyone else says about them is just information to me. If Jesus was God as you believe, he doesn't need the church to explain what he wanted to say. Unless your god is not capable of giving his message while he was here on earth. My ideas are in accord with the teachings of Jesus which point to the Holy Spirit for guidance and inspiration. So as long as you keep repeating that God wants people to look at the church, I will keep repeating that God wants people to look to the Holy Spirit.\n \n \nWorldly things are not the end, simply the means to the end. We must live in the world but not be of the world.\n\n \n Well if Jesus said to sell what you own, what are you going to use for worldly things?\n \n \nMuch of those vast riches is art created in praise of God. Yet more is land and property used to serve the people. The Catholic Church is one of the largest charitable organizations in the world--it was the largest not so long ago. The monk and friar who gives up all is just as welcome in the Church as the bishop who lives in the diocesan house who must function administratively.\n\n \n It doesn't matter how much you give but how much do you have left. Jesus pointed that out with the widow that gave the mite. \n \n [quote] The Church is all things to all men.[quote]\n \n Sounds like a political race.\n \n \nIt is a reflection of your relationship with God and a component of that relationship. Jesus' greatest command was to love God with our whole heart, mind, and soul. His second one was like the first--love your neighbor as yourself. Love is expressed by praying together, worshipping together, discussing God together, interacting with those who share your beliefs, etc.\n\n \n It is not a reflection of my relationship with God. If I never attended a church, I would have the same relationship with God as I have now. I don't need a church to have a relationship with God.\n \n I apparently don't express love as you do. For me love is caring about and helping people, not praying with them. They don't need me to communicate with God and vice versa.\n \n \nYou would have to tell me what you consider the teachings of God to be. Most consider the scriptures to be the teachings of God.\n\n \n That's not true.\n \n \n Jesus did. He taught scripture. \n\n \n You may be right about that. However using something as evidence of authority does not necessarily mean you think it is the word of God. But the bigger issue for you is that the New Testament did not exist when Jesus was talking about scripture so he couldn't have been talking about that. And Jesus said you couldn't put new wine in old wineskins.\n \n Also I often use the New Testament to prove a point with someone who believes the New Testament is the word of God. That doesn't mean I believe it is the word of God.\n \n \nAnd I'm not so sure Paul did not consider his letters as inspired from God.\n\n \n I'm not either. When I said I didn't think Paul consider his letters as the word of God I meant it as I'm not sure what he considered.\n \n \nIt seems that you are not the only one to whom the Spirit speaks.\n\n \n I have stated quite often that Jesus taught the Holy Spirit was available to anyone that applied.\n \n \n2 Corinthians 5:20 \"So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us.\" God has always used men to convey his message. Not their own message but his message. That is why it is useful to listen to wise, holy men that teach in accord with the Revelation of God. God grants them this.\n\n \n Yes but you would think that when God himself came along with a message, you would put the others aside and listen to him. How can holy men compare to God himself?\n \n \nIt follows the teachings of Jesus and those whom Jesus himself appointed to continue his message when he left earth. One cannot follow the teachings of Peter and Paul without following the teachings of Jesus. They are one and the same--that is evident in their writings.\n\n \n They are not one and the same by a long shot.\n \n \n\"My\" beliefs are not my own. \"My\" beliefs are the Church's. \"My\" beliefs are Christ's. I have never attempted to give \"my\" beliefs authority. \"My\" (Catholic) beliefs have the authority that Christ gave them through the Church whom Christ gave authority (Matthew 16:18). \n\n \n LOL. You and the Protestants have been arguing about that verse for 500 years.\n \n It's interesting that the word church is only used in the gospels twice, and both try to give credence to Jesus establishing a church. Most reasonable people look at that and are suspicious.\n \n \n \nWhen have I said that someone was wrong when they were right?\n\n \n If you are wrong, then they may be right.\n \n \nJesus was with the Jews at the sermon on the mount, and in many other instances when he taught groups of Jews scripture.\n\n \n What has that got to do with praying in private?\n \n \nSee the above remarks about Jesus' belief in teaching scripture (and one can even consider his willful action to fulfill scripture).\n\n \n See the above remarks about Jesus' belief in teaching scripture. :)\n \n \nI'm glad you agree that it would be ludicrous to call Jesus a hypocrite and to accuse him of vain repetition.\n\n \n Cute but you know exactly what I was calling ludicrous and you didn't address it.\n \n \nI don't have much trouble with this. I think that praying spontaneously is great and I think that praying from memorization and meditating on the words is great. I think vain repetition is wrong and meaningful repetition is okay. Public prayer to show off in vanity is wrong (as Jesus said), sincere public prayer is perfectly okay and an honor to God. The trick is knowing the difference.\n\n \n It's not a trick for me since I don't pray in public or repetitive prayers. :)\n \n \nI'm not sure how you know if repeating a prayer over that someone else wrote is meaningless to the person saying it. Does the spirit help you discern this? You also were able to determine the hearts and thoughts of those praying at football games and declared their prayers meaningless.\n\n \n Please. Do you need the spirit to discern every time you hear someone saying something that is insincere? \n \n \nI don't understand why you have so much trouble with other peoples' prayer lives.\n\n I have no trouble with other peoples' prayer lives. It doesn't bother me. I was just pointing out what Jesus said about public prayer after you brought it up. You're the only one that seems to have the problem.\n \n \nSee my comments above about the value of holy, wise men teaching others. I'm still not sure why Jesus called the apostles to him, chose Peter to lead his church, and sent them out to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19) if he did not believe in men as teachers. After all, Jesus told the fishermen apostles that he would make them \"fishers of men.\"\n\n \n Men are teachers. They should teach others to look to the Holy Spirit for answers.\n \n \nBelief cannot be solely from the Spirit.\n\n \n Yes it can.\n \n \nIt must be from the Spirit with Revelation guided by the message bearer, the Church.\n\n \n Jesus was the message bearer, not the church.\n \n \n The Spirit opens our minds to scripture, to Holy Tradition, to the Revelation of God. The Spirit leads us to the Revelation. The Revelation is most fully and truthfully conveyed by the Church.\n\n \n You have it backwards. Jesus said he would send the Holy Spirit, not other men or a church. The revelation is most fully and truthfully conveyed by the Holy Spirit. You have replaced the Holy Spirit with the church.",

   "Mizzmax's amusing website.\n http://home.inu.net/skeptic/peter.html]here \n \nThe apostle Peter is surpassed in importance in the Christian religion only by Jesus and the apostle Paul. However, sources of information concerning him are limited to the New Testament2 There are no references to him in any contemporary secular or religious documents.\n\n \n Peter's writership is established by the opening words. Moreover, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian all quote the letter, naming Peter as writer. The authenticity of First Peter is as well attested as any of the inspired letters. Eusebius tells us that the elders of the church made free use of the letter; there was no question as to its authenticity in his time (c. 260-342 C.E.). Ignatius, Hermas, and Barnabas, of the early second century, all make references to it. First Peter is completely in harmony with the rest of the inspired Scriptures and sets out a powerful message for the Jewish and non-Jewish Christians residing as \"temporary residents scattered about in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia\"-regions of Asia Minor.-1 Pet. 1:1.\n \nOut of the many incidents in which Peter figures prominently in the gospels, two, the \"denial,\" and the \"ordination,\" are among the best known and therefore deserve close scrutiny. First, let us consider Peter's denial of Christ. Of all of the New Testament stories, that of Peter's denial (Mark 14:66-72 and parallels) is one of the most well known. In summary it says that following Jesus' arrest by agents of the chief priest Peter is identified by three people as being one of Jesus' followers. Peter vehemently denies this accusation rejecting Jesus in the process. After the third denial a XXXX crows for the second time, and Peter suddenly remembers Jesus predicting that he would deny him three times err the XXXX crows twice (Mark 14:3). Peter wept. This story has provided the text for many sermons and Sunday School lessons, but did it really happen?\n\n I always love this one! Think about it! How many of the other \"faithful\" disciples were actually there to deny Christ? er none. Which kinnda elevates Peter slightly don't ya think?\n \nPaul discusses his jurisdictional dispute with Peter in Galatians, considered by most Bible scholars to be authentic3. His failure to mention Peter's denial of Christ is highly significant. \n \n Why? Give me some sound scriptural reason why God should always remind someone of his or her fallings. Please, I've not found any reason yet!!!\n \nPaul's position as leader of the Christian community at Antioch had been challenged by Peter. As part of his defense Paul calls Peter a hypocrite (Gal. 2:11-13). In that regard, the denial coupled with Matthew 10:33 where Jesus warns, \"But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven,\" would have been a powerful argument he could have used against Peter. Paul's silence in this matter stands as reliable evidence that the denial story is a late Christian forgery.\n\n Not quite! Paul resisted a possible temptation to resort to damaging gossip when he reproved Peter, who had been ashamed to eat with Gentile believers and associate with them because of the presence of certain Jewish Christians from Jerusalem. Instead of talking about Peter behind his back, Paul \"resisted him face to face,\" speaking up \"before them all.\" (Galatians 2:11-14) Peter did not gossip about his reprover either. In fact, he later referred to him as \"our beloved brother Paul.\" (2 Peter 3:15) \n \nIn Hebrews 6:4-6 we are told that denial of scripture is an unforgivable sin. Once scripture is rejected there can be no second chance. Therefore, the author of Hebrews could not have been aware of the story of Peter's denial because if he had he surely would have made an exception for it. Thus, we have more evidence of forgery.\n\n Duh! Mizzmax there needs to be more research into the scriptures from your point of view. You need to go along way to be unforgivable. Peters denial of Christ comes nowhere near that field. \n \nIn Matthew 16:17-19 Jesus personally appoints Peter to be his earthly successor and to found his church. In fact, the recognition by the Roman Catholic church of Peter as the first pope is based on this passage. But there are problems, big problems. First, although it stands as an act of the utmost importance to Christianity, not only is the ordination of Peter not mentioned in the other gospels, it is mentioned nowhere else in the entire New Testament. Excluding this passage, \n \n Why should it be?\n \nJesus made no attempt to establish a church.\n\n Are you sure? Mizzmax.\n \nHis eschatological expectations seem to reduce to absurdity such a project. He prophesied that the world would end within the lifetime of his contemporaries4.\n \n Sorry! I must of missed that prophecy, silly me. Can you show me where it is?\n \nSecond, although Mark and Luke do not contain the ordination, they do contain duplicates of Matthew 16:16 and Matthew 16:20, the verses immediately preceding and following the ordination.\n\n I miss the point!\n \nThird, the use of the word \"church\" suggests a level of organization acquired only at a much later period.\n \n Again the early church was very organised, something that latter churches gain their organisational techniques. Why weren't they organized? \n \nLast, but by no means least, not only does Peter not refer to the ordination in his dispute with Paul, he never mentions it in 1st & 2nd Peter, the epistles he allegedly wrote.\n\n Why should he?????? How could this benefit the congregation?\n \nFirst and Second Peter, although allegedly written by the great apostle, are strangely silent regarding some very important events in which, according to the gospels, he figured prominently. Peter was a close confidant of Jesus throughout most of his ministry. Yet, the only mention he makes of this important association is a brief statement in 1st Peter 5:1. Perhaps Jesus' most amazing miracle was walking on water. Peter played an important part in it and even walked on the water with him (Matthew 14:29). Yet, for some strange reason, Peter forgot to mention this astounding feat in his epistles.\n\n What you seem to suggest is that when people achieve something that no other human being can, then we should rub everyone else's nose in it. I think you're on your own on that one my good man!\n \nThe fact is that 1st & 2nd Peter are recognized forgeries. According to Burton L. Mack5 both epistles bear the unmistakable marks of second century authorship and erudition. Mack points out that these epistles fit well with other Christian literature of the mid-second century, and scholars have traditionally assigned them a date of between 124 CE and 150 CE. Peter, if he existed at all, is believed to have died about 67 CE6. According to the church father, Tertullian7, writing more than 140 years after the alleged event, he was crucified in Rome. However, Tertullian also claimed, in the same paragraph, that the Apostle John came out unharmed after being plunged into a vat of boiling oil, so Tertullian's veracity is highly questionable. \n \n Quotes (WBTS)\n 3 When was the letter written? Its tone indicates that the Christians were experiencing trials, either from the pagans or from unconverted Jews, but that Nero's campaign of persecution, launched in 64 C.E., had not yet begun. It is evident that Peter wrote the letter just prior to this, probably between 62 and 64 C.E. Mark's still being with Peter strengthens this conclusion. During Paul's first imprisonment at Rome (c. 59-61 C.E.), Mark was with Paul but was due to travel to Asia Minor; and at the time of Paul's second imprisonment (c. 65 C.E.), Mark was about to join Paul again in Rome. (1 Pet. 5:13; Col. 4:10; 2 Tim. 4:11) In the interval he would have had the opportunity to be with Peter in Babylon.\n 4 Where was First Peter written? Whereas Bible commentators agree on the authenticity, canonicity, writership, and approximate date of writing, they differ as to the place of writing. According to Peter's own testimony, he wrote his first letter while at Babylon. (1 Pet. 5:13) But some claim that he wrote from Rome, saying that \"Babylon\" was a cryptic name for Rome. The evidence, however, does not support such a view. Nowhere does the Bible indicate that Babylon specifically refers to Rome. Since Peter addressed his letter to those in literal Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, it logically follows that his reference to Babylon was to the literal place of that name. (1:1) There was good reason for Peter to be in Babylon. He was entrusted with 'the good news for those who are circumcised,' and there was a large Jewish population in Babylon. (Gal. 2:7-9) The Encyclopaedia Judaica, when discussing the production of the Babylonian Talmud, refers to Judaism's \"great academies of Babylon\" during the Common Era.\n 5 The inspired Scriptures, including the two letters written by Peter, make no mention of his going to Rome. Paul speaks of being in Rome but never refers to Peter's being there. Although Paul mentions 35 names in his letter to the Romans and sends greetings by name to 26, why does he fail to mention Peter? Simply because Peter was not there at the time! (Rom. 16:3-15) The \"Babylon\" from which Peter wrote his first letter was evidently the literal Babylon on the banks of the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia.\n Mizzmax you need to search the web harder to find real reasons why your case is true!!!\n Richard,",

   "Hey Hank:\n \n I didn't read your whole post, sorry it was too much for me. But this paragraph caught my eye.\n\n \n Hi EF\n \n You don&#8217;t have time to read my whole post? Sounds like you need to get your priorities in order. :)\n \n \nI certainly wonder about this. I know Jesus contrasted the ways of the world and the ways of heaven. It is quite possible that the \"popular church\" is really NOT of the church. Much of the christian church has turned away from Jesus and his teaching and instead follow a different path of diversity, tolerance, and all the days's buzz words. Jesus most certainly spoke against this. \n\n \n Looks like we agree on this one, although probably for different reasons.\n \n \nI still take exception to your interpretation of Jesus saying \"Go sell all you have.\" It is the discussion that started this thread. We seem not to have changed either's mind on the issue. So I won't argue it further. Which pretty much means you can ignore this paragraph if you want. \n\n \n Another agree to disagree. We agree on the really important stuff from my part if not from yours.\n \n \nHope you are doing well.\n\n \n Yep doing good.

   "Hank,\n \nI know you depend on the church. We've been over that numerous times. For me the original teachings are the teachings of Jesus, not the teachings of the church. And what the church says about them or what Peter or Paul or anyone else says about them is just information to me.\n\n Yes, and I know, that for you, the teachings of Jesus are the teachings that you pick to be the teachings of Jesus. You don't need Peter or Paul or the Church because you have set yourself up as sole arbiter of the truth.\n \n \n \nIf Jesus was God as you believe, he doesn't need the church to explain what he wanted to say. Unless your god is not capable of giving his message while he was here on earth. \n \n Jesus doesn't need  the Church nor does God. They chose  the Church as the most efficacious means to their end.\n \n \nMy ideas are in accord with the teachings of Jesus which point to the Holy Spirit for guidance and inspiration. So as long as you keep repeating that God wants people to look at the church, I will keep repeating that God wants people to look to the Holy Spirit.\n\n They are in accord with the teachings concerning the Holy Spirit but not in accord with his other teachings. It should not be \"either/or\" but rather \"both/and.\" It should be a comprehensive belief not a one sided belief.\n \n \nWell if Jesus said to sell what you own, what are you going to use for worldly things?\n\n Jesus also told the apostles to go to peoples homes and ask their hospitality. He did not tell the apostles to make those people sell all of their belongings. Some material things are required and some people are required to keep those material things to utilize them for the Kingdom.\n \n \nIt doesn't matter how much you give but how much do you have left. Jesus pointed that out with the widow that gave the mite. \n\n Or maybe it matters what is in your heart when you give. \n \n \nThe Church is all things to all men.\n\n \n \nSounds like a political race.\n\n \n 1 Corinthians 9:22\n \n \nIt is not a reflection of my relationship with God. If I never attended a church, I would have the same relationship with God as I have now. I don't need a church to have a relationship with God.\n\n This is an issue that we cannot debate much further as we would get into the necessity of the sacraments that the Church administers that I know you do not believe in. But I still insist that a Church is required because it is evident that Jesus believed in a community of belief and you need to have a relationship with others to have a relationship with God--the most appropriate place--church.\n \n \nI apparently don't express love as you do. For me love is caring about and helping people, not praying with them. They don't need me to communicate with God and vice versa.\n\n But wouldn't it be great to pray with someone you love?\n \n \nThat's not true.\n\n I meant most Christians.\n \n \nI have stated quite often that Jesus taught the Holy Spirit was available to anyone that applied.\n\n But you think the Church became a Pauline church and not a Jesus church. Was the Spirit lying to Paul?\n \n \nYes but you would think that when God himself came along with a message, you would put the others aside and listen to him. How can holy men compare to God himself?\n\n Men do not compare with God...UNTIL...God puts himself on earth as a man...a full man/full God...Jesus. Then we must respect God's decision to communicate with us by using our own nature that he created. We do not put aside God to listen to men. We listen to God through men--as Paul said, God making his appeal through us. Paul does not claim to be God or to put God aside. Paul humbles himself and acknowledges himself as a tool of God.\n \n \nThey are not one and the same by a long shot.\n\n Why not? The Spirit guided Paul.\n \n \nLOL. You and the Protestants have been arguing about that verse for 500 years.\n\n But the thing is that the issue does not rest on that one verse. There is a mountain of other evidence that supports Peter's primacy.\n \n \nIt's interesting that the word church is only used in the gospels twice, and both try to give credence to Jesus establishing a church. Most reasonable people look at that and are suspicious.\n\n Most people might. But I look at it with confidence. If there was a real push to establish a church after the fact it would be all over the gospels in a very overt and ostentatious way. It would not be in the subtlety of two not so subtle verses. It is because of the casual but direct mention of the church that we can be assured that it was not contrived.\n \n \nCute but you know exactly what I was calling ludicrous and you didn't address it.\n\n Actually I totally missed it. Please explain.\n \n \nJesus was the message bearer, not the church.\n\n \n \nYou have it backwards. Jesus said he would send the Holy Spirit, not other men or a church. The revelation is most fully and truthfully conveyed by the Holy Spirit. You have replaced the Holy Spirit with the church.\n\n I have it the way Jesus had it.\n \n Luke 10:16  \"He who hears you hears me, and he who rejects you rejects me, and he who rejects him who sent me.\"\n \n Matthew 28:18-20  \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe ALL that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.\"\n \n (Also, keep in mind that when Jesus said he would send the Holy Spirit that he was talking to the apostles. He was talking to his Church.)",

   "Eusebius tells us that the elders of the church made free use of the letter; there was no question as to its authenticity in his time (c. 260-342 C.E.)\n\n Eusebius is an admitted \"liar for God\". His testimony is worthless. He created forgeries, such as the 'Letters' of Emperor Antoninus Pius to the Greeks. I think being an author of forgeries makes him a questionable witness, to say the least.\n \n \n Why? Give me some sound scriptural reason why God should always remind someone of his or her fallings. \n\n Not God, but Paul. They were arguing about who was a hypocrite, so it's a bit of a glaring omission that Paul would be kind enough not to mention that Paul had denied the Christ! \n \n \nPaul resisted a possible temptation to resort to damaging gossip when he reproved Peter\n\n So the Gospels are \"gossip\" now? In any case, if Paul was trying to keep from destroying Peter's reputation, he should then have defended those actions rather than been silent about them, as the other believers would otherwise do the math themselves. Unless, of course, it didn't happen.\n \n \n Why should it be?\n\n It's a pretty important thing to omit. Especially as the Gospels were not written to be read together, but seperately, such that leaving it out means that lots of people would not know that Peter was supposed to be the Church's foundation.\n \n \n Sorry! I must of missed that prophecy, silly me. Can you show me where it is?\n\n When there's a little number in superscript at the end of a sentence, it's usually a footnote reference. As here, where it references this page-\n http://home.inu.net/skeptic/lie.html \n The following quotes confirm that Jesus deliberately lead his followers into false expectations.\n \n Matthew 10:23 - When giving instructions to his apostles as to just how they are to go about spreading his message Jesus says,.\" . . . for truly I say unto you, you shall not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.\"\n \n Matthew 16:28 - Jesus says to his disciples, \"There are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\"\n \n Matthew 24:33-34 - After prophesying a wide assortment of events including the second coming, Jesus said to his disciples, \" . . . when you shall see all these things, know that it (the 2nd coming) is near, even at the door. This generation shall not pass till these things be fulfilled.\" He was obviously referring to the contemporary generation.\n \n Matthew 26:64 - When brought before Caiaphas, the Chief Priest, Jesus said to him, \"I tell you, hereafter you shall see the Son of Man . . . coming on the clouds of heaven.\" According to this the second coming was to happen during Caiaphas' lifetime.\n \n Mark 9:1 - Jesus said to the people and to his disciples, ?Verily I say unto you, that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.\n \n Luke 21:27-28 -Jesus said to the congregation, ?And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.?\n \n Luke 21:32 - Jesus said, again to the congregation, ?This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.?\n \n I Thessalonians 4:15-17 - In his first Epistle to the Thessalonians Paul assures the congregation that the second coming is very near. \" . . . we who are alive, . . . shall not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven . . . and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together . . .\"\n \n Revelation 22:7, 12, 20 - Jesus says, \"Behold, I come quickly.\"\n \n Almost two thousand years have passed, all those who knew him are long dead, yet Jesus? promise of a quick return remains unfulfilled. I think it?s time to acknowledge that either the New Testament Gospels are fiction or that Jesus flat-out lied.\n \n \n I miss the point!\n\n Well, if it looks like an insertion, and smells like an insertion, and sounds like an insertion, than it probably is an insertion. If that sentence had been in the texts the others were copying from, why would they omit it? They wouldn't, and it wasn't. It was added later.\n \n \nWhy weren?t they organized?\n\n It diesn't say they were unorganized. It says they weren't organized to the level one could call a church.\n \n \n Why should he?????? How could this benefit the congregation?\n\n To inspire confidence in him?\n \n \n What you seem to suggest is that when people achieve something that no other human being can, then we should rub everyone else?s nose in it.\n\n I thought the point of all this writing was to spread the \"Good News\" about Christ. Why not talk about the wonderful things one experienced as his contemporaries- especially since we're all supposedly going to be meetimg up with him again next Tuesday.\n \n \n Quotes (WBTS)\n\n The oldest reference to Peter 1 and 2 are from Origen, in the 3rd century.\n \n Critical scolars recognize at least Peter 2 as pseudonymous for sure, Peter 1 is less certain. \n \n http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/2peter/intro.htm\n \nThe principal reasons for this view are the following. The author refers to the apostles and \"our ancestors\" as belonging to a previous generation, now dead (2 Peter 3:2-4 ). A collection of Paul's letters exists and appears to be well known, but disputes have arisen about the interpretation of them (2 Peter 3:14-16). The passage about false teachers (2 Peter 2:1-18) contains a number of literary contacts with Jude 1:4-16 , and it is generally agreed that 2 Peter depends upon Jude, not vice versa. Finally, the principal problem exercising the author is the false teaching of \"scoffers\" who have concluded from the delay of the parousia that the Lord is not going to return. This could scarcely have been an issue during the lifetime of Simon Peter.\n\n *********************\n \n \n I meant by compelling reason that if you look at what is written about Jesus and take away the supernatural stuff, there?s no compelling reason not to just believe he existed. Like some of the Greek gods.\n\n Even given that there were so many supposed Messiahs running around? Even given that there is nothing about the writings about his life that are unique or incongruous with earlier mythology to suggest they are biographical? There's neither a compelling reason to believe he did exist.\n \n \n Well Paul knew Peter and James and both of them were followers of Jesus. Unless you want to believe that they both set up this elaborate story to try and convince Paul and others that Jesus was a person when he really did not exist.\n\n Ok, I'm not saying that Paul wasn't referring to someone who may have existed. I'm saying that this is not the person the Gospels describe. For all I know, Paul could have been referring to Jesus ben Damneus, who was a High Priest at the time Jesus was suppoed to have existed, and did have a brother named James. I haven't researched this possibility, but why not?\n \n The question is, is there a single person whose life is described in the Gospels (minmus the supernatural stuff, which I guess leaves the parables), who was the same person Paul claims he saw in a vision?\n \n \nIt?s not that important to me. I just think that the context it is used in means a crucifixion.\n\n I disagree....\n ************************\n \n \n Jesus is mentioned in the writings of Josephus. While Josephus is noted as being extremely biased in his writings, he was not a christian and his historical detail is accurate. \n\n \n Have you read the Testamonium Flavianum? It calls Jesus \"the Christ\", and for that any many other reasons is clearly a forgery, inserted later, probably by Bishop Eusebius around the 4th century.\n \n \nThere are many documents written concerning the gospels within a decade or two of the death of Jesus. Some of Pauls writings were written in asia and show up in Africa less than 10 years later. There has been more archaeological, paleontological , historical study of the Bible than any other document, by far. There is more documentary evidence for the bible than for any other document (by far) that is generally considered authentic and accurate.\n\n Please share more information about this abundance of documentation. Which documents written in 10 CE? What \"documentary evidence\"? For all the archaeological, paleontological, and historical study of the Bible that has been, I haven't seen any convincing evidence to support Biblical myths.",

   "You are still talking about a fairly elaborate ruse and for what reason? \n\n For which writings do you mean? The Pauline writings were of a small Jewish Messianic cult, of which there were many at the time, and clearly describe a spiritual Messiah. Here I mean the five books which it seems were written by Paul, not the thirteen attributed to him. The \"Good News\" of Paul is the liberation of Jewish ppl from the original covenant, and the allowance for personal salvation in a soon-to-come new Jewish kingdom. The Gospels are later writings written for various reasons, Mark to give a setting and \"real-life\" story to the Gospel Q, Matthew to provide OT/Judaic Prophetic validation for Mark, Luke for the Gentiles/Pagans, John as a response to the Gnostics.\n \n \nI understand why people make up supernatural qualities for people they believe are their religious leaders. But why concoct a mother and father and brothers and genealogy and stories and parables and a detailed crucifixion about someone that didn?t exist? \n\n What you don't seem to be getting is that the Gospels were written long after Jesus's supposed life/death/resurrection, in the context of an already existing sect/cult/church of Christianity. The earliest NT writings, those of Paul, which according to logic should include the most info about the life/death/resurrection of Jesus, don't include any mention of a wandering teaching live human born of Mary the virgin and Joseph the carpenter, etc. They don't include any of Jesus' supposed teachings, which Paul was supposed to be spreading, but lots of theological ethics that Paul himself invented- useless if there existed information about what the Son of God actually said. Besides which, Paul life and location correspond and overlap with Jesus'- Paul is supposed to have lived between 6-67 CE, and describes himself as being implicated in the politics and law enforcement of the very area Jesus was in. Although he speaks frankly about having persecuted Christians, he doesn't mention any of the Gospel events which would for sure have failed to escape his attention- the miracles, sermons, Temple-cleansing, earthquake and sudden darkness.... in fact he does not in any way describe Jesus as a man who existed in his lifetime, and died in his neighborhood. Although he speaks often of Peter, it is not as a person who knew Jesus personally, denied him three times, etc. It simply makes no logical sense to believe that the Gospel accounts of Jesus are referring to any live person.\n \n \nWe have what amounts to \"orders of services\" from the church dating back to the early 300's and 400's.\n\n None earlier, of course. This period of time, from 150-400 CE, was one of rampant plagerization and forgery.\n \n \n As to Josephus - quite possible what you are describing was an insertion. However, he also provides enough detail to show that the jesus we are talking about existed, without saying he was the christ. \n\n It really doesn't seem to me that you've read the Testimonium Flavianum.\n \n This is a transcript, word for word, of a paragraph supposedly written by Josephus. Josephus, the Orthodox Jewish man, who wrote multiple chapters on individual petty theives, sums up conveniently in one paragraph everything in the Gospels. This paragraph is not mentioned by any Christian writers before the 4th century, despite them mentioning Josephus.\n \n \n\"Testimonium Flavianum\"\n Now, there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works,a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.\n\n ? Josephus (aka Joseph ben Matthias) The Antiquities of the Jews, Book 18, Chapter 3: the so called Testimonium Flavianum\n \n Note that he calls Jesus \"the Christ\", said his resurrection was \"fortold by the divine prophets\", and strangly ends with \"to this day\", which would make no sense whatsoever, as Josephus was writing at a time when contemporaries of the supposed Christ would still be alive.",

   "For which writings do you mean? The Pauline writings were of a small Jewish Messianic cult, of which there were many at the time, and clearly describe a spiritual Messiah. Here I mean the five books which it seems were written by Paul, not the thirteen attributed to him. The \"Good News\" of Paul is the liberation of Jewish ppl from the original covenant, and the allowance for personal salvation in a soon-to-come new Jewish kingdom. The Gospels are later writings written for various reasons, Mark to give a setting and \"real-life\" story to the Gospel Q, Matthew to provide OT/Judaic Prophetic validation for Mark, Luke for the Gentiles/Pagans, John as a response to the Gnostics.\n \n \n What you don't seem to be getting is that the Gospels were written long after Jesus's supposed life/death/resurrection, in the context of an already existing sect/cult/church of Christianity. The earliest NT writings, those of Paul, which according to logic should include the most info about the life/death/resurrection of Jesus, don't include any mention of a wandering teaching live human born of Mary the virgin and Joseph the carpenter, etc. They don't include any of Jesus' supposed teachings, which Paul was supposed to be spreading, but lots of theological ethics that Paul himself invented- useless if there existed information about what the Son of God actually said. Besides which, Paul life and location correspond and overlap with Jesus'- Paul is supposed to have lived between 6-67 CE, and describes himself as being implicated in the politics and law enforcement of the very area Jesus was in.

Believe me, I've done the research. I have no vested interest either way in whether Isreal were enslaved by Egypt, or whether there existed a Jesus of Nazareth (or a Nazareth for that matter). I was perfectly happy believing that Jesus was a historical mythologized figure, and was surprised at the mountain of evidence that it is the opposite- Jesus is a myth that was made into a man. Not mythologized history, but historicized mythology.",

They were arguing about who was a hypocrite, so it's a bit of a glaring omission that Paul would be kind enough not to mention that Paul had denied the Christ!\n\n No! I said scriptural reason why he should have mentioned it; your opinion on the matter doesn't really carry much weight. Here are a few reasons why, using my Bible he SHOULDN'T have mentioned it:\n \n Ezekiel 33:14-16\n 14 \"'And when I say to the wicked one: \"You will positively die,\" and he actually turns back from his sin and carries on justice and righteousness, 15 [and] the wicked one returns the very thing pledged, pays back the very things taken by robbery, [and] actually walks in the very statutes of life by not doing injustice, he will positively keep living. He will not die. 16 None of his sins with which he has sinned will be remembered against him. Justice and righteousness are what he has carried on. He will positively keep living.'\n Luke 17:3-4\n 3 Pay attention to yourselves. If your brother commits a sin give him a rebuke, and if he repents forgive him. 4 Even if he sins seven times a day against you and he comes back to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him.\"\n \n \nSo the Gospels are \"gossip\" now? In any case, if Paul was trying to keep from destroying Peter's reputation, he should then have defended those actions rather than been silent about them, as the other believers would otherwise do the math themselves. Unless, of course, it didn't happen.\n\n Peter's actions were a fulfilment of prophecy, worthy of a mention I think.\n \nIt's a pretty important thing to omit. Especially as the Gospels were not written to be read together, but seperately, such that leaving it out means that lots of people would not know that Peter was supposed to be the Church's foundation.\n\n Not really! The Bible was always meant as a whole book. If we follow your logic all the gospels should be identical and would be a pretty boring read.\n \nWhen there's a little number in superscript at the end of a sentence, it's usually a footnote reference. As here, where it references this page-\n http://home.inu.net/skeptic/lie.html \n The following quotes confirm that Jesus deliberately lead his followers into false expectations.\n Okay. I think the problem here is the same old problem of reading the Bible as it's written, and not looking any deeper into what is really meant. Lets take them one at a time:\n \n \nMatthew 10:23 - When giving instructions to his apostles as to just how they are to go about spreading his message Jesus says,.\" . . . for truly I say unto you, you shall not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.\"\n\n I think your missing the point! Who was Jesus really speaking to, was his message just meant for those who were listening there? or would it be written down and relayed to all his followers? It is true! the global witnessing campaign by JW's will not end until the tribulation.\n \n \nMatthew 16:28 - Jesus says to his disciples, \"There are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\"\n\n In a matter of days, those words of Jesus were fulfilled. Taking with him the apostles Peter, James and John, God's Son climbed a high mountain, presumably Hermon. On a spur of this mountain, the following took place: \"[Jesus] was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his outer garments became brilliant as the light.\" Thus the three apostles had confirmed to them that Jesus' coming in Kingdom power would indeed be glorious.\n \nMatthew 24:33-34 - After prophesying a wide assortment of events including the second coming, Jesus said to his disciples, \" . . . when you shall see all these things, know that it (the 2nd coming) is near, even at the door. This generation shall not pass till these things be fulfilled.\" He was obviously referring to the contemporary generation.\n\n Lets look at the context of the entire prophecy. Matt. 24:1,2 Jesus says that the buildings they saw around them were to be demolished. Correct? In response the disciples ask him a three part question at Matt. 24:3 \"Tell us, (1) When will these things be, (2) and what will be the sign of your presence (3) and of the conclusion of the system of things?\" The disciples here evidently thought that the three were all connected, so Jesus gave them a three-part answer. \n The generation you are referring to is us, lets see why! At matt. 24:4 And in answer Jesus said to them: \"Look out that nobody misleads YOU; 5 for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many.\"\n There are more 'Christian' religions on the earth today than ever before!\n 6 YOU are going to hear of wars and reports of wars; see that YOU are not terrified. For these things must take place, but the end is not yet.\n We live in the most war-torn generation ever to exist. Not only that but we are capable of complete annihilation, so lets not be terrified. \n \n 7 \"For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. 8 All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress. \n Global warfare! In 1914 came the fulfilment of this prophecy. Nowhere else in mankind's history can this very important prophecy be pinned, it is our generation that it belongs to. So the generation that witnesses the fulfilment of this will see \"all things taking place\" in the prophecy given by Jesus including the great tribulation and Armageddon. That generation is now 90 years old not nearly 2000. Do you notice in the world some very big changes since the First World War? I do! Compare it with 2Tim 3:1-5.\n \nMatthew 26:64 - When brought before Caiaphas, the Chief Priest, Jesus said to him, \"I tell you, hereafter you shall see the Son of Man . . . coming on the clouds of heaven.\" According to this the second coming was to happen during Caiaphas' lifetime.\n\n No! He was simply referring to mankind in general. Why? Because he applied Daniels prophecy to himself found at Dan: 7:13.\n \n \nMark 9:1 - Jesus said to the people and to his disciples, ?Verily I say unto you, that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.\n Again the transfiguration. \n \n \nLuke 21:27-28 -Jesus said to the congregation, ?And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.?\n \n Exactly! The congregation his followers. Including the ones on earth today.\n \n \nLuke 21:32 - Jesus said, again to the congregation, ?This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.?\n\n \n You and me! \n \n \nI Thessalonians 4:15-17 - In his first Epistle to the Thessalonians Paul assures the congregation that the second coming is very near. \" . . . we who are alive, . . . shall not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven . . . and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together . . .\"\n\n Again the 'we' he refers to is not limited to the people present with him at the time but can be expanded to fit all the followers of Christ, which at the fulfilment of this evidently didn't include him (sort of). However this is a huge verse that really needs a huge explanation, which I can do if you so wish.\n \nRevelation 22:7, 12, 20 - Jesus says, \"Behold, I come quickly.\"\n\n Did you know that a thousand years are like a day to Jehovah? Which would then make this very quick (2 days).\n \n \nAlmost two thousand years have passed, all those who knew him are long dead,\n Some are, and some are not!!!\n yet Jesus? promise of a quick return remains unfulfilled.\n No he's already returned, although not physically as some might suggest he would.\n \nI think it?s time to acknowledge that either the New Testament Gospels are fiction or that Jesus flat-out lied.\n \n I have no reason to think this. The Bible answers all questions to mankind's problems. As I seen you admit it is absolutely jam-packed with wisdom, but it doesn't stop there!\n \n\n Well, if it looks like an insertion, and smells like an insertion, and sounds like an insertion, than it probably is an insertion. If that sentence had been in the texts the others were copying from, why would they omit it? They wouldn't, and it wasn't. It was added later.\n\n As I've said the gospels don't need to be identical to be true.\n \nIt diesn't say they were unorganized. It says they weren't organized to the level one could call a church.\n\n This would probably be because they were only a small group at the time, not a Global church. Is this the point that you're trying to make or have I missed it?\n \n \nI thought the point of all this writing was to spread the \"Good News\" about Christ. Why not talk about the wonderful things one experienced as his contemporaries- especially since we're all supposedly going to be meetimg up with him again next Tuesday.\n\n In the climate that the two letters of Peter were written it would not have needed to mention old stuff that they already were quite aware of. There were far more important things that were in need of address, like a very damaging rise in apostasy, the same apostasy that eventually decimated the 1st century Christian religion. If you look sincerely at all the 'Christian' religions since then they are all so way off from what the Bible teaches it's untrue. \n \n \nCritical scolars recognize at least Peter 2 as pseudonymous for sure, Peter 1 is less certain. \n \n I agree. There is more reason to believe that 2Peter is 'more suspect', but still no solid ground. (see end)\n \n \nhttp://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/2peter/intro.htm \n The principal reasons for this view are the following. The author refers to the apostles and \"our ancestors\" as belonging to a previous generation, now dead (2 Peter 3:2-4 ). \n \n No! A false claim, look closely at the verses 2 Peter 3:2-4;\n \n 2 that YOU should remember the sayings previously spoken by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour through YOUR apostles. \n \n So already there's a separating of two peoples, holy prophets and apostles.\n \n 3 For YOU know this first, that in the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires 4 and saying: \"Where is this promised presence of his?\n \n Not in their time clearly.\n \n Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep [in death], all things are continuing exactly as from creation's beginning.\"\n \n I think this is the point that your website is referring to, but the 'forefathers' mentioned here in context aren't the apostles but are the 'holy prophets' the servants of God that had indeed passed away.\n \n \nA collection of Paul's letters exists and appears to be well known, but disputes have arisen about the interpretation of them (2 Peter 3:14-16).\n\n \n You're telling me! How many interpretations of scripture do you think there is, but how many are testable to the full?\n \n \nThe passage about false teachers (2 Peter 2:1-18) contains a number of literary contacts with Jude 1:4-16 , and it is generally agreed that 2 Peter depends upon Jude, not vice versa. \n \n \n Firstly no books in the Bible 'depend' on each other in that sense, they all have their own angle and approach to problems faced by people at the time they are written. \n Jude and the two books of peter were evidently written around the same time they all have the intent of protecting the congregation from the incoming foretold apostasy found at 1 Tim. 4:1: \"The inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons.\" And 2 Thess. 2:3: \"Let no one seduce you in any manner, because [the day of Jehovah] will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness gets revealed, the son of destruction.\" Again this fact rules out a much latter writing. \n \n \n \nFinally, the principal problem exercising the author is the false teaching of \"scoffers\" who have concluded from the delay of the parousia that the Lord is not going to return. This could scarcely have been an issue during the lifetime of Simon Peter.\n\n After reading the prophecies it would seem this WAS a very big problem in his lifetime. The foretold apostasy was evident as we see when you cross it with the writings of Jude. Also the fact must be mentioned that the disciples of Jesus' time thought that they were going to see the promised intervention by God, and if THEY thought they were going to see it then surely the ones that came after had even more reason to think this. Correct? That's why the teaching regarding 'scoffers' came about! It's not false but very true and apt.\n Following Quote from \"all scripture is inspired of God and beneficial\" published by (WBTS) \n 6 Determining Canonicity. What are some of the divine indications that have determined the canonicity of the 66 books of the Bible? First of all, the documents must deal with Jehovah's affairs in the earth, turning men to his worship and stimulating deep respect for his name and for his work and purposes in the earth. They must give evidence of inspiration, that is, that they are products of holy spirit. (2 Pet. 1:21) There must be no appeal to superstition or creature worship but, rather, an appeal to love and service of God. There would have to be nothing in any of the individual writings that would conflict with the internal harmony of the whole, but, rather, each book must, by its unity with the others, support the one authorship, that of Jehovah God. We would also expect the writings to give evidence of accuracy down to the smallest details. In addition to these basic essentials, there are other specific indications of inspiration, and therefore of canonicity, according to the nature of each book's contents, and these have been discussed herein in the introductory material to each of the Bible books. Also, there are special circumstances that apply to the Hebrew Scriptures and others to the Christian Greek Scriptures that help in establishing the Bible canon.\n The books of 1st and 2nd peter are testable to the full and are found sound.\n Richard,\n p.s. these are very brief explanations into some verses but if you want a more full explanation then lets take one or two at a time,",

   " The above list is the evidence that the book was widely accepted, although it would seem the reluctance by some was mainly on the grounds that it was not very well circulated at the time. \n\n Forgeries were much more difficult to catch in the 2nd - 4th centuries than they are now. They were also rampant.\n \n Note that the first we hear of these supposed writings of Peter are in 170 CE- which is at least a hundred years after Paul's time, and he was a contemporary of Peter's. Where was it before that? \n \n \n No! I said scriptural reason why he should have mentioned it;\n\n If characters in the Bible only did what was scriptural, it would be a much much shorter book. Inconsistencies of behavior are par for the course. \n \n \nLuke 17:3-4\n 3 Pay attention to yourselves. If your brother commits a sin give him a rebuke, and if he repents forgive him. 4 Even if he sins seven times a day against you and he comes back to you seven times, saying, ?I repent,? you must forgive him.?\n\n Funny you should mention this re: Peter's denial of Christ. Why was it that Peter, who denied Christ three times, was forgiven without even having had to ask forgiveness in the Gospels? He swore an oath against Jesus, but goes on to found the Church. At the same time Judas, who at most pointed out Jesus (though not even, because Jesus says the men should recognize him from the Temple), dies of a horrible fate (or at least one of the horrible fates he is supposed to have because there are a few options mentioned)- even though Judas begs forgiveness in Matthew 27:3-5? Even though Judas never committed apostasy?\n \n \n Peter?s actions were a fulfilment of prophecy, worthy of a mention I think.\n\n So were Judas'. If Peter's actions were worthy of mention, why weren't they mentioned by Paul?\n \n \n Not really! The Bible was always meant as a whole book. If we follow your logic all the gospels should be identical and would be a pretty boring read.\n\n Firt of all, based on what do you think the Bible was meant to be a whole book? Second, the Gospels are virtually identical, esp the Synopt\n ics.\n \n \nI think your missing the point! Who was Jesus really speaking to, was his message just meant for those who were listening there?\n\n So your argument is that while Jesus was hanging with his apostles he made sure to say things that he knew would be quoted verbatim several generations later when his words were finally written down? He didn't feel bad about totally misleading his apostles, who would obviously assume that as he's talking to them, he means them? If one were to suspend logic completely and believe that Jesus existed and his words survived being passed around for decades after his death to be written down for all of us to read?\n \n \no the generation that witnesses the fulfilment of this will see ?all things taking place? in the prophecy given by Jesus including the great tribulation and Armageddon. \n\n People could say that for any given era. And they have. And still, no sign of Jesus. When will you give up and admit the prophesies aren't being fulfilled?\n \n \nAgain the transfiguration.\n\n They saw the Kingdom of God \"coming to power\" during the transfiguration? They saw the New Jerusalem on Earth and all that? That's a real stretch of the imagination.\n \n \nExactly! The congregation his followers. \n\n Again, it seems odd that Jesus would say this to a group of ppl and mislead them like that. Why didn't he specify, \"and this I mean for all my followers of the future who will read my words\" or something like that? Especially since he specifies \"armies around Judea\" and people of Jerusalem, etc. It goes against all logic to believe that he wasn't talking to the ppl he was talking to.\n \n \nYou and me!\n\n So for all the generations before us who have read that, he was just kidding?\n \n \n Did you know that a thousand years are like a day to Jehovah? Which would then make this very quick (2 days).\n\n So, even though God is able to talk about the future on a human scale all the time elsewhere (telling ppl they're going to have babies, for example), all of a sudden when it comes to the most important thing in the world, he forgets and uses his own clock?\n \n Furthermore, isn't the world only a few thousand years old? Say you believe the world is 7000-8000 years old, and this was 2000 years ago, so the world had been around for 5000-6000 years. He's going around telling ppl the Kingdom is \"at hand\", when it's going to be another some half the amount of time the world has been in existence until these things will happen?\n \n \n As I?ve said the gospels don?t need to be identical to be true.\n\n So they can blatantly contradict each other, but still each be true? Is this a parallel universe phenomenon? \n \n \n This would probably be because they were only a small group at the time, not a Global church. Is this the point that you?re trying to make or have I missed it?\n\n Yes, that's my point. The time of authorship can be determined by what the author says- in this case the description \"church\" suggests a later date.\n \n \n In the climate that the two letters of Peter were written it would not have needed to mention old stuff that they already were quite aware of.\n\n Even when he was addressing ppl living far from Judea? It was necessary to counsel them with Paul's own theological thoughts, but not back them up with quotes from Jesus? He even says things like not knowing how to pray, as though he hasn't heard of the \"Our Father\", etc. If he knew the stories of the Gospels, why was he being so tight-lipped about them? Why do the ppl who supposedly lived at the same time as Jesus say less about his life than those who lived decades later? Wouldn't the opposite make more sense?\n \n \n No! A false claim, look closely at the verses 2 Peter 3:2-4;\n\n What version of the Bible do you have?\n \n \nAgain this fact rules out a much latter writing. (...)\n After reading the prophecies it would seem this WAS a very big problem in his lifetime. \n \n\n Circular logic.",

   "\n Firt of all, based on what do you think the Bible was meant to be a whole book? Second, the Gospels are virtually identical, esp the Synopt\n ics.\n \n \n\n \n Not really addressing your arguments directly just this one section. \n \n Certainly there is a lot of similarity in the synoptics and the Gospels in general. That would be expected when writing about the same person. There are significant differences. Matthew and Mark are very similar. Luke is quite different and John even more so. This only lends credence to their separate writing and their authenticity. It is exactly what one would expect of something written by different people about the same person. \n \n Likewise, if we were going to create something, humans that is, why would we make it about anything but us. Control, by its nature must be about the person being good enough. That is not the focus of the bible. The apostles are painted in an often foolish and silly light. Hardly the kind of thing that the church would do to prove its worth. I would think the church would try to paint the apostles in the best light. All of them running away at the crucifixion, John doing so in such a hurry he leaves his clothing behind and runs away naked. Or when Peter says that Jesus is the Christ and Jesus tells him that He will build his church on this faith and tells them all that he must die. Peter then turns around ans says that it would never be. Jesus says to him Get behind me satan. If I were going to write a work of fiction used to control others, I don't think I would include things like that. \n \n I certainly wouldn't have painted David in the light he is painted in the bible. A man after God's own heart, yes. However, he was a polygamist, a murderer, an adulterer, and very prideful. I would have left those parts out. \n \n What you are saying just doesn't make sense. The fact that the hard to explain parts are in the bible lends credence to it. Not detracts.",

   "Mizmaxx\n \nForgeries were much more difficult to catch in the 2nd - 4th centuries than they are now. \n \n Why? Your explanation should be interesting.\n \n \nNote that the first we hear of these supposed writings of Peter are in 170 CE- which is at least a hundred years after Paul's time, and he was a contemporary of Peter's. Where was it before that?\n \n It was a list of biblical compilers, not the people who believed the writings. The Bible was not put together as one book until later. You know that much I'm sure.\n \nIf characters in the Bible only did what was scriptural, it would be a much much shorter book. Inconsistencies of behavior are par for the course.\n \n So what you're saying is that you want more arguments and more upset from the Bible for it to be true? I disagree!\n \nFunny you should mention this re: Peter's denial of Christ. Why was it that Peter, who denied Christ three times, was forgiven without even having had to ask forgiveness in the Gospels? \n \n He didn't have to ask the Gospels for forgiveness; he had to ask God, which he evidently DID other wise he wouldn't carry on in the service. Just because it's not mentioned doesn't mean it didn't happen \n \nHe sinned seriously by repeatedly denying Jesus. Why did God forgive Peter? Unlike Judas Iscariot, Peter had been honest in the service of God and Christ.\n This apostle's sin was due to fleshly weakness, and he was truly repentant and \"wept bitterly.\"-Matthew 26:69-75.\n True repentance is vital if an erring Christian is to be forgiven by God. To repent means \"to turn from sin out of penitence for past wrongdoings\" or \"feel regret or contrition for what one has done or omitted to do.\" A truly repentant person would show remorse over any reproach, sorrow, or problems his sin had brought on Jehovah's name and organization. The repentant wrongdoer would also produce corresponding fruit, performing works that befit repentance. (Matthew 3:8; Acts 26:20) For example, if he had defrauded someone, he would take reasonable steps to compensate for the loss. (Luke 19:8) Such a repentant Christian has sound Scriptural reasons to be confident that Jehovah will forgive in a large way.\n Some of the above is pasted from my Watchtower library. Watchtower mag. 9/15, 1992.\n \nHe swore an oath against Jesus, but goes on to found the Church. At the same time Judas, who at most pointed out Jesus (though not even, because Jesus says the men should recognize him from the Temple), \n Following Quoted from 'Insight on the scriptures' Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. (WBTS) \n \n Some translations use \"cornerstone(s)\" to render a Hebrew word (pin\u00b7nah'), which carries the basic thought of \"corner\" but is also used metaphorically for a chief as a 'corner' of defense or support, hence for a keyman. Thus, at Isaiah 19:13 certain translations use \"cornerstone(s)\" (RS; AT; AS), whereas others use \"chiefs\" (Le) and \"leaders\" (Mo), agreeing basically with the New World Translation rendering \"keymen.\" (See also Jg 20:2; 1Sa 14:38; Zec 10:4, where the Hebrew is literally \"the corner tower(s),\" these being pictorial of important or vital men, or chiefs.) Such an application of 'corner' to a keyman seems significant in view of the symbolic application of \"cornerstone\" in Messianic prophecy.\n Jesus Christ is Scripturally spoken of as the \"foundation cornerstone\" of the Christian congregation, which is likened to a spiritual house. Through Isaiah, Jehovah foretold that He would lay in Zion as a foundation \"a stone, a tried stone, the precious corner of a sure foundation.\" (Isa 28:16) Peter quoted and applied to Jesus Christ this prophecy regarding the \"foundation cornerstone\" on which individual anointed Christians are built up as \"living stones,\" to become a spiritual house or temple for Jehovah. (1Pe 2:4-6) Similarly, Paul showed that members of the Christian congregation had been built up \"upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.\n Psalm 118:22 discloses that the stone rejected by the builders would become \"the head of the corner\" (Heb., ro'sh pin\u00b7nah'). Jesus quoted and applied this prophecy to himself as \"the chief cornerstone\" (Gr., ke\u00b7pha\u00b7le' go\u00b7ni'as, head of the corner). (Mt 21:42; Mr 12:10, 11; Lu 20:17) Just as the topmost stone of a building is conspicuous, so Jesus Christ is the crowning stone of the Christian congregation of anointed ones, which is likened to a spiritual temple. Peter also applied Psalm 118:22 to Christ, showing that he was \"the stone\" rejected by men but chosen by God to become \"the head of the corner.\"-Ac 4:8-12; see also 1Pe 2:4-7.\n So no! Peter is not the foundation of my church! Only Christ.\n \ndies of a horrible fate (or at least one of the horrible fates he is supposed to have because there are a few options mentioned)- even though Judas begs forgiveness in Matthew 27:3-5? Even though Judas never committed apostasy?\n\n Which horrible fate are you referring to? One account is simplified the other goes into more detail.\n \nSo were Judas'. If Peter's actions were worthy of mention, why weren't they mentioned by Paul?\n\n TUT! They already had been mentioned. If you have a disagreement with one of your friends in public, would you appreciate them dragging up the past which you so much regretted?\n \n \nFirt of all, based on what do you think the Bible was meant to be a whole book? \n \n \n What we really need for true worship is already included in God's Word. As Paul wrote to Timothy: \"From infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.\" (2 Timothy 3:15-17) \n \nSecond, the Gospels are virtually identical, esp the Synopt\n ics.\n\n The most important human being to walk the face of the earth is Jesus Christ, the redeemer who was promised to free mankind from the enslavement of sin. It would seem fair then to mention him more than once! Don't you think? \n \nSo your argument is that while Jesus was hanging with his apostles he made sure to say things that he knew would be quoted verbatim several generations later when his words were finally written down?\n Yep! The same as when George Bush speaks to the American people, they don't all need to be in front of him or listening at that exact time. Do they? It's relayed via various means, bit like this account.\n \nHe didn't feel bad about totally misleading his apostles, who would obviously assume that as he's talking to them, he means them?\n\n \n No! He didn't mislead them, the answers were always there, all they had to do was look hard enough and they would find them. Jesus met with them just before he ascended to heaven. The account says: \"When, now, they had assembled, they went asking him: 'Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?'\" Like Jesus, they yearned for the Kingdom to come. Yet, Jesus replied: \"It does not belong to you to get knowledge of the times or seasons which the Father has placed in his own jurisdiction; but you will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon you, and you will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth.\"-Acts 1:6-8.\n There is no indication that the disciples were disheartened by this reply. Instead, they zealously busied themselves with the work of preaching. Within weeks, they had filled Jerusalem with their teaching. (Acts 5:28) And within 30 years, they had expanded their preaching activity to such an extent that Paul could say that the good news was preached \"in all creation that is under heaven.\" (Colossians 1:23) Although the Kingdom was not 'restored to Israel' as the disciples had wrongly expected and it was not established in heaven during their lifetime, they kept on serving Jehovah zealously with eternity in view.\n Two things can be deduced from the way Jesus answered questions relating to when things would occur in fulfillment of God's purpose. First, that Jehovah has a timetable; and second, that he alone fixes it, and his servants cannot expect to be given precise advance information of his times or seasons.\n So there was no misleading! The problem rested with the disciples of that time.\n \n \nIf one were to suspend logic completely and believe that Jesus existed and his words survived being passed around for decades after his death to be written down for all of us to read?\n How is it logical to believe that he didn't exist? \n \nPeople could say that for any given era. And they have. And still, no sign of Jesus. When will you give up and admit the prophesies aren't being fulfilled?\n\n A VERY common response! But can you show me the 'era' you speak of? I mean which generation do you want to pin this prophecy to?\n \nThey saw the Kingdom of God \"coming to power\" during the transfiguration? They saw the New Jerusalem on Earth and all that? \n \n The New Jerusalem, together with Christ on his throne is the symbolic city of Jerusalem, it constitutes the \"new heavens\" that rule over the \"new earth,\" which is human society on earth. Yet to come.\n \nThat's a real stretch of the imagination.\n\n I know! I'll slow down, sorry!\n \nAgain, it seems odd that Jesus would say this to a group of ppl and mislead them like that. Why didn't he specify, \"and this I mean for all my followers of the future who will read my words\" or something like that?\n\n He did when he said things like \"all\" and \"you people\" or \"Richard\" LOL.\n \nEspecially since he specifies \"armies around Judea\" and people of Jerusalem, etc. It goes against all logic to believe that he wasn't talking to the ppl he was talking to.\n\n As I've said the disciples asked him a three part question which they thought were all the same thing, but it wasn't. destruction of Jerusalem came in their generation, and for the most part the rest of the prophecy comes in our life-time.\n \nSo for all the generations before us who have read that, he was just kidding?\n\n All the generations before us didn't experience Global warfare, wars unprecedented, massive religious confusion and 2Tim. 3:1-5. All at the same time. Did they? Did they? Did they???\n \nSo, even though God is able to talk about the future on a human scale all the time elsewhere (telling ppl they're going to have babies, for example), all of a sudden when it comes to the most important thing in the world, he forgets and uses his own clock?\n If he clearly explains to someone what the time is, and they don't listen, then who is to blame? Not him.\n \n \nFurthermore, isn't the world only a few thousand years old? Say you believe the world is 7000-8000 years old, and this was 2000 years ago, so the world had been around for 5000-6000 years. He's going around telling ppl the Kingdom is \"at hand\", when it's going to be another some half the amount of time the world has been in existence until these things will happen?\n\n I've never said any of that!!! 'Straw man'\n \nSo they can blatantly contradict each other, but still each be true? Is this a parallel universe phenomenon? \n \n Where? You must be mistaken! I've never seen any contradictions between Gospels.\n \nYes, that's my point. The time of authorship can be determined by what the author says- in this case the description \"church\" suggests a later date.\n\n I think you need to check exactly what the word 'Church' means.\n \nEven when he was addressing ppl living far from Judea? It was necessary to counsel them with Paul's own theological thoughts, but not back them up with quotes from Jesus? He even says things like not knowing how to pray, as though he hasn't heard of the \"Our Father\", etc. If he knew the stories of the Gospels, why was he being so tight-lipped about them?\n Very very weak!!!\n \nWhy do the ppl who supposedly lived at the same time as Jesus say less about his life than those who lived decades later? Wouldn't the opposite make more sense?\n\n Your not making sense! Please expand what you mean I'm lost!\n \nWhat version of the Bible do you have?\n\n What you mean is that you're whole assault on the books of 1st and 2nd Peter has failed.\n \nCircular logic.\n\n Explain! Sounds very straight to me.",

   "Yes, and I know, that for you, the teachings of Jesus are the teachings that you pick to be the teachings of Jesus. You don't need Peter or Paul or the Church because you have set yourself up as sole arbiter of the truth.\n\n \n I&#8217;m not the arbiter of truth, Jesus points to the Holy Spirit which is the arbiter of the truth. You let the church pick what you believe.\n \n \n Jesus doesn't need the Church nor does God. They chose the Church as the most efficacious means to their end.\n\n \n According to the church they did. That&#8217;s very convenient for the church.\n \n \nThey are in accord with the teachings concerning the Holy Spirit but not in accord with his other teachings. It should not be \"either/or\" but rather \"both/and.\" It should be a comprehensive belief not a one sided belief.\n\n \n If they are in accord with the teachings of the Holy Spirit as you say, I wouldn&#8217;t take a chance on mankind messing it up with their interpretation.\n \n \n \nJesus also told the apostles to go to peoples homes and ask their hospitality. He did not tell the apostles to make those people sell all of their belongings. Some material things are required and some people are required to keep those material things to utilize them for the Kingdom.\n\n \n Jesus didn&#8217;t tell anyone to MAKE anyone do anything. It&#8217;s a choice, although a difficult one. He did so himself and he taught that your should give up your worldly possessions if you are to be perfect in the will of God. So I don&#8217;t know what material things you are talking about. Unless Jesus didn&#8217;t know what he was talking about. Even if you twist the words to mean he said you could keep some things, that&#8217;s a long way from the wealth of what the church has today. \n \n \n Or maybe it matters what is in your heart when you give.\n\n \n Absolutely, which is why the widow gave all she had and depended on God for her support. And why Jesus said you should give all. It&#8217;s a sign of your heart.\n \n \nThis is an issue that we cannot debate much further as we would get into the necessity of the sacraments that the Church administers that I know you do not believe in. But I still insist that a Church is required because it is evident that Jesus believed in a community of belief and you need to have a relationship with others to have a relationship with God--the most appropriate place--church.\n\n \n You can insist all you want to. But you, and no one else except the Holy Spirit, can decide what I need for a relationship with God.\n \n \nBut wouldn't it be great to pray with someone you love?\n\n \n If I am communicating with God, why would I want a third party involved? Is that the way you communicate with your loved ones when you really want a special time with them?\n \n \n I meant most Christians.\n\n \n Yep, but quantity does not make right.\n \n \nBut you think the Church became a Pauline church and not a Jesus church. Was the Spirit lying to Paul?\n\n \n The Holy Spirit does not lie. In my opinion Paul was a good man and very sincere in what he believed. But he was not near the man Jesus was nor did he have as close a relationship with God as Jesus did. That is evident by the fact that he taught very little of what Jesus taught. So although I&#8217;m sure Paul thought he was preaching what God wanted, it&#8217;s not what was revealed to Jesus and the other great men of God. So I&#8217;ll stick with what Jesus taught and you can stick with what the church and Paul teaches.\n \n \nMen do not compare with God...UNTIL...God puts himself on earth as a man...a full man/full God...Jesus.\n\n \n That&#8217;s just a belief of yours that the church tells you to believe. \n \n \n Then we must respect God's decision to communicate with us by using our own nature that he created.\n\n \n That&#8217;s just a belief of yours that the church tells you to believe. \n \n \nWe do not put aside God to listen to men. We listen to God through men--as Paul said, God making his appeal through us. Paul does not claim to be God or to put God aside. Paul humbles himself and acknowledges himself as a tool of God.\n\n \n And I keep saying, why would I listen to a man like Paul when I have Jesus and the Holy Spirit to listen to. That&#8217;s like saying I want to be taught chess by the guy that&#8217;s ranked 100 instead of the guy that&#8217;s ranked first when both are available.\n \n \nWhy not? The Spirit guided Paul.\n\n \n How do you know that, because your church said so?\n \n \nBut the thing is that the issue does not rest on that one verse. There is a mountain of other evidence that supports Peter's primacy.\n\n \n Not according to the Protestants.\n \n \nMost people might. But I look at it with confidence. If there was a real push to establish a church after the fact it would be all over the gospels in a very overt and ostentatious way. It would not be in the subtlety of two not so subtle verses. It is because of the casual but direct mention of the church that we can be assured that it was not contrived.\n\n \n And you say I pick what I want to. You would think it would at least have been mentioned one time in each of the gospels.\n \n \nActually I totally missed it. Please explain.\n\n \n I don&#8217;t know how you missed it. You were using Jesus praying in the garden as an example of Jesus praying in public when the disciples were asleep while he was praying. That is what I was pointing out as ludicrous that you changed to mean I was saying calling Jesus a liar was ludicrous which you knew I would not say from the beginning.\n \n \nI have it the way Jesus had it.\n \n Luke 10:16 \"He who hears you hears me, and he who rejects you rejects me, and he who rejects him who sent me.\"\n \n Matthew 28:18-20 \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe ALL that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.\"\n\n \n Well he was talking to his disciples who were his followers. You don&#8217;t need a church to be a disciple of Jesus. And what you call the church today doesn&#8217;t teach anyone to observe all the things Jesus commanded.\n \n \n(Also, keep in mind that when Jesus said he would send the Holy Spirit that he was talking to the apostles. He was talking to his Church.) \n\n \n You are totally wrong. First he was talking to his disciples and second he said that every one that asked, he would send the Holy Spirit.\n \n Maximus the church has done lots of good things and I respect the good people that are in the church. But there also have been leaders in the church that have done and promoted evil things. They have persecuted the Jews, they have persecuted those that don&#8217;t believe as they do, they have persecuted scientist, they have approved of slavery, they have been silent during WWII and others, they have oppressed women, and they have covered up sins, including the harming of children which is one of the worst of all evils, to protect themselves. You can say that&#8217;s not the church but the people in the church, but it&#8217;s the leaders in the church that make the decisions and guide the church and those members of the church. Now you want to tell me that I should be depending on people that have committed these kinds of evils to guide me in my spiritual thinking? Not on your life would I ever do that.",

   "For which writings do you mean? The Pauline writings were of a small Jewish Messianic cult, of which there were many at the time, and clearly describe a spiritual Messiah. Here I mean the five books which it seems were written by Paul, not the thirteen attributed to him. The \"Good News\" of Paul is the liberation of Jewish ppl from the original covenant, and the allowance for personal salvation in a soon-to-come new Jewish kingdom. The Gospels are later writings written for various reasons, Mark to give a setting and \"real-life\" story to the Gospel Q, Matthew to provide OT/Judaic Prophetic validation for Mark, Luke for the Gentiles/Pagans, John as a response to the Gnostics.\n \n What you don't seem to be getting is that the Gospels were written long after Jesus's supposed life/death/resurrection, in the context of an already existing sect/cult/church of Christianity. The earliest NT writings, those of Paul, which according to logic should include the most info about the life/death/resurrection of Jesus, don't include any mention of a wandering teaching live human born of Mary the virgin and Joseph the carpenter, etc. They don't include any of Jesus' supposed teachings, which Paul was supposed to be spreading, but lots of theological ethics that Paul himself invented- useless if there existed information about what the Son of God actually said. Besides which, Paul life and location correspond and overlap with Jesus'- Paul is supposed to have lived between 6-67 CE, and describes himself as being implicated in the politics and law enforcement of the very area Jesus was in. Although he speaks frankly about having persecuted Christians, he doesn't mention any of the Gospel events which would for sure have failed to escape his attention- the miracles, sermons, Temple-cleansing, earthquake and sudden darkness.... in fact he does not in any way describe Jesus as a man who existed in his lifetime, and died in his neighborhood. Although he speaks often of Peter, it is not as a person who knew Jesus personally, denied him three times, etc. It simply makes no logical sense to believe that the Gospel accounts of Jesus are referring to any live person.\n\n \n But what you don&#8217;t seem to be getting is that Paul was a contemporary of Jesus. Now maybe he never saw Jesus, but he wrote about himself not long after the death of Jesus stating that he persecuted the followers of Jesus. That would mean the followers of Jesus were following someone that never existed even though they were contemporaries of Jesus. That seems a stretch to believe that people would be so gullible to believe someone lived that never even existed just a few years before. In addition Paul talks about meeting with, staying with, and debating theology with Peter, John, and James, the brother of Jesus. All of this went on soon after the death of Jesus as James was still alive when Paul was writing.\n \n You can debate the theology of Paul and even his mental capacity. But I don&#8217;t know of anyone who questions his sincerity or his honesty. So I don&#8217;t think he just made up all these stories about meeting with the followers of Jesus.",

It is also thought that Mark was the secretary of Peter. There are a lot of connections.\n \n \nHave you read the Testamonium Flavianum? It calls Jesus \"the Christ\", and for that any many other reasons is clearly a forgery, inserted later, probably by Bishop Eusebius around the 4th century.\n\n Actually, it is believed by a lot of scholars that part of Josephus' statements were a forgery but were authentic.\n \n \"About this time there lived Jesus a wise man.\" This is accepted as authentic because it is in keeping with Josephus' style, vocabulary and the type of presentation in the rest of the work. When we get to the part that says, \"if indeed one ought to call him a man.\" (as well as other parts), this is seen as a Christian addition. Jesus is confirmed by Josephus in many scholars' eyes even though the passage as a whole is not considered authentic.\n \n \nNowhere does Paul, in all his letters to the Christians, mention or refer to any of the teachings or parables of the Gospels. Although the Gospels seem to evidence Christ's divinity through numerous \"miracles\", Paul speaks only of the resurrection and the \"gifts\" of faith. Paul speaks of Jesus' murderer naming Satan, not the Romans. He warns the Christians in Romans not to disobey the Romans, saying that they do not punish the righteous!\n\n \n Incorrect. Keep in mind that Paul was elaborating to those who were already Christians on theological points. He was not trying to convey the story of Jesus' life in complete summary because the churches to which he was writing already knew that from oral tradition. \n \n Paul does reflect Jesus' teachings, cross reference:\n Romans 12:14 and Luke 6:27-28\n Romans 12:17 and Matthew 5:39\n Romans 13:7 and Mark 12:17\n Romans 13:8-9, Galatians 5:14 and Mark 12:31\n Romans 14:10 and Matthew 7:1-2\n \n In 1 Corinthians Paul gives 3 explicit sayings of Jesus\n 1 Corinthians 7:10 and Mark 10:10-12\n 1 Corinthians 9:14 and Luke 10:7, Matthew 10:10\n 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 and Mark 14:22-24, Matthew 26:26-28, Luke 22:19-20",

   "Richard,\n \nmaximus Not offically but there was always a line of true worshippers. There didn't have to be a real visible church as in buildings and stuff as I saw Hank point that out to you a while back.\n\n Richard,\n I never said that there had to be a real visible church of \"buildings and stuff.\" I said that it was a natural extension of the Church and I explained why. \n \n But there did have to be a real, visible   Church. There had to be because Jesus was real and visible and he instituted a real   and visible Church.\n \n Let me rephrase the question to you in the way that I did for XQ. (He hasn't gotten back to me on this one yet):\n \n Can your church trace its authority back to Peter and the apostles? Paul speaks of the deacons and bishops in his epistles. They were selected by the apostles and authority was transferred by ordination--laying on of hands (1 Timothy 4:14, 1 Timothy 5:22, Acts 15:24). (I also disagree with your claim that you can trace your congregation back to the early Church. You do not believe or teach what the early Church taught). \n \n Where are your bishops and deacons? By whom were they ordained?\n \n \nBy saying the same church scriptually I mean JW's are the closest church on earth to following the example set out in the first century. \n \n I disagree and I think that the Fathers of the Church (those 1st century Christians) would also.\n \n \nThat unbroken line has always been there, although very small at times it was still there, I think your church may well have even burned some of them at the stake which shows that they were there. I'll do some proper research, give me some time it's a busy time for me now. \n \n I'm not sure what you mean about burning. Do you mean that the Church burned heretics?\n \n \nWhat do you think of Matt. 24:14\n\n I think it means that the gospel will be preached throughout the world and then the end will come.",

   "Hank,\n \nI'm not the arbiter of truth, Jesus points to the Holy Spirit which is the arbiter of the truth. You let the church pick what you believe.\n\n Of course I let the Church pick because Jesus wanted the Church to pick. That way, there is one truth--not many truths. He knew what he was doing.\n \n \nIf they are in accord with the teachings of the Holy Spirit as you say, I wouldn't take a chance on mankind messing it up with their interpretation.\n\n That's why men don't interpret, the Church does. 2 Peter 1:20.\n \n \nJesus didn't tell anyone to MAKE anyone do anything. It's a choice, although a difficult one. He did so himself and he taught that your should give up your worldly possessions if you are to be perfect in the will of God. So I don't know what material things you are talking about. Unless Jesus didn't know what he was talking about. Even if you twist the words to mean he said you could keep some things, that's a long way from the wealth of what the church has today. \n \n \n \nAbsolutely, which is why the widow gave all she had and depended on God for her support. And why Jesus said you should give all. It's a sign of your heart.\n\n May I assume that you live in a hut, have one set of clothing, and no modern conveniences? Have you given up everything? I agree that giving up all wordly possessions is a sign of your heart and is the pinnacle of devotion to God but not all are called to that.\n \n What income or wealth assignment are you going to place on believers? $10,000, 30,000, 80,000? The thing is that the millionaire Christian has a place just as well as the poor Christian. He uses his money that he has worked for as a tool for the Kingdom. It's what's in the heart. But you must be able to live, function in society, and provide security for your family also.\n \n \nYou can insist all you want to. But you, and no one else except the Holy Spirit, can decide what I need for a relationship with God.\n\n I am not attempting to dictate what you need for a relationship with God. I'm asserting that if you look at the Revelation of God in history HE tells you what you need for a relationship with him. He instituted the Church and the sacraments.\n \n \nIf I am communicating with God, why would I want a third party involved? Is that the way you communicate with your loved ones when you really want a special time with them?\n\n Ever have a conversation with more than one person at a time? It can be fun, entertaining, enriching. But again, I'm not disparaging time you spend alone with God. There is a place for both.\n \n \nThe Holy Spirit does not lie. In my opinion Paul was a good man and very sincere in what he believed. But he was not near the man Jesus was nor did he have as close a relationship with God as Jesus did. That is evident by the fact that he taught very little of what Jesus taught. So although I'm sure Paul thought he was preaching what God wanted, it's not what was revealed to Jesus and the other great men of God. So I'll stick with what Jesus taught and you can stick with what the church and Paul teaches.\n\n Please see my post to Mizmaxx on Paul's writing on the teaching of Jesus. I only posted some of them, there are more. Keep in mind also that Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 2:2 \"For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.\" He was dedicated to preserving the authentic teachings of Jesus.\n \n How is it that you know Paul was wrong and you are not? I quoted the verse to you that said he was guided by the Holy Spirit. Scripture (Paul) says this, it is not a novelty of the Church.\n \n \nThat's just a belief of yours that the church tells you to believe. \n \n Just a belief of mine that the church tells me to believe?\n \n I would assert then that it is the belief of the Church's that many are called to believe. I don't come up with it myself. I believe it because it is the Church's. It is the Church's because it was Jesus'. \n \n \nNot according to the Protestants.\n\n I already told you that the Protestants are wrong. :)\n \n \nAnd you say I pick what I want to. You would think it would at least have been mentioned one time in each of the gospels.\n\n Why?\n \n \nI don't know how you missed it. You were using Jesus praying in the garden as an example of Jesus praying in public when the disciples were asleep while he was praying. That is what I was pointing out as ludicrous that you changed to mean I was saying calling Jesus a liar was ludicrous which you knew I would not say from the beginning.\n\n Actually, I think you missed it. My quotation of Jesus' prayer was an attempt to refute the vain repetition verse being that Jesus' used repetition himself. That quote was not meant to address public prayer. If Jesus prayed with repetition than he obviously did not condemn repetition. He condemned vanity.\n \n \nWell he was talking to his disciples who were his followers. You don't need a church to be a disciple of Jesus. And what you call the church today doesn't teach anyone to observe all the things Jesus commanded.\n\n And why did he tell these MEN to go out and teach if he didn't want men involved? Didn't you say you didn't need any men to help you?\n \n The Holy Spirit works in and through men.\n \n \nMaximus the church has done lots of good things and I respect the good people that are in the church. But there also have been leaders in the church that have done and promoted evil things. They have persecuted the Jews, they have persecuted those that don't believe as they do, they have persecuted scientist, they have approved of slavery, they have been silent during WWII and others, they have oppressed women, and they have covered up sins, including the harming of children which is one of the worst of all evils, to protect themselves. You can say that's not the church but the people in the church, but it's the leaders in the church that make the decisions and guide the church and those members of the church. Now you want to tell me that I should be depending on people that have committed these kinds of evils to guide me in my spiritual thinking? Not on your life would I ever do that.\n\n Do not leave Jesus because of Judas.\n \n (you need to research your WWII assertion--it is not accurate, there is also more evidence on slavery and science than to demonstrate persecution by the Church)",

   "Maximus this is to you. Now this will burn you up or intrigue you.\n \n I was doing research. If you know about JW's we have lots of \"modern day fulfillments\" of things the already happened in the bible also referred to as \"parallels\". We believe that in 1919 Jehovah's Witnesses became the \"true\" religion. After the Devil came to earth and started World War 1.\n \n Anyone that was involved in First World War including the watchtower was a tool of the devil. We were released from bondage to \"Babylon the great\" or the \"world empire of false religion\". I assume because we didn't do actual killing we were let go.\n \n Now this means one of two things. Until 1919 God was with \"the church\"(or some church) or no church. The watchtower was not considered isolated from \"false religion\" until 1919. There is a black hole in our doctrine about before 1919 and after Paul and the other 11 apostles died. \n \n Also on another note I have never heard of a religion like ours. Most religions think that they are holy and sublime. They also think that what they believe is correct. Jehovah's Witnesses are the generally opposite, and seem to believe we are constantly in the dark or being mislead by false information from the devil seeping in. Secularly we seem to think religion is a ruse and con game used as a tool of coercion. It is like Marxism with a bible. \"Hi, religion is evil. Believe in Jesus?\" Actually with the world situation like it is I wish more religions believed they are inherently flawed or off coarse. It would really help the Middle East about now.\n \n \n *** wachtower 1974 11/1 A Prophetic Drama That Foreshadowed Survival ***\n \n This spiritual paradise of peace and security has certainly been built up on earth since the postwar year of 1919. During World War I and its hard times and persecutions for the Christian witnesses of Jehovah, they incurred a painful measure of divine disfavor due to their compromising course and other shortcomings as Christians. Jehovah God let them be brought into bondage to religious Babylon the Great and her political, military and judicial paramours. But in the postwar year of 1919 the repentant remnant determined to harmonize their united course of action with God's revealed purpose according to the Bible knowledge that he began unfolding to them. So God graciously used his Son Jesus Christ like a modern-day Cyrus to release his repentant people from exile under Babylon the Great. (Isa. 44:28 through 45:6) After their restoration to peaceful relationship with Jehovah God in 1919, as it were to their God-given spiritual homeland, the spiritual paradise was built up, many congregations of Jehovah's Christian witnesses being established around the earth.-Isa. 35:1-10; Ezek. 36:35.",

   " Mizmaxx,\n I was wrong when I said that Paul knew one of the gospel writers. It is more likely that he knew two of them...Luke and Mark. See Colossians 4:10 and 2 Timothy 4:11. It is also thought that Mark was the secretary of Peter. There are a lot of connections.\n\n Yes, I know that Paul's epistles refer to Luke and Mark, that's probably why the later Gospel writers called themselves Mark, then Luke. Note that if you do the addition, no matter which list of apostles from the Gospels you use (there are two), if you include the \"Gospel writers\" they add up to fourteen. Not twelve.\n \n You don't really believe that \"Matthew, Mark, Luke and John\" wrote the Gospels, do you? That's a fabrication, most Christians know that. \n In the same vein, there are only 5 epistles that truly seem to have been written by Paul. The rest were written much later and signed with his name.\n \n \nAccording to scholarly analyses (see Attachment), Romans, I and II Corinthians, I Thessalonians and Galatians are genuine. Opinion is divided on the authenticity of Philippians and Philemon. Ephesians, Colossians, II Thessalonians, The Pastorals (I and II Timothy and Titus) are held by most scholars to be forgeries written considerably later than the time of Paul. The story of Paul's conversion to Christianity and his career as a missionary is given in the Book of Acts and was probably written many years after his death. Therefore its authenticity is questionable.\n \n REFERENCES\n Eddy, Patricia G.; Who Tampered With the Bible?\n Mack, Burton L.; Who Wrote the New Testament?\n Remsberg, John E.; The Christ.\n Robertson, Archibald; The Origins of Christianity.\n Teeple, Howard M.; Personal correspondence with Louis Cable.\n Wells, G. A.; The Historical Evidence for Jesus.\n \n \nActually, it is believed by a lot of scholars that part of Josephus' statements were a forgery but were authentic.\n \n\n Yes, but that does not solve the major problem of the lack of continuity in that section of his writings, nor does it address the unusual lack of thoroughness. As I said, Josephus was a thorough writer trying to record as much information as he could. He wrote chapter after chapter on petty thieves. Such an important character as one who claims to be the Messiah should have deserved much more than a paragraph. As for the continuity, when that paragraph is removed, the flow makes much more sense.\n \n \nThe passage is out of context. Book 18 starts with the Roman taxation under Cyrenius in 6 AD, talks about various Jewish sects at the time, including the Essenes, and a sect of Judas the Galilean. He discusses Herod's building of various cities, the succession of priests and procurators, and so on.\n \n Chapter 3 starts with a sedition against Pilate who planned to slaughter all the Jews but changed his mind. Pilate then used sacred money to supply water to Jerusalem, and the Jews protested. Pilate sent spies among the Jews with concealed weapons, and there was a great massacre.\n \n Then comes the paragraph about Jesus, and immediately after it, Josephus continues:\n \n 'And about the same time another terrible misfortune confounded the Jews . . .'\n \n Josephus, an orthodox Jew, would not have thought the Christian story to be 'another terrible misfortune.' It is only a Christian who would have considered this to be a Jewish tragedy.\n \n Paragraph 3 can be lifted out of the text with no damage to the chapter. It flows better without it. Outside of this tiny paragraph, in all of Josephus's voluminous works, there is not a single reference to Christianity anywhere.\n\n \n \n \nIncorrect. Keep in mind that Paul was elaborating to those who were already Christians on theological points.\n\n How? He was speaking to ppl in Greece, etc. They weren't in the area where Jesus supposedly existed. It also just doesn't make sense for him not to back up his statements with things that Jesus said and did, which he doesn't bother to do. Why wouldn't he mention things like the virgin birth, why does it seem like Paul believes Jesus was born normally? Because that part of the theology didn't yet exist. \n \n \nPaul does reflect Jesus' teachings, cross reference\n\n Romans 12:14 and Luke 6:27-28- Why doesn't Paul say, \"as Jesus said...?\". Why does he begin this monologue, \"As God's messenger, I give each of you God's warning:\"? 12:3\n \n Romans 12:17 and Matthew 5:39 are not at all the same. One speaks of violence, the other evil. Paul goes on to say \"don't quarrel with anyone\"- which is completely contrary to the Gospels, where Jesus goes around overturning tables, setting children against their parents.\n \n Then in Romans 13, Paul outright says that the law and the police don't go after ppl who aren't criminals- he doesn't make an exception for Jesus. Isn't that a little strange that someone whose God was arrested and executed by the gov't should say \"obey the gov't\" and \"the police don't arrest ppl who don't break the law\". Unless he didn't yet know that that's how Jesus was supposed to have died.\n \n Romans 13:7 and Mark 12:17, Jesus says yeah, pay him what's his because that's his face on there, Paul says pay your taxes gladly so that he gov't can continue to serve God!\n \n Romans 13:8-9, Galatians 5:14 and Mark 12:31- I don't remember the commandment that says \"love others as yourself\" (number 11?)- unless the Gospel writer is referring here to Paul! After all Paul was written first... why would Jesus be quoting Paul's writings as \"commandments\"? Because Paul's writings are the earliest extant Christian texts. \n \n Romans 14:10 and Matthew 7:1-2, Paul says \"because we will all be judged by God\", Gospel says \"so you won't be criticized yourselves, because ppl treat you as you treat them.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 7:10 and Mark 10:10-12 Huh? My Bible has Paul saying that a wife must not leave her husband, nor should she remarry after he has left her. And the husband must not divorce his wife. Gospels say that if a man or woman divorces their spouse and remarries, they are committing adultery. One says divorce no good, the other says divorce okay, just don't remarry.\n \n 1 Corinthians 9:14 and Luke 10:7, Matthew 10:10, here Paul seems to speak as though the command is to the ppl doing the supporting, whereas in the Gospels Jesus is describing what to bring and do when you do missionary work. It doesn't, for example, say, \"if you have a missionary in your home, give him all his food, clothes, etc.\", which is what would make sense.\n \n \nTeeple\n The Pauline Epistles considered to be authentic include Romans, 1st & 2nd Corinthians, Galatians, 1st Thessalonians, Philippians, and Philemon. However, they do contain some late Christian interpolations. These include Phil 2:6-11; 1st Cor. 11:23-26; 12:31; 14:1a; 15:3-11. Observe that when the interpolations are removed, the texts immediately above and below the insertion fit together naturally.\nRev.

If one were to take the Gospels literally, as well as Acts, Paul would have bumped into Jesus on several occasions. For one, Paul says that he was a Pharisee and involved in the local law (Acts 22:3-5), so something which drew as many multitudes as the Bible claimed and was so legally significant as Pilate coming to Jerusalem and executing Jesus would not have escaped Paul's attention. Was he on vacation or something? Maybe he was sleeping in when Jesus arrived straddling a colt and a donkey, and more multitudes were witnesses.

It does seem unlikely.\n \n Remember that it was not until much later that the date for Jesus's life and death were set, so he wouldn't have been claiming someone died yesterday who never existed. So the \"contemporaries of Jesus\" wouldn't feel like there was something fishy about the Messiah they'd never heard of before. \n \n Also, the population of Jerusalem at the time wasn't that high, so even if Jesus hadn't been supposedly going around doing miracles and attracting multitudes, it seems strange that Paul wouldn't have run into him at all. Paul's epistles that are genuine are supposed to have been written between 50-60 CE. Paul says he persecuted Jesus' followers, but not Jesus himself, even though Jesus's preaching would have been right in the prime of Paul's life- between 27-30 CE.

Why did he only persecute his followers? How could they both have spent so much time in the same town for so long without ever seeing each other until Jesus meets him as a spirit on the road to Damascus? It just doesn't make sense.\n \n Read Paul's descriptions of Jesus- no virgin story, no parables, no mention of John the Baptist, etc. Read the Gospels in the order they were written.

So he wasn't really into the same mind set. Jesus was not his teacher, but his undead master seeking revenge from the grave for crimes against his followers. Since Saul was not a disciple of Jesus how was he supposed to know or value all of this lore. I mean why would he care about Jesus cousin (died before Jesus)? Mary's virginity? Also parables was Jesus (charismatic leader) thing most other characters in the bible never used them. Infact it was unique to Jesus.

So it is possible that Saul knew of Jesus, but only got involved after the religion Jesus started growing again.",

So first of all is there some reason to think Paul did NOT encounter Jesus? I realize there is nothing in writing where he says he did but that doesn't mean he didn't or even that he didn't write it down.

   "Maximus\n \n Can your church trace its authority back to Peter and the apostles? Paul speaks of the deacons and bishops in his epistles. They were selected by the apostles and authority was transferred by ordination--laying on of hands (1 Timothy 4:14, 1 Timothy 5:22, Acts 15:24). \n\n See end. \n \n \n(I also disagree with your claim that you can trace your congregation back to the early Church. You do not believe \n or teach what the early Church taught).\n\n Please show me where! All I have seen with my experience of other religions compared with JW's is that we follow the Bible so closely it's untrue yet all the others don't really seem to care much for it, I'm not saying you, I'm just being general.\n \n \nWhere are your bishops and deacons? By whom were they ordained?\n\n See end.\n \n \nI disagree and I think that the Fathers of the Church (those 1st century Christians) would also.\n\n Again, show me why or where they disagree! Go to your local kingdom hall for one meeting and then tell me if there's any difference.\n \n \nI think it means that the gospel will be preached throughout the world and then the end will come.\n \n It says that the 'kingdom' will be preached, which will always beg the question 'what's the kingdom'? It's a very powerful thing that it used by almighty God to sanctify or cleanse his glorious name. Take a look at Dan. 2:44. This kingdom will be declared, and it clearly is!\n \n Quoted from 'Mankind's search for God' (WBTS)\n Apostasy-The Way to God Blocked\n How the Clergy Class Was Formed\n 11 Another indication of apostasy was the retreat from the general ministry of all Christians, as Jesus and the apostles had taught, to the exclusive priesthood and hierarchy that developed in Christendom. (Matthew 5:14-16; Romans 10:13-15; 1 Peter 3:15) During the first century, after Jesus' death, his apostles, along with other spiritually qualified Christian elders in Jerusalem, served to counsel and direct the Christian congregation. None exercised superiority over the others.-Galatians 2:9.\n 12 In the year 49 C.E., it became necessary for them to meet together in Jerusalem to resolve questions affecting Christians in general. The Bible account tells us that after open discussion, \"the apostles and the older men [pre\u00b7sby'te\u00b7roi] together with the whole congregation favored sending chosen men from among them to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas, . . . and by their hand they wrote: 'The apostles and the older men, brothers, to those brothers in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the nations: Greetings!'\" Evidently the apostles and elders served as an administrative governing agency for the widespread Christian congregations.-Acts 15:22, 23.\n 13 Now since that governing group in Jerusalem was the early Christian arrangement for general oversight for all Christians, what system of direction did they have in each congregation, at the local level? Paul's letter to Timothy makes it clear that the congregations had overseers (Greek, e\u00b7pi'sko\u00b7pos, source of the word \"episcopal\") who were spiritual elders (pre\u00b7sby'te\u00b7roi), men who were qualified by their conduct and their spirituality to teach their fellow Christians. (1 Timothy 3:1-7; 5:17) In the first century, these men did not constitute a separate clergy class. They did not wear any distinctive garb. Their spirituality was their distinction. In fact, each congregation had a body of elders (overseers), not a monarchical one-man rule.-Acts 20:17; Philippians 1:1.\n 14 It was only as time passed that the word e\u00b7pi'sko\u00b7pos (overseer, superintendent) became converted to \"bishop,\" meaning a priest with jurisdiction over other members of the clergy in his diocese. As the Spanish Jesuit Bernardino Llorca explains: \"First, there was not sufficient distinction made between the bishops and the presbyters, and attention was only paid to the meaning of the words: bishop is the equivalent of superintendent; presbyter is the equivalent of older man. . . . But little by little the distinction became clearer, designating with the name bishop the more important superintendents, who possessed the supreme priestly authority and the faculty to lay on hands and confer the priesthood.\" (Historia de la Iglesia Cat\u00f3lica [History of the Catholic Church]) In fact, bishops began to function in a kind of monarchical system, especially from the beginning of the fourth century. A hierarchy, or ruling body of clergy, was established, and in time the bishop of Rome, claiming to be a successor to Peter, was acknowledged by many as the supreme bishop and pope.\n 15 Today the position of bishop in the different churches of Christendom is a position of prestige and power, usually well remunerated, and often identified with the elite ruling class of each nation. But between their proud and elevated situation and the simplicity of organization under Christ and the elders, or overseers, of the early Christian congregations, there is an enormous difference. And what shall we say of the gulf between Peter and his so-called successors, who have ruled in the sumptuous setting of the Vatican?-Luke 9:58; 1 Peter 5:1-3.",

   "Maximus this is to you. Now this will burn you up or intrigue you.\n \n I was doing research. If you know about JW's we have lots of \"modern day fulfillments\" of things the already happened in the bible also referred to as \"parallels\". We believe that in 1919 Jehovah's Witnesses became the \"true\" religion. After the Devil came to earth and started World War 1.\n \n Anyone that was involved in First World War including the watchtower was a tool of the devil. We were released from bondage to \"Babylon the great\" or the \"world empire of false religion\". I assume because we didn't do actual killing we were let go.\n \n Now this means one of two things. Until 1919 God was with \"the church\"(or some church) or no church. The watchtower was not considered isolated from \"false religion\" until 1919. There is a black hole in our doctrine about before 1919 and after Paul and the other 11 apostles died. \n \n Also on another note I have never heard of a religion like ours. Most religions think that they are holy and sublime. They also think that what they believe is correct. Jehovah's Witnesses are the generally opposite, and seem to believe we are constantly in the dark or being mislead by false information from the devil seeping in. Secularly we seem to think religion is a ruse and con game used as a tool of coercion. It is like Marxism with a bible. \"Hi, religion is evil. Believe in Jesus?\" Actually with the world situation like it is I wish more religions believed they are inherently flawed or off coarse. It would really help the Middle East about now.\n \n \n *** wachtower 1974 11/1 A Prophetic Drama That Foreshadowed Survival ***\n \n This spiritual paradise of peace and security has certainly been built up on earth since the postwar year of 1919. During World War I and its hard times and persecutions for the Christian witnesses of Jehovah, they incurred a painful measure of divine disfavor due to their compromising course and other shortcomings as Christians. Jehovah God let them be brought into bondage to religious Babylon the Great and her political, military and judicial paramours. But in the postwar year of 1919 the repentant remnant determined to harmonize their united course of action with God's revealed purpose according to the Bible knowledge that he began unfolding to them. So God graciously used his Son Jesus Christ like a modern-day Cyrus to release his repentant people from exile under Babylon the Great. (Isa. 44:28 through 45:6) After their restoration to peaceful relationship with Jehovah God in 1919, as it were to their God-given spiritual homeland, the spiritual paradise was built up, many congregations of Jehovah's Christian witnesses being established around the earth.-Isa. 35:1-10; Ezek. 36:35.\n\n XQ,\n Not burning up.\n Not intrigued.\n Just confused.",

Note that if you do the addition, no matter which list of apostles from the Gospels you use (there are two), if you include the \"Gospel writers\" they add up to fourteen. Not twelve.\n \n You don't really believe that \"Matthew, Mark, Luke and John\" wrote the Gospels, do you? That's a fabrication, most Christians know that. \n In the same vein, there are only 5 epistles that truly seem to have been written by Paul. The rest were written much later and signed with his name.\n\n I never claimed that the gospel writers were apostles that's why I wrote \"gospel writers.\" I do believe that \"Matthew, Mark, Luke and John\" wrote the Gospels. I do not believe that Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were necessarily apostles. Matthew and John probably were. Luke and Mark (John Mark if you read Acts) were not.

As I said, Josephus was a thorough writer trying to record as much information as he could. He wrote chapter after chapter on petty thieves. Such an important character as one who claims to be the Messiah should have deserved much more than a paragraph. As for the continuity, when that paragraph is removed, the flow makes much more sense.\n\n Would Josephus, a loyal Jew, as you said give a lot of press to one hated by the Jews? Would he want to give a lot of exposure to one falsely claiming to be the Messiah(as the Jews believed)? Jesus was an important character but not necessarily one he wanted to talk about.\n \n \nHow? He was speaking to ppl in Greece, etc. They weren't in the area where Jesus supposedly existed. It also just doesn't make sense for him not to back up his statements with things that Jesus said and did, which he doesn't bother to do. Why wouldn't he mention things like the virgin birth, why does it seem like Paul believes Jesus was born normally? Because that part of the theology didn't yet exist. \n \n He was speaking to people in Greece etc. where Churches were already founded after missionary work. They knew the gospel.

Maybe he didn't particularly care about Mary's virginity, but how could he not have known about it at all? \n \n When you say that Paul says Jesus was born normally I assume that you are asserting that a natural \"birth\" means a natural \"conception.\" The two are entirely different events. I am only aware that Paul says Jesus was born of a woman. This is true but it does not speak to his conception.",

Paul's letter to Timothy makes it clear that the congregations had overseers (Greek, e\u00b7pi'sko\u00b7pos, source of the word \"episcopal\") who were spiritual elders (pre\u00b7sby'te\u00b7roi), men who were qualified by their conduct and their spirituality to teach their fellow Christians. (1 Timothy 3:1-7; 5:17) In the first century, these men did not constitute a separate clergy class. They did not wear any distinctive garb. Their spirituality was their distinction. In fact, each congregation had a body of elders (overseers), not a monarchical one-man rule.-Acts 20:17; Philippians 1:1.\n 14 It was only as time passed that the word e\u00b7pi'sko\u00b7pos (overseer, superintendent) became converted to \"bishop,\" meaning a priest with jurisdiction over other members of the clergy in his diocese. As the Spanish Jesuit Bernardino Llorca explains: \"First, there was not sufficient distinction made between the bishops and the presbyters, and attention was only paid to the meaning of the words: bishop is the equivalent of superintendent; presbyter is the equivalent of older man. . . . But little by little the distinction became clearer, designating with the name bishop the more important superintendents, who possessed the supreme priestly authority and the faculty to lay on hands and confer the priesthood.\" (Historia de la Iglesia Cat\u00f3lica [History of the Catholic Church]) In fact, bishops began to function in a kind of monarchical system, especially from the beginning of the fourth century. A hierarchy, or ruling body of clergy, was established, and in time the bishop of Rome, claiming to be a successor to Peter, was acknowledged by many as the supreme bishop and pope.\n 15 Today the position of bishop in the different churches of Christendom is a position of prestige and power, usually well remunerated, and often identified with the elite ruling class of each nation. But between their proud and elevated situation and the simplicity of organization under Christ and the elders, or overseers, of the early Christian congregations, there is an enormous difference. And what shall we say of the gulf between Peter and his so-called successors, who have ruled in the sumptuous setting of the Vatican?-Luke 9:58; 1 Peter 5:1-3.\n\n I agree that at the time of Paul there was less distinction among the clergy. However, there was a definite line of authority.You accept the Pauline epistles as legitimate scripture. Paul knew that there was a line of authority in the Church. This authority was passed on.\n \n 2 Thessalonians 3:4 \"And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things which we command.\"\n \n 2 Thessalonians 3:6 \"Now we command you, brehren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ...\"\n 2 Thessalonians 3:14 \"If any one refuses to obey what we say in this letter, note that man, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed.\"\n \n Paul \"excommunicates\" a believer in 1 Corinthians 5.\n \n Also see Acts 15:24-25  in which the apostles chose those who were to teach and told the Gentile brethren not to listen to those they had not given instructions to.",

   "\" The WTS claims it uses the Bible as it's \"supreme authority\". Where in the Bible does anyone count their time in preaching on a slip of paper and are assigned record cards of activity, \n\n \n The apostles and older men located in Jerusalem constituted a governing body that made decisions giving direction to the early Christian congregations. (Acts 15:1-31; 16:1-5) Today Jehovah's witnesses have a Governing Body at their headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. It directs the tremendous worldwide Kingdom witnessing work now being done throughout the earth in fulfillment of the prophecy regarding Jehovah's Kingdom. (Matthew 24:14) This work could never be done without an organization. An individual could never do it on his own. The report slips aren't tallied up against someone's name, there not kept by the elders or transferred to other media, all they are for is determining the total hours spent in the ministry either local, district, national or global. (Mark 6:30)\n Did you know; JW's spent 1,234,796,477 hours preaching and teaching around the world? How do I know that because everyone turns in a report (Mark 6:30)\n \ndetermining this as a \"gauge to their spirituality\"? \n \n Why do you use quotation marks in \"gauge to their spirituality\" who are you quoting? Or is this an unreferenced web site remark?\n \nWhere in the Bible are Pioneers, Auxiliary Pioneers, Bethelites, and Kingdom Halls?\n Fantastic! Also where are mobile phones, computers, fax machines, etc. All these names are for organisational purposes, Apart from the last one, which is just a really cool name for a hall.\n Maximus I found the following comment made by your church, what do think?\n A conference of religious leaders in Spain noted this: \"Perhaps [the churches] are excessively neglectful about that which precisely constitutes the greatest preoccupation of the Witnesses-the home visit, which comes within the apostolic methodology of the primitive church. While the churches, on not a few occasions, limit themselves to constructing their temples, ringing their bells to attract the people and to preaching inside their places of worship, [the Witnesses] follow the apostolic tactic of going from house to house and of taking advantage of every occasion to witness.\"-El Catolicismo, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, September 14, 1975, p. 14.\n \n Where in the Bible does it say that anyone born after 1935 can not go to heaven,\n\n Jesus answers your question with a parable;\n Quoted from watchtower mag. pg. 8,9 12/15 1988,\"A certain man was spreading a grand evening meal, and he invited many. And he sent his slave out . . . to say to the invited ones, 'Come, because things are now ready.' But they all in common started to beg off. The first said to him, 'I bought a field and need to go out and see it; I ask you, Have me excused.' And another said, 'I bought five yoke of cattle and am going to examine them; I ask you, Have me excused.' Still another said, 'I just married a wife and for this reason I cannot come.'\"\n What lame excuses! A field or livestock are normally examined before they are bought, so no real urgency exists to look at them afterward. Similarly, a person's marriage should not prevent him from accepting such an important invitation. So on hearing about these excuses, the master becomes angry and commands his slave:\n \"'Go out quickly into the broad ways and the lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.' In time the slave said, 'Master, what you ordered has been done, and yet there is room.' And the master said to the slave, 'Go out into the roads and the fenced-in places, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. . . . None of those men that were invited shall have a taste of my evening meal.'\"\n What situation is described by the illustration? Well, \"the master\" providing the meal represents Jehovah God; \"the slave\" extending the invitation, Jesus Christ; and the \"grand evening meal,\" the opportunities to be in line for the Kingdom of the heavens.\n Those first to receive the invitation to come in line for the Kingdom were, above all others, the Jewish religious leaders of Jesus' day. However, they rejected the invitation. Thus, beginning particularly at Pentecost 33 C.E., a second invitation was extended to the despised and lowly ones of the Jewish nation. But not enough responded to fill the 144,000 places in God's heavenly Kingdom. So in 36 C.E., three and a half years later, the third and final invitation was extended to uncircumcised non-Jews, and the gathering of such ones continued into the 20th century. Luke 14:1-24.\n So around the time of 1935 was the eventual filling of the 144,000 places in heaven designated by God. There is a lot more to say, but tell me what you think of this?\n \n that Christians are required to attend five meetings a week,\n\n It's really only three separate meetings, Tuesday =1hr, Thursday=2hr, Sunday=2hr. not much of ones life really. This is the biggest education work ever to happen regarding the Bible, and it's all around the world and everyone is welcome.\n \nthat men are prohibited from wearing beards, \n \n I heard this one before, but keep an eye out to see if there ARE any witnesses in your area with beards. I'll bet there are!\n \nand that after a prophecy fails, if the prophet admits he made a mistake, he is no longer a false prophet (see Deut 18:20-22)? \n \n Can you expand a bit? Sorry.\n \nWhere does the Bible say that a person must belong to an organization that will start in the late 19th century and be headquartered in Brooklyn, NY, in order to survive Armageddon?\"\n\n Isaiah 2:2 and Daniel 12:4, 9-10 with 1John 2:17\n \n \n \"On page 7 of the booklet Should You Believe in the Trinity?, unreferenced quotes from Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Hippolytus, and Origen are made. Why are these quotes unreferenced? \n \n I think they're at the back of the brochure; I'll have to check I don't have one. Sorry.\n \nAlso on page 7 of this same booklet, the statement is made, \"Thus, the testimony of the Bible and of history makes it clear that the Trinity was unknown throughout Biblical times and for SEVERAL CENTURIES thereafter.\" Based on the quotes below, how can the Watchtower Society make these claims?\n Because they are arguably true!\n \n \nJustin Martyr (110-165 AD):\n \"... nor to know that the Father of the universe has a Son; who also, being the first-begotten Word of God, is even God.\" - First Apology of Justin, Ch LXIII; \"... but now you will permit me first to recount the prophecies, which I wish to do in order to prove that Christ is called both God and the Lord of hosts ...\" - Dialogue with Trypho, Ch XXXVI; \"Therefore these words testify explicitly that He is witnessed to by Him who established these things, as deserving to be worshipped, as God and as Christ.\" - Ibid, Ch LXIII. \n \n Irenaeus (120-202 AD):\n \"... and to raise up anew all flesh of the whole human race, in order that to Christ Jesus, our Lord, and God, and Saviour, and King ...\" - Against Heresies, Bk 1, Ch 10; \"But that He is in His own right , beyond all men who ever lived, God, and Lord, and King Eternal, and the Incarnate Word, proclaimed by all the prophets and apostles, and by the Spirit Himself, may be seen by all who have attained to even a small portion of the truth.\" - Against Heresies, Bk 3, Ch 19. \n \n Clement of Alexandria (153-217 AD):\n \"For 'before the morning star it was;' and 'in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.'\" and \"This Word, then, the Christ, the cause of both our being at first (for He was in God) and of our well being, this very Word has now appeared as man, He alone being both, both God and man ...\" and \"The Word, who in the beginning bestowed on us life as Creator when He formed us, taught us to live well when He appeared as our Teacher; that as God He might afterwards conduct us to the life which never ends.\" - Exhortation to the Heathen, Ch 1. \n \n Tertullian (145-220 AD):\n \"Him we believe to have been sent by the Father into the virgin, and to have been born of her - being both Man and God, the Son of Man and the Son of God, and to have been called by the name of Jesus Christ.\" and \"... while the mystery of the dispensation is still guarded, which distributes the Unity into a Trinity, placing them in their order the three Persons - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost ...\" - Against Praxeas, Ch 2; \"With these did He then speak, in the Unity of the Trinity, as with His ministers and witnesses.\" and \"...I mean the Word of God, 'through whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.' Now if He too is God, according to John (who says) 'The Word was God'...\" - Against Praxeas, Ch 12. \n \n Hippolytus (170-236 AD):\n \"For he speaks to this effect: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.'\" and \"...'Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.' And by this He showed, that whosoever omitted any one of these, failed in glorifying God perfectly. For it is through this Trinity that the Father is glorified.

Even presidents have gone under the magnifying glass a few times for trying to turn it into \"their\" religion.

I wasn't expecting it until Sunday. Or are you just well prepared? The only thing I may well be away this weekend and wouldn't be able to get a reply before then!\n Also forgot to thank you in my first post, sorry. THANKYOU for the debate hank, I hope we carry on with this fine quality, you've given me a lot to think about. \n Richard.\n\n \n I don't know what to say Richard except thank you for the nice compliment.\n \n Yes I did post early. I already had started preparing different areas that I wanted to discuss so although I needed to see what you were going to say, I had some of it prepared. But your post made me think a lot which is why I like to debate. The way I figure your post is not due till a week from Sunday so have a good trip and be safe.\n \n Maybe I should have waited so you wouldn't have so much time the think about a reply. :)",

   "Maximus,\n \n \nBut can this governing body trace its authority back to the original Church? You say it is okay for someone to govern but by whose authority? Were they elected? appointed? By whom?\n\n \n GOD appoints faithful men to positions of greater responsibility, again by the JW trademark of using the Bible authored by God. \n FollowingQuoted from 'Insight on the Scriptures' (WBTS)\n Qualifications of an overseer, or elder. To attain the office of overseer, the following qualifications must be met: \"The overseer should therefore be irreprehensible, a husband of one wife, moderate in habits, sound in mind, orderly, hospitable, qualified to teach, not a drunken brawler, not a smiter, but reasonable, not belligerent, not a lover of money, a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner, having children in subjection with all seriousness; . . . not a newly converted man, . . . he should also have a fine testimony from people on the outside.\"-1Ti 3:1-7.\n Likewise, in his letter to Titus, in discussing the subject of making appointments of elders, Paul said that in order to qualify as such, a man had to be \"free from accusation, a husband of one wife, having believing children that were not under a charge of debauchery nor unruly. For an overseer must be free from accusation as God's steward, not self-willed, not prone to wrath, not a drunken brawler, not a smiter, not greedy of dishonest gain, but hospitable, a lover of goodness, sound in mind, righteous, loyal, self-controlled, holding firmly to the faithful word as respects his art of teaching, that he may be able both to exhort by the teaching that is healthful and to reprove those who contradict.\" (Tit 1:5-9) The differences in this latter list of qualifications evidently take into account the special needs of the congregations in Crete, where Titus was serving.-Tit 1:10-14.\n \n 11 Paul, when addressing the elders of Ephesus, introduced another activity of holy spirit when he said: \"Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own Son.\" (Acts 20:28) Yes, congregation overseers, or elders, are appointed by holy spirit. In what way? In that appointed elders must meet the qualifications outlined in the inspired Bible. (1 Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-9) They can develop those qualifications only with the help of holy spirit. Further, the body of elders that recommends a new elder prays for the guidance of holy spirit to discern whether he meets the qualifications or not. And the actual appointment is made under the supervision of the spirit-anointed faithful and discreet slave.\n \n \nI have no problem with utilizing things outside of the Bible. But I wonder about some beliefs and concepts put forth when the Bible is said to be the supreme authority.\n\n JW's of the 1st century were not as global as the JW's today. We have no example of global organization from the Bible so we have to follow Jehovah's Holy Spirit alone in making correct decisions regarding organization. \n \nThis is not necessarily an official statement of the Church but rather the statement of a conference of religious leaders in Spain. \n \n No I realise that. I sometimes type to fast and hastily said it was from your church. Sorry.\n \n \nI also commend the JWs on their willingness and zeal in putting forth their message in an apostolic way.\n\n Thank you. I wasn't really looking for commendation though, just trying to make a good point, that my church does follow the Bible.\n \nBut is the message you are putting forth in an apostolic way the apostolic message? I think not.\n\n The main purpose of the Christian organisation of the 1st century was to teach people all over the then known world about God, which they did using the then completed Bible, and we do the exact same thing. Use the Bible I mean, as I,m sure you have seen.\n \nI think that the Bible says nothing of an elect group of 144,000 being filled to capacity in the year 1935.\n\n Correct! But.\n Quoted from 'Revelation God's Grand Climax at hand' (WBTS)\n *** re 125 20 A Multitudinous Great Crowd ***\n 18 During the 1920's and early 1930's, Jehovah's Witnesses had stressed the heavenly hope, both in the publications and in the preaching work. Apparently, the full number of the 144,000 had yet to be filled. But increasing numbers of those who heeded the message and who showed zeal in the witness work came to profess an interest in living forever on the Paradise earth. They had no desire to go to heaven. That was not their calling. They were no part of the little flock but rather of the other sheep. (Luke 12:32; John 10:16) Their being identified in 1935 as the great crowd of other sheep was an indication that the choosing of the 144,000 was then about complete.\n Basically, by about 1935 there were no more people with a burning desire in their hearts to be in heaven, the only people that were coming into the organization were ones like you and me wanting to live on earth. \n \nI think that the parable you quote does not speak to this.\n\n Parables are amazing things that sometimes are made to make one search the scriptures thoroughly to find what they mean. \n Luke 14:16-24\n 16 [Jesus] said to him: \"A certain man was spreading a grand evening meal,\"  \n This represents the 144,000 places set in heaven by God, \n \"and he invited many.\" \n the 144,000 places in heaven.\n 17 \"And he sent his slave out at the hour of the evening meal to say to the invited ones, 'Come, because things are now ready.'\" \n This calling began at Pentecost 33 c.e. starting with the Jewish nation.\n 18 \"But they all in common started to beg off. The first said to him, 'I bought a field and need to go out and see it; I ask you, Have me excused.' 19 And another said, 'I bought five yoke of cattle and am going to examine them; I ask you, Have me excused.' 20 Still another said, 'I just married a wife and for this reason I cannot come.'\"  \n But some liked their lives just the way they were, and weren't willing to accept the new teachings of Christ. Agreed? \n 21 \"So the slave came up and reported these things to his master. Then the householder became wrathful and said to his slave, 'Go out quickly into the broad ways and the lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.'\" \n So now the message is to go to the gentiles. Agreed?\n 22 \"In time the slave said, 'Master, what you ordered has been done, and yet there is room.'\"  \n Even with this is now done there are still spaces left in heaven. Why? Because the Christian organization became overrun with apostasy (2Thess. 2:3) and the invite became unreadable.\n 23 \"And the master said to the slave, 'Go out into the roads and the fenced-in places, and compel them to come in,\" \n So Jesus then instigates a bigger more vast global preaching campaign (before 1935) once again to find these Holy ones.\n \"that my house may be filled.\" With success!!! \n \nI think that the literal interpretation of 144,000 from Revelation 7:4 is wrong.\n \nIf you look at Revelation 14:4 where the 144,000 are mentioned again then one must conclude that the only people getting to heaven were virgin Jewish males.\n\n Following Quotes 'Reasoning from the Scriptures'\n *** rs 167 Heaven ***\n Is the number 144,000 merely symbolic?\n The answer is indicated by the fact that, after mention of the definite number 144,000, Revelation 7:9 refers to \"a great crowd, which no man was able to number.\" If the number 144,000 were not literal it would lack meaning as a contrast to the \"great crowd.\" Viewing the number as literal agrees with Jesus' statement at Matthew 22:14 regarding the Kingdom of the heavens: \"There are many invited, but few chosen.\"\n \n *** rs 166-7 Heaven ***\n Are the 144,000 only natural Jews?\n Rev. 7:4-8: \"I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel: . . . Judah . . . Reuben . . . Gad . . . Asher . . . Naphtali . . . Manasseh . . . Simeon . . . Levi . . . Issachar . . . Zebulun . . . Joseph . . . Benjamin.\" (These cannot be the tribes of natural Israel because there never was a tribe of Joseph, the tribes of Ephraim and Dan are not included in the list here, and the Levites were set aside for service in connection with the temple but were not reckoned as one of the 12 tribes. See Numbers 1:4-16.)\n Rom. 2:28, 29: \"He is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision that which is on the outside upon the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit, and not by a written code.\"\n So not a literal Jew!\n Gal. 3:26-29: \"You are all, in fact, sons of God through your faith in Christ Jesus. . . . There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor freeman, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one person in union with Christ Jesus. Moreover, if you belong to Christ, you are really Abraham's seed, heirs with reference to a promise.\"\n \"Virgins\"\n What characterizes this class is a spiritual virginity. They have avoided spiritual adultery with worldly politics and with false religion. (James 4:4; Revelation 17:5) As the betrothed bride of Christ, they have kept themselves pure, \"without a blemish in among a crooked and twisted generation.\"-Philippians 2:15. The book of revelation is not 100% literal it's very symbolic.\n \n \nI wonder then why Moses and Elijah appear with God at Jesus' Transfiguration in Matthew 17. \n \n It was a vision not a literal presence!\n \n \nI wonder why the Bible tells us that Elijah and Enoch are in heaven (2 Kings 2:11 and Hebrews 11:5).\n\n It doesn't. Their not! No one before Pentecost 33 c.e. has entered into heaven, only the death of Jesus allows this.\n Following Quotes 'Insight on the scritures' (WBTS)\n  Elijah\n Elijah does not die at this time, nor does he go into the invisible spirit realm, but he is transferred to another prophetic assignment. (Joh 3:13) This is shown by the fact that Elisha does not hold any period of mourning for his master. A number of years after his ascension in the windstorm Elijah is still alive and active as a prophet, this time to the king of Judah. Because of the wicked course taken by King Jehoram of Judah, Elijah writes him a letter expressing Jehovah's condemnation, which is fulfilled shortly thereafter.-2Ch 21:12-15;\n Enoch\n Enoch was \"transferred so as not to see death,\" which may mean that God put him in a prophetic trance and then terminated Enoch's life while he was in the trance so that he did not experience the pangs of death. (Ge 5:24; Heb 11:5, 13) However, he was not taken to heaven, in view of Jesus' clear statement at John 3:13 (READ). It appears that, as in the case of Moses' body, Jehovah disposed of Enoch's body, for \"he was nowhere to be found.\"-De 34:5, 6; Jude 9.\n \n \nI wonder why Jesus extended an invitation to heaven to the thief on the cross next to him before the apostles were granted one at Pentecost.\n\n He didn't he told him he would be with him is paradise, which simply means on earth under his direction. The thief would have had no idea of a heavenly calling.\n \nI again commend your zeal and dedication.\n Have leaders of your church ever made false prophecies and what happens when they do?\n Don't see the connection between those verses and the JWs.\n \n Should You Believe in the Trinity? \n http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ \n They haven't. Jesus did. Matthew 16:18, Matthew 18:17-18, Matthew 28:18-20, John 20:23, Luke 10:16. You see, the Catholic Church can trace its authority back to the apostles in an unbroken line. The authority given to the apostles, that is to the early Church, is the authority given to the Catholic Church because they are one and the same. \n I would imagine the same way Paul viewed it. Use it with discretion but without fear to command. Use it to legislate and discipline. Use it to protect the truth and prevent the heresy of false gospels. Use it to protect the faithful from deception and being led astray.\n\n \n Maximus I will have to answer these tommorow, sorry, my wife only allows me a certain amount of time on the computer, LOL. She rules with an iron fist.",

He did so himself and he taught that your should give up your worldly possessions if you are to be perfect in the will of God. So I don't know what material things you are talking about.

Even if you twist the words to mean he said you could keep some things, that's a long way from the wealth of what the church has today.\n\n \nAbsolutely, which is why the widow gave all she had and depended on God for her support.

I realized that the Catholic Church may be the only place in Christendom where Jesus' command to give up all does actually take place. I have already made my case that Jesus' command was not universal and does not apply to all that he calls. Each has his role. But the call is definitely a truth that Jesus conveyed. \n \n The ordinary priest takes a vow of obedience, poverty, and chastity. (Certain orders take this to the ultimate (Franciscans, Dominicans, Missionaries to the Poor, Poor Clares)). But those with religious vocations give up all of their wordly possessions to the point that even the sexual love of another is declined. They truly give their entire self for love of God.

As I do anyone who reads.\n \n \n 1. Sovereignty of God \n \n We believe that God's absolute sovereignty over everything frees us to rest in His complete loving protection over our lives. \n 2. Identity in Christ \n \n We believe our identity in Christ is the basis of who we are and how we live. \n 3. Unconditional Love \n \n We believe God's unconditional love is the source for the relationships of committed love we have with God and each other. \n 4. Relationships of Grace \n \n We believe God's grace applied to our relationships allows us to experience affirmation, trust, vulnerability, submission, healing and freedom. \n 5. Freedom in Christ \n \n We believe Christ's death removed sin as a barrier between God and us and took away all condemnation, so that we are now free to allow God to change us and free to succeed or fail in an atmosphere of grace. \n 6. Authenticity \n \n We believe God's worthiness to be trusted with our lives allows us to pursue integrity, admit limitations and submit to truth. \n 7. Significance of each one \n \n We value one another's significance and potential because of who we are in Christ, not because of status, wealth or abilities. \n 8. Releasing Vision \n \n We are committed to nurturing each other's vision, creativity and abilities so that we can fulfill God's purposes for our lives. \n \n 9. Elder Leadership \n \n We believe the church is to be led by elders who model love and unity with each other and shepherd and protect God's people. \n \n We Believe --- \n \n The Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired Word of God, inerrant in the original documents and of final authority in all matters of faith and practice. \n \n \n There is one God, eternally existent in three persons - Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and He is all-knowing, all-powerful, just, merciful, wise, unchangeable and gracious. \n \n \n Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Son of Man - fully God and fully man - born of a virgin, perfect in His person and eternal in His being. \n \n \n We believe that mankind was created in the image of God and was originally without sin. Because of the sin of Adam and Eve, all of mankind are now sinners both by nature and by choice and are unable to remedy their own lost condition. \n \n \n Jesus Christ died on the cross to rescue us from our helpless state - paying the penalty of our sin - and He rose from the dead on the third day, ascended into heaven, and now sits at God's right hand as our Mediator. \n \n \n The Church, consisting of God's elect, began with the descent of the Holy Spirit on the believers at Pentecost. \n \n \n By God's grace, those who trust in the work of Christ for their salvation inherit eternal life and are sealed with the Holy Spirit. \n \n \n Because salvation is a work of God's grace, believers are eternally secure and released from relying on their own abilities and merits to earn acceptance from God and others. \n \n \n The miracle of God's grace frees believers to love as Christ loved, leading to unity, greater knowledge of Christ, maturity and the expression of gifting for the benefit of the Church. \n \n \n The Lord Jesus Christ will return soon, and there will be a resurrection of the saved to eternal life, and of the lost to eternal and conscious judgment.",

See Numbers 1:4-16.)\n\n \n There never was a tribe of Joseph?\n \n See Genesis 49:28  for the original listing. Joseph is included. Ephraim and Manasseh are sons of Joseph and are two \"half-tribes\" (see Numbers 32:33)So Ephraim should not necessarily be included as he is a son of Joseph and a \"half-tribe.\" It seems that Manasseh (another half tribe)was put in the list in place of Dan for some reason which I don't have the answer for but Joseph and Levi are definitely tribes of Israel. Levi is also listed in the original twelve tribes as brother of Simeon (they just received no inheritance due to being a priestly class).\n \n You can also look at these passages that discuss the tribe of Joseph:\n Joshua 17:14  \"the tribe of Joseph spoke to Joshua...\"\n Joshua 14:3 \"... but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.

   "Maximus,\n \nYes, God does appoint men through other men. The JW trademark is to use the Bible authored by God. So men are appointed and ordained by the laying on of hands as is done in the Bible? (1 Timothy 4:14, 1 Timothy 5:22)\n\n Following quoted from 'Awake' mag. 1991, 8/8 pg.13\n *** g91 8/8 13 Confirmation-Is It a Christian Requirement? ***\n A Scriptural Basis?\n The account found at Acts 8:14-17 is often used as a basis for confirmation. However, this laying on of the hands to receive holy spirit was a unique occasion. How so? The Samaritans were not Jewish proselytes. Hence, they became the first non-Israelites to be added to the Christian congregation. When the disciple Philip preached in Samaria, many Samaritans \"proceeded to be baptized, both men and women,\" but they did not immediately receive the holy spirit. (Acts 8:12) Why?\n Remember, it was to Peter that Christ Jesus entrusted \"the keys of the kingdom\"-the privilege of first presenting the opportunity for entry into \"the kingdom of the heavens\" for different groups of converts. (Matthew 16:19) So it was not until Peter and John went to Samaria and laid their hands on these first non-Jewish disciples that holy spirit was poured out on them as a token of their prospective membership in \"the kingdom of the heavens.\"\n Some see in Acts 19:1-6 evidence that early Christians had a separate rite following baptism. In this case, however, it is obvious that the reason for withholding holy spirit from some disciples in the city of Ephesus was that these new believers were baptized \"in John's baptism,\" which was no longer valid. (See also Acts 18:24-26.) When this was explained to them, they quickly \"got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.\" And in this instance, the apostle Paul \"laid his hands upon them\" so that they would receive some of the miraculous gifts of God's holy spirit besides being adopted as God's spiritual sons.-Romans 8:15, 16.\n Of these accounts, the New Dictionary of Theology says: \"No direct continuity of usage can be traced to these occurrences, and, even if they do provide some precedent, it is doubtful whether they should be viewed as normative for Christian initiation in the way that water-baptism is. . . . The Acts of the Apostles has many instances of the use of water-baptism without a subsequent laying on of hands (so that these instances in fact appear as exceptions).\" Yes, these were exceptional actions to cope with exceptional circumstances.\n \"The rite called 'confirmation,'\" concludes the New Dictionary of Theology, \"has become a 'rite in search of a theology.'\" It is, in fact, an unscriptural ritual, a product of faulty teachings, and certainly not a requirement for Christians.\n Jw's don't practice the 'laying on of the hands because we feel that it was only done in extreme circumstances.\n \nInteresting, my bible says \"bishop\" instead of overseer and it also talks of deacons.\n Again, my Bible says \"bishop\" instead of overseer. I would be interested to know what the Greek is. I will have to research.\n\n Did you find the Greek?\n \nDo you have a \"body of elders\" that has been appointed by previous bodies of elders \"guided by the Holy Spirit and supervised by the faithful\" that can trace its way back to the original Church?\n\n As I've said before, NO! but we follow their example and are the prophesied resurrected Christian organization foretold in the Bible. \n \nThere weren't any JWs in the 1st century. \n\n Yes there were! The first century Christians were Jehovah's (God's name) witnesses (People that taught his requirements) \n \nYour church follows your interpretation of the Bible--an interpretation that is inconsistent with Christian history.\n\n Inconsistent with church history yes, but not inconsistent with the organization that Jesus started.\n \nWhat do you mean by the \"then completed Bible?\"\n\n well they mainly used the Hebrew scriptures to convince the Jews of the Christ, today we use the whole thing to convince you of the time you are living in.\n \nJohn 10:16 says that there will be one flock, not one flock to stay on earth and one to go to heaven.\n\n John 10:16 \n 16 \"And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold;\n So there is two folds????\n those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd. \n One united purpose under the direction of Christ.\n \n I believe Jesus is speaking to the fact that more peoples than the Jews alone would be saved. I just wonder who was keeping a tally of who went to heaven and adding it up so very accurately to reach 144,000. He must have been a grand historian to keep up with this throughout time, a grand mathematician, and a grand prophet to see who was worthy and going to heaven.\n\n Job 36:4, and 37:16\n \nSo since 1935 no one wants to see heaven? No one desires for heaven after the magical year of 1935? And I'm still confused as to how this magical year was determined.\n\n I never said that, I said that we don't have a burning desire to be in heaven, it's not our home we belong on earth. I would love to see heaven and I'm sure you would too, but I don't want to live there all the time I like the amazing things I see all around me the physical world is outstanding and needs much more exploration before I go anywhere, this is why I know I belong on earth in a physical world.\n \nAre you sure that the 144,000 are the ones going to heaven? Revelation says that the 144,000 are on earth (see Revelation 7:1-8).\n\n Cross-reference it with Revelation 14:4.\n Revelation 14:4\n 4\"... These were bought from among mankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb,\"\n So they are no longer part of mankind. \n \nYou say to beware of Revelation because there is so much symbolism and I say the same thing. I'm just wondering how 144,000 has been picked for a literal interpretation.\n\n \n Revelation 7:4-9\n 4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:\n Then follows the tribal listings, all equal in value. \n \n 9 After these things I saw, and, look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues,\n So with the aforementioned number of 144,000 in mind, how would mentioning \"a great crowd which no man was able to number\" make sense in contrast to the 144,000. I mean if you were to mention a number to someone like; I've just got 33 eggs out of this hen house, but I don't know how many I'm gonna get out of the next hen house, why would any one doubt the number of eggs you already have? Sorry about the whole egg thing!!! It was my wife's idea! So don't blame me.\n \nThe great crowd appears to stand at the throne of God in Heaven. (Rev 7:9-17).\n\n  Following quoted from Watchtower mag. 1995, 2/1, pg.15\n *** w95 2/1 15 A Great Crowd Rendering Sacred Service ***\n \"Standing Before the Throne\"\n 5 In the vision given to the apostle John, he saw them \"standing before the throne and before the Lamb.\" (Revelation 7:9) Their standing before the throne of God, as described in this context, indicates that they give full recognition to Jehovah's sovereignty. This includes much. For example: (1) They acknowledge Jehovah's right to decide for his servants what is good and what is bad. (Genesis 2:16, 17; Isaiah 5:20, 21) (2) They listen to Jehovah as he speaks to them through his Word. (Deuteronomy 6:1-3; 2 Peter 1:19-21) (3) They appreciate the importance of submitting to those whom Jehovah has entrusted with oversight. (1 Corinthians 11:3; Ephesians 5:22, 23; 6:1-3; Hebrews 13:17) (4) Though imperfect, they earnestly endeavor to respond to theocratic direction, not grudgingly, but readily, from the heart. (Proverbs 3:1; James 3:17, 18) They are before the throne to render sacred service to Jehovah, whom they profoundly respect and deeply love. In the case of this great crowd, their \"standing\" before the throne indicates the approval of the One seated on the throne. (Compare Revelation 6:16, 17.) \n \n \n The book of revelation is not 100% literal it's very symbolic.\n\n \nYes, that's what I'm trying to tell you. \n\n Not 100% literal, but it is in places!!!\n \n\"Today you will be with me in Paradise\" means \"Today I will leave you here on earth (after you are physically dead from crucifixion) while I go up to heaven? But I will direct you?\" So the thief stayed on earth after his crucifixion? Why would the thief not be able to have a heavenly calling when Jesus called him to heaven?\n\n following quoted from 'Reasoning from the scriptures' (WBTS)\n *** rs 287 Paradise ***\n What points to this Paradise as being earthly?\n The Hebrew Scriptures had never led faithful Jews to expect a reward of heavenly life. Those Scriptures pointed to the restoration of Paradise here on earth. Daniel 7:13, 14 had foretold that when \"rulership and dignity and kingdom\" would be given to the Messiah, \"the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him.\" Those subjects of the Kingdom would be here on the earth. By what he said to Jesus, the evildoer was evidently expressing the hope that Jesus would remember him when that time came.\n How, then, would Jesus be with the evildoer? By raising him from the dead, making provision for his physical needs, and extending to him the opportunity to learn and conform to Jehovah's requirements for eternal life. (John 5:28, 29) Jesus saw in the evildoer's repentant and respectful attitude a basis for including him among the billions who will be resurrected to earthly life and the opportunity to prove their worthiness to live forever in Paradise.\n \n Maximus I know I've still missed some of your questions but this is already a long enough post as it is, so just let me know if you still want me to explain any of them.",

   "Richard, \n \nFollowing quoted from 'Awake' mag. 1991, 8/8 pg.13\n *** g91 8/8 13 Confirmation-Is It a Christian Requirement? ***\n A Scriptural Basis?\n The account found at Acts 8:14-17 is often used as a basis for confirmation. However, this laying on of the hands to receive holy spirit was a unique occasion. How so? The Samaritans were not Jewish proselytes. Hence, they became the first non-Israelites to be added to the Christian congregation. When the disciple Philip preached in Samaria, many Samaritans \"proceeded to be baptized, both men and women,\" but they did not immediately receive the holy spirit. (Acts 8:12) Why?\n Remember, it was to Peter that Christ Jesus entrusted \"the keys of the kingdom\"-the privilege of first presenting the opportunity for entry into \"the kingdom of the heavens\" for different groups of converts. (Matthew 16:19) So it was not until Peter and John went to Samaria and laid their hands on these first non-Jewish disciples that holy spirit was poured out on them as a token of their prospective membership in \"the kingdom of the heavens.\"\n Some see in Acts 19:1-6 evidence that early Christians had a separate rite following baptism. In this case, however, it is obvious that the reason for withholding holy spirit from some disciples in the city of Ephesus was that these new believers were baptized \"in John's baptism,\" which was no longer valid. (See also Acts 18:24-26.) When this was explained to them, they quickly \"got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.\" And in this instance, the apostle Paul \"laid his hands upon them\" so that they would receive some of the miraculous gifts of God's holy spirit besides being adopted as God's spiritual sons.-Romans 8:15, 16.\n Of these accounts, the New Dictionary of Theology says: \"No direct continuity of usage can be traced to these occurrences, and, even if they do provide some precedent, it is doubtful whether they should be viewed as normative for Christian initiation in the way that water-baptism is. . . . The Acts of the Apostles has many instances of the use of water-baptism without a subsequent laying on of hands (so that these instances in fact appear as exceptions).\" Yes, these were exceptional actions to cope with exceptional circumstances.\n \"The rite called 'confirmation,'\" concludes the New Dictionary of Theology, \"has become a 'rite in search of a theology.'\" It is, in fact, an unscriptural ritual, a product of faulty teachings, and certainly not a requirement for Christians.\n Jw's don't practice the 'laying on of the hands because we feel that it was only done in extreme circumstances.\n \n I was not writing about confirmation. I was writing about ordination and whether any of your elders can be traced back to the Church that Christ started. It seems that it cannot. I did not mention the above verses of Acts that you cite. I mentioned Acts 15:24-27  where it shows that leaders in the Church must be appointed by those coming before them--to the apostles, to Christ. I also cited Timothy but your excerpt does not address those verses. Here is how I stated it:\n \n Yes, God does appoint men through other men. The JW trademark is to use the Bible authored by God. So men are appointed and ordained by the laying on of hands as is done in the Bible? (1 Timothy 4:14, 1 Timothy 5:22)\n \n Did you find the Greek?\n\n Working on it.\n \n \nAs I've said before, NO! but we follow their example and are the prophesied resurrected Christian organization foretold in the Bible. \n \n You follow the example of whom? Surely you do not mean that you follow the example of the first Christians and the original elders that can be traced back to Christ.\n \n I think that the JW prophecies are a bit outlandish to tell you the truth. They have no sound foundation in sound scripture. The verses that you always quote to substantiate the prophecies usually have no literal reference and usually a very, very vague figurative reference to the prophecies they are supposed to support.\n \n \nYes there were! The first century Christians were Jehovah's (God's name) witnesses (People that taught his requirements) \n \n \n \nInconsistent with church history yes, but not inconsistent with the organization that Jesus started.\n\n No. The first century Christians were nothing like Jehovah's witnesses except in their evangelistic zeal. The only people similar to JWs in the first century were heretics. 1st century Christians believed in the Trinity, in the real presence of the Eucharist, in Jesus' Godhood, etc.\n \n \n \nJohn 10:16 \n 16 \"And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold;\n So there is two folds????\n those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, AND THEY WILL BECOME ONE FLOCK, one shepherd. \n One united purpose under the direction of Christ.\n\n\n I think you reiterate my point. Jesus brought those of other folds into his one flock--Jews, Gentiles, Greek, Roman, slave, freeman--all become the same as a Christian. \n \n By the way, what do you think of 2 Peter 3:9 in relation to the 144,000: \"The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness, but is forbearing toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.\"\n \n \nJob 36:4, and 37:16\n\n I'm not sure how these verses relate to someone keeping a record of how many people have made it into heaven. Are you saying that Jesus is keeping the tally? But Jesus did not say that 1935 was the cut off point. Someone here on earth did. Who tallied the figures and decided 1935 was the date when the 144,000 was filled?\n \n \nSo since 1935 no one wants to see heaven? No one desires for heaven after the magical year of 1935? And I'm still confused as to how this magical year was determined. \n \nI never said that, I said that we don't have a burning desire to be in heaven, it's not our home we belong on earth. I would love to see heaven and I'm sure you would too, but I don't want to live there all the time I like the amazing things I see all around me the physical world is outstanding and needs much more exploration before I go anywhere, this is why I know I belong on earth in a physical world.\n \n Is there much difference in what I said and what you said? So since 1935 no one has a \"burning desire to be in heaven?\" How do you know/how do the JWs know what people desire in their hearts? \n \n \n9 After these things I saw, and, look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues,\n So with the aforementioned number of 144,000 in mind, how would mentioning \"a great crowd which no man was able to number\" make sense in contrast to the 144,000. I mean if you were to mention a number to someone like; I've just got 33 eggs out of this hen house, but I don't know how many I'm gonna get out of the next hen house, why would any one doubt the number of eggs you already have?

He gets 144,000 then he goes on to the next hen house or he stops altogether?",

   "Peter the prime apostile dear God what are you thinking! That was the debate Jesus kept putting an end to.I don't know what scripture you think you have to back that claim up. Anyone here remember Jesus washing their feet, anyone?\n\n XQ,\n This is what I am thinking. Here is the scripture to back it up. I originally wrote this to someone else so some of it may not sound exactly right. Sorry its so long but I think all of it is important. (It also addresses Nallyo's statement on Peter's confession of faith):\n \n Do you believe that a man should be the head of a Christian household? (Scripture tells us he should-the presentation of God the Father, Jesus taking the form of man, Adam being the first human creation and woman being created from man, etc.) (This is not misogyny either--Ephesians 5 is the foundation).\n \n If you answered yes to the above question then think about this: Why would God do anything less with his own household, the Church? It has been so throughout the history of the world of Judaism and Christianity. God always put someone in charge of his people to be his voice and administrator on earth. He always placed a father to lead the household of God-Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, the judges, Saul, David, Solomon...Jesus...then Peter...then the Popes...the fathers of the household. This is a simple explanation that couples with the overwhelming scriptural evidence for Peter's primacy that shows us the nature of God and his plan for his kingdom. \n \n Peter the Rock\n There are many problems with a denial of Peter as the foundation of the Church in Matthew 16. There are the problems of language and translation, grammar, geography, significance of the keys as it relates to the Old Testament, the reason for name changes, and the testament of the Church Fathers. There are too many indications in scripture of Peter's primacy to be discounted as mere coincidence.\n \n Was it necessary that Christ establish Peter as the anchor and foundation of his Church? One might just as well ask if the incarnation of Christ was needed by God our Father to bring about our salvation. God is omnipotent and omniscient so it is a denial of God to say that he could not grant us salvation without embodying Himself in Christ. Yet, he sent Christ, though He is capable of performing Christ's mission Himself without taking on human form (excluding any Trinitarian chicken versus egg tangents). Why did He do this? We can never fully know. We can never fully grasp, as humans, God's plan and will. Yet He did will that Christ be our Savior. Perhaps, it was the best way to make humans understand (as much as possible) his plan. He related to us on our level. So too, Christ did not need Peter, but he chose Peter. Christ was the most efficacious way of bringing about our salvation and Peter was the most efficacious way of establishing Christ's Church on earth. The statement of Paul on Christ does not exclude the statement of Christ on Peter. As Christ was the cornerstone that the Jews rejected because they didn't recognize him, Peter is the stone of foundation for the Church that Protestants reject because they do not recognize him.\n \n In Greek, \"Petros\" is used to refer to the name of Peter while \"petra\" is used to refer to the rock. The claim is that \"petros\" refers to a small stone, while \"petra\" refers to a massive rock. Therefore, Christ is referring to Peter as a small stone and to the declaration of faith or Himself as the large stone. There are several problems with this argument. The major problem is the fact that the Greek does not matter. Jesus did not speak in Greek; he spoke in Aramaic. Matthew's Gospel was originally written in Aramaic. In Aramaic the word for rock is \"kepha.\" Remember that Peter is referred to as Cephas and Kephas in scripture also.\n \n The use of \"petros\" and \"petra\" came about with the translation from Aramaic to Greek. The Greek word for rock, \"petra,\" is feminine in gender. Although it could be applied to the reference to a stone rock, it could not be applied to Peter as a name because he was obviously a male. The substitution of the masculine \"petros\" was necessary. That is why it appears to many whom are ignorant of the subtleties of Greek (myself included) that Jesus is saying, \"You are a little rock (petros) but upon this big rock (petra) I build my Church.\" Another refutation of this meaning is the fact that petros and petra  were synonyms in first century Greek. The distinction between the two words was gone by the first century. If the author wanted to make a distinction he would have used the Greek word lithos.\n \n So for a closer idea of what Christ said, one must substitute the Aramaic, \"You are kepha and upon this kepha I build my Church.\" The true play on words Jesus intended can be seen using the Aramaic. The English rendering of this is closer to the original than the Greek because English nouns do not express gender. It could just as well be written, \"You are Rock and upon this rock I will build my Church.\" ** The name change, in itself, is significant. The change of name was a change of role or vocation as in the name changes pronounced by God upon Abram (Abraham) to become the father of the faith and Jacob ( Israel) to become the progenitor of the tribes of Israel named after his sons. (If Jesus would have said, \"You are Simon and on the rock  of your profession I build my Church\" then I could see your idea on Peter's profession. However, with the name change occurring at that very moment along with the grammar problems, and what I discuss below, this theory does not hold up). \n \n (** from www.catholic.com click on Peter and the Papacy) \n \n One must also consider the geography. Jesus and the apostles were in the district of Caesarea Philippi (Matthew 16:13). This city was built and named by Philip Herod in honor of Caesar Augustus to gain favor with Rome. The city was formerly named Panias in ancient times in honor of the god Pan. The ruins of this ancient city lie near a huge rock promontory 200 feet high and 500 feet long that are part of the Mount Hermon range of mountains. Pagan idols once decorated this mountain. Father Stanley Jaki describes it thus in his book And On This Rock, \"A splendid pagan city lying in clear sight of a huge wall of rock. At the top of that wall there glitters the white marble of a temple dedicated to Caesar. At the bottom, there is an outwardly idyllic sanctuary of Pan. Immediately to the left of that sanctuary there is a fathomless cavity full of water, one of the three sources of the Jordan.\" One of three sources of the river Jordan flowed from this mountain. The Jordan gave life to Israel. Jesus knew the power of symbolism, as no one will argue when they read the numerous parables of the gospels. The faith of Christianity flows through the rock of Peter to give life as the Jordan flowed through the other rock. The cavity mentioned in the quote was known by the inhabitants as the \"Gates of Sheol\" -but the gates of hell would not prevail against Peter and the Church. Besides the symbolism effected above, Jesus was definitely trying to drive home two important points to the apostles: 1) Christ is true God, not Caesar or Pan 2) the temple of the false gods are built upon a huge, unmovable rock but Christ's Church would be built upon the more immense rock of Peter. Remember Jesus' teaching earlier in Matthew that one must build upon a foundation of rock, not upon sand. The Church of Christ is built upon Christ the cornerstone primarily and Peter the Rock secondarily. ** \n \n (**Patrick Madrid, Pope Fiction (Santa Fe: Basilica Press, 1999), 37-50. Karl Keating, Catholicism and Fundamentalism (San Francisco: Ignatius Press), 198-214)\n \n The next issue is the \"keys of the kingdom.\" Again Jesus uses Old Testament parallel and symbolism. You say that the authority to bind and loose was given to all of the apostles as indicated by the plural Greek in Matthew 18:18. I have no argument with that. What you don't mention is the fact that it was given to Peter first and in a special way in Matthew 16:19  and this is indicated by use of the singular pronoun. Only Peter was given the keys. What's the big deal about the keys? Read Isaiah 22:15-25. In ancient times cities were walled. Huge gates guarded the entrance and could only be unlocked by huge keys. The kingdoms of ancient times were obviously ruled by kings. However, the king could not be continuously running to the gates to let people into the city. So the king gave the keys to the city to his steward. Keys that were so big the steward had to carry them on his shoulder. The steward controlled whom the king would and would not see. (This is the origin of the modern honor of giving someone a key to the city although I just learned this recently). \n \n As one reads Isaiah 22, he realizes how much authority the steward possessed. He was second only to the King. He was Prime Minister. Peter was designated as the steward/prime minister of Christ. Christ is the King. Look at the Old Testament reference to Daniel 7 in Luke 1:32-33, \"...and the Lord will give to him the throne of David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n Then read closely the passage of Isaiah... \"Come, go to this steward, to Shebna, who is over the household...and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your girdle on him, and will commit your authority to his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David; he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. And I will fasten him like a peg in a sure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house. And they will hang on him the whole weight of his father's house, the offspring and issue...\" Jesus knew Old Testament scripture better than anyone. He was making parallels between the keys of his heavenly kingdom and the way the keys were passed in the ancient kingdoms of Israel! Jesus would ascend his throne in heaven and leave Peter as his steward on earth (thus Peter's supremacy as Pastor does not contradict Christ's role as chief shepherd, rather Peter's supremacy comes from and is designated by Christ to rule the earthly Church once Christ was in heaven). All authority is committed to Peter's hand to rule over the household of his Father. \"None shall open what he shuts\"=none shall loose what he has bound and vice versa. He would become a throne of honor to the father but he does not detract from the Father. He has only the power granted to him by Christ but this power is much greater than Protestants pretend. \n \n Now consider also the significance of the pope speaking ex cathedra, that is \"from the chair.\" What chair and why is this chair so important? This chair is the chair of Moses. In Matthew 23  Jesus told his disciples to do what the Pharisees told them to do because they sat on the chair of Moses. \"Do what they tell you, but not what they do.\" Read Exodus 18  explaining the chair of Moses. It was the chair of judgement, the chair from which Moses instituted God's laws. Jesus put a new steward in the chair. As Moses was given his authority at Mount Sinai by God, Peter was given his at the mountain of Caesarea Philippi by Jesus. Moses had the power to judge, \"Moses sat to judge the people.\" He also had teaching authority, \"and you shall teach them the statutes and the decisions, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.\" Peter has these powers because he sits on the new chair of the Church. Moses spoke for God and Peter spoke for Jesus. \n \n Another clear example of Peter's primacy can be found in the Gospel of John, chapter 21: 15-19. Jesus' words here designate Peter as shepherd. Jesus again singles out Peter to lead the flock, in effect Jesus appoints Peter to be the chief shepherd. The Church did not appoint Peter shepherd, it only recognizes that Christ appointed him shepherd. The Church is obedient to Christ in accepting Peter. If one thinks that the designation of shepherd is not a designation of leadership then remember how often Christ referred to himself as the shepherd. \n \n Now, there is a volume of other evidence pointing toward Peter as prime minister that is more than coincidence, as I mentioned above. Although Peter was not the first to be called, after being called he always seemed to be first. In Matthew 10  he is listed first in the list of the apostles. The Greek word protos is used to designate him. This word means \"foremost,\" \"best,\" or \"chief.\" Peter's name is listed first in every scriptural listing of the apostles and sometimes they are referred to as \"Peter and the others.\" (Judas is always listed last). Peter's name is mentioned 195 times in the New Testament, more than all of the other apostles added together. The next closest is John at 34 times. Jesus chose Peter's boat from which to preach and work miracles. Peter is the only apostle to be personally prayed for by Jesus (Luke 22:31-32) and he tells Peter to \"strengthen his brethren.\" The risen Christ appeared first to Peter (Luke 24:34, 1 Corinthians 15:5) then the other apostles. Peter headed the meeting to replace Judas, he led the apostles in preaching on Pentecost and received the first converts, he performed the first pentecost miracle, inflicted the first punishment, excommunicated the first heretic, etc. The Church Fathers also testify to Peter's primacy.\n \n We must attempt to read scripture as the Jews would read it within the context of geography, Old Testament references, tradition, and history.",

This is a simple explanation that couples with the overwhelming scriptural evidence for Peter's primacy that shows us the nature of God and his plan for his kingdom. \n \n Peter the Rock\n There are many problems with a denial of Peter as the foundation of the Church in Matthew 16. There are the problems of language and translation, grammar, geography, significance of the keys as it relates to the Old Testament, the reason for name changes, and the testament of the Church Fathers. There are too many indications in scripture of Peter's primacy to be discounted as mere coincidence.\n \n Was it necessary that Christ establish Peter as the anchor and foundation of his Church? One might just as well ask if the incarnation of Christ was needed by God our Father to bring about our salvation. God is omnipotent and omniscient so it is a denial of God to say that he could not grant us salvation without embodying Himself in Christ. Yet, he sent Christ, though He is capable of performing Christ's mission Himself without taking on human form (excluding any Trinitarian chicken versus egg tangents). Why did He do this? We can never fully know. We can never fully grasp, as humans, God's plan and will. Yet He did will that Christ be our Savior. Perhaps, it was the best way to make humans understand (as much as possible) his plan. He related to us on our level. So too, Christ did not need Peter, but he chose Peter. Christ was the most efficacious way of bringing about our salvation and Peter was the most efficacious way of establishing Christ's Church on earth. The statement of Paul on Christ does not exclude the statement of Christ on Peter. As Christ was the cornerstone that the Jews rejected because they didn't recognize him, Peter is the stone of foundation for the Church that Protestants reject because they do not recognize him.\n \n In Greek, \"Petros\" is used to refer to the name of Peter while \"petra\" is used to refer to the rock. The claim is that \"petros\" refers to a small stone, while \"petra\" refers to a massive rock. Therefore, Christ is referring to Peter as a small stone and to the declaration of faith or Himself as the large stone. There are several problems with this argument. The major problem is the fact that the Greek does not matter. Jesus did not speak in Greek; he spoke in Aramaic. Matthew's Gospel was originally written in Aramaic. In Aramaic the word for rock is \"kepha.\" Remember that Peter is referred to as Cephas and Kephas in scripture also.\n \n The use of \"petros\" and \"petra\" came about with the translation from Aramaic to Greek. The Greek word for rock, \"petra,\" is feminine in gender. Although it could be applied to the reference to a stone rock, it could not be applied to Peter as a name because he was obviously a male. The substitution of the masculine \"petros\" was necessary. That is why it appears to many whom are ignorant of the subtleties of Greek (myself included) that Jesus is saying, \"You are a little rock (petros) but upon this big rock (petra) I build my Church.\" Another refutation of this meaning is the fact that petros and petra  were synonyms in first century Greek. The distinction between the two words was gone by the first century. If the author wanted to make a distinction he would have used the Greek word lithos.\n \n So for a closer idea of what Christ said, one must substitute the Aramaic, \"You are kepha and upon this kepha I build my Church.\" The true play on words Jesus intended can be seen using the Aramaic. The English rendering of this is closer to the original than the Greek because English nouns do not express gender. It could just as well be written, \"You are Rock and upon this rock I will build my Church.\" ** The name change, in itself, is significant. The change of name was a change of role or vocation as in the name changes pronounced by God upon Abram (Abraham) to become the father of the faith and Jacob ( Israel) to become the progenitor of the tribes of Israel named after his sons. (If Jesus would have said, \"You are Simon and on the rock  of your profession I build my Church\" then I could see your idea on Peter's profession. However, with the name change occurring at that very moment along with the grammar problems, and what I discuss below, this theory does not hold up). \n \n (** from www.catholic.com click on Peter and the Papacy) \n \n One must also consider the geography. Jesus and the apostles were in the district of Caesarea Philippi (Matthew 16:13). This city was built and named by Philip Herod in honor of Caesar Augustus to gain favor with Rome. The city was formerly named Panias in ancient times in honor of the god Pan. The ruins of this ancient city lie near a huge rock promontory 200 feet high and 500 feet long that are part of the Mount Hermon range of mountains. Pagan idols once decorated this mountain. Father Stanley Jaki describes it thus in his book And On This Rock, \"A splendid pagan city lying in clear sight of a huge wall of rock. At the top of that wall there glitters the white marble of a temple dedicated to Caesar. At the bottom, there is an outwardly idyllic sanctuary of Pan. Immediately to the left of that sanctuary there is a fathomless cavity full of water, one of the three sources of the Jordan.\" One of three sources of the river Jordan flowed from this mountain. The Jordan gave life to Israel. Jesus knew the power of symbolism, as no one will argue when they read the numerous parables of the gospels. The faith of Christianity flows through the rock of Peter to give life as the Jordan flowed through the other rock. The cavity mentioned in the quote was known by the inhabitants as the \"Gates of Sheol\" -but the gates of hell would not prevail against Peter and the Church. Besides the symbolism effected above, Jesus was definitely trying to drive home two important points to the apostles: 1) Christ is true God, not Caesar or Pan 2) the temple of the false gods are built upon a huge, unmovable rock but Christ's Church would be built upon the more immense rock of Peter. Remember Jesus' teaching earlier in Matthew that one must build upon a foundation of rock, not upon sand. The Church of Christ is built upon Christ the cornerstone primarily and Peter the Rock secondarily. ** \n \n (**Patrick Madrid, Pope Fiction (Santa Fe: Basilica Press, 1999), 37-50. Karl Keating, Catholicism and Fundamentalism (San Francisco: Ignatius Press), 198-214)\n \n The next issue is the \"keys of the kingdom.\" Again Jesus uses Old Testament parallel and symbolism. You say that the authority to bind and loose was given to all of the apostles as indicated by the plural Greek in Matthew 18:18. I have no argument with that. What you don't mention is the fact that it was given to Peter first and in a special way in Matthew 16:19  and this is indicated by use of the singular pronoun. Only Peter was given the keys. What's the big deal about the keys? Read Isaiah 22:15-25. In ancient times cities were walled. Huge gates guarded the entrance and could only be unlocked by huge keys. The kingdoms of ancient times were obviously ruled by kings. However, the king could not be continuously running to the gates to let people into the city. So the king gave the keys to the city to his steward. Keys that were so big the steward had to carry them on his shoulder. The steward controlled whom the king would and would not see. (This is the origin of the modern honor of giving someone a key to the city although I just learned this recently). \n \n As one reads Isaiah 22, he realizes how much authority the steward possessed. He was second only to the King. He was Prime Minister. Peter was designated as the steward/prime minister of Christ. Christ is the King. Look at the Old Testament reference to Daniel 7 in Luke 1:32-33, \"...and the Lord will give to him the throne of David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n Then read closely the passage of Isaiah... \"Come, go to this steward, to Shebna, who is over the household...and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your girdle on him, and will commit your authority to his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David; he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. And I will fasten him like a peg in a sure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house. And they will hang on him the whole weight of his father's house, the offspring and issue...\" Jesus knew Old Testament scripture better than anyone. He was making parallels between the keys of his heavenly kingdom and the way the keys were passed in the ancient kingdoms of Israel! Jesus would ascend his throne in heaven and leave Peter as his steward on earth (thus Peter's supremacy as Pastor does not contradict Christ's role as chief shepherd, rather Peter's supremacy comes from and is designated by Christ to rule the earthly Church once Christ was in heaven). All authority is committed to Peter's hand to rule over the household of his Father. \"None shall open what he shuts\"=none shall loose what he has bound and vice versa. He would become a throne of honor to the father but he does not detract from the Father. He has only the power granted to him by Christ but this power is much greater than Protestants pretend. \n \n Now consider also the significance of the pope speaking ex cathedra, that is \"from the chair.\" What chair and why is this chair so important? This chair is the chair of Moses. In Matthew 23  Jesus told his disciples to do what the Pharisees told them to do because they sat on the chair of Moses. \"Do what they tell you, but not what they do.\" Read Exodus 18  explaining the chair of Moses. It was the chair of judgement, the chair from which Moses instituted God's laws. Jesus put a new steward in the chair. As Moses was given his authority at Mount Sinai by God, Peter was given his at the mountain of Caesarea Philippi by Jesus. Moses had the power to judge, \"Moses sat to judge the people.\" He also had teaching authority, \"and you shall teach them the statutes and the decisions, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.\" Peter has these powers because he sits on the new chair of the Church. Moses spoke for God and Peter spoke for Jesus. \n \n Another clear example of Peter's primacy can be found in the Gospel of John, chapter 21: 15-19. Jesus' words here designate Peter as shepherd. Jesus again singles out Peter to lead the flock, in effect Jesus appoints Peter to be the chief shepherd. The Church did not appoint Peter shepherd, it only recognizes that Christ appointed him shepherd. The Church is obedient to Christ in accepting Peter. If one thinks that the designation of shepherd is not a designation of leadership then remember how often Christ referred to himself as the shepherd. \n \n Now, there is a volume of other evidence pointing toward Peter as prime minister that is more than coincidence, as I mentioned above. Although Peter was not the first to be called, after being called he always seemed to be first. In Matthew 10  he is listed first in the list of the apostles. The Greek word protos is used to designate him. This word means \"foremost,\" \"best,\" or \"chief.\" Peter's name is listed first in every scriptural listing of the apostles and sometimes they are referred to as \"Peter and the others.\" (Judas is always listed last). Peter's name is mentioned 195 times in the New Testament, more than all of the other apostles added together. The next closest is John at 34 times. Jesus chose Peter's boat from which to preach and work miracles. Peter is the only apostle to be personally prayed for by Jesus (Luke 22:31-32) and he tells Peter to \"strengthen his brethren.\" The risen Christ appeared first to Peter (Luke 24:34, 1 Corinthians 15:5) then the other apostles. Peter headed the meeting to replace Judas, he led the apostles in preaching on Pentecost and received the first converts, he performed the first pentecost miracle, inflicted the first punishment, excommunicated the first heretic, etc. The Church Fathers also testify to Peter's primacy.\n \n We must attempt to read scripture as the Jews would read it within the context of geography, Old Testament references, tradition, and history.\n\n \n Okay Judas was the only apostle called Jesus friend (Ill look it up but I saw it on a documentary so go figure), but there is no need to replace him. That's like God needing to appoint Jesus to replace Satan. Peter was an apostle there was no hierarchy. All you are saying is that Peter started a congregation and it got big. Because it got big it must be because Peter was more important. Even if I grant all your facts as true you are looking for more authority than Jesus gave.\n \n Mark 9:33-37 \n \n 33*And they came into Ca\u00b7per'na\u00b7um. Now when he was inside the house he put the question to them: \"What were YOU arguing over on the road?\" 34*They kept silent, for on the road they had argued among themselves who is greater. 35*So he sat down and called the twelve and said to them: \"If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and minister of all.\" 36*And he took a young child, stood it in their midst and put his arms around it and said to them: 37*\"Whoever receives one of such young children on the basis of my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives, not me only, but also him that sent me forth.\"\n \n Mark 10:41-45\n \n 41*Well, when the ten others heard about it, they started to be indignant at James and John. 42*But Jesus, after calling them to him, said to them: \"YOU know that those who appear to be ruling the nations lord it over them and their great ones wield authority over them. 43*This is not the way among YOU; but whoever wants to become great among YOU must be YOUR minister, 44*and whoever wants to be first among YOU must be the slave of all. 45*For even the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.\"\n \n \n BTW on heaven JWs take a head count of 7 million people and find only 8 thousand want to go to heaven. It is really simple. Jehovah's Witnesses really don't care for anything resembling an after life be it heaven or hell.",

The saint's reward will be no more than the sinner's if he repents. But to lead does not mean one isn't serving as well. Peter led the Church but he served it. He served it to the point of death/martyrdom. Jesus told us that there is no greater love than man give up his life for another. Peter gave his life for the Church, for the faithful. He served the Church in leadership. There was a hierarchy for the leading of the Church and it was instituted by Jesus. I can supply further testament to this by the words of the Church Fathers.\n \n \nBTW on heaven JWs take a head count of 7 million people and find only 8 thousand want to go to heaven.

   " I do believe that \"Matthew, Mark, Luke and John\" wrote the Gospels. I do not believe that Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were necessarily apostles. Matthew and John probably were.

Would he want to give a lot of exposure to one falsely claiming to be the Messiah(as the Jews believed)? Jesus was an important character but not necessarily one he wanted to talk about.\n\n Certainly. He gave tons of time describing horrible atrocities committed by Roman leaders against the Jews, accounts in detail of various rebels and troublemakers, etc. Josephus' purpose in writing the Antiquities seems to have been to chronicle as much as he could, and as a result his writings are vast on many subjects from the most mundane to the violently traumatic.

You actually believe that he would just leave out the virgin conception, but describe the birth as \"natural\"? There's nothing \"natural\" about a baby that is conceived through the \"Holy Spirit\", in fact it's the very definition of supernatural. Read the context of the sentence.

Jesus was a flop everybody. That's the irony of the gospel. Jesus was a necromancer, sorcerer and accused Satanist why would anyone like that make a historical impact? Nothing he said affected anyone on earth when he was saying it. Most things Jesus said was metaphysical, and the prediction he made about the Romans destroying Jerusalem was already expected by contemporaries to happen, and didn't happen until almost 40 years after Jesus died. The hand full of people that did remember Jesus from forty years ago left but then came back and got destroyed (considering this is were he died I guess he was not that memorable or credible). Only a minority of Jews that actually remembered left and never returned. I am sure this boosted Jesus credibility, but by the time Christianity took off from being your average cult the real players was dead. I mean look at Jehovah's Witnesses for example.\n \n Nobody cared about Jesus after his death outside of the few people that saw his apparition, and even they had stopped believing. That is why there was such an apostasy in the early Christian church. Most of the \"Christian\" doctrine was a myth not based on any fact.

   " Do you believe him to be an imaginary figure created by those wishing to start a religion?\n \n That seems to be where the evidence leads\n \n \nWhy?\n\n Because the evidence is overwhelmingly against the existance of a single notable person having lived between 7-40 CE named Yeshua who started a cult and was crucified for it. I didn't believe that the historical Jesus was the Son of God when I thought he did exist as a historical figure, I don't much care either way. Historically speaking, though, the evidence is against it.\n \n \nI was under the impression that the authorship of the Gospels was not widely debated. I thought that most scholars accepted the traditional evidence that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John wrote the Gospels. \n\n The \"titles\" of the Gospels were a later addition.\n \n \nIs there a contemporary of Jesus that denied his existence?\n\n Again, no contemporary of Jesus' had anything to say about him whatsoever. This doesn't necessarily mean he didn't exist at all, but it sure calls into question the whole story of him constantly \"attracting multiludes\", and pulling stunts like trashing the Temple. \n \n What makes me sceptical that he existed at all is actually Paul's writings. As he would have been Jesus' contemporary, and was in the same small area, and an up-and-coming Pharisee and Roman, I just don't think it's plausible that he would write about Jesus as he did.\n \n \nDo you believe John the Baptist was a real person?\n\n He is mentioned at length by Josephus, who also reports detailed descriptions of other wannabe Messiahs- Judas of Galilee, Theudas the Magician, etc. Josephus says more about John the Baptist than he does \"Jesus\" by far, if indeed any portion on the Testimonium are original.\n \n I have less information about him at hand, but I remember reading that he had quite a following who believed he was the Messiah, which is why his baptism of Christ was so important, despite the incongruousness of this mortal performing baptism on a demi-God. \n \n \nI was unaware that there were a vast number of \"scholars\" and historians at Jesus' time. \n\n Absolutely! This was the Roman Empire, meticulous records were kept. Certainly you understood that if there could be a story of Jesus wowing everyone with his knowledge of scripture then there had to be a body of knowledge, religious scholars, etc., within the Jewish people.\n \n \nCan you please supply chapter and verse of the scripture to which you refer so I can understand you more clearly? Is it Galatians 4:4?\n\n I'll get back to you on this...\n \n \nI am curious as to why Jesus was found in the temple as a boy, telling his parents that he must be in his \"Father's house.\" \"And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.\" Luke 2:41-51\n\n I said \"the early gospels\".",

   "The evidence I know of confirms a real person of Jesus. Of what evidence do you speak?\n\n Then please, put forward your evidence. I just haven't found any in all that I've seen on the subject. You said in your last reply to me-\nWho do you believe was the man named Jesus written about by non-Christian sources namely Josephus, Tacitus (these two you dispute, I know), Lucian, and Pliny the Younger? \n\n On Tacitus again, \"Where did Tacitus get his information about Jesus' execution? It is doubtful that he was quoting an official Roman document from the period because, as scholars are quick to point out, he mistakenly calls Pilate a procurator when he was actually a prefect.\n \n Perhaps Tacitus received it from his close friend Pliny the Younger, who may well have shared the knowledge he had acquired from contact with Christians in Asia Minor. But even if this is the case, the most we can say is that Tacitus is simply repeating what Christians of his day were saying about their origins. There is not much basis here for concluding that he was presenting independent testimony about the historical figure of Jesus.\" How do we know about Jesus? by Jim Herst\n \n As for Pliny and Lucian, they spoke only of the growing following that was Christianity in the era. To say that this is evidence of a historical Christ is equivalent to saying that a text describing the growth of Hiduism is evidence of the historical existence of Krishna and Kali.\n \n \nSo let's ask again the questions we posed at the beginning. Do these passages provide any real basis for a knowledge of Jesus as a historical figure? I think you will agree that the answer is \"No.\" More importantly, should we use these passages as a primary means by which we bolster our faith in Jesus of Nazareth? Again, I hope you would agree that the answer is an emphatic \"No!\"\n ibid, Jim Herst\n \n \nSo there is a contemporary of Jesus (along with Matthew and John) that wrote about him? \n\n Again, Matthew and John were not \"contemporaries of Jesus'. \n \n Paul wrote of a mystical and spiritual figure whom he encountered for the first time on the road to Damascus, during a time when he had been persecuting \"his followers\". He never specified that the Jesus he spoke of was supposed to have lived in Galilee during his lifetime. That is because Paul was describing a very different Christ than the Christ of the gospels- a spiritual figure, not a flesh-and-blood man.\n \n \nWhat is not plausible in Paul's writings that lead you to believe Jesus was not real? \n\n If he were a real person living in the time frame usually assumed, and doing or saying anything near what is described in the various gospel stories, it is improbable to impossible that Paul would not have encountered him himself. Also, all the points I raised in my earlier post are the other things in Paul's writings I find contradict the historicity theory- the things Paul seems to be unaware of in Jesus' gospel story and teachings.\n \n \nWhy would he write about an imaginary figure? \n\n I doubt he thought he was. He said he had a vision. He didn't say he was talking about someone who was alive last Tuesday.\n \n \nI was speaking of biblical scholarship accepting the traditional authors of scripture.\n\n Exactly. The original titles (\"according to\") implied that the author was writing \"as if\" they were an apostle- which was a common genre of religious writings of the day. \n \n \nDo you think that the Gospels were accurate in describing John the Baptist as a real person?\n\n I don't see why not, as other writers of the era (Josephus) wrote of him in a historical way. It seems the followers of John the Baptist were a threat to the early Christians, and his inclusion as a precursor to the Messiah was a tactic to include and convert his followers.\n \n \nWho are they and where are their historical writings? Have any of their writings survived?\n\n \nThat a man named Jesus, an obscure religious teacher, the basis of this fabulous Christ, lived in Palestine about nineteen hundred years ago, may be true. But of this man we know nothing. His biography has not been written. A Renan and others have attempted to write it, but have failed -- have failed because no materials for such a work exist. Contemporary writers have left us not one word concerning him. For generations afterward, outside of a few theological epistles, we find no mention of him.\n \n The following is a list of writers who lived and wrote during the time, or within a century after the time, that Christ is said to have lived and performed his wonderful works:\n \n \n Josephus\n Philo-Judaeus\n Seneca\n Pliny the Elder\n Suetonius\n Juvenal\n Martial\n Persius\n Plutarch\n Justus of Tiberius\n Apollonius\n Pliny the Younger\n Tacitus\n Quintilian\n Lucanus\n Epictetus\n Silius Italicus\n Statius\n Ptolemy\n Hermogones\n Valerius Maximus\n \n Arrian\n Petronius\n Dion Pruseus\n Paterculus\n Appian\n Theon of Smyrna\n Phlegon\n Pompon Mela\n Quintius Curtius\n Lucian\n Pausanias\n Valerius Flaccus\n Florus Lucius\n Favorinus\n Phaedrus\n Damis\n Aulus Gellius\n Columella\n Dio Chrysostom\n Lysias\n Appion of Alexandria\n \n \n Enough of the writings of the authors named in the foregoing list remains to form a library. Yet in this mass of Jewish and Pagan literature, aside from two forged passages in the works of a Jewish author, and two disputed passages in the works of Roman writers, there is to be found no mention of Jesus Christ.\n \n Philo was born before the beginning of the Christian era, and lived until long after the reputed death of Christ. He wrote an account of the Jews covering the entire time that Christ is said to have existed on earth. He was living in or near Jerusalem when Christ's miraculous birth and the Herodian massacre occurred. He was there when Christ made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. He was there when the crucifixion with its attendant earthquake, supernatural darkness, and resurrection of the dead took place -- when Christ himself rose from the dead, and in the presence of many witnesses ascended into heaven. These marvelous events which must have filled the world with amazement, had they really occurred, were unknown to him. It was Philo who developed the doctrine of the Logos, or Word, and although this Word incarnate dwelt in that very land and in the presence of multitudes revealed himself and demonstrated his divine powers, Philo saw it not.\n \n Josephus, the renowned Jewish historian, was a native of Judea. He was born in 37 A.D., and was a contemporary of the Apostles. He was, for a time, Governor of Galilee, the province in which Christ lived and taught. He traversed every part of this province and visited the places where but a generation before Christ had performed his prodigies. He resided in Cana, the very city in which Christ is said to have wrought his first miracle. He mentions every noted personage of Palestine and describes every important event which occurred there during the first seventy years of the Christian era. But Christ was of too little consequence and his deeds too trivial to merit a line from this historian's pen.\n \n Justus of Tiberius was a native of Christ's own country, Galilee. He wrote a history covering the time of Christ's reputed existence. This work has perished, but Photius, a Christian scholar and critic of the ninth century, who was acquainted with it, says: \"He makes not the least mention of the appearance of Christ, of what things happened to him, or of the wonderful works that he did\" (Photius' Bibliotheca, code 33).\n \n Judea, where occurred the miraculous beginning and marvelous ending of Christ's earthly career, was a Roman province, and all of Palestine is intimately associated with Roman history. But the Roman records of that age contain no mention of Christ and his works. The Greek writers of Greece and Alexandria who lived not far from Palestine and who were familiar with its events, are silent also.\nRemsberg The Christ, 1909",

What I value are the glories of Western Civilization, which Christiniaty had an important hand in achieving. The consequences of Christianity have overall been positive, so I want to see it thrive.

I, for one, don't like where they ended up with either of those gods.",

I believe that the Gospels are contradictory.\n\n I am not so sure it is necessarily a statement of faith, and not of reason. \n \n \nWell, anything is possible. There isn't sufficient evidence of either to pursuade me to become a believer.\n\n Is there more evidence of Jesus being a man or being an alien?\n \n \nMy beliefs do not require faith.
