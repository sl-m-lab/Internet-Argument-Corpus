   "who are the major players? whos good, who's bad? i'm looking for names of specific individuals, but if you only have organization names, thats great too.\n \n heres a few examples:\n \n the NPA geurillas of the philipines, along with abu Sayyaf (he has a $5 million dollar bounty on his head, if anyone's interested in collecting, please call the pentagon for briefing details :p )\n \n FARC chancellor of columbia Rodrigo Granda (captured now, but former chancellor)\n \n the ATM terrorists in france (supposed to be hiding in the caucuses)\n \n in afghanistan (how we love that place! :) ) there is taliban chief Mullahs Naqve and Qayum.\n \n does this give a clear example of what i'm looking for? i'm trying to figure out who the teutonic leaders are and who the puppets are, and i'm perfectly happy to share the results with anybody who asks.",

   "Ariel Sharon has directly orderend assults on Palestine and palestinian refuge camps, all leading to the death of innocent civilians. In the last four years the israelian army has killed more than 400 children in palestine. \n \n Blair, by the means of letting his army in Iraq and Kosovo use DU (depleted uranium) aminution, which certainly cause great harm to civilians in after time. DU is radioactive and when used as aminution it vaporise to be later breathed in as particals by civilians, which cause cancer and hidious mutations. DU is also a fatal poisonious heavy metal which runs into the drinking water, to later be drunk by civilians. Besides that their own soldiers operating and loading the amninution is harmed by it. \n \n I would belive Blair stands for many more war crimes too.",

   "Depleted uranium is entirely acceptable, because it allows a significantly reduced ammount of firepower to penetrate heavy armor: and i don't believe that it was used as extensively as you'd like to believe, for several reasons: one, uranium is expensive as all hell. with that in mind- and this should make you happy, since it keeps perfectly good soldiers from doing their jobs- commanders are VERY wary around anything expensive. why do you think we switched to the pea-shooter 5.56 milimeter gun? because a) it was cheap, and b) it wouldn't kill the enemy (only wound him). so depleted uranium- even in tank shells! was unlikely to be used extensively. second, its called DEPLETED for a good reason: its not potent. it doesn't hurt anything. depleted uranium has, from what i've seen, the same radioactive potential as granite: its still there, it still has a radioactive signature, but its not significant to do anything except in absolutely massive quantities, or with constant contact: aka, a kid is playing with a TANK SHELL. and at that point.. you have to ask yourself if that kid, by his own fault or the fault of his guardian, would live anyway: anybody who plays with explosives is likely to lose a few appendages: whether or not those are vital or not depends on his intelligence or care.\n \n another reason i don't think depleted uranium was used extensively is because the british have their own armor-piercing system: the use pierces by moving the armor out of the way, the british use something called 'squash-head' ammunition: the shell literally deforms on impact, forcing the metal of the armor into the interior of the tank or apc.\n \n as for yassir arafat, what would you prefer? some islamic power-hungry dumbass who would start 'ethnically cleansing' all the jews? if you want to compare two evils, arafat starts to look VERY appealing.\n \n and thank you for the force 4 information, lord tammerlain",

   "I DU aminution is not harmful to futher extent than granite, i find it funny how many people it acctually kills, deform and wounds. The particals created of DU when used is harmful, because you breath it in, or drink it. DU is strong beta emitter and is documentated (not by usa nor britain but by neutral nations who don't use it) to cause a much MUCH higher rate of cancer and misformed children. \n DU aminution is cheap, being a very practial way of disposing the waste product of nuclear power plants. I or the people of the nations who use it would never find it ok to breath in the dust of nuclear waste. DU is concidered illegal to pocess in those countries too, being a material of great danger and usefull for terrorism. \n DU amunition is the only alternative for the american main battle tank. And it has been used significant in the gulf war, Kosovo and Iraq II. Both by britain and th US. \n Approximately 200 metric tons of DU during combat in Iraq 2003, much of this expenditure appears to have been in or near urban areas,\n where the Iraqi people live, work, draw water, and grow and sell food.",
