   "This seems to be a very interesting debate.\n I agree with the point of rape being a byproduct of sexual dimorphism. All creatures exist in power struggles with their respective peers. This is expressed in many examples from rabbits competing for mates and burrows, to humans competing in schools and places of employment. Rape is an expression of power and dominance. \n Im not sure about the evolutionary adaptation point though. Could someone please enlighten me as to what that means.",

   "Responding from a Christian perspective...\n \n I think rape is a product if sexual dimorphism. Both the Genesis 1 & 2 account of creation (there are actually two accounts and not exactly the same), the image of God upon which man (humankind) was formed seems to unequivocably suggest that there was not supposed to be a concept of mankind as being \"male or female\" but rather, \"male and female\". This seems to be a holistic concept by the Creator God where humankind could not be defined as either but only together - as equal and co-dependent parts of a whole. There is no implication of subordination between sexes and the name \"Eve\" did not even exist until after humankind fell. Before that, humans, male and femae, were simply known as \"adam' which is simply means human or \"man\" in a non-gendered way. It is only as a result of sin that we see mankind being looked upon as two distinct poles where power becomes an issue. The implication is males would hold physical power over females as a result of sin. It is only after the fall that male-female relations are looked as being binary - two seperate entities together, instead of equal parts that make a singel whole. Hence, Eve is named after the fall.\n \n From everything I have heard, read, watched about rape, it seems the overwhelming perspective is that rape is about power and how someone might attain control and power over a person by using physical and psychological advantage to overcome someone. So I think rape is a product of a divided humankind, clearly defined and divided by sexuality as a result of sin.\n \n As a Christian, and as someone who believes the life came into existence at the hands of a Creator God (and not to refute the concept of evolution as possibly being an inherhent dynamic of life) I would suggest that perhaps characteristics such as rape seem to be indicative of a development or evolution that happens against God's ideal and is also a case for validating evolution as a part of life. In case that did not make sense...\n \n I am going to boldly state that rape was not part of God's ideal plan for humanity. But since humanity fell, one of its developments - one way in which humanity might have evolved - is towards a sociology where power is often used to subordinate others. It was not, as I see, a creation of God but a development of fallen man.\n \n -peace",
