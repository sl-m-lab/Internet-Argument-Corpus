   "God Loves the Sinners, Hates the City (other than the gay part)\n \n Anti-gay activist group, Repent America, has claimed that God destroyed New Orleans because it welcomes gay visitors. A few choice selections from its press release include:\n \n \"Southern Decadence\" has a history of filling the French Quarters section of the city with drunken homosexuals engaging in sex acts in the public streets and bars. Last year, a local pastor sent video footage of sex acts being performed in front of police to the mayor, city council, and the media. City officials simply ignored the footage and continued to welcome and praise the weeklong celebration as being an \"exciting event\". However, Hurricane Katrina has put an end to the annual celebration of sin.\n \n And\n \n \"Although the loss of lives is deeply saddening, this act of God destroyed a wicked city,\" stated Repent America director Michael Marcavage.\n \n If this group sounds familiar, they are the same group who held up banner declaring homosexuality to be sin at a day designated by the Philadelphia Phillies for gay fans to come to the park. They also attend gay events with bullhorns to drown out the entertainment with anti-gay slogans.\n \n Ironically, they may have misheard what God was saying with this storm. Had they listened closer they might have realized that the part of the city with the least damage was the French Quarter and that so far most of the deaths have been in Mississippi (not a state famous for it gay excesses).\n \n Had God been truly trying to make a point about The Gays, he could have just skipped the South altogether and send a tornado after wedding chapels in Massachusetts. But, then again, maybe God finds gay people much more to his liking than bigots.\n \n I don't like to be glib about a natural disaster that has shattered thousands of lives and killed hundreds. But it seems important to point out that there is a growing trend - from Fred Phelps to Pat Robertson and all the anti-gays inbetween - to blame every disaster on The Homosexual Agenda. And the irony is that God seems determined to prove them wrong.\n http://www.exgaywatch.com/blog/index.html",

He starts by pointing out certain anti-gay people who blame gays for natural disasters, then he follows it up by asking how that could be true when natural disasters seem to have been striking anti-gays heavily.\n \n You can tell this right away, here is a quote from the article:\n \n \"There was a lot that happened in the aftermath of 9/11. People began to ask, Why? And then Jerry Falwell told them, the answer was obvious. It was the fault of abortionists and gay people. Well, of course it was. After all, so many of the 19 terrorists were gay-not! \n \n I sat back and listened. Soon, with just a little research, I found that Falwell was indeed cracked but not alone. Gay people have been blamed for hurricanes destroying coastlines, for earthquakes-in fact, for almost every major disaster, it would appear.\"\n \n And what about his claim that:\n \n \"God obviously hates Florida. This year alone, nature, and thus, under many beliefs, God, has sent storms early and fast right into the peninsula that has caused so many problems.\"\n \n Of course the author doesn't actually think God hates Florida; his point is that natural disasters are caused by the weather and nothing more.",
