Many are becoming critical of his new ad (over 60% in a CNN pole) which includes pictures from 9/11 which I can sort of understand but it still surprises me.

   "I don't want to be one of those that is panicky because of what the polls show at this time. Afterall, recent history has shown that incumbents are behind around this time (Dole was ahead of Clinton for example) but have for the most part still won re-election. And, Bush has been busy running a country and hasn't known who is opponent will be until recently, so he hasn't been \"fighting back\". Let's face it, using the logic of people that believe these polls, the U.S. lost WWII on December 8, 1941. It is my belief however that Conservatives have character and Liberals don't. I haven't researched this, but it's probably a safe bet that these Third party candidates do more damage to Republicans than Democrats. Conservatives are more likely to cut their noses off to spite their faces-casting a vote of conscience even if it IS a \"wasted\" vote. I believe that if Hitler had a (D) next to his name, Liberals would vote for him because they just want their guy to win, no matter who it may be (think about it, fiscally, Bush is more Liberal than a Liberal but that (R) gets in the way). So, the \"hate Bush\" crowd will be out in force, blindly believing once again that it just can't be any worse than it is now. Obviously, it will be 2000 all over again, very close. Don't be surprised if the Democrats once again come up with voting \"problems\".",

Kerry and the Democrats have politicized all sorts of things, but when THEY say it they claim it is their job to point things out.
