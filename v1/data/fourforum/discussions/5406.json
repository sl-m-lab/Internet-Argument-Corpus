   "Science Made Easy\n by MikeGene \n Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection has been a little too fruitful lately. A couple years back, Randy Thornhill and Craig Palmer argued that rape is an adaptation. When evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne criticized their thesis, Thornhill labeled him as an \"anti-evolution critic.\"\n \n Well, there is a new discovery on the block. This time, evolutionary psychologist David Buss, from the University of Texas, argues that murder is also an adaptation.\n \n \n Murder could be traced back to the \"ruthless evolutionary drive to reproduce\", he said.\n \n Thousands of years ago killing an enemy would boost a man's social status and improve his chances of attracting a mate, the book argued.\n \n Murderers' genes won the evolutionary battle over those of their victims and the instinct to kill now lies dormant in all of us, Prof Buss argued.\n \n \n I don't want to comment on Buss's argument as I have not read the book. Nevertheless, since it is so easy to create a new field of scientific exploration about human behavior using Darwin's theory, I am inspired to try my hand at it.\n \n \n Let me propose the shoe fetish as an evolutionary adaptation. We'll define a shoe fetish as follows: a person, usually male, can only become sexually aroused when shoes are involved in the sexual act. Mind you, I'm not an expert on the shoe fetish, so my definition may be inaccurate. But that need not stop me from doing a little evolutionary psychology here.\n \n Okay, here's the hypothesis I pulled out of my rear. Long ago, some females began to wear primordial shoes. The newly evolved shoe-wearing gene was selected for, as females with leather booties were less likely to cut their feet and acquire a deadly infection. This prolonged lifespan set up a selective pressure to develop a shoe fetish among males. Males who became attracted to the booties would be at an advantage, as they would more likely impregnate the bootie women who in turn would be more likely to survive to take care of their sperm products.\n \n Can we test the hypothesis? Absolutely.\n \n First, let's conduct some scientific interviews with men who have a shoe fetish. Did they just wake up one day and decide to have this fetish? Or has it always been part of their sexual identity? My evolutionary psychology hypothesis predicts the latter.\n \n Next, let's look for genetic markers. Are men with a shoe fetish more likely to have a particular marker? If so, perhaps we can begin looking for the shoe-fetish gene(s).\n \n What about females? My personal anecdotal experience has allowed me to cross paths with females who have far more shoes than I do. Is this a fairly widespread phenomenon? Is this an adaptation? Is there a shoe-collecting gene that is the descendent of the original primordial shoe-wearing gene?",

   "Following Mike Gene's lead I'm sure a molecular phylogeny will be found tracing the evolution of shoe fetish from foot fetish, from fin fetish, all the way back to pseudopod fetish.\n \n I am working out the density dependent selection effects, and will be entertaining working models of shoe fetish as evolutionary atavism or vestigial trait. Possibly due to a recurrent random mutation.\n \n A game theortic approach also suggests itself, but will be restricted to athletic shoes. \n \n Hopefully the field Mike Gene has single-handedly invented will evolve into a generalized evolutionary theory of peccadilloes. Something we have been sorely lacking until his ground-breaking research.\n \n (I hesitate to introduce topics in the subbasement because I know the \"alleged humorists\" often wield their witty rapiers against interlopers like a farmer wields his thresher. But its been suspiciously quiet down here lately. Whenever you guys grow silent I start to worry. I knew that such a peculiar bunch couldn't resist adding to a theory of peculiarities.

Depression, for example, is seen as a trait favored by natural selection to enable us to solve our problems by withdrawing, reflecting, and hence enhancing our future reproduction. Plausible? Maybe.
