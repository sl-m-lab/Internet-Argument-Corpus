Surely thats opening them to ridicule and cast doubt on there writings.\n\n \n Your questions are valid. As to the question of who's right and who's wrong, I would not look at the organization. Jesus did not come for organizations but for individuals. On an individual basis Jesus said \"By this all men will know you are my disciples, that you love one another.\" The love he is speaking of is not affection. It is not a feeling. It is how they act toward one another and the people around them. Many proclaim christ with their mouths and not with their lives. JW's often lead very secluded lives and do not wish to associate with anyone who will not accept their beliefs. Many christians are the same way. The book of Romans says that God will write his law on our hearts. Find the people who love well and live well in community. Then talk to them and get to know them. That is how you can tell who is right. The right will have their lives match up with what they believe.\n \n One other thing on this. The issue of community is important. Do people always look good or are they willing to show you their faults and ask forgiveness and be vulnerable to others. One may simply look good. I am always wary of a person that will not let me see when they make mistakes. This is also a mark of a good parent. Children that see their parents err and then handle it correctly grow up to be merciful and gracious.\n \n As for the Miracles, as I said, the writers were not trying to convince anyone. The wrote what they did as the Spirit of God lead them to write it. The time has not come yet when the miraculous is to be that obvious. Just as Jesus has not returned. The time is coming, when I don't know. I think that is probably significant. I also think that the changed heart of a person is a far greater accomplishment than the moving of a mountain.",

   "Which begs the question, did the writers on purposely indicate the happenings of miracles as a way to \"boost\" the appeal of the bible?\n\n plotter, whether it was purposeful or not is both irrelevant and beyond our finding out. the fact is that Jesus himself performed miracles daily, according to all the gospels. whether those accounts are true or not is also beyond our finding out. all we have to work with are the written accounts of Matthew.

Less of an interpretation. There are many who are older and wiser who have studied and understand some fundamental beliefs and fundamental principles. I trust them to lead me. Why? Because I have seen their lives. They live up to what they say. One man, a very dear friend about 30 years my senior, says that God is a God of love and cares for and takes care of him.

I watch others. I see if what they say lines up with what they believe. People who appear to be all good and no bad, I highly question. Just because no one is really that way. The people I see who live good lives also do not hide their shortcomings. They admit them, they are willing to allow others to have input into their lives. This input is not just opinions. They are actually accountable for their shortcomings to others. The fact that they trust God ultimately, allows them to trust, flawed others. Because their trust is not in the other, not really. It is in God. \n \n I was reading a book called \"renovation of the heart\" and there is a line in there that says, in effect, that if I trust God, the creator of the universe, the one who is control of all things, and that he really will bring about everything for my good, even tragic circumstances, then I REALLY have NOTHING to fear. NOthing!\n \n That is the reason I believe what I believe and why I trust those that I do.",

I unfortunately don't have a real good answer except that it is one of the items that is accepted on faith.\n \n We put our faith in lots of other items. I have chosen this one to live my life by. I have seen those that live joyful content lives that are not ruled by their circumstances. They have difficult circumstances as does everyone, but they don't live on an emotional roller coaster. Those folks, live by this book. \n \n As for Jesus, Either he was a really good guy that was a lunatic or he was who he claimed to be. He claimed to be God. There are those that will argue this and I do not wish to debate them here. It is being done on other threads. I would suggest reading through several of the threads. Plotter and I have had many discussions on the issue. As have many others. Read through and see what you see. Decide for yourself, but don't assume that God does not exist. Assume you don't know and then look around. Look for the proof in the pudding. Best answer I can give.",
