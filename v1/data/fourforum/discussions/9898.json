   "Why must we be subjected to such shallow drivel in the guise of actual commentary ? The sole and complete reason why the secular humanist would accuse the Christians love of being conditional is because they have no concept of what TRUE love is. To the humanist true love is total acceptance of what others do and simply put, is defined as universal tolerance for sinful acts and lifestyles no matter what they entail.\n \n To the Christian, love is honestly correcting and sharing the truth, not according to the christians personal moral code but according to Gods moral code as defined in His Word. To the humanist, beastiality is a personal choice and their idea of love is universally tolerating this activity in others no matter how detrimental the lifestyle might be on their civilization in the long run. The same tolerance could be applied for incest, pedophelia, homosexuality and all forms of abhorant sexual perversions.\n \n You see, humanists never deal with or consider what is actually true, good, or edifying for humanity, but only what feels good and is within the realm of our imaginings. So if it can be imagined, and some are attracted to it in practice, then surely it is loving to accept those who practice whatever they can imagine to be pleasurable, no matter how sick, perverted or damaging it is in the long run to those participating in it. Under these circumstances, Christians, who insist on standing against such willful perversions are seen as having conditional love rather than the love to honestly assess, define and correct those within their Society of the harms of such practices if they are practiced unchecked.\n \n So once again, the rantings and diatribes of the humanist is nothing more than a mysoganistic excercise in defamation of Christians who actually show their love for others by telling them the truth based on a real moral compass rather than accepting peoples blatant sins as tolerance which in the end leads the people humanists claim to love to personal destruction. So I ask you, how is what jackamarra describes above in support of humanists, really and truly LOVE ? Shame on you jackamarra, lying about christians again. emoticon_xangel",

Kicking the gays out of the priesthood is a ruse for solving the real problem. A lot easier and CHEAPER, too. It's the homos that caused this problem, not a corrupt hierarchy that refused to do the right thing and boot the abusers after reporting them to the police. This gives the appearance that they are actually doing something about the problem. There are a lot of gay priests. (There are a lot a gay priest offenders as well, of course. I am not saying otherwise.) When the number of applicants for the priesthood continues to dwindle, I would bet they are not going to try very hard to weed out the gays.

   "CONDITIONAL CHRISTIAN LOVE\n Given that a fervent segment of the current audience in this philosophy forum is spreading and defending the 'word' then the following is posted for their philosophical 'enlightenment'.\n \n 1.

How ethical is conditional Christian love, when this tainted love is contrasted with the pure love of unconditional humanism?\n \n 2.

There are no strings attached, this love is not underwritten by dubious gospels and myths.\n \n 5. Christian conditional love is therefore logically negated, if not corrupted by its own messianic incentives. Loving mankind through a god, is damaged as this not only demonstrates the incapacity of the believer to love authentically, it reveals the selfish motive of the Christian who supposes the 'love'.\n\n \n 1. Christianity makes no such claims. Christians claim only to be fallible due to their humanity and seek forgiveness and pray for wisdom and strength to become better people. Christians love naturally, and hate naturally, instructed by Christ to struggle to overcome ill feelings and forgive and love those who trespass against them. And often fail. \n 2. If this is your understanding, then you do not understand. \n 3. Utterly false. Christians have the exact same feelings and emotions as any human of any creed. \n 4. Neither Paolo Freire, nor yourself can offer one shred of evidence of this unconditional love excuded by humanist other than the proclamation itself. \n Which apparently is not available to Christians.\n Please feel free to present examples of relief or aid movements by organizations labeled humanist.",

She has done nothing since being here but spew hatred for christians and God, yet she wants to delude herself and lie to us by implying that as a humanist her love is unconditional, and superior to that of a christians capacity to love. Jackamarra just shows how easilly self deluded humanists are to believe that what she feels for me as a fellow human being could actually be defined as unconditional love. \n \n Well, as a believer in Christ and a recipient of His Holy Spirit, I don't claim to be capable of unconditional love. I don't believe any human being is capable of it. But the Holy Spirit which indwells all believers is very capable of it, which is how I feel empathy, sympathy, concern, compassion and love for people who have beliefs and lifestyles I truly hate. It is not I, but Christ in me who loves all people. An unconditional love is a supernatural love so no person possesses it in and of themselves.",

As ye have indicated, love can only be authentic if it is unconditional. Now, it is my thesis (which I would have ye attack) that no exchange made between any two individuals (humanist or no) can ever be truly unconditional and therefore may not represent authentic love. Humans are economists at heart, not philosophers. Humans base their decisions on the cost/benefits scale. Whereas the Christian may act entirely as ye claim, the humanist merely substitutes society for God in the exchange of goods for services. \n \n Ye make the claim that there is no ulterior motive, no threat or reward compelling the humanist to love humanity. This is an interesting concept. According to your model, there would be no exchange and therefore, no cost/benefit calculation which is key to my theory. I wonder, how would you gauge the level of love the humanist bears for humanity? How is unconditional love expressed? You make an interesting notion that love may be expressed irrespective of acts. If love may indeed be manifest without works then how is that love measured? Unconditional love unexpressed through acts is rather like the proverbial tree that falls in the middle of the woods.

   "[B]Well met. Expound, if ye will on that concept of unconditional love by the humanist. As ye have indicated, love can only be authentic if it is unconditional. Now, it is my thesis (which I would have ye attack) that no exchange made between any two individuals (humanist or no) can ever be truly unconditional and therefore may not represent authentic love. Humans are economists at heart, not philosophers. Humans base their decisions on the cost/benefits scale. Whereas the Christian may act entirely as ye claim, the humanist merely substitutes society for God in the exchange of goods for services.\n \n \n I don't entirely disagree with these points, but the distinction needs to be reiterated between a selfless love for humanity as opposed to a selfish love for individuals. Humanity is larger than the individual, it cannot be bargained with, and no goods can be \"trucked\" between the 2 parties, i.e. humanist and humanity. So your point of economic rationalism does not fit in this instance, as it (e.r.) does not in many other human endeavors. \n \n \n[B]Ye make the claim that there is no ulterior motive, no threat or reward compelling the humanist to love humanity. This is an interesting concept. According to your model, there would be no exchange and therefore, no cost/benefit calculation which is key to my theory. I wonder, how would you gauge the level of love the humanist bears for humanity? \n \n \n Grading the level of unconditional love is illogical - it is either or, it's an absolute concept, a bit like death.\n \n \n[B]How is unconditional love expressed? You make an interesting notion that love may be expressed irrespective of acts. If love may indeed be manifest without works then how is that love measured? Unconditional love unexpressed through acts is rather like the proverbial tree that falls in the middle of the woods. If you love unconditionally in the middle of the woods and no one is around, are ye actually loving at all? \n\n \n This positivistic approach to a love of humanity misses the point, as outlined above, but if we agree that the nearest or best example of unconditional love is that shared between a parent and child, then this benchmark could then be applied to the idea of an unconditional love for humanity. How to \"measure\" the actuality of unconditional love as opposed to your requested \"levels\" is beyond the ambit of my claim against conditional christian 'love', although you may think otherwise.",

Billy Crystal notwithstanding, an individual is either dead or they are alive and there are criteria to determine same: Does the individual have a pulse, do the pupils dilate, is the individual room temperature, did the individual vote for a democrat in Chicago, etc. Like death, ye have criteria to measure unconditional love. Does the love have conditions? If it does, it is not unconditional, so there it is. \n \n This positivistic approach to a love of humanity misses the point, as outlined above, but if we agree that the nearest or best example of unconditional love is that shared between a parent and child, then this benchmark could then be applied to the idea of an unconditional love for humanity. How to \"measure\" the actuality of unconditional love as opposed to your requested \"levels\" is beyond the ambit of my claim against conditional christian 'love', although you may think otherwise.\n \n You made the argument that Humanism is better than Christianity because the love of the Humanist is unconditional. You now admit that ye cannot establish what unconditional love is. What then is the difference between the Christian who points to a God he cannot substantiate and the humanist who points to an unconditional love he cannot substantiate? I find ye rather similar to that Christian ye seem to deride, you just have a different name for your abstract concept.\n \n Ye are the professed humanist! Do not blame positivism for your inability to define and demonstrate unconditional love. How can ye so quickly toss aside positivism? If ye Nietzsche me I will Comte ye. Ye, in the affirmative have the unfortunate burden of establishing what unconditional love is while I may sit back in my comfortable negative chair and snipe at ye. All I need do is establish one condition and your unconditional love scenario falls. \n \n Just to be completely disagreeable, I challenge your notion that the love between a parent and child is absolutely unconditional. The way I see it, and Plato agrees with me, the love of parent for the child springs from the natural desire for immortality. With that desire come a number of conscious and/or unconscious conditions. \n \n This desire of immortality springs from the notion of perpetual possession as vocalized by Socrates in The Symposium. To love that which is beautiful generates a desire to create the beautiful. Thus, love must by its very nature be the love of immortality as well as of the Beautiful. Socrates holds that love is associated with the reproduction of the species. This desire to reproduce is our best hope of achieving perpetuity. The parent loves the child because through them we all may partake of the future. \n \n If, as ye state, the love of the parent for the child is truly unconditional, how do ye reconcile the punishment that parent may mete out on that child that does not behave in accordance with the will of the parent? How does that punishment differ from the Christian who through acts or law, seeks to address the behavior of the individual who does not act in accordance with their will or the will o' God (The Celestial Parent if ye will)? How does the parent/child relationship differ from the God/Christian relationship in terms of conditional love? Are love and punishment mutually exclusive? Can the child authentically love the parent or is that child's behavior?",

   "CONDITIONAL CHRISTIAN LOVE\n Given that a fervent segment of the current audience in this philosophy forum is spreading and defending the 'word' then the following is posted for their philosophical 'enlightenment'.\n \n A cardinal claim by contemporary Christians is a professed love for Mankind. Superficially, this seems to be a noble value of Christianity, but how authentic is this dazzling 'love'. How ethical is conditional Christian love, when this tainted love is contrasted with the pure love of unconditional humanism?\n \n As I understand Christianity, love is tied to a bigger love for god, and to obediently love god, the Christian is compelled to profess a love for Mankind. This suggests the typical Christian loves Mankind because he is instructed to do so, and would not do so if he was not so directed. \n \n Love to the Christian does not come naturally; it is coerced by threats and promises echoed by the church throughout the centuries. \n \n Then consider humanists, such as Paolo Freire, who advocate an unconditional love for Mankind based on a shared humanity. There are no strings attached, this love is not underwritten by dubious gospels and myths.\n \n Christian conditional love is therefore logically negated, if not corrupted by its own messianic incentives. Loving mankind through a god, is damaged as this not only demonstrates the incapacity of the believer to love authentically, it reveals the selfish motive of the Christian who supposes the 'love'.\n\n \n I do not think this is christian love. You make a claim about christianity that is patently false. It does not love because it is \"instructed\" to do so. Instead the love comes as a natural consequence of God loving them. One does not love because they have to. That, by definition, is not love.\n \n Love comes only after receiving love. The christian doctrine, as I understand it, is that because God loved man, man CAN love others. Secular humanism is actually very conditional. It says that I love only in order to \"feel good\" abotu things. That is precisely loving for the purpose of getting something and is very selfish.\n \n The chirstian doctrine says not that a person \"should\" love others but rather if one has received the love of God then one WILL love others. It is simply a natural outflowing of what has already been received. It is the only way love really can be unconditional.\n \n Personally, I have trouble with the whole concept of love. It certainly sounds nice, but has always been pie in the sky thinking to me. But, you misreperesent the doctrine in order to make your own point. This is just bad commentary.\n \n Huck",

They will also see clearly that it was they who rejected Him and not the other way around.

   " I understand your logic,. but where is it stated that God's love in unconditional?\n JOhn 3:16 Eph 2:4, Eph 5:2, 2thes2:16, 1John 4:10-11, Rom 5:8, Rom 8:39, 2Cor 13:11 and 14, Eph 3:19, 2thes 3:5, and many more. These are all only new testament references. I can take you through others if necessary. There is Titus 3:4 where the word is not Agape but is philabnthropia.

The point is that man is supposed to love unconditionally but cannot and does not without the help of God. Reread those passages in context and you will see it more completely. Correct that fitting does not give meaning but then the article does not rightly use proper translational principles in determining the meaning of the passages as the equivocate terms.\n \n \n \n I've Studied German, Russian and French myself. There is no 'unconditional' to a fathers love. Many instances there are conditions that may not be appent that later negates that love.\n I would say deep, abiding love. A pure love or even without reason.\n\n \n NO human love is absolutely unconditional. The unconditionality is placed on the subject and not the object. In others words, God loves because God is love.

The death of an unrepentant sinner who is then judged and flung away from God (into the lake of fire) where they are forgotten and not lamented (there is no sorrow in heaven IIRC in some verses).\n God's love does not end. YOu have the time frame wrong in your analysis. It is not that the person dies and then is judged and then flung away. It is that the person is judged already when sin enters them. Sin was judged at the cross for all time (forwards and backwards, remember that God exists outside of time ie he is eternal). The issue is that since a person is already judged they may choose another course. God does not force that course upon them. He does not force you or I to choose him. Would you want to be forced into a marriage that you did not choose? Do you actually want God to force you to spend eternity with him when you do not like him? That is the logic and doctrine as I have been taught from a christian friend of mine. This was a bit beyond me so I looked for some help. I think I understand it well enough to respond though.\n \n \n I have no problems with the concept of unconditional love.\n I don't believe many humans could achieve this.\n I do have a problem with the notion that god's love is so as there are conditions placed and it does end at a certain point (which is a condition). \n\n \n \n The fact that humans can conceive of unconditional love certainly says something for its potential as a concept. While I do not think that conceiving of one eyed unicorns means they exist, when speaking of concepts I think there is something about the ability to \"conceptualize\" it DOES say something for its potential to exist.\n \n Just my thoughts.\n \n Huck",

   "You say man can't love unconditionally yet man is the one who used the word Agape. And applied it to others (not just God's type of love).\n \n From definitions, I find it means an awe inspiring type of love. A spirtual style of love. \n The example of my love for my son (whom I'd place higher than any god real or imagined) is one that fills me with wonder and adoration.\n Such is still not 'unconditional.'\n \n In many of the bibles I don't find the word 'unconditional' used.\n \n It's a concept I believe that was erroniously applied after the fact and in spite of scriptural evidence to the contrary. Making the word mean more than it does.\n \n As for the non-linear nature of God (outside time) I would state that too and thanks for the reminder. \n As for force, I'd say if it's in my best interest, why not?\n Surely actually knowing the love God has and being in His presence would cover for that little error. True love does things that aren't 'nice' at times.\n As it stands, I see no reason to remove this sin concept thing I was BORN with, and later felt necessary to add on to.\n \n Personally, I would say God is Justice. That which is right. That's how you get the sinner unloved. How Just would it be if God accepted all unconditionally? I wouldn't feel that special for diing right when I get the same reward as those who do wrong. \n No, He does not abide sin and it must be furthest from him.

It is absolutely true that Atheists have proven that anything is permissable to them throughout history by the number of dead instigaters and dissenters they have nurdered throughout the history of this World. Mao, Stallin, Lenin, Pol-Pot, Hitler and Idi Amin come to mind. And they all lived in the 20th Century alone. Imagine the uncountable number of dead if we inventoried the human destruction left in the wake of the amoral athiests who have been placed in positions of authority since the beginning of human existence. \n \n You see, when anything is permissable, and because there is no God, then life has no value at all so the mass killing of human beings is just no big deal. So congratulations for being about as deep as a puddle of puppy pee. And endorsing the mentality that supports mass murder, chaos, anarchy and every other self serving act of hedonism and mysoganistic lifestyles conceived in the mind of man.",

   "\n But Nietzsche turned his back on the unknown one. He became one of the most significant critics of religion in general, and Christianity in particular. Nietzsche is famous for having invented the phrase \"God is dead.\" \n\n \n WOW jack, you must be proud to expound the morals and values of some of histories most despicable Philosophers. But just using their german names makes one sound so intelligent so you can't help it huh ? So you support and even embrace the philosophy that National Socialism and the holocaust grew out of. A philosophy that a self described immoralist and anti-christ promoted ? Why does this not surprise me at all. But thanks for defining exactly what you stand for, for all to plainly see.\n \n \nFriedrich Nietzsche (e.g. in Thus Spoke Zarathustra):\n Nietzsche, the self-described \"Immoralist\" and \"Anti-Christ,\" rejects moral discourse, rational moral principles, and indeed morality altogether. Thus, in the 1886 preface to the early Birth of Tragedy (1872), Nietzsche says that \"it already prefigured that spirit of deep distrust and defiance which, later on, was to resist to the bitter end any moral interpretation of existence whatsoever\" [Golffing translation, Anchor edition, 1956, p.10]. He continued, \"Morality, on this view, became a mere fabrication for purposes of gulling: at best, an artistic fiction; at worse, and outrageous imposture\" [ibid.]. There we get the denial and dismissal of morality, here we get the aestheticism: \"I claimed that art, rather than ethics, constituted the essential metaphysical activity of man, while in the body of the book I made several suggestive statements to the effect that existence could be justified only in esthetic terms\" [p.9]. Traditional morality, a conspiracy of the Jews (yes, he says that), is for \"slaves\" who are unable or unwilling to seize the power that they want. The (aesthetic) ideal is the \u00dcbermensch (Superman or Overman), who is beyond good and evil, who acts on his Will to Power, and who is completely indifferent to the needs, rights, and claims, or existence, of other persons. Grassian presents this as a disagreement over the nature of morality, but it is really a disagreement over whether morality, in any recognizable sense, even exists. An imaginative conception of beings who are morally rather like Nietzsche's \u00dcbermenschen may be found in the horror fiction of H.P. Lovecraft: \n \n The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and reveling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. [\"The Call of Cthulhu,\" boldface added]\n Since Lovecraft believed in an amoral universe, and knew Nietzsche, it is not hard to see where this came from. Although \"The Call of Cthulhu\" was written in 1926, and Lovecraft's use of \"holocaust\" is in its etymological sense of burning, his use of the term does frighteningly foreshadow the true later Holocaust, a genuine event of killing, \"beyond good and evil,\" with \"laws and morals thrown aside\" -- an ecstasy of freedom for the Nazis. \n \n",

Sisyphus was a pathetic character who was punished in the underworld for his escapades of betraying the gods. \n \n \nThe gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.\n \n If one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the wisest and most prudent of mortals. According to another tradition, however, he was disposed to practice the profession of highwayman. I see no contradiction in this. Opinions differ as to the reasons why he became the futile laborer of the underworld. To begin with, he is accused of a certain levity in regard to the gods. He stole their secrets. Aegina, the daughter of Aesopus, was carried off by Jupiter. The father was shocked by that disappearance and complained to Sisyphus. He, who knew of the abduction, offered to tell about it on condition that Aesopus would give water to the citadel of Corinth. To the celestial thunderbolts he preferred the benediction of water. He was punished for this in the underworld. Homer tells us also that Sisyphus had put Death in chains. Pluto could not endure the sight of his deserted, silent empire. He dispatched the god of war, who liberated Death from the hands of the conqueror.\n \n It is said also that Sisyphus, being near to death, rashly wanted to test his wife's love. He ordered her to cast his unburied body into the middle of the public square. Sisyphus woke up in the underworld. And there, annoyed by an obedience so contrary to human love, he obtained from Pluto permission to return to earth in order to chastise his wife. But when he had seen again the face of this world, enjoyed water and sun, warm stones and the sea, he no longer wanted to go back to the infernal darkness. Recalls, signs of anger, warnings were of no avail. Many years more he lived facing the curve of the gulf, the sparkling sea, and the smiles of the earth. A decree of the gods was necessary. Mercury came and seized the impudent man by the collar and, snatching him from his joys, led him forcibly back to the underworld, where his rock was ready for him.\n \n You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is,as much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth. Nothing is told us about Sisyphus in the underworld. Myths are made for the imagination to breathe life into them. As for this myth, one sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone, the shoulder bracing the clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the fresh start with arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted hands. At the very end of his long effort measured by skyless space and time without depth, the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down in a few moments toward that lower world whence he will have to push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the plain. It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the hour of consciousness. \n \n",

   "\"When god is dead\" writes Dostoyevsky, \"anything is permissible.\"\nSpoken like a true Christian. I'd say an advanced stage of Hobbesianism.\n \n When one is obliged to believe that the only thing keeping humanity from doing evil is the fear of punishment, real punishment or imagined punishment from an imaginary punishing deity, one seems unable to ever escape from that very narrow belief that all goodness resides outside of evil humanity.\n \n I believe that humans are innately good. I don't know that they were, originally, hard-wired to be good, rather I believe that morality and \"good\" or \"goodness\" as defined through the ages was a tool for individual and group survival and that only those who could overcome completely self-centered interest and selfishness were those who survived.\n \n It is in one's enlightened self-interest to sacrifice a few individual rights to a group for the privilege of belonging to that group, such as the right to murder others or steal from other humans or hurt them in other ways.\n \n I feel very strongly that now, largely through evolution, humans are hard-wired not to murder. I could be provoked to murder if the provocation were strong enough, but in and of itself the idea of murdering someone, the idea of causing a person, a real, live, breathing person to cease to breathe, to cease to exist as a person, is anathema. And, I don't think that it is anything that was taught to me. Even as a child, I did not like the idea of being annihilated and it was easy for me to transfer an understanding to myself that others also would not like to be annihilated.\n \n To be sure, some humans are born or created with totally antisocialistic, nihilistic tendencies. Sociopaths.\n \n I am inclined to believe that George Walker Bush is one of those because he was totally unable to transfer unto himself the idea that a person would not want to be executed--and it seems, GWB stood in total judgment over a great number of executions without once considering DNA evidence proving them innocent or that they had become Christians and totally repented for what they had done.\n \n In a mere matter of moments, GWB was able to make a snap judgment and order the death of someone. Just as he has shown little concern for the more than half a million Iraqis who have been annihilated by his policies and actions.\n \n It is difficult to determine whether or not GWB was born this way or bred this way through his troubled childhood.",

   "http://www.commondreams.org/views/061700-102.htm\n \n Published on Saturday, June 17, 2000 in the New York Times\n Texas Executions:\n GW Bush Has Defined Himself, Unforgettably, As Shallow And Callous\n by Anthony Lewis\n BOSTON-There have been questions all along about the depth and seriousness of George W. Bush. They have been brought into sharp focus now by a surprising issue: the way the death penalty is administered in Texas. In his comments on that subject Governor Bush has defined himself, unforgettably, as shallow and callous.\n \n In his five years as governor of Texas, the state has executed 131 prisoners -- far more than any other state. Mr. Bush has lately granted a stay of execution for the first time, for a DNA test.\n \n In answer to questions about that record, Governor Bush has repeatedly said that he has no qualms. \"I'm confident,\" he said last February, \"that every person that has been put to death in Texas under my watch has been guilty of the crime charged, and has had full access to the courts.\"\n \n That defense of the record ignores many notorious examples of unfairness in Texas death penalty cases. Lawyers have been under the influence of cocaine during the trial, or been drunk or asleep. One court dismissed a complaint about a lawyer who slept through a trial with the comment that courts are not \"obligated to either constantly monitor trial counsel's wakefulness or endeavor to wake counsel should he fall asleep.\"\n \n This past week The Chicago Tribune published a compelling report on an investigation of all 131 death cases in Governor Bush's time. It made chilling reading.\n \n In one-third of those cases, the report showed, the lawyer who represented the death penalty defendant at trial or on appeal had been or was later disbarred or otherwise sanctioned. In 40 cases the lawyers presented no evidence at all or only one witness at the sentencing phase of the trial.\n \n In 29 cases, the prosecution used testimony from a psychiatrist who -- based on a hypothetical question about the defendant's past -- predicted he would commit future violence. Most of those psychiatrists testified without having examined the defendant: a practice condemned professionally as unethical.\n \n Other witnesses included one who was temporarily released from a psychiatric ward to testify, a pathologist who had admitted faking autopsies and a judge who had been reprimanded for lying about his credentials.\n \n Asked about the Tribune study, Governor Bush said, \"We've adequately answered innocence or guilt\" in every case. The defendants, he said, \"had full access to a fair trial.\"\n \n There are two ways of understanding that comment. Either Governor Bush was contemptuous of the facts or, on a matter of life and death, he did not care.\n \n At the heart of the problem is the Texas way of providing lawyers for defendants too poor to hire their own, as most are in death cases. There is no state system. Judges assign lawyers -- often lawyers who have contributed to their election campaigns.\n \n \"The State of Texas is a national embarrassment in the area of indigent legal services,\" a committee of the State Bar of Texas says in a report just approved. Again, Governor Bush has shown no concern about this reality. He vetoed a bill, passed by the legislature, that would have let Texas counties set up a limited public defender program for the poor.\n \n Capital punishment, long favored by a majority of Americans, has become a national issue again because of concern about the fairness of its administration. Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, imposed a moratorium on executions in that state after 13 men on death row were shown to be innocent. Pat Robertson and other conservatives have called for a national moratorium.\n \n The most complete study ever done of the death penalty process, by Prof. James S. Liebman and others at Columbia University, was published the other day. It showed that two-thirds of death convictions or sentences were upset on appeal for such reasons as incompetent defense lawyers or prosecutors who bent the rules.\n \n To all this George Bush is seemingly indifferent. Or perhaps not entirely. If he were not running for president, it is doubtful that he would just now have granted his first stay of execution. Next week Gary Graham, convicted of murder on the testimony of a single witness who said she saw him at night from 30 to 40 feet away, is due to be executed. Will Governor Bush care?",

Bush reduced the time on his calendar to review each death penalty case from 30 minutes to 15 minutes, according to an interview with his chief of staff conducted by the L.A. Times on August 3, 2000. Occasionally he reserves 30 minutes in order to review several executions scheduled to occur close together.\n \n -- Peter Grove Wenberg\n \n Bush's big lie is that his decisiveness in signing off on so many executions is an act of courage or conviction. It is, in fact, the opposite. His failure, for instance, to stop the execution of Gary Graham was an act of cowardice, motivated no doubt by political expediency. After all, what option did he have after painting himself into a corner with his steadfast insistence on the infallibility of the Texas criminal justice system? It would have taken courage to take a real look at the Graham case and acknowledge what was obvious to any thinking person: that the Graham verdict was neither reasonable on the evidence we know now, nor was it the result of a fair trial.\n \n Of course, it is difficult to assess whether Dubya's disingenuousness on this issue makes him more odious than his opponent. Although Gore has the intellectual honesty to recognize that the indiscriminate use of the death penalty has probably resulted in the execution of an innocent person, his abominable conclusion is that he still favors it because it is a deterrent.\n \n Ah, \"The death penalty as a deterrent.\" May I recommend that topic as the next installment of the \"Big Lie\" ...\n \n -- Brian McAllister",

   "CONDITIONAL CHRISTIAN LOVE\n Given that a fervent segment of the current audience in this philosophy forum is spreading and defending the 'word' then the following is posted for their philosophical 'enlightenment'.\n \n A cardinal claim by contemporary Christians is a professed love for Mankind. Superficially, this seems to be a noble value of Christianity, but how authentic is this dazzling 'love'. How ethical is conditional Christian love, when this tainted love is contrasted with the pure love of unconditional humanism?\n \n As I understand Christianity, love is tied to a bigger love for god, and to obediently love god, the Christian is compelled to profess a love for Mankind. This suggests the typical Christian loves Mankind because he is instructed to do so, and would not do so if he was not so directed. \n \n Love to the Christian does not come naturally; it is coerced by threats and promises echoed by the church throughout the centuries. \n \n Then consider humanists, such as Paolo Freire, who advocate an unconditional love for Mankind based on a shared humanity. There are no strings attached, this love is not underwritten by dubious gospels and myths.\n \n Christian conditional love is therefore logically negated, if not corrupted by its own messianic incentives. Loving mankind through a god, is damaged as this not only demonstrates the incapacity of the believer to love authentically, it reveals the selfish motive of the Christian who supposes the 'love'.\n\n \n as far as i understand the entire premise of the bible is fear and \"coercion\"...love christ or burn in hell",

For Christians OUR love must be based on the example of the love we have ourselves freely received through Jesus Christ.This love is unconditional, freely offered and never exhausted.\n\n \n Hi Kiwimac, you are right, of course. The problem we face here on debate forums as believers, is if for example, we discuss true submission and repentance before God by pointing to the sins one commits which we all need to turn away from. This is perceived by the unbeliever as judging and condemning them when it isn't that at all. It is simply acknowledging that we all have predominant sins which afflict us personally and which we must turn away from. \n \n One example is the sin of homosexuality; i have debated that subject extensively here and I don't compromise that God hates homosexuality, but never have I said or argued that God hates homosexuals. I have said just the opposite on every occasion and made it clear that God loves homosexuals unconditionally just as He loves all of us. They will argue though that if God loves them unconditionally, then He will compromise His publicly proclaimed moral standards and accept them as they are.\n \n How would you deal with that type of rationalizing when dealing with those who refuse to accept that our unconditional love for sinners doesn't mean that we will unconditionally approve of the sins they commit, be they straight sins or homosexual in nature?

You are truly a broken record as you offer the same complaint and accusation against me no matter that my replies are specific and on topic to questions asked of me. Why is it that you secular humanists believe in free speech, only when you agree with what is being said? Don't you realize that isn't free speech at all?\n \n And further more, It is only the spiritual truths which Gods word represents in the Holy Bible which offend and threaten that fallen and evil spirit which possesses you. I actually mourn for the fact that you are so disconnected with reality that you think that innate animosity within you is founded in intellectual superiority, when it is actually founded in spiritual darkness which places this demonic hatred within you for all that is good and righteous. You don't even understand that you are the true definition of a \"tool\" as that unwitting tool of satan in this spiritual battle we find ourselves in. I also repeat my prior post to you since you completely ignored it. emoticon_xdonno \n \n \nThe real question here is what motivates this abject hatred and spiritual insecurity within you that makes you believe that christianity is the least bit invasive? We don't promote forcing anyone to submit to Christ or die as Islam does for allah, because we understand that unless a personal relationship with God is sincere and a personal choice then it is mere lip service anyway. \n \n What we believers do here on debate forums is have the nerve to actually defend our beliefs in the living God who created us in His image in love against the attacks you make against Him and us in every post as your posts above prove. And for this, you liars and deceivers interpret everything we say in defense of ourselves and our beliefs as proselytizing or attempting to force you to accept Christ as your savior, when all we are actually doing in most cases is defending Him against the scurrilous lies you tell about Him. \n \n You are so dishonest in your debating style that if I respond to a specific question by someone regarding the question of how one gets saved, and I explain the salvation process supported by scripture passages, you will inevitably come back and accuse me of attempting to convert the board just because I answered a direct and specific question. Your dishonesty and hypocrisy is palpable as you feel justified in responding to any post I write on any subject by attacking God and accusing me of preaching. As evidence of this claim, I invite all thread observers to reread your posts above as I have quoted them and see how you never actually respond on point to anything I say, but you only attack my christianity and God on every occasion. emoticon_rolleyes\n",

   "I find that there are now many different factions or denominations that define themselves as \"Christian.\" There are many little things that seperate many denominations, and that also includes the ability or effort of showing forth love to your fellow man.\n \n \n There are some in my experience, denominational churches or brand of churches that say exactly what Archie has said, love the sinner hate the sin. But see that's a real form of hypocrisy is it not? I did not see Christ saying for us to hate anything.\n \n \n There seems to be a major split that I see. Churches that are more mainstream and accepting say of gays and lesbians and those that strictly do not. I see this as a form of \"conditional love\". Preaching the prejudices and stigmas and distortions trickled down by the elite of a religious organization to blind and obscure the true message of Christ.\n \n I tend to see this especially with those that follow such organizations as Focus on the Family or Family Research Council. Those buying into the \"family values\" bull that is a main selling point for those in political and religious power.\n \n Such words mask an underlying current and agenda that take root in churches to obscure and turn the church from a hollowed place of worship and focus upon God, into a platform for politics, prejudice, and campaigning. There is no separation of church and state especially when such churches under the guise of \"conditional love\" and \"family values\" legislate and become a political force in the country.\n \n I cannot tell you how many times I heard the same dribble echoed by Archie by a pastor Mike Rodriguez out of Calvary Chapel Corona saying he \"loved\" gays. But turned right around and literally mocked them. Calling their \"love\" not true in a demeaning tone, and comparing them to prisoners in pink saying to have them locked up with them..\n \n This is the \"conditional\" love sadly in many \"Christian\" churches. Under such a guise lies a hidden manifestation of contempt and venom and plot, that seeks to in a form of blind ignorance, due good when inf act these people are mere puppets by the elite who's agenda is a power struggle for the hearts of Americans every day.\n \n \n And what better way to win someone over to an ideal or stance on an issue but through faith or someones core beliefs? Change that, and you have them in your pocket.\n \n \n I believe there are still those churches and Christians with unconditional love. I am one of them. I do not judge or scorn or turn anyone away for any reason because I have had the same done to me. I have sat in these \"loving\" churches and felt my heart pierced by such arrogance and prejudice and scorn.\n \n It was not a message of Christ or redemption or love, but a message mixed with signals of party politics and agenda, and hate.\n \n I do not label all Christians as this, but more and more are flocking to the mega churches and the labels, and the bumper stickers, and the zealotry spawned out of the Jimmy Falwell's and the Pat Robertson brigades. Such a force is to be reckoned with especially when they play on the confused hearts and minds of ignorant loving Christians every single day...",

I think not or you would recognize that he is as big a hater and proclaimer of homosexual victimization at the hands of christians as foundit and every other homosexual here here who spews the party line. And here's a repeat of our exchange from the previous page as evidence of that.\n \n*clap clap clap* and through your fire and brimstone message you fail to see you have once again led astray another person by your rambling and fervent zealotry.....\n \n And hurray for once again establishing people who's views differ from yours to be sub human or below you hence your coined phrase \"ilk\". I wonder if someone would punch you in the mouth if you talked to them on the street in person like you do on these boards.\n \n Your audacity knows no bounds Mr Crusade..... Burn pillage and destroy the hearts of non believers in your greater quest for self recognition and self righteous reaffirmation in your wayward faith or lack thereof.... genius Archie genius....\n\n \n \nAm I supposed to be humbled by the love you're expressing my homosexual friend? Is this how you raise yourself above the fray and bring all sides together in peace? \n \n Now by all means please feel free to quote me ever saying that people who's views differ from mine to be sub human or that I have driven Ibelieveyou away from the truth in any way. Have you not followed his/her posts since coming here? She/he spews nothing but anti-christian hatred in every post. So my question to you as one who wants to appear objective, is why haven't you taken the tact of telling the newbie to respect the members of this forum if he/she expects to be respected in return? \n \n That would never occur to you would it Jason, and that's because you are nothing more than another reprobate hatemonger of the same ilk as Ibelieveyou whom you don't find offensive at all, as you attempt to excoriate me for defending myself against his/her anti-christian hate speech. Real consistent of you Jason, for a double minded and dishonest hypocrite that is. emoticon_xbye\n\n \n \nArchie I do not raise myself above the fray in the least. I can see both sides in this issue, both yours and Believer's. Both are misplaced and based upon assumption rather that looking at the broader spectrum of people with different views.\n \n Archie you HAVE driven people like believe away! It is your insulting and your wagging of the finger like a parent scolding a child! How do you ever expect someone who's only opinion upon Christians is that of assumption and stereotype to ever even consider or change their opinion when in action you REAFFIRM these things! \n \n And Archie there ya go calling someone a \"newb\" or demanding \"respect\" on this board. Because this person has a strong opinion against yours you cry foul and attempt to say it is a personal attack when in actuality it is someones generalization of a group of people hence a form of prejudice. \n \n Oh and thank you for the lovely compliments Archie. Really CHRISTIAN like of you right? Really racks up the points with the G man up stair hmm? You make me sick. You resemble nothing even CLOSE to that of a Christian...\n \n How dare you call me a hypocrite when Jesus himself said do unto others and to forgive your brother infinite amount of times. And did you forget about John saying that the tongue should not both praise god and curse his neighbor?? You are double minded!!!! You fail to see that in your pride and arrogance and desperate zeal to justify your faith you have not only pushed away those most in need of a positive message of hope and love through Christ, but you have also reaffirmed those prejudices and stereotypes upon all peoples of faith once more!!\n\n \n \nBlah blah blah... More vapid and vacuous lip service from the forums hypocrite and double minded homosexual defender. He who attempts to use the bible as a weapon to condemn me with, but ignores its personal message for himself as he lays with men, which is an abomination to the God of the same bible he quotes against me. Nice job, but look in the mirror if you really want an interested audience in anything spiritual which you have to say.\n\n \n \nHow am I condemning you Archie? I am merely stating that you are DRIVING people away from the message of Christ with your blind scorn and pride! At least I have the decency to actually read your posts and respond in turn to them.\n \n You just cover your ears and scream to drown out anything of sense... I love how you call me a hypocrite Archie when you fail to even produce one shred of love or compassion to those who maybe have none in this life. Maybe those on this board who defend against Christianity are the ones most in need! Maybe if they saw past your drivel and crazed prejudice and self righteous indignation maybe just maybe they could see the true message of Christ and not your incessant rambling...\n \n JUST because I believe in true unconditional love for all peoples through Christ and I do not shun others who may be different or may not believe does not validate anything of me being a hypocrite. And be being Gay and having a committed monogamous relationship surely does not either.\n \n You have no love Archie. You only have love for self reaffirmation of your faith. You only love to see those who differ from you squashed like a bug under your boot and you certainly have the air of a pompous self centered religious elitist who cares nothing of the slightest for those in true need of hope and love.\n \n Why is it that I can see this? Why is it that I reach out with an unbiased hand without condition or bias to even those who deem Christianity ridiculous or worse? Why is it that I do not trample upon these peoples opinions? \n \n Because I realize their human beings Archie. That we are all in the same and that we are all here on this earth trying to make sense of the chaos that is life in our own way. And that these people need to see that there are some out there who believe in Christ that are not biased and prejudiced and certainly not full of arrogant pride that is masked as spirituality. And that is exactly what you are doing and exactly what you are....\n\n \n \nI sadly see not so much a form of hate as I do of an underlying layer of pain. You see many of the wounds suffered in the gay community sadly have come from that of a religious view.

Are we to ignore that aspect of Gods word so we don't make you feel uncomfortable or convicted of your blatant sin against Him and ultimately, yourselves as you do what He says is so self destructive? Are you incapable of recognizing that we are expressing true love for you by telling you the hard truth, no matter how painful it is to say and hear? NOOOOO!!!

Yes I am!\n \n But Archie do not take me opposing another persons views as personal vindication of the sort. I do not personally attack like you and Easy or degrade you or dehumanize you. Instead I point out the fallacy in your rationale. If it is too blunt for you, sorry get over it. You and Easy have not only been blunt, but to the point of personal insult and slander of a group of people out of sheer prejudice!\n \n \n Have I not stated that I am in fact a Christian? That I believe in the validity of Christ and His love. But yet I am gay Archie yes I am. And I am also in a committed monogamous relationship with one whom I love. You fail to see it Archie. You Refuse to acknowledge that the love of gay people is just as real and passionate as that of heterosexuals.\n \n Archie I know many many Christians who are accepting of gays and welcome them with open arms in fellowship and unbiased affection. Just because they are not fundamentalists like yourself or Easy gives you no reason or right to call them any more or any less a believer than you. \n \n But of course it doesn't matter. You only see gays in a carnal light. You refuse to see us in any other manner and you of your own choice keep it that way! You remain blind because you choose to stay in prejudice and stay in the ways of intolerance and stay in the ways of half hearted love... THAT is what this is about Archie.\n \n And I know it must XXXX you off to no degree being called out for what you and Easy truly are, but tough! Maybe just maybe you'll realize that love is not based upon pre existing assumptions, or labels, or skin color, or religion or lack thereof! Love is unbiased!\n \n And THAT is what Christ preached and did in his miracles from the prostitute to the leper. He challenged the elite of his day the religious ones. Those going through the motions and not having a heart and being sincere with all the people.\n \n Your half hearted along with Easy Archie. And you prove it with every single post you make....",

   "CONDITIONAL CHRISTIAN LOVE\n Given that a fervent segment of the current audience in this philosophy forum is spreading and defending the 'word' then the following is posted for their philosophical 'enlightenment'.\n \n 1. A cardinal claim by contemporary Christians is a professed love for Mankind. Superficially, this seems to be a noble value of Christianity, but how authentic is this dazzling 'love'. How ethical is conditional Christian love, when this tainted love is contrasted with the pure love of unconditional humanism?\n \n 2. As I understand Christianity, love is tied to a bigger love for god, and to obediently love god, the Christian is compelled to profess a love for Mankind. This suggests the typical Christian loves Mankind because he is instructed to do so, and would not do so if he was not so directed. \n \n 3. Love to the Christian does not come naturally; it is coerced by threats and promises echoed by the church throughout the centuries. \n \n 4. Then consider humanists, such as Paolo Freire, who advocate an unconditional love for Mankind based on a shared humanity. There are no strings attached, this love is not underwritten by dubious gospels and myths.\n \n 5. Christian conditional love is therefore logically negated, if not corrupted by its own messianic incentives. Loving mankind through a god, is damaged as this not only demonstrates the incapacity of the believer to love authentically, it reveals the selfish motive of the Christian who supposes the 'love'.\n\n \n 1. * Hm... The dazzling \"Love\", is authentic for some, although, for some people who profess to be Christians, what you say is very true. However, I can say, from experience, that you cannot base that upon all Christians, as a lot of us have unconditional love. Again, I will state that my first answer stands for this question also. You can't base a few experiences with some Christians of your description, and use that for the rest of us. It's a biased opinion, that greatly ruins respect, and dignity for the rest of us, who must be on the receiving end of it.*\n \n \n 2. * This is where my favorite activist (And I'm not too sure that activist is the right term for him) comes in. What you speak of is what Ghandi himself was an example of, and he was a Hindu. Therefor, this proves that it does not only go for Christians. So, how could you say that, when normal people also love mankind unconditionally? Also, and I know that you are going to say that his religion also called for him to love unconditionally, but even atheist people love unconditionally, so that proves nothing. Also, some Christians would do without instruction. I cannot say that for everyone, and I know for a fact that I cannot always say that for me, but I can say that for some people.*\n \n \n \n 3. * Actually, that is untrue. The threats that you speak of: ?. We do not receive any threats that I know of. We are told to love GOD unconditionally, or else we will not reach eternity, but not each other. Of course, it is ideal for a Christian, and it is a rule that we assume that we are to follow without question, but that is not actually stated. The rewards that you speak of: Favor with GOD, and I can't tell if we can actually always gain favor with him. What we will gain, is a more peaceful way to live our lives. And again I state: To some Christians it does come naturally. You can't base a couple of us and make it stand for all of us.*\n \n \n 4. * Hm... And why am I considering him? Because he teaches what the Christian religion teaches, yet with no actual religion? In all honesty, I don't really consider that worth consideration. How does it help your case, stating what I stated about Ghandi, in a previous response?*\n \n \n 5. * That, my friend, is where you are terribly wrong. Again, I will state, NOT ALL CHRISTIANS LOVE OTHERS BECAUSE GOD TOLD THEM TO! SOME OF THEM LOVE OTHERS BECAUSE THAT IS JUST THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT THEY ARE! YOU CANNOT BASE YOUR CONFRONTATION WITH ONE CHRISTIAN, ON THE REST OF THE CHRISTIANS!*",
