   "From here:\n \n \n\n Danielle Deaver was about 22 weeks into her pregnancy when doctors told her she wouldn't be able to carry to term and her child would die soon after birth. Then to her surprise, she learned doctors couldn't end her non-viable pregnancy because of a new Nebraska law barring late-term abortions.\n [...]\n \n The law bans abortions after 20 weeks based on the disputed notion that fetuses can feel pain after that point. It prevented doctors from medically inducing Deaver to go into labor, and they told her she would have to go into labor naturally.\n \n Ten days later, on Dec. 8, she gave birth to a baby girl named Elizabeth who died in her mother's arms after 15 minutes.\n [...]\n \n Nebraska Right to Life executive director Julie Schmit-Albin said Sunday that the law is meant to protect all unborn babies. Her group pushed for the law last year in the state Legislature.\n \n \"We acknowledge the tragedy that occurs with a poor prenatal diagnosis for the baby. But isn't it more humane for the baby to die in a loving manner with comfort care and in the arms of her parents than by the intentional painful death through abortion?\" she said\n\n \n Yeah... there needs to be exceptions for something like this.",

I was speaking to a woman a week ago who has three children, one conceived through rape. And also one miscarriage. She explained to me that after the miscarriage she had her womb scraped. During the process of having her womb scraped she was awake and in alot of pain. Her conclusion to her experiences was this. The child conceived from rape is loved as much as her two planned children, and in fact was able to minimize the emotional pain everytime she sees her now 11 year old daughter . And the miscarriage left her sterile and in more emotional pain for the loss of the child she will never know.",
