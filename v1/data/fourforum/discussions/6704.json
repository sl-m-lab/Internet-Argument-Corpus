Off course, it is actually the tip of the iceberg- total US casualties are around 15000, plus other coalition dead/wounded.

His father had a LOT more sense. He dropped US support of the Shia when it became apparent that after Saddam was deposed they would be closely alinged with Iran. He called the possibility of an Iran-Iraq alliance \"much more dangerous than haivng Saddam in posession of even nuclear arms\". This was AFTER Saddam tried to have him assasinated.\n\n OK, I'll concede the point.",

   "The economic fallout from the war is NOTHING compared to what an announcement of $300 billion in immediate extra social spending (really, social spending would require even more for the same amount because flow through is not as great). At the very least, we would certainly NOT have Bush in the whitehouse for a second term. \n \n Instead, we go to war. This turns our negative GDP growth to the positive, the bush administartion gets a little boost (at least until the american people figured out they had been lied to and screwed) in popularity, and a chance to push the fascist neocon agenda.\n \n I do think that Bush and his little crew of merry men honestly did believe that Iraq would become a western style democracy. I think they were lying their butts off about WMDs, but I do think they were foolish enough, arrogant enough, and ignorant enough to belive that Iraq would transform itself into a little America at the first opportunity.\n\n Maybe so, but I think an economic benefit from a war was not really on their minds and if it is was, it was on the back burner for sure. There just isn't any real hard evidence to show this was a reason.",
