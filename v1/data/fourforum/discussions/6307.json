I know there have been writings (several ancient) about how barbaric and sinful people were ages ago. If one does not have that knowledge, then explaining how it changed would have to be taken on faith. I would encourage everyone that has trouble in realizing how this could have happened - how a just and loving God could do this - to read very carefully the Bible as it is written, along with the manuscripts. \n Furthermore, anyone confronted with this explanation must be thorough in his analysis of the situation. We will need to move toward this issue from different angles to ensure we have seen it clearly and from a broad perspective.\n Let's take Sodom and Gomorrah for example. Religion would have us to think that God just didn't like these people and if you ask many religionists, they'll render unto you the \"story\". What they fail to divulge is the fact that God had Melchizedek to witness to them over and over again. However, his ministry was ineffective as we read that they paraded their sin or brazenly showed off their disregard for the Word of God.\n \n The book of Jonah is a great read to help us understand how God works and how His will was not to kill. Nineveh is an example of what the other nations should have done - if the other nations had only listened to God's Word. The book of Jonah is also a wakeup call for us today - a reminder that we too are to speak the true Words of God and not the watered-down, politically-correct, pacific version. But I digress...\n \n After Nineveh heard and obeyed, they were spared (even though they later went back to their sinful ways and were destroyed). But God was compassionate for He has never wanted to destroy wicked people, but has always wanted to destroy evil. After the people turned away from wickedness and violence, He said, \"But Nineveh has more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and many cattle as well. Should I not be concerned about that great city?\" (Jonah 4:11) His concern was for the people and their belongings, just as it is today.\n \n Sin kills, not God. Another example that it's sin that causes death is when God says, \"After the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, 'The LORD has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.' No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is going to drive them out before you.\" (Deut 9:4)\n \n What is most misunderstood is God's ways - that's why so many people today blame Him for all the bad things that happen. How many posts on this forum have you seen praising God for the good things He does? So, it is the misunderstood words of the Bible that have put God in such a \"bad\" light.",

   "Johnhanks, Orion, Johnson,\n \n I could give you many scriptures that would reflect my view of the subject, but they would not satisfy you. In fact they might even make you want further explanation until all the scriptures and sources are exhausted. But, the way I see it, what most is wondered is why sin affected children and the unborn. Is that correct? If so, I can only give you what I gather from the information given us.\n Firstly, the people that had been overcome with evil were consumed with it. They lived by it and it lived through them even to the point that they murdered (sacrificed) their own children to it. If the children weren't murdered then they were kept only for the sake of evil and nothing more. They grew up knowing no love whatsoever and continually did what their parents did, generation after generation, during which time wickedness was compounded. But that's not entirely the point is it? The point is, the children suffered the fate of the adults and all children are considered innocent. Then how could this work of judgment be performed at all? Let's not forget that throughout all these times of evil, times of trouble, God gave sufficient \"early warning\" and many, many people fled, leaving behind their wickedness. Those that stayed, or continued in sin, evil, wickedness, were the ones that were killed - and they are the ones that decided whether their children lived or died.\n \n If you were told that a hurricane was going to hit your area, told what day it would hit shore, was told that 30 ft waves would spread 10 miles inland and annihilate all in its path, would you stay or move out? Whose fault is it if you stayed? In some instances God gave them years to repent. This applied to Israel also. God does not discriminate. If Israel did (and they did) what the wicked nations did, then they too would face judgment...and did face it. At the 2nd battle in the land of Canaan (AI in Joshua 7) an Israelite kept some of the forbidden sacred images and God judged him, his family, and the entire nation for this breach of covenant, just like He was judging the Canaanites. There was no double standard then, or later in the Northern and Southern kingdoms.\n \n An individual's actions affect those around him - we are our brother's keeper. It is widely accepted that God did the entire killing without reason nor remorse, but those that accept that idea have not approached the reasons from all directions by carefully reading the scriptures. They follow the words line upon line, but not precept upon precept. After understanding what happened I think you will agree that the deaths innocent of children, who would and did receive mercy from God, would be far better than living a life of wickedness.",

They grew up knowing no love whatsoever and continually did what their parents did, generation after generation, during which time wickedness was compounded.\n\n \n Exactly. The population pyramid of evil-doers was growing exponentially year after year, with more and more of these people dying and arriving in hell every day. Add to that the growing number of victims of their evil and you have a massive cancer. Cutting them off after fair warning before they could grow into the multi-millions actually saves a great number of individuals from going to the pit. \n \n Of course Orion and the naysayers will vomit this out.

   "There are two very glaring problems with this idea that we shouldn't believe in a God that has wiped people out from time to time in history.\n \n One, the story of this God needs to be read in full context and wholistically, rather than in snippets, which is how the naysayers portray things here. The wrath of God has been satisfied in Christ. We therefore have a God who has been willing to give us life and not death.\n \n Two, to hate God or disbelieve in Him because He has killed people at times in history doesn't take into account the fact that God would have known the big picture and the future of someone. IOW, who's to say that God wasn't doing a beneficial thing for the human race by wiping out certain infants, given the fact that He would have known what their future lives would entail? It's a similar idea that some pro-abortion people use when they say things like 'abortion should be ok since that fetus might grow up to be another Hitler' or something. Except in the case of God, He would actually know for sure how the infant would grow up.\n \n And for that matter, one could easily make the argument that God has allowed infants all throughout history to die anyway--stilborn births and miscarriages. I suppose the only way that the naysayers would be happy with a God they are determined to find fault with is for Him to make our lives like robots, where nothing bad or even unexpected could ever happen, and where we have no freedom of choice to screw anything up.\n \n Sorry, I'll take belief in God instead.",

They lived by it and it lived through them even to the point that they murdered (sacrificed) their own children to it. If the children weren't murdered then they were kept only for the sake of evil and nothing more.\n\n \n I'd be interested to see your scriptural references for this. Better still, of course, would be contemporary references from a disinterested party, rather than an enemy's self-justifying propaganda.\n \n \nThe point is, the children suffered the fate of the adults and all children are considered innocent. Then how could this work of judgment be performed at all? Let's not forget that throughout all these times of evil, times of trouble, God gave sufficient \"early warning\" and many, many people fled, leaving behind their wickedness. Those that stayed, or continued in sin, evil, wickedness, were the ones that were killed - and they are the ones that decided whether their children lived or died.\n\n \n Where does scripture detail the early warning given to the Amalekites?\n \n \nAfter understanding what happened I think you will agree that the deaths innocent of children, who would and did receive mercy from God, would be far better than living a life of wickedness.\n\n \n [Shudder]",

Would that suffice or would it be a waste of time?\n \nWhere does scripture detail the early warning given to the Amalekites?\n\n You and trebor really like to lay it on me with \"details\", johnhanks. :)\n Instead of barging into the city of Amalek (1Sam 15:6) Saul told the Kenites that a battle was about to ensue and to flee. These neighbors and a few of the Amalekites that obeyed escaped from the battle. Some say that there was no warning directly made to the Amalekites, but history shows that several were spared because after Saul died, David had to go into battle with them once again.(2 Sam 1:1) And even then some were spared because approx. 250 years later, in the time of Hezekiah (1 Chr 4:43) there was another war with them.\n \n In the book of Exodus (7), the Amalekite's cowardly attack on Israel angered God on two counts: Firstly, they failed to recognize the sovereignty of God in Israel's life and destiny. In Joshua 2:10 we read that even the Canaanites of Jericho had been given ample time to think about what they had heard about in the exodus if Israel. Secondly, the first targets of their warfare were the sick, aged, and tired of Israel who lagged behind the lines. (Deut 25:17-19).\n \n[Shudder]\n \n I agree...unless that was subtle sarcasm.",

   "There's no doubt that anything proving the Bible is right or wrong would be better than just the plain old Bible for you, johnhanks, and if I were in your shoes that would be what I would want. All I have, however, is scripture. Would that suffice or would it be a waste of time?\n\n \n By no means a waste of time: quote me the scripture that tells us the Amalekites\n \n \nlived by [evil] and it lived through them even to the point that they murdered (sacrificed) their own children to it. If the children weren't murdered then they were kept only for the sake of evil and nothing more. They grew up knowing no love whatsoever and continually did what their parents did, generation after generation, during which time wickedness was compounded\n\n \n \n \n \nYou and trebor really like to lay it on me with \"details\", johnhanks. :)\n \n\n \n Not unfairly, I hope. The point is, if you make detailed and categorical allegations like the one above, people are going to ask you to substantiate them.\n \n \n\n Instead of barging into the city of Amalek (1Sam 15:6) Saul told the Kenites that a battle was about to ensue and to flee. These neighbors and a few of the Amalekites that obeyed escaped from the battle. Some say that there was no warning directly made to the Amalekites...\n\n \n Well Samuel certanily doesn't mention one:\n \n \n1 Samuel 15:6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.\n 1 Samuel 15:7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.\n\n \n \n\n ... but history shows that several were spared ...\n\n \n Not, it shows that some survived. Not the same thing.\n \n \nIn Joshua 2:10 we read that even the Canaanites of Jericho had been given ample time to think about what they had heard about in the exodus if Israel.\n\n \n Not quite. In the words of Rahab the harlot (biblical language, not mine) we hear that the inhabitants of Jericho had heard of the Israelites' annihilation of other tribes and were not unreasonably afraid of these aggressive and merciless newcomers. (It's an interesting commentary on the bible's double standards that Rahab's treacherous betrayal of her own people, purely to save her and her family's skin, is portrayed as admirable.)",

I can't even understand it!!\n\n God will always be past our understanding. I have no answers other than those I have given.\n \n \nNot to worry. As levels of even mediocre US higher education continue to rise producing non-theists combined with immigration and acceptance of global society influences, US reliance on the mythical belief system Christianity as a dominant life style factor is expected to cease around 2035 when followers of Christianity drop below the 50% mark as a percentage of US population. But like most strength in number species, the fundamentalist sect won't see it coming until they're viewed as a pagan branch by the older, more structured sectors and excluded from power.\n\n I think it's headed in the direction we are told it would - not just the USA, but the whole world. The more God is forced from the public, the more influence the Powers of Darkness will have over the populace. Already we're seeing \"justified\" murders of unborn children and repeated exposure to perverse sex acts on TV and on the big screen. Our children are bombarded with notions that they only act right when on drugs that make them fit into subsumable majority.\n So, yes, I would say that there's no need to worry.\n \n \nBy no means a waste of time: quote me the scripture that tells us the Amalekites\n\n Are you referring to being forewarned? If not, please let me know.\n \nNot, it shows that some survived. Not the same thing.\n\n How did they escape? They were warned by the Kenites. That's what I believe. Of course neither you nor I can actually say for sure.\n \nNot quite. In the words of Rahab the harlot (biblical language, not mine) we hear that the inhabitants of Jericho had heard of the Israelites' annihilation of other tribes and were not unreasonably afraid of these aggressive and merciless newcomers. (It's an interesting commentary on the bible's double standards that Rahab's treacherous betrayal of her own people, purely to save her and her family's skin, is portrayed as admirable.)\n\n Or that she had quite a bit more sense and was able to capitalize on that knowledge...\n However, she does state that she believes God and proclaimed His greatness.
