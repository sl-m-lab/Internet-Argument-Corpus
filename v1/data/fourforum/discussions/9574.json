That said, I think it foolish to claim/believe that the bible is all wrong. I consider myself an atheist, but I fully recognize - and expect - that much, perhaps even most of the events mentioned in the bible actually occurred. I do, however, also realize that the books of the bible were written at a much different time, that even real events were likely embellished, in some cases to the point of absurdity (knocking down walls with great shouts and the like...). Although I do not and will not pretend to be a biblical scholar or historian of any sort, it seems to me that the bible could be seen as a biased, mythology-laden chronicle of the history of a particular group of people. Interesting historically, but not very reliable as a guide to the true events of the time, and even less so for a guide to moral behavior and describing a Universe-creating Deity.\n\n \n I wish to wave the flag for the middle ground.

It all started as a very large flood (probably in a river valley) that was much larger than normal (say a \"500-year-flood\" or a larger discharge event), possibly destroying a bunch of dwellings and maybe killing a lot of people, but some surviving leading to the Noah character.

   "**\n Ripskar says;--\n \n \"It [a tsunami--ww] was raised as a \"scientific\" possibility, except that it is actually a scientific impossibility.\"\n \n **\n Ripskar makes this claim without ever producing any scientific evidence precluding the possibility of a huge tsunami following the flow of the Tigris/Euphrates, backing the river into a huge flood covering many square miles and extending miles inland. Instead he claims only that, since the legend says was caused by a 'deluge', then the flood had to have been caused by extensive heavy rains, and that since the legend claims that the survivors floated around in an 'ark' of some kind, and for quite a long while, then the flood itself had to have been a protracted affair. Taking myth literally is the kind of thing that the ripskar types mistake for \"science\", allowing them to dismiss the tsunami hypothesis as \"a scientific impossibility\", without so much as a drop of science to back him up. And, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly what ripskar inelegantly characterizes as \"effectively talking out of your arse\". Apparently he's the expert on that form of speech. Or perhaps he is saddled with the literalist creationist mentality, but just doesn't have the wit to realize it.\n He continues--\n \n \" For some bizare(sic) reason it then developed a band wagon insiting(sic) that it was still a possibility despite the fact that it had been shown to be impossible.\"\n \n First, peteratwar and h.i.m. hardly constitute a bandwagon, and even I who originated the notion in this thread, have only claimed that it is one of several possibilities, including a great typhoon, that might be the cause of the huge aquatic natural catastrophe that has been historically perpetuated in folk tale and myth as, \"The Great Flood\". But people who habitually speak via their intestinal gasses and outlets, like a certain, \"Blood Ax Ork Warlord\" (What are you?!? Ten?!!!), can always be expected to distort and exaggerate. They especially love to distort their own success at argumentation, as per the false claim that \"it[the tsunami hypothesis-ww] had been shown to be impossible.\"\n \n And at risk of boring you good people, we hear him go on to claim that---\n \n \"Making an unsupported assertion in the face of the data, (presumably without actual reference to the data) is effectively talking out of your arse, and at some length it would seem.\"\n \n As I said earlier, this applies to no-one as well as it does to the mighty 'ork warlord', himself. The only 'data' available are the details imbedded within all of the various global myth stories. Since the biblical myth is the one at the centre of our focus, and since we can trace that myth back to the 18th century BCE, it would be best to focus on what was recorded at that time about a Mesopotamian flood myth. see--\n http://www.answers.com/topic/atra-hasis\n It appears that the first flood 'hero' used his disassembled reed hut to make a reed boat. Reeds suggest marshes, to me. Prime area for tsunami devastation. Or a typhoon's 'surge', if close enough to the sea, as in New Orleans. \n Other tales speak of the land being 'as flat as a table' after the flood, and only a typhoon or a tsunami, with their moving masses of water, would do that; a local river flood would only flatten that which was engulfed by river itself, not the entire land.\n There is reference to a 'great wind', i.e., typhoon, from the South, i.e., out of the Persian Gulf, and although that is definitely a possibility, as I said in an earlier post, if a wave of water came rushing over the land from the sea, as a tsunami, it would be logical to attribute such a great wave to a great wind, whether there was one or not. After all, even the earliest cuneiform fragments are taken from an oral tradition passed on for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years after any actual catastrophic event.\n \n Anyhoo, the point of this post is not to establish the natural roots of flood mythology, since that is unlikely to ever be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. In fact, nobody really gives a toss whether it is or isn't, except for narrow-minded biblical literalists of the abrahamic tradition. I, for one, could not care less.\n \n So why does ripskar jump up on his ork warhorse, swinging his 'blood ax' and making rude intestinal noises? Well, I suspect that it is because the 'tsunami' explanation was _my_ suggestion, and that it is not that suggestion, but myself personally, that he objects to. I do not know why I have drawn his animosity, since I tend to ignore his sort, but I'm not bothered by it. I'd much prefer to have 'blood ax ork warlord types' for enemies, rather than for friends and admirers.",

   "No Electrolyte, science lies! here is the undisputed truth:\n \n Noah and his three sons traveled the globe, collected two representatives of each species (or seven of each clean species depending on the chapter).\n \n \n No they didn't Mutz, the animals came to them 2 by 2.\n \n \nThey crammed these critters in a sea worthy vessel made exclusively of gopher wood. The gopher wood was structurally sound enough to support the weight of said critters. The ark floated about like a cork for 40 days, etc whereupon the cargo was released to repopulate the world to present population levels.\n \n \n Many of the animals were young so they weighed less than full grown animals, they didn't get pregnant and make more animals during the journey and they consumed less food because of their size. I'm surprised you didn't know that Mutz.\n \n \nMeanwhile, there must have been provisions on the Ark for marine animals and fish as the rainwater would have undoubtedly altered the water pH and saline content. Also not mentioned is the fact that Noah and sons must have collected seeds from every PLANT on earth because I am personally not aware of many plant types that can survive completely submerged for 40 days.\n\n \n Oh really ? Parts of New Orleans were under water for more than 40 days before all the water receeded. Hasn't the plant life there replenished naturally in the wild ? Of course it has. The Earth is very able to repair itself in spite of modern mans sense of self importance. Here's some interesting photographic evidence of it. www.pbase.com/andrys/noah \n \n \nSo you see, it is much harder to believe in a fossil record and sediment deposit stratigraphy, than in a giant boat crammed to the gills full of elephants, octopus, and cacti. I hope I cleared this up for everyone. We have found fossils, but they are all fake. We have not found an ark....but it is real....\n\n \n Fossils aren't fake Mutz, the ages that the fake scientists attribute to them are, see what I mean ? :) And the petrified wood structure that exists on Mt Ararat is pretty impressive evidence that something big and made of wood is way up on the side of a mountain, and no one can figure why or how it got there other than by way of Noah's flood. And here's a scholarly article from the biblical perspective that points out the different interpretations Theologians consider, both conservative and liberal.\n \n http://www.grisda.org/origins/22058.htm\n \n BIBLICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE\n UNIVERSALITY OF THE GENESIS FLOOD\n Richard M. Davidson\n John Nevin Andrews Professor of Old Testament Interpretation\n Old Testament Department\n Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan\n Origins 22(2):58-73 (1995). \n \n WHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT\n \n The extent of the Genesis Flood has been vigorously debated by biblical scholars. For those who accept a recent creation week of six literal consecutive, twenty-four-days, a universal Flood is necessary to explain the existence of the geologic column. The thesis of this study is that only the traditional interpretation which posits a literal, universal, world-wide Genesis Flood does full justice to all the relevant biblical data. The author summarizes twenty-two lines of biblical evidence - including terminological, thematic, contextual, grammatical-syntactical, literary-structural, logical-conceptual, theological, canonical, and typological which support the universality of the Genesis Flood.\n \n PLEASE NOTE: Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce all of the special accent marks that were present in our printed version of the Hebrew transliteration. Our apologies for any inconvenience this might cause.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n I. Conflicting Schools of Interpretation\n \n One of the most controversial aspects of the Flood narrative concerns the extent of the Genesis Flood. Three major positions are taken: (1) the traditional, which asserts the universal, world-wide, nature of the Deluge; (2) limited or local flood theories, which narrow the scope of the Flood story to a particular geographical location in Mesopotamia; and (3) non-literal (symbolic) interpretation, which suggests that the Flood story is a non-historical account written to teach theological truth.\n Against this third position, the non-historical, we must note the evidences within the biblical account affirming the historical nature of the Flood. In the literary structure of the Flood story (see Shea 1979), the genealogical frame or envelope construction (Genesis 5:32 and 9:28-29) plus the secondary genealogies (Genesis 6:9-10 and 9:18-19) are indicators that the account is intended to be factual history. The use of the genealogical term t\u00f4led\u00f4t (\"generations,\" \"account\") in the Flood story (6:9) as throughout Genesis (13 times, structuring the whole book), indicates that the author intended this story to be as historically veracious as the rest of Genesis (Doukhan 1978, p 167-220). Walter Kaiser analyzes the literary form of Genesis 1-11 and concludes that this whole section of Genesis must be taken as \"historical narrative prose\" (Kaiser 1970).\n A number of references in the book of Job may allude to the then-relatively-recent Flood (Job 9:5-8; 12:14-15; 14:11-12; 22:15-17; 26:10-14; 28:9; 38:8-11; see Morris 1988, p 26-30). The historical occurrence of the Flood is part of the saving/judging acts of God, and its historicity is assumed and essential to the theological arguments of later biblical writers employing Flood typology (see Davidson 1981, p 326-327); more on this point later.\n Thus according to the biblical writers, far from being a non-historical, symbolical, or mythical account written only to teach theological truths, the Flood narrative is intended to accurately record a real, literal, historical event.\n For evangelical Christians who take seriously the biblical record and accept the historicity of the Flood account, the question still remains whether the event described is to be taken as a local, limited flood or a universal, world-wide cataclysm.\n The limited flood theories rest primarily on scientific arguments that present seemingly difficult geological, biological, and anthropological problems for a universal flood. (See Boardman 1990, p 212-223; Custance 1979, p 28-58; Kidner 1967, p 93-95; Mitchell 1982/1993; Ramm 1954, p 232-249; Young 1977, p 171-210). Since the scientific argumentation is not the subject of this article, I can only suggest that these problems are not insurmountable, although much more study is needed. A number of studies provides a growing body of evidence for diluvial catastrophism as an alternative to conventional long-age geology (see Coffin and Brown 1983; Roth 1985, 1986a, 1988; Whitcomb 1988; Baumgardner 1994a,b).\n The local flood theories further assert that the terminology describing the extent of the Flood should be interpreted in a relative and not absolute universal sense. The various seemingly universal terms are regarded as implying only a limited locality; they are seen to indicate universality within the writer's world-view but a limited scope in terms of our modern world view. (See Boardman 1990, p 223-226; Custance 1979, p 15-27; Kidner 1967, p 93-95; Ramm 1954, p 241-242.) We will take up this issue in the next section of this article.\n The traditional conservative understanding of the Flood narrative is that Genesis 6-9 describes a universal, world-wide Deluge. It should be noted that this is also the view of the majority of liberal-critical commentators on Genesis 6-9, although they regard the biblical view as borrowed from the ANE accounts and not historical. (See Hasel 1975, p 78 and Note 16 for bibliography of representatives of this position: Fohrer, Koehler, Noth, Procksch, Skinner, Sarna, Speiser, von Rad, Vriezen, Zimmerli, etc. Some of these and other more recent representatives of this view are cited later in this article.)\n The thesis of this article is that only the traditional position of a literal, universal world-wide Flood does full justice to the biblical data, and this universal interpretation is crucial for Flood theology in Genesis and for the theological implications drawn by later biblical writers.\n \n II. Biblical Terminology in Genesis 6-9 Indicating Universality\n \n Perhaps the most important kind of biblical evidence for a universal Flood is the specific all-inclusive terminology found within the Genesis account itself. The late Gerhard Hasel has provided a careful treatment of this terminology in three penetrating studies in previous issues of Origins (Hasel 1974, 1975, 1978), and therefore I need not go into detail in this article. Eight different terms or phrases in Genesis 6-9, most echoing their counterparts in the world-wide creation account of Genesis 1-2, indicate universality.\n First, the term ha\u00c9ares \"the earth,\" occurring 46 times in the Flood narrative (Genesis 6:12, 13, 17, etc.), always without any accompanying genitive of limitation, clearly parallels the usage of the same term in the account of world-wide, universal creation in Genesis 1:1, 2, 10. (While the term at times elsewhere may be used without a genitive and still in context be limited in scope to a certain \"land,\" the explicit link to creation in the Flood account (see especially Genesis 6:6, 7) clearly gives a universal context for its usage in Genesis 6-9.)\n Some have argued that if Moses had wished to indicate the entire world, he would have used the Hebrew term tebel, which means the world as a whole, or dry land in the sense of continents. This word is never used in the Flood narrative. But it should be pointed out that tebel is never used in the entire Pentateuch, including the creation account. In fact, the term appears no where in the narrative portions of the Hebrew Bible, but only in poetic texts (39 times) usually as a poetic synonym in parallel with ha\u00c9ares \"the earth.\" Thus this argument from silence does not adequately consider the contextual and poetic use of terminology, and carries little weight.\n A second expression, \"upon the face of all the earth\" \u00ccal-pen\u00ea kol-ha\u00c9ares (Genesis 7:3; 8:9), clearly alludes to the first occurrence of the same phrase in the universal context of creation (Genesis 1:29; cf. Genesis 1:2 for a related universal expression), and thus here also implies a universality of the same dimension, i.e., the entire surface of the global mass. While the shortened term \"all the earth\" (kol-ha\u00c9ares) by itself may have a limited meaning elsewhere when indicated by the immediate context (see Exodus 10:5, 15; Numbers 22:5, 11; 1 Kings 4:34; 10:24; 2 Chronicles 36:23; Genesis 41:57), the immediate context of the Flood story is the universal sinfulness of humankind whom God had made and created (Genesis 6:6,7) to have dominion over \"all the earth\" (Genesis 1:26), and the succeeding context is the universal dispersal of man after the Tower of Babel \"upon the face of all the earth\" (Genesis 11:4, 8, 9). In each of the four occurrences of the phrase \"upon the face of all the earth\" in Genesis outside the Flood story (Genesis 1:29; 11:4, 8, 9), it clearly has the universal sense of the entire land surface of the globe, and there is nothing in the Flood narrative to indicate any less universality. (It should be also noted that the one place in Genesis where in context a similar phrase \"upon all the face of the earth\" is not universal [the famine mentioned in Genesis 41:56], the Hebrew has a change in word order from elsewhere in Genesis [\u00ccal-kol pen\u00ea ha\u00c9ares]).\n Third, the phrase \"face of the ground\" pen\u00ea ha\u00c9adamah (five times in the Flood narrative, 7:4, 22, 23; 8:8, 13), occurs in parallel with universal terms we have just noted, \"the earth\" (7:23) and \"face of all the earth\" (8:9); and this phrase \"face of the ground\" likewise harks back to its first usage in the universal context of creation (Genesis 2:6).\n Fourth, the term kol-basar \"all flesh\" occurs 12 times in Genesis 6-9 (Genesis 6:12, 13, 17, 19; 7:16, 21; 8:17; 9:11, 15, 16, 17). The word kol \"all\" (which can occasionally express less than totality if the context demands), before an indeterminate noun with no article or possessive suffix, as here in Genesis 6-9, indicates totality. God's announcement to destroy \"all flesh\" (Genesis 6:13, 17) and the narrator's comment that \"all flesh\" died (Genesis 7:21-22), except the inhabitants of the ark, indicates universal destruction. The one occurrence of kol plus the determinate noun ha basar \"all the flesh\" (in Genesis 7:15) likewise indicates totality as well as unity.\n Fifth, the expression \"every living thing\" (kol-hahay) of all flesh (Genesis 6:19), is another expression of totality; in 7:4, 23, the similar term kol-hayeq\u00fbm means literally, \"all existence.\" This term is given further universal dimensions by the addition of the clause harking back to creation - \"all existence that I have made\" (7:4) - and by the exclusive statement \"Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive\" (7:23). As Hasel puts it:\n \n There is hardly any stronger way in Hebrew to emphasize total destruction of 'all existence' of human and animal life on earth than the way it has been expressed. The writer of the Genesis Flood story employed terminology, formulae, and syntactical structures of the type that could not be more emphatic and explicit in expressing his concept of a universal, world-wide flood (Hasel 1975, p 86).\n \n Sixth, the phrase \"under the whole heaven\" (tahat kol-ha\u009a\u009aamayim, Genesis 7:19), is used six times in the OT outside of the Flood narrative, and always with a universal meaning (see Deuteronomy 2:25; 4:19; Job 28:24; 37:3; 41:11; Daniel 9:12). For example, the phrase is used to describe God's omniscience: \"For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heavens\" (Job 28:24). Again, it depicts God's sovereignty: \"Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine\" (Job 41:11 KJV). (Note that the usage in Deuteronomy 2:25, describing \"the nations under the whole heaven,\" is further qualified and limited by the phrase \"who shall hear the report of you,\" and thus is potentially universal and not an exception to the universal sense.)\n The universal phrase \"under the whole heaven\" or \"under all the heavens\" also universalizes the phrase \"under heaven\" (Genesis 6:17) in this same Flood context. The word \"heaven\" alone can have a local meaning [e.g., 1 Kings 18:45], but here the context is clearly universal. Ecclesiastes, which contains numerous allusions to creation, likewise utilizes the term \"under heaven\" with a universal intention (Ecclesiastes 1:13; 2:3; 3:1; cf. the parallel universal expression \"under the sun\" in Ecclesiastes 1:3, 9; 2:11, 17; etc.).\n In the Flood account this phrase \"under the whole heaven\" is part of two forceful verses describing the extent of the Flood: \"and the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered. The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered\" (7:19, 20). Critical scholar John Skinner notes that 7:19, 20 \"not only asserts its [the flood's] universality, but so to speak proves it, by giving the exact height of the waters above the highest mountains\" (Skinner 1930/1956, p 165).\n The biblical language here simply cannot be explained in terms of a local sky, and certainly cannot refer to the local mountains being covered by snow, as some proponents of a local flood suggest. H.C. Leupold points out that the writer of vs. 19 is not content with a single use of kol (\"all\") in \"all the high mountains,\" but \"since 'all' is known to be used in a relative sense, the writer removes all possible ambiguity by adding the phrase 'under all the heavens.' A double 'all' (kol) cannot allow for so relative a sense. It almost constitutes a Hebrew superlative. So we believe that the text disposes of the question of the universality of the Flood\" (Leupold 1942, p 301-302).\n Seventh, Hasel devoted an entire scholarly article to the phrase \"all the fountains [ma\u00ccyenoth] of the Great Deep [teh\u00f4m rabbah]\" (Genesis 7:11; 8:2), and showed how it is linked with the universal \"Deep\" (teh\u00f4m) or world-ocean in Genesis 1:2 (cf. Psalm 104:6: \"Thou didst cover it [the earth] with deep [teh\u00f4m] as with a garment; the waters were standing above the mountains\"). The \"breaking up\" and \"bursting forth\" (i.e., geological faulting) of not just one subterranean water spring in Mesopotamia, but of all the \"fountains\" of the Great Deep, coupled in the same verse with the opening of the windows of the heavens, far transcends a local scene. Hasel perceptively concludes that \"the bursting forth of the waters from the fountains of the 'great deep' refers to the splitting open of springs of subterranean waters with such might and force that together with the torrential downpouring of waters stored in the atmospheric heavens a worldwide flood comes about\" (Hasel 1974, p 71).\n Eighth, in another article, Hasel (1978) shows how the Hebrew Bible reserved a special term mabb\u00fbl which in its 13 occurrences refers exclusively to the universal Genesis Flood (12 occurrences in Genesis, once in Psalm 29: 10). This word may be derived from the Hebrew root ybl \"to flow, to stream.\" The term mabb\u00fbl, which in the Flood narrative is usually associated with mayim \"waters,\" seems to have become \"a technical term for waters flowing or streaming forth and as such designates the flood (deluge) being caused by waters. ... mabb\u00fbl is in the Old Testament a term consistently employed for the flood (deluge) which was caused by torrential rains and the bursting forth of subterranean waters\" (Hasel 1978, p 92-93). This technical term clearly sets the Genesis Deluge apart from all local floods, and is utilized in the Psalm 29:10 to illustrate Yahweh's universal sovereignty over the world at the time of the Noahic Flood: \"The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood, and the Lord sits as King forever.\"\n Summarizing regarding the technical terminology used for the extent of the Flood in Genesis 6-9, Hasel writes: \n \n The Genesis flood narrative provides ample evidence of being an account which is to be understood as a historical narrative in prose style. It expects to be taken literally. There is a consistent and overwhelming amount of terminology and formulae ... which on the basis of context and syntax has uniformly indicated that the flood story wants to be understood in a universal sense: the waters destroyed all human and animal plus bird life on the entire land mass of the globe. To read it otherwise means to force a meaning on the carefully written and specific syntactical constructions of the original language which the text itself rejects (Hasel 1975, p 87).\n \n III. Other Biblical Evidence for a Universal Flood\n \n Many additional lines of biblical evidence converge in affirming the universal extent of the Flood and also reveal the theological significance of this conclusion. We will summarize fourteen points that emerge from the biblical text.\n First, the trajectory of major themes in Genesis 1-11 - Creation, Fall, plan of redemption, spread of sin - is universal in scope and calls for a corresponding universal judgment. We have already noted in reference to specific Flood terminology the numerous allusions to the universal context of creation. The creation of \"the heavens and the earth\" certainly is not local in scope according to Genesis 1-2.\n Likewise, the Fall of humanity in Adam and Eve led to the sinful condition of the entire human race (ha\u00c9dam), not just the inhabitants of Mesopotamia (see Genesis 6:5, 11; Romans 3:19; 5:12). Again, the Protoevangelium (first Gospel promise) outlined in Genesis 3:15, involves the universal moral struggle between the spiritual descendants (or \"seed\") of the serpent and the spiritual descendants (\"seed\") of the woman, culminating in the victory of the representative Messianic Seed over the serpent (see Robertson 1980). This plan of redemption is certainly universal in scope.\n In a similar way, the sinful condition of humankind described at the time of the Flood includes more than those living in the Fertile Crescent. From God's perspective, not simply from the culturally conditioned local view of the narrator, we have the results of the divine investigative judgment: \"And God saw that the wickedness of man (ha\u00c9dam, humankind) was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually\" (Genesis 6:5). Such universal sinfulness naturally calls for universal judgment.\n Second, the divine purpose given for the bringing of the Flood makes explicit its universal scope: \"And the Lord said, 'I will destroy man [(ha\u00c9dam), humanity] whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them\" (Genesis 6:7). Nothing less than a complete destruction of the human race (except for Noah, 6:8) seems envisaged. Given the length of time from creation (over 1650 years minimum), the longevity of the antediluvians (nearly a thousand years), and God's command at creation to \"fill the earth\" (Genesis 1:28), it is highly unlikely that the pre-Flood population would have stayed only in Mesopotamia. Thus the destruction of humanity would necessitate more than a local Flood.\n Third, the genealogical lines from both Adam (Genesis 4:17-26; 5:1-31) and Noah (Genesis 10:1-32; 11:1-9) are exclusive in nature, indicating that as Adam was father of all pre-Flood humanity, so Noah was father of all post-Flood humanity. From the descendants of Noah \"the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood\" (Genesis 10: 32), and the Tower of Babel experience spreads humanity across the globe (Genesis 11:1-19).\n Striking extra-biblical evidence that all human races, and not just the nations of the Fertile Crescent, are included in the descendants of Noah, and retain memory of the universal Flood, is found in the amazing prevalence of ancient flood stories throughout the world. Over 230 different flood stories are known and occur among the most diverse peoples of the earth (see Frazer 1918, 1:105-361; Nelson 1931). A world-wide flood is by far the most frequently-given cause for past universally destructive calamities in the folk literature of antiquity (Thompson 1955, 1:182-194).\n A remarkable number of these oral and written traditions agree upon the basic points of the biblical account: all humankind was destroyed by a great flood as a result of divine judgment against human sin, and a single man and his family or a few friends survived the deluge in a ship or other sea-faring vessel. The stories nearest to the area of the Dispersion at Babel are the closest in detail to the biblical account (see Heidel 1946, Jacobsen 1981, and Lambert and Millard 1969). This vast body of ancient witnesses to a world-wide Deluge is powerful testimony to the historicity and universality of the biblical Flood.\n Fourth, the same inclusive divine blessing to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth is given to both Adam and Noah (Genesis 1:28; 9:1). This is another linkage between universal creation and the flood, between the original beginning and the \"new beginning.\" As the human race at creation flows from Adam and Eve, so the postdiluvial humanity is populated through Noah.\n Fifth, the covenant (Genesis 9:9-10) with its rainbow sign (Genesis 9:12-17) is clearly linked to the extent of the Flood, and includes the whole earth (Genesis 9:13-17). If there was only a local flood, then the covenant would be only a limited covenant, and the rainbow sign of \"the all-embracing universality of the Divine mercy\" (Delitzsch 1888/1976, 1:289-290) would be stripped of its meaning.\n Sixth, the viability of God's promise (Genesis 9:15; cf. Isaiah 54:9) and the integrity of God in keeping His promise is wrapped up in the world-wide extent of the Flood. This point cannot be underscored too heavily: if Genesis 6-9 describes only a local flood, then God has broken His promise every time another local flood has happened! The only way God's promise not to send another flood to destroy every living thing (Genesis 8:21) can be seen to have been kept is if the Flood was a universal one and the whole human race outside the ark was destroyed.\n Seventh, the universality of the Flood is underscored by the enormous size of the ark detailed in Genesis 6:14-15 and the stated necessity for saving all the kinds of animals and plants in the ark (Genesis 6:16-21; 7:2-3). A massive ark filled with representatives of all non-aquatic animal/plant kinds would be unnecessary if this were only a local flood, for these kinds could have been preserved elsewhere in the world. Yet the divine insistence in the biblical record is that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve representatives of all of the various kinds (Genesis 6:19-20).\n As a matter of fact, if only a local flood were in view, the building of any ark at all, even for Noah and his family, would have been superfluous - God could simply have warned Noah and his family in time to escape from the coming judgment, just as he did with Lot in Sodom. But the point of the narrative concerning the ark is that there was no other escape; in the midst of the Flood \"only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained\" (Genesis 7:23).\n Eighth, the covering of \"all the high mountains\" by at least 15 cubits (Genesis 7:19-20) could not involve simply a local flood, since water seeks its own level across the surface of the globe. Even one high mountain covered in a local Mesopotamian setting would require that same height of water everywhere on the planet's surface.\n In this connection we note that it is not necessary to postulate the existence of mountains as high as Mt. Everest at the time of the Flood, and thus to require waters covering the earth to a depth of six miles, as some proponents of a local flood suggest would be necessary (see Ramm 1954, p 242). The antediluvian mountains were very possibly much lower than at present. Passages in the book of Job and Psalms may well be referring to the process of postdiluvian mountain uplift (see Job 9:5; 28:9; and Psalm 104:7-8).\n Also in this connection we may address the objection that proponents of a local flood often raise, namely, that a world-wide Flood would imply \"that the earth's surface was completely renovated during the flood year\" and thus \"prediluvian topography would have been exceedingly different from postdiluvian topography.\" This implication, they claim, is in conflict with biblical evidence which \"strongly suggests that prediluvian geography did basically resemble postdiluvian geography\" (Young 1977, p 210). Reference is made particularly to the topographical descriptions in connection with the Garden of Eden: the lands of Havilah and Cush, and the four rivers, two of which (the Tigris and the Euphrates) were familiar to the readers of Genesis in Moses' time.\n What is not recognized in these arguments, however, is that although there are some similarities between the prediluvian and postdiluvian topography, there are more differences than similarities. Two of the rivers mentioned apparently no longer existed in Moses' time: the Pishon and Gihon are mentioned in terms of where they used to flow, in the postdiluvian areas of Havilah and Cush respectively. The other two rivers - the Tigris and Euphrates - are described as coming from a common source in the Garden of Eden, certainly far different from their present courses. Thus the topographical descriptions in the early chapters of Genesis are in harmony with a world-wide Flood. Also, it is likely that survivors of the Flood would use familiar names for topographical features after the Flood, even though the earth's surface looked entirely different.\n Ninth, the duration of the Flood makes sense only with a universal flood. The Deluge of rain from above and water from the fountains of the deep below continued 40 days (Genesis 7:17), and all the highest mountains were still covered five months after the Flood began; the tops of the mountains were not seen until after seven months, and the Flood waters were not dried up enough for Noah to leave the ark until one year and ten days had passed (see Genesis 7:11; 8:14). Such lengths of time seem commensurate only with a universal and not a local flood.\n Tenth, the receding activity of the water (Genesis 8:3a, 54a) is described by Hebrew phrases which, in parallel with similar phraseology and grammatical construction for the \"to and fro\" motion of the raven (Genesis 8:7), should be translated as \"going and retreating,\" (see Austin 1990, p 218; Hasel 1978, p 93) and imply oscillatory water motion lasting for 74 days (see Genesis 8:3-5). The waters rushing back and forth like in ocean tidal movement as the overall level gradually decreased, supports a universal interpretation such as \"the oceanic energy impulse model of the flood\" (Austin 1990, p 218), but is incongruous with a local flood theory.\n Eleventh, the NT passages concerning the Flood all employ universal language: \"swept them all away\" (Matthew 24:39); \"destroyed them all,\" (Luke 17:27); \"he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven other persons, ... when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly\" (2 Peter 2:5); \"a few, that is eight persons, were saved through water\" (1 Peter 3:20); Noah \"condemned the world\" (Hebrews 11:7). A local flood would not have ended the antediluvian world. As Archer states, \"we have the unequivocal corroboration of the New Testament that the destruction of the human race at the time of the flood was total and universal\" (Archer 1985, p 208).\n Twelfth, the NT Flood typology assumes and depends upon not only the historicity, but also the universality, of the Flood to theologically argue for an imminent world-wide judgment by fire (2 Peter 3:6-7). Peter argues that just as there was a world-wide judgment by water causing the unbelieving antediluvian world to perish, so in the antitype there must-needs-be a universal end-time judgment by fire bringing about the destruction of the ungodly (see Davidson 1981, p 326-327).\n Thirteenth, key terms and motifs that we have already noted in Genesis 6-9 converge to make a major theological statement: the Noahic Flood is nothing less than the cosmic undoing or reversal of creation. Numerous biblical scholars have recognized this highly significant theological point of the Flood narrative. Nahum Sarna writes that \"The Flood is a cosmic catastrophe that is actually the undoing of creation.\" In other words, creation is being undone, and the world returned to chaos (Sarna 1989, p 48).\n Tikva Frymer-Kensky describes the Flood as \"the original, cosmic undoing of creation\" (Frymer-Kensky 1983, p 410; cf. Frymer-Kensky 1985, p 312). Claus Westermann speaks of the \"invasion of chaos into the created order; the flood assumed cosmic proportions\" (Westermann 1974/1984, p 434). Umberto Cassuto points out that at the high point of the Flood, \"We see water everywhere, as though the world had reverted to its primeval state at the dawn of Creation, when the waters of the Deep submerged everything\" (Cassuto 1964, p 97). David Clines uses the apt term bouleversement or \"reversal\" of creation to depict the theological significance of the Flood (Clines 1972, p 136). For Joseph Blenkinsopp, \n \n ... the deluge is an act of uncreation, undoing the work of separation by returning everything to the primeval, watery chaos from which the created order first arose (Blenkinsopp 1992, p 83; cf. Blenkinsopp 1971, p 46-47).\n \n Gerhard von Rad vividly underscores the universal implications of this undoing or reversal of creation: \n \n ... we must understand the Flood, therefore, as a catastrophe involving the entire cosmos. When the heavenly ocean breaks forth upon the earth below, and the primeval sea beneath the earth, which is restrained by God, now freed from its bonds, gushes up through yawning chasms onto the earth, then there is a destruction of the entire cosmic system according to biblical cosmology. The two halves of the chaotic primeval sea, separated - the one up, the other below - by God's creative government (ch. 1:7-9), are again united; creation begins to sink into chaos. Here the catastrophe, therefore, concerns not only men and beasts ... but the earth (chs. 6.13; 9.1) - indeed, the entire cosmos (von Rad 1972, p 128).\n \n Only a cosmic/universal Flood can theologically encompass the cosmic/universal reversal or undoing of creation described in Genesis 6-9.\n Fourteenth and last, the cosmic reversal of creation is followed by a cosmic New Beginning. As Clines states it: \n \n ... the 'uncreation' which God has worked with the Flood is not final; creation has not been permanently undone. Old unities of the natural world are restored (8:22), and the old ordinances of creation are renewed (9:1-7) (Clines 1972-73, p 138).\n \n Jacques Doukhan has shown the precise literary parallels between the successive stages of \"re-creation\" in the aftermath of the Flood (Genesis 8-9) and the seven days of creation in Genesis 1-2 (Doukhan 1987, p 133-134; cf. Gage 1984, p 10-20): \n \n The wind over the earth and waters. Gen. 8:1; cf. Gen. 1:2. \n Division of waters. Gen. 8:1-5; cf. Gen. 1:6-8. \n Appearance of plants. Gen. 8:6-12; cf. Gen. 1:9-13. \n Appearance of light. Gen. 8:13-14; cf. Gen. 1:14-19. \n Deliverance of animals. Gen. 8:15-17; cf. Gen. 1:20-23. \n Animals together with men, blessing, food for men, image of God. Gen. 8:18-9:7; cf. Gen. 1:24-31. \n Sign of covenant. Gen. 9:8-17; cf. Gen. 2:1-3. \n Thus in the over-arching literary structure of the \"re-creation\" in the Flood narrative, the universal dimension of the Flood is underscored by detailed parallels with the cosmic creation account of Genesis 1-2.\n \n IV. Conclusion\n \n In conclusion, the question of the extent of the Genesis Flood is not just a matter of idle curiosity with little at stake for Christian faith. For those who see the days of creation in Genesis 1 as six, literal 24-hour days (see Hasel 1994), a universal Flood is an absolute necessity to explain the existence of the geologic column. A literal creation week is inextricably linked with a world-wide flood.\n But a universal Flood is crucial not only in seeking to reconcile science and Scripture. It is also pivotal in understanding and remaining faithful to the theology of Genesis 1-11 and the rest of Scripture. (For a more detailed discussion of the theology of the Genesis Flood in its canonical context, see Davidson in press.) The many links with the universal creation in Genesis 1-2 which we have noted in this study not only support the aspect of universality in the Flood, but serve to theologically connect Protology (Creation) and Eschatology (Judgment/Salvation) in the opening chapters of Scripture. The Flood is an eschatological step-by-step \"uncreation\" of the world and humanity followed by a step-by-step \"re-creation\" of the new world. \"Thus,\" writes von Rad, \"the story of the Flood - and this is theologically the most important fact - shows an eschatological world judgment.... The world judgment of the Flood hangs like an iron curtain between this world age and that of the first splendor of creation\" (von Rad 1972, p 129-130).\n The theology of the universal Flood is therefore the pivot of a connected but multi-faceted universal theme running through Genesis 1-11 and constituting an over-arching pattern for the entire subsequent world-wide creation revealing the character of the Creator and His original purpose for creation; humankind's turning from the Creator and the universal spread of sin ending in the universal \"uncreation\" through eschatological judgment; and re-creation, in the eschatological salvation of the faithful covenant remnant and the universal renewal of the earth.\n ",

Now you know as well as I that at the time in history being discussed, these civilizations had absolutely no contact or even knowledge of each others existence for the most part.\n \n There are hundreds of flood myths from around the world. A great many of them are caused by a god's decision to punish sinful humans. In a few cases, the flood is a god's attempt to save the earth due to overpopulation. Overwhelmingly, no matter the reason for the flood, the outcome is that the world is fresh and new again, and people have the chance to start over. \n \n \n Perhaps people today have been \"missing the boat!\" People put the emphasis on the wrong part of the story; instead of talking about wickedness and punishment, we should concentrate on being refreshed, being reborn, and starting over! \n \n \n Here are flood myths from around the globe. Check out the last one from South Brazil...it gives a whole new spin on Darwin and his Theory of Evolution! \n \n \n \n European: \n \n \n Greek: Zeus sent a flood to destroy the men of the Bronze Age. Prometheus advised his son Deucalion to build a chest. All other men perished except for a few who escaped to high mountains. Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha (daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora), after floating in the chest for nine days and nights, landed on Parnassus. When the rains ceased, he sacrificed to Zeus, the God of Escape. At the bidding of Zeus, he threw stones over his head; they became men, and the stones which Pyrrha threw became women. That is why people are called laoi, from laas, \"a stone.\" (The Roman story is very similar.)\n \n \n Celtic: Heaven and Earth were great giants, and Heaven lay upon the Earth so that their children were crowded between them, and the children and their mother were unhappy in the darkness. The boldest of the sons led his brothers in cutting up Heaven into many pieces. From his skull they made the firmament. His spilling blood caused a great flood which killed all humans except a single pair, who were saved in a ship made by a beneficent Titan.\n \n \n Welsh: The lake of Llion burst, flooding all lands. Dwyfan and Dwyfach escaped in a mastless ship with pairs of every sort of living creature. They landed in Prydain (Britain) and repopulated the world. \n \n \n Lithuanian: From his heavenly window, the supreme god Pramzimas saw nothing but war and injustice among mankind. He sent two giants, Wandu and Wejas (water and wind), to destroy earth. After twenty days and nights, little was left. Pramzimas looked to see the progress. He happened to be eating nuts at the time, and he threw down the shells. One happened to land on the peak of the tallest mountain, where some people and animals had sought refuge. Everybody climbed in and survived the flood floating in the nutshell. God's wrath abated, he ordered the wind and water to abate. The people dispersed, except for one elderly couple who stayed where they landed. To comfort them, God sent the rainbow and advised them to jump over the bones of the earth nine times. They did so, and up sprang nine other couples, from which the nine Lithuanian tribes descended. \n \n \n \n Transylvanian Gypsy: One day, and old man came to the country and asked for a night's lodging, which a couple gave him in their cottage. When he departed the next day, he said he would return in nine days. He gave his host a small fish in a vessel and said he would reward the host if he did not eat the fish but returned it then. The wife thought the fish must be exceptionally good to eat, but the husband said he had promised the old man to keep it and made the woman swear not to eat it. After two days of thinking about it, though, the wife yielded to temptation and threw the fish on the hot coals. Immediately, she was struck dead by lightning, and it began to rain. The rivers started overflowing the country. On the ninth day, the old man returned and told his host that all living things would be drowned, but since he had kept his oath, he would be saved. The old man told the host to take a wife, gather his kinfolk, and build a boat on which to save them, animals, and seeds of trees and herbs. The man did all this. It rained a year, and the waters covered everything. After a year, the waters sank, and the people and animals disembarked. \n \n \n \n Near East\n \n \n Sumerian: The gods had decided to destroy mankind. The god Enlil warned the priest-king Ziusudra (\"Long of Life\") of the coming flood by speaking to a wall while Ziusudra listened at the side. He was instructed to build a great ship and carry beasts and birds upon it. Violent winds came, and a flood of rain covered the earth for seven days and nights. Then Ziusudra opened a window in the large boat, allowing sunlight to enter, and he prostrated himself before the sun-god Utu. After landing, he sacrificed a sheep and an ox and bowed before Anu and Enlil. For protecting the animals and the seed of mankind, he was granted eternal life and taken to the country of Dilmun, where the sun rises.\n \n \n Babylonian: Three times (every 1200 years), the gods were distressed by the disturbance from human overpopulation. The gods dealt with the problem first by plague, then by famine. Both times, the god Enki advised men to bribe the god causing the problem. The third time, Enlil advised the gods to destroy all humans with a flood, but Enki had Atrahasis build an ark and so escape. Also on the boat were cattle, wild animals and birds, and Atrahasis' family. (The Assyrian version is very similar.)\n \n \n Chaldean: The god Chronos in a vision warned Xisuthrus, the tenth king of Babylon, of a flood coming on the fifteenth day of the month of Daesius. The god ordered him to write a history and bury it in Sippara, and told him to build and provision a vessel (5 stadia by 2 stadia) for himself, his friends and relations, and all kinds of animals. Xisuthrus asked where he should sail, and Chronos answered, \"to the gods, but first pray for all good things to men.\" Xisuthrus built a ship five furlongs by two furlongs and loaded it as ordered. After the flood had come and abated somewhat, he sent out some birds, which returned. Later, he tried again, and the birds returned with mud on their feet. On the third trial, the birds didn't return. He saw that land had appeared above the waters, so he parted some seams of his ship, saw the shore, and drove his ship aground in the Corcyraean mountains in Armenia. He disembarked with his wife, daughter, and pilot, and offered sacrifices to the gods. Those four were translated to live with the gods. \n \n \n Hebrew: God, upset at mankind's wickedness, resolved to destroy it, but Noah was righteous and found favor with Him. God told Noah to build an ark. Noah did so, and took aboard his family and pairs of all kinds of animals. For 40 days and nights, floodwaters came from the heavens and from the deeps, until the highest mountains were covered. The waters flooded the earth for 150 days; then God sent a wind and the waters receded, and the ark came to rest in Ararat. After 40 days, Noah sent out a raven, which kept flying until the waters had dried up. He next sent out a dove, which returned without finding a perch. A week later he set out the dove again, and it returned with an olive leaf. The next week, the dove didn't return. After a year and 10 days from the start of the flood, everyone and everything emerged from the ark. Noah sacrificed some clean animals and birds to God, and God, pleased with this, promised never again to destroy all living creatures with a flood, giving the rainbow as a sign of this covenant. Animals became wild and became suitable food, and Noah and his family were told to repopulate the earth. \n \n \n Africa\n \n \n Pygmy: Chameleon heard a strange noise, like water running, in a tree, but at that time there was no water in the world. He cut open the trunk, and water came out in a great flood that spread all over the earth. The first human couple emerged with the water.\n \n \n Bakongo (west Zaire): An old lady, weary and covered with sores, arrived in a town called Sonanzenzi and sought hospitality, which was denied her at all homes but the last she came to. When she was well and ready to depart, she told her friends to pack up and leave with her, as the place was accursed and would be destroyed by Nzambi. The night after they had left, heavy rains came and turned the valley into a lake, drowning all the inhabitants of the town. The sticks of the houses can still be seen deep in the lake.\n \n \n Yoruba (southwest Nigeria): A god, Ifa, tired of living on earth and went to dwell in the firmament with Obatala. Without his assistance, mankind couldn't interpret the desires of the gods, and one god, Olokun, in a fit of rage, destroyed nearly everybody in a great flood. \n \n \n Mandingo (Ivory Coast): A charitable man gave away everything he had to the animals. His family deserted him, but when he gave his last meal to the (unrecognized) god Ouende, Ouende rewarded him with three handfuls of flour which renewed itself and produced even greater riches. Then Ouende advised him to leave the area, and sent six months of rain to destroy his selfish neighbors. The descendants of the rich man became the present human race.\n \n \n Asia\n \n \n Yenisey-Ostyak (north central Siberia): Flood waters rose for seven days. Some people and animals were saved by climbing on floating logs and rafters. A strong north wind blew for seven days and scattered the people, which is why there are now different peoples speaking different languages. \n \n \n Tuvinian (Soyot) (north of Mongolia): The giant frog (or turtle) which supported the earth moved, which caused the cosmic ocean to begin flooding the earth. An old man who had guessed something like this would happen built an iron-reinforced raft, boarded it with his family, and was saved. When the waters receded, the raft was left on a high wooded mountain, where, it is said, it remains today. After the flood, Kezer-Tshingis-Kaira-Khan created everything around us. \n \n \n Hindu: Manu, the first human, found a small fish in his washwater. The fish begged protection from the larger fishes, in return for which it would save Manu. Manu kept the fish safe, transferring it to larger and larger reservoirs as it grew, eventually taking it to the ocean. The fish warned Manu of a coming deluge and told him to build a ship. When the flood rose, the fish came, and Manu tied the craft to its horn. The fish led him to a northern mountain and told Manu to tie the ship's rope to a tree to prevent it from drifting. Manu, alone of all creatures, survived. He made offerings of clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. From these, a woman arose, calling herself Manu's daughter. Whatever blessings he invoked through her were granted him. Through her, he generated this race.\n \n \n Tibet: Tibet was almost totally inundated, until the god Gya took compassion on the survivors, drew off the waters through Bengal, and sent teachers to civilize the people, who until then had been little better than monkeys. Those people repopulated the land.\n \n \n Lolo (southwestern China): In primeval times, men were wicked. The patriarch Tse-gu-dzih sent a messenger down to earth, asking for some flesh and blood from a mortal. Only one man, Du-mu, complied. In wrath, Tse-gu-dzih locked the rain-gates, and the waters mounted to the sky. Du-mu was saved in a log hollowed out of a Pieris tree, together with his four sons and otters, wild ducks, and lampreys. The civilized peoples who can write are descended from the sons; the ignorant races are descendants of wooden figures whom Du-mu constructed after the deluge.\n \n \n Miao (Hmong) (southern China, north Thailand, Laos): After people had lived on the earth for 9,000 years, two brothers noticed that someone was coming at night and undoing everything they had done in the field in the day. They laid in wait and saw an old man filling their furrows. The elder brother wanted to kill him, but the younger brother said they should first question him for his reason. The old man said their work was futile because a flood would soon come. The brothers realized the man was the Lord of the Sky and asked him what they should do. He told the elder, violent-tempered brother to build an iron boat and the younger brother to build a wooden boat and to take his sister, males and females of each animal species, and two seeds of each species of plant. In the seventh month rain fell for four days and nights. The iron boat sank, but the wooden boat floated up to the sky. Seeing the earth flooded, the Lord of the Sky sent a dragon in the shape of a rainbow to dry it. The brother wanted to marry his sister, but she resisted. But after various tests proved it was the will of the Lord of the Sky, they married. Their child had no head or limbs. Thinking it was an egg, they cut it open. It contained no child, but the pieces became people when they fell to earth. By cutting it into the smallest possible pieces, they created innumerable children and repopulated the earth. \n \n \n Australia \n \n \n Narrinyeri (South Australia): A man's two wives ran away from him. He pursued them to Encounter Bay, saw them at a distance, and angrily cried out for the waters to rise and drown them. A terrible flood washed over the hills and killed the two women. The waters rose so high that a man named Nepelle, who lived at Rauwoke, had to drag his canoe to the top of the hill now called Point Macleay. The dense part of the Milky Way shows his canoe floating in the sky.\n \n \n Victoria: Bunjil, the creator, was angry with people because of the evil they did, so he caused the ocean to flood by urinating into it. All people were destroyed except those whom Bunjil loved and fixed as stars in the sky, and a man and a woman who climbed a tall tree on a mountain, and from whom the present human race is descended.\n \n \n North, Central, and South America \n \n \n Norton Sound Eskimo: In the first days, the water from the sea came up and flooded all the earth except for a very high mountain in the middle. A few animals escaped to this mountain, and a few people survived in a boat, subsisting on fish. The people landed on the mountain as the water subsided and followed the retreating water to the coast. The animals also descended.\n \n \n Kaska (northern inland British Columbia): A great flood came; people survived it on rafts and canoes. Darkness and high winds came, which scattered the vessels. When the flood subsided, people landed at the nearest land and lived where they had landed. Thus they were scattered all over the world, and when they met again long afterwards, they were different tribes and spoke different languages.\n \n \n Shasta (northern California interior): Coyote encountered an evil water spirit who said, \"There is no wood\" and caused water to rise until it covered Coyote. After the water receded, Coyote shot the water spirit with a bow and ran away, but the water followed him. He ran to the top of Mount Shasta; the water followed but didn't quite reach the top. Coyote made a fire, and all the other animal people swam to it and found refuge there. After the water receded, they came down, made new homes, and became the ancestors of all the animal people today.\n \n \n Michoacan (Mexico): When the flood waters began to rise, a man named Tezpi entered into a great vessel, taking with him his wife and children and diverse seeds and animals. When the waters abated, the man sent out a vulture, but the bird found plenty of corpses to eat and didn't return. Other birds also flew away and didn't return. Finally, he sent out a hummingbird, which returned with a green bough in its beak.\n \n \n Macusi (British Guyana): The good spirit Makunaima (\"He who works in the night\") created the heaven and earth. When he had created plants and trees, he came down from his heavenly mansion, climbed a tree, and chipped off bark with a large stone axe. The chips turned into animals of all kinds when they fell into the river at the base of the tree. Next, Makunaima created man, and after the man had fallen asleep, he awoke to find a woman beside him. Later the evil spirit got more power on earth, so Makunaima sent a great flood. Only one man survived in a canoe. He sent a rat to see whether the flood had abated, and the rat returned with a cob of maize. When the flood had subsided, the man threw stones behind him, which became other people. \n \n \n Coroado (south Brazil): A flood once covered the whole earth except for the top of the coastal range Serra do Mar. Members of the three tribes Coroados, Cayurucres, and Cames, swam for the mountains holding lighted torches between their teeth. The Cayurucres and Cames wearied and drowned, and their souls went to dwell in the heart of the mountain. The Coroados made it and stayed there, some on the ground and some in the branches of trees. Several days passed without food and without the water lowering. Then some saracuras, a species of waterfowl, flew to them with baskets of earth. The birds began throwing the earth into the water, and the water sank. The people urged the birds to hurry, so the birds called the ducks to help them. When the flood subsided, the Coroados descended, except for the ones which had climbed into trees, who became monkeys. \n \n \n \n If you would like to read more and different flood myths from around the world, visit Flood Stories from Around the World compiled by Mark Isaak.

   "Just think, thousands of years ago in all corners of the Earth, different peoples of different Cultures who had no contact with each other all recorded a massive flood story. An amazing example of mass delusions on a World wide scale huh. \n\n \n Well, none of those myths have much in common, except of course, they were made by cultures that congregated around rivers. In case you haven't noticed, rivers flood. Sometimes, there is a bigger flood than others.\n \n Take a look at videos of some of the mississippi floods",

   "Listen up. \n Human beings are self hypnotic creatures. There is NO \"debate\" over creation and evolution. There are just those (many) who use the oh so human ability to dissociate their beliefs from reality. The fact that our minds are capable of dissociation is obvious to ANYONE who has ever been hypnotised or seen a stage hypnotist. Some people are clearly more susceptible than others. It is easy to test for this. It is no coincidence that people highly susceptible to hypnotic suggestion are also, far more often than not, \"highly religious\". \n To accomplish \"dissociation\" is not hard. All it takes is a willing person and a decent \"inductive\" technique. Many cultures have used repetitive and monotonous drumming, painful body positioning, powerful and monotonous voices, smells, colors, music, awe inspiring places or buildings, light (as in staring at a flame), following a moving object...... the list is long.\n The Roman Catholic Church, you will recall, took a nosedive in attendance when they foolishly abandoned their classic inductive mass in favor of a new mass that eliminated the age old technique of Latin, incense, up-down-up-down, kneeling, statement/answer/statement/answer..... and all the rest.\n The new Mega-Churches use classic and powerful inductive techniques. Any person trained in hypnotism will tell you that the power of the induction, and therefor the dissociation, is directly dependant upon the size of the audience. The bigger the better and more effective. \n There is really NO limit to what you can get a willing person to believe. We desperately WANT answers. Our minds are hard wired to ALWAYS put an effect together with a cause. If we don't know the cause.... we make one up, or accept what someone else has made up. It is a survival trait that has held people in advantageous groups for hundreds of thousands of years.\n Now, if you have a problem understanding what any of this has to do with religion (creation/evolution) consider this. With a willing subject and a proper inductive technique we can easilly \"insert\" a dissociative \"filter\" that effectively STOPS reality from ever reaching the level of consciousness. It happens every day. We can stop pain, create pain, convince people they are someone else, cause them to feel true and real emotions, make them blind, deaf or act like CHICKENS. \n But, it doesn't last. UNLESS it is \"reinforced. With religion the reinforcement is the demand that Church/Temple... is attended regularly. The really successful religions attempt to expose the member as much and as often as possible and in as many ways as possible. The extreme being a \"cult\" where the person never really ever gets out.\n This is precisely WHY it is as useless to attempt to convince a \"Creationist\" that their explanation of the Universe is absurd as it is to attempt to convince a person who \"believes\" they are a Chicken that they clearly are not. It is pointless because dissociative behavior is not only HOW the human mind deals with questions that have no answers..... but quite frankly.... the ONLY way most people can.\n It is comforting, it completes a picture for us, it puts nagging questions to rest, it enables us to enjoy the security of a group, it gives us ANSWERS to teach our children.\n The only problem is, we will fight, harm and even kill others who question our answers. [see: HISTORY] \n People who see Evolution as a successful theory of explaining the marvelous relationship of all life on this small planet do not mistake it to be \"an end\". It is clearly a beginning, a \"work in progress\" as ALL theories are. These people see the unfolding mystery as far more thrilling and profound than a story that it is forbidden to question. ANY story, no matter how popular or beautiful.\n So don't waste your time! They think they are Chickens because they desperately WANT to think they are Chickens. It's OK.\n If you REALLY want a learning experience.... get a book on \"Hypnotic Technique\" at the highest or most complicated level you can understand. Then, after you have learned \"how\" it is done.... tune in John Hagee or Jerry Falwell on a Sunday morning and observe. Any successful TV preacher will do, but, the above mentioned are masters of inductive technique. I promise, it will be a REAL eye opener.\n NOTE! As I have stated many times..... THIS IS NORMAL HUMAN BEHAVIOR! I make NO value judgements or in any way seek to suggest that religious people are in any way less intelligent of thoughtful than non-religious people. It is just, quite simply, HOW our brains evolved.",

   "\n And untill you respond to my points such as bringing juveniles and babies on board, I see no reason to deal with your weak reasons why it was impossible for the Ark to float. But just for fun, here is some evidence that actually considers the facts as stated in the Word of God.\n www.users.bigpond.com/rdoolan/arksize.html\n \n\n I have no problem with you claiming such a thing. They could conceivably fit \"juveniles and babies\" on board. However, since you claimed this, you must also show how they took care of all of the feeding (as they had to have brought food for all of these animals - while you're thinking of it, that was another thing they had to store), how they took care of the $hit that each animal produced, etc. Then you also have to explain whether or not they took sea animals (fish, etc.) If they did not, then you have to explain how these fish and such survived the flood, as many fish are very sensitive to the slightest change of salinity or pH (and pressure, etc.). If a flood is covering the entire surface of the earth, all of the fresh-water will be mixing with the salt-water, and those that live in the sea would die from the ifferent density, and those in fresh-water would die from that as well as the changes in salinity caused when they are mixed.\n \n I'm not saying it was the animals that made the ark unable to float, I am saying that the ark itself would have broken apart even if it was empty. The only way it could even have a chance of keeping together is if the entire internal space (where the animals should be going, at least according to the design given in the bible) was devoted entirely to internal supports.\n \n Here's a post I made on another thread concerning the ark: \n The titanic was a steel-hulled ship made of overlapping 1 inch thick plates, fastened by by millions of rivets. (I find it ironic that you mention the Titanic as an example of something that can float). The QM2 and all other ocean liners are also made of steel. A large wooden ship (as large as the ark) would break up. It is not due to the design. \n \n The basic limiting factor is the Modulus of Elasticity (stress/strain). Wood's limit tops out around 2,000,000 pounds per square inch. Steel is nearly 15 to 16 times that. With the weight of the cargo pushing down, and the water pressure pushing up, the wooden structure flexes 15 times as much as steel. The gaps between the planks would become huge, causing leaking and failure.\n \n Wood also absorbs water and loses strength. The nails fastening it together would undergo the flexing, creating holes that become wider and wider until they fall out. It might technically be possible to build a wooden ship as large as the ark, however, it would be filled entirely with internal structure to support it, and there would be no cargo space whatsoever.\n\n Go ahead and click the little arrow next to where it says my name in that quote to see the context of the argument (basically it was wildflowerneu making ignorant posts)\n \n \n \n The we get a bunch of c/ping from you:\n \n \nJust think, thousands of years ago in all corners of the Earth, different peoples of different Cultures who had no contact with each other all recorded a massive flood story. An amazing example of mass delusions on a World wide scale huh. www.fuchsiashockz.co.uk/articles/wonders/Biblical_flood_legends.php \n \n And here is an excerpt from the link at the bottom of this article about the different flood stories from all around the World. Now you know as well as I that at the time in history being discussed, these civilizations had absolutely no contact or even knowledge of each others existence for the most part.\n \n <snip< bunch of c/p'ed stuff<\n If you would like to read more and different flood myths from around the world, visit Flood Stories from Around the World compiled by Mark Isaak.

I also suggest you read the edit I made on the post you quoted.\n\n \n 1) As I said, by blood, I already have the blood of Abraham flowing through me. As a kid my parents best friends were jewish too so we have always naturally related. The hatred and bitterness that exists has existed from islam toward israel since Israel became a Nation, but I wasn't raised to hate anyone at all, ever, by my dad or mom.\n \n 2) I have no bloodlust for Iran, Iraq, or any other Islamic People. But I firmly believe in responding with equal force to those who don't follow the Internationally outlined rules of Warfare and target as many innocent civilians as possible thereby utilizing the tactics of Terrorism such as blending in with the civilian populations they sacrifice for their murderous agendas.\n \n Had we flattened Osama Bin Ladens Family compound/estate in Saudi Arabia where his parents, 54 siblings and hundreds of neices and nephews live in safety, we would have taken the War directly to him and allowed him to suffer the same losses he leveled on so many innocent families who never did anything to him. But NOOOOOO, we are too compassionate and civilized for that as he and his minions butcher our people by cutting their heads off with dull knives. So yes SP, since we are in a War for our very existence, I'm all for defending ourselves and taking the battle to our enemies. So sorry if that offends your sensibilities.\n \n \nI am also still waiting for your response to post#65.\n\n \n Nothing in 65 is worth responding to. It was a waste of time even reading it. When you build an Ark the size of Noah's based on the precise directions God gave him, and it breaks up and leaks as you claim, then I'll believe you. Until then, it's just so much faithless drivel from another unbeliever who can't see past his limited understanding. But thanks for trying.",

I'm a member of the Family of God, by Grace I am saved and not because I'm special or worthy, it is a free gift of Love from the Messiah who died for my sins.

   "Listen up. \n Human beings are self hypnotic creatures. There is NO \"debate\" over creation and evolution. There are just those (many) who use the oh so human ability to dissociate their beliefs from reality. The fact that our minds are capable of dissociation is obvious to ANYONE who has ever been hypnotised or seen a stage hypnotist. Some people are clearly more susceptible than others. It is easy to test for this. It is no coincidence that people highly susceptible to hypnotic suggestion are also, far more often than not, \"highly religious\". \n To accomplish \"dissociation\" is not hard. All it takes is a willing person and a decent \"inductive\" technique.

   "Welsh: The lake of Llion burst, flooding all lands. Dwyfan and Dwyfach escaped in a mastless ship with pairs of every sort of living creature. They landed in Prydain (Britain) and repopulated the world.\n\n Being 50% Welsh, I'll declare an interest here.\n \nDwyfan and Dwyfach: Cymric pseudo-deities only known from the version of the Trioedd Ynys Prydain 'improved' by Iolo Morgannwg. Edward Williams [1747-1826], more commonly known by his baridc name of Iolo Morgannwg was a stonemason by trade though he is probably better known as the greatest fantasist in Cymric history. He created the modern institution of the Gorsedd of Bards first held on Primrose Hill in London, 1792. He was an industrious academic and both collected and copied numerous ancient Cymric documents many of which have been verified as authentic. Unfortunatel he could not resist 'improving' other documents. He left a cottage full of documents and the question of their veracity has plagued academics ever since. It is known, however, that a full third of the Trioedd Ynys Prydain (the Welsh Triads) found in Iolo's own hand were of his own invention. The tale of Dwyfan and Dwyfach, along with other heroes such as Hu Gadarn fall into this category.\n\n http://www.celtnet.org.uk/gods_d/dwyfan_dwyfach.html\n \n The fact that people like Archie and his link authors are so ready to fall for this kind of pseudo-ancient drivel is a good measure of the intellectual rigour they apply to their 'research'. As to the other flood-myths quoted, the ANE ones form a linked set, while those from other continents (provenance not given) are wildly contradictory and in some cases apparently creation myths.

Some of us require a degree of reproducible evidence, some of us don't. That's how dissociation works.\n \n I feel bad for the guy. Being persecuted seems to be part of his need matrix. He sees racism all around, as if race has anything to do with it. It's part of what makes him real in his own eyes. But, you see, in \"the end\" he will triumph, so the more he feels persecuted the better it gets for him. It's classic!\n \n I totally misunderstood him. I assumed he was a kid. His talking about cars, dating and school threw me off. You don't usually see \"adults\" having to resort to their \"teenage accomplishments\" to impress people. It sez nothing about the \"man\" other than to affirm that not much has happened of any worth in a long time.\n \n Listen, if you ran into a schizophrenic on the street and he insisted that STOP signs contained secret speakers and transmitters that informed him, and others like him, of vital information that he MUST share with you...... would you take him seriously enough to engage him in a debate? Of course you wouldn't. And, of course he would get angry, warn you of your folly and go on to tell you of how he is persecuted. Would you NOT feel sorry for the guy? Would you really EXPECT him to play by the same rules as rational people? Of course you wouldn't! \n \n You also WOULD NOT expect to talk him out of his delusions. By attempting to do so you feed his need to have them. This is PRECISELY why humans have religions. Within them, at least, there is a degree of safety. A 'Safety valve\" if you will for those who need it. That is also why there is far less mental illness in the deeply religious community and in societies that are religious based. They have a place to fit. [example] Any teenager who straps TNT on himself to blow up as many people as he can who don't follow his beliefs would be rightly considered CRAZY in our society, right? Well, not in Baghdad!\n \n On the other hand, it appears that atheists have more incidence of obsessive compulsive disorder and other \"reality based\" maladies. Ritual, going hand in hand with religion, appears to be a human need. How does a brain evolved to ALWAYS match cause to effect continue to function in a world where the biggest and most important \"causes\" are, as of yet, unknown? [ANSWER]... Someone MAKES THEM UP! Then others join in with all their might thereby providing not only answers but the safety and security of numbers. A clear evolutionary advantage.\n \n The more one looks into this phenomena the more it appears that we \"evolved\" not only the tendancy.... but the need. And, when you add the growing mountain of evidence showing that particular religions have particular \"forms\" of mental illness or deviant behavior, the picture begins to clear. For example, anorexia nervosa is an American disease, almost exclusively to not only Western culture, but, girls who have grown up in a Catholic tradition. There are exceptions, of course, but hows that for a mind blower? There are dozens of mental illnesses that are specific to specific religions around the world.\n \n We know little of how the brain functions. Some people appear to function well with unanswered questions floating around in their head. Others CLEARLY do not! Condemning them for what appears to be folly to us is like is condemning them for being human. That's all they are emoticon_xangel \n \n [someone asked] Where can I read more on this..... I would suggest that you Google [Amazon books] and look at \"The Corruption of Reality\". It will lead you to a growing body of scientific literature.\n \n I would respectfully request that people refrain from the childlike tendancy to \"snitch\" to some administrative authority figure. Archie has every right to his beliefs, and his beliefs lead him to post as he posts. As the saying goes...... \"If you wrestle with a pig, two things are bound to happen. 1.

Some of us require a degree of reproducible evidence, some of us don't. That's how dissociation works.\n \n I feel bad for the guy. Being persecuted seems to be part of his need matrix. He sees racism all around, as if race has anything to do with it. It's part of what makes him real in his own eyes. But, you see, in \"the end\" he will triumph, so the more he feels persecuted the better it gets for him. It's classic!\n \n I totally misunderstood him. I assumed he was a kid. His talking about cars, dating and school threw me off. You don't usually see \"adults\" having to resort to their \"teenage accomplishments\" to impress people. It sez nothing about the \"man\" other than to affirm that not much has happened of any worth in a long time.\n \n Listen, if you ran into a schizophrenic on the street and he insisted that STOP signs contained secret speakers and transmitters that informed him, and others like him, of vital information that he MUST share with you...... would you take him seriously enough to engage him in a debate? Of course you wouldn't. And, of course he would get angry, warn you of your folly and go on to tell you of how he is persecuted. Would you NOT feel sorry for the guy? Would you really EXPECT him to play by the same rules as rational people? Of course you wouldn't! \n \n You also WOULD NOT expect to talk him out of his delusions. By attempting to do so you feed his need to have them. This is PRECISELY why humans have religions. Within them, at least, there is a degree of safety. A 'Safety valve\" if you will for those who need it. That is also why there is far less mental illness in the deeply religious community and in societies that are religious based. They have a place to fit. [example] Any teenager who straps TNT on himself to blow up as many people as he can who don't follow his beliefs would be rightly considered CRAZY in our society, right? Well, not in Baghdad!\n \n On the other hand, it appears that atheists have more incidence of obsessive compulsive disorder and other \"reality based\" maladies. Ritual, going hand in hand with religion, appears to be a human need. How does a brain evolved to ALWAYS match cause to effect continue to function in a world where the biggest and most important \"causes\" are, as of yet, unknown? [ANSWER]... Someone MAKES THEM UP! Then others join in with all their might thereby providing not only answers but the safety and security of numbers. A clear evolutionary advantage.\n \n The more one looks into this phenomena the more it appears that we \"evolved\" not only the tendancy.... but the need. And, when you add the growing mountain of evidence showing that particular religions have particular \"forms\" of mental illness or deviant behavior, the picture begins to clear. For example, anorexia nervosa is an American disease, almost exclusively to not only Western culture, but, girls who have grown up in a Catholic tradition. There are exceptions, of course, but hows that for a mind blower? There are dozens of mental illnesses that are specific to specific religions around the world.\n \n We know little of how the brain functions. Some people appear to function well with unanswered questions floating around in their head. Others CLEARLY do not! Condemning them for what appears to be folly to us is like is condemning them for being human. That's all they are emoticon_xangel \n \n [someone asked] Where can I read more on this..... I would suggest that you Google [Amazon books] and look at \"The Corruption of Reality\". It will lead you to a growing body of scientific literature.\n \n I would respectfully request that people refrain from the childlike tendancy to \"snitch\" to some administrative authority figure. Archie has every right to his beliefs, and his beliefs lead him to post as he posts. As the saying goes...... \"If you wrestle with a pig, two things are bound to happen. 1. You are gunna get dirty. 2. The pigs gunna love it.\n\n \n \n Good post :)",

   "I was presenting my thoughts to everybody. This is a forum where \"everybody\" gets to read our thoughts, so, I quite naturally assumed that it would be rude to use it as a one-to-one pipeline. I guess we all do that from time to time, but, I don't think that is what it was intended for. If you feel I am wrong, please feel free to correct me.\n \n We all have different \"ideas\" Johnhanks and I don't see how or why that should make us hostile to one another. As the old saying goes...\"Violence is always the last refuge of the incompetent.\"\n \n I admit that I find all the redundant RE-posting of what other people posted somewhat tedious. As if we all must read EVERYTHING over and over again to \"get it\". It takes up enormous space and, almost, implies that we either don't know what we posted or for some reason should enjoy reading it over and over and over. I think, if you/I can we should just endeavor to answer questions.... if we HAVE answers. If we don't, then we have the choice of falling silent or resorting to the old standby of calling people rude names and acting as if we are all in a \"huff\". \n \n It's amazing how much we ALL can learn if we agree to play by some rules of polite conduct.......no? Again, I apologize if I was unclear. I see a \"forum\" like unto addressing an audience on indeterminate size. When addressing any audience it is somewhat counterproductive to call each and every person in attendance by name each and every time one wishes to share an idea with everyone. In future, please assume that when I use the word [you], it will be in a general sense, unless I indicate otherwise. :xbanghead",
