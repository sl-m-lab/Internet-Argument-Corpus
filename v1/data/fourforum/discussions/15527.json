   "PeterV perhaps you could explain where the reasoning for your claims comes from. While the Founding Fathers couldn't have envisioned the existence of polymer-framed firearms, or polymers at all to begin with, they also couldn't foresee the existence of antibiotics, bottled water, toothpaste, inside plumbing, self contained pens, women's rights, a black man becoming president, or many other modern conveniences that the courts have ruled enjoy constitutional protection. However this gives no ground to the notion that only what the Founding Fathers could have foreseen is protected.\n \n This is beside the point however. Many firearms existed during the time of the Founding Fathers, whose designs have inspired the guns of the modern age. Long range rifles, heavy mounted weapon capable of firing more shots than any individual soldier, 75 caliber handguns, armor piercing weaponry, rapid shot personnel carried weapons, etc.\n \n However all of this is irrelevant to the point of this thread. The subject is how government enacted gun control laws have lead to the murder of innocent people, either foreign or indigenous who have been subjected to the regulations.\n \n If you wish to discuss matters relating to what modern items the Founding Fathers couldn't envision, and thus had no desire to protect them through the Constitution of the United States, then a thread designed for just such a debate is warranted in the appropriate section. This is not such a thread.",

Six teenagers have been arrested over his death and three remain in custody.\n \n On Tuesday night, a woman in her late 20s became London's latest stabbing victim, following the knife murder of a 34-year-old man on Monday.\n \n Both incidents took place in Southwark, south London.\n \n \"The dreadful murder of Ben Kinsella shows that the problem of knife crime is still with us,\" said Blair.\n \n \"I know the communities of London understand that this is something they and the police have to solve together and I promise that the Met is in this for the long haul and will do everything in its power to stop these murders continuing.\"\n \n On Tuesday, hundreds of people, many wearing T-shirts emblazoned with pictures of Kinsella and holding placards, took part in a protest led by the victim's family and friends through north London to the place where he was stabbed.\n \n \"Everybody is shocked by the level of violence we are seeing, particularly towards young people in London and we must all work as hard as we can together to reverse this dreadful trend,\" said Johnson.\n \n The Conservatives later released figures showing admissions to hospitals for people suffering stab wounds had risen every year since at least 2002/3.\n \n The figures, compiled by Hospital Episodes Statistics, found that the number had risen by 88 percent from 95 in 2002/3 to 179 in 2006/7, the most recent data available.\n \n Among 16 to 18-year-olds, there had been a 75 percent increase.\n \n \"These alarming figures betray just how vulnerable our youngsters are to violent and knife crime,\" said Tory Home Affairs spokesman Dominic Grieve.\n \n (Reporting by Tim Castle and Michael Holden; Editing by Steve Addison)'\n \n Alarming ain't it.Either way sheep to the slaughter.",
