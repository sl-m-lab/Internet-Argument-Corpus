Practice once a week and one game a week - and they are only a couple of weeks into the season. \n \n The tournament was in the AAU leagues. 3-4 games a weekend, multiple practices and months of playing. Our guys won their first game and made life hard for the other two teams they played. I am really proud of them. It was a good learning experience and I think they are going to come back into their regular league pretty tough.\n \n They should have won the second game, but my kid and one other kid got mad at each other, lost focus and threw the game off for the whole team. Coach pulled them off the floor and chewed them out - after that they kept up with the other team, but had lost too much ground at the beginning to catch up.\n \n I had a little chat with my kid about how when he is mad, or another player is mad and throwing down a bad attitude - the focus, for himself and his teamates, is on his crud - while the other team is focused on the game. He got it. This other kid does not. He gets mad all the time, insults his team when they make mistakes, gets mad at the refs when they make calls against him and earns us technical fouls. He also won't share the ball, which has lost us the ball more than once.
