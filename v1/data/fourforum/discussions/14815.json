   "There's a slight problem with Goddard's recommendations regarding future gun sales in the wake of the Virgina Tech massacre. The shooter, Cho, was able to pass four consecutive background checks when he went about arming himself. Two background checks carried out by the licensed dealer, and two carried out by the state police, because Virginia is one of those states that requires secondary background checks because they really don't trust you at all.\n \n Four consecutive background checks, over a several month period. If Cho could do this, which he did, then it wouldn't matter if background checks were made mandatory for private transfers, because he would've passed them anyway. In the end these proposals would've achieved absolutely no good even if they were implemented before the shootings took place.\n \n Even if Cho was shown as being prohibited from purchasing a firearm, and all secondary sales were recorded just like the initial sales are, he could have easily found someone with a clean record and strong dislike for society who could be his front man and acquire the weaponry for him instead. I believe that's what you call a straw purchase; somebody with a clean record going through the paperwork for somebody who can't do it.\n \n Of course another point arises from this discussion. Massacres aren't always carried out by people who have some sort of record that would signal them as being a danger to others. Massacres are just as easily carried out by people who have no recorded mental health issues and thus are off the radar. Even if all gun sales were recorded the same way, it wouldn't have done any good if Cho had a clean record to begin with and chose to carry out the massacre regardless.\n \n I've read over a lot of your posts on here, Galileo. You and others who all share the same message keep talking about making background checks at gun shows necessary, despite the fact that you consider straw buyers to be a serious risk because they can pass the background checks and essentially become unregulated dealers to sell to people who are prohibited.\n \n Why do you and others keep proposing mandatory background checks when you know said background checks can be so easily bypassed? You've offered no solution for this glaring gap in logic and I can't help but wonder why that is. You recognize what you consider to be two separate problems, and yet you don't have the apparent skills to try and draw a line between Point One and Point Two. You treat them like two entirely separate issues that can't overlap with each other.\n \n First there was your post about how hunters are poisoning the environment and endangering wildlife by using lead ammunition, and they're simply too stubborn and uncaring to look for unproven and highly expensive alternatives that environmental extremists declare to be non-toxic but offer no proof to support their claims.\n \n Second was you switching gears and changing from hunters to target shooters, claiming that they're poisoning the community through the sheer number of rounds they fire, while at the same point putting children at risk to toxic exposure through participating in their sport of choice.\n \n Third was your claiming of the position that the ATF needs more authority to compel dealers to submit sales records of long guns for inspection. I showed that the ATF and Attorney General already have this authority and can do just that, and you make a weak attempt to rebuff me and tell me that I'm wrong and that such authority doesn't exist.\n \n And now we have you adopting the position of Collin Goddard. You're putting forth the argument that ending the privacy aspect of private sales will help stop massacres from happening, despite the fact that in the past you've put forward arguments regarding straw purchasers who help criminals bypass the record keeping and shield them from detection.\n \n And now to get to the shortcomings of Collin Goddard's statement.\n \n \nHow about we improve the poor levels of records in our background check systems?\n\n \n Where's the money for this improvement going to come from? It's not going to be free after all. \n \n \nHow about we stop selling guns to people without those background checks at all?\n\n \n If you can propose a way to compel back alley dealers to adhere to federal regulations then I'd love to hear it. I want to see what you can suggest as an answer to the individuals that sell guns out of the trunk of their cars in ghetto neighborhoods.\n \n \nHow about we stop letting people who can't fly on planes legally buy guns?\n\n \n It's already been shown that people with absolutely no criminal connections are prohibited from flying on airplanes. Newborn babies are on the no fly list because their name was used by a known or suspected terrorist. Even former senator Ted Kennedy was on the no fly list for a time.\n \n At this current time there's no publicly available information regarding what makes on eligible for inclusion on the list, or a way to actually get off the list. It's punishment without trial, it violates your right to be be informed of what you did wrong, and your right to confront your accuser in a court of law. Perhaps Collin Goddard should stop advocating anti-constitutional standards.\n \n \nHow about we improve an under-funded law enforcement agency using dated technology to run our gun traces?\n\n \n Cho obliterated the serial number on at least one of his guns. How would a gun trace be possible in similar circumstances?\n \n \nHow about we try some of these measures first and see what happens to gun violence, not just on campuses, but around the country as a whole?\n\n \n We can't operate a nation of laws on the standard of \"how about\".\n \n \n\"If you have to pull out a gun to shoot someone who just burst into your classroom, you've already lost. Unless you know they're coming and you're concentrating on reacting and firing in a split second, you're at a disadvantage, and remember, you're in a classroom full of other students.\n\n \n The current standard of operation, no guns on school grounds for any reason, if what allowed 32 people to be senselessly murdered in the first place. Only Cho was armed, and he was armed illegally. He broke the laws and attacked the weakest and unprotected class of people he could; students. He specifically chose those he knew would never be able to fight him back.\n \n To the best of my knowledge there have been no school massacres in the state of Utah, where concealed carry on school grounds is perfectly legal? Coincidence? Or perhaps they're onto something over there.\n \n \nWe need to take a step back, and learn what allows these situations to come about - learn from previous school shootings in order to make it harder for a future gunman to be so lethal.\n\n \n Perhaps the fact that education centers are open and absolutely anybody can walk onto school grounds, enter the building and go about their mayhem. After all most public schools have no gates, no fences, no lockdown procedures for when school is in session, no nothing that would in any way prevent somebody from gaining unlawful access and committing atrocious acts against those who are unprotected.\n \n Perhaps if school grounds were more like prisons, with locking gates and electronic monitoring and guard towers and barbed wire fences and random pat downs and metal detectors, then maybe killings on school grounds would be less likely to happen. But who would ever send their children to such a facility of learning.\n \n Living in a free society requires accepting some measure of risk as unavoidable and inevitable, and learning to live with the possibility of death being a regular occurrence.\n \n \nLet me add, that if the state of Virginia permitted guns on campus, Cho, my classmate who killed 32 people, would have been carrying lawfully.\n\n \n 32 people were feloniously murdered regardless. Murder is illegal, bringing weapons onto campus is illegal, conspiracy to commit murder is illegal. Concealing a firearm without a permit is illegal. I'm not seeing how the possibility of legal concealment of a firearm would've made the situation any better.\n \n I'm also not seeing any indication that Cho would've chosen to obtain a concealed carry permit for the sole purpose of going about his merry way murdering those 32 students that day. That's akin to claiming that someone wouldn't rob a bank and drive a getaway car unless they first had a driver's license.\n \n \n\"I can't accept the 'There's nothing we can do so I want a gun to protect myself' mentality\n\n \n Collin Goddard's inability to cope with the facts of that day are no reason for him to try and force his faulty logic on others.\n \n \nShould the first thing we do is to allow the 'good' students to bring guns to class to shoot it out with the 'bad'? No.\"\n\n \n The current status quo, which basically amounts to hogtying those that would be victims, doesn't seem to be an acceptable, standard. As it is we're practically gift wrapping our children and begging crazed individuals to please come and murder them because they're ripe for the picking.\n \n The age for enlistment in the army is 18. College students go as low as 18 all the way up to adulthood depending on the circumstances. Are we going to try and claim that even in these circumstances, where the students might be military veterans and properly trained adults, letting them be armed for their own defense while at a facility of learning is still an unacceptable notion of practice?",

   "Oh boy, where to start with this mish mash of incoherent ramblings. Sometimes I wonder if Brady is simply doing this for the sake of trolling purposes.\n \n \nAs the early American political scholar Benjamin Oliver wrote in 1832, the \"cowardly and disgraceful\" act of carrying concealed weapons transformed what might have been a barroom brawl into a deadly encounter.[332]\n\n \n It's very funny really. I tried to look up this scholar by the name of Benjamin Oliver, but outside of the dissent in Heller he receives very little mention or notice. He appears to be an obscure figure of extremely limited importance, little recognition, and an opinion that isn't shared by more mainstream thinkers.\n \n It's almost like the dissenters of Heller went out of their way to find someone -anyone- of a historical status that might possibly share their views and give them some measure of credit. However despite their best efforts they seem to have come up short.\n \n \nThe Second Amendment, which Oliver held relevant only to the militia system, offered nothing \"to prevent congress or the legislatures of the different states from enacting laws to prevent citizens from always going armed.\"[333] Most state legislators agreed with Oliver's interpretation.\n\n \n Well when one considers historical context, for a long while the US Constitution didn't apply to the various state governments. That was one of the main reasons for the 14th Amendment being passed after the Civil War; to bind the states of the union so that they must abide by the Constitution evenly. However this isn't the same as saying that Benjamin Oliver is correct. Far from it actually.\n \n \nAs early as 1801, the Tennessee legislature made it illegal for anyone to \"publicly ride or go armed to the terror of the people, or privately carry any dirk, large knife, pistol, or any other dangerous weapon, to the fear or terror of any person.\"[334]\n\n \n What exactly does \"to the fear or terror of any person\" translate to in reasonable terms? How is it applied? Were there exceptions to those that were recognized members of the Tennessee state militia who were on their way to regular practice and drilling sessions?\n \n If you can show us that this law existed then perhaps you could also show us the full text of the law. Simply saying that it existed isn't enough to prove anything, we need to see it so we know exactly what it says. There are always exceptions listed in laws like these.\n \n \nLouisiana's 1813 act outlawing the carrying of concealed [Page 101] firearms allowed police officers to stop and search anyone suspected of carrying a concealed weapon.[335]\n\n \n A concealed weapon, but were there any prohibitions on the open carry of weapons? Were men and women forbidden by law from walking away openly carrying their rifles, shotguns or pistols in a clear and present manner in full view of anyone looking?\n \n \nSeveral state constitutions forbade noncitizens from possessing firearms.[336]\n\n \n Noncitizens of the specific state in question, or noncitizens of the country? And how exactly would one prove their citizenry status?\n \n \nThis fear of concealed weapons accelerated in the 1830s as pistols became smaller. In 1832 Illinois instituted a $ 100 fine for anyone caught carrying \"upon him any pistol, gun, knife, bludgeon, or other offensive weapon.\"[337] Ohio's fine was $ 200.[338] In 1837, Georgia's legislature forbade shopkeepers from selling or even stocking pistols and concealable bladed weapons.[339]\n\n \n Was it a fear of people in general carrying concealable weapons? Or was it a fear of freed blacks being able to stand on equal ground with white people that drove this course of action? Keep in mind that there are examples of gun control laws that specifically said people of african american status weren't allowed to be armed. It was laws such as these that necessitated the passage of the 14th Amendment.\n \n \nThe Georgia Supreme Court later declared this statute unconstitutional in that it prohibited the carrying of weapons, but constitutional in its prescription of how they were carried.\n\n \n That really doesn't say much for your position Brady. You've admitted that the Supreme Court of Georgia found that a law outlawing the sale and transport of handguns was unconstitutional in nature. That's basically shooting yourself in the foot. That sets historical precedent to show that the carrying of weapons was seen as vital and important in daily life.\n \n \nRepeatedly, individuals directly involved in the ratification of the Second Amendment voted unhesitatingly to limit the rights of gun ownership. Chicago-Kent Law Review\n\n \n You know something very interesting Brady? The link takes us to an article by Michael A Bellesiles. It's well known that Bellesiles has been made subject to much controversy and scrutiny for his work on this topic. Not only was his Bancroft Prize rescinded, he also lost his Emory professorship as a result.\n \n Here's an interesting article detailing the matter further than I could in my own words:\n \n The Bancroft and Bellesiles\n \n Below is an official announcement released Friday, December 13, 2002, by the Columbia University Board of Trustees.\n \n Columbia University's Trustees have voted to rescind the Bancroft Prize awarded last year to Michael Bellesiles for his book Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture. The Trustees made the decision. Based on a review of an investigation of charges of scholarly misconduct against Professor Bellesiles by Emory University and other assessments by professional historians. They concluded that he had violated basic norms of scholarship and the high standards expected of Bancroft Prize winners. The Trustees voted to rescind the Prize during their regularly scheduled meeting on December 7, 2002 and have notified Professor Bellesiles of their decision.\n \n The Bancroft Prize, which was first offered in 1948, is to be awarded for works in American history of \"distinguished merit and distinction.\" The selection criteria for the Prize specify that it \"should honor only books of enduring worth and impeccable scholarship that make a major contribution to our understanding of the American past.\" Professor Bellesiles' book seemed to fulfill these criteria at the time of selection. However, it has since been the subject of substantial debate within the community of American historians that included charges that Professor Bellesiles had committed scholarly misconduct in the use of some of his primary source materials.\n \n In response to these charges, Emory University, where Professor Bellesiles holds an appointment, established a panel of three distinguished scholars from other universities to conduct a review. On October 25, 2002, following this review, the panel issued a report. In it, the panel members found \"evidence of falsification\" with respect to one of the questions they were asked to consider; spoke of \"serious failures of and carelessness in the gathering and presentation of archival records and the use of quantitative analysis\" on two others; and questioned \"his veracity\" with respect to a fourth. They also concluded that he had \"contravened\" the norms of historical scholarship both \"as expressed in the Committee charge and in the American Historical Association's definition of scholarly 'integrity.'\"\n \n Columbia's Trustees considered the report of the Emory investigating committee and Professor Bellesiles' response to it. They also considered assessments by professional historians of the subject matter of that report.\n \n After considering all of these materials, the Trustees concurred with the three distinguished scholars who reviewed the case for Emory University that Professor Bellesiles had violated basic norms of acceptable scholarly conduct. They consequently concluded that his book had not and does not meet the standards they had established for the Bancroft Prize.\n \n In making their decision, the Trustees emphasized that the judgment to rescind the Bancroft Prize was based solely on the evaluation of the questionable scholarship of the work and had nothing to do with the book's content or the author's point of view.\n \n That really doesn't sound like Michael A Bellesiles is a reliable source to be citing when attempting to back up your own mistaken position.\n \n \nLike Breyer said they didnt really mean the right that seriously.\n\n \n I must disagree with both you and Justice Breyer. The Founding Fathers were very knowledgeable about what they were doing. I see no reason why they would include something in the Bill of Rights if they didn't mean for it to be taken seriously. Where's the historical context for this? Would you seriously put something into the founding document of a new nation if you didn't intend for it to be taken as seriously as possible?\n \n What amounts to an April Fool's Day joke has no place in what is considered the most important document in the history of a nation. That would be like the Catholic Church telling all its members that the practice of abstaining from meat on Friday was nothing more than a joke and they never thought it would be taken so far.\n \n The Founding Fathers obviously intended for our right to a speedy and public trial by jury to be taken seriously, thus putting it in the Sixth Amendment.\n \n \nAnd its not like gun rights are the only important thing. Public safety is important too.\n\n \n The definition of \"public safety\" is highly dependent on who you ask and what time frame the question is asked. It's a relative term and a temporary standard that can change wildly from one location to another, from one time to another, from one person to another. As I explained this in a previous post, a temporary standard shouldn't be allowed to influence the meaning of a constitutional right and completely bypass it.\n \n Currently we're told that terrorism is a threat to our public safety. But out current issue with terrorism is temporary at best. The Fourth Amendment does a lot to prohibit the government from having a blank check on invading the rights and privacy of the American people in the name of finding \"terrorism\" wherever it might be. This current and temporary issue shouldn't be grounds for completely eviscerating the protections offered when it comes to a person's privacy and security in their documents and possessions.",

Keep sitting on your back pockets in Oztralia and play with a crocodile that washed up. The U.S. armed forces saved your rump in WWII as much as you hate to admit it.\n \n \"Republicans\"? We are all Republicans in the sense this is a REPUBLIC governed by the Contitution. Each State is required and guaranteed to have a Republican form of government. Most congressmen heard it read aloud yesterday in Congress for the first time ever. Hello true Law. That means you have to follow the law, the Constitution which you intensely dislike.\n \n A standing army is within congress power and appropriations for 2 year periods which has escalated under DEMOCRATS.\n \n Exactly where on the board have you proven militia laws involved registration? You don't even know who the militia is despite repeated postings of U.S.C. 10, section 311.",

   "A diversionary tactic... I was responding to Doc Jones' post about licensing and registration, but you throw a red herring at me about the DC gun ban. Noted.\n\n \n A diversionary tactic? A red herring? Really? I don't see how my mentioning of Washington DC's gun laws could be considered as either since it was you who originally introduced the topic and made it citeable for later reference. And I felt it relevant when you talked about \"moderate restrictions of personal gun ownership\" and how you thought the Founding Fathers wouldn't care about the laws currently in place.\n \n I'm not a history professor like Michael A Bellesiles that you cited at an earlier point. Historical law isn't my strong point. But I do know that the Founding Fathers rebelled against a corrupt and tyrannical king who made a mockery of the rule of law for his own sick amusement. Our Founding Fathers rebelled against governmental corruption and abuse of human rights that were carried out with no regard. And I find it objectionable that you would suggest, with these experiences ingrained in their memories, they could be perfectly alright with the notion that the people must first beg for permission from the government before they be allowed to exercise rights they felt were so important they chose to recognize them in the founding document of the nation.\n \n \nWhy bother? \"It's hard to take your argument seriously when you demand far more rigid standards of proof than you apply to yourself.\" Yawn....\n\n \n I have cited examples of previous statements and positions you've made when replying to you and whatever your latest argument is. I don't see why it's so unacceptable that you be asked to cite whatever source holds evidence that militia weapons were registered and made traceable during the 17-1800s in the United States.\n \n You asked the question about whether or not it had been shown and/or proven. If you were going to introduce that off tangent line of discussion then you should've been prepared for the possibility of being called out and asked to show evidence to support your claim.\n \n The forum really isn't that hard to search and locate something of relevance, especially if one is keeping tabs for later use and noting the location of something that's said. It's relatively easy to find something that's been presented in the past, and bring it forward for future discussion if necessary.",
