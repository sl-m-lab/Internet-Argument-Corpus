   "Assumptions:\n God has one or more of these qualities\n A1 - God exists and is beyond understanding\n A2 - God exists and is beyond the natural universe\n A3 - God exists and cannot be observed\n \n If your notion of god does not have any of these qualities, I submit that god is not the definition of the christian god in question (or any such god that is said to have one or more of these qualities), and you'll need to supply your own definition of god so we know what you're talking about. If your idea of god is observable, able to be understood, or within the natural universe, we can test and prove it's existence. Then we wouldn't be having a debate, there wouldn't be a religion forum (it would be in philosophy, or science, or math, or other such useful forums)\n \n Do not use fallacy and make the claim that only \"part\" of god is knowable, and other parts are unknowable. Or that \"part\" of god is beyond the natural universe, and part within, etc. These all reduce to the same logical contradiction.\n \n Any or all of these suffice for the root issue of claims with regards to god(s), to make distinctions is unecessary, but communication is imperfect so alternate avenues may save time.\n \n My claims:\n \n B1: Making a claim that God exists, but is \"beyond knowledge\" is a logical contradiction.\n B2: Making a claim that God exists, but cannot be observed (in principle), is a logical contradiction.\n B3: Making a claim that God exists, outside of nature, is a logical contradiction.\n \n \n Why?\n \n C1: If you claim to have knowledge of something that is \"beyond\" knowledge, it's a contradiction in plain english. I have knowledge of something that cannot be known. I have knowledge of something unknowable. Obviously a logical contradiction.\n \n C2: If you claim to know of the existence of some thing, but then claim that some thing cannot be observed (in principle), then it's another contradiction. I claim to have knowledge of something that I cannot by definition have knowledge of. Another unknowable, another contradiction.\n \n C3: If you claim something is beyond the natural universe, the conclusion is that it cannot be observed, since we can only observe, by definition, things within the natural universe. Once again, you claim to have knowledge that something exists, that cannot be observed by definition, another contradiction.\n \n \n D1: Atheism - no belief that \"god\" exists\n Correct. The concept of god is a logical contradiction and logical contradictions cannot, by definition, exist.\n \n D2: Agnostic - no belief in god exists based on insufficient evidence of such gods\n ** incorrect because you cannot logically have evidence that a contradiction exists. You CAN know if a god exists, if a god can be known. A god cannot be known given the above illogical qualities, therefore you cannot claim it's an undefined question. It's logically false. To deny it's logically false, is an error, or ignorance. It's like saying you have 0 evidence out of 0 possible evidence, it's irrational, it's not 0, it's not unknown, it's nonsensical.\n \n D3: Theist (religious) - belief that god exists\n **incorrect because it professes belief that a logical contradiction exists..i.e. denies logic. (I'd add in a few dozen other colorful adjectives, but I suspect that too would be irrelevant, although correct and fun).\n \n \n \n If you agree with any one of the numbered threads (A1-4, B1-4, or C1-4), then I'm correct, and I'll throw the others out for the sake of efficiency.\n \n If you disagree with one or more, please use the appropriate letter/number to indicate which areas you have issue with.\n \n It would be most helpful if you use the root issue..i.e. if B2 logically follows from A2, and you disagree with B2 only because you disagree with A2, then list A2 and not B2, so we can save time and not cloud the issue.\n \n -Mach",

So of course it's illogical that god exists, but you can't prove a negative.\n\n \n \n That's why this is a tricky question, but it still works. Your points are good, I think they would be the more reasonable objections, but we can worth through them too, we HAVE to, I'm either right, or wrong.\n \n I see two points that I think you want addressed:\n \n 1. We can never disprove things that are conceptually illogical.\n 2. Existence can be defined differently by different people.\n \n \n - 1. This is true. This is also my point. For you to say there \"could\" be evidence of an entitiy that can, by definition, have no evidence, would be contradictory. It's not that you can't claim to have evidence, it's that there can be, by definition NO EVIDENCE. Theists have to deny logic and reality to carve out a space for a god in our thinking. The first thing they do of course is attack the foundation....logic/reason. By claiming some things are \"beyond reason\" or \"beyond logic\", they proceed to build on this foundation that FAITH provides knowledge of what's beyond these.\n \n Of course, we know that to begin with, these are logical contradictions, which is NOT suprising. Theists must either be logically correct, or incorrect, or be saying \"nothing\".\n \n Again, it's like saying you're concerned that you have 0 evidence divided by 0 possible evidence. It's not rational.\n \n 2. Existence having different definitions is simply clouding the issue, a diversionary fallacy. We pin them to each definition, and address each in turn. The end result of any definition debate always reduces to:\n \n 1. Logically the two words have identical implications and it's a moot difference, they can be used interchangeably for the debate.\n 2. Logically the two words have opposite implications and one or the other is correct (which is the case here).\n 3. Logically one or more of the words have irrelevant implications (logically irrelevant to the claim at hand).\n \n \n You ask me: prove a unie exists\n I respond: OK, show me a unie and I'll prove it exists:\n Z: No, that's the point, I want you to prove one exists.\n M: You're then asking me to prove, through rational demonstration, that a unie exists, but you're admitting there is no rational demonstration possible.\n Z: No, it might be rationally demonstratable, but how can you know someone else is not looking at a unie right now?\n M: I can't, but I can be sure that it's logically impossible to prove or disprove a concept as existing, if we cannot rationally demonstrate it. \n Z: Then you cannot be sure a unie does not exist!\n M: No, rationally, discussing a unie is like saying:\n Prove a j340gj02jg2g2 exists. It has no meaning, it ignores the foundations of reason that we USE for such proofs. You must have evidence of existence before you ask for proof of existence.\n \n This of course makes complete sense, when you think about how we do this in reality, every day. Your friend walks up and says \"Here's $100\". He hands you nothing. You claim the $100 doesn't exist. He claims it does. Is he rational or irrational or insane? Irrational or insane is the correct answer.\n \n A theist walks up to you and says God exists, he's all around us, see? You say, why no, I don't see, or feel/taste/touch/smell this god entity either. But he's right here, you are just a non-believer! Yes, that's correct, you're either irrational or insane, I don't believe things exist, when there is not, and can be no, evidence that they exist. The dictionary also has a word for that...guess what it is. NON-EXISTENCE.\n \n -Mach",

That's why, for example, births, deaths, marriages, etc., are marked by religious ceremonies.\n \n In a world of educated people governed by reason and logic, we can surmise that religion would become a moribund curiosity.

   "I think your logical analysis of the problem examined in this thread is clinical and thorough. A few people will gnaw at the edges of your thesis but do no serious damage to its substance.\n \n Unfortunately (as you seem to hint at in this response), religious people do not base their beliefs on logical principles. They arrive at certain conclusions, if they deliberate at all, by \"intuitions\" and by inculcation at an impressionable age, etc. Consequently, no rational argument however comprehensive and elegant is likely to shake the emotional investment that their religious faith demands and to which they have assented. Belief in God is a kind of default setting in the psychology of many, many individuals - and allows them to return to a \"certainty\" at significant moments in their lives. That's why, for example, births, deaths, marriages, etc., are marked by religious ceremonies.\n \n In a world of educated people governed by reason and logic, we can surmise that religion would become a moribund curiosity. But we live in no such world, and perhaps David Hume was right in saying that among the unreflecting and ignorant masses, religion serves a useful purpose.\n\n \n Yes, and as you also hint, this is not an original work by any stretch, most philosphers comment on \"gods\", and certainly many books and web pages and discussions contribute to this way of discussing the issue.\n \n Interestingly enough, rational individuals will generally, if take to logical conclusions, will always agree, and conclusions will always be the same, so we can't really get \"Creative\" with knowledge, only in our SEARCH for the knowledge. Once we have the knowledge, the most creative we can get is to use some creative analogy :) :)\n \n Lastly, those are my goals I suppose:\n \n #1 To make it clear that to have faith in a god, is illogical, and irrational.\n #2 To make sure all defenders of reason understand this investigation (which when I read in many forms, was pleased to see it thought through) of \"gods and the supernatural\" and can better justify why they don't believe in them.\n \n I'm still sad that no one told me sooner, what I already knew in vague form, so I am here trying to correct what I felt was an injustice.\n \n -Mach",

Are you assuming that nature is the only thing in existance? If you go by the reason you stated as C3, you're contradicting evolution or any theory of creation and development of mankind in way.

I am just defining this as irrational.\n \n \nGiven that our knowledge of the universe (that we know exists?) is next to nothing relative to what (we think?) it contains then it's probable (not just possible?) that there is something outside what we know (or can know).\n\n Maybe, but you and I don't make claims about it as true. If we did, we'd be in irrational/illogical territory.\n \n \nThere is no evidence that life DOES exist on other planets.\n There is evidence that the supernatural COULD exist. \n It lies in the fact that we don't know diddly squat.\n\n \n No, fundamental difference. You are referring to something extra-ordinary, or seemingly supernatural, or seemingly magical, etc. Supernatural is OUTSIDE the natural, by definition, something not only can we not comment on in terms of true or false, but cannot, by definition, exist. It cannot exist, and not-exist.\n \n \n \nYes, now I get it. \n The way you defined god limits the outcome.\n It is a premise that may just be a strawman, \n but it's flawed because we don't know if \"god\" is unknowable or not,\n because we don't know if it even exists.\n\n \n Because we don't know if what is unknowable or not? Don't use the word god unless you define it. If you tell me you think god is knowable, and your definition of god is a knowable entity that exists, we can discuss this. If you tell me we don't know if god exists, and god is not knowable, then you are being irrational. You choose, not me, it's not a strawman, I clearly indicate what I'm talking about.\n \n \n\n We're really treading into the expertise of our glorious Secretary of Defense here. ;)\n\n Heheheh. :)\n \n \nAgain, we don't know if anything that we don't know is knowable or not.\n That's why we don't know.\n If we knew if it was knowable or not, \n we'd have a better idea if it exists or not.\n\n \n That's just it. Two words:\n unknown (not known)\n unknowable (not knowable)\n \n If you claim knowledge of something that CAN be known, then you must rationally demonstrate it (and would have to in order to have knowledge of it).\n If you claim knowledge of something that in principle cannot be known (by the very definition you start with), then you're in illogical-land again.\n \n \nAll theories have their limits as does our understanding.\n I just think it is a limitation of current theory and our own understanding of the universe.\n Dark matter is highly dubious, but some people must keep looking for it.\n Other people that doubt it more are looking into what may be wrong\n with current theories.\n\n \n Doubt, unknowns, theories...all OK.\n Discussing contradictions as existing...illogical!\n \n \n \nWe do not have this luxury of sufficient data when it comes to \"god.\"\n\n \n Gotcha again. You're making claims as true, that we do not have sufficent data [to prove or disprove the existence] of \"god\".\n \n Your claim is either logical (in that god can have data to prove or disprove him), or not (god by definition is not observable, knowable, or beyond our universe, etc.).\n \n Evidence is not a luxury, it's implied when we discuss having knowledge of the existence of something!\n \n -Mach",

If your idea of god is observable, able to be understood, or within the natural universe, we can test and prove it's existence. Then we wouldn't be having a debate, there wouldn't be a religion forum (it would be in philosophy, or science, or math, or other such useful forums)\n \n Do not use fallacy and make the claim that only \"part\" of god is knowable, and other parts are unknowable. Or that \"part\" of god is beyond the natural universe, and part within, etc. These all reduce to the same logical contradiction.\n \n Any or all of these suffice for the root issue of claims with regards to god(s), to make distinctions is unecessary, but communication is imperfect so alternate avenues may save time.\n \n My claims:\n \n B1: Making a claim that God exists, but is \"beyond knowledge\" is a logical contradiction.\n B2: Making a claim that God exists, but cannot be observed (in principle), is a logical contradiction.\n B3: Making a claim that God exists, outside of nature, is a logical contradiction.\n \n \n Why?\n \n C1: If you claim to have knowledge of something that is \"beyond\" knowledge, it's a contradiction in plain english. I have knowledge of something that cannot be known. I have knowledge of something unknowable. Obviously a logical contradiction.\n \n C2: If you claim to know of the existence of some thing, but then claim that some thing cannot be observed (in principle), then it's another contradiction. I claim to have knowledge of something that I cannot by definition have knowledge of. Another unknowable, another contradiction.\n \n C3: If you claim something is beyond the natural universe, the conclusion is that it cannot be observed, since we can only observe, by definition, things within the natural universe. Once again, you claim to have knowledge that something exists, that cannot be observed by definition, another contradiction.\n \n \n D1: Atheism - no belief that \"god\" exists\n Correct. The concept of god is a logical contradiction and logical contradictions cannot, by definition, exist.\n \n D2: Agnostic - no belief in god exists based on insufficient evidence of such gods\n ** incorrect because you cannot logically have evidence that a contradiction exists. You CAN know if a god exists, if a god can be known. A god cannot be known given the above illogical qualities, therefore you cannot claim it's an undefined question. It's logically false. To deny it's logically false, is an error, or ignorance. It's like saying you have 0 evidence out of 0 possible evidence, it's irrational, it's not 0, it's not unknown, it's nonsensical.\n \n D3: Theist (religious) - belief that god exists\n **incorrect because it professes belief that a logical contradiction exists..i.e. denies logic.

The most you can say is that it is not known. You note that you use the word \"assumed\". That is not a logical conclusion but rather an \"assumption\". If you start with the assumption that god does not exist then you logically reach the conclusion that god does not exist (reflexive property).

   "This is actually a complete misunderstanding of what theists would mean\n of God as \"unknowable\", on your part.\n \n They do not mean that you cannot know anything of God, and that you\n cannot know that He exists; I would like you to show me one theist\n would adhere to that. What theists mean by \"unknowable\", is that we\n cannot fully know God -- we cannot know everything about Him. Indeed,\n that is a logical impossibility; to know all about an omniscient entity\n would be to be omniscient.\n\n \n I see your achilles heel is religion, you throw logic out the door when\n you debate it.\n \n First, note, that I mentioned this in the very first post, right up at the top. Indeed I was aware that some might \"try\" to claim that being only partially unknowable, is logically just like being knowable! (how insane).\n \n Let me show you what I read when I read your response:\n -< dreamweaver\n What theists mean by \"unknowable\", is that we cannot fully know God --\n we cannot know everything about Him\n \n Logically, you claim a number of things:\n 1. Presupposed existence of god (which we'll let slide to show the rest)\n 2. That you know, as a theist, that SOME parts of god are knowable, and\n some are NOT knowable...i.e. unknowable.\n \n You are, in black and white, claiming exactly what you seem to be trying\n to reject that theists claim. Once again: You claim you know an existing entity (assumed for now), that posses certainly qualities that are unknowable.\n Logically, you claim to have knowledge of the unknowable...again. \n Which is fitting, since that's what's wrong with the defense in the\n first place.\n \n Yet you don't do it once, or twice, you cannot, you must use a\n contradiction else you'd be agreeing with me, so we see another example in the same rebuttal::\n \nto know all about an omniscient entity would be to be omniscient.\n\n \n You claim this existing entity (which we let slide for now), is omniscient! You just used this as a premise.\n How did you arrive at this knowledge?! (you cannot logically)\n \n A claim about existing entities that are omniscient, is EXACTLY the same\n argument you are attempting to claim you (and theists in general) don't\n make. I know the subject has been drilled into your head as correct, but under casual examination, it simply is not logical.\n \n To know if some entitiy is omniscient, you must be omniscient, and\n omniscience is an unknowable concept, as you know, and I hope you\n aren't claiming you are omniscient.\n \n So you are using the point I'm showing is illogical, as the rebuttal. I'm afraid I can't do anything more than point you right back to the first post, and ask which specific, clear, claims or conclusions I draw, have the logical flaw. It's OK if you don't, I don't care who's right or wrong, I just want the correct information.\n \n \nTheists make certain claims about God, so it's really quite frivolous to\n presuppose that by any use of \"unknowable\" that they'd mean you cannot\n know anything of God.\n\n \n Same as above, you claim PART of god is unknowable, same logic applies,\n still illogical, a logical \"AND\" does not save you.\n \n I already discussed this in the original post, for you to claim part of\n god is unknowable has two problems.\n #1 you claim knowledge of the unknowable (that certain qualities of god\n are unknowable...this is a contradiction again)\n #2 that somehow part knowable, and part unknowable make the entitiy you\n claim has both qualities, logically possible, which is the exact same\n logical contradiction we're discucssing, a logical AND (has both\n knowable AND unknowable qualities) does not change the logical outcome\n anyway, so why bother trying that route.\n \n It matters not if you claim you can know SOME of god is knowable, and SOME is not. You see, I don't have yet, a logical claim about anyone's claims about a \"knowable\" god, we could quickly analyze such claims with science and determine if it's true, or false, and if so, to what degree. Yet we CANNOT do this, since you, or theists, or whoever, suggests that SOME of god is UNKNOWABLE.\n \n \nBelieve it or not, studying some theology might help; in which case,\n you'd know what you were arguing against.\n\n \n It seems to me that I know more than you do on the topic at hand, and of\n course, neither your point, nor this one, are relevant, you have yet to\n refute anything. If you had, it would be a clear, and concise,\n refutation of the logic or some other fallacy of mine, and as we see,\n there are no significant flaws.\n \n \nAlso, please stop using \"observing\" and \"knowing\" as inherently\n synonymous and interchangeable. They certainly are not.\n\n I will try, since they aren't crucial to the point yet. I think\n knowing something as \"existing\" requires observation, so in that\n respect they imply the same thing, but we digress from the real topic..i.e. how I'm correct or incorrect.\n \n \n\n Probably the wildest few sentences I've ever seen on this forum.\n \n Square -- a shape with four corners\n Circle -- a shape with no corners; where the curve is equidistant around\n a centre.\n \n \"Square Circle\" -- Contradiction. Logical impossibility; cannot exist\n ever. QED.\n And no, the concept doesn't exist, because it's metaphysically\n impossible as well. The most you could say is that it's an epistemic\n possibility, but that's not saying much at all.\n\n \n You missed the point, and failed in your analysis.\n Proof of existence requires rational demonstration, you cannot rationally demontrate a concept, or a contradiction (conceptual or not), so you CANNOT DISCUSS having or not having evidence for existence with regards to it. It's NONSENSICAL. You did NOT prove it's non-existence, you proved the statement was illogical, and we can proceed to then gather or reject evidence. We're not talking about 1+1, we're talking about claims of existence, which by definition, must have evidence, else, you're blowing hot air.\n \n It reduces to this:\n Prove, using evidence, that this entity (Square circle) exists, when by\n definition the entity in principle can have no evidence to support it's\n existence.\n \n You're telling me you proved this false.\n I'm telling you it's illogical to beging with, let's not build on illogical premises. You cannot get to the claim of \"is there evidence or is there no evidence\" with such a statement. There CAN BE NO EVIDENCE, by definition, since it's a contradiction.\n \n Can there be evidence of an unknowable (in part or whole!!!!) god?\n It's a contradiction, we can't discussing evidence for or against, with regards to a contradiction.\n ----------------------------------------\n \n I have no choice but to label your refutations illogical, otherwise, I'd have to call them logical, and they have not yet proven to be anything other than:\n \n 1. repeating the knowledge of the, as claimed, unknowable (part or whole, logically the same conclusion)\n 2. Arguing that one can have evidence (definitions of square and circle) out of a total possible evidence of 0, and claim you have proof of an illogical claim.\n \n The implication being, as theists like it to be, that we simply don't have enough information to know god fully, you see, we're just not divine, you know...we're not enlightened yet...but oh we WILL be once we die!\n \n No, it's not that we don't have enough evidence, or the right evidence...it's because the entire fabric of most mythological dogmatic stories about divinity are completely illogical and nonsensical.\n \n Notice in the above theistic implication that I mention the premise is:\n \n - God exists\n - but we don't have enough information to know god fully\n \n The premise of existence is the problem, you do not get to proceed to step2, information on existence, when by definition this god concept is non-existence.

   "As to A1-3. You state that claiming only \"part of God\" is knowable is a fallacy. Please Identify the fallacy. \n \n I submit that God is a person. God is knowable in the same sense that any human being is knowable. He may not be visually observed by me, but has been in the past. He also relates to me. The idea of no god is actually illogical. If there is no god then the universe (which is orderly) reduces to something that is completely disordered and chaotic. This contradicts basic observation and therefore would not be correct.\n \n The only truly logical conclusion is that God does exist. Nothing else makes sense.\n\n \n I'll show you. Keep in mind, it's fallacy because you're using it as refutation of my claim.\n \n Then I'l re-state your claims to analyze (Maybe later though, there seem to be a lot all at once!)\n =====\n \n me: God is unknowable\n me: to claim knowledge of god as \"existing\" is a logical contradiction.\n =======\n That's wrong because:\n \n you: God is part knowable\n you: God is part unknowable\n \n Me: We can test something you claim as knowable - < let's go test it (we do some research, call some people, think a lot, write stuff down, look at video footage, etc., etc.)\n \n Me: On your second claim, you claim knowledge of the unknowable, this is a logical contradiction, we're back to my first claim anyway, we just went the long way.\n ========\n \n So, logically, on the whole, if god is part logical, and part illogical, god is illogical. Then we're back to my claim. But we dont' even have to combine them, we can just table your first claim (Part of god is knowable), then attack the second claim (part of god is not-knowable) with exactly the same logic.\n \n So you're either rejecting that god is entirely knowable.\n OR\n You are claiming god is in one or more ways, unknowable\n \n All roads lead to the same place. It's like saying I have a hammer.\n The hammer handle is made of wood, here, feel it, see it..it's real.\n BUT\n The head of the hammer is cannot be observed in any way, at any time.\n \n Does this \"hammer\" exist?\n \n No, if the hammer is both the handle, and the unobservable head, then logically the hammer, does not exist. Saying part, but not all, does not save the argument, it's not partially illogical, it's illogical.\n \n AS to your other claims:\n Let's list them.\n cumulaitve god claims:\n \n 1. God is a person\n <2. God exists\n <3. God is \"knowable\" in that you \"know\" god exists, and is a person\n <4. You have sufficient, rational demonstratable evidence that god is a human being (or was?)\n 2. God is knowable (restated, OK)\n 3. God is not now visibly observable (is dead I assume you mean)\n 4. This dead human relates to you now\n 5. You throw in the teleological argument (bougs) for grins. I'll show you why mainstream philosphy, science, and logical folk, reject this argument in another post.\n 6. Worse, you claim that human observation is infallible, in that you claim to seemingly contradict observation is a logical contradiction (do I need to disprove this one? You're in the mental health field...even the most healthy and honest people are entirely fallible in all sensory and intellectual capacities. If we could use human observation to overturn logic, things would be chaotic, as you suggest. \n \n The scary thing is that faith, results in chaotic nonsense, while logic and reason promote order...exactly the opposite of what you claim.\n \n That's a lot of stuff all at once, I'll have to drum up more time this weekend.\n \n -Mach",

   "No, I defined the concept as such. We can let religious people define god all day long. He's either defined as unknowable (in many colorful ways), or not. If unknowable, this applies. If not, then we're not really talking about a god are we?\n\n Why does a definition of \"god\" require it to be unknowable?\n Do you know what happens to a person's consciousness after they die?\n Probably not.\n Does this mean that no one ever knows?\n Probably the people that die know.\n Maybe they don't.\n \n For all we know, god (or whatever we haven't discovered) may very well be knowable, and for all we know understandable. Since we actually have no clue as to what \"god\" actual is, if anything, then who can really proclaim that god is unknowable or beyond comprehension?\n \n \n \n \nthe concept of other life..i.e. other organized matter/energy that functions as we defined life functions, is entirely logically possible. \n \n \nThen why isn't the supernatural?\n\n \nBecause the concept is logically possible.\n\n\n Not sure if you meant that the existence of something outside the known universe is logically possible, but if you did, then I agree. There is nothing to suggest that existence outside the known universe is impossible.\n \n \n \nIt falls back to the argument about whether something is unknowable or not.\n If we assume that the supernatural is unknowable then we've drawn the conclusion based on zero evidence.\n \n \nNo, your argument falls into the same trap. YOu argue, oddly, that you CAN have evidence for an illogical concept. You cannot even dicsuss evidence for or against, when they concept itself is illogical, this is the entire point.\n\n\n ???\n You're losing me here.\n You say that the supernatural is unknowable.\n You have zero evidence to back this up.\n You don't know that the supernatural is unknowable.\n You simply CLAIM that the existence of the supernatural is just plain illogical,\n but maybe you should explain exactly why you think it's illogical.\n \n \n\n Prove a square circle does not exist!\n\n Thankfully, you've asked my to prove something that can be proven.\n because it's based on definitions. You can only truly prove something in math or maybe in semantics (here we have a little of both).\n \n Square: a closed shape with 4 equal-length, straight sides and four 90 degree angles among them\n Circle: a closed shape with a continous line in which all points are equidistant to a single point at the center.\n \n Square (does not equal) Circle\n \n You cannot have a shape that meets both these definitions (in flat Euclidean space).\n \n Therefore you cannot have a circle that is also a square, by the definitions that we have given these words.\n \n I don't know what the point of that was, but...\n \n \nYou cannot, because it's both a concept and not based on something that exists, worse still, it's illogical. You can't by definition have evidence for, or against this, it's not rational.\n\n I just did.\n \n \n \n \nWe have no evidence of existence of life other than off-earth, but we don't claim it exists.\n\n neither does an agnostic claim that god exists (or not).\n \n \nWe can logically discover evidence that proves it does.\n\n We have yet to do this.\n \n \nFor god, an unknowable, BY DEFINITION, there can be no evidence for or against, by definition, it's a logical contradiction. I hope that's more clear.\n\n By YOUR definition in this thread.\n Yes, it's clear, I got it last time.\n But, just because you defined god as such in this thread does not mean that an agnostic is \"hedging his bets\" or being a coward. An agnostic does not automatically ASSUME that god must always be unknowable since nothing has led him to beleive that. He's being honest in that he really doesn't have a clue.\n \n \nGiven that our knowledge of the universe (that we know exists?) is next to nothing relative to what (we think?) it contains then it's probable (not just possible?) that there is something outside what we know (or can know). \n \n \nMaybe, but you and I don't make claims about it as true. If we did, we'd be in irrational/illogical territory.\n\n\n But that's exactly what you are doing. \n You are making the claim that \"god definitely does not exist\" is a true statement. Since you have nothing solid to base that statement on, is that illogical/irrational?\n \n\n No, fundamental difference. You are referring to something extra-ordinary, or seemingly supernatural, or seemingly magical, etc. Supernatural is OUTSIDE the natural, by definition, something not only can we not comment on in terms of true or false, but cannot, by definition, exist. It cannot exist, and not-exist.\n\n Now I think i see a difference in perspective here.\n I'm defining \"supernatural\" as things that would lie outside our cosmos.\n I see now what you are saying.\n There really isn't anything that could be considered \"magical\" except by someone who is not familiar with the phenomenon.\n A caveman would probably think that a DVD player was \"magical.\"\n We would probably think that a trans-dimensional being that can pop in and out of our universe, do a few thing that are perfectly normal to him, and then pop out again would be magical or miraculous. \n To that being, it's like taking a walk.\n \n I think your definition of supernatural is just \"something that doesn't exist.\"\n \n \n \nDon't use the word god unless you define it. If you tell me you think god is knowable, and your definition of god is a knowable entity that exists, we can discuss this.\n \n I can't say \"God is definitely knowable\" nor can I say \"god is definitely unknowable.\" I can't give you any absolutes like that to latch onto, sorry.\n \n \nIf you tell me we don't know if god exists, and god is not knowable, then you are being irrational. You choose, not me, it's not a strawman, I clearly indicate what I'm talking about.\n\n Clear as mud. :)\n \n \n\n Doubt, unknowns, theories...all OK.\n Discussing contradictions as existing...illogical!\n\n Ok, logical contradictions can't exist (or can they? maybe not in this universe, but who knows?) but what we were talking about was not a logical contradiction.\n \n The only reason anything may be a logical contradiction in this thread is because you defined god in a certain way.\n \n \nGotcha again. You're making claims as true, that we do not have sufficent data [to prove or disprove the existence] of \"god\".\n\n ???\n You think we have enough information to determine whether god exists or not?\n I'm calling 20/20.\n Start writing. We'll publish ASAP.\n \n \nYour claim is either logical (in that god can have data to prove or disprove him), or not (god by definition is not observable, knowable, or beyond our universe, etc.).\n\n Losing me here, but I'll try to decipher it.\n God may or may not present us with data that would provide evidence for its existence in the future. As far as I know, there has been no such evidence or data that has been discovered. \n \n This is also the case for data or evidence that would prove that God does NOT exist. As far as I know, there has never been evidence that would difinitively rule out the existence of \"god.\"\n \n \nEvidence is not a luxury, it's implied when we discuss having knowledge of the existence of something!\n\n Evidence can be a luxury. Luxury is simply a convenience, something that makes our lives easier. Sometimes evidence of something really makes our lives easier, since it causes us to solve a problem.",

Many would have seen Him and the many miracles that He performed. Why bring up Jesus? Because He is, from the Bible, God the Son (a part of the Trinty, i.e. God the Father, Spirit and Son). God personally came down at Babel, in Egypt, and was with many men in the Old Testament, such as Jeremiah and people such as Peter and Paul in the New Testament. Also, He helped China's \"Heavenly Man\", Brother Yun, escape from a Chinese gaol (for Americans, gaol = jail) and preach to many Chinese peoples. These are just to name a few. \n \n B1: Making a claim that God exists, but is \"beyond knowledge\" is a logical contradiction.\n C1: If you claim to have knowledge of something that is \"beyond\" knowledge, it's a contradiction in plain english. I have knowledge of something that cannot be known. I have knowledge of something unknowable. Obviously a logical contradiction.\n \n I do not know of one who makes such claims, but even so, it is not a logical contradiction. Firstly, your statements about B1 and C1 are different, the claim does not have to be about \"knowledge\", what about \"beliefs\"? A person may state: \"I believe that there is a God, although He is beyond our limited human understanding\". What this person is saying is that they believe a God exists, although they do not know what features this God has, or the extent of his power and so on. Notice how this is different from C1, \"I have knowledge of a God, but he (or it) is beyond knowledge\". This is a contradiction, but the above statement about beliefs is not.\n \n \n B2: Making a claim that God exists, but cannot be observed (in principle), is a logical contradiction.\n C2: If you claim to know of the existence of some thing, but then claim that some thing cannot be observed (in principle), then it's another contradiction. I claim to have knowledge of something that I cannot by definition have knowledge of. Another unknowable, another contradiction.\n \n For B2, no, it is once again just believed by faith (not a logical contradiction). Actually, this claiming that something exists without observing it forms the basis of many scientific theories, including our present understanding of the atom and it's formation, quantum and quarks, etc. Big bang cosmology also uses such a thing when it proposes that the Oort Cloud exists but have not observed it. They make up a story about it's features and position while having not observed it! Aliens is another such example. By your definition, they too are a logical contradiction (if only the N.A.S.A thought like you! Your country would be far better off with the money that you would have after scraping these space missions to other planets and satellites to find E.T and the S.E.T.I project)!\n \n B3: Making a claim that God exists, outside of nature, is a logical contradiction.\n \n C3: If you claim something is beyond the natural universe, the conclusion is that it cannot be observed, since we can only observe, by definition, things within the natural universe. Once again, you claim to have knowledge that something exists, that cannot be observed by definition, another contradiction.\n \n \n Once again, not a contradiction, but faith. You appear to be very confused on this issue. We honestly do not know where \"Heaven\" is. But I do believe that God can, has and is still interacting with our universe and planet. The Bible out lines many such instances of this. The book, \"The Heavenly Man\" also out lines another such example in modern times where God is with a Christian known as Brother Yun (who served in China) and helps Brother Yun escape a Chinese gaol (gaol = jail). I also believe that what we call the laws of nature and the laws of science are man's attempt to describe the usual ways in which God acts on His creation (sustaining it). When He acts differently, a miracle occurs.\n \n We know about God through the Bible, which we believe to be the inspired Word of God. The Bible not only gives us man's origins, and the history of mankind, and more notably Israel, but it also gives us insight in God's power and love (grace, etc.) and the future where Jesus will return and create a new heaven and new Earth. These events are also believed out of faith.\n \n As a result of your failed attempts to discredit the faith (or belief) in God as illogical and contradictions, your conclusions are also false.\n \n Got to go, I hope that this made sense, I didn't get to proof read it.",

   " You claim this existing entity (which we let slide for now), is omniscient! You just used this as a premise.\n How did you arrive at this knowledge?! (you cannot logically)\n\n You're missing the point. Of course I'm using it as a premise. The God of Classical Theism is, believe it or not, omniscient. Therefore when Christians in particular speak of God, they propose Him to be omniscient. I was just showing that it would be absurd for them to claim that they \"know Him completely\". \n \n#1 you claim knowledge of the unknowable (that certain qualities of god\n are unknowable...this is a contradiction again)\n #2 that somehow part knowable, and part unknowable make the entitiy you\n claim has both qualities, logically possible, which is the exact same\n logical contradiction we're discucssing, a logical AND (has both\n knowable AND unknowable qualities) does not change the logical outcome\n anyway, so why bother trying that route.\n\n This is untrue, and wholly unjustified. Particularly the first point. \n \n Look, no-one is claiming knowledge of the unknowable, where \"unknowable\" means \"you cannot know anything about them\". It's quite easily to know of a being that has something that is temporarily or permanently unknown to you. For example, I shall never know what it is like to experience the world from your viewpoint. Does this now make you \"unknowable\"? \n \nYet we CANNOT do this, since you, or theists, or whoever, suggests that SOME of god is UNKNOWABLE.\n\n Sure they would. And you haven't shown the slightest actual problem with it, but rather, on the contrary, merely assumed it. \n \nIt seems to me that I know more than you do on the topic at hand, and of\n course, neither your point, nor this one, are relevant, you have yet to\n refute anything. If you had, it would be a clear, and concise,\n refutation of the logic or some other fallacy of mine, and as we see,\n there are no significant flaws.\n\n I'm sorry that you think that. Anyhow, it's irrelevant -- you can go on thinking that you know more, you merely haven't demonstrated so. [Note: perhaps safe to say that your statement above is not the case, after your demonstration of lack of knowledge in basic propositional logic. Sorry :()\n \nYou did NOT prove it's non-existence, you proved the statement was illogical, and we can proceed to then gather or reject evidence. We're not talking about 1+1, we're talking about claims of existence, which by definition, must have evidence, else, you're blowing hot air.\n\n Looooool. Wilder and wilder. Dude, take a course in propositional logic. We of course have the premise that a contradictory being/thing cannot exist in actuality. I have proved that it cannot exist. \n \nNotice in the above theistic implication that I mention the premise is:\n \n - God exists\n - but we don't have enough information to know god fully\n \n The premise of existence is the problem, you do not get to proceed to step2, information on existence, when by definition this god concept is non-existence.\n\n I do not know you fully, and I cannot, therefore you do not exist. QED. \n \nTricky theists...love to skip ahead :/\n\n Very very ironic, considering you've clearly and stealthily avoided the primary question set in my post -- the point that refutes your whole \"theory\". I showed that these two premises:\n \n B2: Making a claim that God exists, but cannot be observed (in principle), is a logical contradiction.\n B3: Making a claim that God exists, outside of nature, is a logical contradiction.\n \n Are false, and we have no real reason to accept either of them. I outlined it in my posts here, and in my posts in the other thread. Please don't reply unless you plan on answering those, since that's the whole topic of this thread.\n \nWe observe rocks.\n We observe rocks falling to the ground.\n we observe most things fall to the ground.\n we observe rocks have never NOT fallen unless something natural prevents it\n\n You're clearly not acquainted with the problems of empiricism and induction. Read some Hume, or just do a search for \"rock\" and and \"induction\" by me in the forum. I wrote quite a lot on it, should be easy to find. If you can't, LMK, and I'll dig it up for you. \n \n You are left with what we call \"faith\"..i.e. ignorance, lack of reason, insanity, call it what you will, it implies the same thing...nothing. unker is correct.\n\n When you are clearly the one using faith here by applying what you think reason to be, I'd say you were closer to it, so watch out! :)",

   "\n and 100 times (including now) the definition of \"atheist' is still ambigious. from this point on, i'll go along with your convention and use \"explicit atheist\" and \"agnostic\" only, since these are the only terms useful to me in this discussion. \n \n\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism\n Weak atheism, also known as implicit atheism, is the absence of belief concerning the existence of deities, without the positive assertion that they do not exist. A weak atheist may however claim that given sufficient lack of evidence, nonexistence is most likely. An argument commonly associated with the weak atheism position is that of rationalism: any claims and assertions, and the beliefs arising thereof, must be justified, and not taken on faith. Theists make the positive claim that a particular god and/or deities exist. Weak atheists do not assert the contrary, but merely withhold their assent from the theists' claim. Some weak atheists simply have no opinion on the issue, either because they have not considered it, or because they find the arguments and evidence more or less equally compelling on both sides. Others, having considered the arguments and evidence, may doubt the existence of deities but are unwilling to assert no deities exist. They may feel it is not possible to prove a negative; that the strong atheist has not fulfilled his burden of proof any more than the theist; and that faith is at present required to assert or deny theism, making both theism and strong atheism untenable. The epistemological position that it is not known, and possibly not knowable, whether or not deities exist is known as agnosticism. This view is not equivalent to weak atheism, as agnosticism can also be subscribed to by theists who hold their beliefs on faith. However agnosticism is often the basis for weak atheism, a position sometimes called agnostic atheism. For a discussion of agnosticism and its variants, see: agnosticism, weak agnosticism, strong agnosticism, agnostic atheism. \n \n \n Strong atheism,  also known as explicit atheism or positive atheism, is the position that no deities exist. This denial may be based on lack of evidence or sufficient grounds to justify belief in deities; or it may be based on an assertion that belief in the supernatural is not rational. It may also be based on a psychological understanding of the nature of faith and belief in a religious or spiritual context.",

   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism\n Weak atheism, also known as implicit atheism, is the absence of belief concerning the existence of deities, without the positive assertion that they do not exist. A weak atheist may however claim that given sufficient lack of evidence, nonexistence is most likely. An argument commonly associated with the weak atheism position is that of rationalism: any claims and assertions, and the beliefs arising thereof, must be justified, and not taken on faith. Theists make the positive claim that a particular god and/or deities exist. Weak atheists do not assert the contrary, but merely withhold their assent from the theists' claim. Some weak atheists simply have no opinion on the issue, either because they have not considered it, or because they find the arguments and evidence more or less equally compelling on both sides. Others, having considered the arguments and evidence, may doubt the existence of deities but are unwilling to assert no deities exist. They may feel it is not possible to prove a negative; that the strong atheist has not fulfilled his burden of proof any more than the theist; and that faith is at present required to assert or deny theism, making both theism and strong atheism untenable. The epistemological position that it is not known, and possibly not knowable, whether or not deities exist is known as agnosticism. This view is not equivalent to weak atheism, as agnosticism can also be subscribed to by theists who hold their beliefs on faith. However agnosticism is often the basis for weak atheism, a position sometimes called agnostic atheism. For a discussion of agnosticism and its variants, see: agnosticism, weak agnosticism, strong agnosticism, agnostic atheism. \n \n \n Strong atheism,  also known as explicit atheism or positive atheism, is the position that no deities exist. This denial may be based on lack of evidence or sufficient grounds to justify belief in deities; or it may be based on an assertion that belief in the supernatural is not rational. It may also be based on a psychological understanding of the nature of faith and belief in a religious or spiritual context.\n\n like i said in post #61, the \"weak atheist\" answers the question \"does God exist?\" in a form of \"i dont know\". he cannot claim that either God exists or that God doesnt exist, because he doesnt know. therefore he is agnostic. if a weak atheist is a form of agnostic, then the term is not needed, since \"agnostic\" already covers it",

   "I don't so much understand the statement. For example, would it be true -- for you -- to say that if we knew that God did indeed exist (since we know that He exists), is it correct now to say that He is \"knowable\". If you mean it like that, fine and dandy. If you don't, I guess it is too. Don't much care about how people are using it. \n\n yes, that would be true. the term \"knowable\" allows a lot of potential gray area. i'm saying that even if God's existence (or any other single attribute) is the only knowable aspect we can determine, then for practical purposes we can define God as knowable\n \n \nDo you agree that it would be possible to -- in theory -- make an argument based on reason (not percepetion/observation) to show that God exists (or doesn't)? I certainly think that it is possible, and if it is -- it answers the very question of this thread, as stated in the OP. That is, it destroys his argument there.\n\n yes i do. if we can define God as an entity in logical terms, even if not physical or observable, we can demonstrate if God per that definition exists. if we are working with reason, we must limits our points to the constraints of logical premises and methods. if God can be first defined in terms of logical premises, then yes it can be done.\n \n \nAlso, re: last part: believing is not the same as knowing. I wrote a couple of paragraphs fully explaining why they're not. Trying telling the doxastic logician that believing is the same as knowing. Quite absurd.\n\n i agree, and i would go further to say that believing is NOT knowing. if you claim you believe something is true, but you cannot claim that you KNOW so, then in effect you do NOT know that such is true\n \n \nNot stupid at all -- I appreciate you asking. Well, examples -- there are quite a few. Take Aristotle's Cosmological argument, Aquinas' five ways, the Teleological Argument, Ontological Argument, the \"problems of evil\"..... they all make attempts, based on reason, to show that God exists (or that He doesn't).\n\n echoed",

   "I'll show you. Keep in mind, it's fallacy because you're using it as refutation of my claim.\n \n Then I'l re-state your claims to analyze (Maybe later though, there seem to be a lot all at once!)\n =====\n \n me: God is unknowable\n me: to claim knowledge of god as \"existing\" is a logical contradiction.\n =======\n That's wrong because:\n \n you: God is part knowable\n you: God is part unknowable\n \n Me: We can test something you claim as knowable - < let's go test it (we do some research, call some people, think a lot, write stuff down, look at video footage, etc., etc.)\n\n i like this analysis. i just want to point out that if something is \"part knowable\", then technically it can be defined as \"knowable\". something that is unknowable is unknowable entirely. and even if that thing contains unknowable aspects, the thing itself is still knowable, since it also contains knowable aspects.\n \n \nMe: On your second claim, you claim knowledge of the unknowable, this is a logical contradiction, we're back to my first claim anyway, we just went the long way.\n ========\n\n again, this is true, except that if God is defined as knowable, then the argument goes the other way. it really depends on the definition, which, sadly, os hardly consistent\n \n \nSo, logically, on the whole, if god is part logical, and part illogical, god is illogical. Then we're back to my claim. But we dont' even have to combine them, we can just table your first claim (Part of god is knowable), then attack the second claim (part of god is not-knowable) with exactly the same logic.\n \n So you're either rejecting that god is entirely knowable.\n OR\n You are claiming god is in one or more ways, unknowable\n \n All roads lead to the same place. It's like saying I have a hammer.\n The hammer handle is made of wood, here, feel it, see it..it's real.\n BUT\n The head of the hammer is cannot be observed in any way, at any time.\n \n Does this \"hammer\" exist?\n \n No, if the hammer is both the handle, and the unobservable head, then logically the hammer, does not exist. Saying part, but not all, does not save the argument, it's not partially illogical, it's illogical.\n\n unknowable doesnt equate to illogical. God consisting of some unknowable aspects doesnt mean that he consists of illogical aspects\n \n \nAS to your other claims:\n Let's list them.\n cumulaitve god claims:\n \n 1. God is a person\n <2. God exists\n <3. God is \"knowable\" in that you \"know\" god exists, and is a person\n <4. You have sufficient, rational demonstratable evidence that god is a human being (or was?)\n 2. God is knowable (restated, OK)\n 3. God is not now visibly observable (is dead I assume you mean)\n 4. This dead human relates to you now\n 5. You throw in the teleological argument (bougs) for grins. I'll show you why mainstream philosphy, science, and logical folk, reject this argument in another post.\n 6. Worse, you claim that human observation is infallible, in that you claim to seemingly contradict observation is a logical contradiction (do I need to disprove this one? You're in the mental health field...even the most healthy and honest people are entirely fallible in all sensory and intellectual capacities. If we could use human observation to overturn logic, things would be chaotic, as you suggest. \n \n The scary thing is that faith, results in chaotic nonsense, while logic and reason promote order...exactly the opposite of what you claim.\n \n That's a lot of stuff all at once, I'll have to drum up more time this weekend.\n \n -Mach\n\n 3 begins a cascade of bad premises and conclusions. replace it with \n \n 3.

   "First of all I'd like to know how this supports the fact that you cannot assume something simply because you cannot prove its opposite, it seems you used logic, which is more valid than the assumption that it's true since you can't prove it's opposite, but on your logic:\n \n First of all 2 points are not sufficient for a line, a line contains an infinite amount of points, any 2 points define a line, there can't be more than one line through 2 points, but 2 points don't define a line. An infinite amount of parallel lines makes up a plane and an infinite amount of parallel planes makes space. So you could still make the point that an infinite amount of nothing makes something, except for the fact that infinity is only a concept. You can't have an infinite amount of something (or nothing for that matter). But the way we define length and area and such is we measure the distance in between these points. We define a line segment which is the space between 2 points (which have a location but don't take up space themselves, totally illogical, yet very useful). And then area is the space between 2 line segments or multiple line segments. And volume is the space between multiple \"plane segments?\" (whatever we call them). \n \n But what you state is still correct, just because you can't prove the positive doesn't mean you can assume the negative. Why did they ever try to invent an airplane, we couldn't prove we could get off the ground, so we have to assume it's impossible.\n\n \n An example of my point on not proving the opposite. \n \n Given: All cars are black.\n Opposite statement : No cars are black\n I cannot prove all cars are black, therefore no cars must be black. Over generalization.\n \n The point about points is that A basic postulate of math is that a point is a zero dimensional item. You cannot prove that it is zero dimensional. According to the logic being used in the argument I was refuting that would mean that points do not exist. They do exist. They are absolutely necessary for the world to function. Math has almost no meaning without that particular postulate. I cannot prove they exist. I must assume they exist and then math works. There are always basic assumptions which cannot be proven but are theorized. The inability to prove their existence does not PROVE their non existence. This is a basic logical principle.",

Math has almost no meaning without that particular postulate. I cannot prove they exist. I must assume they exist and then math works.

Inability for others to post there? I fail to understand why you don't just start a new thread if you want to start the debate over. Seriously, I don't know what you're getting at, please spell it out for me.\n\n If you didn't want to debate from the beginning you could have just said. Don't know why you went around avoidingly and now project some type of paranoia that I have some deeply hidden agenda for wanting to debate. It was a simple proposal, and I didn't really mind that you'd say no. I'll respond here. \n \nWhether you agree or not that the use the word \"unknowable\", is irrelevant to showing that for the sake of my argument, PART, or ENTIRELY, [supernatural, unknowable, omniscient] are shown to be contradictions the same exact way.\n\n This is plainly untrue. \n \n I have already shown that it is possible -- and practical -- to suggest that a being is \"knowable\" if we know certain parts of it. Many parts of Mach are unknowable to me (especially from my locality here, and me not knowing him in person), but I wouldn't wish to suggest that he's unknowable. I know certain things about Mach -- namely, that he posts on 4forums and is debating against me right now. Now, this paragraph is solely to show one thing: even though a being might have some unknowable qualities, I can still call you \"knowable\" (I see that you disagree that I cannot fully know you, so I've explained below).\n \n Secondly, Mach's claim that God is \"fully unknowable\" goes against Christian Tradition, and I don't know of a single theist willing to accept that premise. Therefore, Mach, you shouldn't be arguing that Christians claim that (which I hope you don't). \n \n Against the claim that \"supernatural\" equates \"unknowable\"\n \n Mach, you earlier made the presupposition that we can only know whether a being exists by observation and sensory perception. I showed why this was erroneous earlier, but I don't mind re-explaining. \n \n We earlier agreed on the definition of \"supernatural\" as something that is above the natural, or, in your terms -- something that cannot be observed. I think this definition is tricky (to be honest), but I am willing to accept it for this debate, and that's what matters. Throughout life, we are granted with our senses, but furthermore -- we're granted with reason and knowledge. Should we have only had our senses, life would be quite meaningless -- it's contradictory to suggest that all our knowledge comes from our senses (no, I'm not saying that you make this claim). \n \n Since you're acquainted (to a certain degree), with the Teleological argument, I'll speak about that one. We are both agreed that it fails to do what it sets out to do; that is, to prove the existence of a Supreme Being. However, the grounds on which we reject it are quite similar, too -- we disagree with the premise that there are necessarily things in this world that our designed (and we might disagree with some of the other premises). Now, let's just assume for a second, that this argument had its premise structured differently, and we were persons that accepted the premises. It's completely irrelevant that this is not the case in reality. \n \n If they were structured differently, then we could, in theory (this is really a key point. In theory) prove the existence or the non-existence of God (you claim that we cannot prove a negative... I'll get to that in a bit). What I'm trying to say here, is that the argument does not fail because God is unobservable. If we were to reason, then we could -- in theory -- show whether God exists or not. This is NOT to say that we can reason right now and necessarily find out that God exists; I'm simply saying that it's not impossible. Hence the use of \"in theory\". \n \nI have knowledge of the unknowable - therefore - I can have knowledge of the unknowable\n \n Rejected..well, isn't it obvious? We'll reduce it to absurdity, show how it cannot be proven, or disproven. Point in fact, you try to prove a negative...you should know this is illogical from the start.\n\n You speak of logic as if you are an authority on it, but speaking as someone who knows quite a bit about logic (propositional logic; modal logic in particular, and a few other fields), I suggest that some humble-pie is in order. \n \n The claim that \"one cannot prove a negative\" was a statement that came around by some 19th-20th century atheists who, when asked to prove God's non-existence, exclaimed, \"we can't! You can't prove a negative!\". It should be palpable the irony projected here. For one, the statement is a negative in itself -- so, by its own reasoning, it cannot be shown to be true. Secondly, it's no harder to prove a negative than a positive. Karl Popper would have suggested that you can only prove negatives, but that's a little strong. \n \n But anyhow, I'll prove a negative right now. I'll prove that the \"jakkim\" doesn't exist, and cannot ever exist. Let jakkim = a being that had ten legs and does not have ten legs. Contradiction. Being cannot exist. QED. See how easy that was? \n \n Furthermore, I should note that I have never made the statement that you have above there. \n \n Yet, this is once again, the same....exact...argument.\n Dreamweaver claims knowledge of the unknowable - it's a logical contradiction (yawn), it's thrown out.\n\n Once again, this is untrue because as I have shown earlier, a being can possess permanently unknowable qualities (such as Mach does), and I can still claim to \"know\" him. I see no logical reason for why it should not be the same with God.\n \n To suggest you CAN prove a negative (contradictory), reduces to the\n absurd (as it must, since it's incorrect).\n\n I assure you that it is entirely untrue to say that \"you cannot prove a negative\", and that furthermore, there hasn't been the slightest shred to back that claim up. \n \n How do you intend to prove your claim true, that there are things about me or god, we can rationally demonstrate, that you cannot, in principle know?\n Please, back your claim, else, we cannot take it as true.\n\n Very easily. Let's take you for example. I can never know about everything that you experience, nor how you experience it. If I had all of your experiences (and yours alone, because adding more would mean that they're not just yours), then I would be you. I am not you, and when we experience the same event, we will experience it differently, but this isn't the point. The point is that I'll never have the sum of your life experiences, ever. I would have had to have been in the same point at the same time of everyone one of your experiences. \n \n Claiminig knowledge of the unknowable, be it supernatural, omniscience, etc., etc. is logically contradictory, as demonstrated over and over.\n\n You make this claim often, so I want to be sure when I'm rebutting it. When people say that \"I know X\", as in, \"I know Mach\" it's perhaps not full. It means to say that I know certain things about you. And hence unkerpaulie's claim that if we can know something about someone, for all practical reasons, they're knowable. If it's really that troublesome, then just take \"God is knowable\" to mean \"Certain things about God are knowable, and certain things about the rock are unknowable\". \n \n How absurd can you get? Here is where your bogus arugment leads, when taken as true:\n \n Mach can prove as true, that a monkeyhamadoodle exists, with no observable/sensable evidence.\n\n We can, IN THEORY, show that a monkeyhamadoodle exists/doesn't exist if we had enough information. This information is a key idea -- we would have to know things about how it's defined, where it would exist (if we couldn't have access to it) etc.. I don't see why you're having a problem suggesting that we could, in theory, have evidence of supernatural being, but we can indeed.\n \n Take the scriptural argument. Again, it doesn't matter whether the scriptures are inspired in reality or not (for my point now). Presuming that they were, and say, presuming that the Being had left this book for us so that we can know things about it, then ipso facto, we know things about it, without have direct sense-perception of it. \n \n Hogwash. No faith-based claims of existence today. We'd be able to prove Santa Claus exists..lol..\n\n Then I encourage you to show that he exists.\n \n Part of X is not knowable.\n - therefore\n All of X is known to me.\n \n That's what you're agreeing. I don't have to point out that it's illogical, but I just did.\n\n No-one in this debate has ever claimed this, and I certainly don't. By saying something is \"knowable\" I don't mean that \"all of x is knowable to me\". I suggest that you stop disillusioning yourself that you're on the case for logic here (you're not), and start reading your interlocutors' arguments. If you wanted to have a propserous debate, you would, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you have.",

Part or whole, it matters not.\n \n \n If instead you start with EFs proposal \"god is a human\". Then it's not a contradiction (yet). By definition, the implications of being human are known to us. If you proceed to then say, \"this human, god, has qualities that I know cannot be known, in principle\"..you're back to contradiction. Take your pick. Contradiction at definition or at the follow-on claims of qualities.\n \n \n Now, just apply your (bad) analogy to the same framework to see it fail.

This is to be what...accepted? Nonsense.\n \n Now, if you claim instead I have some qualities that are currently UNKNOWN to you, this is possibly logically consistent. \n \n So which is it dreamweaver? Do you claim to have knowledge about me that cannot in principle be known? How would we falsify it unless could prove it true or false? We should just take your word for it, on a whim? Of course not.

Which is appropriate, since god is indeed non-existence, but I digress.\n \n Knowledge implies rational justification, you cannot rationally justify something that does not exist, you cannot claim something exists without first existing yourself, then observing.\n \n Here's another example, a direct question, to test your claim, let's go ahead and define X:\n \n YAMMER: A being that cannot be observed or detected in any way, ever.

OK, how do you propose we gain knowledge of the existence of a YAMMER? Do they exist? Do they not exist? \n \n Of course you cannot, it's absurd, and so is this line of refutation. This is why you throw out many refutations, and not just a single root fallacy as the lynch pin to my logical contstruct. That's because there isn't any. You don't agree with the teleological argument, yet you offer it up too as refutation of a contradiction? Come on, tell me there is some root issue that we can analyze in a clear, concise manner. Posting refutations that #1 you don't agree with, and that #2 even if accepted do not change the logical outcome, is just a waste of my time. Is that your goal? To befuddle me with rhetoric until I throw up my hands? I hope not...because we won't get that far.\n \n -Mach",

   "Mach, your argument is changing (or \"evolving\") even if you don't notice it. Unfortunately, these changes are still false.\n \nFrom what I keep reading, you seem to be claiming that #2 is logically valid\n\n You are either selectively reading, or have terrible reading skills. I'm sorry. I couldn't have made it clearer in my last post that I'm not stating this. \n \nNow, if you claim instead I have some qualities that are currently UNKNOWN to you, this is possibly logically consistent. \n\n Finally! Thank the Lord; glad to see that you can now see it. Though, of course, you have qualities that are forever uknown to me. Qualities that, if I had, I would be you and not me. \n \nDo you claim to have knowledge about me that cannot in principle be known? How would we falsify it unless could prove it true or false? We should just take your word for it, on a whim? Of course not. Can you provide evidence for the qualities you claim I have? \n\n I wish you'd read my post. I did exactly this in my last post. \n \nBut wait, are you claiming this instead?\n \n Dreamweaver claims Mach is part knowable, part unknowable.\n Dreamweaver feels pretty sure Mach must be an existing human (given the evidence).\n \n Therefore, we can know the unknowable since we know Mach. (!)\n ^^^ \n \n Check your first premise, it's illogical. \n\n Claiming this... obviously not. Enough of these strawmans. \n \nKnowledge REQUIRES existence.\n\n Yes, but that's obvious. Existence precedes knowledge. \n \nDreamweaver, you are suggesting that we can gain knowledge of existince of X, without any senses to gather such knowledge from (ever).\n \n Please explain.\n\n Well, done it multiple times. A copy and paste: (if you don't understand, say how my explanations didn't help, rather than asking me to explain something that I already have):\n \n Since you're acquainted (to a certain degree), with the Teleological argument, I'll speak about that one. We are both agreed that it fails to do what it sets out to do; that is, to prove the existence of a Supreme Being. However, the grounds on which we reject it are quite similar, too -- we disagree with the premise that there are necessarily things in this world that our designed (and we might disagree with some of the other premises). Now, let's just assume for a second, that this argument had its premise structured differently, and we were persons that accepted the premises. It's completely irrelevant that this is not the case in reality. \n \n If they were structured differently, then we could, in theory (this is really a key point. In theory) prove the existence or the non-existence of God (you claim that we cannot prove a negative... I'll get to that in a bit). What I'm trying to say here, is that the argument does not fail because God is unobservable. If we were to reason, then we could -- in theory -- show whether God exists or not. This is NOT to say that we can reason right now and necessarily find out that God exists; I'm simply saying that it's not impossible. Hence the use of \"in theory\". \n \n2. I claim I can have knowledge of the existence of things which cannot be sensed ( in principle).\n \n Obviously #2 is a contradiction. \n\n OBVIOUSLY! Sure. If it's so obvious, please demonstrate it. You might have a little trouble with it, though, considering that I demonstrated the opposite to be the case.\n \nKnowledge implies rational justification, you cannot rationally justify something that does not exist, you cannot claim something exists without first existing yourself, then observing.\n\n Completely irrelevant. No idea why you've now gone into Cartesian doubt and its conclusions. \n \nYAMMER: A being that cannot be observed or detected in any way, ever. This definition was NOT constructed from having observed a YAMMER, since indeed a YAMMER cannot be observed.\n \n You claim you can know one exists, since you claim you can know without observation of some kind. OK, how do you propose we gain knowledge of the existence of a YAMMER? Do they exist? Do they not exist? \n\n Missing the point, again. I said that we could, in theory. There's nothing stopping us from applying reason to this being. Sure, we don't know much about that being. However, I have already given you a full-out demonstration of a scenario in which it is possible to prove the existence (or rather, non-existence in my example) of a being that we might not necessarily have any sensory-perception of. \n \nYou don't agree with the teleological argument, yet you offer it up too as refutation of a contradiction?\n\n The reason we're not \"getting far\" is because you don't seem to be reading my posts. I said I reject the teleological argument, but -- or rather, BUT -- it is not rejected on the principle that we \"cannot see God, therefore He doesn't exist\" (which is close enough to your argument; no sense-access to him, rather). \n \nFirst, you misinterpereted what I claim.\n \n All knowledge of the existence of things ORIGINATES with observation. \n\n This is not what you were claiming originally. I can quote you, if you like. You were consistently equating \"unobservable\" with \"uknowable\".",

The concept of Jiklob.\n\n Yes, it's a conceptual being (hence us talking about it). Vacuous point. The part in bold is completely unsubstantiated. Prove me wrong and substantiate it. \n \n PS. I already told you my opinon on winning vs losing, logic vs rhetoric. Please don't make claims about me personally, especially when I've already explained my thoughts on the matter for your own edification.\n\n I'm just sorry I held you to your word. Saying it is one thing; doing it is another. \n \n Anyhow, for your benefit, here's the conclusion (\"my claims\"): (Note: I have provided evidence for each one of these claims. If you reject any of them, you'll have to provide evidence and substantiation. Merely rejecting them doesn't stand; we care about substantiated claims here.)\n \n 1. Saying something is \"knowable\" and saying it's \"entirely knowable\" are two entirely different things. I'd say woman are knowable to me, but not entirely knowable. I cannot experience various things that happen to them; namely, child birth. \n 2. Unobservable does not mean unknowable. \n 3. I would claim that God as a concept would be, as most things are, partly knowable and partly unknowable (some things that we cannot know about God, that is). This is not a contradiction. \n \n Well, really, that's it. Those go against the OP, and through the evidence and reasoning above, I'd say I adequately refuted yours. \n \nYou cannot offer something contrary to logic, and claim it's true soley with a book written by humans, that profess to have \"observed\" this something.\n\n Though your entire reasoning on historical accuracy has much to be desired, I'd like you to substantiate this claim right here.

Something in the past..i.e. something that is no longer able to be known (not knowable)\n \n You are suggesting that we accept something contrary to what we know about reality, based on what's written in a book, by humans, with unknown motives, and frankly, a book that is debated about in every way, by philosophers throughout history, in terms of it's relevance to reality, it's consistency, it's basis in fact, and the motives behind it's writing.\n \n You cannot offer something contrary to logic, and claim it's true soley with a book written by humans, that profess to have \"observed\" this something. The past is not observable, and thus, is not sufficient evidence for refuting what we know in detail about how the universe works.\n \n If you DID accept that, you'd have to basically accept ANY AND ALL words written in books that claim to have knowledge of things that contradict reality.\n \n For example, if you pick up a book written about psychic powers of someone who was alive in the 50's, you'd have to accept such claims as true, since indeed it was written, and observed. Likewise, if I wrote a book now that at 6:56pm CST 12-06-2005, I saw the sun god Ra, but he's now gone. We'd have to take that as truth, based on this post, which is \"evidence\" of the existinece of Ra (it's not, and please don't accept that).\n \n That's not to say perhaps some things in the bible might be enjoyable for you, even inspirational.

Saying something is \"knowable\" is NOT saying that it's \"entirely knowable\", despite what you think. I gave numerous examples in my last post. \n \n \n One of three of your conclusions, see below.\n \n \nDefinitions are not assertions; definitions do not have truth-values. If we define A with A -< ~A then that's perfectly acceptable -- we're defining A as a contradiction. You should also learn more about premises; you can do very much with an logically contradictory premise. Namely, show that it's logically contradictory. Do you see your mistake now?\n\n \n No, please don't deny the logic, any and all can see it:\n \n \nProof of non-existence, as before:\n Jiklob -- a being that has unlimited knowledge and has no knowledge. \n I know that this being does not exist, since its existing would entail a logical contradiction. I have not reached this conclusion by any of my \"senses\" or by any sense-perception. Take note.\n\n \n Dreamweaver, you tried to construct a logical proof using an illogical premise. You cannot proceed with the proof, the proof is logically invalid. I know being in error might sting, get over it, we all make mistakes, and will continue to do so. You can be human, and correct it however. If you need me to make a mistake to lessen the ego-issue, just PM me.\n \n \nYes, it's a conceptual being (hence us talking about it). Vacuous point. The part in bold is completely unsubstantiated. Prove me wrong and substantiate it. \n \n \n No, it's not a vacuous point, if you want to be correct. Allow me to demonstrate again:\n \n Mach claims this is not based on observation of reality, so it's not a \"being\",\n \n First, your previous proof is invalid as evidenced by your contradictory premise, so this is an irrelevant point, and is a waste of our time.\n For you, I'll explain it, again however.\n \n X must either be living being, or not a living being (a concept). Let's examine your argument with the illogical contradiction removed, with these two opposite claims, so we can make sense of this:\n \n Premise modified so X is a living being\n \n P: X is a living being\n P: X can logically exist\n - therefore\n X is a living being that exists\n \n Circular, P1 already presupposed X is a living, existing being. Further, possibility is not proof of existence. So this is a a proof of nothing, your premise is what needs the proving.\n \n If instead you change it to a concept, then claim the concept exists, you end up with:\n \n Premise modified so Z is conceptual\n \n Premise: Suppose a conceptual being, we call Z.\n Premise: A living being with characterstics defined by Z can logically exist.\n - therefore\n A living being with characteristics defined by Z can possibly exist\n \n OK. So what do we need to know if a living being characterized by concept Z actually exists? Aha, evidence, just like everything else in reality. Which is what I claim you need, evidence. see how it all actually DOES make sense?

The Christian god is full of contradicting properties. For example, the Christian god is defined as being both just and merciful. Just implies that he enacts the exact punishment that an individual deserves, while merciful implies that he enacts a lesser punishment than what an individual deserves. In a similar manner, a shape cannot have a perimiter/diameter ratio of both 4 and 3.14 at the same time.\n \n So the empirical arguments for God's existence are just as absurd as saying, \"A round square made my watch, and I know this because I read about it in a book, and something must have created my watch.\"",

Throughout this entire debate, you haven't provided the smallest shred of evidence of why something can't be \"partly knowable\" and \"partly uknowable\". Either you're completely misunderstanding what every single member in here is implying by it, or you're just ignorant of the case in point. \n \n \n Ah yes, more false claims and personal attacks. I have shown my clear logical proofs, where exactly your errors are, what law of logic they violate, the general form so you can attempt a rebuttal, but you don't, you just fabricate lies (Mach has not provided the smallest shred of evidence) that are not only incorrect, but EXACTLY opposite of the truth. I realize this is how sophistry works, but I reject it, as I rejected your proven false claims.\n \n Please stop using personal attacks, it's against forum rules, and it's tiresome.\n \n -Mach",

So, in fact, it doesn't have the slightest relevance there; you would be referring to the Law of Noncontradiction, and your statement \"It must be true, or false, not both\" is a quasi-bivalence and quasi-Exclusive Disjunction for Contradictories rule; research them both to find out why it's a combination of both, kind of.\n \n Anyhow, no, it doesn't contradict anything in the slightest to say that it's \"partly knowable\" and \"partly unknowable\".

   "My opinion is that this line of discussion is a little silly, but I'll move forward with it anyway to make a point.\n \n 1) You state in post #131 that I made a claim when you state, \"Your claim is irrelevant to the discussion.\" However, I made no claim in the previous post to which you were responding. I stated a suspicion. I formed a hypothesis. One that is testable. (A question rather than a conclusion. Questions that I am interested in having you answer.)\n \n 2) The concept of relevance is, in itself, a subjective statement. It is in the eye of the beholder. It is possible for one person to see a very relevant connection where another person sees none. Therefore a statement about the relevance of my comments is your opinion. This is all I claimed in post #132 when I stated, \"These are, of course, your opinions -- to which you are, of course, entitled.\"\n\n \n The concept of relevance is not entirely subjective. There is a subjective experience to it. But there is also an objective reality. Words have meanings for a reason. Logic is one of those.\n \n \n3) To show how I believe my comments in post #130 are relevant:\n --< You state, \"I can conclude that God exists based on experience. I have tested it in my own life and found it true. I know others as well that have the same experience.\"\n --< Then I state, \"How have you performed these tests? Are they replicable? Are there any other reasonable conclusions that you perhaps did not consider?\"\n These are simple and direct questions to a claim that you made in post #129 of this thread. If my question is deemed irrelevant to the discussion, then I fail to see how your claim can be considered relevant.\n\n \n Your questions about somethings objectivity or subjectivity concern the premise or premises. These are merely the premises. Logic is the process by which we reach conclusions. Our conclusions are perfectly logical based on subjective experience. I pointed out some mathematical examples to which we have a premise which cannot be proven, but our subjective experieince suggests its validity. I cna then logicall draw conclusions based on those premises.\n \n \nI would like to put another thought to you for discussion...\n EF: [My conclusions about the existence of God are] \"Quite subjective. ... Mach argued that claims about God are illogical. They are not illogical. Subjectivity is not illogical, it is merely subjective. Logic is a process to analyze data. It is equally valid for objective and subjective data.\n \n We have here, you claiming that 'claims about God are not illogical, but that they are subjective.' Do you believe it is logical to use a subjective belief (the belief that your experiences are evidence for God) as a premise to form an objective conclusion (an entity 'God' exists in reality)? If so, please walk me through your logic.\n \n Peace,\n The Bootfitter\n\n \n As stated above, it is perfectly logical and reasonable to draw conclusions based on subjective premises. Provided that they are tested. I have tested them. Others have as well.\n \n Now, to answer your questions. Yes it is replicable. But it requires a qualitative change within the individual. several have intimated that unless they can see it first, they will not believe it. I say that it is replicable, but you have to believe it first and then you will see it. This is the nature of unseen reality. It is true for any physical phenomenon which we cannot directly observe, but can be observed in the effects. \n \n We cannot directly observe black holes, naked singualrities, worm holes etc. but we can deduce their existence from their effects. Same with Quarks. Same with the concept of infinity. We see their effects, we posit they exist, we test them for ourselves. God is no different. We see his effects (the lives of others, statements of others etc.) we posit he exists, we test it in our own lives.\n \n It is perfectly logical. \n \n All that said, that is not what is actually being argued, which is why I said the point was irrelevant. The point is not whether or not the results are replicable. The point is whether or not it is logical to make claims about God. The answer is YES it is perfectly LOGICAL. That is because logic is a process by which we draw conclusions. To argue that the premises are wrong is irrelevant. The issue concerns the process by which the conclusions are drawn. It is the process, not the beginning point that is at issue. It is what I am arguing. You may be arguing whether or not God exists. That is irrelevant to whether or not it is LOGICAL (process) to make a claim about God.\n \n EF",

   "Mach:\n \n You have not shown that for anything to be known at all it must be completely known. This is simply ridiculous, especially when you consider sentience.\n \n People are known and unknown. There are some things about me you know. You know I believe in God. You don't know lots and lots about me. It would be impossible for you to know everything about me. You don't even know everything about yourself let alone another. \n \n To say that God is known in part and not known in part is not a logical contradiction. It is simply true. You are trying to base your entire argument on this point.\n \n Also, to say that making any claims about God is illogical is an illogical thing to do. I have made this clear, and I believe dreamweaver has also stated the same thing. You have not refuted one mathematical argument except one person did say \"they are concepts.\" Hardly a refutation.\n \n I would say that you have easily lost this argument as you claim contradictory premises and yet cannot show how they contradict. Your argument boils down to \"its obvious\". Not what you said but it is a distillation. \n \n You ask dreamweaver to tell you what parts of God are unknown. Do you even hear the question you are asking. That is like me saying I don't know the brown headed guys name and you asking me to tell you what his name is. God is infinite. People are finite. We do not know everything about anybody. They are known in part and unkown in part. How much more is this true with one who is infinite.\n \n You say, \"all knowledge other than self, of existence is arrived at through the sense, either directly or inderectly.\" Directly or indirectly through the senses. The senses by their nature are subjective (because they belong to individuals and because they must pass through interpretation in the brain). God can and has been observed both directly and indirectly. In ancient times directly (we accept what is in the bible on this point, if you don't that is another topic). Indirectly through the lives touched by God. There are millions upon millions of individuals who will provide such a cloud of witnesses that you could not stand the scrutiny. The death of Christ has touched far more lives than anything on the planet. The bible is the single most printed book ever.\n \n These are all effects. They are all observable. \n \n Lastly, you have not argued any point concerning logic as a process. Regardless of the existence of God or not, the effects exist. To make claims about God based on those effects is entirely logical. That is what the title of the thread is isn't it. To make claims about gods is illogical. Show the fallacy in making a claim. Put a name to the fallacy. that is how it is illogical. \n \n If what you are trying to say is that people have no basis to make those claims, that is a different topic than saying people who come to the conclusions they do about God are not being logical. They are distinctly different subjects.\n \n If I were judging the debate between you and dreamweaver (and yes I could be considered biased, but have had plenty of debate training, double ruby in the national forensic league and all) I would vote resoundingly for dreamweaver, because you succumb to the strawman argument. You don't show how it is not a strawman, you say only that it is not and to look at your posts. I have looked and your logic is lacking.\n \n On this note, I will bow out of this debate as we seem at an impasse. I have enjoyed the discussion. Even if you don't like what I have said, consider that I may be correct and study logic some more. Perhaps even read some of the new testament. Perhaps read some Neitsche (sic?).\n \n Have a good one.\n \n Ef",

   "\n Means this thread is not about existince in the slightest (!!!!!!!!!!!! kidding of course)\n\n You're being silly and just making a fool of yourself. If the OP stated that God's existence would be an assumption of a particular person (and you saying how you counter CLAIMS about God), I need merely to show that your reasoning/premises are well-off, which they clearly are. Whether God exists in actuality is of little consellation; I don't need to show that God exists to disprove your claim by showing your premises to be irrational.\n \n No, I said, again: (post #152, among others)\n all knowledge other than self, of existence is arrived at through the sense, either directly or inderectly. \n \n Do not continue to misrepresent my posts. You can quote me if you forget the wording.\n\n Hah! You changed that very sentence multiple times. Anyhow, you are yet to disprove that we can \"know of something's existence through reason\". Take a whack at it. Saying, \"I don't konw of any case that that happens\" will NOT cut it. Fallacious argumentation. After you haven't provided reasoning for why we can't reason to know whether something exists, I'll give you an example (other than God ;)). Wow. Something to look forward to.\n \n By your reasoning we can never make arguments against logical contradictions. How very absurd. Let's embrace insanity while we have the choice to, too, then.\n \n Nonsense, you begin your theoretical proof with a logical contradiction. Please try again.\n\n What is nonsense is that you know next to nothing of logic and are aprading as if you do. LOGIC is applied in the INFERENCES. It's perfectly fine to have an argument where the premise is LATER shown to be logically contradictory. We gather the premises, and THEN we apply LOGIC to them. INFERENCES. Key word for you; geez, you would have thought I was teaching kindergarden. Just go and learn the formulation of a deductive axiomatic argument.\n \n Or have you forfeited? \n\n Yes, I've forfeited since your superior logic, knowledge and reasoning skills have shown me to be entirely erroneous consistently through the debate. Would you be happier if I wrote that on a certificate for you? Please grow up. \n \n I'm more than happy to stop debating with you (I don't think there's any hope), but you persist.",
