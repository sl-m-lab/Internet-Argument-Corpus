   "Here is a pretty good example of why so many people seem to freely endorse a \"clean\" environment, without considering the cost.\n \n www.kypost.com/news/2000/spill052200.html \n \n This is a brief news story about a spill, with enough basic detail LEFT OUT to keep almost anyone reading it from asking some important questions.\n \n I have the prestigious job of hauling dirt for a living. :p That doesn't make me an expert on excavation, but it's enough for me to ask a few questions.\n \n The general manager of Clean Harbors, an environmental clean up contractor, was \"unwilling to estimate the cost\". I wonder why? Wouldn't that be part of his job? Estimating the cost would largely be estimating the cost of excavation, hardly rocket science. The amount of dirt is measured in cubic yards. The cost of \"disposal\" would also figure in. Wouldn't he know something about that? I once hauled dirt out of a chemical plant that was doing some new construction, and the landfill automatically assumed that the dirt was slightly \"contaminated\". They had me dump it with all the rest of the \"non contaminated\" dirt. The only difference was the price tag. $300 per load, or about $30 per cubic yard. That's my only experience, but it could be applied here. I don't think there is a machine yet that separates dirt and diesel fuel. The honeyed word \"disposal\" simply means loading it up and dumping it somewhere on the same planet. We can't make it disapear, or send it into outer space.\n \n So lets conservatively figure $30 per cubic yard, and the information they give, and see what we come up with. 40' X 80' - darn, they didn't tell us how deep. Since it's twice as long one way, we can assume that's the way the truck was moving as the fuel was spilling. Since they went 20 feet each way out to the sides of a stream of fuel probably an inch or two wide, would it be safe to say they went down 3 feet? Probably more like 6 or 9 feet, but lets say 3. About 350 cubic yards. Times $30 per yard - hey we're started $10,500. An average tri-axle dump truck hauls about 10 yards. This news story implies that this job was done in just a few days. One dump truck didn't do all that - it took a fleet of them. Remember it all had to be backfilled, and it's hard telling how far they had to go to get new dirt, as well as the environmentally approved \"disposal\" site. Dump trucks have a lot of operating cost, lot of government regulations, fuel excise tax, sky high insurance for the trial lawyers, etc. My tri-axle licence renewal costs $1300 per year. Cha ching - $6000 for dump trucks. We're now at $16,000 and we're still just getting a good start. \"State environmental officials have been notified\", they have to eat. A new backhoe costs about $100,000, and it's \"crew\" needs health insurance. \n \n How many people, when reading that last line \"it's not going to be cheap\", had a clue that it was a $30,000 or more job? How many times do trucks spring a leak in their fuel tanks all across the country on any given day? When it's \"cleaned up\" and \"disposed of\", is anything really acomplished other than hauling it from one place to another, anything except a lot of money changing hands? \n \n A couple of hundred gallons of diesel fuel is worth $30,000, yet billions of tons of road de-icing chemicals are no problem? \n \n It seems that anyone who questions these things are immediately labeled \"anti-environment\" by liberals. Common sense should trump peoples' fear of labels. So many don't worry about it - someone else pays for it they think. Our WHOLE society pays dearly for it. Added up over a decade, I'll bet it would dwarf the cost of the Iraq war.",

   "A similar sham is the recycling of personal rubbish picked up at residences by contracted trash haulers in many cities. People are urged to separate plastic, glass and paper items into color keyed containers. Special trucks are designated to run the same routes as the regular trash/garbage trucks to pick-up the separated trash. When hauled to the trash exchange point (where route trucks dump their loads for cartage to land fills or recycling points), the separated trash is dumped according to commodity market prices. If plastic/glass/paper prices are at a level that makes money hauling them to a re-cycler, they remain separated. If prices are under the defined point of economic gain, as they normally are, the separated trash goes to the land fill. Politically it looks and sounds good. But, as usual, economics dictate environmental actuality. And, as usual, the consumer picks up the tab for political correctness and feels good about being the fool.",
