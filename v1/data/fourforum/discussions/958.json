   "An eye for make believe.\n \n Some people have declared that our eyes, if the part of a designer, are poorly designed. I don't see this. What I do see is an eye that allows us to enjoy beauty, art etc. Sure, we don't have X-ray vision, but our eyes are good enough. (I mention X-ray vision; what basis do people lay claim that our eyes aren't good enough; that we can't see through walls?)\n \n If we can now focus on possible evolutionary path-ways for the eye, we will see that evolutionaries have an eye for make believe.\n \n The classic case (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html) Darwin looked at several existing eye structures, and suggested that this progression of simplest to more complex types of eyes might be suggestive of a path taken in human eye evolution.\n \n Firstly, the core word is 'might'. Thus it is not the all conclusive proof Darwinists would suggest. Where is the evidence that random changes did occur as they say? What caused these changes? Why were they only positive changes? As Michael Behe points out there's enormous complexity in re-arranging the DNA just to get a depression...Behe, M, \"Darwin's Black Box\", p16ff. Where is the molecular explanation?\n The Darwinist say...\"Every change had to confer a survival advantage, no matter how slight.\" Why? What about dead-ends? What about negative mutations?\n \n What Darwin has shown is what we can call 'conceptual evolution'.The logic behind this is akin to showing a series of pictures: skateboard, bicycle, motor-bike, motor car, etc. We can see that they get more complex, but did the design for a car stem from that of a skateboard? We see the connection between these things (eyes, vehicles etc) because we organise it in our brains... but I'm not going to explain perceptual organisation. \n \n There are other explanations (http://www.biol.lu.se/funkmorf/vision/evolution.html) The Lund Vision Group shows computer modelling to suggest how a complex human eye could evolve (see under Computer Modelling)\n \"the structures of a focused camera type eye can evolve in less than half a million generations\" (Ibid.)\n Wow that's quick... so in all that time we're to assume that they went around with mutations that still hadn't quite produced a working eye. It's a shot in the dark, but it might work, providing that the intervening generations didn't need proper vision! \n \n In just six diagrams we get a model of the eye. This is again a case of conceptual evolution... seeing patterns that are meaningless unless you draw a connexion between them. Richard Dawkins is so impressed with this that he features the image on his web-page.\n \n The fraud is more clearly seen at http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/creation/eye_stages.html\n \n If you look at the few diagrams here, starting with a light sensitive patch, moving to a more complex eye, we can see the deception of using a rubbery model. The thin line at the top of the light-sensitive spot does not change in each model, yet in the end is the lens! The light-sensitive spot wouldn't have a lens... so the one little line which remains the same in each picture represents in fact vastly different things.",

   "Richard Dawkins claims that the eye is, by fact that it is poorly designed, proof against a creator.\n \n This is an interesting logical flaw. By stating a subjective view of an eye as a conclusive proof he has left hismelf open to attack.\n \n How is the eye 'flawed'? He claims because it is 'poorly wired'. But the eye does function, and does so quite admirably.\n \n Further, by stating that he can see a 'poor design' likewise we can now look for 'good design' to discern a designer!\n \n \n That is to say, if he can show that some things have evolved, simply by how they are put together, we can now look at how all thigns are put together in order to see if there is proof of a good order, and therefore a good design, therefore a designer.\n \n Thanks Dawkins!",

   "Barbarian on the numerous transitional organisms:\n Yes, the argument was that they didn't exist, but in fact they exist in large numbers. If you doubt this, try suggesting any stage in the evolution of eyes, and I can find you that stage in living organisms. \n \n \nIndeed, but they're not linked.\n\n \n No, you're wrong about that, too. For example, if we see a series of eyes in different organisms, the anatomical links will always also have genetic and molecular links as well (and often other supporting information). So the fact that we get the same phylogenies from several independent sources of evidence clearly shows that they are transitionals.\n \n \nIt's like I can find using any number of groups of buildings a pattern matching a particular zodiacal sign and then claim that the world's cities were set out governed by the stars - finding patterns in randomness.\n\n \n If you want it to match the situation with transitional organisms, every set of buildings would have pictures of the constellation in every room of every building, and each building would have a name that directly linked it to the constellation. Then it would be a good mapping. But if all that was true, you would have a very hard time saying that the links were imaginary, wouldn't you?\n \n Barbarian on transitionals:\n Of course they are. And they give lie to the assertion that eyes could not have evolved. The very stages that creationists deny could exist are found in still-living organisms. \n \n \nHow do they? If I find unrelated groups of animals and rearrange them according to eyes, I could indeed establish a pattern... with some simpler animals with more complex eyes coming after man.\n\n \n You could only do it one way. You see, the anatomical, genetic, and molecular data only matches up one way. There's a pattern, but it's not something you can determine. You can only collect enough data to find it. If you doubt this, try making a series using different phyla and see how well it works.\n \n Barbarian, regarding the intermediate nature of transistionals:\n Nonsense. They are, by creationists' own admission, incomplete; there are many obvously primitive eyes in all stages of development. \n \n \nHow do you know?\n\n \n I've seen them.\n \n Barbarian observes, regarding which population is evolving in any particular direction:\n No one can say for any particular population, although we know that there is preadaptation for one more primary color in humans. Whether or not that preadaptation is actually going to evolve one more usable receptor is not clear.\n \n \nI don't know what this relates to\n\n \n One set of cones in humans has two slightly different forms, with slightly different response to frequencies. If this became more pronounced, humans would evolve a fourth primary color.\n \n Barbarian on th evolution of eyes:\n On the other hand, we can see that it has happened in vertebrates, mollusks and annelids, among others. \n \n You are using what is termed \"denial\". The very things that creationists declared could not exist, and hand to exist if evolution was true, are found in living organisms. Pulling back the goal posts this late in the game isn't going to help.\n \n \nNope. One did not evolve from another.\n\n \n Keep in mind what a transitional is. Living transitionals clearly are not the ancestors of other living organisms. They merely retain a more primitive form that is transitional to more evolved forms. How do we know they evolved? Because, remember, we have the other evidence to verify it. Genetics, anatomy, molecules, etc.\n \n \nLet's use a series that did. You need to find transitionals, with evidence of evolution from one to the next.\n\n \n Sure thing. Let's go with mollusks:\n Here's the diagram of the eye of the limpet (a relatively unevolved mollusk):\n http://www.bradford.ac.uk/acad/lifesci/optometry/resources/modules/stage1/pvp1/images/Patella.GIF\n \n Notice that this one is almost where the python is with infrared receptors. Simple light-sensitive cells in a depression. It can detect light, and to some degree, detect the location of the source.\n \n The next one is this, from the primitive cephalopod, Natuilus:\n http://www.bradford.ac.uk/acad/lifesci/optometry/resources/modules/stage1/pvp1/images/Nautilus.GIF\n \n Notice that it's pretty much like the limpet \"eye\", except that the depression has deepened, and the tissue has grown over the depression to make a primitive \"iris\" and \"pupil\". Much more useful, and capable of forming a crude image by diffraction, much as a pinhole camera works. A lens is nice, but unnecessary.\n \n The next is from a snail:\n \n http://www.bradford.ac.uk/acad/lifesci/optometry/resources/modules/stage1/pvp1/images/Helix.GIF\n \n Not much different, except the cuticle has grown over the opening to provide a transparent protection for the pinhole, preventing it from being damaged or clogged.\n \n And here's a squid:\n http://www.bradford.ac.uk/acad/lifesci/optometry/resources/modules/stage1/pvp1/images/Squid.GIF\n Not much different, except the cuticle and epithelium have thickened over the pinhole to form lenses.\n \n By very small incremental changes, we see that a complex eye can form.\n \n (suggests evolution can be modeled by a motley assemblage of wheeled vehicles)\n \n Sorry. You need to show some independent evidence from several sources, showing that it's right. Try to find a better example.\n \n \nExactly, we know that the simpler form came after the more complex. Simply arranging them from less complex to more complex; as you do with eyes does not mean evolution.\n\n \n As you learned, there needs to be supporting evidence from other sources of information. Then we can be sure.\n \n \nYou can go across the thousands of animal species, re-arrange them by eye, regardless of any other taxonomical irregularities, and establish a pattern.\n\n \n I couldn't. No matter how I did it, if I don't follow the actually phylogenetic sequence, the evidence is all wrong. If you can do that, and keep it consistent, I'd sure like to see it.\n \n \nI could do the same based on the colour of an animal - by how green it is to show a logical progression from a light green animal to a dark green animal and suggest that they evolved from a lighter to a darker shade.\n\n \n Not good enough. Although it is sometimes possible to show a phylogeny by the evolution of pigments. Not a very reliable way to go, though.\n \n Would you like to see another example of transitionals in the evolution of eyes?",
