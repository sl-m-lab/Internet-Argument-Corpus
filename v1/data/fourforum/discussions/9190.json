If this were a simple stand up fight it would be no contest. The problem is that this isn't a simple us vs. them situation. It's them vs. them vs. them, with us in the middle trying to tell them what to do. I doubt that most serious thinkers will believe we were forced out militarily. The failure here was in diplomacy and planning, not military.\n \n As for your concerns about America being perceived as a paper tiger, I don't think we need to worry. Granted, we can't occupy a middle eastern country, but when it comes to just blowing stuff up we're still the pros. As long as were not threatening to move into a country and take over its government I think we'll still be taken seriously.",

If anyone has any thoughts, I'd love to hear them.\n\n \n You've covered all the scenarios. This issue is, unless economic matters bury it, going to be the primary campaign issue for 2008. Bush is still attempting to salvage some semblance of being correct in his Iraq blunder for historical purposes, but I don't think the public or the new congressional majority is going to let him stall for two years and make it solely a Democratic Party problem as was his original intent. \n \n I say, as I've always said, write a check and get out. We've already alienated most of the world with our Iraq policy, proved we can't properly occupy even a small nation like Iraq without unpopular conscription to provide adequate troop levels and we look like fools with this stay the course tripe. Let the chips fall where they may and start concentrating on cleaning up domestic matters. Israel as our ME gunslinger will provide enough ME problems for us and they're cheap compared to a $10-billion a month US occupation and continued US deaths. \n \n The immediate problem in leaving Iraq for whatever reason(s) for both Democrats and current administration is going to be economics. Pull Iraq and the flow-through out and we have a negative GDP plus a lot of unemployed reserves and national guard. But that may not matter if 2nd quarter numbers head south.",
