But such blasts rarely travel so far without dangerous levels of coal dust in the air, said Tony Oppegard, a former top official with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration and a former prosecutor of mine-safety violations in Kentucky. \n \n That view was echoed by Bruce Dial, a former federal mine safety inspector. \"You just don't see explosions like this without coal dust being a major factor,\" Mr. Dial said.\n \n Mine operators are supposed to use crushed limestone, known as rock dust, to limit coal dust levels. \n \n Federal regulators had cited Kentucky Darby LLC, the operator of the mine, three times this month, and at least 38 other times since 2001, for not cleaning up coal dust and other combustible materials, according to federal records. While federal investigators continued to study the cause of the explosion at the mine, relatives of the miners voiced frustration over a report that the miners' air packs had not worked.\n \n Although federal mine safety officials insisted that the air packs had worked properly, relatives of one of the surviving miners said he had told them that he had had only five minutes' worth of clean air, rather than the hour's worth required by federal regulations.\n \n \"There would probably be three men still alive if their air equipment had worked like they should,\" said Priscilla Petra, the wife of George William Petra, 49, who was among the three miners who died of carbon monoxide poisoning. \n \n Though two miners died from the explosion that rocked the mine, three miners died from toxic fumes, said the Harlan County coroner, Philip Bianchi.\n \n Jeff Ledford told local reporters on Sunday that his brother, Paul Ledford, the sole survivor of the explosion, had complained that his emergency equipment had provided air for only five minutes.\n \n \"If they had the right breathing equipment, I know at least three of them might have come out,\" Jeff Ledford told The Associated Press on Monday.\n \n Repeated telephone calls to the mine operator on Monday went unanswered. Randal McCloy Jr., the only survivor of the Sago Mine disaster in West Virginia in January, in which 12 miners died, has said that at least four of the air packs used by those miners failed, forcing them to share. The Kentucky miners were using the same model of so-called self-contained self-rescuers that the Sago miners had used, state officials said.\n \n But federal regulators denied that the air packs had failed in Kentucky.\n \n \"The survivor of the Darby No. 1 mine explosion informed M.S.H.A. investigators that his S.C.S.R. functioned properly and that he used it throughout his escape from the mine,\" said David G. Dye, acting administrator of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. \"Rescue workers who encountered the survivor during his escape independently corroborated that the survivor was using his S.C.S.R. when they encountered him.\"",

Rescuers reported that the seals did not withstand the blast on Saturday at the Kentucky Darby Mine No. 1.\n \n The foam blocks seal out methane and other gases that occur naturally in previously mined areas, and they are often used instead of conventional concrete blocks. Now state and federal officials are trying to determine whether the foam seals work as well as concrete.\n \n \"That's the question: Are these things leakier than concrete blocks?\" Chuck Wolfe, spokesman for the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet, said Tuesday. \n \n The blocks are stacked and put together with a sealant to form a wall that fills an opening, Mr. Wolfe said. Concrete blocks are stacked in the same way, but a different sealant is applied.\n \n Current mine safety regulations require seals to be able to withstand 20 pounds of pressure per square inch, whether built of concrete blocks or the lighter blocks. \n \n Mine operators prefer the foam seals because they are cheaper and lighter than concrete, Mr. Wolfe said. Typically, masons build walls of 53-pound concrete blocks to block out areas with bad air.\n \n But Tony Oppegard, the former general counsel for the Kentucky Department of Mines and Minerals who now represents coal miners, said the alternative seals endangered miners. He said he and others did not believe the alternative seals \"can withstand the pressure of an explosion as the concrete ones do.\" \n \n The alternative blocks failed in both the Darby mine and the Sago Mine in West Virginia, where an explosion in early January killed 12, and now officials are asking whether federal regulators should raise the threshold for alternative seals.\n \n Most coal operators still use concrete, said Chris Hamilton, the head of the West Virginia Coal Association and a member of a mine safety task force formed after the Sago disaster.\n \n Late Monday, the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said it would require concrete seals while the issue is being reviewed.\n \n Gov. Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky, who visited the area Tuesday, said thousands of such seals may be in use.\n \n Federal and state investigators entered the Darby mine Tuesday. Concerns about flammable methane and poisonous carbon monoxide gases had kept them out until its ventilation system could be repaired and the gases were brought to safe levels.\n \n Kentucky Darby officials have declined to comment since the explosion Saturday. A call to the mine office was not answered Tuesday.\n \n Three of those killed - Paris Thomas Jr., 35; Roy Middleton, 35; and George Petra, 49 - survived the blast but died of carbon monoxide poisoning, according to preliminary tests. Amon Brock, 51, and Jimmy D. Lee, 33, died of blunt force and heat injuries. The three who died of carbon monoxide poisoning were wearing their self-rescuer air packs when their bodies were found, the governor said. Whether the air packs were working properly remains part of the investigation, Governor Fletcher said.",

(AP) -- The lone survivor of the deadliest mine explosion in Kentucky since 1989, who managed to crawl toward the mine entrance where rescuers found him in a daze, bowed his head and wept quietly at funeral services for his fellow miners.\n \n Paul Ledford attended funerals Wednesday for Jimmy D. Lee, 33, Paris Thomas Jr., 35, and George Petra, 49. On Thursday, he was expected to attend services for Amon Brock, 51, and Roy Middleton, 35.\n \n ''Paul, he loved you and I love you, and I'm glad you were spared,'' Melissa Lee, Lee's widow, said at her husband's funeral.\n \n The miners died early Saturday at the Kentucky Darby Mine No. 1 in Harlan County. Lee and Brock died from the blast itself, while the other three died of carbon monoxide poisoning, according to preliminary tests. Ledford was rescued after he managed to crawl toward the mine entrance.\n \n Middleton died after he turned back to try to help Thomas and Petra, Ledford told federal Mine Safety and Health Administration investigators, according to a report Wednesday in The Courier-Journal of Louisville. The newspaper obtained details of the survivor's account from unnamed people close to the investigation.\n \n A federal agency said Wednesday that the Darby No. 1 mine was given 11 citations in a three-day span just days before the blast. Some of the citations were deemed reasonably likely to lead to injury.\n \n Gov. Ernie Fletcher ordered that a state flag fly at half-staff over the state Capitol in Frankfort during the hour of each miner's funeral. Each flag will be sent to the dead miners' families.\n \n At Lee's funeral, his widow recounted meeting him in 1997 when he entered the hospital where she worked, looking for a doctor. ''When he left that morning, I told my mother I met the man I wanted to marry.''\n \n At Petra's funeral at Kenvir Church of God Mountain Assembly, the Rev. Jerry Reynolds asked the standing-room-only crowd to pray for the safety of all miners.\n \n ''My hat's off to every coal miner here today,'' he said. ''God bless you.''\n \n The Rev. Franklin Stewart read a poem the miner had written recently titled ''Almost Anything Will Do'' about his Christian faith. Stewart said he knew he should be happy that Petra had a strong faith and believed in heaven but added, ''I'm just killed.''\n \n The Rev. Sonny Dean, who spoke at Thomas' funeral at an Evarts chapel, said the miner was his longtime friend.\n \n ''The strangers in the world who didn't know this friend, they missed a lot because this is a good man,'' Dean said.\n \n Lingering methane and carbon monoxide gases in the Harlan County mine has slowed the investigation into the blast, said Mark York, spokesman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Environmental and Public Protection.\n \n The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration released records to The Associated Press on Wednesday revealing the 11 citations issued May 15 to 17 against the mine. Among them were a handful considered ''significant and substantial,'' meaning they were reasonably likely to lead to injury.\n \n Ledford told federal Mine Safety and Health Administration investigators that he was with three of the miners when they heard and felt the explosion, according to a report Wednesday in The Courier-Journal of Louisville, which obtained details of the survivor's account.\n \n Citing sources close to the investigation, the newspaper reported that Ledford said two other miners, Lee and Brock, were using acetylene torches to cut metal in another part of the mine.\n \n According to the newspaper's report, Ledford told investigators that he and the three other miners boarded vehicles but encountered smoke. They put on self-contained breathing devices and continued on foot. Two of the miners fell behind when they all had to walk, and Middleton went back for them while Ledford continued ahead and was eventually found by rescuers, the report said.",

Mandates for such obvious necessities as extra oxygen supplies for trapped miners languished after an initial burst of concern over the disaster in January that killed 12 miners in Sago, W.Va. But the explosion last weekend in Kentucky that killed five miners has been followed by quick Senate approval of a bill ordering extra oxygen, more responsive rescue teams, and stronger underground barriers to seal off danger zones from workers.\n \n The Republican leaders in the House, lagging behind the Senate, hurried to catch up. But the sad truth is that safety equipment and rescue procedures have been scandalously neglected for years under company-friendly regulations that have been laxly enforced by government agencies stocked with political appointees who have come from the coal industry.\n \n The Senate bill does at least force companies to invest in new emergency communication and tracking equipment and to face tougher penalties and possibly a shutdown, rare now as companies let fines pile up. It also mandates the doubling of a miner's emergency oxygen packet to two hours, plus the stashing of extra oxygen along escape routes. In the two headlined disasters, some miners survived explosions only to die for lack of oxygen. \n \n Other changes - aimed at the 11-hour delay in starting a rescue attempt in Sago - would require rescue teams to be nearer to each mine for faster response, and to be protected from damage liability. Some companies have actually hesitated to have mine rescue teams for fear of being sued. The Senate bill only begins to repair the problem. But it is preferable to pro-industry proposals in the House to require drug testing for miners - as if the victims, not government and industry, were to blame for miners' highest death rate in 20 years.",

The fine should have been levied on the guilty parties, not the network. Maybe that would discourage future attempts at publicity by egocentric entertainers.\n \n The monetary value of fines levied on mines for safety violations are immaterial. They are the end result of safety violations within the work environment that need to be corrected. If the violations aren't corrected within the designated time frame, the mine should be closed until they are reinspected and confirmed safe again. Don't get hung up on the dollar amount, it's not meant to put a value on human life. You could make the same arguement for a person cited with a $60.00 speeding ticket; technically he is endangering the lives of every other driver on the road by breaking the law and driving to fast. Our system allows for human error, and gives the opportunity for correcting mistakes. If you'd rather see industry run by government, and honestly feel they'd do a better job at looking out for your safety, you might take a look at some of the Communist countries, and how they value the worker.",

   "http://select.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/opinion/11Mason.html\n \n June 11, 2006\n Op-Ed Contributor\n Bluegrass Blues \n By BOBBIE ANN MASON\n Lexington, Ky.\n \n WITH Barbaro's injury and five coal-mining deaths all on the same day, this spring has been a time for soul-searching in Kentucky. Oddly, horse racing and coal mining are linked in a deadly circle. And the turf on this track is the bluegrass itself.\n \n It's the unique, lush, limestone-laced bluegrass that makes thoroughbred bones strong. But Kentucky-born Barbaro's fragile bones may be an omen.\n \n The horse industry is said to be worth $4 billion to the state, with 100,000 jobs - not to mention the horse-drawn $1 billion tourist industry in the Bluegrass region. Yet the horse people say they can't survive without casino gambling to fatten racing purses. In order to keep Kentucky's reputation as a horse mecca, they want people to bet their money at racetrack casinos here instead of riverboat casinos out of state. The latest effort to get casinos approved failed this year in the Legislature, but the idea is still being debated. A blight on the Bluegrass, with Las Vegas overtones, might help the industry, but it wouldn't be the same. XXXX-shooters would have no eye for the horses and the landscape that produced them.\n \n The bluegrass is already disappearing in other ways. When you fly into Lexington, you are greeted by the picturesque Keeneland racetrack and Calumet Farm. But the airport has already envisioned the future. Passing drivers glimpse a mural of horses grazing and some shiny horse statues in a grassy nook. In the era of virtual reality, authenticity must seem creepy to developers, who are hot to fill the green fields around Lexington with grand illusions of country life - each with its patch of grass and barbecue grill and double garage. Some of the subdivisions are zoned for five acres per house, so they won't look so tacky.\n \n Lexington, a small city, is adding more than 1,700 houses a year.\n \n McMansions are spreading with oil-spill deliberation all over the nation, of course, but here we have a special reason for alarm. Last year the World Monuments Fund named our Bluegrass landscape one of the world's 100 most endangered places. \n \n Instead of farmland, we're seeing clusters of neo-trad pseudo-French country estates with hollow dunce-cap gables. Hamburg Farm turned horse pasture into a mega-stuff complex at the intersection of Man o' War Boulevard and Sir Barton Way, roads named for legendary racehorses. Hamburg, which moved its horse cemetery to make way for Wal-Mart, produced six Derby winners. Now you see the Dress Barn, Sprint, Old Navy.\n \n The energy to run all these developments - and a good percentage of all those in America - comes out of the mountains southeast of Lexington. The underground coal miners are being overworked and their safety compromised because of the nationwide hunger for cheap electricity. Most people don't realize that coal powers their world, since there's no coal in the basement. It costs two kilowatt hours of electricity to dry a load of clothes. That's about two pounds of coal. The classy new subdivisions tend not to allow clotheslines, of course, so the demand for energy seems urgent.\n \n The other day I went to see where some of the coal is strip-mined. With explosives, it's cheaper and faster than tediously tunneling. It is a sorrowful picture, one I can't quite grasp. Slaughterhouse, volcano, roadside bomb - these words come to mind, but they're not exact images of the mutilation. The mountains are murdered and the water killed. It's dangerous work, and the blasting and pollution threaten nearby residents and their homes. The wash on their clotheslines is sulfurous and dusty.\n \n Our voices aren't heard, they told me at a gathering in Hindman, about 120 miles southeast of Lexington. We're treated like throwaway people.\n \n I'm sick, and my land is sick, one young man said. \n \n And they all agreed this would never happen in the Adirondacks. \n \n Bobbie Ann Mason is a writer in residence at the University of Kentucky and the author of the forthcoming \"Nancy Culpepper,\" a collection of stories.",
