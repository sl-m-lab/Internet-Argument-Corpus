   "Originally Posted by IM2L844\n I'm not assuming anything. In the arguements from homology Darwinists choose only examples that support what they assume to be evolutionary relationships while ignoring examples that do not support the TOE. This fact is well recognized. It is the very reason that the idea of convergent evolution was invented. \n \n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n This is the old saw that homology involves a circular argument, which is usually stated as so: \" Common descent implies smilar structures and similar structures imply common descent\". The tacit assumption here is that similarity in structure is the only line of evidence for common descent. It is not. The evidence for common descent occurs prior to that for homolgy and can stand on its own.\n \n Common descent is evidenced by examples of preadaptation & exaptation in the fossil record, along with biogeography and embryology as well as genetics. Homologous traits must also appear in nested groupings, rather than at random. Taxonomists use terms like monophyletic & paraphyletic to describe these nested groupings, and to distinguish them from the polyphyletic pattern seen with non-homologous similarity in structure.\n \n OK!... Enough with the big words. Here's how it all pans out in practice. Let's put this all together to show how the wings of birds & bats are homologous as forelimbs, but only analogous as wings. It isn't hard to see that nearly all land-dwelling vertebrates have four limbs, two notable exceptions being snakes & whales which still have vestigial hindlimbs (whales having evolved from land dwelling mammals in the first place). A nested hierarchy of traits makes the common descent of forelimbs in bats & birds obvious: vetebrae, notochord, amnion, radial indeterminate cleavage in the embryo etc... along with fossil evidence for common ancestry with reptiles.\n \n But as for wings, there is no homology between birds & bats. Beside fossil evidence for independent origins for these wings, and obviously different structures to the wings (involving 4 fingers for bats and no fingers for birds), there is the lack of evidence for nested grouping here. Bats are obviously more closely related to other mammals than they are to birds, so the possibility of common ancestry is ruled out. Wings are therefore a polyphyletic trait with respect to birds & bats.\n \n You can also use this reasoning to show how analogous structures shared by placental ant-eaters & their marsupial counterparts in Australia show no signs of homology, because common ancestry is ruled out. That is , the placental ant-eaters have much more in common with other placentals than they do with the marsupial ant-eater. This is also confirmed by biogeography, since marsupials are almost exclusively, save for the oppossum, limmited to Australia. A close look at the anatomy of the skull will also show that similar structures for eating ants were derived independently. So, let me reinterate... COMMON ANCESTRY IMPLIES HOMOLOGY, and NOT the other way around.",

I remember that Jonathon Wells made a big point about different cleavage patterns in vertebrate embryos in his book: \"Icons of Evolution\", which can be explained by differences in yolk distribution and presence or absence of the amnion. Therefore, I'll amend that and say that all vertebrates are deuterostomes and enterocoelomates (refering to the embryonic development of the mouth and coelom, or body cavity). This would distinguish them from another big clade of animals which are protostomes & schizocoelomates (including annelids, arthropods & mollusks). So I'll use that instead of cleavage patterns in the future to illustrate common ancestry in embryology (not that most creationists will know what we're talking about anyway). Would you consider that to be more accurate?",

Would you consider that to be more accurate?\n\n \n Sure. \n \n And if you are dealing specifically with bats (a mammal) and birds, there are a slew of shared embryonic/developmental aspects that group them (not that you intended your list to be complete: just expanding on the idea). A few are the formation of three germ layers (they're both triploblasts, having ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm); formation of a primitive streak and an organizer called the Node (Henson's Node); ingression of cells through the node as it regresses posteriorly along the primitive streak; formation of a neural plate, neural folds, neural groove, and a notochord (which you already mentioned); presence of paraxial, intermediate, and lateral plate mesoderm; division of blocks of paraxial mesoderm into somites; migratory NEURAL CREST CELLS (a characteristic of vertebrates); formation of pharyngeal pouches (\"gill slits\"); formation of a forelimb bud and a hindlimb bud, with each having an AER (apical ectodermal ridge) at its tip with a proliferating region of mesenchyme just underneath called the PZ (progress zone) with outgrowth of the developing limb requiring ongoing reciprocal inductions between the AER and the PZ; formation of a linear heart tube by the convergence of two regions of splanchnic mesoderm on different sides of the body fusing; presence of four key extraembryonic membranes that form sacs (yolk sac, amnion, allantois, and chorion); and so on and so on. \n \n I've probably rambled off topic my now. But that birds and mammals are evolutionarily related can easily be seen by the similarities in embryonic development they share. And of course, there are the homologous structures in the adult forms too, which I think was the original point :-)",

It's been about 35 years since I've had a course in embryology, but a lot of what you wrote is still familiar to me, and it's amazing how overwhelming the evidence is. The essential thing (in case our creationist antagonists are evesdropping) is that all of these shared traits between birds & mammals are also shared by reptiles. AND, many things that birds & mammals DO NOT share with eachother will not be found in their common reptilian ancestors either. It's incredible how solid the evidence is for common ancestry, yet it is so easy for creationist websites to dismiss all this with a few pages of cleverly written phrases & twistifications. I would love to challenge any creationist, who thinks that the evidence for common descent is arbitrary, to devise an ad hoc classification scheme for living organisms, choosing any criteria they want. They can put octopi with arachnids for all I care (because they share 8 limbs). They can classify a whale as a warm blooded lungfish. It would be hilarious to see them come up with something that totally ignores the evidence for common descent and nested groupings. It would certainly be bizarre, whatever they came up with.",
