   "I will begin by posting a link to South Carolina's Declaration of Succession.\n \n http://www.pressipice.com/scdeclara.htm\n \n *Note All quotes that i post are from this declaration unless otherwise stated.\n \n Ok, After reading this is my opinion: Yes.\n \n Reasons why I think so, \n \n 1. \"...declared that the frequent violations of the Constitution of the United States, by the Federal Government, and its encroachments upon the reserved rights of the States, fully justified this State in then withdrawing from the Federal Union; but in deference to the opinions and wishes of the other slaveholding States, she forbore at that time to exercise this right. Since that time, these encroachments have continued to increase, and further forbearance ceases to be a virtue.\"\n \n As you can see according to South Carolina's convention, they believed the federal government violated the constution, but how? -< Later in reason 3. They say.\n \n 2. \"By this Constitution, certain duties were imposed upon the several States, and the exercise of certain of their powers was restrained, which necessarily implied their continued existence as sovereign States. But to remove all doubt, an amendment was added, which declared that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people. On the 23d May , 1788, South Carolina, by a Convention of her People, passed an Ordinance assenting to this Constitution, and afterwards altered her own Constitution, to conform herself to the obligations she had undertaken.\"\n \n In this excerpt South Carolina's convention says, that they have the rights guranteed by Amendment Ten, which states \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n \n The question is what rights did South Carolina believe that they had the right to? They never say in the declaration as far as can see. Anyone have an opinion on this?\n \n 3. \"In the present case, that fact is established with certainty. We assert that fourteen of the States have deliberately refused, for years past, to fulfill their constitutional obligations, and we refer to their own Statutes for the proof.\n \n The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: 'No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.'\n \n This stipulation was so material to the compact, that without it that compact would not have been made. The greater number of the contracting parties held slaves, and they had previously evinced their estimate of the value of such a stipulation by making it a condition in the Ordinance for the government of the territory ceded by Virginia, which now composes the States north of the Ohio River.\n \n The same article of the Constitution stipulates also for rendition by the several States of fugitives from justice from the other States.\"\n \n Their beliefs to what the governemnt ignored in the constution were Article IV Section 2 Clause 3 which has been removed now.\n \n 4. \"The guaranties of the Constitution will then no longer exist; the equal rights of the States will be lost. The slaveholding States will no longer have the power of self-government, or self-protection, and the Federal Government will have become their enemy.\"\n \n Which I believe is a direct provocation to armed conflict. And you may notice it says \"slave holding states\", which indicates more than one even its only South Carolina's declaration.\n \n There are my reasons and opinions, anyone else, all comments and opinions welcomed. Thanks. ;)",

   "The question is what rights did South Carolina believe that they had the right to? They never say in the declaration as far as can see.

   " My understanding of their reasons (and I'm not saying I agree with it) was that they had freely entered into a compact with the other states (at the end of the revolution), and as a freely joined member, could so freely leave.\n\n Thanks for clarify that part of the quote in point two. :)\n \n To make my point more rounded or fuller just not relying on South Carolina's Declaration of Succession. \n \n The United States Civil War which took place between 1861-1865 was caused by the attack on Fort Sumter. Factors that lead to the cause of Civil War were states rights, slavery, and succession. The events leading up to the Civil War were almost exclusively related to or were caused by slavery which was not addressed in the Constution except for Article IV Section 2 Clause 3 which creates a provision for the \"Service of Labour\". As Mr Madison put it in the the Debates in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Virginia, on the Adoption of the Federal Constution(Tuesday, June 24, 1787), \"I was struck with surprise when I heard him express himself alarmed with respect to the emancipation of slaves. Let me ask, if they should even attempt it, if it will not be a usurpation of power. There is no power to warrant it, in that paper. If there be, I know it not. But why should it be done? Says the honorable gentleman, for the general welfare: it will infuse strength into our system. Can any member of this committee suppose that it will increase our strength? Can any one believe that the American councils will come into a measure which will strip them of their property, and discourage and alienate the affections off five thirteenths of the Union? Why was nothing of this sort aimed at before? I believe such an idea never entered into any American breast, nor do I believe it ever will enter into the heads of those gentlemen who substitute unsupported suspicions for reasons.\" Amendment Ten in the Constution gurantees the states rights not granted to the federal government, therefore, the constution led to the Civl War because, it did not address a major factor of slavery in the cause of Civil War, it provided South Carolina with a reason to secede, it provided for tariffs to be enacted, provided for Lincoln's election, and constution was predicted to pronounce sothern and nothern differences and cause civil war predicated by the the Anti-Federilist Papers(http://www.constitution.org/afp/borden04.htm and http://www.constitution.org/afp/borden03.htm).",

   " The United States Civil War which took place between 1861-1865 was caused by the attack on Fort Sumter.\n\n \n Certainly that was the immediate cause, but...\n \n \nFactors that lead to the cause of Civil War were states rights, slavery, and succession. \n\n \n Yes slavery is an issue to but I believe the over-arching reason was the belief by South Carolina that it had the right to govern itself in a manner that suited itself - it was sovereignty. If that meant a slave economic system, then that was their business, and no one else's.\n \n The Federal government reacted because they saw it as a challenge to their power. It was a clash of which type of system would prevail; a Federation or a Confederation.\n whether;\n A Federation with a strong national government that could over-ride state's rights in the cause of the 'national' interest.\n or\n A Confederation in which the states are the stronger party, with the national government merely there to regulate relations between the states, so that no one state dominates over any other.\n \n South Carolina had left the British Empire of its own free will, and probably was not willing to see another 'empire' subvert its power. It had joined a coalition, because by itself, it would have been retaken by Britain quite easily.\n \n Interestingly enough William Godwin wrote in 1793 \"The whole constitution of... a country ought scarcely to exceed two articles; first, a scheme for the division of the whole into parts equal in their population, and secondly, the fixing of stated periods for the election of a national assembly: not to say that the later of these articles may very probably be dispensed with.\"1 When a nation considered many of it's populace to be unworthy of the name 'person', reason seems to have been dispensed with.\n \n Thomas Paine, in a letter to George Washington quotes a saying 'thirteen staves and ne'er a hoop will not make a barrel'.2 This meaning that without a centralising force, the 13 colonies would fall apart. What kind of 'hoop' was to be used? That is the question put to the test of arms in the US Civil War.\n \n Some people in the states of the North believed that the revolution was incomplete, because a number of men were still yearning to be free. They believed that the Federal government must act to over-rule the sovereignty of a state, in issues such as 'liberty' and 'justice' for all. South Carolina believed that state sovereignty over-ruled all other notions; such as personal liberty and justice. It is a far more autocratic ethos, evidenced by the aristocratic manners of white slavers.\n \n \n \n 1 \"Enquiry Concerning Political Justice\", Penguin Classics, p 609-610. The great liberal spirit of the time believed that man's reason alone would help provide for balance\n 2 \"The Thomas Paine Reader\" Penguin Classics, p492\n \n \n PS\n There's an interesting segue here to the divers debates on gun-control. Many an American believes that their personal rights outweigh those of the public good... that even if it meant less gun-related deaths over-all, the government still has no right to meddle.",

Is there a moment when a national interest out-weighed that of a state?\n \n If yes to either of these, then it could be put forward by the Union cause that the States had relinquished their rights of self-interest.\n \n Certainly it was the view of many union officers that their confederates counterparts were 'rebels'; for many had once served in the national army, had sworn to act for it against all enemies, internal and external... such as Robert E Lee who acted against the insurgent John Brown.",

It had joined a coalition, because by itself, it would have been retaken by Britain quite easily. ...The Federal government reacted because they saw it as a challenge to their power.\n \n \n So are you saying that the Civil War was inevitable, depending on if there was something holding the states together and it violated what they viewed to be their rights? or That it was caused just because of the federal government reacted and this wasn't caused by the U.S. constution because the south wasn't encroaching on the constution.\n \n A major factor if not the most major factor that led to the cause U.S. Civil War was slavery. The Constution did not provide any way for the U.S. and state governments to regulate slavery except for Article IV Section 2 Clause 3, therefore all the contoversies over slavery leading up to the Civil War were due to inadequancies in the Constution and lack of fore thought by the framers of the Constution. The lack of any mention whether slavery is legal or not in Constution led to farther tension between the North and the South before the Civil War. Issues leading to the Civil War over slavery were, the California Gold Rush which ripped slavery open again, Kansas Nebreska Act which led to Bleeding Kansas, Compromise of 1850, Ostend Manifesto, Dred Scott Decesion, and John Brown the Martyr, and the failed Crittenden Compromise. None of these issues would have occured over slavery except the John Brown incident(only if slavery was legal that is) if the Constution had spelled out what should be done about slavery. Slavery was a major issue, for instance, in the Alantic Monthly shortly after the secessionist movement began, James Russel Lowell wrote \",,,It would not be enough to please the Southern States that we should stop asking them to abolish slavery; what they demand of us is nothing less than that we should abolish the spirit of the age.\"",

   "I do not believe the civil war was the price the US had to pay for the constitution. The Civil war was the price the US paid for those in power failing to uphold the constitution. The genius of the constitution is that it can be changed to reflect current events and situations. This was put in the constitution for a reason. If the language of the constitution is ambigous, it is up to the court system to interpet the constitution. \n \n What you saw in the civil war is what happens when entities (and I am talking both sides) ignore the legal processes clearly outlined in the constitution.\n \n It has beencome popular to blame the south for the civil war (b/c the winner always gets to write history), but there were several acts commited by the federal government prior to the sucession of the states that were most likely in direct opposition to constitutional principals. The northerners knew this. The proper thing for them to do would have been to support a constitutional amendment. Instead, they used trickery and subterfuge to carry out their wishes. The south did not have to react in the manner which they did. There were legal alternatives they could have pursued.\n \n The founding fathers were implicit in their support of the right of the people to overthrow the government as a last resort. The southern state did not use this as a last resort.\n \n As afr as the whole slavery issue, that is an interesting question. At the start of the civil war, the North was not as \"anti-slavery\" as many would have us believe. I was a hotly debated topic at the time, but those who supported abolition of slavery nationwide were a minority. Even in the case of free states, the majority of the citizenry had no opinion on slavery in other states.",
