   "A Brief History of the Right to Self-Defense \n by Bob Heinritz \n \n 11/10/2009 \n For the first 150-years of the existence of the U.S.A., the right of citizens to carry arms was so fundamental it was not considered worthy of debate. The Founders considered their right to keep and bear arms the ultimate and most fundamental guarantee of life and free-dom against crime, foreign invasion, and as a last resort, a despotic government. No knowledgeable American--from the founding of the United States through the mid-1950's--would have questioned that the Second Amendment to the Constitution meant exactly what it says, \"... the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" This was not a right of a Militia. The \"Militia\" was--and under current law still is--all able-bodied adults, who are expected to keep their privately-owned arms similar to what is used by the military at the time.\n \n Nineteenth-century U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Joseph Story, called the American right to bear arms \"the palladium of the liberties of the republic.\" Our Founders believed that in a free society good citizens must always be prepared to defend themselves and their country. Thomas Jefferson said, \"The God who gave us life, gave us freedom to defend life.\" Being armed was more than a right. It was a moral obligation of citizenship. Twentieth-century history proves the wisdom of this philosophy:\n \n In 1911, Turkey established gun-control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5-million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n \n In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun-control. From 1929 to 1953, about 20-million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n \n In 1938, Germany established gun-control. From 1939 to 1945, a total of 13-million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n \n In 1935, China established gun-control. From 1948 to 1952, 20-million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n \n In 1956, Cambodia established gun-control. From 1975 to 1977, 1.5-million 'educated' people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n \n In 1964, Guatemala established gun-control. From 1964 to 1981, over 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated. \n \n In 1970, Uganda established gun-control. From 1971 to 1979 over 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n \n Australia: In the 21st Century, gun owners in Australia were forced to surrender 640,381 personal firearms --which were then destroyed by their own government. This program cost Australian taxpayers more than $500-million. Results the first year: \n \n 1. Australia-wide: Homicides up 3.2-percent. \n 2. Australia-wide: Assaults up 8.6-percent. \n 3. Australia-wide: Armed robberies up 44-percent - yes, 44-percent! \n 4. In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms went up 300-percent. One doesn't have to be a rocket-scientist to understand this. While the law-abiding citizens turned their guns in, the criminals did not. The illegal-gun trade thrives! \n 5. Australian criminal-data over the previous 25 years showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms. This has drastically changed upward, since criminals now are guaranteed their prey is unarmed. \n 6. There has also been a dramatic increase in home break-ins and assaults on the elderly. \n 7. Australian politicians are at a loss to explain how public safety has decreased, after such monumental efforts and expense were expended in successfully ridding Australian society--but not the criminals--of guns. \n 8. The Australian experience and the other historical facts leave no reasonable doubt. So called \"gun-control\" is harmful to freedom and public-safety.\n \n Great Britain: At the beginning of the 20th Century, Great Britain had few \"gun-control\" laws as we now know them. Although there were different class-restrictions, guns were freely available to nearly anyone. While the American militia originated from traditional British rights, the British Crown was aware that the very existence of a civilian-militia denied the monarchy a monopoly of force. Over the decades, Britain used various threats of revolution, Irish-separatism, and two world wars, as a pretext to enact ever-increasing restrictions and controls of guns in private hands. Currently, legal acquisition of a gun is nearly impossible for law-abiding British subjects. Despite this, the British government and British police have been unable to show these restrictions have reduced crime. Today, there are far more illegal guns in Britain, and far more violent crime. \"Hot burglaries\" -- that is burglaries in which the criminal knows the home-owners are home -- are eight times more likely in Britain than in the U.S.. Tourists and natives alike are five times more likely to be victims of a violent crime in London than in New York.\n \n United States: In all but two states of the U.S., law-abiding civilians who apply, submit to a police-check, and demonstrate reasonable firearms-proficiency and knowledge of the law, may receive a license to carry a concealed firearm. Contrary to threats by gun-control advocates, this has not resulted in \"blood in the streets\" or any increase of crime or gun-violence. In all U.S. jurisdictions where lawful concealed carry is possible, violence and violent crime has decreased significantly. Multiple criminological studies have demonstrated that in the U.S. each year over 2.5-million crimes are stopped or deterred by armed American civilians; most with no one being shot or harmed. On the other hand, in jurisdictions such as Washington, D.C., or Chicago, Illinois, where handguns are banned and long-guns must be disassembled and/or locked up, the homicide rate skyrocketed to eight times the national average. \n \n Worldwide: The concept that free people have the right to defend themselves is as old as civilization. Under ancient Greek, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon law, the ceremony of freeing a slave included placing a weapon in his hands \"as a symbol of his new rank.\" Aristotle wrote in Politics 68 that \"true citizenship included the right to possess arms, and that armed tyrants disarmed the oppressed.\" So what results from our \"more advanced\" thinking of the 20th Century? Conservatively, in excess of 100-million defenseless unarmed-civilians were rounded up and exterminated by various governments. (See data.)\n \n You won't see this data on the American evening news or hear our President, governors or other politicians disseminating this information. Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property. Guns in the hands of honest citizens preserve freedom and dignity -- from both criminal and government predators.

The next time a politician talks in favor of gun-control, please remind all who are listening of the lesson of history. All credible scholarship indicates so-called \"gun-control\" laws never work, are dangerous to the rights of the law-abiding, and are inconsistent with the values on which the United States were founded. The Founders of America had it right. With guns, we are \"citizens.\" Without them, we are \"subjects.\" Please spread this civil-rights message -- the right to life -- to all of your friends, and especially all your government servants.

Five times more likely to be victims of violent crime than in New York? Are you talking about less serious types of violent crime? Very questionable. Gun activists usually claim that New York is less safe because of gun control there but here a gun activist seems to be making the opposite claim. \n \n \n\n United States: In all but two states of the U.S., law-abiding civilians who apply, submit to a police-check, and demonstrate reasonable firearms-proficiency and knowledge of the law, may receive a license to carry a concealed firearm. Contrary to threats by gun-control advocates, this has not resulted in \"blood in the streets\" or any increase of crime or gun-violence.

A recent Harvard University report showed that if you use the same method to investigate the number of gun crimes then far more people report being a victim of a gun crime than using a gun in self defense:\n \n \"Most private surveys have used Approach 1. After controlling for other aspects of the surveys, these surveys indicate that criminal gun use is far more common that self-defense gun use. For example, in May 2000, a Washington Post national random-digit dial survey asked 'Not counting military service, have you ever been threatened with a gun or shot at?' Twenty-three percent (23%) said yes. In that same month (May 2000), a Gallup national random-digit dial survey asked 'Not including military combat, have you ever used a gun to defend yourself either by firing it or threatening to fire it?' Seven percent (7%) of respondents said yes. \n \n \"Some surveys have used Approach 1 to ask the same respondents about both self-defense and criminal gun use. Again, these surveys find that criminal gun use is far more common than self-defense gun use.4 5 6For example, data from the 2001 California Health Interview Surveys of 5,800 adolescents found that the typical California teen was 13 times more likely to be the victim of a gun threat than to have used a gun in self defense.7\"\n \n And a lot of the reported defensive gun uses are questionable:\n \"The opportunity for a law-abiding gun owner to use a gun in a socially desirable manner--against a criminal during the commission of a crime--will occur, for the average gun owner, perhaps once or never in a lifetime. It is a rare event. Other than self-defense, the use of a gun against another human is socially undesirable. Regular citizens with guns, who are sometimes tired, angry, drunk, or afraid, and who are not trained in dispute resolution, have lots of opportunities for inappropriate gun uses. People engage in innumerable annoying and somewhat hostile interactions with each other in the course of a lifetime. It should not be surprising that inappropriate, socially undesirable 'self-defense' gun uses by people who believe they are law-abiding citizens outnumber the appropriate and socially beneficial use of guns.6\"\n http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/hicrc/files/Bullet-ins_Spring_2009.pdf",

   "PS stop trying to pervert the constitution into saying what it doesn't to support your twisted, sick agenda.\n\n \n Fill the canteens, adjust your packs and tie your boots. The Congressional Brief for McDonald is in.\n \n David Kopel reports: \nJoined by 58 Senators (including 19 Democrats) and 251 U.S. Representatives (including 78 Democrats, although my count here may not be exact). Counsel of Record is former Solicitor General Paul D. Clement. Much of the brief recapitulates the lengthy historical record of congressional action (including but not limited to Reconstruction) to protect the individual right to arms from federal or state infringement.\n \n The brief also points out the incorporation of the Second Amendment is a particularly easy case, in that: 1. Express congressional intent to do so via passage of the 14th Amendment is overwhelming and clear, and 2. Unlike the First Amendment (which begins \"Congress shall...\"), the Second Amendment does not restrict itself to one level of government, so incorporation should be obvious, given that the First Amendment has already been incorporated.\n \n A third argument involves Congressional powers. First, state gun bans would interfere with Congressional war powers, since research shows that soldiers who have prior civilian familiarity with firearms can be trained faster and to a to a higher level of proficiency. (Sergeant York would be the most spectacular of the millions of examples to prove this point.)\n \n Moreover, Article I already forbids states from disarming the citizens. This is because Article I, section 8, clauses 15-16, give Congress authority over the militia, including the authority to call the militia into federal service. Because of the Supremacy Clause, states may not disable citizens from performing their federal militia duties. Accordingly, the Court accurately explained in Presser v. Illinois, \"the States cannot, even laying the [Second Amendment] out of view, prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms, so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security, and disable the people from performing their duty to the general government.\n",

   "The most important part of the brief is Part III, which begins: \"To enslave a class of people requires three basic things: destroy their self-sufficiency, prevent them from fighting back, and silence any opposition.\" The brief then goes on to argue that the the Court should resist suggestions that it hold that the Privileges or Immunities clause makes the first eight amendments applicable against the states, but does nothing else.\n \n Thus, for example, many states adopted lawsthat kept blacks from practicing trades or even leavingtheir employer's land without permission;17 othersadopted vagrancy laws that, in practice, made itillegal to be unemployed, and therefore illegal to look for work....And theanimating purpose of the Privileges or ImmunitiesClause, the elimination of constructive servitude,could not be achieved by enforcing only the narrowset of rights already enumerated in the existingConstitution.This last point is best illustrated by the sheervariety of laws invented by Southern governments toprevent freed slaves from enjoying the personalautonomy that was to have been theirs upon ratificationof the Thirteenth Amendment. To take just oneexample, starting with Virginia in 1870, Southernstates began to pass increasingly restrictive regulationsof \"emigrant agents\"-people who attemptedto recruit freedmen to leave their plantations bypromising higher wages and better working conditionson understaffed Western plantations, eventuallymaking it illegal or practically illegal for people toeven offer these economic opportunities to poor workers.23 Those and other laws had the express (thoughnot always expressed) purpose of binding formerslaves to the very same plantations they had workedduring slavery, and upon essentially the same terms.That was anathema to the people who wrote andThus, for example, many states adopted laws that kept blacks from practicing trades or even leaving their employer's land without permission; others adopted vagrancy laws that, in practice, made it illegal to be unemployed, and therefore illegal to look for work\n \n ....\n \n And the animating purpose of the Privileges or Immunities Clause, the elimination of constructive servitude, could not be achieved by enforcing only the narrow set of rights already enumerated in the existing Constitution. This last point is best illustrated by the sheer variety of laws invented by Southern governments to prevent freed slaves from enjoying the personal autonomy that was to have been theirs upon ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment.

Those and other laws had the express (though not always expressed) purpose of binding former slaves to the very same plantations they had worked during slavery, and upon essentially the same terms.\n \n In short, the protection of at least some economic rights (the right to choose where to work, the right to choose not to work, and the right to learn about work opportunities) was among the rights which the Privileges or Immunities clause was specifically intended to protect.\n \n IJ does not ask the Court in McDonald v. Chicago, to take any affirmative steps to protect those rights. The IJ simply urges that the McDonald Court enforce the Second Amendment via the Privileges or Immunities clause, and not create any dicta prematurely restricting the scope of P/I.\n\n \n Appears things are heating up on the Right to Keep and Bear Arms!",

From 1939 to 1945, a total of 13-million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. \n \n url]\n\n \n The rest of the story.........................\n \n \n A commonly heard argument against gun control is that the National Socialists of Germany (the Nazis) used it in their ascent to and maintenance of power. A corollary argument is sometimes made that had the Jews (and presumably the other targeted groups) been armed, they could have fought off Nazi tyranny. This tract seeks to counter these misassumptions about Nazi gun control. \n Gun control, the Law on Firearms and Ammunition, was introduced to Germany in 1928 under the Weimar regime (there was no Right to Arms in the Constitution of 1919) in large part to disarm the nascent private armies, e.g. the Nazi SA (aka \"the brownshirts\"). The Weimar government was attempting to bring some stability to German society and politics (a classic \"law and order\" position). Violent extremist movements (of both the Left and Right) were actively attacking the young, and very fragile, democratic state. A government that cannot maintain some degree of public order cannot sustain its legitimacy. Nor was the German citizenry well grounded in Constitutional, republican government (as was evidenced in their choices at the ballot box). Gun control was not initiated at the behest or on behalf of the Nazis - it was in fact designed to keep them, or others of the same ilk, from executing a revolution against the lawful government. In the strictest sense, the law succeeded - the Nazis did not stage an armed coup. \n \n The 1928 law was subsequently extended in 1938 under the Third Reich (this action being the principal point in support of the contention that the Nazis were advocates of gun control). However, the Nazis were firmly in control of Germany at the time the Weapons Law of 1938 was created. Further, this law was not passed by a legislative body, but was promulgated under the dictatorial power granted Hitler in 1933. Obviously, the Nazis did not need gun control to attain power as they already (in 1938) possessed supreme and unlimited power in Germany. The only feasible argument that gun control favored the Nazis would be that the 1928 law deprived private armies of a means to defeat them. The basic flaw with this argument is that the Nazis did not seize power by force of arms, but through their success at the ballot box (and the political cunning of Hitler himself). Secondary considerations that arise are that gun ownership was not that widespread to begin with, and, even imagining such ubiquity the German people, Jews in particular, were not predisposed to violent resistance to their government. \n \n The Third Reich did not need gun control (in 1938 or at any time thereafter) to maintain their power. The success of Nazi programs (restoring the economy, dispelling socio-political chaos) and the misappropriation of justice by the apparatus of terror (the Gestapo) assured the compliance of the German people. Arguing otherwise assumes a resistance to Nazi rule that did not exist. Further, supposing the existance of an armed resistance also requires the acceptance that the German people would have rallied to the rebellion. This argument requires a total suspension of disbelief given everything we know about 1930s Germany. Why then did the Nazis introduce this program? As with most of their actions (including the formation of the Third Reich itself), they desired to effect a facade of legalism around the exercise of naked power. It is unreasonable to treat this as a normal part of lawful governance, as the rule of law had been entirely demolished in the Third Reich. Any direct quotations, of which there are several, that pronounce some beneficence to the Weapons Law should be considered in the same manner as all other Nazi pronouncements - absolute lies.

The first two are felony charges.\n \n Police responding to a call on the 2700 block of Selkirk Avenue early Saturday morning were confronted by Schwartz in the lobby of the apartment building.\n \n According to the charges, he was covered with blood and told police someone had walked into his apartment while he had his gun in his hand.\n \n \"I am an American citizen and that's my right,\" he explained. \"If someone fights for my gun, that's what happens.\"\n \n He told officers the man they found lying face down on the kitchen floor was his best friend. He said he had tried to grab the gun, a .40-caliber Glock, from his hand and it went off.\n \n The victim was identified as Logan Daniel Ahlers, also of Burnsville.\n \n The medical examiner's office said Ahlers died as a result of blood loss from the bullet wound, which entered his neck and left near the top rear of his skull.\n \n Police located and received a statement from a mutual friend of both Schwartz and Ahlers, who said the three had met at a bar near Schwartz's apartment and gotten \"extremely smashed.\" They all made plans to meet back at Schwartz's apartment.\n \n The mutual friend told police that he and Schwartz arrived at the apartment. No sooner had Schwartz loaded a live round into the chamber of his pistol than Ahlers allegedly rushed into the apartment and wrestled with Schwartz, playfully.\n \n The gun went off and Ahlers collapsed in the kitchen, according to the criminal complaint.\n \n Schwartz told police Alhers never barged in, and that the three actually entered the apartment together. He said he was fully aware there was a live round in the gun the whole time and said he only may have waved it in the victim's general direction.\n \n He said he called the victim a name and that's when he lunged for the gun. Schwartz said he didn't pull the trigger.\n \n \"Guns and alcohol are a deadly combination as this tragedy clearly demonstrates,\" said Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom. \"Our deepest sympathy is extended to the family and friends of Logan Ahlers for their great loss.\"\n \n Schwartz appeared in court Tuesday.

Give me the same option and you will pry my gun out of my cold dead hands! Maybe you can understand that. \n \n As to the rest of your post.\n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review.

Whether or not they would be successful is another story.\n \n \n Should XXXXXX be allowed to have guns?\n \n Charges: Burnsville Shooting Followed Heavy Drinks\n BURNSVILLE, Minn. \n Michael Cody Schwartz, of Burnsville, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter, reckless discharge of a firearm, reckless handling of a gun and intentionally pointing a gun at another. \n Dakota County Jail \n A 25-year-old man has been charged in the shooting death of another 25-year-old man in Burnsville, Minn. over the weekend.\n \n Michael Cody Schwartz, of Burnsville, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter, reckless discharge of a firearm, reckless handling of a gun and intentionally pointing a gun at another. The first two are felony charges.\n \n Police responding to a call on the 2700 block of Selkirk Avenue early Saturday morning were confronted by Schwartz in the lobby of the apartment building.\n \n According to the charges, he was covered with blood and told police someone had walked into his apartment while he had his gun in his hand.\n \n \"I am an American citizen and that's my right,\" he explained. \"If someone fights for my gun, that's what happens.\"\n \n He told officers the man they found lying face down on the kitchen floor was his best friend. He said he had tried to grab the gun, a .40-caliber Glock, from his hand and it went off.\n \n The victim was identified as Logan Daniel Ahlers, also of Burnsville.\n \n The medical examiner's office said Ahlers died as a result of blood loss from the bullet wound, which entered his neck and left near the top rear of his skull.\n \n Police located and received a statement from a mutual friend of both Schwartz and Ahlers, who said the three had met at a bar near Schwartz's apartment and gotten \"extremely smashed.\" They all made plans to meet back at Schwartz's apartment.\n \n The mutual friend told police that he and Schwartz arrived at the apartment. No sooner had Schwartz loaded a live round into the chamber of his pistol than Ahlers allegedly rushed into the apartment and wrestled with Schwartz, playfully.\n \n The gun went off and Ahlers collapsed in the kitchen, according to the criminal complaint.\n \n Schwartz told police Alhers never barged in, and that the three actually entered the apartment together. He said he was fully aware there was a live round in the gun the whole time and said he only may have waved it in the victim's general direction.\n \n He said he called the victim a name and that's when he lunged for the gun. Schwartz said he didn't pull the trigger.\n \n \"Guns and alcohol are a deadly combination as this tragedy clearly demonstrates,\" said Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom. \"Our deepest sympathy is extended to the family and friends of Logan Ahlers for their great loss.\"\n \n Schwartz appeared in court Tuesday. His next appearance has been scheduled for Dec. 14 in Hastings.\n\n \n Is there a point to this or are you just posting to be posting?",

   "Revisionist bull****\n If that were true then the laws would have never been revised in the way they were.\n See the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.\n Such has never been the claim. The claim has always been that registration leads to confiscation. The gun laws in Germany ensured that no Nazis would be killed in the process of rounding up the jewish citizenry and shipping them off to concentration camps.\n\n This is mere speculation. Given that the Jews were not generally well armed nor willing to fight back, gun control probably made little difference.\n \n \n\n We actually can. We have more than enough armed individuals to dwarf the entire defense branch at a rate of more than ten to one. With all the troops being killed off in the middle east and the reserves at an all time low, the military would never have enough force to crush the American citizenry if the order came down.\n \n If you don't believe me, look at the middle east debacle. Insurgents and guerrillas are stale mating the finest fighting force there ever was. And they have a lower population number than we do.\n \n What's this got to do with anything?\n\n More speculation, but Americans probably would be in a much better position to defend against tyranny if you and your ilk hadn't been so eager to erase the militia portion of the Second Amendment. You know, there's a reason the Founders thought that a well regulated militia was necessary to the security of a free state as 19th Century Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story illustrates: \n \n \"And yet, though this truth would seem so clear, and the importance of a well regulated militia would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised, that among the American people there is a growing indifference to any system of militia discipline, and a strong disposition, from a sense of its burthens, to be rid of all regulations. How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by this clause of our national bill of rights.\"\n \n Indeed, the protection has been greatly undermined.",

I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right.

When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim.\" Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M.

   "95 Year Old WWII Battleship Sailor Tells OBAMA to \"Shape Up or Ship ...\n \n One of the better letters you will read today (maybe this year).\n \n \n Wow! Read this one. It is really good. And this gentleman says it just like it is. WW II Battleship sailor tells Obama to shape up or ship out !\n \n This venerable and much honored WW II vet is well known in Hawaii for his seventy-plus years of service to patriotic organizations and causes all over the country. A humble man without a political bone in his body,he has never spoken out before about a government official, until now. He dictated this letter to a friend, signed it and mailed it to the president.\n \n \n Dear President Obama, \n \n My name is Harold Estes, approaching 95 on December 13 of this year. People meeting me for the first time don't believe my age because I remain wrinkle free and pretty much mentally alert. \n \n I enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1934 and served proudly before, during and after WW II retiring as a Master Chief Bos'n Mate. Now I live in a \"rest home\" located on the western end of Pearl Harbor, allowing me to keep alive the memories of 23 years of service to my country.\n \n One of the benefits of my age, perhaps the only one, is to speak my mind, blunt and direct even to the head man.\n \n So here goes.\n \n I am amazed, angry and determined not to see my country die before I do, but you seem hell bent not to grant me that wish. \n \n I can't figure out what country you are the president of. \n \n You fly around the world telling our friends and enemies despicable lies like: \" We're no longer a Christian nation\" \" America is arrogant\" - (Your wife even announced to the world,\"America is mean- spirited. \" Please tell her to try preaching that nonsense to 23 generations of our war dead buried all over the globe who died for no other reason than to free a whole lot of strangers from tyranny and hopelessness.) \n \n I'd say shame on the both of you, but I don't think you like America, nor do I see an ounce of gratefulness in anything you do, for the obvious gifts this country has given you. To be without shame or gratefulness is a dangerous thing for a man sitting in the White House.\n \n \n After 9/11 you said,\" America hasn't lived up to her ideals.\" \n \n Which ones did you mean? Was it the notion of personal liberty that 11,000 farmers and shopkeepers died for to win independence from the British? Or maybe the ideal that no man should be a slave to another man, that 500,000 men died for in the Civil War? I hope you didn't mean the ideal 470,000 fathers, brothers, husbands, and a lot of fellas I knew personally died for in WWII, because we felt real strongly about not letting any nation push us around, because we stand for freedom. \n \n I don't think you mean the ideal that says equality is better than discrimination. You know the one that a whole lot of white people understood when they helped to get you elected.\n \n Take a little advice from a very old geezer, young man. \n \n Shape up and start acting like an American. If you don't, I'll do what I can to see you get shipped out of that fancy rental on Pennsylvania Avenue. You were elected to lead not to bow, apologize and kiss the hands of murderers and corrupt leaders who still treat their people like slaves. \n \n And just who do you think you are telling the American people not to jump to conclusions and condemn that Muslim major who killed 13 of his fellow soldiers and wounded dozens more. You mean you don't want us to do what you did when that white cop used force to subdue that black college professor in Massachusetts, who was putting up a fight? You don't mind offending the police calling them stupid but you don't want us to offend Muslim fanatics by calling them what they are, terrorists.\n \n \n One more thing. I realize you never served in the military and never had to defend your country with your life, but you're the Commander-in-Chief now, son. Do your job. When your battle-hardened field General asks you for 40,000 more troops to complete the mission, give them to him. But if you're not in this fight to win, then get out. The life of one American soldier is not worth the best political strategy you're thinking of.\n \n \n You could be our greatest president because you face the greatest challenge ever presented to any president. \n \n \n You're not going to restore American greatness by bringing back our bloated economy. That's not our greatest threat. Losing the heart and soul of who we are as Americans is our big fight now. And I sure as hell don't want to think my president is the enemy in this final battle.\n \n Sincerely,\n Harold B. Estes\n \n \n When a 95 year old hero of the \"the Greatest Generation\"stands up and speaks out like this, I think we owe it to him to send his words to as many Americans as we can",

Nobody ever said we'd have to do battle with tanks and jets to begin with. Our urban settings would make main battle vehicles impractical, we'd most likely be fighting soldiers on foot, and our weapons are more than adequate for that.\n \n Look at all the propaganda being put out by the gun control crowd. They claim the .50 BMG rifle can shoot down a plane, or crack tank armor and destroy troop transports in a single shot, and there are thousands of those in ownership. They claim the FN 5.7 pistol can penetrate body armor, and it's perfectly legal to own. And there are millions of ARs, AKs, Mini 14s and other various of urban defense carbine in private hands, and billions of rounds of ammunition.\n \n And we have a secret weapon. We're currently battling the drug cartels of Mexico. But if the government declares war on us, we can call them up and hire them as mercenaries to fight with us. Thousands, if not millions of violent murderers and professional soldiers.

People do not have the right to take up arms against those that come to arrest them. If they do they no longer have the right to life. It is our constitutional system.\n\n \n \n You change the subject and fail to answer questions. Your military structure got demolished and now you are about to get your ideal of law enforcement demolished.\n \n The hell the people don't have a right to resist an unlawful arrest! SCOTUS has ruled on this many time so it is not \"our constitutional system\". You harp on David Koresh like you would know anything about it other than the pablum spread by the MSM and your handlers. The ATF had a photo shoot ready for a presentation to congress for more funds. The charge against Koresh was child abuse. The feds have no title nor jurisdiction over such a charge. There is no such animal as \"due cause\". There is probable cause but then again there is no title nor jurisdiction by federal officers. You find the crimes the feds are bound to enforce in Article 1, section 8 and get back to me.\n \n Your continual grasping for straws is humiliating you! In the case of the Davidians, the SCOTUS had a chance to rule on the 'machine gun' charge and did so in the Castillo case that had the effect of knocking off 15 years of the sentence of survivors. All evidence must be found by a jury and not some \"due cause\" as you would like to pretend. Lon Hourouchi is still liable for a suit of murder in the Randy Weaver case but the State claims they didn't have the money to prosecute.\n \n People do have a right and duty to resist an unlawful arrest! You get out of your title and jurisdiction and you are liable. The judge that heard the Branch Davidian case wouldn't let the feds carry guns in his court, that is how little he thought of them and didn't trust them. How are them apples kiddo?",

   "Then why do we need arms to defend ourselves from them? That's your argument. You claim we need arms to defend ourselves and then in the next breath you say they would never turn on us.\n Have you ever heard of Nazi Germany?\n\n First of all I quoted Alexander Hamilton, not Tither, in Federalist 28. That was the sentiments of our Founders. \n \n It is not a question of what I say, or what I want, or anything. Those are just the facts. The Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land. \n \n Our Founders just got finished throwing off the chains of a tyrannical government, and had to fight the Most Powerful Army the World had ever known, in order to secure our Freedom! They distrusted government, even the very government they were in the process of making. You can see that all through our Founding documents. \n \n Although the thought of a government going rogue seems remote to us, no one should think it can't happen. Certainly our Founding Fathers did not think it couldn't. The 2nd Amendment is in the Constitution for that very reason. \n \n Let us remember that We the People are the Only owners of this country. That is the way our Founders designed it, and with Inalienable Rights! We delegate powers to the Government, but they are only supposed to have only those powers we delegated in the Constitution. Nothing more.\n   \n The Declaration of Independence \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\n\n \n The Government is supposed to answer to us. It is NEVER to be the other way around! \n \n Some examples on our Founding principles. The first one is found at our National Archives.  The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n Alexander Hamilton 1775\n \n The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment,. or musty records. They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself,  and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. (Try to get your head around that for a moment!)\n \n ..... The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights.\n\n  Alexander Hamilton on the Bill of Rights and our Unalienable Rights. Federalist Papers no. 84\n I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\"\n \n Much like some are trying to do now.\n \n   Preamble Bill of Rights \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution \n\n   9th Amendment \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n \n Rights Retained by the People Annotations X\n Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those.\n\n \n They are ALL our Rights.\n \n The constitution was written to limit the power of gov't and to ensure all rights to the people. Government does not possess 'rights' but 'enumerated powers' and only those enumerated. The theory that gov't possess 'rights' and then can curtail or ration those rights to the people as they deem necessary for their own security is ludicrous to say the least!\n",

   "[QUOTE=Dirty Harry;379854]The rest of the story.........................\n \n \n A commonly heard argument against gun control is that the National Socialists of Germany (the Nazis) used it in their ascent to and maintenance of power. A corollary argument is sometimes made that had the Jews (and presumably the other targeted groups) been armed, they could have fought off Nazi tyranny. This tract seeks to counter these misassumptions about Nazi gun control. \n Gun control, the Law on Firearms and Ammunition, was introduced to Germany in 1928 under the Weimar regime (there was no Right to Arms in the Constitution of 1919) in large part to disarm the nascent private armies, e.g. the Nazi SA (aka \"the brownshirts\"). The Weimar government was attempting to bring some stability to German society and politics (a classic \"law and order\" position). Violent extremist movements (of both the Left and Right) were actively attacking the young, and very fragile, democratic state. A government that cannot maintain some degree of public order cannot sustain its legitimacy. Nor was the German citizenry well grounded in Constitutional, republican government (as was evidenced in their choices at the ballot box). Gun control was not initiated at the behest or on behalf of the Nazis - it was in fact designed to keep them, or others of the same ilk, from executing a revolution against the lawful government. In the strictest sense, the law succeeded - the Nazis did not stage an armed coup. \n \n The 1928 law was subsequently extended in 1938 under the Third Reich (this action being the principal point in support of the contention that the Nazis were advocates of gun control). However, the Nazis were firmly in control of Germany at the time the Weapons Law of 1938 was created. Further, this law was not passed by a legislative body, but was promulgated under the dictatorial power granted Hitler in 1933. Obviously, the Nazis did not need gun control to attain power as they already (in 1938) possessed supreme and unlimited power in Germany. The only feasible argument that gun control favored the Nazis would be that the 1928 law deprived private armies of a means to defeat them. The basic flaw with this argument is that the Nazis did not seize power by force of arms, but through their success at the ballot box (and the political cunning of Hitler himself). Secondary considerations that arise are that gun ownership was not that widespread to begin with, and, even imagining such ubiquity the German people, Jews in particular, were not predisposed to violent resistance to their government. \n \n The Third Reich did not need gun control (in 1938 or at any time thereafter) to maintain their power. The success of Nazi programs (restoring the economy, dispelling socio-political chaos) and the misappropriation of justice by the apparatus of terror (the Gestapo) assured the compliance of the German people. Arguing otherwise assumes a resistance to Nazi rule that did not exist. Further, supposing the existance of an armed resistance also requires the acceptance that the German people would have rallied to the rebellion. This argument requires a total suspension of disbelief given everything we know about 1930s Germany. Why then did the Nazis introduce this program? As with most of their actions (including the formation of the Third Reich itself), they desired to effect a facade of legalism around the exercise of naked power. It is unreasonable to treat this as a normal part of lawful governance, as the rule of law had been entirely demolished in the Third Reich. Any direct quotations, of which there are several, that pronounce some beneficence to the Weapons Law should be considered in the same manner as all other Nazi pronouncements - absolute lies. (See Bogus Gun Control Quotes and endnote [1].)\n \n \n]The Third Reich did not need gun control (in 1938 or at any time thereafter) to maintain their power.

He falsely accused her of committing a crime and told her she was lying. Now she's writing a book about the abuse she suffered. I've read part of the draft.\n\n \n \n You would need to see the search warrant and the affidavit used to obtain the search warrant to know if the documents and phones are related to the investigation. I have written many search warrants, and I have never yet written one for a residence that searches just for the illegal contraband (the drugs, the illegal guns, the stolen property, etc.). Social security cards, birth certificates, the cable bill, phone bills, tax documents, etc. are all frequent targets of residential search warrants. These documents are not illegal contraband per se but they can be evidence of a link to criminal activity. For example, if you are searching a drug house these documents can help show who stays there, rents the house, or pays the bills-which in turn can provide evidence of that person's possible link to the criminal activity at the house. A search for a specific cell phone is an indication that evidence exists to show the cell phone has been used to promote criminal activity (to set up drug deals, for example). Asking about any guns present is a common safety precaution. In addition to making sure no one looses their temper and tries to use one, there have been occasions where guns which have been hidden were accidentally fired by officers conducting a search. It is also possible the officers were attempting to elicit an incriminating statement if the presence of a gun at the house would have been unlawful (if certain drugs were already in the house, or if the person were a felon, for example). \n \n As far as tearing up the house goes, it is a matter of individual officer discretion. Search warrants authorizing a search for a particular item justify searching anywhere within the house that the item could possibly be hidden. I teach search warrant writing and I preach that the warrant should be written to include the smallest possible item your probable cause will support. Say, for example, you stumble across a filing cabinet in a house you are searching. If all you have listed to look for in the search warrant is the stolen 52in plasma TV then you cannot open the drawers and look inside (unless you are prepared to later explain to the judge how you thought it possible to find a TV inside the drawer) But if you are looking for drugs (or ammunition, shell casings, etc)-well they can be hidden anywhere-and a search warrant would authorize you to even open up the walls if the officers felt it necessary to do so.\n \n Regardless of what you are looking for, though, every item listed on a search warrant must be supported by probable cause to believe that the item you want to seize is not only evidence relevant to prove criminal activity but is also believed to be at the residence you are going to search. If the item is not listed in the search warrant, then officers who stumble onto it during a search for other items may not seize it unless it is \"immediately apparent\" that the item they have stumbled on is evidence of a crime (for example, you open a closet door looking for the stolen TV listed in the search warrant and instead find several marijuana plants and a grow light).",
