   "I'm on a resuscitation mission down here - where nobody has posted for a long time. Perhaps this basement forum is seldom visited because there's very little interest in \"world views\". Or it may be that people are (rightly) suspicious of soapbox opinions passed off as systematic thinking. Surely the \"confession\" of some canting nonentity is best left....well, obscure ? \n \n I would like to think that I had a settled world view which rested securely on the ground of rational consistency. I know that I have no such thing. In some moods, I find myself without an ideology of any description - with no fixed opinions about anything. (Like Robert Musil's \"man without qualities\"). More usually, I have a continuum of attitudes and beliefs that range from reactionary to libertarian. These views have no permanent home address. \n \n If I have a core belief it is that no completely unbiased outlook is possible. I agree with Orwell who said that all creeds and causes involve the same lies, follies, and barbarities.\n \n I guess my basic disposition is uncommonly cynical and this infects my world views as they come and go. Perhaps my ideal residence would be inside a barrel - living next door to Diogenes.",
