I'm sure there are some that have arranged marriages and the such, but let's put that aside for the moment. Legality is the proof that the love is real. Nothing more and nothing less for the majority of people. I agree, the ballot initiative is flawed in that it doesn't set some standards for some of the propositions like the 8 and those dealing with bonds and the such. If the majority had the say in everything, that would lead to mob rule, heck I'm sure if that were to stay true, blacks and whites couldn't marry and would probably still be segregated.

Which makes about as much sense as saying we have a right to vote, but the government gets to pick the single candidate on our ballot.\n \n \n \nThe simple fact is, a certificate from a state government is not love. It's not recognition of being a person.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n So close, but yet so far away...\n We've all heard the ANTI-GAY ARGUMENTS against gay marriage...\n How many times do you hear the argument that they don't want to \"accept\" gay marriage?\n How many times do you hear arguments about governmental RECOGNITION of gay marriage?\n \n \n \nNo one voted against gays loving one another.

The anti-gay marriage crowd loses its capability to say, with an authority \"you're not really married\".\n And THAT is what the anti-gay majority of the anti-gay marriage crowd ultimately wants.

   "That is true.\n Prejudice and bigotry do not have to do with love or \"the human heart\".\n But that IS ultimately what marriage is about, along with legal qualifiers since it's a legal recognition issue...\n\n \n Nope; prejudice is not the issue here either. People just believe marriage is defined as between a man and a woman. Nothing wrong with that; no one should have to change their view of marriage when groups come along wanting it changed. \n \n The point is that comments like \"love\" and \"the human heart\" are propagandistic. They are intended to illicit sympathy, pure and simple. But anyone wanting to redefine marriage could call it as about \"love\" and \"the human heart\". The point is, that's simply not the point.

It's not just something that's false. I think you're pretty unusual in having such a wide-open idea of what constitutes LYING.\n \n At any rate, what the LDS church was doing in saying they believed this would eventually lead to indoctrination and rights of churches being eroded was giving their opinion.

It's happened in places like Canada and the UK, where religious leaders can no longer speak out against homosexuality without fear of prosecution.

That's a \"belief\" that is at the heart of the early KKK.\n \n Whether you want to \"believe\" it or not, there are beliefs that come from blatant ignorance, prejudice, and stupidity.\n \n \n \nWhat makes you think THAT'S the only reason they believe that, Foundit?\n\n Can you give me another REAL reason?\n \n \n \nIt's happened in places like Canada and the UK, where religious leaders can no longer speak out against homosexuality without fear of prosecution.\n\n This ain't Canada.\n Or, using your standards, religious people execute gays in the Middle East.\n If I talked about Christians voting against gays out of a desire for execution, and stated that was my \"belief\", would you simply say \"That's foundit66's belief\" and perform no more critical analysis?\n Nah.

That's what you don't get.\n\n Yeah.\n The guy who keeps reminding you that SOCIETY can have its own ideals on marriage, and the GOVERNMENT can recognize rights in a different way, doesn't get that...\n emoticon_frazzled\n You repeatedly refuse to acknowledge and accurately relay what other people's ACTUAL positions are.\n \n \n \nNo, Loving didn't having anything to do with love. emoticon_xlove \n\n CLAFCLO.\n I never said it did.\n \n Since you AGAIN try to obfuscate the point, let me repeat it...\n You said: \"But people don't think that should include doing so with choices that pertain to standards outside what society thinks marriage IS, at least when it comes to very fundamental standards.\"\n I turn around and point out that if the SCOTUS judges had used \"what society thinks marriage IS\" as a standard in Loving v Virginia, they couldn't have overruled interracial marriage.\n \n You turn around and give that utterly meaningless reply.\n \n \n \nIn that case, let's give marriage benefits to single people.\n\n How many times are you going to throw out the same meaningless responses??\n NAME ME ANY marriage benefit which makes sense for a single person.\n Can a single person inherit their own items?

   "Sure; doesn't mean it is most of the time in this case.\n \n 'Course you're going to assume it's prejudice just because they hold to a position you disagree with, not because you've actually proven or truly determined it's prejudice.\n \n \n \n Only to someone who holds a guilty-till-proven innocent outlook on things. If you believe prejudice was what was behind it, then prove it. (we both know you can't.) \n\n \n Yeah, you can't prove prejudice in absolute terms. We can look at experience, add up the evidence. When people exclude for no rational reason, the reason is likely bigotry. I'm not talking about practices like no electricity for the Amish or dietary things. I mean identity as in homosexuality. Saying you can act straight, even if you're gay, doesn't cut it. \n \n At any rate, religion is your only reason for opposing gay marriage, jyoshu. The rest is just a smokesreen. Hey, I'm not going to your church, so you have no right to impose its doctrines on my life. telling me I can't marry because your church says so. Why doesn't it work the other way around? Why can't I come into your church's life, the lives of its members, and impose my values on them? Let's see. We'll start by having gays and all women in equal positions of power in the hierarchy to straight men. Then, we will only allow the marriages of atheists. What else could those who have the same belief system as me, do? Hmmm...this could be fun.\n \n \nIf that issue was was a behavior rather than skin color and religion had admonitions against that behavior, you might have something. But since it doesn't, that comparison makes no sense.\n\n \n Society can and has prevented African Americans from marrying. You could say all marriage is behaving as married. The African American couple was behaving as an African American couple. Gay people are behaving as a gay couple. One involves race, and the other involves sexual orienation. Both involve identity. \n \n \nAt any rate, what the LDS church was doing in saying they believed this would eventually lead to indoctrination and rights of churches being eroded was giving their opinion.\n\n \n It was a lie.\n \n \nFrankly, *I* TOO think that's the direction society will go, if things aren't curbed. Are you now saying you think I'm LYING by doing that? I have no intent to deceive anyone by saying that--it's just my opinion. Geez. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n But now you are talking about broarder societal processes, are you not? These would go on anyway. It's not specifically about the marriage law.\n \n \nWhat makes you think THAT'S the only reason they believe that, Foundit? It's happened in places like Canada and the UK, where religious leaders can no longer speak out against homosexuality without fear of prosecution. Seems to me things are headed that direction here too with the way this issue is becoming so PC.\n\n \n Don't believe everything you read on the right-wing American sites, jyoshu. Religious leaders may speak out against homosexuality(and here I thought you were just concerned about private sex acts). What they can't do is incite violence or genocide. Other goups besides gay people are protected under these laws. The laws were in existence long before legalized same sex marriage in Canada. \n \n Canada is also a very different country and society. The U.S. is more about individual rights(unless you are gay of course). In Canada, we generally strike a balance between group rights and individual rights. We also have restrictions on pornography, if it's deemed by a government board to be degrading. Such a thing doesn't exist in the U.S., or people would be crying \"censorship\"! The cops here can stop traffic, generally on certain times of the year when people are likely to be drinking. They will check to see if you have been drinking and driving. They don't need \"just cause\", to stop you, like in the U.S. \n \n \nWell, that is what a vote is. Society defining something via vote. In this case defining the institution.\n\n \n No, they are taking away rights by a vote.\n \n \nGo ask Brittany Spears. Love and human heart have never HAD to be relevant to marriage from the standpoint of the law OR society. BOTH goalposts apply simulaneously, Foundit, when it comes to the \"love\" thing. That's what you don't get.\n\n \n That's pretty cynical, don't you think? It sounds like you are admitting this is just about discrimination against a couple because they are same sex. After all, if it's not about love, it's about recognizing, supporting and promoting the straight couples, but deliberately leaving out the gays for no reason.\n \n \nNo, Loving didn't having anything to do with love. emoticon_xlove\n\n \n The courts have already determined that marriage is a right, and the right to marry means nothing if it doesn't involve to marry a partner of one's choice. Marrying of one's choice is all about love.\n \n \nIn that case, let's give marriage benefits to single people. Let's give 'em to polygamous couples. (shrug) After all, a man and two woman may truly LOVE each other, and it's all something in their \"human heart\". emoticon_rolleyes They're all cases of things society may not approve of doing, and all cases that could claim society has no legitimate state interest in restricting. Such is the case for basically throwing out the standards.\n\n \n Nonsense. I don't see the point of giving marriage benefits(for a couple) to a single person. Polygamy is against the law. That's not changing based on whether or not same sex couples can marry. It didn't change with the decriminalization of homosexuality, either, now did it?\n \n When and if society goes down that road, to possible, decriminalization or legalization of polygamy, the arguments will be different than ones against homophobic prejudice and sex discrimination. The arguments on polygamy which will determine whether or not there's a legitmate state interest to restrict rights, will be based on religious freedom. Surely, we need to curb religious freedoms to prevent this slippery slope. Let's take away the rights of Christians to marry. The gay rights issue has not one thing to do with polygamy, do you get that--nada! It will go on as it always has, completely independent of what happens with gay people and our place in society.\n \n Polygamy is not a sexual orientation. It's a type of religious behaviour. Polygamists may experience sexual love with one individual of different sex. They already have the right to marry someone of their choice as heterosexuals. Gay people only experience love with the same sex. Therefore, there are much more profound issues of choice when it comes to gay people. Restrictions on same sex marriage also involves gender discrimination when it comes to my choice of partner.",

Maybe they genuinely believe gay unions of ANY kind are the wrong approach for society and are taking that stance BECAUSE they think it's best for society to do so. It seems to me that the whole \"prejudice\" thing is pretty presumptuous to assume by default.\n \n \nOr, since it's a condition that seems to satisfy you so much when an anti-gay person does it (or doesn't even do it), maybe you would accept \"Because I believe...\" as an answer, and leave it at that?\n\n \n But you never accept that when it's given to YOU.

Saying you can act straight, even if you're gay, doesn't cut it. \n\n \n The 'identity' part isn't what the religious issue is about.\n \n \nAt any rate, religion is your only reason for opposing gay marriage, jyoshu. \n\n \n (shrug) It's the only reason needed. People are free to oppose for ANY reason they want. This isn't a gestapo state we live in where people can't oppose things they believe is wrong.\n \n \nHey, I'm not going to your church, so you have no right to impose its doctrines on my life.\n\n \n I'm not imposing any doctrines on your life. You don't have to adopt my doctrines at all.\n \n \nWhy doesn't it work the other way around? Why can't I come into your church's life, the lives of its members, and impose my values on them\n\n \n Well ... yeah. If you're a U.S. citizen, you are more than welcome to try and change society and laws toward what you think is right for society. That's what everyone does--try to change things toward their morality and values. You may not get far, but this is a free country and if you're a citizen you are indeed free to participate in its system. Pretty cool, really. emoticon_xagree\n \n \nSociety can and has prevented African Americans from marrying. \n\n \n It's interesting that you won't take any examples to compare to gay marriage when it doesn't fit what you want things to be (the polygamy comparison), but you will not hesitate to make other comparisons like these.\n \n \nFor someone who You could say all marriage is behaving as married. The African American couple was behaving as an African American couple. Gay people are behaving as a gay couple. One involves race, and the other involves sexual orienation. Both involve identity. \n\n \n Yeah but one does not legitimize a completely different sort of behavioral relationship, while the other does. An African American couple having an opposite-sex relationship is STILL an opposite-sex relationship.\n \n \nIt was a lie.\n\n \n No, that would involve an intent to deceive. Odds are the LDS church really did believe what they were saying.\n But now you are talking about broarder societal processes, are you not? These would go on anyway. It's not specifically about the marriage law.\n \n \nReligious leaders may speak out against homosexuality(and here I thought you were just concerned about private sex acts). What they can't do is incite violence or genocide. Other goups besides gay people are protected under these laws. The laws were in existence long before legalized same sex marriage in Canada. \n\n \n And is whether or not it incites violence a judgment call, or are there specific quantifiable standards they go by to determine that in terms of the speech? 'Cause \"inciting violence\" sounds like one of those things the government could throw out there as a value judgment to use as an excuse to supress speech. History has shown us governments aren't really so trustworthy.\n \n \nCanada is also a very different country and society. The U.S. is more about individual rights(unless you are gay of course). In Canada, we generally strike a balance between group rights and individual rights.\n\n \n Well that's what everyone does. It's just that the balance in some places varies depending on what's considered more important. Restricting free speech isn't so balanced at all, IMO.\n \n \nThe cops here can stop traffic, generally on certain times of the year when people are likely to be drinking. They will check to see if you have been drinking and driving. They don't need \"just cause\", to stop you, like in the U.S. \n\n \n Thanks for another reminder of why I don't live in Canada! No offense, but I don't think police should have that much power over people.\n \n \nNo, they are taking away rights by a vote.\n\n \n (Shrug) Sure; but it's still defining an institution. That doing so results in a \"right\" being taken away doesn't change that reality. That's just another way of looking at it.\n \n \nThat's pretty cynical, don't you think? It sounds like you are admitting this is just about discrimination against a couple because they are same sex. After all, if it's not about love, it's about recognizing, supporting and promoting the straight couples, but deliberately leaving out the gays for no reason.\n\n \n No, it's 'admitting' that love has nothing to do with anything here, either way, in terms of how the government sees marriage. It sees it as opposite-sex (as a fundamental standard). It doesn't see LOVE as a fundamental standard. If it did, there would be no Vegas marriages.\n \n \nThe courts have already determined that marriage is a right\n\n \n Sure, opposite sex marriage; that's fundamental to what marriage is.\n \n \nNonsense. I don't see the point of giving marriage benefits(for a couple) to a single person.\n\n \n See above post to Foundit where I listed some of the benefits. If you're really for equality, you have to support something like that to be consistent.\n \n \nPolygamy is against the law.\n\n \n Of all the arguments I see thrown out there to try and avoid having to consider any comparisons to gay marriage such as polygamy, this is the most ironic. If legality were any prerequisite for whether something is right or wrong, gay rights of ANY kind would never have been granted. And then you ironically bring up the \"decriminalization of homosexuality\" in the next sentence.\n \n \nWhen and if society goes down that road, to possible, decriminalization or legalization of polygamy, the arguments will be different than ones against homophobic prejudice and sex discrimination.\n \n \n Society is already down the road of broadening marriage, Jake. That's the issue. It's not just about being broadened in that ONE area, it's about broadening marriage PERIOD, and whether it should be a broadenable institution. You're not just fighting for gay marriage, you're fighting for marriage equality, and you don't even know it, apparently.\n \n \nPolygamy is not a sexual orientation. It's a type of religious behaviour. \n\n \n Irrelevant. Behavior-based discrimination is still discrimination, and would require the same demands you place on so-called \"orientation\" based discrimination. (Though that's really not the issue at the heart of religious objection, even in the case of gay marriage, anyway.) If you really want marriage equality, then marriage has to be wide open.",

And the people who would believe in my claim because I told them to would be gullible.\n Just because I could say \"But I really, really, really believe it to be true\" doesn't refute the nature of the origins of the claim.\n \n \n \nAre there ever going to be any reasons you wouldn't just wave off as not REAL? Why should anyone play your game when you're determined to not take anything as \"real\" to begin with?\n\n Yes to your first question.\n Pdwackey or whatever your abbreviation is for your second.\n And noticably, you avoided answering my question.\n I'll take that as a no.\n \n \n \nActually, I DO think such a thing is a danger eventually if left unchecked. I think ANY position can be taken too far if not reigned in.\n\n WHAT are we ACTUALLY talking about here???\n We're talking about GAY EQUALITY moving forward, but YOU are actually talking about religious rights MOVING BACKWARDS.\n It's the ploy of the religious right to play on the fears of others and deny RIGHTS to people based on unsubstantiated fears.\n \n Our position \"taken too far\" is that gays get full equality. Government doesn't care if we are gay or straight. It treats us all equally.\n That has nothing to do with religion losing rights.\n \n Religion losing POWER as it tries to governmentally limit gays is ENTIRELY DIFFERENT... emoticon_ic\n \n \n \nNot if it's not a valid right to begin with, in terms of society.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Yep. You're back to trying to frame ALL governmental discussions in term of \"society\" instead of recognizing them as GOVERNMENTAL discussions...\n And it WAS a \"valid right\".\n The California Supreme Court RULED their recognition.\n \n THEY are an authority on rights recognition.\n \n \n \nBut again, if you think it's so unAmerican to be able to do that, one would think you'd be making a big issue of the BALLOT INITIATIVE RULES which allows for such a thing to happen.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n You repeatedly pull this lame stunt whereby you pretend that people's opinions are all one dimensional, and that conflicting situations don't exist...\n I would love to see your analysis if it were RELIGION's rights which were up on the chopping block.\n Would you recognize \"unAmerican\" if it were YOUR behind it were going to affect?\n \n \n \nSort of like claiming to be for equality when it's really just the gay marriage that you're about (in terms of marriage).\n\n Cowardly non-sequitur.\n I am for equality when there is no legitimate state interest for preventing it.\n You should know that by now.\n \n \n \nTax breaks.\n\n The tax breaks are on DUAL incomes, if they even fit in that tax section in the first place.\n There are some income situations that it's a tax PENALTY.\n \n \n \nEasier obtaining of loans and credit.\n\n Can you elaborate on this claim?\n Cause if it's just another case where \"You have two people, and thus more income to solidify the loan/credit\", your reply is nonsense.\n \n \n \nThe extra income of another SS check.\n\n Which comes cause you have another person...\n \n \n \nMore likelihood of adoption.\n\n Cause you have MORE PEOPLE TO CARE for the kid.\n \n \n \nFamily rates for insurance and other needs.

   "But you might as well be talking about them. You might as well be saying prejudice is what's behind THOSE examples. If you can't even prove prejudice, then you really don't need to be making the accusation.\n\n \n I doubt it. We're talking about two different realities. People don't choose to be gay, it's just who we are. There's no automobile or electricity user or pork eater identity which is as profound as homosexual or heterosexual identity. It could never be that way. \n \n \nThe 'identity' part isn't what the religious issue is about.\n\n \n Yet you speak of the need of religious leaders to speak out against homosexuality. Homosexuality is the homosexual's identity.\n \n \n(shrug) It's the only reason needed. People are free to oppose for ANY reason they want. This isn't a gestapo state we live in where people can't oppose things they believe is wrong.\n\n \n But it resembles a theocracy when you tell one group they can't have something because of one religious view, not everyone shares.\n \n \nI'm not imposing any doctrines on your life. You don't have to adopt my doctrines at all.\n\n \n If you are saying I can't be married because I am gay, and your religion says so, then YES you are imposing the doctrines of your church on my life. It doesn't matter whether or not I attend your church, you think I should govern my life by its rules anyway.\n \n \nWell ... yeah. If you're a U.S. citizen, you are more than welcome to try and change society and laws toward what you think is right for society. That's what everyone does--try to change things toward their morality and values. You may not get far, but this is a free country and if you're a citizen you are indeed free to participate in its system. Pretty cool, really. emoticon_xagree\n\n \n There is also a Constitution which guarantees rights. Oh, but are you saying put everything to a free vote? Do you not see how the minority is in a disadvantaged position, when the majority votes on its rights? Do you think the majority is going to vote against the majority's rights?\n \n \nIt's interesting that you won't take any examples to compare to gay marriage when it doesn't fit what you want things to be (the polygamy comparison), but you will not hesitate to make other comparisons like these.\n\n \n It's more comparable, because we are only talking about one difference, either race or sex. The state does have an interest in limiting the number of people entering a contract, which would be impossible under polygamy. Two: polygamy is illegal. Three: polygamy centres around issues of limits of religious freedom. Four: Legalized polygamy is not on the discussion table.\n \n \nYeah but one does not legitimize a completely different sort of behavioral relationship, while the other does. An African American couple having an opposite-sex relationship is STILL an opposite-sex relationship.\n\n \n It seems right there, you are saying the difference is GENDER, not behaviour.\n \n \nNo, that would involve an intent to deceive. Odds are the LDS church really did believe what they were saying.\n\n \n I wouldn't bet on it.\n \n \nAnd is whether or not it incites violence a judgment call, or are there specific quantifiable standards they go by to determine that in terms of the speech? 'Cause \"inciting violence\" sounds like one of those things the government could throw out there as a value judgment to use as an excuse to supress speech. History has shown us governments aren't really so trustworthy.\n\n \n It's clear what people mean when they promote or incite violence. And at any rate, we have the processes in place to settle those disputes. I'm not sure what you are looking for when you speak of \"quantifiable standards\". We have to make a judgment at some point. \n \n \nWell that's what everyone does. It's just that the balance in some places varies depending on what's considered more important. Restricting free speech isn't so balanced at all, IMO.\n\n \n It can be balanced, if it protects a vulnerable minority. We're really get way off topic though. The point is, Canada is different on these issues.\n \n \nThanks for another reminder of why I don't live in Canada! No offense, but I don't think police should have that much power over people.\n\n \n Lol. It's just a very short chat usually, at a random roadblock during a high drinking season, then you're back on your way. They don't taser or beat anyone. The view is that people won't drink and drive, because they don't know where and when the cops will set up. It's seen as a reasonable balance between individual rights, and benefitting the group through less drunk driving.\n \n \n(Shrug) Sure; but it's still defining an institution. That doing so results in a \"right\" being taken away doesn't change that reality. That's just another way of looking at it.\n\n \n Yes, but the court ruled they had the right, then it was taken away.\n \n \nNo, it's 'admitting' that love has nothing to do with anything here, either way, in terms of how the government sees marriage. It sees it as opposite-sex (as a fundamental standard). It doesn't see LOVE as a fundamental standard.

I know what I'm fighting for. It's your endless parade of fallacies, that is meant to try to muddy the waters and confuse.\n \n \nIrrelevant.

(Though that's really not the issue at the heart of religious objection, even in the case of gay marriage, anyway.) If you really want marriage equality, then marriage has to be wide open.\n\n \n No. That's not true. And history proves it, in terms of other accomodations to equality. Also, marriage for gay couples has been tried, in several countries, and it hasn't led down the slippery slope. No one here in Canada, buys your false dilemma or slippery slope nonsense anymore. Although, this was the last desperate argument of those standing against the winds of change, as those changes happened. My favourite was a church reverend marching saying, seemingly wanting to be taken seriously \"now someone will want to marry Fluffy(meaning the common name for a cat)\". One columnist, in the Edmonton Journal, supportive of same-sex marriage joked, \"hey have you seen my beagle? At least a dog wouldn't complain about the same dinner every night\". And yes, that polygamy thing was bandied about just as much.\n \n Jyoshu: If Jane has an orange and Todd also gets one, the principle of equality in oranges is extended to Todd. We don't necessarily have to give an orange to Matt.",

That's ironic because that's a perfect description of what you do in reverse.\n \n \nMy argument is not \"I'm just talking about gay marriage, so saying *pedophile marriage* or *polygamy marriage* should be ignored\".\n Again, you ignore my ACTUAL arguments and my ACTUAL positions to pretend that my position is something it is CLEARLY NOT.\n\n \n No; people can't have an honest discussion about just gay marriage without bringing in the issue of marriage in general. It's like trying to discuss the implications of restricting prayer, but trying to ONLY limit the discourse to how it would effect Christians and not religion or other religions overall. You DO want it just to be about \"gay marriage only\", otherwise you wouldn't balk at all the implications of making marriage a changeable institution. \n \n \n1) CLAFCLO.\n COMPLETELY CLAFCLO.\n Your response shows absolutely NOTHING that I said wrong.\n \n \n 2) And again, you MOVE THE GOALPOSTS...\n I specifically stated that Prop 8 REMOVED a right from gays.\n And you respond by saying that Prop 8 changed the constitution???\n Duh! Absolutely NO contradiction with what I said.\n They CHANGED the constitution to REMOVE THE RIGHT of gay marriage.\n\n \n You said \n \n \"The California Supreme Court RULED their recognition.\n \n THEY are an authority on rights recognition.\"\n \n Foundit, the 'authority' doesn't apply anymore, when the basis of it's authority has CHANGED. Prop 8 was about amending the constitution--that's WHAT IT WAS. That's WHAT IT DID. It didn't have to act in accordance with a constitutional right.  It WAS the determination REGARDING the right.\n \n Also, stop trying to use this \"CLAFCLO\" to avoid having the discussion go anywhere other than specifically where YOU want it to go. You aren't the owner of these discussions, and I'll continue to point out other implications even if it's not within the rather narrow path you want to control the discussion going. What I said was NOT an example of this silly \"CLAFCLO\" thing of yours, by your own standards of what it is. YOU made the claim; I pointed out how your claim is misguided to begin with. Then you throw the term out as a cop out when the problem with your argument is made clear. \n \n \nI welcome you to quote ANYWHERE where that analogy would not apply.\n I was NOT saying that the new Prop 8 was invalid because of the old court ruling.\n\n \n Reverse CLAFCLO. I didn't SAY that's what you said, Foundit. I didn't CLAIM you were saying prop 8 was invalid for that reason. STOP misrepresenting ME in your false claims of misrepresentation. \n \n Geez, it's getting to where everything you do seems to be based on disingenuousness. emoticon_xdonno Just DISCUSS.\n \n You are again misrepresenting my argument.\n \n \nTHIS is part of the reason other people don't like talking to you...\n You don't argue honestly.\n\n \n Translation: \"I'm not getting to define the discussion only in the narrow way that I want and that's advantageous to me, so I'm throwing out a claim that he's being dishonest when it's really me that's doing it. Oh and faux claim that everyone's against him too.\" \n \n (an ironic one at that, because that's exactly why people don't engage Foundit!)\n \n \nTo get you to realize the answer to your challenge, I asked you a question you ignored.\n I would love to see your analysis if it were RELIGION's rights which were up on the chopping block.\n Would you recognize \"unAmerican\" if it were YOUR behind it were going to affect?\n \n When you answer that, we'll be further along the road to you understanding the answer to your question, and I will happily elaborate.\n\n \n Sorry, but if I was going to whine about 'rights being voted down\", I'd consider the whole PROCESS that makes it possible, rather than JUST focusing on those who did the voting. THAT'S the point I was making. \n \n And by the way, the whole \"unAmerican\" terminology there is just rhetoric, by the way. Who determines what is \"American\" or not, anyway?\n \n \nUntil then, I'm not going to waste answer time on a guy who clearly misrepresent my arguments and refuses to answer simple questions.\n\n \n ROTFLOL!! It's certainly never stopped you from filling threads with your verbose posts, before. Why should anyone think you're suddenly going to stop for ANY reason (much less the false one you gave)? You quite simply have the need to always get the last word in, Foundit. So we'll see if you can own up to your statement and resist replying.",

   "I doubt it. We're talking about two different realities. People don't choose to be gay, it's just who we are. There's no automobile or electricity user or pork eater identity which is as profound as homosexual or heterosexual identity. It could never be that way.\n \n \n But the \"who we are\" aspect isn't what the religious objection is over. It has nothing to do with it.\n \n \nYet you speak of the need of religious leaders to speak out against homosexuality.\n\n \n When religious people use that term, that just means the actions. The relationships and sexual actions. That's typically what religious people are talking about when they use that term.\n \n \nBut it resembles a theocracy when you tell one group they can't have something because of one religious view, not everyone shares.\n\n \n (Shrug) ANYTIME you have a country changed to the values of one group that wins out over others, that's what happens. The country changes to those values. The only way to avoid that would be to do away with democracy altogether, and no one wants that. \n \n \nIf you are saying I can't be married because I am gay, and your religion says so\n\n \n No one is saying you can't be married \"because you're gay.\" The opposition to gay marriage is because of what IT is. IT is an action that goes against religious beliefs. From religion's standpoint, this is all about ACTIONS. You might as well be talking about not eating pork.\n \n \nThere is also a Constitution which guarantees rights. Oh, but are you saying put everything to a free vote?\n\n \n The only thing that was put to a vote here was the constitution ITSELF. It has be able to be changed--amended. If people don't want an amendable constitution, they need to lobby to change it in THAT way. \n \n \nIt's more comparable, because we are only talking about one difference, either race or sex ...\n\n \n That's only because you've chosen, in THIS discussion, to limit yourself to THOSE particular qualifiers. There's no reason it should be held to only THOSE qualifiers, though.\n \n \nThe state does have an interest in limiting the number of people entering a contract, which would be impossible under polygamy.\n\n \n Why? What is it's interest in doing that?\n \n \nTwo: polygamy is illegal ...\n\n \n I've already explained why that reason is invalid. If that were all that was needed to invalidate something, gays would never have had ANY rights.\n \n \nThree: polygamy centres around issues of limits of religious freedom. \n\n \n Irrelevant. If it's something people want to do, and you haven't proven your state interest for the discrimination (which you clearly haven't), they get to do it! It has to be legalized, according to gay marriage logic.\n \n \nFour: Legalized polygamy is not on the discussion table.\n\n \n Ok, so if people just say gay marriage is 'off the table', case closed? no gay marriage, eh? You're really not using logic here at all in this.\n \n \nIt seems right there, you are saying the difference is GENDER, not behaviour.\n\n \n sure, in terms of the behavior. There's behavior that's same-sex, and behavior that's opposite-sex.\n \n \nIt's clear what people mean when they promote or incite violence. \n\n \n So you're ONLY talking about cases where people say \"go out and hit a gay person\"? It has to be speech that clearly specifically promotes doing that? I'm a little concerned about the \"incite\" term. That's much more vague.\n \n \nThat is silly. Why would you give benefits and recognition of two people for \n one person?\n\n \n See post above on this where I list benefits couples get over single people. Also, there are cases where a single person might want benefits given with someone he's NOT married to (a best friend, for instance.) The point is, of course, that gay marriage is nothing more than a band-aid for one little thing, if marriage equality is really something you're after.",

   "no, the idea that it represents people being their \"worst\" is just Foundit giving his opinion because that's they way HE sees it.\n\n A thoroughly meaningless reply.\n I explained WHY it's \"worst\" territory.\n A minority group, gays, had a right recognized by the state.\n The majority voted to IGNORE the court and to discriminate against the minority group's rights.\n THAT is why I see it as \"worst\".\n \n \n \nThough for sure, to portray people voting their conscience as the \"worst\" of human behavior just because you don't like it is good tactical propaganda on your part, no doubt.\n\n Again, you try to rephrase the issue but it is MEANINGLESS.\n When racist bigots voted to prevent blacks from having equality, THEY WERE ALSO \"people voting their conscience\".\n Just because it's their \"conscience\" doesn't mean squat about how bad they are REALLY behaving.\n \n \n \nemoticon_rolleyes How long are you going to harp on this?\n\n Funny.\n This is the first time I actually brought this up regarding this angle.\n You're once again trying to misrepresent my argument by posting only a snippet of my position. I am not complaining about \"money spent elsewhere\".\n Let me repeat so it is more obvious how you are misrepresenting me...\n The anti-gay side often puts out the chant \"let's put it up to the states\", but when it comes down to a state court ruling, they pump in MILLIONS from outside the state to insert false propaganda to get people to overturn it.\n That's my issue.\n How can people proclaim it's a \"state\" issue when obviously NON-state citizens pump in millions to force their non-state position?\n \n \n \nLOL. That's ironic because that's a perfect description of what you do in reverse.\n\n Gee. You mean when I look at people who are trying to discriminate against me and deprive me of equality, I paint them as the bad guy?\n When you look at people trying to achieve equality, you paint them as the bad guy...\n If you can't see how the \"perfect description\" says a LOT more about you than me, then you're really missing the point...\n \n \n \nNo; people can't have an honest discussion about just gay marriage without bringing in the issue of marriage in general.

You DO want it just to be about \"gay marriage only\", otherwise you wouldn't balk at all the implications of making marriage a changeable institution.\n\n In the DISCUSSION on gay marriage, I am open to every MARRIAGE aspect.\n When it comes to LEGALIZING forms of marriage, I am specific, and I GIVE REASONS for being specific.\n \n We could just as easily turn this around on you from a pre-Loving v Virginia perspective.\n You would want interracial marriage recognized, right?\n But OTHER forms of marriage, like polygamy or pedophile marriage, would be forbidden?\n \n You really don't see how meaningless your complaint truly is.\n YES. I have boundaries. EVERYBODY does. \n \n \n \nYou said \n \"The California Supreme Court RULED their recognition.\n THEY are an authority on rights recognition.\"\n \n Foundit, the 'authority' doesn't apply anymore, when the basis of it's authority has CHANGED. Prop 8 was about amending the constitution--that's WHAT IT WAS. That's WHAT IT DID. It didn't have to act in accordance with a constitutional right.  It WAS the determination REGARDING the right.\n\n I honestly don't know what you think you're arguing about.\n The California Supreme Court DID RULE their recognition. Do you deny that? NO.\n The california Supreme Court is the authority on rights recognition. Do you deny that? I think not.\n \n Your reply is completely non-sequitur to what the ORIGINAL point was before you started MOVING THE GOAL-POSTS.\n \n I pointed out that the people REMOVED A RIGHT from gays.\n It WAS a right, cause the California Supreme Court recognized it as such.\n \n You then proceed on with this non-sequitur tangent.\n I am not saying that the previous California court ruling somehow supercedes Prop 8. I never said that.\n I know Prop 8 was about amending the constitution.

YOU made the claim; I pointed out how your claim is misguided to begin with. Then you throw the term out as a cop out when the problem with your argument is made clear.\n\n I recommend that the people look at what Jyoshu JUST DID.\n He SPECIFICALLY REFERENCED my comments, to explain where I was supposedly wrong.\n Then, he turns around and insists that I can't point out \"CLAFCLO\", as he puts it, \"to avoid having the discussion go anywhere other than specifically where I want it to go\"...\n \n ROFLMAO!\n HOW can he quote me, pretend to point out a flaw IN MY ARGUMENT, and then balk at the fact that I point out that he IS NOT TALKING ABOUT MY ARGUMENT in his pretense of pointing out my flaw????\n It's absurdity to the point of hysteria!\n \n I'm not sorry Jyoshu that when you pull these absurd stunts in trying to directly refute me by talking about something THAT IS NOT MY ARGUMENT, I WILL call you on it.\n The real solution is for you to stop doing CLAFCLO. \n \n \n \nReverse CLAFCLO. I didn't SAY that's what you said, Foundit. I didn't CLAIM you were saying prop 8 was invalid for that reason. STOP misrepresenting ME in your false claims of misrepresentation.\n\n Hey Jyoshu?\n Wake up and smell the coffee.\n I NEVER SAID that you claimed I said that.\n I was pointing out that your analogy WOULD ONLY APPLY if that situation were true.\n IF I were saying \"the new Prop 8 was invalid because of the old court ruling\", THEN your analogy would make sense.\n But I was NOT saying that.\n Your analogy makes NO sense in the context of what I am ACTUALLY saying and the ACTUAL analogy you put forth.\n \n And can I just say that it is absolutely HE-LARIOUS that you went from \"sniffle, sniffle. Foundit66 needs to stop using CLAFCLO\" to you turning around and trying to \"reverse CLAFCLO\" me.\n \n \n \nGeez, it's getting to where everything you do seems to be based on disingenuousness. emoticon_xdonno Just DISCUSS.\n\n Paddiwacky or whatever your term is...\n \n \n \nTranslation: \"I'm not getting to define the discussion only in the narrow way that I want and that's advantageous to me, so I'm throwing out a claim that he's being dishonest when it's really me that's doing it.

WITH STATING NAMES of poll respondents.\n You can have all your Archies and Ethmis and Steeeeve's on your side.\n I am comfortable with the REAL population of this board and their opinion of me.\n \n \n \nSorry, but if I was going to whine about 'rights being voted down\", I'd consider the whole PROCESS that makes it possible, rather than JUST focusing on those who did the voting. THAT'S the point I was making. \n And by the way, the whole \"unAmerican\" terminology there is just rhetoric, by the way. Who determines what is \"American\" or not, anyway?\n\n Yeah. I didn't expect an honest answer to that question.\n I basically wanted to show that YOU couldn't be trusted to honestly answer a question when put to you...\n \n To address your question, people are able to say and do all sorts of things I don't approve of.\n Lie about gays. Post under multiple sock puppet IDs for dishonesty's sake. etc, etc...\n But I believe in free speech, and as such I simply fight back against the lies.\n \n So while I believe in human equality, I also believe in mechanisms which have a risk of allowing equality, without a legitimate state interest, to be trampled.\n At the same time, I am keeping a bigger picture in mind.\n This is a set-back, that is true.\n But like I have pointed out, it's temporary. Look at the ORIGINAL anti-gay marriage law vote, and compare it to the Prop 8 vote.\n Quite a drop in voting percentages, huh.\n The anti-gay marriage crowd is losing their steam. Obama's going to be president, and more than likely we will quickly see ENDA passed. Federal anti-sexual orientation hate crime laws will be passed.\n And while I don't expect gay marriage now, the trends are clear. Eventually we'll get it by majority vote, if necessary.\n \n Bigger picture here. The bigots may have scored a point, but they're still backpeddling down the field.\n \n \n \nROTFLOL!! It's certainly never stopped you from filling threads with your verbose posts, before.\n\n Let me reiterate for you to see the important part you missed...\n \"Until then, I'm not going to waste answer time on a guy who clearly misrepresent my arguments and refuses to answer simple questions.\"\n I was simply pointing out that I wasn't going to waste time answering your question when you hadn't answered mine. When you were using a question TO DEFLECT from answering my question.\n Either way, I later realized that, from experience, you could keep that obfuscational junk up indefinitely. You can't be trusted to answer questions honestly, much less respond honestly to other people's arguments. So after exposing you, I answered anyways.",

After all this carrying on you're doing, at the end of the day it's just you trying to portray your position as a moral high ground. There's no morality committee that determines you're position is more in-line with what black people went through than just trying to write special rights into law and redefine marriage. There's nothing special about your position that makes it more like THAT than polygamists trying to change marriage to include them. You'll point out differences between your movement and polygamy, and I'll point out differences between your movement and civil rights. It's all just jockeying; the difference is, you're not willing to admit that and I am. \n \n BOTH may be cases of voting their conscience but it does NOT mean THIS is a case of people behaving badly. I never said voting their conscience equates with NOT behaving badly. An analogy does not necessarily... an accurate assessment, make.\n \n \nHow can people proclaim it's a \"state\" issue when obviously NON-state citizens pump in millions to force their non-state position?\n\n \n Then you don't understand when people talk about the whole state-issue versus federal. They're making a statement about two different forms of PROCESS, and saying they favor one over other the other. Saying something is a state issue isn't the same as a person saying I have no interest in it if it's not in my state. Saying something is a state issue is a statement about your opinion of how the PROCESS should work. It's not a disavowal of the issue just because it doesn't happen to be the state you live in. Surely there are some things even you think should be a state-level issue, but if it's an issue you felt was important, you might still donate toward a cause even if it's a state issue taking place OTHER than your state.\n \n \nGee. You mean when I look at people who are trying to discriminate against me and deprive me of equality, I paint them as the bad guy?\n\n \n Well, when you base that on a begging-the-question statement and premise (\"they're trying to deprive me of equality\"), yes. Again, that's all your opinion, and you're painting them as a bad guy when they may not all BE bad guys. They may just be trying to do what their religion is to do.

EVERYBODY does. \n\n \n Oh my god, Katy bar the door ... emoticon_wow\n \n We may actually be making a breakthrough here. Now that you say you have boundaries, and that EVERYONE does, are you willing to consider that some people's boundaries of how marriage should be defined has even OTHER boundaries, like ... that it needs to be between a man and a woman?\n \n After all, YOU (by your own admission) have boundaries, and when those boundaries deny equality to people who may want to be a 3-person marriage, your \"legitimate state interest\" thing pretty much goes right out the window ...\n \n Let me guess though ... your boundaries are legit, and their's aren't. It all comes down to opinion.\n \n You're right, EVERYONE has boundaries. Why you feel yours are superior is what I wonder.\n \n \nYou then proceed on with this non-sequitur tangent.\n I am not saying that the previous California court ruling somehow supercedes Prop 8.

I suspect most people here are getting weary of these discussions and the CLAFCLOW on CLAFCLOW on CLAFCLOW \"I didn't say you said I said that you said\" junk that you've gotten to where you drag nearly every discussion down to.

I didn't expect an honest answer to that question.\n I basically wanted to show that YOU couldn't be trusted to honestly answer a question when put to you...\n\n \n Mmm hmmm. Suuuure that was what you were \"trying to show.\" LOL. I've noticed that a tactic you resort to is that you do sometimes switch to saying you were actually trying to 'prove something about ME' when your arguments fail to prove something about the ISSUES. I guess because when that failure happens it shows problems with your OWN thinking, and doing that switch on your part helps you avoid that facing that reality.\n \n (Now likely here comes Foundit's \"ROTFLMAO\" act.)\n \n \nTo address your question, people are able to say and do all sorts of things I don't approve of.\n\n \n You really miss the point here. The point is that if people are going to complain that their rights are being VOTED away, one would think they would try to take away the ability for someone's rights to be voted away. \n \n \nSo while I believe in human equality, I also believe in mechanisms which have a risk of allowing equality, without a legitimate state interest, to be trampled.\n\n \n So, is that a way to say you support ballot initiative voting on civil rights? Sure sounds like it to me. Come on out and say it, you can do it. :)\n \n \nThe anti-gay marriage crowd is losing their steam. Obama's going to be president, and more than likely we will quickly see ENDA passed. Federal anti-sexual orientation hate crime laws will be passed.\n\n \n It's possible. I think those would be great changes, as people need to not have to suffer any discrimination in the workplace, military, etc. Hopefully, Obama will come through with those things. However, Obama has the problem of needing to not give the impression of over-reaching with things that conservatives would consider as over-reaching. I don't consider them as such, but some might. I think people are setting themselves up for disappointment with this putting their hope in 'Obama the messiah'.\n \n \nSo after exposing you, I answered anyways.\n\n \n yeah, I didn't think you would do what you said there, even for a second.",

After all this carrying on you're doing, at the end of the day it's just you trying to portray your position as a moral high ground.\n\n Over and over again your replies are meaningless.\n Why can't I use your exact same response against you?\n \n I explained WHY it was \"prejudice\". You reply with some meaningless comment about \"conscience\", that DOES NOT PRECLUDE \"prejudice\" at all.\n In fact, you fail to give any REASON for objection (beyond just you objecting) as to why EVERY bigot out there is probably working off of \"conscience\".\n You give no argument against what I ACTUALLY said, and instead give this vague whine that is essentially pointless.\n \n \n \nThere's no morality committee that determines you're position is more in-line with what black people went through than just trying to write special rights into law and redefine marriage.\n\n I never claimed there was.\n I simply give my arguments to the best of my abilities, and watch as you basically fail to do anything like that.\n I've already pointed out that the reasons interracial marriage was wrong and unconstitutional HAD NOTHING to do with \"what black people went through\".\n The whole pretense of \"special rights\" is propagandic and meaningless. And when I reply that it's obviously the HETEROSEXUALS who have special rights with their marriage recognition, I can expect with confidence that you'll avoid trying to argue the point any further.\n \n \n \nThere's nothing special about your position that makes it more like THAT than polygamists trying to change marriage to include them.

Over and over again, your replies are meaningless while you avoid discussing the actual subject.\n \n For example, I give reasons WHY polygamists fail the EXISTING \"legitimate state interest\" standards. There are ALREADY COURT RULINGS on this, explaining the \"legitimate state interests\" for why polygamy fails.\n But you ignore all that in favor of just saying \"somebody could claim that ...\", and then you throw out an argument that NOT EVEN YOU believe.\n So why the heck should anybody else believe there is no legitimate state interest when it's obvious that you don't even believe the excuse you throw out there...\n \n \n \nIt's all just jockeying; the difference is, you're not willing to admit that and I am. \n\n No.\n You're trying to accuse me of being guilty of something you CLEARLY ARE guilty of.\n \n \n \nBOTH may be cases of voting their conscience but it does NOT mean THIS is a case of people behaving badly. I never said voting their conscience equates with NOT behaving badly. An analogy does not necessarily... an accurate assessment, make.\n\n And thus, you have done it again.\n Have you given ANY REASON for anybody to believe this is not a case of \"people behaving badly\"? No.\n I HAVE given reasons why. They voted to REMOVE A STATE RECOGNIZED RIGHT from a minority group.\n \n And you have done NOTHING to address the reason I have given.\n Instead, you reduce this to a situation where you give a meaningless reply. I point out your reply was meaningless. And then you turn around with this absurdly pointless reply that can be boiled down to \"just cause I gave a meaningless reply doesn't make you right\".\n Well duh! I'm not claiming I'm right just cause you can't argue the point.\n I am claiming I am right, and I GIVE REASONS WHY I think I am right.\n \n And then OTHERS on this board can JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES!\n Isn't it AMAZING how that works Jyoshu???\n \n \n \nThen you don't understand when people talk about the whole state-issue versus federal. They're making a statement about two different forms of PROCESS, and saying they favor one over other the other.\n\n Again, you're giving a non-response.\n Federal can be best summed up as group sovreignty.\n State sovreignty is defined by the state making up its own mind. Its own decisions.\n \n I have no doubt that some people are abusing the idea of \"state's rights\" in an effort to try to prevent the federal government from doing what happened in Loving v Virginia. But the ESSENCE of the state's rights, which is what anti-gay marriage advocates try to invoke, is something that the anti-gay marriage advocates violate.\n \n \n \nWell, when you base that on a begging-the-question statement and premise (\"they're trying to deprive me of equality\"), yes. Again, that's all your opinion, and you're painting them as a bad guy when they may not all BE bad guys.\n\n Quote me where I said they were all bad guys...\n Otherwise, your reply is another meaningless observation... \n \n \n \nThey may just be trying to do what their religion is to do. Not that experience tells me you're going to consider that.\n\n Jyoshu, I have no idea what \"experience\" you think you're invoking.\n If you actually WERE to ACCURATELY relay \"experience\", you'd admit that I believe \"what their religion is to do\" is MEANINGLESS.\n Just because their religion tells them to do something doesn't mean they aren't bad guys.\n And this is where you turn around and say \"I never said that\", ignoring the fact that WITHOUT that type of exclusionary situation, your comment is meaningless.\n \n It's like trying to argue against \"these guys are bad guys\" with a response \"these guys are religious\". That response is meaningless.\n \n \n \nWe may actually be making a breakthrough here.\n\n Translation?\n Jyoshu is about to uproot the goalposts and move them to an Australian football field.\n \n \n \nAfter all, YOU (by your own admission) have boundaries, and when those boundaries deny equality to people who may want to be a 3-person marriage, your \"legitimate state interest\" thing pretty much goes right out the window ...\n\n Bangs head against wall...\n Jyoshu, I've pointed out before that you DO NOT understand the LEGAL application of \"legitimate state interest\".\n Yet you pretend to use it over and over and over again.\n \n To clear up this, it is NOT JUST MY \"legitimate state interest\".\n This \"legitimate state interest\" has already been established in EXISTING court rulings.\n \n \n \nLet me guess though ... your boundaries are legit, and their's aren't. It all comes down to opinion.\n\n Except I am NOT JUST QUOTING MY opinion.\n I am referencing OTHER evidence, and you keep pretending it's \"just me talking with just my opinion\"...\n I am referencing COURT APPLICATION of \"legitimate state interest\". COURT RULINGS demonstrating flaws in claimed \"legitimate state interest\".\n \n \n \nSo then you realize that there's nothing unconstitutional about prop 8, then?\n\n Did I ever say it was?\n \n Prop 8 was necessary to change the constitution to prevent its wording from being unconstitutional.\n The WORDING of prop 8, as just a law, is unconstitutional.\n Prop 8 being an amendment changed the constitution.\n The wording you used is imprecise, so I elaborate.\n \n \n \nFoundit, I really think you're giving the nitpicks you carry on here too much credit--I really doubt all that many people care.\n\n 1) To borrow your words...\n Well, nice to know you think of quite a few people here as \"nitpicks\". I love it when you show your true colors, Jyoshu.\n \n 2) Not just here, but numerous other boards...\n And it's not just \"my\" nitpicks, is it Jyoshu.\n Like I said, I would LOVE to start a poll....\n \n \n \nI suspect most people here are getting weary of these discussions and the CLAFCLOW on CLAFCLOW on CLAFCLOW \"I didn't say you said I said that you said\" junk that you've gotten to where you drag nearly every discussion down to. I know *I'm* getting weary of it.\n\n We both know that I am by far NOT the only one to put the standards of CLAFCLO against you.\n I'm just the first who decided to abbreviate it so I don't have to keep saying the same thing over and over and over again...\n \n \n \nYeah, yeah, 'I never said that you said that I said that you said, yada yada yada.' \n Geez, enough already, Foundit.\n\n No. Not enough.\n OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER again, you reply with stuff that is just thoroughly meaningless UNLESS one other thing is true (or contended to be true).\n And then you fall short in that final item.\n \n So I will keep pointing that out.\n Maybe I need a new abbreviation for that...\n \n \n \nMmm hmmm. Suuuure that was what you were \"trying to show.\"\n\n You complain about me not taking \"you believe...\" as a credible reason (and then thoroughly FAIL to give any solid example of that)...\n And then I tell you MY REASON WHY I did something, and you mock it...\n \n Who knows my motivation better Jyoshu? You or me?\n Never mind. Another honest question you cannot honestly answer...\n \n \n \nI've noticed that a tactic you resort to is that you do sometimes switch to saying you were actually trying to 'prove something about ME' when your arguments fail to prove something about the ISSUES.\n\n Jyoshu, the ANSWER, if you had given an honest one, would have proven something ABOUT THE ISSUE.\n You REFUSING to honestly answer DOES prove something about YOU.\n Why is that difficult to comprehend?\n \n \n \nYou really miss the point here. The point is that if people are going to complain that their rights are being VOTED away, one would think they would try to take away the ability for someone's rights to be voted away. \n\n While that is a possibility, it is not the only one.\n You complain about people saying that Christians hate gays with regards to fight against gay rights.\n Do you want to remove people's right to say that they think Christians hate gays?\n \n I think that question is so obvious that it doesn't even matter if you refuse to honestly answer it...\n \n \n \nSo, is that a way to say you support ballot initiative voting on civil rights? Sure sounds like it to me. Come on out and say it, you can do it. :)\n\n No. I don't support ballot initiativese voting away people's civil rights.\n But just cause I don't support something doesn't mean I support the possibility being taken away.\n See above question regarding you and people's first amendment right to say \"Christians hate gays\".\n \n I swear. You let the smallest stuff baffle you in your pretense to show contradiction.\n \n \n \nIt's possible. I think those would be great changes, as people need to not have to suffer any discrimination in the workplace, military, etc. Hopefully, Obama will come through with those things. However, Obama has the problem of needing to not give the impression of over-reaching with things that conservatives would consider as over-reaching.\n\n What is this supposed problem with \"over-reaching\"?\n It sounds like just a lame ploy to try to limit Obama with imaginary standards that the last eight years probably never adhered to...\n \n \n \nI don't consider them as such, but some might. I think people are setting themselves up for disappointment with this putting their hope in 'Obama the messiah'.\n\n Maybe you should take that up with somebody who actually thinks of Obama as \"the messiah\".\n I have heard more people AGAINST Obama use that phrase...\n And actually, I have never heard anybody use that phrase FOR Obama.\n While I have no doubt they are out there, it's a case where there are more people COMPLAINING about it than there are actually DOING it...\n \n \n \nyeah, I didn't think you would do what you said there, even for a second.\n\n I guess you know what juvenile antics of yours wear people out quickest, eh Jyoshu?\n Also, I like to pride myself on answering HONEST questions, while we both know that to be your Achilles heel...\n \n In typing that post, I knew you wouldn't answer my question honestly.\n And without any surprise, you didn't even try to give my question an honest answer when I pointed out that you STILL WERE NOT answering it honestly...",

   "But the \"who we are\" aspect isn't what the religious objection is over. It has nothing to do with it.\n\n \n I think the lines do naturally get blurred. This is because the action is so closely tied to the sexual identity. We see this when religious people will admit they \"hate homosexuality\". \n \n \nWhen religious people use that term, that just means the actions. The relationships and sexual actions. That's typically what religious people are talking about when they use that term.\n\n \n It doesn't always mean that. And by the way, relationships take place in two people's head. A relationship is not an action. Furthermore, marriage is a legal contract, not a sexual action.\n \n \n(Shrug) ANYTIME you have a country changed to the values of one group that wins out over others, that's what happens. The country changes to those values.\n\n \n Shrugging, as you often do, jyoshu, doesn't address any issue for discussion. It doesn't say what is happening to the group, losing, is correct or just. \n \n \nThe only way to avoid that would be to do away with democracy altogether, and no one wants that.\n\n \n Luckily there are checks and balances. One of those is the court, where this issue is headed back.\n \n \nNo one is saying you can't be married \"because you're gay.\" The opposition to gay marriage is because of what IT is.\n\n \n Because of what gay marriage is? Oh, you mean the gay part?\n \n \nIT is an action that goes against religious beliefs. From religion's standpoint, this is all about ACTIONS. You might as well be talking about not eating pork.\n\n \n Marriage is not a sexual action. It's a legal contract between two atheists. I don't know what the married couple next door is doing in bed, if anything at all. Your religious objection is to homosexuality, and same-sex marriage is seen as a representation of that. It's absurd that you claim marriage is not about feelings of love, yet you think it's about mechanical sexual actions. What if I don't want your reigious views to affect my life?\n \n \nThe only thing that was put to a vote here was the constitution ITSELF. It has be able to be changed--amended. If people don't want an amendable constitution, they need to lobby to change it in THAT way.\n\n \n Some are arguing that this is more of a revision, and one can't make such changes on a fundamental recognized right to a specific group of people, in a fifty percent plus one type of popular vote.\n \n \nThat's only because you've chosen, in THIS discussion, to limit yourself to THOSE particular qualifiers. There's no reason it should be held to only THOSE qualifiers, though.\n\n \n Ok, what are the other unique qualifiers that connect it to polygamy? There aren't any. Please show me where polygamists have taken up the banner for \"equality\" as gay rights has. You can't. Saying someone might in the future, is not a reason to deny rights now. If we did that, we'd have to deny religious freedoms, upon which the polygamist argument is based. \n \n \nWhy? What is it's interest in doing that?\n\n \n Benefits. It's difficult for one man to look after so many women and children on his own. Many laws related to marriage concern monogamy. These would be undermined. Not so under gay marriage. \n \n \nI've already explained why that reason is invalid. If that were all that was needed to invalidate something, gays would never have had ANY rights.\n\n \n It's not invalid, the legality is quite valid. My point was, you can't circle the block, before you manage to take the first step out the door and onto the sidewalk. \n \n \nIrrelevant. If it's something people want to do, and you haven't proven your state interest for the discrimination (which you clearly haven't), they get to do it! It has to be legalized, according to gay marriage logic.\n\n \n NO, NO. NO!! The courts have already made the determination that people don't have a right to do it when it comes to polygamy. This isn't \"gay marriage logic\" either. Wow, jyoshu, you know, it's the reasoning behind many people's rights. Obviously these people got their rights, without legalizing polygamy. It doesn't make their rights any less important. It doesn't mean we were left with the two black or white stark choices: either give everyone an orange, or else we can't give Johnny an orange.\n \n \nOk, so if people just say gay marriage is 'off the table', case closed? no gay marriage, eh? You're really not using logic here at all in this.\n\n \n I'm using logic. You're not dealing in reality. Gay marriage IS what we're discussing as a society, right now. All you want to do is muddy the waters. Divert, because you don't have an argument. You haven't made the connection between gay marriage and polygamy. Your arguments are based on \"what ifs\". \n \n \nsure, in terms of the behavior. There's behavior that's same-sex, and behavior that's opposite-sex.\n\n \n No, the couples do the same sexual behaviours. It's oral or penetration, or stimulation with things like hands. \n \n \nSo you're ONLY talking about cases where people say \"go out and hit a gay person\"? It has to be speech that clearly specifically promotes doing that? I'm a little concerned about the \"incite\" term. That's much more vague.\n\n \n Other ways of saying the same thing, within a certain context, can reasonably be determined as conveying that same essential message. \n \n \nSee post above on this where I list benefits couples get over single people. Also, there are cases where a single person might want benefits given with someone he's NOT married to (a best friend, for instance.)\n\n \n Okay. So then we'd better not give benefits to straight married couples, until people can give them to their best friends.\n \n \nThe point is, of course, that gay marriage is nothing more than a band-aid for one little thing, if marriage equality is really something you're after.\n\n \n This doesn't logically follow from your previous point, and I don't understand what you mean.\n \n Ok, I understand now. I think you were trying to make the same false dilemma argument. Yet where is your evidence that we're limited to those two choices? We have much more evidence against your claim, from history, from society, FROM REALITY, showing us giving something to one group, extending a principle, without it having to be applied everywhere to everything. As I said your \"what if\", or \"someone might say\", or \"it's a belief\", game, is pretty old. You absurdly demand others prove things in absolute terms, while not offering a shred of evidence or logic for whatever the heck you are trying to say.",

Do you really think that if two men who were STRAIGHT got together and acted gay, or engaged in sexual activity for some reason, that these religious leaders would just step back and not condemn it since homosexuality wasn't really present as YOU define it? No way. They'd still condemn it, because the actions are what they're opposed to, not the nature thing.\n \n By the way, I didn't mean to infer that marriage is only a sexual thing.

Marriage has to have the fundamental aspect of being between a man and a woman to be marriage.\n \n \nSome are arguing that this is more of a revision\n\n \n Yeah, but that's just trying to desperately find a loophole; it reminds me of the sort of stunts people were doing trying to nullify votes after the 2000 election in FL.

If you're really for marriage equality, then it has to be marriage equality. Of MARRIAGE. \n \n \nBenefits. It's difficult for one man to look after so many women and children on his own.\n\n \n Tough.

Welcome to the world of marriage equality that you've demanded.\n \n \nNO, NO. NO!! The courts have already made the determination that people don't have a right to do it when it comes to polygamy.\n\n \n Tough. The courts had laws that made sure gay unions couldn't happen either--sodomy laws. Unfortunately for your situation, you really don't want to use the fact there are laws against something to argue against them having equal rights--it's a very easy reminder that it was that way for gays not so long ago.\n \n \nGay marriage IS what we're discussing as a society, right now. \n\n \n Yeah, but it's impossible to honestly discuss marriage (or even just gay marriage) without bringing up comparisons and implications to marriage overall, or other forms of marriage. It's like someone trying to discuss denying the right of prayer in schools, and ONLY talking about it from the standpoint of Christians and trying to purposely AVOID looking at the implications on any other religions or religion in general. Basically, your demand to avoid any comparisons is, well, unreasonable.\n \n \nOkay. So then we'd better not give benefits to straight married couples, until people can give them to their best friends.\n\n \n Well, there you go! At least you're starting to see the problem with this whole concept of opening up marriage. Short of doing away with it altogether or somehow opening it up to anyone with any arrangement that comes along, it's always going to be a non-equal institution.",

How do you explain religious so-called \"reparative\" efforts which include things such as prayer. How about the term \"ex-gay\"? Jesus healing people when it comes to homosexuality?\n \n \nAlright then, since you think nature is what they are opposing, think of it this way. Do you really think that if two men who were STRAIGHT got together and acted gay, or engaged in sexual activity for some reason, that these religious leaders would just step back and not condemn it since homosexuality wasn't really present as YOU define it? No way. They'd still condemn it, because the actions are what they're opposed to, not the nature thing.\n\n \n See above. Also, very unrealistic. Especially since they would likely not disclose it. And as long as homosexuality is kept in the closet, religious people don't seem to have a problem. It's when they see it represented out in the open that they rail against it.\n \n \nBy the way, I didn't mean to infer that marriage is only a sexual thing. It's just that I don't think what gays do is marriage, really. Marriage has to have the fundamental aspect of being between a man and a woman to be marriage.\n\n \n My point was(not surprised you ignore it) that gays don't do anything sexually upon the act marrying. So your objection is to what we represent in terms of our homosexuality.\n \n \nYeah, but that's just trying to desperately find a loophole; it reminds me of the sort of stunts people were doing trying to nullify votes after the 2000 election in FL. Everyone knew it was an amendment. The idea that is wasn't didn't even come up until some people didn't WANT it to be passed AFTER the vote.

I wrote unique. Love can apply in may instances. So, you'd best deny all marriages of love, if the love leads to a slippery slope. Also the polygamist DOES have the right to marry the ONE person he loves. And it's quite possible for the polygamist to fall in love with one person. Gay marriage is not increased cost to the state, as we are still talking about a couple, not a huge, unlimited group all depending on one patriarch. There are benefits, a ligitimate interest, to promoting monogamy, by laws related to marriage. The courts have ruled on the issue of legitimate interest. \n \n \nSince when should we wait to give marriage equality until someone starts demanding it, anyway? If you're really for marriage equality, then it has to be marriage equality. Of MARRIAGE.\n\n \n More of the \"what if\" game. It's not reality, and not a reason to deny rights to gays. I pointed out precisely how this is a freedom of religion issue, when it comes to polygamy. It's only you who seems to be arguing for polygamy. Perhaps I should go over on the religion thread and look at the actual reality of what is being argued by polygamists. Surely no one can be for religious rights, and not support polygamy. Actually, since those against same-sex marriage, point to tradition. Changing marriage back, is the return to tradition. If you believe in tradition, well, you must support all tradition, including polygamy. Otherwise, you are not really for tradition. \n \n \nTough. It's difficult to 'make' one man look after ANY SINGLE other man or woman, or one woman look after one other man ... etc. You don't deny equality because of that.\n\n \n Now we are off on this diversion. Are you arguing for polygamy or not? \n \n \nAgain, tough. Laws had to be changed to pave the way for GAY marriage too.\n\n \n More of the \"what if\" game. Prognosticating, isn't a reason to deny rights. \n \n \nYou opened this pandora's box my friend. Welcome to the world of marriage equality that you've demanded.\n\n \n Once again, show me where polygamists are arguing for \"equality\". No, they argue for religious freedoms. It's fitting that you point to a myth, \"pandora's box\", because a \"what if\" fantasy, is where you are in this debate. Indeed, I am not arguing for everything to be included. In fact, we may advance equality for one group, without it applying to everything. There is evidence for this in terms of other equal rights movements in history. Your fantasy has no evidence to support it.\n \n \nTough. The courts had laws that made sure gay unions couldn't happen either--sodomy laws. Unfortunately for your situation, you really don't want to use the fact there are laws against something to argue against them having equal rights--it's a very easy reminder that it was that way for gays not so long ago.\n\n \n And there are specific arguments for each case, when it comes to sodomy laws, which were used for gay and straight, and specific arguments in regards to polygamy. And sodomy laws were a different issue than the issue of the right to marry for gay couples. Yet again, you do what you acucuse others of by \"conflating\" issues. \n \n \nYeah, but it's impossible to honestly discuss marriage (or even just gay marriage) without bringing up comparisons and implications to marriage overall, or other forms of marriage. It's like someone trying to discuss denying the right of prayer in schools, and ONLY talking about it from the standpoint of Christians and trying to purposely AVOID looking at the implications on any other religions or religion in general. Basically, your demand to avoid any comparisons is, well, unreasonable.\n\n \n Your comparisons don't make sense. Actually, we had prayer in school for a long time, without having all sorts of prayers for all types of religions, including cults. Are you arguing for dropping marriage all together, as we did with prayer? I think there is a third option with marriage, as has been shown to work, by history. By experience, specifically related to gay marriage at this present time, where gay marriage exists. \n \n \nWell, there you go! At least you're starting to see the problem with this whole concept of opening up marriage. Short of doing away with it altogether or somehow opening it up to anyone with any arrangement that comes along, it's always going to be a non-equal institution.\n\n \n You can extend equality to one group, without including everything and anything. It's still the principle of equality. Just as sharing an orange between two people is still the concept of sharing. Kindly show me jyoshu, where this is proven not possible! Show me a shred of evidence that we can't and haven't done what I am suggesting, in many areas, including marriage. Where is your evidence jyoshu? I didn't say I was arguing to make it equal in absolute terms to include everything and anything. I said, equal marriage for same-sex couples.",

   "I don't buy it. How do you explain religious so-called \"reparative\" efforts which include things such as prayer. How about the term \"ex-gay\"? \n\n \n You've answered your own question with your example and don't even know it. The whole point behind the \"reparative therapy\" think is that change IS possible. So obviously those people don't think it's hard-wired. \"Ex-gay\" wouldn't work if that were the case. They wouldn't be pushing a \"therapy\" solution if they didn't think it were even possible for it to work. The reparative therapy movement is a good example of how many religious people DON'T think homosexuality is really innate and possibly genetic.\n \n \nSee above. Also, very unrealistic. Especially since they would likely not disclose it.\n\n \n The point still stands though--religious usually could care less that it's innate. That's not what religion is addressing. It can't let it's morality rise and fall based on what feels natural to people. If it did, it wouldn't be able to take much of a moral stand on any behavior out there.\n \n \nMy point was(not surprised you ignore it) that gays don't do anything sexually upon the act marrying. So your objection is to what we represent in terms of our homosexuality.\n\n \n No, not really. If I believe stealing is wrong, and someone wants to create a legal recognition of a form of stealing, one reason I would oppose it is because it validates stealing. Has nothing to do with the person trying to do it--it's the action that I oppose. and therefore I'm not going to support something that validate what I consider to be an immoral action.\n \n \nAlso the polygamist [b]DOES have the right to marry the ONE person he loves. \n\n \n That's like saying gays have the right to marry the opposite-sex person he or she loves. Not to mention that you're arbitrarily adding the \"one\" there as a qualifier, when that's the very qualifier the issue of polygamy is about to begin with, which completely begs the question.\n \n \nAnd it's quite possible for the polygamist to fall in love with one person.\n\n \n It's completely possible for a bi-sexual person to fall in love with an opposite-sex person too. Does that mean we shouldn't allow them to marry a same-sex partner if we want? Sorry, analogy still stands!\n \n \nGay marriage is not increased cost to the state, as we are still talking about a couple, not a huge, unlimited group all depending on one patriarch. \n\n \n That's like saying we shouldn't have recognized all the black people and given them civil rights because it would cost the state a lot of $. Poor reason to not give equality in marriage.\n \n But go ahead, keep going down this path. With every post you demonstrate that this \"marriage equality\" thing is really a fake argument on your part. You don't want marriage equality at all when you even go so far as to argue against other forms of marriage besides gay marriage. At least those who want to keep marriage at the status quo as an unchangeable institution are being consistent. You're not.\n \n \nThere are benefits, a ligitimate interest, to promoting monogamy, by laws related to marriage. \n\n \n Such as? What are those benefits? I don't see why that would be the case if they are staying within their marriage in terms of who they are with. If 3 people are disease-free and are married, none of them are going get anything.\n \n \nMore of the \"what if\" game. It's not reality, and not a reason to deny rights to gays.\n\n \n But is reason enough to make marriage an open institution? The point is that this pandora's box you've opened is about marriage. Not just gay marriage. I see no reason to move the boundary a little when you really DON'T want marriage to be an institution of equality. You still want marriage to be a closed institution. All you want is for there to be pears tossed into to the apple barrel using the argument of 'equality', but the only way there's going to be real equality is to just open up the barrel to anything. By making it an apple/pear barrel instead of an apple barrel, it's really an anything-goes barrel at this point. Might as well throw in whatever else.\n \n \nI pointed out precisely how this is a freedom of religion issue, when it comes to polygamy. It's only you who seems to be arguing for polygamy. \n\n \n Only to show you the problems with you arguments. The fact polygamy usually has something to do with religion is really not relevant--it's still a form of marriage.\n \n \nOnce again, show me where polygamists are arguing for \"equality\". \n \n Indeed, I am not arguing for everything to be included. \n\n \n But you might as well, be, that's the point. You're arguing for marriage to be a 'broadenable' institution to begin with. You're wanting to open up marriage. And if you AREN'T, then it's not really equality you're wanting. Why should we move marriage from an institution of inequality to one that's STILL one of inequality? The only difference would be that one single other arrangement gets in. That's silly. Open it up if you really want marriage equality.\n \n \nYour comparisons don't make sense. Actually, we had prayer in school for a long time, without having all sorts of prayers for all types of religions, including cults. Are you arguing for dropping marriage all together, as we did with prayer?\n\n \n Yes!!!! Now we're starting to get somewhere, maybe. I've told you that already, more than once. Marriage needs to be taken out of the government sector altogether and left to the cultural one. Just adding gay marriage is a band-aid. It doesn't make it an institution of equality at all.\n \n \nI think there is a third option with marriage, as has been shown to work, by history. By experience, specifically related to gay marriage at this present time, where gay marriage exists. \n\n \n That doesn't do anything for any other groups that might need benefits too. It's too limited of a solution if giving benefits for a union is going to be an equitable endeavor.\n \n \nI didn't say I was arguing to make it equal in absolute terms to include everything and anything. I said, equal marriage for same-sex couples.\n\n \n Then there's no claim that you can make to your view being any benevolent one further than just a rather limited degree. You don't want marriage opened up to anyone ELSE that might need the benefits. At least those who want to keep marriage unchanged and unchangeable are being consistent. You're not.",

It can't let it's morality rise and fall based on what feels natural to people. If it did, it wouldn't be able to take much of a moral stand on any behavior out there.\n\n \n I'm not making that absolute argument, that nature is always right. But it's not always wrong either.

Not to mention that you're arbitrarily adding the \"one\" there as a qualifier, when that's the very qualifier the issue of polygamy is about to begin with, which completely begs the question.\n\n \n It's easy for any heterosexual, polygamist or not, to choose one person of different sex.\n \n \nIt's completely possible for a bi-sexual person to fall in love with an opposite-sex person too.

Poor reason to not give equality in marriage.\n\n \n No, it's an unlimited contract with polygamy, unlimited potential costs.\n \n \nBut go ahead, keep going down this path.\n\n \n This path is a useless diversion.\n \n \nWith every post you demonstrate that this \"marriage equality\" thing is really a fake argument on your part. You don't want marriage equality at all when you even go so far as to argue against other forms of marriage besides gay marriage. At least those who want to keep marriage at the status quo as an unchangeable institution are being consistent. You're not.\n\n \n Ha, ha! Unchangable you say? Surely you jest! Take a step into reality. Marriage has changed, many times. This is tiresome garbage. Show me real-world evidence that we can't support equality in one area, without extending it elsewhere or everywhere. I've already asked you this. You keep repeating this same false dilemma fallacy, and I'm about done here, pal. If you want to take that as a victory, so be it. \n \n \nBut is reason enough to make marriage an open institution?\n\n \n Show me where I have argued for an \"open institution\". I haven't.\n \n \nThe point is that this pandora's box you've opened is about marriage. Not just gay marriage.\n\n \n EVIDENCE for that pandora's box please. Oh wait, you don't have any.\n \n \nI see no reason to move the boundary a little when you really DON'T want marriage to be an institution of equality. You still want marriage to be a closed institution.\n\n \n Why not? We move boundaries just a little all the time. Doesn't mean we can't have boundaries or equality. I have not argued for equality in absolute terms. Let me ask, if you give Jews the right to marry, are you not extending equality, even if you don't give polygamists the right to marry? Of course that is an extending of equality, an extending of boundaries, whatever you want to call it. We don't have to wait until the polygamy question is answered before we give Jews or others rights. We are still showing equality and justice. We don't have to wait for zero unemployment before we get rid of slavery, or give women the vote. We can still have justice in society, and extend that principle. We can be for these ideas. \n \n \nAll you want is for there to be pears tossed into to the apple barrel using the argument of 'equality', but the only way there's going to be real equality is to just open up the barrel to anything.\n\n \n Give me a real-world piece of evidence that shows we can't extend equality to one group. None of this pandora's box bs.\n \n \nBy making it an apple/pear barrel instead of an apple barrel, it's really an anything-goes barrel at this point. Might as well throw in whatever else.\n\n \n No, it's not. This doesn't mean we are obligated to throw in peaches. It could be an apple/pear barrel.\n \n \nOnly to show you the problems with you arguments. The fact polygamy usually has something to do with religion is really not relevant--it's still a form of marriage.\n\n \n And a religious practice. Can you support religious rights for various groups, without supporting polygamists? You would still be said to be supporting religious rights, even without supporting polygamy. Any other suggestion is a false dilemma, like you are trying to use for another principle, equality and non-discrimination.\n \n \nBut you might as well, be, that's the point. You're arguing for marriage to be a 'broadenable' institution to begin with. You're wanting to open up marriage. And if you AREN'T, then it's not really equality you're wanting. Why should we move marriage from an institution of inequality to one that's STILL one of inequality? The only difference would be that one single other arrangement gets in. That's silly. Open it up if you really want marriage equality.\n\n \n Word games and false dillemma. Yes, I'm close to done with you. It's been opened up without your \"pandora's box\" crapola. So what unique things about gay marriage, would lead to your \"pandora's box\", when this hasn't happened before. No, I don't think I'm gonna get an answer.\n \n \nYes!!!! Now we're starting to get somewhere, maybe. I've told you that already, more than once. Marriage needs to be taken out of the government sector altogether and left to the cultural one. Just adding gay marriage is a band-aid. It doesn't make it an institution of equality at all.\n\n \n Two different issues. You'd need some kind of government civil union for everyone then. And what is it about marriage that would open up this \"pandora's box\" but there wouldn't be the same thing for civil unions? Even if this drastic measure isn't taken, it doesn't prove your so-called pandora's box effect, it doesn't mean we can't give equal rights to one group at a time, and that those are somehow not equal, simply because the argument is not taken to the extreme, by including everything and the kitchen sink.\n \n \nThen there's no claim that you can make to your view being any benevolent one further than just a rather limited degree. You don't want marriage opened up to anyone ELSE that might need the benefits. At least those who want to keep marriage unchanged and unchangeable are being consistent. You're not.\n\n \n This unchanging and unchangable marriage is another myth like your pandora's box. Marriage has not stayed unchanged.

People who believe marriage is important are naturally going to view it in a much broader sense. If someone came along wanting to change the institution of a sweeping concept like, say, \"education\", and try to get everyone to think of education differently to where something that previously had nothing to DO with education should be considered part of a VALID education, you'd probably balk at the idea. That's what's essentially going on here.\n \n \nTwo different issues. You'd need some kind of government civil union for everyone then.\n\n \n Well yeah, you would. That's what some people believe should be the alternative to marriage, because marriage is ALWAYS going to be an non-equitable institution.

The only way benefits can truly be an institution of equality would be to open it up to anyone that comes along wanting it.\n\n \n I don't think so. At any rate, inter-racial couples were told they could marry someone of different race. Was this not making their marriages equal? Was it not an advancement of equal civil rights? You could classify it as letting in just one more \"qualifer\", that's true. But it was also those other things. So are gay equal rights. It's not pointless to advance rights. It doesn't make it pointless if it's done one group at a time. \n \n Jyoshu: Marriage is a right. Are you saying no equal rights currently exist, or have ever existed, because they don't include as you so often put it, \"anyone and everyone that comes along\"? That's putting the issue in absolute all or nothing terms. Is this really the only valid definition you see? By my definition, and by the definition of most reasonable people, we can have equality, in an institution and a right like marriage, based on one issue at a time. I think you may see that too. Your \"pandora's box\" comment in the last reply, was perhaps telling. Are you honestly not using diversion and fear tactics?\n \n \nI'm not saying gay marriage would LEAD to anything. I'm saying that the issue is really just about MARRIAGE to begin with.

It's just a different way of viewing the issue.\n\n \n You're not saying gay marriage would lead to anything? Really? Then why the previous \"pandora's box\" statement?! Open to what? To new groups, definitions, as they've come along? Yes, it hasn't stayed the same. That's the issue we deal with. I'm not denying that. If you are saying it should never be changed at all, how are you going to turn back the clock? Remember, it was changed, to outlaw polygamy. \n \n \nPeople who believe marriage is important are naturally going to view it in a much broader sense.\n\n \n A lot of people believe marriage is important, they just don't share your all or nothing definition of either absolute equality, or else no measure of equality.\n \n \nIf someone came along wanting to change the institution of a sweeping concept like, say, \"education\", and try to get everyone to think of education differently to where something that previously had nothing to DO with education should be considered part of a VALID education, you'd probably balk at the idea.

That's what some people believe should be the alternative to marriage, because marriage is ALWAYS going to be an non-equitable institution.\n\n \n Again, by your all-or-nothing approach to equality, which doesn't consider issues as they come up.\n \n \nAnd frankly, it's a cultural/relgious term that government gives benefits over, and that's going to lead to problematic situations anyway.
