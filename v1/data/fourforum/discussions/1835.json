Have you ever tried to \"build\" a cat? Do you realize how insanely complex that would be? You seem to think that we are the only extremely complex creatures; a cat is also equally complex. It is not a matter of finding a suitable head, body, and tail and the liberally distributing fur over it. That's why cats create cats; it's what they're there for.\n\n Oh how you miss the point so much!!!\n \n \nIve rambled on enough.\n\n Yep! any chance of a sound rebuttal?",

Unbelievable order. You use evolution as a logical argument. Natural selection certainly has logical validity provided your assumptions concerning it are correct. Provided that the rise of humans came as a result of natural selection. It is certainly a logical hypothesis, but this does nothing to make it valid. For logic to be useful it must be based on correct assumptions.\n \n The universe tends towards chaos, not order. Things do not assemble by themselves, they fall apart. The issue really is not one of natural selection, but rather where did the matter come from in the first place. How did the order begin. The point I was making in post time stamped today at 8:30 am is that the idea of the origins of things accidentally devolping by shear luck in a universe that tends toward disorder (corollary to entropy) is as fanciful as believing the bible.\n \n What's more (and this is really the only \"proof\" anyone CAN give) believing the bible and living out of faith in God has made a huge impact on my life.

   "Raisethefist, \n I have kind of answered this before, but let me relay it to you.\n It is simply, Human beings are the most advanced machines ever to walk the earth, we are the absolute hight of technological achievement, we have self-conscience, can talk, hear, listen, laugh, cry we even have the intellectual capability of producing our own technology we are unmatchable by human science, no group of humans can build something as amazing as us.\n Now what you believe is that we came from something less intelligent namely a un-thinking cause, which I find absolutely 100% foolish to believe, it is not logical in the slightest. \n How can an intelligent species not be able to build what an un-intelligence was supposed to create it doesn't make sense.\n\n \n As I have kind of hinted to before, your argument that intelligence has to be created by intelligence does not make sense. It's not logical, since it would mean the creator had to be created in turn and that would say that there is an infinite number of creators. That's the result of your theory.

   "What theory does Genesis 1:1 contain?\n \n Genesis 1\n 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. NASB\n \n \"A theory, in the scientific sense, is \"a coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena\" [Random House American College Dictionary]. The term does not imply tentativeness or lack of certainty. Generally speaking, scientific theories differ from scientific laws only in that laws can be expressed more tersely. Being a theory implies self-consistency, agreement with observations, and usefulness. (Creationism fails to be a theory mainly because of the last point; it makes few or no specific claims about what we would expect to find, so it can't be used for anything. When it does make falsifiable predictions, they prove to be false.) \"[Five Major Misconceptions about Evolution \n Copyright \u00a9 1995-1997 by Mark Isaak]\n\n the phenomenon: the universe exists\n the explanation: God did it\n \n I have seen no theory for this phenomenon that gives a more valid explanation. some give more complex explanations, but they are still no more valid than above\n \n \nEven an evolutionist can plainy see as we as most people that ever opened a scientific text book the bible has zero theories about creation. Why do you insist that it does. Your \"creationist\" theories are man made!\n\n your right! damn these man made theories about how the universe came into existence!! I agree totally!",

   "What are you talking about? The \"theory of evolution\" is not a creature that has intelligence, it is a process.\n\n Which gives it even less chance of building something complex.\n \nDoes \"physics\" require an intelligence in order for gravity to work? It is pretty darn amazing that the interaction of all these different forces work perfectly so our solar system isn't crashing into the sun or spinning out of control, eh? I guess \"physics\" is a genius!\n\n It does require an intelligence actually! But I think we'll stick to the life part for now.\n \nI'm confused. Aren't you arguing that religious doctrine is superior to evolutionary theory?\n\n No I'm arguing that life is the product of intelligent design!\n \n \nSpeciation IS evolution on a smaller scale. \n\n No! genomes are locked and cannot evolve into different ones. Speciation is not evolution.\n \n \nWhy, when even a little knowledge of the subject would answer them for me?\n\n I'm confused. As usual!\n \n \nYet again you show how little you know. The world changes. Creatures change as the most able to survive do survive.\n\n So why did green algae feel the need to change? Please can you refrain from personal comments; it's not good debate.\n \n \nAnd humans have survived just fine with that fraction, haven't we? There were no selective pressures to encourage usage of the rest, most likely.\n\n If there has never been the need for the use of the rest of it then it wouldn't have evolved in the first place. That goes right against the theory you are trying to hold to!\n \n \nEvolution isn't really concerned with intelligence, per se, just with survival. The smartest does not necessarily survive best.\n\n Again, illogical. Humans are destroying the planet that we live on this is very counter productive. Don't you think?\n \n \nWait, how did evolution fail here?\n\n Evolution doesn't explain how knowledge is ingrained into genes. My guess is that it was programmed like a Pentium 4 computer.\n \n \nAnd I thought you knew everything about evolution Or maybe it's just genetics you've failed at. Do you want me to \"demonstrate\" genetics? Hm, I'm not comfortable with people watching that \n\n There is not a single explainable process in evolution, like fish to amphibian.\n \n \nDo you seriously not believe that an ability to learn quickly cannot be passed down to offspring?\n\n You misunderstand me! Intelligence is in the genes but how does knowledge get there?\n \n \n \nWell, I wouldn't call it vauge. It's logical and sound.\n\n Not according to mathematicians.\n \n \nWant something really vauge? Try reading the bible.\n\n I have and it's answered all my questions.\n \nI have yet to find any evidence for gods existance that come even close to being as valid as the scientific theories.\n\n Heres my sound reason.

One cannot resort to evolution as the answer as these are not matters for evolution (they have nothing to do with living creatures necessarily).\n \n To simply claim an unknown force is fine, as long as it is intelligent, creative, and ordered.\n \n Also, How does one exlain via evolution, the maladaptive emotional states such as envy, lust, greed, etc?\n\n \n The biggest mistake most people do when they try to understand the universe is the assumption that it has to make sense. It's not required a intelligent, creative or ordered force to create things. Our universe may be just one of many others laying at a different location in time and/or space with completely different laws of physics and such, thus 'our' laws of physics may just be by 'chance', so to speak. (Also, the quantum and string theories show that the universe doesn't have to be so ordered that we have thought either).\n \n Envy, lust and greed all inspire to betterment of ones state, thus motivation to fight your way to the top of the food chain. Those that did not desire did not get and did not survive. Of course, now when we humans have started living in a society those emotions is getting unnecessary and unpractical to a higher degree.

   "Hello!\n This is my first reply on this forum, became a member today.\n I have participated in other debates online about Creationism vs. Evolution ( although this one is Atheism vs. Creationism), and they are all the same.\n I think the question should be, \"Do you believe in God\"?, because those who do tend to go along with creationism, while those who don't, lean towards evolution.\n \n There is no \"proof\" to convince one to abandon his current belief for the other. The only purpose these debates serve is to sway the undecided to one side or the other. imo.\n \n I have read this thread, and have a couple of questions for the evolutionists.\n About species evolution, If humans evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys here?\n If we were born from slime, why are there still not humans being created this same way?\n Regarding the survival of the fittest, humans seem to be exempt from this process. We have always cared for the weakest members of our society, not destroyed them. \n Is compassion a weakness of the human race, or, it's greatest strength?\n \n Sandy emoticon_xbye\n\n \n I don't wanna nit pick. You make points that sound good, but only go against \"pop culture\" evolution the kind you see on TV shows or out dated abbreviated dribble compressed into elementary school text books. Real scientists don't believe in your concept of evolution.\n \n Real creation vs. evolution debate I feel are limited to a literal 6 days vs. billions of years. Your first paragraph was dead on. \n \n BTW guys don't bash her she is sincere blame the schools and the media (X-men/Star Trek) they taught a lot of the misconceptions because the teachers were creationist that didn't wanna teach it anyway and didn't have evolution explained to them before they taught it, or artist exploiting the wild implications of evolution to make a buck.\n \n The thing is evolution is an unfounded theory and seriously flawed. Not because the evidence is not here, but because it makes assumptions about the universe that may not be true. Evolution needs certain things to be true to work. Until you can define the nature of the fabric of the universe the model of evolution is like a well made boat in a dry lake bed. An example is if everything was predetermined by an initial state in the \"big bang\" then there is no evolution.",

A major portion of the world are Catholic- they believe in God and evolution. Muslims as well. And so on.\n \n \nAbout species evolution, If humans evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys here?\n\n Humans didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys and other primates share an ancestor. Even if they did, species can (and often do) break up into groups where some groups evolve more rapidly or change more extremely than others. A species doesn't have to die out for some of them to evolve.\n \n There is a lot of information on evolution on the Talk.Origins website.\n \n \nIf we were born from slime, why are there still not humans being created this same way?\n\n We aren't born from slime, and no humans have even been created fully-grown from slime. Creatures have evolved from \"slime\" to become other creatures, who became other creatures, etc., until you got to mammals and primates and humans. \n \n \n Regarding the survival of the fittest, humans seem to be exempt from this process. We have always cared for the weakest members of our society, not destroyed them.\n\n Fittest doesn't mean strongest. It means \"most fitting\", in other words, \"most well-adapted\". Therefore, if being a big and strong creature is a good adaptation in your environment, being big and strong is \"fitting\". Conversely, if being small and quick is adaptive, than that is fitting. This is where ecological \"niches\" come into it. \n \n The giraffe is a good example. The giraffe-ancestors with the longest necks always got the most food because noone else around was that tall. So, the longest-necked giraffe-ancestors lived longer, were healthier, and reproduced more. As time went on, the long-necked giraffe-ancestors outnumbered their shorter-necked peers, and this trend continued. A giraffe's neck at this point is disproportionately long and thin- this could be seen as a weakness (and would be in some environments). However, the circumstances of the giraffe-ancestors were such that having an extremely long neck was advantageous, so that characteristic has survived.",

It is a guess that declares certain unknowns as true. There are atheists that feel this way too, and don't believe in creation or evolution. They accept you don't have to make up a story to explain every thing you don't know and move on.\n \n Matching the fossil record to evolution is not the same as measuring the speed of light in a vacuum, or acceleration due to gravity.\n \n We are born from slime have you ever seen a baby born :p\n \n The giraffe is a bad example.

We want justice in the end; we hate having to face that life is not fair. People don't seem to realize this vital fact: LIFE IS NOT FAIR. But with God, life gets a whole lot better, it seems. There is some big loving entity in the sky that loves us unconditionally and will give us everlasting life for believing him. And for all of the people who wronged us, well, they're going to hell. (Unless of course, they accepted Jesus into their hearts as well. But we won't care about the wrongs that they have done us in the previous life; we're in heaven together!)

It IS a logical fallacy to ask that question. emoreno simply asks something that is nonsense. It is like asking \"why did the bowling ball floss with brocolli?\" The question makes no sense. One assumes things not in evidence. Is it within the nature of bowling balls to floss at all, let alone with brocolli? NO of course not. It is also a logical falacy as there is the begged question. That is precisely what I was pointing out. \n \n emoreno, if you asked a logical question, I would have given a logical answer. If you will note, I have over 1800 posts on this board, and while I occasionally avoid hard questions for the sake of debate, it is not my habit. You will find many who have asked LEGITIMATE questions that are hard to answer and I have given the answer \"I don't know\" I have also said, \"this is my opinion.\" \n \n You accuse me of something I do not do on a regular basis and avoid the answer that you should be giving which is to show how your question is logical. You, however, do have a history on this board of avoiding logical questions as you do not understand logic and instead answer out of your lack of knowledge and understanding and out of your obvious bias. This weakens your position greatly in the argument. Be ready to accept that your arguments are not logical and learn how to be logical. If you have legitimate questions I would be happy to answer.\n \n ccr: I appreciate your rewording of the question. However, you still do not avoid the begged question on the existence of God. To answer either question one must still assume the existence of God. If you assume the existence of someone all powerful and omniscient etc. then you give up the right to define his attributes as you (and I ) are finite while he is infinite. If however you assume he does not exist then the question is nonsense and irrelevant. \n \n If we assume that God exists, then the question is, rightly, \"what is the nature of God?\" If we are looking at what it means to be all powerful, then that would mean that He can do anything within his nature. Just as a anyone can do what is within their nature. neither you nor I can take on the nature of a squirrel. No matter how hard we try we cannot BE a squirrel. We can immitate one but cannot BE one. God cannot be anything other than God. This does not mean he is not all powerful. It only means that God is the definer of what it means to be all powerful.\n \n That is the best I can do for now, without an all out course in logic. There are many websites out there discussing logical fallacies and how to recognize them.\n \n Emoreno, I did not mean to call you childish. Although you are quite sensitive. I simply stated that your question falls in the logical reasoning of a child. You have accepted something that is hogwash, without truly examining its logical validity yourself.",

My question now has a bit more relevance, I would think. So can this omnipotent being create/do something that is unable to be done or completed? It's not as nonsensical as it sounds.",

   "First and foremost, allow me to say that there was a hint of sarcasm in that last post of mine, which you may not have detected. Also, do not try to intimidate me with your 1800 posts. I'm very happy for you that you have put out 1800 posts.\n Anyway, allow me to explain: When one is dealing with religion, and arguments for/against it, logic flies out of the window. The thought that free will exists with an omnipotent being is completely illogical in itself. That omnipotent being would know what we were going to do already; thus eliminating the choice. My question now has a bit more relevance, I would think. So can this omnipotent being create/do something that is unable to be done or completed? It's not as nonsensical as it sounds.\n\n \n First, let me apologize for the tardiness of this post. \n \n second, let me point out that your statement that logic flies out the window is ludricous. You do not back it up with any evidence. God is ultimately logical. Your question continues to be illogical. I have also already answered it. as for my comment on 1800 posts it was simply to point out that I do NOT, as you accused me, avoid hard questions. You said, \"Also, is it nonsense simply because you know what the answer's implications are and just can't face up to them or is it because you simply don't want to look at the truth? \"\n \n I don't actually think this is sarcastic. You were trying to make an attack by claiming that I avoid hared questions because of the implications. Not only did I not avoid it, I also pointed out the illogic of your statement and therefore the illegitimacy of the argument.\n \n This is a debate forum. If we cannot use logic to debate the topic then in that case allow me to say that you are wrong because broccoli is red. \n \n Logic is the only basis upon which one CAN argue, otherwise there is no common ground for discussion and everything becomes moot including this board. I think the \"admin\" may not like that thought emoticon_smile \n \n You continue to support an illogical question by saying that we cannot debate the question with logic. This is a non argument.",

But, as far as science goes, it's still a niche market, mainly because it's so interdisciplinary and just plain hard. Actually, scientists are not looking to the past, but the future. It's been dubbed \"Artificial Life.\" Usually for physical artificial life, there is some sort of self-replicating membrane system (as in cells), some sort of \"metabolism\" that keeps going as long as it's \"fed\", and some sort of \"genes\" where some sort of information is conserved in order to maximize \"survival.\" \n \n http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=4&tid=41\n http://www.alcyone.com/max/links/alife.html\n http://www.alife9.org/\n \n But, usually when any insight into abiogenesis comes out, it's from some other study that had no intentions with regard to spontaneous life. I'm talking about things like the origin of homochirality (all one handed) in sugars and amino acids. Sometimes someone is studying something about aa's and realizes a natural mechanism for enatiomerically enriching (making more of one handedness) amino acids.\n \n \none of the main reasons that creationist group the 3 theories together is because together they collectively replace the explanation for existence that genesis provides. and for scientists to subscribe to 1 or 2 of the theories without subscribing to all 3 is extremely rare.\n\n \n I don't know. I don't know how many scietists subscribe to what theory. If a biologist reads something in Scientific American (just a mag) that talks about BBT, they don't usually say \"why yes, they are absolutely right!\" they don't know what they are talking about because they probably don't know enough physics to make that claim. If he were shown the paper from Physical Review (a real journal) they probably won't understand it entirely. \n \n If some random scientist believes what some other scietist in another field tells him about that field, he might be inclined to believe him. It is of little consequence whether he believes it or not and the decision to believe has nothing to do with genesis.\n \n \nevolution itself is observable and undeniable. genetic variation does arise in species from generation to generation. macro-evolution is an extension of this, where given enough time and generations, one type of organism can evolve into another kind entirely. those that accept macro-evolution usually believe that the living organisms that we see today statred off as simple unicellular primative lifeforms, started of as chemical reactions that naturally fused into more complex molecules. this is the basis of abiogenesis. and even before abiogenesis was the universe itself, that erupted into existence and spewed out matter into space, forming plantary systems everywhere, many with conditions suitable for abiogenesis\n \n the 3 theories, BBT, abiogenesis and macro evolution, though considered separated sciences, are related in that together they form a theory that answers \"how come existence\"\n \n the alternative, of course, is \"poof!

   "i believe this deserves my two cents (now ask yourself if thats an insult or a compliment):\n \n creationism is ********. heres why:\n \n 1) string theory. mathematically proven by the current einsteins all over: basically it states that there is a series oc paralell planes or *something* (no idea what) that, where they collide, they form new universes, each with their own laws: imagine an entire planet as an ocean, then have another ocean, facing down, hovering right above it: where the waves collide, you get a universe. so in that sense, you probably won't like it because besides taking away your source of superiourity (by you i mean 'anyone religious', and by source of superiourity i mean the god who grants your whimsical prayers) and also it makes us seem so much smaller when we think about it.\n \n 2) because evolution was bound to happen *SOMEWHERE*. i don't care how low the chances are for it, the chances that there is a planet capable of supporting life- as we know it- was bound to happen. it was one in 900 billion, you say? good job! possibly even correct! now start counting the stars. which one do you think supports life? why, this one!\n \n point (3a) assumes that there IS a god. and its still pro-evolution. essentially, i'm going to make the point that, like anywhere else in the bible, maybe genesis has some inacuracies (if you think the bible is absolute, compare the last words of jesus in the gospel). could it have originally been 'millenia' instead of days? i think so- especially since it would have been a much larger time, and we even today don't have a word commonly used to describe *millions* or *billions* of years. i consider that, in the odd chance it happens to be correct (in which case i still refuse to worship god, but this isn't the place for that argument), one of those things 'lost in translation'.\n \n point (3b)- also assuming there is a god who created this world- what input did he ask from you? why, none! absolutely ****ing nothing was decreed by man EXCEPT the names of the animals, plants, and all other living things. thats the only input adam had! god didn't say 'how long should i take to make this place?' or 'do you think maybe i should just give it a set of rules and see what happens?' as far as you know (and further than i honestly can claim to care) this is like god's version of solitaire. some games last longer than others, he could have created universes and civilizations and all sorts of things and scrapped them in the middle- it certainly seems to have happened to us.",

You forget also that the theories (theories) which you quote also have base assumptions forwhich there is no proof. Particularly string theory. The path does not prove it's existence, it merely proves the possibility. Possibility because it is based on assumptions that cannot be proven. Namely the existence of those infinite planes that converge. There is no proof of their existences.\n \n Evolution violates the laws of thermodynamics. And your comments about the probablity that it would happen because of the immensity of the universe are uneducated. Have you taken what it takes to make evolution happen and calculated the probablity based on the size of the universe. I did in my junior physics class in college. Quite interesting. Even accounting for the enormity of the universe the probablity of evoultion is still below 50%. I cannot remember how far but it was somwhere around a 20% chance.\n \n EF",

I cannot remember how far but it was somwhere around a 20% chance.\n \n EF\n\n \n Well, you are very incorrect when you say that Evolution violates the law of thermodynamics. # The second law of thermodynamics says no such thing. It says heat will not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a warmer one, or equivalently, that total entropy (a measure of useful energy) in a closed system will not decrease. This doesn't prevent increasing order because\n \n * the earth is not a closed system; sunlight (with low entropy) shines on it and heat (with higher entropy) radiates off. This flow of energy, and the change in entropy which accompanies it, can and will power local decreases in entropy on earth.\n * entropy is not the same as disorder. Sometimes the two correspond, but sometimes order increases as entropy increases. [Aranda-Espinoza et al. 1999; Kestenbaum 1998] Entropy can even be used to produce order, such as in the sorting of molecules by size [Han and Craighead 2000].\n * even in a closed system, pockets of lower entropy can form if they are offset by increased entropy elsewhere in the system. \n \n In short, order from disorder happens on earth all the time.\n \n \n As for the probablities of evolution... well, when you make numbers up out of thin air, you can make the probablity anything you want. \n \n The people who give 'probablity' of abiogenesis, or evolution only give numbers that they make up. There is no support for the numbers by which they do their calculation from.",
