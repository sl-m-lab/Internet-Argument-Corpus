While there are some people in Japan who have embraced outsider ideas, there are those still in Japan who wish to be \"their own little Island.\" If you have ever heard or read about the speeches of Mayor Takashi Onoda (of Tokyo) you'd realize there is a lot hatred towards foreigners by some in Japan. Also, in Japan racism is not like in the US (here racists would probably kill, beat, etc do things to people physically). In Japan racism is shown by ignoring you. The Japanese culture is not very \"confrontational\" if you know what I mean. Ever noticed the \"Japanese only signs\" in Japan? From where or what do you think this stems out from? Some apologetics say \"it's the foreigners faults for being so inconsiderate, etc, etc\" I say that's bs. If they had any kind of sense they would realize not all foreigners are like that. Hell even the UN has had an issue with Japan regarding discrimination against foreigners. What's even more funny is some of these people want to make a profit in foreign markets, yet do not want to become part of the international community for fear they will lose their identity. We all know that's bs, but they seem to take it as a \"disease\" of some sorts. They want to have their cake and eat it too! It ain't going to happen in a world like today. Fortunately, there are some people in Japan who haven't taken that stance and are instead choosing to become part of the international community. Japan still has a way to go, IMHO.",
