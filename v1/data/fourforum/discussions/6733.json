   "At the beginning of October I read a very interesting article, published in the old \"New Statesman\" magazine in London < htpp://newstatesman.com/Economy/200510030021 <. Its author, Jo Durden-Smith, has openly showed (or, maybe, babbled out casually) that most videos and CDs with propaganda materials \"are being smuggled into Byelorussia from Poland\". It becomes clear all this happens at witting of Polish government officials. And it would be good if dozens of not only Polish dubbing studios don't use these channels along with special hardware, delivered to Poland from USA and GB, for pirate copying. But Mr. Durden-Smith prefers to keep it quiet. Why? It's very strange that he's said nothing about such well-known fact as sudden increase of just Polish pirated video and audio production that police of many European countries have pointed out recently.",
