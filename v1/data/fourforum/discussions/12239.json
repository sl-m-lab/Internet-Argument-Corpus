Not that this would make a supernatural explanation scientific, mind you. But it doesn't necessarily have to be hostile to the endeavor of natural explanation.\n\n \n Here's some evidence and statistics to go along with his flat assertions. An exerpt:\n 1. Spontaneous Generation \n \n How does the evolutionist explain the existence of that first one-celled animal from which all life forms supposedly evolved? For many years the medieval idea of spontaneous generation was the accepted explanation. According to Webster, spontaneous generation is \"the generation of living from nonliving matter ... [it is taken] from the belief, now abandoned, that organisms found in putrid organic matter arose spontaneously from it.\" \n Simply stated, this means that under the proper conditions of temperature, time, place, etc., decaying matter simply turns into organic life. This simplistic idea dominated scientific thinking until 1846, when Louis Pasteur completely shattered the theory by his experiments. He exposed the whole concept as utter foolishness. Under controlled laboratory conditions, in a semi-vacuum, no organic life ever emerged from decaying, nonliving matter. Reluctantly it was abandoned as a valid scientific issue. Today no reputable scientist tries to defend it on a demonstrable basis. That is why Webster says it is \"now abandoned.\" It never has been and never can be demonstrated in the test tube. No present process is observed that could support the idea of spontaneous generation. Obviously, if spontaneous generation actually did take place in the distant past to produce the first spark of life, it must be assumed that the laws that govern life had to be completely different from what they are now. But wait a minute! This won't work either, because the whole evolutionary theory rests upon the assumption that conditions on the earth have remained uniform throughout the ages. \n Do you begin to see the dilemma of the evolutionists in explaining that first amoeba, or monad, or whatever formed the first cell of life? If it sprang up spontaneously from no previous life, it contradicts a basic law of nature that forms the foundation of the entire theory. Yet, without believing in spontane\u00acous generation, the evolutionist would have to acknowledge something other than natural forces at work-in other words, God. How do they get around this dilemma? \n Dr. George Wald, Nobel Prize winner of Harvard University, states it as cryptically and honestly as an evolutionist can: \n \"One has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede that the spontaneous generation of a living organism is impossible. Yet here we are-as a result, I believe, of spontaneous generation.\" Scientific American, August 1954.\n \n That statement by Dr. Wald demonstrates a much greater faith than a religious creationist can muster. Notice that the great evolutionary scientist says it could not have happened. It was impossible. Yet he believes it did happen. What can we say to that kind of faith? At least the creationist believes that God was able to speak life into existence. His is not a blind faith in something that he concedes to be impossible. \n So here we are, face to face with the first contradiction of evolution with a basic law of science. In order to sustain his humanistic explanation of the origin of life, he must accept the exploded, unscientific theory of spontaneous generation. And the big question is this: Why is he so violently opposed to the spontaneous generation spoken of in the Bible? A miracle of creation is required in either case. Either God did it by divine fiat, or blind, unintelligent nature produced Wald's impossible act. Let any reasonable mind contemplate the alternatives for a moment. Doesn't it take more faith to believe that chance could produce life than it does to believe infinite intelligence could produce it?\n Why did Dr. Wald say that it was impossible for life to result from spontaneous generation? That was not an easy concession for a confirmed evolutionist to make. His exhaustive search for a scientific explanation ended in failure, as it has for all other evolutionary scientists, and he had the courage to admit it. But he also had an incredible faith to believe in it even though it was a scientific impossibility. A Christian who confessed to such a faith would be labeled as naive and gullible. What a difference the cloak of higher education makes upon our easily impressed minds! How much simpler and sweeter the faith that accepts the inspired account: \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth\" (Genesis 1:1). \n \n \n 2. Chance Life-A Ridiculous Improbability \n \n What would be involved in the accidental development of a single living cell? The fact is that the most elementary form of life is more complicated than any man-made thing on earth. The entire complex of New York City is less complicated than the makeup of the simplest microscopic cell. It is more than ridiculous to talk about its chance production. Scientists themselves assure us that the structure of a single cell is unbelievably intricate. The chance for a proper combination of molecules into amino acids, and then into proteins with the properties of life is entirely unrealistic. American Scientist magazine made this admission in January of 1955: \n \"From the probability standpoint, the ordering of the present environment into a single amino acid molecule would be utterly improbable in all the time and space available for the origin of terrestrial life. \"\n A Swiss mathematician, Charles Eugene Guye, actually computes the odds against such an occurrence at only one chance in 10(160). That means 10 multiplied by itself 160 times, a number too large even to articulate. Another scientist expressed it this way: \n \"The amount of matter to be shaken together to produce a single molecule of \n protein would be millions of times greater than that in the whole universe. For it to occur on earth alone would require many, almost endless, billions of years\" (The Evidence of God in an Expanding Universe, p. 23). \n How can we explain the naive insistence of evolutionists to believe something so extremely out of character for their scientific background? And how can we harmonize the normally broad-minded tolerance of the educated, with the narrow bigotry exhibited by many evolutionary scientists in trying to suppress opposing points of view? The obvious explanation would seem to be rooted in the desperation of such evolutionists to retain their reputation as the sole dispensers of dogmatic truth. To acknowledge a superior wisdom has been too long cultivated by the evolutionist community. They have repeated their assumptions for so long in support of their theories that they have started accepting them as facts. No one objects to their assuming whatever they want to assume, but to assume happenings that go contrary to all scientific evidence and still call it science is being dishonest.

   "The future of this argument is rather predictable:\n \n As humans come closer to taking organic matter and producing living organic matter from it, it can be said that it is because the Bible says that God made us in his image. This will, at least, be the argument IDers will take. This will be the argument I will take as well, but it will be seen as logical to IDers and irrational to those who do not believe in intelligent design. This is understandable and neither side would have to be too whacko to believe either opinion.\n \n The one outstanding difference of IDers and those that would rather believe in chance is that God (the Christian god at least, note the capital \"G\") can pull something out of nothing whereas humans are limited that nothing can be gained or taken away and that matter can only be made into something else whilst retaining the same amount of energy/mass or expending energy/mass into another form that does not make up part of the end result during the process.\n \n When humans can pull something from nothing, then I believe this debate will have a close. Unfortunately, just because we cannot prove it possible does not mean it is impossible and therefore IDers can never be proven 100% correct. On the other hand, if the laws of physics are re-written as we know it and something coming from nothing is within the laws that govern this universe, then IDers may have to challenge their beliefs slightly. However, this could also be used as support for the human race being made in the image of God. (As an aside, I must warn all fellow Christian creationists to never believe we have the power of God even if we ever accomplish this feat. A famous angel of worship proclaimed that, and I don't think he's too happy of a camper these days.)\n \n I think probably one of the firmest truths in my mind that supports Intelligent Design is that I do not believe in Chaos. Einstein believed that if you knew how every factor would play out as governed by the laws of physics, that you could predict the end result of any process. An example would be that a throw of the dice seems random, but if you know how the dice will be released and what that vector and momentum will land as while compensating for air resistance, gravity, friction of the landing surface, amount of rebound the dice will incur on their landing, and so an and so forth, that you will can accurately predict what they will land on every single time. In this way, random events are not random as they follow laws that are set in stone. Einstein unfortunately never completed his proof or his \"theory of everything\", but the basic idea is there and I would hope that many of you would agree that this seems logical.\n \n Basically, this is a long way of saying that nothing can ever be proved impossible whether it's ID or Evolution; sure, you can't turn an apple into an orange by frying an apple, but that isn't to say that that's the only way it could be done. This debate will never end, and every side will see the other side's argument as blind and based off of faith.\n \n Take away from this debate one truth: There is only one thing that can be proved impossible- proving impossibility.\n \n \n \"Science without religion is crippled, religion without science is blind.\" \n Albert Einstein \n \n \"Science gives man knowledge which is power; Religion gives man wisdom which is control.\"\n Martin Luther King, Jr",

It is a skill that can only be cultivated independent of sound logic by deception though.\n \n I remember two facts, first that someones perception of you is often colored by their evaluation of your beliefs in comparison to their own.\n \n Have you watched the Alan Keys vs Obama debates?

This commitment carries with it unwavering support for academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas. It also demands the utmost respect for the scientific method, integrity in the conduct of research, and recognition that the validity of any scientific model comes only as a result of rational hypothesis testing, sound experimentation, and findings that can be replicated by others.\n \n The department faculty, then, are unequivocal in their support of evolutionary theory, which has its roots in the seminal work of Charles Darwin and has been supported by findings accumulated over 140 years. The sole dissenter from this position, Prof. Michael Behe, is a well-known proponent of \"intelligent design.\" While we respect Prof. Behe's right to express his views, they are his alone and are in no way endorsed by the department.

   "This is what Databed's article said: \"This is testable, every human on the planet has the same ERV's\"\n \n So we all share them. But wait, I don't think we share parents, or grandparents, or great grandparents, I doubt even great great great great great great grandparents (unless you come from the Irish family of O'Hagans). So this invariably means that they shared all the exact same ones as well. This also means that no new ERVs have come into existence in the past few hundred years. So how exactly did they prove that ERVs are actually created by the process they described? They certainly could not have observed it.\n \n So the \"ERVs\" may just well be a part of DNA without a known purpose. Scientists, desperate for anything that would seem to support their theories, created this hypothosis with the knowledge that they would not be questioned.\n\n \n 1. So we should regard all paternity testing as bogus, and never use DNA in criminal trials. Because per your own reasoning, similarity -- even identity -- does not indicate common descent.\n \n 2. You could not have observed divine creation. In fact, you could not even have observed the composition of the book of Genesis. Per your own reasoning, I can see no cause to take your claims about the world's origins at all seriously.\n \n Did it ever occur to you that maybe it's \"your own reasoning\" that is the problem?",

   "The problem with Behe's \"irreducible complexity\" isn't the definition of the term, per se. There are indeed plenty of complex biological systems that will fail if you take away even a single part. But I'd just call that \"breakable complexity.\"\n \n The problem is when he says that such systems can't develop through a succession of modifications, which is why he describes them as \"irreducibly\" complex, I suppose.

   "[An] inherent lack of selection pressure... is the reason IC cannot be evolved.\n\n \n I would like an explanation of this statement.\n \n I guess it has something to do with this line of reasoning from Post #269:\n \n < \"You must integrate the concept of selection pressure with time, this is the key to understanding IC. Selection pressure exists only for existing mutations. What selection pressure for any structure in say I secretory system for a flagellum can there be?\"\n \n Okay, first things first. I've noticed you pointing out logical fallacies yourself. So certainly you must realize that all this is, is an argument from incredulity. The fact that you cannot conceive such a selection pressure, does not mean that there isn't one, or that somebody else can't conceive of it perfectly well.\n \n Meanwhile, here's a stab at answering the question, in a way that even integrates time.\n \n Suppose we have a bacterium that uses a type I secretory system to attack its prey. But over time, that prey evolves a defense against the secretory system. (It's not hard to imagine that there would be pretty high selection pressure to do so.) Fortunately, this isn't the only way that the bacterium can absorb nutrients. Its numbers drop hugely, maybe it nearly gets wiped out by its former prey's new and effective defense. But because it wasn't completely specialized, it endures. It just no longer uses that secretory system; it's a vestigial organelle.\n \n Over time, the parts of the genome that encode for this organelle undergo huge numbers of mutations. Some of these mutations cause serious problems for their possessors, who go extinct. Most, however, are selectively neutral: they don't affect the way the bacterium survives and reproduces. Some of these neutral mutations may not code at all; some may code for insignificant modifications to the vestigial secretory system.\n \n Eventually, however, a fortunate strain of the baceterium undergoes a mutation that does code for the organelle, and yields a significant modification -- a modification that for a change has a positive impact on survival and reproduction. The former secretory system lengthens and can provide locomotion. It's rudimentary at first, but it does enable the bacterium to find its food and avoid its predators more effectively.

   "The problem with Behe's \"irreducible complexity\" isn't the definition of the term, per se. There are indeed plenty of complex biological systems that will fail if you take away even a single part. But I'd just call that \"breakable complexity.\"\n \n The problem is when he says that such systems can't develop through a succession of modifications, which is why he describes them as \"irreducibly\" complex, I suppose. If you take a system that already exists, and remove one of its parts, yes, it will likely not function -- now, or in the future. But why does that fact entail that, in the past, the system couldn't have had a lesser degree of the same function, or a different funciton entirely, or even no function at all? Seems a leap of logic to me.\n\n Excellent, that is the first mistake made about IC.\n \n It is not a statement about the past or future, or even the present.\n \n It is an analysis of a function.\n \n Again I integrated the temporal nature of functions with IC when I invented and expanded the concept of HIC.\n \n I would guess that 90%+ of current system are HIC, at some point all systems probably were.\n \n Systems can change from IC to HIC and vice versa.\n \n HIC = Hybrid Irreducibly complex (not original but who cares).\n \n It means that parts of the system are necessary for function and other parts aren't.\n \n (Yes it is that simple and that clear)\n \n By definition I argued that all systems are either HIC or pure IC, both contain an IC system so this feeling that Behe gives in his book like he found a special example or something is incorrect.\n \n All systems have necessary components.\n \n The eye is HIC, that means it has components that are not necessary.\n \n The proposed evolution of the eye is also what I called IC improvement. IC improvements were a theoretical possibility proved by peeling a while back, he was attempting to show that I shouldn't differentiate between improvement and novelty by proving improvement can fail the guided mutation test; it did not have the effect on me that he was hoping for.\n \n \nIf I remove the wing rivets from an airplane, it won't fly. It does not follow that the airplane wasn't constructed over time, according to a step-by-step process.\n\n I like analogies but you must be clear what parts of the analogy are related, planes are constructed by people with designs.\n \n If a plane needed to fly to have selection pressure for better flying than missing rivets would remove that selection pressure as a possibility.\n \n \nAs far as I can tell, this is exactly what Behe is saying about biological systems (at least at the level of biochemistry): because they're breakable now, they couldn't have evolved before.\n\n They have always been breakable, and the link between IC and non-evolvability is integrating selection pressure over time.\n \n \nI would like an explanation of this statement.\n\n Before the system is operational by definition there can be no selection pressure for that function.\n \n Any change is then by definition random with respect to that function.\n \n Since there selection for a non-existent function or improvement there is no accumulation of mutations beneficial to that function and that means there is no gradual selected change to create it. With respect to natural selection it does not exist.\n \n Claiming that evolution can produce it is claiming that selection events will occur based on future benefit; thereby attributing planning (an intelligence) to a naturalistic process which cannot be there.\n \n \nOkay, first things first. I've noticed you pointing out logical fallacies yourself. So certainly you must realize that all this is, is an argument from incredulity. The fact that you cannot conceive such a selection pressure, does not mean that there isn't one, or that somebody else can't conceive of it perfectly well.\n\n The fact that such a selection pressure cannot exist except by chance is not a statement about my imagination.\n \n If my arguments are sound there is no one on earth who can think of a selection pressure for a non-existent system. The closest (my arguments predict) they will come is co-option.\n \n \nMeanwhile, here's a stab at answering the question, in a way that even integrates time.\n \n Suppose we have a bacterium that uses a type I secretory system to attack its prey. But over time, that prey evolves a defense against the secretory system. (It's not hard to imagine that there would be pretty high selection pressure to do so.) Fortunately, this isn't the only way that the bacterium can absorb nutrients. Its numbers drop hugely, maybe it nearly gets wiped out by its former prey's new and effective defense. But because it wasn't completely specialized, it endures. It just no longer uses that secretory system; it's a vestigial organelle.\n \n Over time, the parts of the genome that encode for this organelle undergo huge numbers of mutations. Some of these mutations cause serious problems for their possessors, who go extinct. Most, however, are selectively neutral: they don't affect the way the bacterium survives and reproduces. Some of these neutral mutations may not code at all; some may code for insignificant modifications to the vestigial secretory system.\n\n I would like to point out that constructing useless machines will be slightly negative in selection pressure but that is not relevant to what you are about to say I am sure.\n \n \nEventually, however, a fortunate strain of the baceterium undergoes a mutation that does code for the organelle, and yields a significant modification -- a modification that for a change has a positive impact on survival and reproduction. The former secretory system lengthens and can provide locomotion.\n\n This change is the issue at hand, it is well known to me and I admit that there is no law preventing any single mutation from doing anything.\n \n My conclusions are about what evolution can produce.\n \n It would be wrong to say evolution can produce a mutation, evolution operates on mutations.\n \n Similarly it is incorrect to say evolution can produce a change or a new system which is claimed to be a lucky hit.\n \n This genetic change will fail the guided mutation test, meaning the product is an IC change.\n \n Now the reason Behe choose the most complicated machines he could find is revealed, he wanted to use the practical impossibility of spontaneous generation to prove ID.\n \n \nIt's rudimentary at first, but it does enable the bacterium to find its food and avoid its predators more effectively. There is therefore a selection pressure toward lengthening of the organelle. Further mutation, and even just ordinary variation subject to selection, pushes the organelle to lengthen over many generations. And eventually, the bacterium has developed something that we would recognize as a flagellum.\n\n You'll forgive me for not responding to this part it is merely wrapping up the evolutionary story.\n \n \nDoes it work as a secretory system any longer? Nope. It broke. But it works just fine as a flagellum. Are there ways it could fail to work as a flagellum? Absolutely. It could break. But this certainly doesn't imply that it didn't evolve. And that's why I think \"irreducible complexity\" is a wrong-headed notion.\n\n It does imply.\n \n \nNow: This is a just-so story, and I make no claim about it being an accurate account of the actual evolution of anything.\n\n You may come to realize some day that the same could be said for just about every evolutionary story, what makes some look elegant or plausible is good poetics and a healthy imagination.\n \n \nBut keep in mind, that's not what has to be done in order to show why \"irreducible complexity\" fails. IC makes claims about what is possible and impossible. This is a conceptual rather than an empirical matter.\n\n Precisely.\n \n \nIs my little tale above a piece of actual natural history? I have no idea, and in truth, I rather doubt it. But is it possible? I believe so, and I wouldn't be surprised if an actual evolutionary sequence resembled it.\n\n Again you are correct, it is possible.\n \n Your story in fact did not contain anything with which IC would take offense.\n \n \nComplexity, so far as I can see, is always reducible back through time. So there's no reason why it can't evolve.\n\n Depends on the building block size you consider sufficient.\n \n One could apply the same concept as homology with secretory system to say that since proteins existed before flagella, flagella are not IC.\n \n This not being the same sense of the word reducible as is used in the term IC.\n \n \nBy the by, I should add that if you want evidence for why \"irreducible complexity\" doesn't work, take a look at Chapter 5 of Dawkins' The Greatest Show on Earth. In particular, focus on the work of Richard Lenski, discussed by Dawkins on pp. 116-133.\n\n Is it a good book?\n \n \nOne of the most interesting results involved E. coli evolving to metabolize citrate in the presence of oxygen -- but only after two mutations had occurred, and in a specific order. Despite the improbability of such an event, it did happen, and with highly beneficial effects for the E. coli lineage in which it did.\n \n The first mutation is completely useless without the second. Take the second away, and you've got nothing. According to Behe, that's irreducible complexity, so it couldn't have evolved. But evolve it did.\n\n Actually it spontaneously formed, Behe does not claim this cannot happen and has several examples of it in the edge of evolution to illustrate his point about the consequences of abandoning gradual selection.\n \n \nOne last comment on \"irreducible complexity\" and then I'm done with it.\n \n True. But why must the modern and ancestral systems have the same selection pressure in order for the former to evolve from the latter?\n\n If they are different then the accumulation of beneficial changes will be different.\n \n i.e. what makes a good door may not make a good window, if it does it's by chance.\n \n \nThere is no such requirement!!! In fact, a modern system could evolve from an ancestral system precisely because the selection pressures change!\n\n Provided the ancestral system begins to function differently bringing about a change in selection pressures, again this is skipping over the event in question.\n \n \nyour idea of HIC is quite silly. \n\n Well don't think I will stop using it for that reason :p\n \n \ni suppose you mean if you remove some parts of the eye, like the retina, the eye will not function which is true. however, the retina was the first to evolve and is thus a fundamental part of the eye.\n\n There you go, you understand silly concepts great.\n \n \nthats like saying if you remove the stem from a flower it will not function like a flower. thats also true because the stem grows first.\n\n and?\n \n \nif you remove the flower on some plants, the stem and plant will still survive and sometimes produce another flower. you cannot remove the part that first evolved because it is necessary for function. in fact, in the case of the eye, you can even demote the retina to regular skin cells with adapted, upgraded light sensitivity. every skin cell has a certain degree of light sensitivity. you cannot remove the cell membrane from the flagellum. this is not HIC, its evolution basics.\n\n You may call it what you wish, I have long known that any attempt at arguing against something will require the use of it's own concepts as IC does evolution.\n \n \nthe fact of the matter is if you removed every part of your eye except the retina, without ruining it, you will have functionality, so Behe is wrong about the eye. and ive never heard of Behe or anyone talk about HIC other than you.\n\n That's correct they haven't\n \n The human eye is IC in the context of our species but I agree with you that such a context has little meaning.\n \n \nsecretory systems have a certain 'pressure' in both meanings. it's cell membrane is pressurized by these viruses it tries to excrete, and without a proper secretory system, it cannot excrete anything. certain proteins have peptide bonds and enzymes which can adhere to the inner membrane. secretion of certain chemicals can break down a small area of that inner membrane and the first stage of the secretory system can happen - access to the cell membrane. repeat for the cell membrane and you have access to the outer membrane. repeat again and you have a working secretory system. the selection pressure is one that states 'one small upgrade is better than none at all'. the stages happen one on top of the other because its very easy for a protein to bond to the upper most membrane from directly below it. its rare to have a secretory system where one or two of its stages are not in the same place as the last one. this is because of protein drift.\n\n This is the reason I respond line by line, I have no idea what you are responding to if you are responding to anything.\n \n \nyour question of selection pressure between secretory system and flagellum is easy. the secretory system has the ability to rotate. it has all the necessary parts to do that, it just doesnt because why? it doesnt have the necessary parts to provide thrust. peptide bonds and enzymes from proteins attack to the outer membrane and this can provide a very basic propeller. \n\n Do you really think you've answered that question?\n \n \nread through this:\n Evolution of the bacterial flagellum\n \n hopefully the actual research can answer it better than i can. consult the lengthly references section if you have questions on specifics.\n\n I will read it.\n \n \nyou are still arguing that one system cannot change function in its evolution. i say again, almost every complicated system has started off functioning differently than it does now. the retina can be reduced to a heightened patch of light sensative skin cells in basic organisms. the flagellum can be reduced to the bacterial syringe, the bacterial syringe can be reduced to basic cell membrane secretory systems.\n\n Yes I am, you may say the same thing as many times as you wish.",

   "How Can Evolution Cause Irreducibly Complex Systems?\n \n \nLet us imagine a species. Each animal has a workable biochemical system that just has component A. Then a mutation in one animal causes component B. B happens to make the system work better. B is optional, but it's valuable to the individual who contains this improved system. Darwinian natural selection will tend to spread the improvement, until eventually every member of the species inherits it. Now every copy of the biochemical system uses both A and B. \n\n \n i was under the assumption that you knew natural selection did that. it seems you did not. any book on the subject will tell you this.",

   "Excellent, that is the first mistake made about IC.\n \n It is not a statement about the past or future, or even the present.\n \n It is an analysis of a function.\n\n \n As I said, the problem is not the definition per se. You and Behe can define anything however you want. The point that I was making was, what is done with that analysis of function? What Behe does with it is say, anything that is \"irreducibly complex\" can't have evolved, but had rather to have been intelligently designed. This is most definitely a claim about what happened in the past. And it is also a claim that doesn't follow from the definition of \"irreducible complexity.\"\n \n \nAgain I integrated the temporal nature of functions with IC when I invented and expanded the concept of HIC.\n \n I would guess that 90%+ of current system are HIC, at some point all systems probably were.\n \n Systems can change from IC to HIC and vice versa.\n \n HIC = Hybrid Irreducibly complex (not original but who cares).\n \n It means that parts of the system are necessary for function and other parts aren't.\n \n (Yes it is that simple and that clear)\n \n By definition I argued that all systems are either HIC or pure IC, both contain an IC system so this feeling that Behe gives in his book like he found a special example or something is incorrect.\n \n All systems have necessary components.\n \n The eye is HIC, that means it has components that are not necessary.\n\n \n All due respect, but I don't think it's that clear. I see no difference between IC and HIC. In either case, when a part of the system is removed, it ceases to function. That's IC. That's HIC. The only thing the \"H\" does is say that there's other stuff accompanying the system, which isn't relevant to the system's functionality. I don't see why IC itself can't say that.\n \n \nThe proposed evolution of the eye is also what I called IC improvement. IC improvements were a theoretical possibility proved by peeling a while back, he was attempting to show that I shouldn't differentiate between improvement and novelty by proving improvement can fail the guided mutation test; it did not have the effect on me that he was hoping for.\n\n \n I'm afraid I have no idea what this paragraph means. You'll have to be clearer, or -- if it's not essential -- just drop it.\n \n \nI like analogies but you must be clear what parts of the analogy are related, planes are constructed by people with designs.\n\n \n You're drawing the wrong point from the analogy. Yes, it's true that the stepwise process of building an airplane involves people with designs. But the analogy was that both it and evolution involve stepwise processes. The fact that something won't function when certain parts are removed doesn't imply that those parts didn't come together through a processs. I.e., the fact that airplanes won't fly without wing rivets doesn't mean that airplanes just come into existence with wings.\n \n \nIf a plane needed to fly to have selection pressure for better flying than missing rivets would remove that selection pressure as a possibility.\n\n \n How are you using the term \"selection pressure?\" I'm really not sure what to make of your use of the term.\n \n \nThey have always been breakable, and the link between IC and non-evolvability is integrating selection pressure over time.\n\n \n Again, I have no idea what this means.\n \n Please note how my example worked. There, \"selection pressure over time\" drove the evolution of one structure from another, and thus indicated that the structure in question was not irreducibly complex!\n \n Like I said, I suspect you are using the notion of \"selection pressure\" in an idiosyncratic sense.\n \n \nBefore the system is operational by definition there can be no selection pressure for that function.\n\n \n This is not true. Selection pressure in favor of a function can certainly pre-exist the structures by which that function is fulfilled.\n \n Perhaps you are confusing functions and structures.\n \n \nAny change is then by definition random with respect to that function.\n\n \n This is partly true, if the changes in question are simple mutations. Even there, we have to be careful of the notion of \"random.\" It doesn't mean uncaused, just unpredictable.\n \n But moreover, it's not true at all if the change is brought about by natural selection itself. This is why it's called selection pressure: environmental factors \"push\" a given aspect of the organism to evolve in one direction rather than the other.\n \n The initial change may well be random. Later changes, however, are not.\n \n Probably the biggest misconception of all with respect to evolution by natural selection -- really and truly, THE biggest one -- is that it's a \"chance\" process. In fact, while mutation is certainly a matter of chance, natural selection is not a matter of chance at all!\n \n \nSince there selection for a non-existent function or improvement there is no accumulation of mutations beneficial to that function and that means there is no gradual selected change to create it. With respect to natural selection it does not exist.\n\n \n Again, not so. I'm not sure you understand how evolution by natural selection works. As soon as there is a mutation that is beneficial to the organism, selection will tend to promote it in the population of that organism, even if a refined version of that beneficial aspect does not yet exist. Indeed, what evolution says is that the more refined versions will come to exist because of the selection pressure in that direction! Flight didn't pre-exist the development of refined wings -- but less refined versions of such limbs existed before the more refined versions, because even those less refined versions conferred advantages to their possesors.\n \n (Correlatively, mutations that are detrimental will be selected against, and selection will tend to push such things out of the population.)\n \n \nClaiming that evolution can produce it is claiming that selection events will occur based on future benefit; thereby attributing planning (an intelligence) to a naturalistic process which cannot be there.\n\n \n No. What evolution says is that the less refined versions are already experiencing present benefits. The stepwise changes that resulted in birds developing true wings and true flight didn't have to get that far. But at each step along the way, the structures that are \"less refined\" with respect to where things ended up were themselves \"more refined\" with respect to what came before. The less refined versions would no longer confer advantages -- but they did at the time.\n \n As I've said, you don't appear very familiar with how natural selection works. This sort of confusion is why.\n \n \nThe fact that such a selection pressure cannot exist except by chance is not a statement about my imagination.\n\n \n It was definitely a contingent thing, that's true. I'm not sure that amounts to \"by chance.\" As noted earlier, you seem to overestimate the role of chance in evolution, insofar as natural selection is the very opposite of a \"chance\" process.\n \n Nonetheless, you asked, \"What selection pressure for any structure in say I secretory system for a flagellum can there be?\" Your clear implication ws that there could be none, and that's just an argument from incredulity. It reflects your subjective limitations, not anything objective.\n \n And that's why I presented an example of selection pressures that change over time (I \"integrated selection pressure with time,\" as you might say), showing how a combination of genetic possibilities and ecological opportunities (as Sean Carroll might say) can push evolution in a given direction.\n \n \nIf my arguments are sound...\n\n \n They are not. They seem based on a very poor understanding of how evolution by natural selection works.\n \n \n... there is no one on earth who can think of a selection pressure for a non-existent system. The closest (my arguments predict) they will come is co-option.\n\n \n Co-option is the very essence of how the evolutionary process works. The function doesn't pre-exist the organs that fulfill it. It's not sitting out there like an eternally pre-given Platonic form awaiting the structures for its realization.\n \n So if co-option is as close as it comes, that's fine: it can't get any closer, and doesn't even try.\n \n \n... I admit that there is no law preventing any single mutation from doing anything.\n \n My conclusions are about what evolution can produce.\n \n It would be wrong to say evolution can produce a mutation, evolution operates on mutations.\n\n \n This is absolutely correct!\n \n \nSimilarly it is incorrect to say evolution can produce a change or a new system which is claimed to be a lucky hit.\n\n \n And this is also correct, but seems to betray your misunderstanding. To wit: Natural selection is not a matter of luck!!! It is the very opposite of luck, in fact.\n \n \nThis genetic change will fail the guided mutation test, meaning the product is an IC change.\n\n \n I'm afraid here you've lost me again. Mutations are not guided. The variations produced by natural selection aren't \"guided,\" either, if this implies that they are toward a pre-given, final goal, whether set by an intelligence or not. But the variations produced by natural selection do tend to move in discrenible directions, given the circumstances.\n \n \nNow the reason Behe choose the most complicated machines he could find is revealed, he wanted to use the practical impossibility of spontaneous generation to prove ID.\n\n \n But evolution itself acknowledges the impossibility of spontaneously generated complexity!!! The mere fact that complex structures with complex functions don't \"just happen\" spontaneously is not sufficient to establish ID.\n \n Okay, now the next part is particularly weak on your end. I had said that the fact that a flagellum could cease to function as a flagellum -- i.e., that it could break -- does not imply that it didn't evolve. This was the upshot of the entire hypothetical sequence of events I laid out with the bacteria example: There is a plausible way in which the flagellum could evolve from something else, and the fact that flagella can break doesn't contradict that narrative. Your entire response? Thus:\n \n \nIt does imply.\n\n \n Mere counter-assertion, with no substantive discussion of the plausibility of that narrative at all. So I will simply reassert my conclusion: Breakability does not entail non-evolvability. Even something that evolves can break.\n \n \nYou may come to realize some day that the same could be said for just about every evolutionary story, what makes some look elegant or plausible is good poetics and a healthy imagination.\n\n \n Not my point. In science, one should try to go beyond mere speculation. One should attempt to back up one's hypotheses. Insofar as I didn't do that, I made no claim of truth for the hypothetical narrative.\n \n But what ID is saying is that the story itself makes no sense, simply because the final result wouldn't function if some of its parts were missing. And it is this claim of ID that itself makes no sense, in logical terms: there is absolutely no relation of logical entailment here; it's a logical non sequitur.\n \n Which brings me to a few brief and curious comments:\n \n \nAgain you are correct, it is possible.\n \n Your story in fact did not contain anything with which IC would take offense.\n\n \n But if that's so, then what is the point of IC? What that story represents is a possible sequence of events by which a structure could evolve, even though that structure would fail to function if its parts were removed. ID via IC says that, if something would fail when its parts (or its essential parts, in your HIC sense) are removed, it can't have evolved! This is exactly the opposite of the point of my narrative!!!\n \n \nOne could apply the same concept as homology with secretory system to say that since proteins existed before flagella, flagella are not IC.\n \n This not being the same sense of the word reducible as is used in the term IC.\n\n \n Then in what sense is IC using the term? I confess, I no longer have any clue what IC says is \"irreducible\" about the structures it discusses. Enlighten me on the meaning of \"irreducible.\"\n \n \nIs it a good book?\n\n \n Very. I recommend it highly, and it may correct what appear to some significant misunderstandings of evolution here.\n \n \nActually it spontaneously formed, Behe does not claim this cannot happen and has several examples of it in the edge of evolution to illustrate his point about the consequences of abandoning gradual selection.\n\n \n Again you've lost me. What is \"it?\" The mutations? The capacity for citrate metabolism in the bacteria? Something else entirely?\n \n I think we can rule out the power to metabolize citrate. It did not just happen, but was the result of a pair of mutations, taken in concert.\n \n Even the mutations are only spontaneous in the sense that we have no idea what caused them. But they didn't \"just happen\"; something caused them, even if we know not what.\n \n So I find your comment completely confusing. I don't understand what you're talking about.\n \n \nIf they are different then the accumulation of beneficial changes will be different.\n\n \n Yes. But this does not imply that benefical feature B cannot have evolved from beneficial feature A. That, to reiterate, was the entire point of my hypothetical narrative. The benefits are indeed different. And yet the one evolved from the other.\n \n \ni.e. what makes a good door may not make a good window, if it does it's by chance.\n\n \n But if what makes a good door changes by natural selection in order to become a good window -- at which point it's no longer a good door -- this is not by chance. Because natural selection is not a chance process.\n \n \nProvided the ancestral system begins to function differently bringing about a change in selection pressures, again this is skipping over the event in question.\n\n \n What event is skipped? You're saying that the system changes the selection pressures that bring it about?\n \n -sigh-\n \n I'm sorry, Freedom, but I really find it difficult to follow your reasoning. I don't think you're using terms the way evolutionary biologists use them.",

(confusingly also called IC do to it's role in the argument).\n \n The supportive statement in that argument is the integration of selection pressure (as I have said).\n \n For IC to mean 'not evolvable' right from the get go that would have to be it's definition which would make it a tautologous but useless idea.\n \n \n \nAll due respect, but I don't think it's that clear. I see no difference between IC and HIC.\n\n Then you need to think about it more.\n \n I will give the definitions again to help.\n \n An IC system is - A system in which the removal of any part or component removes the function.\n \n A HIC system is - A system in which the removal of one or more parts/components removes the function.\n \n All HIC systems have a IC core, all IC systems fit the definition of HIC.\n \n I call systems that fit the definition of HIC but not IC HIC, I call the ones that fit both IC.\n \n This kind of categorical delimitation is extremely common in human communication so I am sure you can understand.\n \n \nIn either case, when a part of the system is removed, it ceases to function.

The function doesn't pre-exist the organs that fulfill it. It's not sitting out there like an eternally pre-given Platonic form awaiting the structures for its realization.\n\n Then you will have to make an argument as to the existance of co-option in specific relation to the isolation of functional sequences.\n \n \nSo if co-option is as close as it comes, that's fine: it can't get any closer, and doesn't even try.\n\n Very good, this is where I left off with peeling, I await your response eagerly.\n \n \nNatural selection is not a matter of luck!!! It is the very opposite of luck, in fact.\n\n Which is why it is incorrect.\n \n \nI'm afraid here you've lost me again. Mutations are not guided.\n\n It's a misnomer, guided genetic change is what it should be called.\n \n \nThe variations produced by natural selection aren't \"guided,\" either, if this implies that they are toward a pre-given, final goal, whether set by an intelligence or not. But the variations produced by natural selection do tend to move in discrenible directions, given the circumstances.\n\n I realize it's a post facto conceptualization of function to say that there is an improved direction and a less efficient direction.\n \n If you keep improving a function you will get a very improved function, you can validly call that the goal of natural selection even if it doesn't 'know' it itself.\n \n \nBut evolution itself acknowledges the impossibility of spontaneously generated complexity!!! \n\n Rational evolution does, but 'recognize' is an odd action for a theory to be capable of.\n \n Do you mean it is used as a premise?\n \n \nThe mere fact that complex structures with complex functions don't \"just happen\" spontaneously is not sufficient to establish ID.\n\n Agreed, it was Behe who thought he was ready to prove ID after disproving irrational evolution. I am not.\n \n \nMere counter-assertion, with no substantive discussion of the plausibility of that narrative at all. So I will simply reassert my conclusion: Breakability does not entail non-evolvability. Even something that evolves can break.\n\n It was a counter-counter assertion.\n \n \nBut if that's so, then what is the point of IC? What that story represents is a possible sequence of events by which a structure could evolve, even though that structure would fail to function if its parts were removed. ID via IC says that, if something would fail when its parts (or its essential parts, in your HIC sense) are removed, it can't have evolved! This is exactly the opposite of the point of my narrative!!!\n\n Your narrative did not show it evolving, it did as bennedict has been doing this 'tracing'.\n \n If you were expecting IC to claim that any given mutation can't happen or that any given co-option can't happen you were mistaken.\n \n Just mutation and just co-option are random and cannot compose the evolutionary concept.\n \n Selection must negate randomness and produce pattern.\n \n What you still have not gotten was that the 'beef' of what IC (the argument) is talking about, the actual part that is not and cannot be evolution is:\n \n \"Eventually, however, a fortunate strain of the baceterium undergoes a mutation that does code for the organelle, and yields a significant modification -- a modification that for a change has a positive impact on survival and reproduction. The former secretory system lengthens and can provide locomotion.\"\n \n This is the hand waved production of function, I see no mention of selection pressures, time or any other of the answers I have asked for.\n \n I do not consider it valid that you included these before and after the event in question.\n \n I nor Behe ever claimed that a new system would not be selected for and refined or that an old system could become vestigial.\n \n \nThen in what sense is IC using the term? I confess, I no longer have any clue what IC says is \"irreducible\" about the structures it discusses. Enlighten me on the meaning of \"irreducible.\"\n\n The system is irreducible as in you cannot reduce it's complexity without losing it's function, not irreducible as in you can point out homologies in it's parts.\n \n \nAgain you've lost me. What is \"it?\" The mutations? The capacity for citrate metabolism in the bacteria? Something else entirely?\n\n Yes, the same it you claimed evolved.\n \n \nI think we can rule out the power to metabolize citrate. It did not just happen, but was the result of a pair of mutations, taken in concert.\n\n Same thing without a selection event.\n \n \nEven the mutations are only spontaneous in the sense that we have no idea what caused them. But they didn't \"just happen\"; something caused them, even if we know not what.\n\n I am calling any single or string of unselected mutations random, therefore any positive result spontaneously generated.\n \n \nYes. But this does not imply that benefical feature B cannot have evolved from beneficial feature A. That, to reiterate, was the entire point of my hypothetical narrative. The benefits are indeed different.

If you stop to think of it though if every evolutionary story requires that another system or structure be drafted as an ancestor wouldn't they have to contradict, everything can't be everything elses ancestor right?\n \n In fact that hypothesis is supported by the evidence.\n \n Scientist have tried to explain a flagellum saying it is a modified type III secretory system. (As repeated here)\n \n Different scientist have tried to explain a type III secretory system saying it a modified flagellum.\n \n In fact it is believed that a flagellum existed before there were prey to make a type III secretory system useful.\n \n Would that fact stop bennedict's or any other evolutionists stories?\n \n The answer would no it would not, as long as there is any homology in any system a story can be told.\n \n A story could be told based on the fact that every system is composed of proteins, one would just have to have the right audience and say it confidently enough.\n \n There is no standard to what he calls proof of evolution except that it should 'sound plausible'.\n \n He like you (apparently) mistakes IC for another disguised form of the 'missing link fossil' argument.\n \n That argument just as you pointed out by analogy is inherently flawed because there would be an almost unlimited number of intermediate organisms, and the chances of finding a freak 'inception' individual who mutated greatly are negligible.\n \n Finding every single selected mutation in a species via fossils is not a proper or fair standard of proof.\n \n Unlike that case though IC is not speaking about missing links but missing selection pressures.\n \n Even if you could find intermediates for every selected mutation leading up to a flagellum it would still remained unexplained by evolution if you could not come up with a non-random selection pressure to explain the selection.\n \n This brings up an interesting observation, Behe and I concentrate on molecular systems; while evolutionist (including the orginal - not that he had a choice) favour macroscopic systems.\n \n The reason for this lies in two facts:\n 1. Almost as a rule there are smooth functional gradients for macroscopic body shapes.\n \n 2. The control sequences for the size and shape of limbs and organs are small and large changes can be effected by small mutations.\n \n 1. matters because that means almost any change can be validly thought of as an improvement, a fluke is a specialized limb; there was no advanced or complex change at any point in it's proposed evolution. If you take away one of the mutations that may have caused it you will get a slightly less effective fluke not a fatal stump.\n \n 2. matters because it means the mutations complexity to effect a given beneficial change is typically small and therefore easily selectable.\n \n Well what does IC have to say when applied to a macroscopic case like this?\n \n It passes the guided mutation test easily, these sorts of patterns are expected by rational evolution.\n \n It exposes a very key point in discussing what a function actually is in respect to IC, it is the biological class of machine that matters not the specific application.\n \n For instance if a flagellum was used for swimming and a modified version was used to somehow walk. They would have different selection pressures and refine and diverge from each other; they are technically different final functions but the actual function being spoken of is turning a filament extending from the cell in a rotary fashion given an ion gradient.\n \n In macroscopic terms the same applies, a flukes actual biological function is a specialized limbs function, a limb functions by pulling on bones with muscles.\n \n Muscles and bones, now those are not merely specialized versions some other structure.\n \n It is easy from studying macroscopic changes like this to understand why Darwin took smooth functional gradients as a given and proposed his theory. With the data he had it was rational.\n \n The only mistake Darwin made (and it can't really be called a mistake) is assuming that life was a inherent property in some matter, I had the same idea (sub-consciously) before I took biology classes.\n \n Now the problem arises (an 90% of all my arguments with evolutionist focus around this) arises when they try to apply the same principles they did on most macroscopic systems to the actual machines themselves without thinking it through.\n \n They assume smooth functional gradients, they assume every function or structure is merely a different shape of another, they assume complex structures are just a small mutation away, and they assume one thing that is invalid in both micro and macroscopic levels, they assume co-option.\n \n A flagellum does not have a smooth functional gradient, it stops working when you don't have the necessary parts.\n \n A flagellum is not merely a different shape of type III secretory system; it is a distinct system, not just a pile of type III secretory systems or a large type III secretory systems (as is often the difference between limb and organs).\n \n They assume there are trivial mutations that will convert a secretory system into a flagellum.\n \n They assume that there is a reason why a secretory system looks like a flagellum, yet on all cases I have not heard a sound reason for co-option.\n \n \na simple yes or no answer will do. since ive shown you that the retina could have evolved from light sensative skin cells, does that mean the retina is not IC and therefore the eye is not HIC?\n\n Fallacy of a Loaded question.\n \n \n\n and in no way am i putting up with an argument about how skin cells are IC and therefore the retina is HIC.\n\n All cells themselves are IC or HIC, the organelles in cells are IC or HIC, the structures composing the organelles are IC or HIC, DNA is IC (just IC). The first life is IC.\n \n When I said that every system is either IC or HIC I was not exaggerating for effect.\n \n The only changes you will be able to bring to me that have ever evolved were improvements on the same functional domain.",

(well not quite but...)\n \n A secretory system has homology in structure to a flagellum despite being unrelated in selection pressures and function.\n \n This homology is necessarily inherent in the system yet also it was not produced by any non-random process.\n \n If asked for a reason why a secretory system has co-option with a flagellum you would not have sound answer.\n \n The only two possible answers I could imagine you giving are:\n \n 1. Because one evolved from another (this is circular reasoning).\n \n 2. Luck (chance)\n \n Evolution did not produce this co-option just like it could not produce a flagellum.\n \n Assuredly one could assert that it exists so no explanation is necessary but that would be perhaps the most unscientific attitude to have.\n \n The path that peeling took (the only serious debater against IC I have seen in a long time), was to suggest that the fitness landscape was so scattered with coherent evolutionary pathways (that is generally linear sequences of small beneficial mutations which accumulate into what humans would later conceptualize as a complex well operating machine); that the fitness landscape was so scattered with coherent evolutionary pathways that as a matter of random intersection co-option existed in enough places to form a tree of co-option (he at this point had accepted the IC argument) which was so large that it encompassed all novel functions in the history of life on this planet.\n \n My argument against that was that the observed ratios of beneficial, neutral, and detrimental mutations did not support that concept of a fitness landscape.\n \n Most systems exist on their own functional domains, isolated by hundreds of base pairs from others even in their most simplistic forms.\n \n The land scape is full of dead ends, that is beneficial strings which arrive at a maximum benefit and natural selection keeps them from significant movement from there. (this is observed in species today).\n \n The environmental changes (including other species) can push a species off one of these hills by negating the benefit peak or by making another area beneficial, but it cannot form a string that did not already exist as a potential.\n \n As long as you assume this co-option tree exists as you think it must the problem will be to explain species getting bumped to new strings, i.e. equilibrium must be punctuated. Yet though this can move a species on the landscape it cannot create the landscape, the sequence that makes a flagellum work is the sequence that makes a flagellum work. The benefit exists on the two conditions that the system exists and the function is useful in the current environment. You can remove the second but that only 'hides' the landscape from the species. In other words a function being useful in the current environment can't change the sequence required to construct it (duh).\n \n That being said I used the flagellum because you asked for specifics and that's every one's favourite example apparently.\n \n It is also a perfect example of what I am talking about in this post's discourse.\n \n I said an example of co-option with a flagellum would be the secretory system, well that is how it is trying to be portrayed but that is not what I mean when I say a system can be co-opted.\n \n I mean it could actually switch functions with a reasonable mutation.\n \n In reality a flagellum is a sheer pinnacle of function.\n \n Above I said the functional domains could be separated by hundreds of base pairs, assuming that you meant the secretory system when you were talking about a 'flagellum' with 40 or 50 parts (assuming you meant proteins), and assuming that each protein had one amino acid (yea I know they have more but I am giving a lower bound).\n \n Then 120 - 150 base pairs plus control sequences, times the actual size of the proteins is the field of neutrality or detriment that separates them.\n \n You don't want to calculate the odds trust me.\n \n This is why the stories imply, but again do not actually specify; the presumption of a multi-co-option. That is not only did one system fit the needed parameters for another non-existent system, but several did it at the same time. (Explaining the flagellum as a miraculous association of homologous systems).\n \n \ngenotype dude, genotype. if something is beneficial it increases the frequency of the genotype - more accurately, it increases the frequency of the allele. theres a big difference between genotype, phenotype and allele, you learn the difference in an introductory class in evolutionary biology.\n\n Does it matter? The phenotype is what is selected so it must accompany any genotype that is inherited.\n \n \nit is a product of natural selection.\n\n This will be the third time I asked you to justify that.",

It could be used as an intermediate for improvements based off of that but evolution would not have produced that change itself.\n \n More importantly though the catch 'single part', as I said evolution doesn't produce mutations any more than it can produce IC systems.\n \n The fact that NS can't select a single mutation before it happens is easily accepted, yet the same principle applied to larger structures is not; you've heard my speculations as to why.\n \n When Behe points out a large structure that cannot be selected until it exists, then everyone seems to have a problem because they require it to be produced by evolution; as dawkins points out things just don't appear.",

   "Dawkins said that because the typical creationist has this picture of fully formed limbs appearing in a single mutation. This is of course wrong (though not impossible). \n\n Limbs may be where you draw the line but I remember when you drew it at 20 amino acids.\n \n \nBut why do you have such a problem with new function arising or co-option? Look at it this way\n\n I only have a problem with saying that's evolution. No process creates co-option and co-option originated the system. You could (and I think did) try to argue that evolution does in fact produce the novel system as it need to select it once it exists or it needs to be moving the previous system along it's unrelated path but if evolution actually produced it, that would mean it would have to be selected for; there can be no evolution without natural selection (pure random) and the guided mutation test told us definitely there were no selection events. It is shown that every attempt to credit evolution with the production of the system in question is post fact conceptual confusion on our part. Analogous to saying that jet fuel on a passenger plane creates flight, while necessary in many cases it is still the aerodynamics of the wings that are the crucial active element.\n \n \n(I know I've used this before, but you seem be a little more accepting of certain premises now).\n\n I am in fact not, but this is bennedict's first round through while we left off at the 25th or something :p\n \n If he keeps on dodging the truth about selection pressures for another 50 pages then I will start to refer him back to what I have already said and nothing more.\n \n No offense databed but when peeling accepted the logic that you wouldn't after the better part of two threads it really felt like some evolutionist are just as bad as religious when it comes to honest debate.\n \n The is perhaps one of the few arguments I have online in which I do not have a serious personal stake in, I don't think you can say the same.\n \n Anyway you eventually did but it sounded like you just understood what I was saying and weren't surprised at all.\n \n I truly hope it doesn't take that long to click for bennedict but I can't predict which of the 5000 ways to present the concept of IC will not be guarded by prejudice.\n \n \nFish have fins. At some point a fish comes to occupy a niche at the sea bottom and it's fins become walking fins. Then they become out of water walking fins and develop more structure and strength suitable for this purpose. Lets then say the spines on the ends of the fins become useful for digging in mud. So claws emerge and eventually they are used for climbing and later full hands emerge and are used for grasping. You shouldn't have any particular problem with this scenario since there is no single large leap, right?\n\n You're right I did answer this before.\n \n If it is truly the case that the function existed at every point then there is no leap.\n \n The first time around I think I choose the digging in the mud part to be my example of a possible roadblock. If for any reason the fish could not dig in the mud with it's fins it would never experience the selection pressure to become a better digger as it's members would never be engaged in that activity. If the ability to dig where the ability did not exist arose it would be either a single random mutation or equivalent series of unselected random mutations (with respect to digging). It would not be evolved but essentially spontaneously generate.\n \n The reason I don't call single or double base pair mutations IC (although by the guided mutation test they are) is because that doesn't have much meaning. These mutations spontaneously generate enough to make evolving them unnecessary and indeed IC tells us impossible.\n \n It is the large complex systems that present a problem if they are IC because spontaneous generations quickly aproaches practical impossibility. If Behe is right about the odds it could be as quickly as 10 base pairs for an average population size + mutation rate.\n \n I would like to take this opportunity to restate something you seem confused about in our previous debates.\n \n That last paragraph about odds is an argument based on odds. You often called that an appeal to odds and claimed my argument was based on that.\n \n That argument is about what happened and what didn't happen, the final probability of currently understood naturalistic explanation. It is not, however; the odds of something evolving. That argument (IC) did not contain odds, it deductively concluded that the unselected equals the unevolved nothing more.\n \n \nBut now remove any information we have about the intermediate stages and think of me trying to convince you that fins turned into hands.\n\n and I loved your example because of this observation, knowledge of the intermediates did not actually effect the outcome of the guided mutation test.\n \n The hand could come about without ever leaving the water or having claws, the hand it merely modified extremes of parts the fin already has.\n \n It could and did pass the guided mutation test if it had the ability to grasp things even in the slightest underwater.\n \n If the potential for minimal hand function did not exist it would not have been there after leaving the water either, you would see a shift in functional domain.\n \n What if there was a part missing, one that made it impossible to move along one of the steps you referenced?\n \n It could still be missing and if wasn't required for ideal grasping function it would still pass the test.\n \n The test is in fact more inclusive than a proposed series of intermediates, it accounts for any and all evolutionary pathways; a fact that rendered the repeated and continuing attempts to dissuade me by coming up with new ones meaningless.\n \n \nI know you will do your usual one sentence at a time nit pick, but try to address the idea instead of specific steps.\n\n The idea was gradual selected change accumulating into large beneficial changes right? I have heard that before :)\n \nI can come up with more examples if I have to.\n\n kk, how about one where there is a guided switch between functional domains?\n \n \nThat being said, is it any coincidence that all of your examples of IC are at the microscopic level where information about previous structures is almost always lost?\n\n No, I posted something about this earlier on this thread. In response to symbiote I believe.\n \n \nThis is the only place where your argument holds any water since any large scale examples of IC typically have a fossil record for the evolutionist to make some comparison.\n\n I have a different theory about that.\n \n \nNot only is the evolutionary path found in these cases, but by using other sciences such as dating or historical climate studies, an explanation for why this happened the way it did can be formulated.\n\n What we see is usually skeleton shape and mussel distribution, since mussels are on the same functional domain as mussels of various sizes and the same goes for bones what you call evolutionary pathways to novel systems don't really fit the definition.\n \n In other cases like flight though we see transitional fossils between small theropods and birds but this does not explain why the transformations were happening.\n \n Remember I don't reject common descent, a fact which you never really integrated with my rejection of irrational evolution.\n \n \nSo, can you come up with an example of IC where the structure of this example is not lost when the organism dies? I doubt that you can.\n\n Well I do have one that includes bones but I don't think that it fits the bill of 'not lost when the organism dies', as the crucial part is still soft tissue and bio-chemical.\n \n To be honest though bones aren't that complicated compared to the soft and microscopic parts of the body.\n \n The first bone would probably be an example, but you would object saying that you wouldn't be able to see precursors.\n \n Anyway this creature is in possession of an IC defense system, and it's via bones.\n \n There is no intermediate selection pressure to what would almost certainly pass as fatal wounds for any other organism even ones with good healing abilities already.\n \n \ntrue, unless there is pressure for a certain function, and that pressure is brought about by a regional change - and one current function that the organism already has has the ability to become modified to fit that function.\n\n Not just become modified, already capable of the function or else all the regional changes in the world can't conjure a selection pressure.\n \n You could be in the ocean adrift and about to die but the fact that an oar would be the most useful thing in the world to you doesn't mean that something must be capable of being used as an oar.\n \n \nwhat ive just shown is something that is surprisingly common, and youll find with every IC example that is an upgraded form from another feature with a different function can possibly be a result of evolution via co-option via directional selection.\n\n I don't care if you call it an upgrade of santa's toys, if the function does not exist it will not be selected for.

   "In this case it means the most basic definition of temporal which is the adjective form of time.\n\n Let's not be disingenuous. If temporal referred to something that \"occurs in time\" then everything is temporal and the term is pointless. If we're talking about a selection event, the very name clearly implies that its not an common occurance that takes place on a regular basis. \n \n \nI won't believe that, almost all behavior of a create of that level is triggered. They certainly do not teach their offspring that orange means full belly.\n \n\n Remember, orange spots did not replace fat bellies in guppies. They developed orange spots when they were well fed, but without the orange spots bigger fuller guppies would be the better selected ones. Having an orange spot makes selection more apparent, and makes males easier to see in low light or muddy water. I can explain how easy the big belly-orange spot association would be, and I can give you other examples of simple instinctive associations that don't require the entire population to have their brains rewired, but maybe later. \n \n \nWell you can say that but the only way for a selection pressure to affect a gene pool is via selection events.\n\n Let's look at your claim. You're saying that selection pressure NEVER occurs without a selection event. I say that selection pressure always exists. If gazelles developed a mutation that allowed them to run even faster, wouldn't it be selected for, even in the absence of an habitat-changing event?\n \nI have already given a couple examples and I would be happy to give more.\n\n So can I. Remember, you're trying to support the claim that mutations are never selected for without a selection event. An example of a mutation that is selected for as a result of a selection event wouldn't prove that such is always the case. But just one example of a mutation that is selected for without a selection event would prove that exceptions to your claim exist. \n \n \nA function is the most general form of the action carried about by the system, the applications are specific circumstance well applications.\n \n For instance the function of a car is to move people about, but wait isn't a function of a car also to move people to work? to go on vacation?\n \n So does it have a near infinite number of functions or a near infinite number of applications?\n \n The function is the root category of all the applications, they all fit into that definition.\n \n You're examples were adequate in showing another aspect which we have since been ignoring (at evolutionist peril). Control systems, in life it is not just practical to have a function but it also needs to be controlled, that means 'reporting' data about the structure and the function as it's being carried out and receiving signals to carry out the function.\n \n Obviously I did not think of that so if you want to call control systems a second function we can.\n \n In which case almost all functions have a corresponding control system.\n \n I have pointed out many times why this exponentially increases the impropriety of appealing to odds. Also notice that it does not negate the actual point I was making, we started this discussion because it seemed you were trying to argue for fundamental co-option (i.e. structures can hardly help but have more than one function), but since a control system is even more specific to the function than the structure is in almost all cases this compounds the problem, unless you are now going to argue that structures can hardly help but have a function and the control system inherent to it's nature.\n\n Well obviously functions of control, feedback and regulation are often just as vital to the organisms' survival as sensory or motion functions. But besides that, even in the case of what you refer to as \"basic function\", when an \"application\" becomes a common use, the line becomes blurry. Squirrels use their front legs as hands. Are they hands that can be used for running or feet that can be used for holding things?\n \n The concept of co-option is that a feature or structure in an organism can have multiple legitimate functions, and though a single feature may have a function that does not give it an advantage, another function of the same structure may provide such a great advantage that it is still selected for. Back to the example of our guppies. An orange spot on the fattest males would obviously make them an easier target for predators. In a situation where the spot did not provide such a huge replication value, the gene frequency would not increase. \n \n Like I pointed out, practically all structures have multiple functions, and the idea of co-option would apply. In the case of structures that are said to be irreducibly complex, structures can actually develop from co-option and multiple applications. The structure does not have to be a \"simple\" version of the end result function, neither does it need to serve the same function at all. Proponents of IR seem to overlook this fact or simply refuse to believe it, but its definitely an important consideration in analyzing the IR case studies\nI was just interested in a fact I didn't know. I meant rotary as in continuous rotational motion, a leg can never complete 2pi radians, a flagellum or car wheel has no such limitation. \n\n Your arm can. And your foot does when you ride a bicycle. Not being restricted to a fixed radius makes us much more efficient than wheels",

I have never heard the term selection event used in a sense other than the direct meaning of the words.\n \n A selection event would be an occurrence in which something about an organism is selected by natural selection.\"\n \n You were basically saying that selection event had to mean an environmental change as opposed to the natural meaning of the phrase.\n \n \n The females choice, the entire lifespan of an organism is an event.\n \n \n \n As I said about the word belief, give me a better term if you would take mine.\n \n \n Every selection is the result of a selection event.

Bennedict's example of orange spots in Trinidad guppies was perfect. \n \n We know what the word event means, and we were under the assumption that you did.

No, what you did was rather than concede that you were mistaken about the cause of selection pressure, you redefine the word event. \n \n I was very gracious about it the first time when you redefined the word temporal for the same purpose.

   "Let's not be disingenuous. If temporal referred to something that \"occurs in time\" then everything is temporal and the term is pointless.\n\n So I thought but some did not seem to understand that since selection is in time there must be a selection event. i.e. it did not happen outside of time.\n \n \nIf we're talking about a selection event, the very name clearly implies that its not an common occurance that takes place on a regular basis. \n\n Not to me, event means event, selection means selection.\n \n \nRemember, orange spots did not replace fat bellies in guppies. They developed orange spots when they were well fed, but without the orange spots bigger fuller guppies would be the better selected ones. Having an orange spot makes selection more apparent, and makes males easier to see in low light or muddy water. I can explain how easy the big belly-orange spot association would be, and I can give you other examples of simple instinctive associations that don't require the entire population to have their brains rewired, but maybe later. \n\n So basically co-option, guppies had orange spots before they were beneficial, and because the pigmentation had significance in determining health it created a selection pressure in females to go after orange males.\n \n \nLet's look at your claim. You're saying that selection pressure NEVER occurs without a selection event.\n\n I updated that with more precise words, selection pressure is irrelevant or meaningless without selection events. (it must be selected every time it moves through a generation).\n \n \nI say that selection pressure always exists. If gazelles developed a mutation that allowed them to run even faster, wouldn't it be selected for, even in the absence of an habitat-changing event?\n\n Yes it would, and that occurrence would be a selection event.\n \n \nSo can I. Remember, you're trying to support the claim that mutations are never selected for without a selection event.\n\n yes and it is easy because a selection event is the occurrence of selection.\n \n \nAn example of a mutation that is selected for as a result of a selection event wouldn't prove that such is always the case.\n\n When a mutation is selected for, it is a selection event.\n \n \nBut besides that, even in the case of what you refer to as \"basic function\"\n\n Where did I say basic function? I am quite sure I used the word general.\n \n \nwhen an \"application\" becomes a common use, the line becomes blurry. Squirrels use their front legs as hands. Are they hands that can be used for running or feet that can be used for holding things?\n\n They are limbs, whose shape is ideal for the applications the organism is using them for.\n \n \nThe concept of co-option is that a feature or structure in an organism can have multiple legitimate functions\n\n In the context of IC it is the concept of a system achieving a function by coincidence as opposed to selection.\n \n It is used to try to explain away the point of IC (the argument) by giving an alternative to gradual selection. That is it's purpose but many know that such an admission validates what I have been saying about the difference between the process and chance so they try to graft gradual selection that is irrelevant to the case, the gradual selection of the proposed predecessor system.\n \n Co-option it is supposed to be the assembly or transformation of the function of a system by creating the structure first, without selection for that function.\n \n i.e. secretory system, it's transforming, it's evolving and then bang look it's a flagellum, no selection pressure for a flagellum? Doesn't matter secretory systems are flagella.\n \n \nand though a single feature may have a function that does not give it an advantage, another function of the same structure may provide such a great advantage that it is still selected for.\n\n i.e. reducing multiple functions two few or one, bennedict already gave several examples.\n \n \nLike I pointed out, practically all structures have multiple functions, and the idea of co-option would apply.\n\n Do not confuse what advantages a system will confer after it exists and is refined for what it inherently does.\n \n Muscles for instance, you said protect the blood vessels, well mussels may do so but if you had a sheath for blood vessels you could hardly say that those must be muscles.\n \n The function of muscles is to contract, not to shield blood vessels, as evidenced by the fundamental nature of the cellular machinery.\n \n \n \n In the case of structures that are said to be irreducibly complex, structures can actually develop from co-option and multiple applications. The structure does not have to be a \"simple\" version of the end result function, neither does it need to serve the same function at all.\n \n Proponents of IR seem to overlook this fact or simply refuse to believe it, but its definitely an important consideration in analyzing the IR case studies\n\n It is not overlooked it is found to be untrue. (at least as far as 'evolving' something)\n \n \nYour arm can. And your foot does when you ride a bicycle. Not being restricted to a fixed radius makes us much more efficient than wheels\n\n I am not talking about a point on an organ, otherwise I am a rotary machine when I walk in circles.\n \n \n \nAll along I've been trying to give you the benefit of the doubt, but right here you just crossed the line into plain lying and dishonesty.\n \n I suppose I shall make my first post in the liars corner then?\n \n \nWe know what the word event means, and we were under the assumption that you did. Now you're resorting to changing the definition of the word to mean the entire life of the organism? As a matter of fact, you'd have to change the definition to mean the entire existence of the fish kingdom, and by extension the animal kingdom as a whole for all cases where mate selection and sexual reproduction exist. Really? That is not an event, and you damn well know it.\n \n The definition did not change for me, apparently it did for you two.\n \n \nIf you're arguing that the entire lifeline of the guppies species is one event, then why argue against bennedict, whose point was that the pressure for sexual selection exists throughout the lifetimes af all the fish?\n\n The entire lifeline of a species is an event but not a selection event.\n \n A selection event can last the lifespan of a creature of the benefit it experienced due to some allele affected it it's entire life. (such as searching for food).\n \n Now I don't know how often guppies mate but I assumed they were like most fish with great coordinated spawning events, in which case the selection event corresponding to sexual selection would last while the female behavior is modified by the orange color, not that long.\n \n A selection event must occur for every selected mutation by definition although more than one selection event can occur for the same mutation.\n \n \nNo, what you did was rather than concede that you were mistaken about the cause of selection pressure\n\n Selection events do not cause selection pressure selection pressure causes selection events given the DNA with benefit in the direction of that pressure.\n \n \n you redefine the word event.\n \n Me and the conspiratorial dictionary.com\n \n \nYou're not making it look good for yourself or for creationists as a whole....\n\n I'm not a creationist by my definition but by bennedicts I am.\n \n Given that no one has been able to defeat my spin on the IC argument in three debate forums and probably over 50 threads and 600 pages of text, including several who claimed to be scientist (or scientist in training); it couldn't look much better.",

All of which was responded to.\n \n 1.) We agreed on the definition of IC, however I never got confirmation that you corrected the error about the function as opposed to any function. (This being the same mistake ken M. made)\n \n Do you realize now that IC means you can't remove any parts without removing the function.\n \n And therefore if you start removing the parts of a flagellum and end up with a secretory system you have not preserved the function?\n \n 2.) Although you never directly challenged my statements on the matter you never confirmed that you know that a system or function cannot be selected for before it is functional, and so by definition before it exists?\n \n 3.) I claimed that 2 meant that a novel system could never evolve because by definition there would never be any selection for it, and mutation without selection is random.\n \n You did challenge my statements about the implication of 2.; You said that selection pressure for existing systems can still produce non-existent systems.\n \n You gave many evolutionary stories but you did not explain how this was possible in a non-random manner.\n \n Do you admit that you have not explained this?\n \n 4.) I said co-option in this context means that an existing system is so near identical to a non-existent system that a small mutation can the functions of the system.\n \n Do you agree with this definition?\n \n 5.)

Plus, these functions can be applied in different environments (applications) to serve as even more functions. If any of these functions are beneficial to the survival of the organism, then the structure itself will be selected for. A mutation may allow the organism's secondary function to surpass the usefullness of its primary function. Or an environmental change may require more use of the secondary function than the primary. It doesn't matter if the structure wasn't originally selected because of the secondary function, its a valid way for a complex structure to be selected. \n \nDo not confuse what advantages a system will confer after it exists and is refined for what it inherently does.\n \n Muscles for instance, you said protect the blood vessels, well mussels may do so but if you had a sheath for blood vessels you could hardly say that those must be muscles.\n \n The function of muscles is to contract, not to shield blood vessels, as evidenced by the fundamental nature of the cellular machinery.\n \n\n You are right.

   "freedom. im using up my lunch break for this, so pay attention.\n \n to summarize my arguments,\n 1) you argued both ID and IC, i named the two novel examples of IC and drew an illustration of how they could have evolved. your argument against this was that in the case of the eye, it is HIC because the retina is IC. it is IC because skin cells cannot form into a retina (this will be co-option, cue #2)\n 2) in the case of both retina and flagellum, i was able to show you that although they did not share a common function with the original features they evolved from, natural selection still selected those co-opted features for sheer benefit of the organism. i gave you numerous examples of how a feature could have co-opted via directional selection (a branch of natural selection) and you fought back saying that there is no selection pressure for a function that does not exist.\n 3) i showed you that a co-option had to have come about after a selection event (we will get into that later), and if the feature has the essentials to perform this new function, and that new function is beneficial to the organism in the new environment, it will be selected for via directional selection. i even named you a second selection pressure that could have produced co-option, disruptive selection which separates the function of a multi-functioning feature and makes those two functions independent (ie. bacterial syringe vs flagellum). these are two selection pressures within natural selection that follow a change in environment and can produce co-option.\n 4) you then stated that selection pressure needed a selection event to happen, and we argued the definition of \"selection event\". in any case, with co-option, this is correct, and redundant because there would be a selection event that takes place when we are talking about co-option via directional or disruptive selection, regardless of our disagreement with the definition. directional and disruptive selection either follow or happen at the same time as a selection event, depending on the definition of selection event, when co-option is happening.\n \n anyways, im happy to continue this debate, just not about \"selection event\" (im still waiting for that email). in regards to our discussion so far, neither one of us are in the position to say who is right and who is wrong, so as much as i dread bringing a third party into an evo vs create conversation to moderate (to formally debate a creationist is to flatter him into thinking his idea is scientifically legitimate), if anyone has read the conversation thus far and wishes to post an opinion, please do so, especially if you are neutral on the subject.",

   "An IC system is - A system in which the removal of any part or component removes the function.\n \n A HIC system is - A system in which the removal of one or more parts/components removes the function.\n \n All HIC systems have a IC core, all IC systems fit the definition of HIC.\n \n I call systems that fit the definition of HIC but not IC HIC, I call the ones that fit both IC.\n \n This kind of categorical delimitation is extremely common in human communication so I am sure you can understand.\n\n \n I do understand that. But what is the difference between \"any\" and \"one or more?\"\n \n In logic, the former is universal, while the latter is particular. But per your usage above, that doesn't seem to be what's going on here.\n \n The only difference, as far as I can see, is that an IC system is defined as not including the stuff that is not strictly relevant to its function, whereas an HIC system is defined as including such things -- which it then renders irrelevant to any subsequent argument about the evolution or design of the system in question anyway, by not bothering with them! Those irrelevant parts aren't the point of contention anyway!\n \n So I continue to see no meaningful difference between IC and HIC systems. When the chips are down, all we're talking about is IC, and the \"HIC\" idea just introduces an unnecessary point.\n \n \nThe definition of IC says that any part can be removed to remove function, that means there are no parts that aren't necessary.\n\n \n But this is only because IC is defining a given \"system\" in terms of the parts that are necessary to its function in the first place! You're defining the systems more broadly, to include the functionally unnecessary parts, too -- but then the point of debate only concerns the parts that are functionally necessary anyway! So ultimately, it's just IC. The \"hybrid\" point is of no relevance whatsoever.\n \n \nI am using it [\"selection pressure\"] to mean there is selection for, as in if a mutation happens and there is selection pressure for it, it is selected.\n\n \n And this is not how biologists use the term. What you're talking about is the fact of selection itself.\n \n Selection pressure is the collection of various factors that push natural selection to produce a particular result for this or that population of organisms. Those factors do this by selecting for organisms that can adapt to them, and against those that can't.\n \n A simplified example: Over time, a terrestrial land area undergoes long-term climate change, becoming on average 30 degrees celsius cooler. Perhaps the specifics involve continental drift toward the poles, or an increase in elevation, or whatever. Doesn't matter. The point is simply, it's getting colder. This provides selection pressure on the organisms that live there to adapt to the growing cold -- insulated exteriors, antifreeze in circulatory/transport systems, capacity for dormancy, etc. Those organisms that are able to survive and reproduce under the cooling conditions, will be selected for; those that aren't, will be selected against. What you'll wind up eventually, when the climate stabilizes, is organisms that are capable of surviving and reproducing under much cooler conditions than previously. There was selection pressure for cold-adapted features, and those organisms that are left have them.\n \n \nIntegrating over time means you consider the selection pressure at every point in time.\n\n \n Doesn't the above example? (Didn't the original bacterial flagellum example?)\n \n \nUsing the word chance in the context that I am, means that no process can be 'by chance'. The evolutionary process is a process.\n \n\n \n So you're defining \"chance\" away? Yeesh. What is your definition of \"chance?\"\n \n \nIf I had a dime...\n\n \n Did it ever occur to you that all those dimes have accumulated because you really don't understand what so many people have said you don't understand?\n \n Please note, when I pointed out that I didn't think you understood how natural selection worked, I proceeded to explain precisely what I thought was the misunderstanding. I did so without insulting your intelligence, as I do not believe that misunderstanding is an indicator of any lack thereof. So don't take it personally, please.\n \n After all, you told me I need to consider your concept of HIC more deeply. It didn't offend me. I tried. And I now think I understand it much better than I did. I still don't buy it, of course -- just as you don't have to buy the received view of how natural selection works. But right now, I don't think you understand that received view. And I've explained why.\n \n \nLook how does one go from making a statement which everyone agrees is correct about a fact of natural selection to not understanding natural selection?\n\n \n But which \"fact of natural selection\" was that? I've been looking back through things, and I can't find it. What I said was correct was the notion that mutations are random. What I also said was correct was the notion that natural selection can act on mutations -- though all it really needs is variation, not necessarily mutation (unless sexual recombination is ipso facto \"mutation,\" I suppose). It remains the case that you seem to construe \"natural selection according to the received view\" as involving much more randomness and chance than it does.\n \n Apologies if that's not what you were on about, but I've looked high and low, and I can't figure out what your referent was.\n \n \nCo-option, those proposed limbs which gave flight could not do so under the selection pressure for flight.\n\n \n Those limbs are the outcome of the selection pressure.\n \n \nIn other words selection for flight was not the selection pressure that caused formation.\n\n \n The selection pressure for flight is what, in the long run, produces flying wings. It's not mutually exclusive of all other selection pressures along the way -- e.g. a pressure for gliding wings, say.\n \n \nThere is no role for chance (or should not be).\n\n \n Why not? This seems entirely arbitrary, at best.\n \n Moreover, mutations are \"chance\" events: events that cannot be predicted at the level of their individual occurrence.\n \n \nIf a mutation is in the realm of possibility (that's an odds calculation) it can be assumed to be possible for evolution.\n\n \n I do not understand what this means.\n \n \nThey changed after you hand-waved function into existance.\n\n \n How did I hand-wave anything at all? In reality, selection pressures confronting any given organism change over time. In my narrative portraying the possibility of the evolution of the flagellum, I merely took account of that.\n \n Selection pressure A helps maintain function X. Selection pressure B makes function X unnecessary. Selection pressure C drives the evolution of function Y, using the structure that had once been used for function X.\n \n Such was the basic structure of my narrative. It accounts for selection pressures over time. What's the hand-wave?\n \n \nYou people don't seem to be getting my response to this sort of comment, let's see how else can I put it...\n \n \"Bla, Bla.... Bla\"\n \n I don't and shouldn't care about your assertions about my ignorance if you cannot provide even one example of a premise I hold that is wrong.\n\n \n And what I have in every instance tried to do is point out exactly what I think you don't understand.\n \n Apparently, accompanying such statements by saying \"You don't understand\" is offensive to you. For my part, I do not understand why. The subsequent comments make more sense (in terms of their pragmatics) when preceded by a statement to indicate the purpose of those comments, i.e., to correct what I regard as a misunderstanding.\n \n How is it any different than you telling me to think about something more?\n \n \nThen you will have to make an argument as to the existance of co-option in specific relation to the isolation of functional sequences.\n\n \n That's exactly right. It's also exactly what evolutionary biologists do.\n \n \n \nVery good, this is where I left off with peeling, I await your response eagerly.\n\n \n What response? I don't understand what you're asking for.\n \n \nWhich is why it is incorrect.\n\n \n Huh? I had just said that natural selection is the opposite of luck. It's not just some chance process by which a few organisms happen to get lucky.\n \n For a great example of how natural selection works, see the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant on the Galapagos finches, as brilliantly chronicled in Weiner's The Beak of the Finch. Which individuals survive and reproduce is not a matter of getting lucky.\n \n What I find really perplexing here -- the reason for my \"Huh?\" -- is that you just said that chance should play no role! I realize that \"luck\" and \"chance\" are not synonyms. But whether we're talking about luck or chance, natural selection is a process that doesn't work along those lines.\n \n So I would think that the idea of natural selection not being a matter of luck would be consistent with your view. This statement, however, makes me uncertain as to what your view is. I'm not sure I understand your position anymore.\n \n \nIt's a misnomer, guided genetic change is what it should be called.\n\n \n What what should be called? I said mutations are not guided. What should be called \"guided genetic change?\" What is \"it?\"\n \n And what does the \"guiding?\"\n \n [QUOTE]Rational evolution does [acknowledge the impossibility of spontaneously generated complexity]...\n \n This is exactly what evolution by natural selection acknowledges!!!\n \n Richard Dawkins, for example, has said repeatedly that complex structures and functions don't \"just happen.\" They need explanations in terms of something other than chance. And this is exactly what evolution by natural selection provides: natural selection is not a chance process. To say this, however, is not to say that natural selection is \"guided.\"\n \n It's starting to appear as if you hold the following view: \"The only way something is not chance is if it's guided by an intelligent or rational agency of some kind.\" Is that what you think? And if so, what is your justification for it?\n \n \nIf you were expecting IC to claim that any given mutation can't happen or that any given co-option can't happen you were mistaken.\n \n Just mutation and just co-option are random and cannot compose the evolutionary concept.\n\n \n Why do you think that co-option is \"random?\"\n \n \nSelection must negate randomness and produce pattern.\n\n \n And it does -- even according to the very model that you are attempting to criticize!!! Forgive me, but this is exactly the sort of comment that leads me to believe you don't understand what natural selection is: You're criticizing it for failing to do what it in fact does!\n \n \nWhat you still have not gotten...\n\n \n A quick thought here, Freedom: Why is it okay for you to tell me that I don't get something, but not for me to tell you that you don't get something?\n \n Should I just consider this nothing more than \"blah blah blah?\" Or should I perhaps consider the possibility that indeed, there is something I don't get?\n \n \n \nthe 'beef' of what IC (the argument) is talking about, the actual part that is not and cannot be evolution is:\n \n \"Eventually, however, a fortunate strain of the baceterium undergoes a mutation that does code for the organelle, and yields a significant modification -- a modification that for a change has a positive impact on survival and reproduction. The former secretory system lengthens and can provide locomotion.\"\n \n This is the hand waved production of function, I see no mention of selection pressures, time or any other of the answers I have asked for.\n\n \n You're right. That's not evolution. It's beneficial mutation. About which, I have two further things to say.\n \n First, such mutations do happen. They are uncommon. Far more mutations are detrimental or neutral. It's a truth about which Aristotle was correct (albeit in an entirely different context): There are many ways to miss a target, and only one (or very few, anyway) to hit it. Nonetheless, beneficial mutations are a rare but real feature of living systems.\n \n Second, the process of natural selection goes to work on precisely those mutations, and -- entirely non-randomly -- such mutations begin to spread through the populuations of the organisms that possess them. Because there are factors that make the mutation beneficial, it will get passed on. As long as those factors persist, the mutation will continue to get passed on, and it will spread. Those factors are the selection pressure, which pushes the evolution of the population in a certain direction, viz. possession of what started as a mutation.\n \n So with respect to that example: if the bacterium possesses a structure that mutates by lengthening, and if the circumstances are such that this longer structure is useful, the longer structure will spread. If an even longer structure could be even more useful, and the genetic possibility of greater length exists, than as long as the circumstances persist, the structure will get longer.\n \n You say this doesn't involve selection pressure? Sorry, but I say this is the very essence of how selection pressure works. Conditions push evolution in a given direction rather than another.\n \n \nThe system is irreducible as in you cannot reduce it's complexity without losing it's function....\n\n \n But then -- and I mean this in all seriousness -- so what?!? This just means that starting from complexity, reducing that complexity breaks it. This has no bearing at all on how that complexity did or didn't evolve from (relative) simplicity.\n \n And that's my point, in a nutshell: The fact that a complex system can break, doesn't mean it can't evolve.\n \n \nI am calling any single or string of unselected mutations random, therefore any positive result spontaneously generated.\n\n \n I don't think this is true, even for an individual organism. Because even for them, whether or not a mutation proves \"positive\" is not a matter of chance. It's determined by a whole host of environmental factors.\n \n And these factors will further determine whether or not, and how fast, the mutation spreads through the population. Again, it won't happen by chance.\n \n \nYes if you change the function the selection pressure changes, but how do you change the function without changing the selection pressure?\n \n (random!)\n\n \n What is random here?\n \n Frankly, you seem to have understood me backwards. I am trying to point out that, as selection pressures change, what counts as a useful function changes, too. And there is nothing at all random about that!\n \n As climate cools (for example), functions like being able to retain internally generated warmth (for example) or survive freezing (for another) become more useful. Let's isolate three points: 1) Whether a given individual develops such a capacity -- even minimally? Random (i.e., unpredictable, unpatterned). 2) But whether the capacity is useful? Not random. 3) Whether it spreads through a population? Again, not random.\n \n 3 is natural selection. 2 is selection pressure. 1 is just mutation.\n \n You seem to be imputing randomness to 3. But that is simply not what the generally accepted model of evolution that you are trying to criticize says in the first place.\n \n Which is to say: You have misunderstood the concept of natural selection and how it works.\n \n Sorry if that's offensive for some reason, but I call 'em as I see 'em. Along the way, I have made not a single personal attack, and I have explained to the best of my ability the nature of the (alleged) misunderstanding. It's possible that I'm wrong, of course. But I would hope this strikes you as considerably more than just \"blah blah blah.\"",

   "1) you argued both ID and IC, i named the two novel examples of IC and drew an illustration of how they could have evolved. your argument against this was that in the case of the eye, it is HIC because the retina is IC.\n\n No, you never showed they could evolve. I pointed out it was HIC when you called it IC, and it is a lie to say I argued for ID.\n \n My argument against your so called illustration was pointing out that it asserted the evolution of any IC structure it claimed to illustrate as opposed to showing how it could evolve.\n \n \n2) in the case of both retina and flagellum, i was able to show you that although they did not share a common function with the original features they evolved from, natural selection still selected those co-opted features for sheer benefit of the organism. i gave you numerous examples of how a feature could have co-opted via directional selection (a branch of natural selection) and you fought back saying that there is no selection pressure for a function that does not exist.\n\n You gave numerous examples of proposed co-option producing an IC system, you never gave an example of natural selection producing co-option and I maintain that you cannot.\n \n \ni even named you a second selection pressure that could have produced co-option, disruptive selection which separates the function of a multi-functioning feature and makes those two functions independent (ie. bacterial syringe vs flagellum). \n\n and how does two functions being converted to two functions mean a new function?\n \n By already starting out with function you have bypassed IC, it is co-option but after any evolution events have produced it. (assuming that both functions didn't evolve concurrently).\n \n \nthese are two selection pressures within natural selection that follow a change in environment and can produce co-option.\n\n Prove it.\n \n \n4) you then stated that selection pressure needed a selection event to happen\n\n A miswording if I did, a selection pressure never effects a species without selection events. Selection events require selection pressure and benefit.\n \n \nanyways, im happy to continue this debate\n\n Even though I asked first and you have not answered I have responded, it will not happen again.\n \n Answer my questions.\n \n just not about \"selection event\" (im still waiting for that email). in regards to our discussion so far, neither one of us are in the position to say who is right and who is wrong, so as much as i dread bringing a third party into an evo vs create conversation to moderate (to formally debate a creationist is to flatter him into thinking his idea is scientifically legitimate), if anyone has read the conversation thus far and wishes to post an opinion, please do so, especially if you are neutral on the subject.\n\n If you don't think a formal debate is proper then that may explain all the rhetoric.\n \n I am willing to debate you in the formal debate forum.\n \n \nwhat is the difference between \"any\" and \"one or more?\"\n\n Any means you can choose any component to remove and it will remove function.\n \n One or more means that there need only be a specific part(s) to remove before removal of function.\n \n You can find a part to remove that will not remove function in a HIC system but not in an IC system.\n \n \nIn logic, the former is universal, while the latter is particular. But per your usage above, that doesn't seem to be what's going on here.\n\n That is what is meant.\n \n \nThe only difference, as far as I can see, is that an IC system is defined as not including the stuff that is not strictly relevant to its function, whereas an HIC system is defined as including such things \n\n Yes\n \n \nwhich it then renders irrelevant to any subsequent argument about the evolution or design of the system in question anyway, by not bothering with them!\n\n The reason I coined the term is to show how absurd it is to think the implications of IC go away because there are irrelevant parts sitting around.\n \n \nThose irrelevant parts aren't the point of contention anyway!\n\n On the contrary the official critique of IC is basically an argument with an example showing an HIC system reducing to an IC system to show how an IC system can evolve.\n \n It is basically implied that the miscellaneous parts can be removed so that means that the necessary parts are no longer necessary? A non-sequitur for sure but one made in honest misunderstanding I think.\n \n \nSo I continue to see no meaningful difference between IC and HIC systems. When the chips are down, all we're talking about is IC, and the \"HIC\" idea just introduces an unnecessary point.\n\n Well there is one crucial point, that is all system contain an IC core.\n \n \nBut this is only because IC is defining a given \"system\" in terms of the parts that are necessary to its function in the first place! You're defining the systems more broadly, to include the functionally unnecessary parts, too -- but then the point of debate only concerns the parts that are functionally necessary anyway! So ultimately, it's just IC. The \"hybrid\" point is of no relevance whatsoever.\n\n That is true, it was an idea to combat a misconception.\n \n \nWhat you're talking about is the fact of selection itself.\n\n Yes, as well as the concept of it's individual occurrences.\n \n You will never be able to convince me the definitions of selection and event don't support that which is why I asked for an official ulterior definition (still waiting for the email).\n \n \nSelection pressure is the collection of various factors that push natural selection to produce a particular result for this or that population of organisms.\n\n That's how I was using the term but then bennedict indirectly pointed out that if something did appear it would be selected for if it was beneficial regardless of how it got there. This is well known to me of course but it does mean that there was a selection pressure for that system already there, merely missing a structure to select.\n \n So I am now using about the same definition minus the part about actually 'pushing' or changing the genome.\n \n \nA simplified example: Over time, a terrestrial land area undergoes long-term climate change, becoming on average 30 degrees celsius cooler. Perhaps the specifics involve continental drift toward the poles, or an increase in elevation, or whatever. Doesn't matter. The point is simply, it's getting colder. This provides selection pressure on the organisms that live there to adapt to the growing cold -- insulated exteriors, antifreeze in circulatory/transport systems, capacity for dormancy, etc. Those organisms that are able to survive and reproduce under the cooling conditions, will be selected for; those that aren't, will be selected against. What you'll wind up eventually, when the climate stabilizes, is organisms that are capable of surviving and reproducing under much cooler conditions than previously. There was selection pressure for cold-adapted features, and those organisms that are left have them.\n\n Yes\n \n \nDoesn't the above example? (Didn't the original bacterial flagellum example?)\n\n No, you have to be structure specific if you are well being structure specific.\n \n If there is a selection pressure for cold-resistance or for motility it will not result in any selection events unless a mutation actually provides benefit in one of those directions.\n \n The selection pressure may exist for anti-freeze or a flagellum but not for non-functional versions of both that are only to our conceptualizing mind steps towards the new functions.\n \n That is what I meant by integrating over time, you consider the possible selections at every point of development.\n \n For cold resistance consider fur, at what point would longer hair help keep you warmer?\n \n At every point, anything that increases hair length would be selected. What if it had to be 51cm or else no benefit?\n \n Would a mutation for 42 be selected? No.\n \n What about 50? No.\n \n Now that is a bad example in this last sense because longer hair is not biochemically more complex than shorter hair. The mutations that change the length are probably all over the place in what change they make.\n \n In the case of complex systems though the bar would be a minimum function which would require more than just scale.\n \n \nSo you're defining \"chance\" away? Yeesh. What is your definition of \"chance?\"\n\n the absence of any cause of events that can be predicted, understood, or controlled: often personified or treated as a positive agency\n \n A theory is also a prediction, you cannot predict the unpredictable.\n \n Evolution does not try to predict random mutations, yet I have seen many evolutionist try to use selection to predict co-option when it is incapable.\n \n One cannot have a theory that dice will always land on 4 every role, one can have a theory that it will given enough rolls but that is all.\n \n \nDid it ever occur to you that all those dimes have accumulated because you really don't understand what so many people have said you don't understand?\n\n Yes\n \n \nPlease note, when I pointed out that I didn't think you understood how natural selection worked, I proceeded to explain precisely what I thought was the misunderstanding. I did so without insulting your intelligence, as I do not believe that misunderstanding is an indicator of any lack thereof. So don't take it personally, please.\n\n I do not, but I also do not remember this explanation. Can you summarize what I misunderstood please?\n \n \nBut which \"fact of natural selection\" was that?\n\n That there must be a net benefit or detriment.\n \n \nWhat I said was correct was the notion that mutations are random.\n\n They are random with respect to order or functional sequences.\n \n \nWhat I also said was correct was the notion that natural selection can act on mutations -- though all it really needs is variation, not necessarily mutation (unless sexual recombination is ipso facto \"mutation,\" I suppose). \n\n ....\n \n \nIt remains the case that you seem to construe \"natural selection according to the received view\" as involving much more randomness and chance than it does.\n\n Natural selection includes no randomness.\n \n \nThose limbs are the outcome of the selection pressure.\n\n For hunting or manipulation but not for flying.\n \n \n \nThe selection pressure for flight is what, in the long run, produces flying wings. It's not mutually exclusive of all other selection pressures along the way -- e.g. a pressure for gliding wings, say.\n\n The selection pressure for both flight and gliding could not affect the DNA before those functions existed.\n \n \nWhy not? This seems entirely arbitrary, at best.\n\n There is always a chance of something happen, the possibility of is not positive evidence.\n \n It is possible in the strict sense of the word to go from prokaryote to human in a single mutation.\n \n Why wouldn't Darwin or Dawkins stop there? Why wouldn't I accept that as a theory?\n \n \nMoreover, mutations are \"chance\" events: events that cannot be predicted at the level of their individual occurrence.\n\n and evolution does not require that they are predictable, all that matters is that after they are filtered by natural selection the inherited genetic changes over the long run are predictable.\n \n \n\n I do not understand what this means.\n\n If a mutation is a 1/10^50 and there are 1/10^40 mutations in the history of earth, the mutation is practically impossible. Just because it is strictly possible does not mean it is sound to assume it would appear and be selected for.\n \n If a mutation is 1/10^5 and there are 1/10^7 mutation events it is not practically impossible.\n \n \n\n How did I hand-wave anything at all? In reality, selection pressures confronting any given organism change over time. In my narrative portraying the possibility of the evolution of the flagellum, I merely took account of that.\n\n The selection pressure for motility only applied after it became a functional flagellum.\n \n That is hand waving the formation of the flagellum.\n \n \nSelection pressure A helps maintain function X. Selection pressure B makes function X unnecessary. Selection pressure C drives the evolution of function Y, using the structure that had once been used for function X.\n\n C can drive the evolution of function Y if X has the ability to perform Y.\n \n X = Y\n \n = Circular logic.\n \n \n \n=Matthew;414999That's exactly right. It's also exactly what evolutionary biologists do.\n\n I will be waiting for an evolutionary biologist then.\n \n \nHuh? I had just said that natural selection is the opposite of luck. It's not just some chance process by which a few organisms happen to get lucky.\n\n Which is why it is incorrect to treat luck as equivalent to a predictable process like the mechanism of evolution.\n \n Remember\nWhy not? This seems entirely arbitrary, at best.\n\n \n \nWhat I find really perplexing here -- the reason for my \"Huh?\" -- is that you just said that chance should play no role! I realize that \"luck\" and \"chance\" are not synonyms. But whether we're talking about luck or chance, natural selection is a process that doesn't work along those lines.\n\n Indeed\n \n \nSo I would think that the idea of natural selection not being a matter of luck would be consistent with your view. This statement, however, makes me uncertain as to what your view is. I'm not sure I understand your position anymore.\n\n You understood it before apparently.\n \n \n \nWhat what should be called? I said mutations are not guided. What should be called \"guided genetic change?\" What is \"it?\"\n\n The guided mutation test that I invented.\n \n \nAnd what does the \"guiding?\"\n\n Natural selection.\n \n \nRational evolution does [acknowledge the impossibility of spontaneously generated complexity]...\n\n I know.\n \n \nThis is exactly what evolution by natural selection acknowledges!!!\n\n I know.\n \n While we are operating on this frequency, let me say that IC is saying that what lack natural selection cannot be evolved.\n \n \nRichard Dawkins, for example, has said repeatedly that complex structures and functions don't \"just happen.\" They need explanations in terms of something other than chance. And this is exactly what evolution by natural selection provides: natural selection is not a chance process. To say this, however, is not to say that natural selection is \"guided.\"\n\n Genetic change is guided, not selection.\n \n \nIt's starting to appear as if you hold the following view: \"The only way something is not chance is if it's guided by an intelligent or rational agency of some kind.\" Is that what you think? And if so, what is your justification for it?\n\n No.\n \n \nWhy do you think that co-option is \"random?\"\n\n In order for it to be coherent there would need to be an underlying pattern to the 'vector space' of all possible DNA sequences, specifically that cause the intersection of vectors that is not the result of blind luck (because we can infer the density of functional sequences via the ratio of beneficial, neutral and detrimental mutations.\n \n \nAnd it does -- even according to the very model that you are attempting to criticize!!! Forgive me, but this is exactly the sort of comment that leads me to believe you don't understand what natural selection is: You're criticizing it for failing to do what it in fact does!\n\n I am not 'criticizing' natural selection, I am criticizing the illogical attempts to use it's implications in circumstances where it is definitely impossible to apply.\n \n \n \nA quick thought here, Freedom: Why is it okay for you to tell me that I don't get something, but not for me to tell you that you don't get something?\n\n It's ok for both to say that but leaving it at that is not helpful, and certainly not an argument.\n \n Saying I don't understand natural selection is absurd since I used it to argue IC.\n \n I have defined it several times and no one has had a serious objection to my definitions.\n \n On the other hand you were comparing a rotary secretory system to a limb, leading me to think you did not know what a rotary secretory system is.\n \n\n Should I just consider this nothing more than \"blah blah blah?\" Or should I perhaps consider the possibility that indeed, there is something I don't get?\n\n Depends on if you get it.\n \n \n \n \nYou're right. That's not evolution. It's beneficial mutation. About which, I have two further things to say.\n\n \n \nFirst, such mutations do happen.\n\n Nothing like that number of base pairs has ever been observed.\n \n \nSecond, the process of natural selection goes to work on precisely those mutations, and -- entirely non-randomly -- such mutations begin to spread through the populuations of the organisms that possess them. \n\n and I have never said that a novel system will not be preserved once it is formed.\n \n \nSo with respect to that example: if the bacterium possesses a structure that mutates by lengthening, and if the circumstances are such that this longer structure is useful, the longer structure will spread. If an even longer structure could be even more useful, and the genetic possibility of greater length exists, than as long as the circumstances persist, the structure will get longer.\n\n and if longer for what ever function it is now doing also means that it is getting closer to a non-existent function like swimming, what causes that?\n \n The response I believe is inevitable would be 'nothing it just is that way'.\n \n and that is what I mean about assuming co-option without reason.\n \n \n \nBut then -- and I mean this in all seriousness -- so what?!? This just means that starting from complexity, reducing that complexity breaks it. This has no bearing at all on how that complexity did or didn't evolve from (relative) simplicity.\n\n The bearing would be that if it breaks when you remove the part then it was broken before it had that part.\n \n \nI don't think this is true, even for an individual organism. Because even for them, whether or not a mutation proves \"positive\" is not a matter of chance. It's determined by a whole host of environmental factors.\n\n Once you stat talking about positive you are talking about selection, not the mutation itself.\n \n \nWhat is random here?\n\n The coincidence of a function forming structure forming in the absence of selection for that function.\n \n \nFrankly, you seem to have understood me backwards. I am trying to point out that, as selection pressures change, what counts as a useful function changes, too. And there is nothing at all random about that!\n\n The refinements that are possible on the same functional domain are not equivalent to switching functional domains, there is no smooth gradient between them.\n \n 1) Whether a given individual develops such a capacity -- even minimally? Random (i.e., unpredictable, unpatterned). 2) But whether the capacity is useful? Not random. 3) Whether it spreads through a population? Again, not random.\n \n 3 is natural selection. 2 is selection pressure. 1 is just mutation.\n \n \nYou seem to be imputing randomness to 3. But that is simply not what the generally accepted model of evolution that you are trying to criticize says in the first place.\n\n The generally accepted model of evolution is slight gradual steps, accumulating benefit over long periods.\n \n That requires constant selection, as opposed to preserving practicaly impossible mutations.\n \n Yet the IC argument holds, even for the slight gradual steps over long periods individual mutations are not evolved, only the sum is.",

Just as I have said.\n \n \n \n \nthere must be a spelling error here, i assume you mean an existing system, combined with a slight modification can result in a change in function of the system, in which case i will agree to that.\n\n An error of omission there should be a 'switch' after the can and before the 'the'.\n \n \nfor your last question, i used \"encourage\" in replacement for \"produce\" because (i think ive mentioned this before) when you say natural selection, that implies the kill or be killed mentality that is incorrect in defining natural selection, i used \"encourage\" to mean, to personify natural selection, it says 'i will now favour this function after this recent environmental change.' the actual act of selecting comes after the mutation that initiates co-option has somewhat stabalized.\n\n That sounds like a yes but you again insisted on rephrasing.\n \n Natural selection cannot produce the co-option, correct?\n \n You have backed yourself into a corner (or at least recognized the corner you were always in) as you have already said the actual act of selection comes after co-option has allowed a novel system to come into existance.\n \n You did not even try to answer 2 or 3.\n \n \nI just no longer get it. I've read the above post three times. But I don't see what you're trying to argue, about evolution, about natural selection, or about irreducible complexity. I can't tell what we agree or disagree about well enough to say that we should agree to disagree!\n\n It's amazing how repetition of meaningless points blurs arguments isn't it.\n \n I highly doubt you agree with me when I say that no IC system may be evolved because no IC system can be selected for before it exists; and that if it forms before it is selected for, this formation is random with respect to selection.\n \n Since mutation is the only method (yes I am including recombination) for genetic change and natural selection + random mutation is the mechansim of evolution, what is random mutation + natural selection - natural selection?\n \n I consider everything else (everything not about selection pressures but about odds and chances) to be a debate on the chances of spontaneous generation or it's competition co-option.\n \n \nI take IC to say: Consider a complex system that fulfills function x. Parts a, b, and c are necessary for the fulfilment of that function x. Take away b and the system no longer works. Therefore, the system cannot have evolved part b.\n\n Almost correct, but even here the premise of co-option is assumed.\n \n Therefore the system cannot have evolved part b if part b is created via selection pressure for x.\n \n Co-option is saying that part b will exist for because of another selection pressure, a different evolutionary pathway.\n \n The key mistake made here in evolutionist minds is as follows \"well it's not impossible right?\"\n \n Not very much is impossible in biology or chemistry in general, but that is not where one started.\n \n One started with the mechanism of evolution and a positive prediction about patterned filtered genetic change.\n \n What if evolution was just 'random mutation'? Would it still be a theory, I mean it's not impossible to mimic the life history of this planet without selection.\n \n Now in reality there is in almost all cases a z part, which is the control systems; systems that are actually impossible to evolve by a separate evolutionary pathway as they must be specific to the new system.\n \n That alone would be enough fuel to fight co-option but step one is to establish we are talking about co-option here.\n \n if a, b, and c are necessary to accomplish x, and they already exist in the cell, then hasn't function x already evolved?\n \n It would be a gross misconduct to think that one can explain all life systems by assuming they already exist, even if the unanalyzed association events relied upon to weld them into a coherent system are ignored.\n \n \nI take evolution to respond: Even with just a and c, the simpler system can fulfill function y. And if the possession of a and c and the attendant fulfilment of y are beneficial, natural selection will maintain them. If a mutation produces b, the system can now fulfill function x. If the possession of b and the attendant fulfilment of x are beneficial, natural selection will spread b and x across the population. So the system can have evolved part b after all.\n\n You just said if a mutation produces b, you can't evolve a single mutation there are no selection events in the interval of production.",

Later on I mentioned that structures (parts) are not selected in and of themselves, and that its the function the part facilitates that is selected for or against.\n \n \nI'm going to assume you meant 'not the same'.\n\n Well when I say that no two organisms are the same, it would mean that they are not the same.\n \n \nI am not of that opinion, I ignore neutral mutations because by definition they are irrelevant to selection, excluding them from the process of evolution.\n\n Precisely. Ignoring neutral mutations/variations is what many proponents of IR have a habit of doing. However, by doing so you're overlooking a hugely important part of the evolution process. Let's say we overlook variations in finch toes. It is entirely possible for 5-toed finches to be part (a small part) of the finch population. No selection pressure for toe variation exists, so a 5th toe would neither be beneficial nor detrimental to the survival of finches. They would just exist within the population without any directed change in allele frequency.\n \n What would happen if an event took place that caused selection for 5-toed finches to become suddenly greatly favored? We would end up in a scenario where a new species exists, comprising of only 5-toed finches, existed. A whole new species, each with a whole new part! By focusing on the arguments that are common among IC proponents, and not considering the fact that unselected features give rise to new features, a species of 5-toed finches could be potentially baffling as to how they could possibly exist.\n \n \ni.e. selection pressure did not exist, but the structures did.\n \n Selection pressure + Structure with benefit towards the selection pressure = selection = series of selection events.\n\n With the exception of your use of the term \"selection event\", I agree. And I assume that you also agree that selection pressure does not apply to every structure/function, but can also always apply to some structures/functions.\n \n \nCheers! emoticon_xhoho (parade) Thank you unkerpaulie, my hope for humanity is restored!\n \n Now of course in the examples there was selection pressure for the final system, but none for the range of genetic change.\n\n Again we agree. This range of genetic change that undergoes no selection pressure can give rise to variations of features or possibly even entirely new features, that can be \"dormant\" (in evolutionary terms) among the population. In large populations, we would expect to see more variations and an increased chance of randomly generated new features, many of which have no selection pressure. We are talking about randomly generated mutations. We are also talking about an organism that is already thriving in its current state. Variation is essentially not needed, but it occurs anyway because \"thats just how it is\" :p. For the most part, a hugely dramatic variation (which can possibly occur), would necessarily have some form of selection pressure against it, but for the most part slight variations which can give rise to new features or functions are not.\n \n \nDepends on the size of the population and the other selection pressures, if the absolute best finch in the world was g-flat and grey that would get passed on as a package.\n \n Of course the dominant recessive nature of genes means that the unselected genes could sit around in various frequencies imparting their colors and their notes to the birds.\n\n Yup\n \n \nI know.\n \n When a selection pressure does not exist for something yet it is still 'selected' that is random.\n \n I have selected in quotes because it is not a real selection but a coincidence of a real selection with an 'unknowable' benefit, unknowable to NS that is.\n\n I would stay away from coining new terms or redefining existing terms, if thats ok with you. I find that it doesn't go well in the long run. We could say that a feature can be selected for, selected against, or unselected (no pressure, no tendency to either an increase or decrease in frequency).\n \n \nIt is absolutely true that with respect to those things without selection pressures natural selection is random.\n \n If you were a sequence just hoping to mutate to a new sequence, but none of the steps there or even the new sequence gave any benefit to your organism; but natural selection still selected every one of those changes and you got to your new sequence.\n \n Is that luck or was there a reason?\n \n Here is a hint, there cannot be a reason because we already said there was no benefit.\n \n Selection does not operate under absence of benefit.

(well actually it can create structures and features).\n\n Seems like you're saying 2 different things.\n \n \nWhich brings up the error in thought (we are out of evolution or not world and are now in odds world) that is operating in many evolutionists minds.\n \n You cannot continually apply the idea of mutation and natural selection to larger and larger changes.. when you are no longer dealing with mutations but complex parts themselvs.\n\n Even though technically its possible to have random mutations becoming complex new structures free of selection pressure, the odds are that eventually some kind of selection pressure will apply. The greater the variation of a single individual from the rest of the species, the less likely it is to survive within that species, and unless the organism can fit into a new population niche where its mutation is better favored (selection pressure itself), it will not survive beyond its generation at all.\n \n \nIt is well known that individual mutations are not produced by evolution, so what is produced by evolution?\n\n Evolution = random mutation + natural selection. Evolution can produce anything pertaining to organism survival, including the extinction of a species entirely. There are 2 processes at work here that, together, allow the changes in allele frequencies among populations that we can observe.\n \n \nPatterns of genetic change on larger scales than single mutations, the number of selection events determine how patterned it is.\n \n In this way evolution can produce a fluke out of a limb, because there were hundreds if not thousands of beneficial fluke like changes to the limb there were hundreds if not thousands of selected mutations.\n \n Then the foolish mistake comes in and I see people treating hundreds of specific base pairs like a single mutation.\n \n They just come up and are selected afterward, what does it matter if their production wasn't evolution?\n \n Their production is precisely the sort of thing that evolution is needed to explain.\n\n Didn't we just agree that random mutations are responsible for the rise of new features, and, by extention, possible new functions?\n \n \nFunctional proteins of that size do not simply appear.\n \n You cannot say 'well a fluke just appeared and after that it was selected'.\n \n If that were the case I could say 'well people just appeared and since we are so great we were preserved'.\n \n That is the kind of thing fartigle would have a field day with yet it is the logic being used to explain things like a flagellum or an eye.\n \n Bottom line, it is not always practically possible for b to be randomly generated.\n\n Correct. We can't argue that its practically impossible to appear either. The reproductive turnover and population size of an organism affects the chances of a novel mutation arising, as well as the conditions that cause mutations to be more chaotic of more radical. And then when these random mutations arise, natural selection must apply. And even in the case where a variation is unselected or selected against, it may result in a low frequency of that variation but not eliminate it completely. So yes, the odds of an unselected random mutation persisting in an organism's population is indeed slim, but clearly cannot be ruled out of possible.",

   "The first point here is the biggie. The others will hopefully clarify whatever comes in the first.\n \n I.\n \n \nI highly doubt you agree with me when I say that no IC system may be evolved because no IC system can be selected for before it exists...\n\n \n Well, I do object (if only initially) to the notion that any biological system can't be evolved! But I'm afraid we have a bigger problem here: I don't even understand what you mean that an IC system is anymore.\n \n Could we largely start over, where the definition of \"Irreducible Complexity\" is concerned?\n \n A. Instead of talking about an IC system from the outset, describe a biological system, and then please tell me what makes it \"irreducibly complex.\" Give at least one example, preferably two or three.\n \n B. Then explain why such systems cannot evolve -- why their evolution is not possible. Go through the arguments step-by-step, please, because I don't want to miss anything.\n \n I'm sorry to be so simplistic, but I am utterly confused by most of what you write. If you have to compose an answer in a way that strikes you as almost childishly over-simple, please go ahead. I'm completely flummoxed.\n \n II.\n \n \n...what is random mutation + natural selection - natural selection?\n\n \n I have no idea. This is one of those things you write that I just don't follow at all.\n \n What does it mean to both add and subtract natural selection from the equation?\n \n Okay, if we simply don't address natural selection at all, then we're left with mutation. And that's certainly not evolution! But what's the big deal? Nobody says that mutation on its own is evolution!\n \n Like I said, I don't get where you're coming from with this comment.\n \n III.\n \n \nAlmost correct, but even here the premise of co-option is assumed.\n \n Therefore the system cannot have evolved part b if part b is created via selection pressure for x.\n\n \n (\"Therefore?\" Is the second sentence a conclusion drawn in some way from the first? Sorry, I don't follow.)\n \n I didn't say that part b evolved, for the initial possessor. Evolution is not about individual organisms. It's about populations/species. With respect to the individual organism, b was a mutation. If it spreads throughout the population, to the point where it's no longer really a mutation but simply the (or at least, an) ordinary state of affairs -- that is evolution: change in allele frequency within a population.\n \n IV.\n \n \nCo-option is saying that part b will exist for because of another selection pressure, a different evolutionary pathway.\n\n \n But why can't this happen? What is the problem with co-option? You seem to have a major beef with it, and I can't figure out what it is.\n \n V.\n \n \nThe key mistake made here in evolutionist minds is as follows \"well it's not impossible right?\"\n\n \n But nobody says that just because something isn't impossible, it's actual! I do not recall ever seeing any evolutionary biologist argue such a thing. From what I've read, when biologists try to argue for how something did evolve, they don't say anything like could've-happened-so-it-did. They say could've-happened-this-way-so-what's-the-evidence-it-did? Hypothesis, test.\n \n On the other hand, keep in mind -- and perhaps this results in some confusion? -- I have seen arguments against Irreducible Complexity stop far short of the evidence for what actually happened. But this is perfectly fine, for the following reason: Irreducible Complexity is an argument that something is impossible. Look at how you yourself put it above: \"no IC system may be evolved.\" The counter-argument does not have to establish the actual evolutionary pathway: It only needs to demontrate the possibility of such a pathway.\n \n In sum: You're right that it would be preposterous for anyone to claim that a just-so story about an evolutionary pathway is accurate, just because it's conceivable. But IC is making a much stronger claim than that a given pathway didn't happen: it's saying that no such pathway could have happened. All that an evolutionist needs to establish is that a pathway is possible to defeat the argument.\n \n VI.\n \n \nWhat if evolution was just 'random mutation'? ...it's not impossible to mimic the life history of this planet without selection.\n\n \n But then how would the adaptations of organisms to their environments (biotic and abiotic) be explained? As far as I am aware, everyone acknowledges that adaptatoin requires an explanation other than random mutation -- a non-random explanation, an explanation other than mere chance. And this is precisely what natural selection provides.\n \n VII.\n \n \nIt would be a gross misconduct to think that one can explain all life systems by assuming they already exist, even if the unanalyzed association events relied upon to weld them into a coherent system are ignored.\n\n \n But who's saying they already exist? Is that what you think co-option is saying? Is this your problem with it?\n \n If so, I'm afraid I'm still having trouble following you. If a walking forelimb is co-opted into a wing, does this imply that the wing already existed? I think not.\n \n Sorry if I'm misunderstanding, but I can't think of anyone who has ever made the assumption to which you refer. Nor can I think of any aspect of evolutionary biology, including the idea of co-option, that entails it.\n \n VIII.\n \n \nNatural selection produces nothing it preserves things.\n\n \n Or eliminates them, of course! It preserves variations that are beneficial, but eliminates those that are harmful.\n \n In any event... Is your larger point just that natural selection is not itself the source of variation in individual organisms? That's true, of course -- but who claimed otherwise? Variation among individuals is one of the preconditions for natural selection to begin.\n \n Now, natural selection can be the source of variation between one group and another. If they're subject to different selection pressures, different variations will be beneficial. In this sense, natural selection can produce variation among groups, or even among individuals qua members of different groups.\n \n But it isn't the ultimate source of variation among individuals qua members of the same group. Mutation is.\n \n Is that something that you find problematic?\n \n -----\n \n Hopefully your responses will clarify things for me. I'm trying to understand, Freedom! Can't promise that when I do, I'll agree, of course. But hopefully we can at least get to a point where I grasp your position.",

   "Again we agree. This range of genetic change that undergoes no selection pressure can give rise to variations of features or possibly even entirely new features, that can be \"dormant\" (in evolutionary terms) among the population. In large populations, we would expect to see more variations and an increased chance of randomly generated new features, many of which have no selection pressure. We are talking about randomly generated mutations. We are also talking about an organism that is already thriving in its current state. Variation is essentially not needed, but it occurs anyway because \"thats just how it is\" :p. For the most part, a hugely dramatic variation (which can possibly occur), would necessarily have some form of selection pressure against it, but for the most part slight variations which can give rise to new features or functions are not.\n\n \n i was explaining to freedom that if co-option were to happen, it would need a selection event (of which i subscribe the definition as \"a change in environment that causes the selection of certain traits\".) so, lets say there was a change in environment and a largely populated, largely variable organism starts to become selected against because of a certain selection pressure. if that organism developed a mutation that would in any way reduce the negative selection pressure against it, by fulfilling, even slightly, the function required for improved reproductive fitness, directional selection pressure will select for those with that mutation. once directional selection has distributed the variation throughout the population, balancing selection takes over and slight advantageous modifications will improve that function.\n \n there was some confusion as to how a mutation could arise that could change the function of a system, and if you look at these examples, they can be reduced, theoretically to a system with a different function. an example would be the eyespot of a mollusk. its skin cells (like all skin cells) already have light sensative pigment, it literally takes the slightest mutation to increase that sensativity to light to turn skin cells into an eyespot.\n \n so to summarize, if no selection event were to occur, freedom is correct in saying there is no selection pressure for a function that does not exist. however, if the environment were to change to require an organism to have a certain function in order to maintain a certain reproductive fitness standard, and if a current feature with a slight mutation could fulfill that function, it will be selected for.",

Ignoring neutral mutations/variations is what many proponents of IR have a habit of doing.\n\n Hardly, randomness doesn't combine to form non-randomness.\n \n It helps add to this fog that bennedict holds so dear but it cannot matter, it is the direct result of random mutation so why differentiate it from that?\n \n \nHowever, by doing so you're overlooking a hugely important part of the evolution process. Let's say we overlook variations in finch toes. It is entirely possible for 5-toed finches to be part (a small part) of the finch population. No selection pressure for toe variation exists, so a 5th toe would neither be beneficial nor detrimental to the survival of finches. They would just exist within the population without any directed change in allele frequency.\n \n What would happen if an event took place that caused selection for 5-toed finches to become suddenly greatly favored? We would end up in a scenario where a new species exists, comprising of only 5-toed finches, existed. A whole new species, each with a whole new part! By focusing on the arguments that are common among IC proponents, and not considering the fact that unselected features give rise to new features, a species of 5-toed finches could be potentially baffling as to how they could possibly exist.\n\n This is another form of the 'already exists' argument I noted earlier.\n \n So here is a question, if it was randomly produced and sat there without selection, what is the difference between that and being randomly produced after there was selection pressure?\n \n \nWith the exception of your use of the term \"selection event\", I agree. And I assume that you also agree that selection pressure does not apply to every structure/function, but can also always apply to some structures/functions.\n\n Every functioning system has a selection pressure associated with it or else it would not be maintained.\n \n Vestigial organs, the ones we see sitting about are almost all of the variety that cannot be destroyed without destroying some other important system.\n \n Can't break molar genes without breaking teeth genes ect.\n \n \nAgain we agree. This range of genetic change that undergoes no selection pressure can give rise to variations of features or possibly even entirely new features, that can be \"dormant\" (in evolutionary terms) among the population.\n\n I think I understand what you are getting at now, databed also took this approach.\n \n Apparently in his mind it was easier to explain the generation of novel function by thinking of a range of unselected genetic code changing until it simply formed it.\n \n Basically he was saying genetic drift formed the new functions.\n \n He was not able to, but perhaps you could explain how selection figures into this? \n \n \nI would stay away from coining new terms or redefining existing terms, if thats ok with you.\n\n Coining new terms is sometimes the only thing to do, and I don't redefine existing terms.\n \n What sparked that statement here?\n \n \nEven though technically its possible to have random mutations becoming complex new structures free of selection pressure, the odds are that eventually some kind of selection pressure will apply.\n\n The only case where selection pressure for the function in question will apply is if the existing structure is capable of that function; if not you have no idea which direction the sequence will then take because there is no reason this intermediate functions selection pressure to be the same or to be anything for that matter.\n \n \nThe greater the variation of a single individual from the rest of the species, the less likely it is to survive within that species, and unless the organism can fit into a new population niche where its mutation is better favored (selection pressure itself), it will not survive beyond its generation at all.\n\n You should be careful of the organisms you have in mind when you try to analyze things like that.\n \n A typical bacteria does not need to mate or otherwise interact with others of it's species save compete. It's variation and it's benefit are totally internal it's own existance.\n \n \nEvolution = random mutation + natural selection. Evolution can produce anything pertaining to organism survival\n\n Prove it.\n \n \nDidn't we just agree that random mutations are responsible for the rise of new features, and, by extention, possible new functions?\n\n We agree that it's not impossible. I have not seen you explicitly agree that evolution cannot be responsible for the formation of new functions.\n \n \nCorrect. We can't argue that its practically impossible to appear either.\n\n I can, I know ignorance is where evolutionist like to stand on the matter of the fitness landscape but not everyone has that problem.\n \n \nThe reproductive turnover and population size of an organism affects the chances of a novel mutation arising, as well as the conditions that cause mutations to be more chaotic of more radical. And then when these random mutations arise, natural selection must apply. And even in the case where a variation is unselected or selected against, it may result in a low frequency of that variation but not eliminate it completely. \n\n I would be happy to start talking about odds after you have ceded my points on evolution's product.\n \n I have made the mistake of flowing where ever the debate flowed far to often, and have found that after spending a dozen pages and finally getting someone to admit something about the odds of spontaneous (or equivalent odds) generation they just grab the imaginary life line of natural selection and since the typical response of an evolutionist when losing the battle about evolution is to dive into odds the point had not already been proven (to their satisfaction) about evolution and NS.\n \n This swapping of positions can continue until one side has tired so completly of the repetition they quit.\n \n So we are talking about evolution until I hear from your own keyboard that the guided mutation test is what we are going to have to pass before invoking the mechanism of evolution.\n \n \nSo yes, the odds of an unselected random mutation persisting in an organism's population is indeed slim, but clearly cannot be ruled out of possible.\n\n It is ruled out as irrelevant.\n \n \nWell, I do object (if only initially) to the notion that any biological system can't be evolved! But I'm afraid we have a bigger problem here: I don't even understand what you mean that an IC system is anymore.\n \n Could we largely start over, where the definition of \"Irreducible Complexity\" is concerned?\n\n An irreducibly complex system is one in which the removal of any parts removes the function.\n \n I'll save you some time (because this covers 90% of the incorrect 'debunks' of IC) and tell you about HIC, which is a system in which the removal of necessary parts removes the function but not all parts are necessary.\n \n You can I hope clearly see that all systems must fit either IC or HIC, and that all HIC systems have an IC core.\n \n When looking at the arguments against it there are two main themes.\n \n 1. You actually can remove parts and retain function; rebuttal: the function of the system is still lost, it is another one that exists then.\n \n 2. Here is system A which you can remove parts and now here is system B which evolved from system A (illustration is given) and it is now IC, that means IC is not evolvable; Rebuttal: The system it evolved from must always be HIC, meaning the IC core did not evolve, it merely made somethings necessary or removed some things.\n \n \nA. Instead of talking about an IC system from the outset, describe a biological system, and then please tell me what makes it \"irreducibly complex.\" Give at least one example, preferably two or three.\n\n 1. Flagellum\n 2. Organelles (prokaryote -< eukaryote)\n \n A flagellum is irreducibly complex because the removal of the control systems, the motor, any of the rings, the hook, the filament, or the export apparatus render it incapable of functioning as a flagellum. (I know some have said the hook is enough but I would really like some evidence before I cede to that given the fact that I don't believe a rigid perpendicular to the torque (parallel to the membrane) symmetric object can product thrust via rotation in water).\n \n Organelles in eukaryotes are IC because the failure of any of the control systems for internal membranes would render the whole cell inoperable.\n \n They must be constructed as needed in a certain way with the proper protein complexes in their membranes. A sub example being the nucleus, you must have all the proper exit channels for RNA transport, and signals existing as well as the machinery to build a membrane only around a nucleus.\n \n \nB. Then explain why such systems cannot evolve -- why their evolution is not possible. Go through the arguments step-by-step, please, because I don't want to miss anything.\n\n Not necessarily step by step but selected step by selected step.\n \n A secretory system cannot evolve into a flagellum because no matter what change you choose to do to it, if that change does not turn it into a flagellum it is not selected.\n \n Which means by the time any change towards a flagellum is selected it already exists, it has already been produced and it is a functional flagellum that is being selected.\n \n The concept behind this is guided mutation, a test which evaluates true if there are any selected mutations on the path from A -< B because of the similarity with B.\n \n I contend all true, predictable evolution will pass the guided mutation test, that anything else is by definition unselected and random with respect to B.\n \n This is a dark cloud in the fog that appears to be the concept of evolution held by too many.\n \n I say this because they seem to know enough to avoid it and do not claim that there were any slight mutations that accumulated into a flagellum.\n \n Instead the story is that all the parts existed (why?.... because they were useful themselves... No why were they flagellum parts if they weren't functioning as a flagellum?.... Well uh, it's not impossible so...) and just 'associated' into each other at the same time as the spontaneous generation of control systems after (apparently) a gene duplication or else the secretory system had become obsolete in this protoflagelar cell.\n \n \nI'm sorry to be so simplistic, but I am utterly confused by most of what you write. If you have to compose an answer in a way that strikes you as almost childishly over-simple, please go ahead. I'm completely flummoxed.\n\n Selection + Mutation = YAY!\n \n IC systems beats up selection saying \"YOU CAN'T KNOW WHAT I AM UNTIL I AM WORKING\" = UH OH!\n \n \nOkay, if we simply don't address natural selection at all, then we're left with mutation. And that's certainly not evolution! But what's the big deal? Nobody says that mutation on its own is evolution!\n\n (constructs God throne for Matthew)\n \n \nLike I said, I don't get where you're coming from with this comment.\n\n I am coming from where you just went :)\n \n Exactly what you just said.\n \n \n \n(\"Therefore?\" Is the second sentence a conclusion drawn in some way from the first? Sorry, I don't follow.)\n\n I was modifying a setence in your understand of IC -<\"Therefore, the system cannot have evolved part b. \"\n \n \nI didn't say that part b evolved, for the initial possessor. Evolution is not about individual organisms. It's about populations/species. With respect to the individual organism, b was a mutation. If it spreads throughout the population, to the point where it's no longer really a mutation but simply the (or at least, an) ordinary state of affairs -- that is evolution: change in allele frequency within a population.\n\n You are right, that does fit the official definition of evolution.\n \n In my arguments though I am more concerned with irrational evolution, the evolution which claims to explain the existance of biology as we know it.\n \n The evolution that must attempt to explain not just the prevalence of a benefit but the process of constructing systems.\n \n A change in allele frequencies by itself doesn't even imply that a fluke could evolve from a limb, to do that one would have to basically enter the same conceptual territory that my guided 'mutation' test occupies.\n \n \nBut why can't this happen? What is the problem with co-option? You seem to have a major beef with it, and I can't figure out what it is.\n\n I have beef with trying to explain something by saying it is possible.\n \n That wouldn't pass in any other science, a theory must not only hold that it is possible, but that there is an explanation and therefore a cause.\n \n \nBut nobody says that just because something isn't impossible, it's actual! I do not recall ever seeing any evolutionary biologist argue such a thing. From what I've read, when biologists try to argue for how something did evolve, they don't say anything like could've-happened-so-it-did. They say could've-happened-this-way-so-what's-the-evidence-it-did? Hypothesis, test.\n\n Ah, that is a good point.\n \n Who cares freedom if you say there isn't any reason for co-option to exist, look there is co-option between a secretory system and a flagellum.\n \n This has a lot to do with rules and generals.\n \n It has been said that since IC is an argument based on abstracts it can be defeated by abstract arguments. (true)\n \n but my claim that there is no reason for IC to be counted on, i.e. it's random and rare at best is a generalization, one that could not be defeated by an example.\n \n For instance if I said it was rare and cannot be counted on to win the lottery, in fact to take out a loan for a company whose sole purpose is to play the lottery will fail because it is practically impossible to win that often; and someone came up and told me 'you're wrong, someone won the lottery see'. You I'm sure would admit they are wrong, an exception to an unlikelihood does not prove the unlikelihood.\n \n That being said a secretory system does not have co-option with a flagellum, it has homology with a part of the flagellum.\n \n A perfectly operating secretory system cannot operate as a flagellum or even a severely modified one.\n \n It is a multi co-option that is claimed.\n \n Further at the risk of sounding like fartigle, no one has conducted tests that are possible to us now to see exactly how primitive a flagellum one can construct.\n \n I say even if every part of the functioning flagellum existed in the genome with in 99% of the current coding a flagellum would still not appear because the control and construction system is not there, the actual wizard behind the 'association' curtain.\n \n \nOn the other hand, keep in mind -- and perhaps this results in some confusion? -- I have seen arguments against Irreducible Complexity stop far short of the evidence for what actually happened. But this is perfectly fine, for the following reason: Irreducible Complexity is an argument that something is impossible. Look at how you yourself put it above: \"no IC system may be evolved.\" The counter-argument does not have to establish the actual evolutionary pathway: It only needs to demontrate the possibility of such a pathway.\n \n In sum: You're right that it would be preposterous for anyone to claim that a just-so story about an evolutionary pathway is accurate, just because it's conceivable. But IC is making a much stronger claim than that a given pathway didn't happen: it's saying that no such pathway could have happened. All that an evolutionist needs to establish is that a pathway is possible to defeat the argument.\n \n\n You are correct, the thing that you will discover though is that after you remove every mistake from every argument the only ones that still work are the ones that contradict the mechanism of evolution.\n \n In other words I am claiming that any attempt to assemble a pathway to a non-existent system will either be composed of unselected steps or steps that were selected by chance with respect to that system.\n \n \nBut then how would the adaptations of organisms to their environments (biotic and abiotic) be explained?\n\n They could not be, that is my point; it's not a process, a theory, or an explanation.\n \n \nAs far as I am aware, everyone acknowledges that adaptatoin requires an explanation other than random mutation -- a non-random explanation, an explanation other than mere chance. And this is precisely what natural selection provides.\n\n I thought that too before practically every single evolutionist I have ever argued with ended up appealing to odds when faced with the IC argument.\n \n \nBut who's saying they already exist? Is that what you think co-option is saying? Is this your problem with it?\n\n That is basically what co-option is saying and I have already explained my problem with it.\n \n \nIf so, I'm afraid I'm still having trouble following you. If a walking forelimb is co-opted into a wing, does this imply that the wing already existed? I think not.\n\n At the point it switched functions it did exist, and that is the claim that without selection for a wing a limb became capable of minimal flight(including gliding) that is co-option.\n \n I would again like to note that I do not like anatomical features as by there very nature beneficial changes can almost always take the form of scale or location, meaning these are often fully gradiented changes in the growth control of the cells as opposed to a truly IC structure.\n \n \nSorry if I'm misunderstanding, but I can't think of anyone who has ever made the assumption to which you refer. Nor can I think of any aspect of evolutionary biology, including the idea of co-option, that entails it.\n\n If you do not make the assumption I will be glad of it.\n \n \nOr eliminates them, of course! It preserves variations that are beneficial, but eliminates those that are harmful.\n\n You caught me, I was feeling lazy when I was typing that.\n \n It sometimes seems that I actually cause more confusion trying to cover all the angles like that. (notice all the 'provided' and 'give' and 'except in the case of')\n \n \nIn any event... Is your larger point just that natural selection is not itself the source of variation in individual organisms? That's true, of course -- but who claimed otherwise? Variation among individuals is one of the preconditions for natural selection to begin.\n\n Bennedict seemed to in the sentence I was responding to.\n \n \n\n Is that something that you find problematic?\n\n No\n \nHopefully your responses will clarify things for me. I'm trying to understand, Freedom! Can't promise that when I do, I'll agree, of course. But hopefully we can at least get to a point where I grasp your position.\n\n Hopefully, I wish I could be more excited but I feel as if I am starting from square one.\n \n I have had this debate in almost identical form with a dozen evolutionist so far and about two have had an open enough mind to not walk away after the standards tricks didn't work on the IC argument.\n \n One of them was peeling who not only quickly grasped the argument but did not target it and moved straight on to the issue of it's absolute implications in the real world, we actually covered some new ground; Now I am back to fencing off the same frustrated jabs at the basic IC argument.\n \n I am not sure if peeling was very good at understanding my way of communicating or just open minded.\n \n Anyway you are reminding me of him because he told me that every evolutionary biologist knows about what I am saying and that it wouldn't be news to them.\n \n \nthere was some confusion as to how a mutation could arise that could change the function of a system, and if you look at these examples, they can be reduced, theoretically to a system with a different function. an example would be the eyespot of a mollusk. its skin cells (like all skin cells) already have light sensative pigment, it literally takes the slightest mutation to increase that sensativity to light to turn skin cells into an eyespot.\n\n How slight?\n \n \nwell, it is a cost, but in both cases, these organisms would be better at survival if they didnt have these modifications.\n\n Then those modifications would not have been selected.\n \n \nabout the benefits outweighing the costs, i cant see how either has a benefit, the cuttlefish maybe because its poisonous in adulthood, but the young ones have these costs without the poison benefit. if anything, my guess is there arent any benefits, but rather they are evolutionary by-products that were selected for because of their neutrality. ie not coming above ground very often, thus not needing to see, or being poisonous so not having to worry about predators in adulthood.\n\n Neutrality is not selected, do you mean they were bundled with other beneficial mutations?",

Is this because competition for limited food supplies would be detrimental to the species, and do birds hold back \"for the good of their species\"? Such arguments have a fatal flaw: \"cheaters\" that laid as many eggs as possible would reap a higher reproductive success than individuals that voluntarily decreased their clutch size. Over time, cheater genes would spread through a population, and genes for holding-back would become rare.\n \n However, the same phenomenon can be interpreted more plausibly in terms of natural selection at the level of individuals. During droughts, parental birds cannot bring as many insects to their nest and therefore cannot feed and fledge as many chicks as they can when food supplies are more ample. Laying extra eggs means most chicks would die of starvation. Birds can actually leave more surviving offspring to breed in the next generation by laying fewer eggs.\n \n Any individual that sacrifices its own reproductive success for the benefit of a group is at a selective disadvantage within that group to any other individual not making such a sacrifice. Classical selection will always favor individuals that maximize their own selfish reproductive success. Natural selection recognizes only one currency: babies. Although we might wish otherwise, beauty, brains, or brawn need not be favored unless such traits are translated into more offspring than average. If ugly, dumb, weak individuals pass on more genes, those traits will prevail in future generations. \n\n \n a common misconception is that natural selection means \"survival of the fittest\". its displayed in all the TV programs about evolution. however, this is BS. reproductive success is the only thing that matters in natural selection, even if the modifications to do so are not beneficial to the survival of the organism. the term \"fitness\" that youve used deals only with reproductive success. i have not bypassed the definition of natural selection, ive used it correctly.",

   "Hardly, randomness doesn't combine to form non-randomness.\n\n Who said anything about non-randomness?\n \n \nIt helps add to this fog that bennedict holds so dear but it cannot matter, it is the direct result of random mutation so why differentiate it from that?\n\n Random mutations are random mutations. Why would you assume there was a differentiation?\n \n \nThis is another form of the 'already exists' argument I noted earlier.\n \n So here is a question, if it was randomly produced and sat there without selection, what is the difference between that and being randomly produced after there was selection pressure?\n\n No difference in terms of production. A genetic mutation doesn't occur in response to external selection pressure. It occurs randomly. I thought we already established this...\n \n \nEvery functioning system has a selection pressure associated with it or else it would not be maintained.\n\n How do you explain hereditory diseases?\n \n \nVestigial organs, the ones we see sitting about are almost all of the variety that cannot be destroyed without destroying some other important system.\n \n Can't break molar genes without breaking teeth genes ect.\n\n I dont get this. There are lots of animals with teeth and no molars that do fine.\n \n \nI think I understand what you are getting at now, databed also took this approach.\n \n Apparently in his mind it was easier to explain the generation of novel function by thinking of a range of unselected genetic code changing until it simply formed it.\n \n Basically he was saying genetic drift formed the new functions.\n \n He was not able to, but perhaps you could explain how selection figures into this? \n\n Before we go further, recap your definition of function. In the context of this discussion I'm using function to mean the most common or useful application of a biological structure used by the organism.\n \n \nThe only case where selection pressure for the function in question will apply is if the existing structure is capable of that function; if not you have no idea which direction the sequence will then take because there is no reason this intermediate functions selection pressure to be the same or to be anything for that matter.\n\n True. However, evironments and circumstances, and therefore functions change. If the earth were suddenly covered with water, the main functions of our legs would no longer be walking, but swimming, even though no genetic mutation occured. An existing secondary function can become a primary function if there is an event that makes that application more necessary. The fact that structures can carry out multiple functions make the survival of many species possible in the event of such changes.\n \n \nProve it.\n\n Prove what?\n \n \nWe agree that it's not impossible. I have not seen you explicitly agree that evolution cannot be responsible for the formation of new functions.\n\n Evolution is responsible for the creation of new structures. Functions are the applications of the structure in question. If a new structure facilitates a new function, why would I agree that evolution wasn't responsible?\n \n \nI would be happy to start talking about odds after you have ceded my points on evolution's product.\n\n What points are you talking about?\n \n \nI have made the mistake of flowing where ever the debate flowed far to often, and have found that after spending a dozen pages and finally getting someone to admit something about the odds of spontaneous (or equivalent odds) generation they just grab the imaginary life line of natural selection and since the typical response of an evolutionist when losing the battle about evolution is to dive into odds the point had not already been proven (to their satisfaction) about evolution and NS.\n\n Explain how natural selection is imaginary.\n \n \nThis swapping of positions can continue until one side has tired so completly of the repetition they quit.\n \n So we are talking about evolution until I hear from your own keyboard that the guided mutation test is what we are going to have to pass before invoking the mechanism of evolution.\n\n Huh? What guided mutation test? and Why would evolution be contingent on such a test or anything else for that matter?\n \n \nAn irreducibly complex system is one in which the removal of any parts removes the function.\n \n I'll save you some time (because this covers 90% of the incorrect 'debunks' of IC) and tell you about HIC, which is a system in which the removal of necessary parts removes the function but not all parts are necessary.\n \n You can I hope clearly see that all systems must fit either IC or HIC, and that all HIC systems have an IC core.\n \n When looking at the arguments against it there are two main themes.\n \n 1. You actually can remove parts and retain function; rebuttal: the function of the system is still lost, it is another one that exists then.\n \n 2. Here is system A which you can remove parts and now here is system B which evolved from system A (illustration is given) and it is now IC, that means IC is not evolvable; Rebuttal: The system it evolved from must always be HIC, meaning the IC core did not evolve, it merely made somethings necessary or removed some things.\n\n Evolution is just as much about parts changing as it is about parts being added or removed. An existing part of a system can change without it being added or removed. To think that evolution is merely the adding and removing of parts is to not have an understanding of what evolution is. \n \n \nA secretory system cannot evolve into a flagellum because no matter what change you choose to do to it, if that change does not turn it into a flagellum it is not selected.\n\n What if the secretory system changes into a more efficient secretory system? Its not a flagellum. Why wouldn't it be selected?\n \n \nWhich means by the time any change towards a flagellum is selected it already exists, it has already been produced and it is a functional flagellum that is being selected.\n \n The concept behind this is guided mutation, a test which evaluates true if there are any selected mutations on the path from A -< B because of the similarity with B.\n \n I contend all true, predictable evolution will pass the guided mutation test, that anything else is by definition unselected and random with respect to B.\n\n Are A and B referring to functions or structures?\n \n \nSelection + Mutation = YAY!\n \n IC systems beats up selection saying \"YOU CAN'T KNOW WHAT I AM UNTIL I AM WORKING\" = UH OH!\n\n Actually mutation comes first.

It's not putting as many of its metabolic resources as it could to develop a better functioning eye.\n \n \nto get into detail about this subject, i think that both the size of the cuttlefish and the mole rat's blindness are byproducts of another evolutionary mechanism. however, these byproducts have been selected for - dont know why, but in terms of fitness, they are neutral; in terms of survival, they are negative. either way, both are non-beneficial traits that have been selected for.\n\n \n But again, I'm not sure these are simply \"non-beneficial traits.\" Consider the mole rat. It loses vision: cost. It saves metabolic resources: benefit. The benefit outweighs the cost, so loss of eyes is selected for.\n \n I grant you, some individuals might well perish due to lack of eyes, by not avoiding predators vision would've helped them spot. But this clearly isn't such a problem that the species is going extinct. It is, on average across the populations, not a negative thing, even if for this or that individual it has negative consequences.\n \n Meanwhile:\n \n \nthe cuttlefish could have survived much better if it was bigger, but it doesnt need to, nor does it need to camoflage very well, because its poisonous (i think it's blood is poisonous, or its skin or something). it may actually reproduce better if its small, because of the environment that it lives in, it needs to lay its eggs in smaller places.\n\n \n I think the same reasoning applies here. As you say, the cuttlefish doesn't need to be bigger! So it doesn't waste it's energy on becoming so. It spends its metabolics resources on something else -- poison, perhaps? In any event, the cost of its size is offset by something else.\n \n \nregardless, both follow the way natural selection works.\n\n \n Oh, of that I have no doubt at all. I hope that's not what I seemed to argue against! I'm just saying, if a given feature maladapts an organism to its environment, that feature will be selected against. If it's not selected against, there's no reason to consider the feature a negative.\n \n It's sort of like arguments about how human intelligence is not a touchstone by which to measure our biological superiority over other organisms -- an argument which I saw you deftly making at some point in the near past! Intelligence works for us, but it bears heavy metabolic costs (in terms of the brain). Many other organisms do just fine without it, so not having it isn't an unconditionally negative thing.",

But regardless, its a good example of a detrimental trait being selected because the other positive traits were enough to offset the negative ones.\n\n \n well done unkerpaulie. it would be interesting to see the differences in survival rate between the blind mole rat and other mole rats with proper visual function. however, i know that the blind mole rat has a smaller population than some of the other breeds of mole rat... your hypothesis makes a lot of sense, but im not sure if its necessarily accurate to fitness. it would be great to look into this.\n \n about the cuttlefish, ive somewhat retracted that example, because although its size is negative to the survival of the animal, it could be greatly positive to the fitness of it. actually, it doesnt have poison glands if i remember correctly, its skin is poisonous, and only poison develops in adulthood. i also dont know which came first, size or poison, but size is positive to fitness because of the environment it lives in, it can only lay its eggs under the bottom of things - like shells or rocks or something - and since it lives in a part of the ocean that scarcely has anything to lay eggs under, and the things that are there are very small, the cuttlefish has to be smaller in order to get under these things to lay its eggs. and since it needs to be small in order to reproduce, it cannot swim because its cuttlebone is too small. the fact that it cant swim makes it very vulnerable, so i assume it must have developed poison after it became small, to defend itself.",

   "I'm going to home in on what I see as the key issues here, because a lot is becoming much clearer.\n \n \nA flagellum is irreducibly complex because the removal of the control systems, the motor, any of the rings, the hook, the filament, or the export apparatus render it incapable of functioning as a flagellum. (I know some have said the hook is enough but I would really like some evidence before I cede to that given the fact that I don't believe a rigid perpendicular to the torque (parallel to the membrane) symmetric object can product thrust via rotation in water).\n\n \n Take a part away and it may no longer function \"as a flagellum.\" But what if it could function as something else? This is what IC denies, and I don't see why it holds water.\n \n In the first place, systems can perform multiple functions. Just because one function is diminished or even lost, doesn't mean it can't continue to perform others, maybe even more effectively. My hands can perform grasping functions, and fine manipulation. They can also dig in the dirt, which they are much less effective at. Suppose someone loses knuckles. Why would this necessarily effect the digging capacity? I grant you: there is not much selection pressure on humans for digging ability! But if there were, why wouldn't this loss be a good thing, that encouraged the development of further digging ability? Again I grant you: this development wouldn't necessarily happen. Sometimes selection pressures push organisms straight to extinction. But to reiterate the thrust of this paragraph, loss of one function doesn't entail the loss of all function.\n \n In the second place, to say that a flagellum would function worse just because it is now missing a functionally essential part strikes me as irrelevant. The issue for evolution is what happened before. A structure we would describe as a \"partial flagellum,\" and that works much worse than what we know as a \"flagellum,\" might well have worked much better than its precursors. It seems to me that what IC says is that if a structure can't improve survival and reproduction now, it can't have improved survival and reproduction then. But why not? That is:\n \n Why couldn't a even partial flagellum be a gigantic locomotory improvement over its predecessors, even if something that possessed only a partial flagellum now would quickly perish?\n \n I grant you, showing that a partial flagellum could be of any benefit at all is not just a matter that should be taken on faith. It needs to be tested, and I honestly don't know if those tests have been done, or what their outcome is or would be. But you seem to be ruling out the possibility a priori. And that's not justified.\n \n \nOrganelles in eukaryotes are IC because the failure of any of the control systems for internal membranes would render the whole cell inoperable.\n \n They must be constructed as needed in a certain way with the proper protein complexes in their membranes. A sub example being the nucleus, you must have all the proper exit channels for RNA transport, and signals existing as well as the machinery to build a membrane only around a nucleus. \n\n \n Again, this is true now. Why does that mean that it was true before?\n \n It seems to me that there is a major time problem involved with claims of irreducible complexity, insofar as those claims are taken to imply the non-evolbability of what is described as irreducibly complex. Conditions and their resultant selection pressures change over time. What is essential now need not have been essential from the beginning.\n \n \nA secretory system cannot evolve into a flagellum because no matter what change you choose to do to it, if that change does not turn it into a flagellum it is not selected.\n\n \n And I'm afraid this statement seems completely unjustified to me. The subsequent attempt at justification is very weak:\n \n \nWhich means by the time any change towards a flagellum is selected it already exists, it has already been produced and it is a functional flagellum that is being selected.\n\n \n Not so! A change \"towards a flagellum\" could be selected on the basis of some entirely different function, that also happens to provide improved locomotion. This is possible even if the improvement is far from the optimal locomotion ultimately obtained by a full flagellum. It is possible even if the organism doesn't use the change that would provide improved locomotion for locomotion at all!\n \n In any event, it certainly does not have to be a \"functional flagellum\" that is selected, in the sense that flagella function now.\n \n You later ask:\n \n \nwhy were they flagellum parts if they weren't functioning as a flagellum?....\n\n \n The answer is that they weren't \"flagellum parts\" initially. Or at least, they didn't have to be. But this doesn't mean they couldn't have been selected on the basis of some other functionality. One functionality can set up the parts for a system that later takes on another functionality.\n \n You seem to be saying that this is impossible. But you'r not providing any argument at all for why such a thing can't happen. So I don't feel inclined to agree.\n \n Later on:\n \n \nA perfectly operating secretory system cannot operate as a flagellum or even a severely modified one.\n\n \n Why not? Just the claim that it couldn't do this seems a completely unjustified leap to me. Structures can have multiple functions.\n \n Moreover, as far as evolution is concerned, so what? Even if the secretory system did not evolve from a flagellum directly, there's no reason why a flagellum couldn't undergo a whole series of reductions, becoming no longer a flagellum -- perhaps even a non-functional vestige -- and then continue to undergo a series of modifications that yields a secretory system. Or vice versa.\n \n Am I saying that either of these sequences did happen? No! But I am saying that they could have happened. You are claiming that they could not have, and as far as I can see, without any justification whatsoever.\n \n Later still:\n \n \nIn other words I am claiming that any attempt to assemble a pathway to a non-existent system will either be composed of unselected steps or steps that were selected by chance with respect to that system.\n\n \n As for the \"unselected steps\": not all evolution is adaptive. Some of it is selectively neutral, and one of the best known phenomena in this regard is genetic drift. But there is absolutely no reason why a feature that is, at one time, selectively neutral cannot become, at a later time, selectively relevant, either positively or negatively.\n \n If one is going to claim that such a pathway of steps has actually happened, in any particular instance, then one must of course provide evidence. But you seem to think that there's a problem with the whole idea of such a sequence involving non-selected steps. And you don't present any argument for why that's the case.\n \n As for the \"steps that were selected by chance with respect to that system\": for the final system? i.e., for the outcome of all those steps? Well, okay. But there's no chance involved in the selection of the steps themselves. To the extent that they provide benefits, they'll be selected for; to the extent that they provide detriments, they'll be selected against -- at the time of their own existence. What they might do in some far-off future, generations hence, is completely irrelevant. Natural selection is at work in the present, not the future.\n \n On the basis of what you've written, I think IC has some major problems in dealing with change of functionality through time.\n \n And finally:\n \n \nI have had this debate in almost identical form with a dozen evolutionist so far and about two have had an open enough mind to not walk away after the standards tricks didn't work on the IC argument.\n\n \n But as far as I can tell, \"the IC argument\" is making some extremely faulty suppositions, that are at least unjustified.\n \n I mean, I'm sorry if I'm taking you back to square one, but it seems like that's where the problem is.",

   "Who said anything about non-randomness?\n\n I say evolution must be non-random.\n \n \nRandom mutations are random mutations. Why would you assume there was a differentiation?\n\n I don't neither should you.\n \n Genetic drift and the sort are what you seem to think alter my arguments, unselected inherited traits, unselected random mutation accumulating.\n \n \n\n How do you explain hereditory diseases?\n\n As a system not being maintained.\n \n \nBefore we go further, recap your definition of function. In the context of this discussion I'm using function to mean the most common or useful application of a biological structure used by the organism.\n\n I am saying a function is the most abstract action a system can perform and all it's applications fall under it.\n \n \nTrue. However, evironments and circumstances, and therefore functions change. If the earth were suddenly covered with water, the main functions of our legs would no longer be walking, but swimming, even though no genetic mutation occured. An existing secondary function can become a primary function if there is an event that makes that application more necessary. The fact that structures can carry out multiple functions make the survival of many species possible in the event of such changes.\n\n I never contended that a function couldn't optimize for an application.\n \n \nProve what?\n\n \"Evolution can produce anything pertaining to organism survival\" - You\n \n \nEvolution is responsible for the creation of new structures. Functions are the applications of the structure in question. If a new structure facilitates a new function, why would I agree that evolution wasn't responsible?\n\n You should not because evolution is not responsible for the creation of new structures unless it selects mutations that lead to that structures existance.\n \n \nWhat points are you talking about?\n\n Evolution cannot produce IC systems because there is no selection for IC systems before they exist, and production is a process that precedes existance.\n \n \nExplain how natural selection is imaginary.\n\n The lifeline is imaginary, ussualy because we started talking about odds because the evolutionist couldn't hold the position that there was steady selected variation in the case.\n \n \nHuh? What guided mutation test? and Why would evolution be contingent on such a test or anything else for that matter?\n\n The guided mutation test is a conceptual analysis of the mechansim of evolution in the circumstance of creating a functional sequence B from any other sequence A or non-existant sequence.\n \n It is contingent on it because they are the same thing, the guided mutation test merely states explicitly what is left unsaid in the spark of understanding which connects a series of small beneficial changes with the production of advanced systems.\n \n Passing the guided mutation test is equivalent to being evolved, failing it brings the opposite conclusion.\n \n @Bennedict, why should evolution follow these rules? Because these rules are the terms of evolution, of the explaination. You cannot raise a spectre process call it science and then say it does whatever the hell it wants unbound by any force or law.\n \n For one thing it's not very original (points to the bible).\n \n The only way I am constraining evolution is by the definition of the terms of it's own universally accepted mechanism (or at least I thought universally before you started talking about NS's magical powers on neutral fitness).\n \n \nWhat if the secretory system changes into a more efficient secretory system? Its not a flagellum. Why wouldn't it be selected?\n\n It would be.\n \n \nAre A and B referring to functions or structures?\n\n Genetic sequences.\n \n \nYou got any examples of newly created structures that don't work?\n\n Nope, You got any examples of yet uncreated structures that do?\n \n \na trait doesn't have to be specifically selected for in order for it to persist in a population.\n\n A trait must be specifically selected in order to be specifically selected.\n \n If you agree with that then you must disagree with bennedicts claims:\n \n \nyes, and that can lead to negative traits. what im saying with the cuttlefish and the mole rat is there are no benefits that could produce these 'costs'. both cuttlefish size and mole rat's eyes are selectable traits, not just sidecars to beneficial traits. natural selection will either select for or against them, and in these cases, they were selected for for whatever reason.\n\n \n \nwell done unkerpaulie. it would be interesting to see the differences in survival rate between the blind mole rat and other mole rats with proper visual function. however, i know that the blind mole rat has a smaller population than some of the other breeds of mole rat... your hypothesis makes a lot of sense, but im not sure if its necessarily accurate to fitness. it would be great to look into this.\n \n about the cuttlefish, ive somewhat retracted that example, because although its size is negative to the survival of the animal, it could be greatly positive to the fitness of it. actually, it doesnt have poison glands if i remember correctly, its skin is poisonous, and only poison develops in adulthood. i also dont know which came first, size or poison, but size is positive to fitness because of the environment it lives in, it can only lay its eggs under the bottom of things - like shells or rocks or something - and since it lives in a part of the ocean that scarcely has anything to lay eggs under, and the things that are there are very small, the cuttlefish has to be smaller in order to get under these things to lay its eggs. and since it needs to be small in order to reproduce, it cannot swim because its cuttlebone is too small. the fact that it cant swim makes it very vulnerable, so i assume it must have developed poison after it became small, to defend itself.\n\n Retract your contradiction.\n \n \nthis is true. when i made the claim that these negative traits exist, i was referring to negativity towards the survival of the animal - i did not consider fitness at the time and i was incorrect in stating they were neutral in regards to fitness.\n\n Thank you.\n \n \nif i scrounge long enough i might be able to come up with another example that is neutral to fitness, but i dont have the time right now. im certain they do exist, because its in the explanation of natural selection, and youve supported this correctly.\n\n Not one that is selected you will not.

   "Take a part away and it may no longer function \"as a flagellum.\" But what if it could function as something else?\n\n What if it could?\n \n \nThis is what IC denies, and I don't see why it holds water.\n\n I don't deny it nor does Behe. It doesn't effect the subsequent logic.\n \n Take that thinking to the extreme to easily see why: All structures are in the end coded for by base pairs. Take away everything but adenine, is adenine used in other structures? Yep, well that means what?\n \n \nIn the first place, systems can perform multiple functions.

It needs to be tested, and I honestly don't know if those tests have been done, or what their outcome is or would be.\n\n With our level of technology it is quite possible to do just that. We can selectively remove or modify practically any part of the flagellum we want and see what happens.\n \n There is a reason why scientist haven't done this and I will tell you why in a second.\n \n \nBut you seem to be ruling out the possibility a priori. \n\n The reason I can rule out such a possibility is that the structure of the flagellum is not on the functional domain of any claimed precursor. By the time it was working in any cell in history it would be pretty much what we see today.\n \n That means we are not just calling something necessary in the context of modern competition but necessary period.\n \n Have scientist tried to remove the signal control system on a flagellum and watched it kill the cell as it keeps moving the cell regardless of food, cytoplasm ion levels, or anything else?\n \n Have scientist tried to remove the hook and see a nice spinning rod? (assuming it would even assemble)\n \n Have scientist tried to remove the filament and see nothing happen?\n \n Have scientist tried to remove the motor and see nothing happen? Have scientist tried to remove any of the rings and see nothing happen?\n \n That however is not relevant to the actual logic of IC, what if there were significantly less functional forms of the flagellum?\n \n Would it still function as a flagellum? Yes it would.\n \n Well how far could this go?\n \n Back to minimal function, alright we are here minimal function now what?\n \n I say that the fallacy (and the actual practical impossibility varies from case to case) is to then attempt to hook up this minimal function with another system because no matter what system is chosen; by the laws demanded by natural selection itself, that system will have had no pressure towards this minimal function which means it's transformation into it is a coincidence, a piece of luck.\n \n That breaks the chain of process, it is not merely one random element being filtered like is the case with random mutation but in fact the entire evolution of the previous system being dragged into a post hoc position of being a pre-cursor but without any selective justification as there always is in true evolution.\n \n If you imagine all the functional forms of system A and all the functional forms of system B linked to themselves by the small changes in between them as strings.\n \n Then saying that there are many beneficial less advanced forms is like saying this string is long.\n \n You can move these strings all over the place on an imaginary plane of possible genetic sequences, there are no laws saying that they must be this direction or that direction.\n \n What evolutionist do though is they drag the strings to meet each other, claiming that this is the way it must have been but without reason to say why they are expected to intersect besides 'if evolution is true this must be true'.\n \n \nAnd that's not justified.\n\n The abstract logic is justified, what is not always justified is whether spontaneous unevolved formation is impossible.\n \n In the case of a flagellum it is well justified.\n \n \nAgain, this is true now. Why does that mean that it was true before?\n\n The fact that cells had DNA and RNA then means it was true then.\n \n \nIt seems to me that there is a major time problem involved with claims of irreducible complexity, insofar as those claims are taken to imply the non-evolbability of what is described as irreducibly complex. Conditions and their resultant selection pressures change over time. What is essential now need not have been essential from the beginning.\n\n Yet something must have been essential in the beginning, at what point can you stop the chain of 'this must have already existed'?\n \n \n \nAnd I'm afraid this statement seems completely unjustified to me. The subsequent attempt at justification is very weak:\n\n I am afraid I have nothing to say to that. Perhaps you could give a modification to a secretory system that is selected due to similarity with a flagellum before the flagellum existed?\n \n \nNot so! A change \"towards a flagellum\" could be selected on the basis of some entirely different function\n\n If it is on the basis of a different function why would we expect the selection to be towards a flagellum as opposed to towards the different function? What about the next one?\n \n Do we need to expect or is it sufficient to say 'it's possible the directions are the same'?\n \n \nthat also happens to provide improved locomotion.\n\n How would it do that if minimal flagellar function has not been accomplished?\n \n \nThis is possible even if the improvement is far from the optimal locomotion ultimately obtained by a full flagellum. It is possible even if the organism doesn't use the change that would provide improved locomotion for locomotion at all!\n\n Yes it is possible, there are no laws about what mutations or what coincidences can happen.\n \n I only make claims about what patterns can be predicted and produced.\n \n \nIn any event, it certainly does not have to be a \"functional flagellum\" that is selected, in the sense that flagella function now.\n\n It would have to be on the functional domain if you want to start using the selection pressure for locomotion driven by that system.\n \n \n \nThe answer is that they weren't \"flagellum parts\" initially. Or at least, they didn't have to be.\n\n They were just nearly identical?\n \n \nBut this doesn't mean they couldn't have been selected on the basis of some other functionality. One functionality can set up the parts for a system that later takes on another functionality.\n\n A non-existent system that later forms and takes on a function different from the functionality that produced the parts.\n \n Is it chance or selection that these parts can form a new function?\n \n \nYou seem to be saying that this is impossible. But you'r not providing any argument at all for why such a thing can't happen. So I don't feel inclined to agree.\n\n Once again, merely it's evolution.\n \n \n \nWhy not? Just the claim that it couldn't do this seems a completely unjustified leap to me. Structures can have multiple functions.\n\n Well for one there is a cap on the end of the filament so nothing could be secreted except more filamental proteins.\n \n My statement had more to do with 'Of all the changes needed to make a secretory system provide locomotion almost none would have anything to do with increasing it's benefit as a secretory system'.\n \n Bennedict has already claimed that the change was small and I have asked him to find out how small. It will be difficult for him or you because it has already been proudly stated that there is a 40-50 protein difference between a modern flagellum and a secretory system meaning that one has to make a case for a functional flagellum missing about 40-50 proteins. When Behe published his book (and as far as I know to this day) no one has tried to remove one protein and felt like publishing the results.\n \n Sorry for the confusion, I am not sure that something couldn't move the cell and spit out proteins at the same time; I am just sure that nothing like that happened because it would be the worst of both worlds, definitely a fitness valley.\n \n \nMoreover, as far as evolution is concerned, so what? Even if the secretory system did not evolve from a flagellum directly, there's no reason why a flagellum couldn't undergo a whole series of reductions, becoming no longer a flagellum -- perhaps even a non-functional vestige -- and then continue to undergo a series of modifications that yields a secretory system. Or vice versa.\n\n That actually has been claimed to happen.\n \n Your confusion here is a perfect example of why homology alone is not the proof that it is claimed to be.\n \n The assertion I was going on against was that a secretory system evolved into a flagellum not the other way around.\n \n \nAm I saying that either of these sequences did happen? No! But I am saying that they could have happened. You are claiming that they could not have, and as far as I can see, without any justification whatsoever.\n\n I think it's time for analogy because you seem to be confused about just what I am claiming can't happen.\n \n A theory states that a bunch of cavemen are capable of producing a skyscraper. \n \n The mechanism states that the way they will accomplish this is by randomly attaching metal pieces to each other if it's taller than it used to be they copy it and try to modify it again, but there is a rule that says if it's not at least 10 stories they have to throw the design away (minimal function).\n \n I can claim that it is practically impossible for them to build a 10 story building by randomly assembling pieces of metal, and that even if they did by definition it would be 10 stories high in a single try because if it wasn't it would be thrown away.\n \n I can then claim it is impossible for them to build a 10 story building by a series of numerous slight height increasing steps.\n \n So far you have basically made the equivalent of two arguments against this claim.\n \n 1a. The building can get taller after they get a 10 story one. (not contended)\n \n 1b. A thirty story building can shorten to a ten story building (so that explains the 10 story building?)\n \n 2. A skyscraper of 10 stories can be built by a series of numerous height increasing steps, in fact those steps can be listed.\n \n 2.) is also not contended, the only thing that was contended is whether it can be carried out by the mechanism in question. Of course you can build a skyscraper of over 10 stories people do it a lot.\n \n Similarly it can't be impossible to form a secretory system or a flagellum, they are here aren't they?\n \n \n \nAs for the \"unselected steps\": not all evolution is adaptive. Some of it is selectively neutral, and one of the best known phenomena in this regard is genetic drift. But there is absolutely no reason why a feature that is, at one time, selectively neutral cannot become, at a later time, selectively relevant, either positively or negatively.\n\n Yes but there are rules to what can be selectively relevant at any given time, the rule I am using is that the structure in question must exist and have benefit towards a selection pressure.\n \n \nIf one is going to claim that such a pathway of steps has actually happened, in any particular instance, then one must of course provide evidence. But you seem to think that there's a problem with the whole idea of such a sequence involving non-selected steps. And you don't present any argument for why that's the case.\n\n I have it was probably so simple you missed it.\n \n The problem with unselected steps are that unselected steps are random steps (random mutation).\n \n \nAs for the \"steps that were selected by chance with respect to that system\": for the final system?\n\n Depends on where you are measuring from and to, I am measuring from proposed precursors to minimal function, but any 'final' as in the end result system would be hidden from natural selection for the same reason the minimal function would.\n \n \ni.e., for the outcome of all those steps? Well, okay. But there's no chance involved in the selection of the steps themselves. To the extent that they provide benefits, they'll be selected for; to the extent that they provide detriments, they'll be selected against -- at the time of their own existence. What they might do in some far-off future, generations hence, is completely irrelevant. Natural selection is at work in the present, not the future.\n\n Yes\n \n \nOn the basis of what you've written, I think IC has some major problems in dealing with change of functionality through time.\n\n It's functionality through time that it is based upon.\n \n Specifically the fact that not all function existed throughout time, it formed at some time.\n \n You have mentioned many things that can change through time, but it may take some time yet to realize that none of those changes are much different with respect to future systems than random mutation.\n \n This becomes apparent after you try to think of a selection pressure at any point which will allow for the selection of a non-existent function.\n \n You see it's a prerequisite but by itself it does not produce selection, a system is also needed to select. \n \n \n\"Organelles in eukaryotes are IC because the failure of any of the control systems for internal membranes would render the whole cell inoperable.\"\n \n how about prokaryotic cells in comparison to eukaryotic cells? they still function without the component that controlls all other functions.\n\n Prokaryotic DNA and proteins do not need to move through or be compartmentalized by a membrane to access the cytoplasm nor does it need to construct an internal membrane.

   "...which means it's transformation into it is a coincidence, a piece of luck.\n\n \n In the sense of the mutation, that is absolutely correct. Mutations are chance events: As individual occurrences, they are unpredictable. [I should add here, that this is not to say that they are unpredictable considered stochastically, anymore than the randomness of radioactive decay in a single atom renders the notion of half-life incoherent. I don't know that it's relevant here, but I thought I'd mention it, just to avoid confusion.] And it is indeed a lucky coincidence when any such chance event turns out to have beneficial consequences for the singular organism that possesses it.\n \n It is also the case that, as we have both agreed, such random mutation is not sufficient for adaptive evolution. I don't see any problem with this so far. The problem is, natural selection as it is understood by the very evolutionary biologists you seek to criticize does not leave things random. It is a filtering mechanism, that works entirely non-randomly. Let's continue:\n \n \nThat breaks the chain of process, it is not merely one random element being filtered like is the case with random mutation but in fact the entire evolution of the previous system being dragged into a post hoc position of being a pre-cursor but without any selective justification as there always is in true evolution.\n\n \n I'm really not sure I understand what's going on here. \"The chain of process?\" \"True evolution?\"\n \n Stop me if I'm wrong, but are you claiming that there must be \"selective justification\" for mutations themselves? That's as close as I've been able to come to making sense of this.\n \n \nPerhaps you could give a modification to a secretory system that is selected due to similarity with a flagellum before the flagellum existed?\n\n \n In addition to having unnecessary problems with the random nature of mutation, I think you are very hung up on definitions.\n \n Can something similar to a flagellum exist before a flagellum itself exists? I don't see why not. \"Flagellum\" is just a word that we use to describe a structure, and what matters for evolution is the structure itself, not what we call it.\n \n Meanwhile, my whole point was that until it reaches the stage that we would call \"flagellum,\" the system could be selected due to something that has nothing to do with resemblance to a flagellum -- but it could nonetheless possess similarities to such a thing. And at some point, those similarities may enable the system to function as a flagellum.\n \n I have no problem whatsoever with saying that said point would be a matter of chance, in the ordinary sense of random mutation. Because mutations do happen, and they are random in the sense of being unpredictable, and they sometimes produce benefits. If such random but beneficial mutations do happen, they get non-randomly selected for -- and this is the engine of evolution, not just the random mutation itself.\n \n \nHow would it do that if minimal flagellar function has not been accomplished?\n\n \n Such minimal functionality could be provided by random mutation. Crude, refined -- minimal. I have no problem whatsoever with chalking up such a minimal functionality in singular instances to, \"Well, how about that.\"\n \n But this is part, and only part, of the story where adaptive evolution is concerned. Natural selection is the other part. And it can take minimal functionality and shape it into something more complex and refined.\n \n You seem to want natural selection to be the whole story. It isn't. There is a random part (mutation) and a non-random part (natural selection).\n \n \nYes it is possible, there are no laws about what mutations or what coincidences can happen.\n\n \n Which seems to give up the whole game!!!\n \n The question that we then have to ask is, well, what mutations happened and when? What is the evidence for mutation x? This -- to repeat -- is something I see evolutionists as doing. (And please note, there can be evidence that a given event did happen even if events of that type occur randomly.)\n \n What we further have to ask is, well, why would such a mutation be maintained and spread at that time? What evidence is there for this selective advantage y? This again is something I see them as doing.\n \n \nIs it chance or selection that these parts can form a new function?\n\n \n In the case of the individual that initially undergoes the mutation? Chance.\n \n In the case of the descendants for whom it later becomes a normal state of affairs? Selection.\n \n Taken together, and only taken together, we have evolution. Evolution involves mutation and natural selection. A random element and a non-random element.\n \n \nI think it's time for analogy because you seem to be confused about just what I am claiming can't happen.\n \n A theory states that a bunch of cavemen are capable of producing a skyscraper. \n \n The mechanism states that the way they will accomplish this is by randomly attaching metal pieces to each other if it's taller than it used to be they copy it and try to modify it again, but there is a rule that says if it's not at least 10 stories they have to throw the design away (minimal function).\n \n I can claim that it is practically impossible for them to build a 10 story building by randomly assembling pieces of metal, and that even if they did by definition it would be 10 stories high in a single try because if it wasn't it would be thrown away.\n \n I can then claim it is impossible for them to build a 10 story building by a series of numerous slight height increasing steps.\n\n \n And I think this analogy is poor, because your \"rule\" of \"minimal function\" has no parallel in biological reality. For there may be any number of reasons why biological counterparts of buildings smaller than 10 floors, and even much less expansive than a single floor, could be useful -- any number of functions that could be fulfilled. If, at each step along the way, there is a selective advantage for our cavemen contsruction workers, why would they have to scrap the whole thing? Answer: they wouldn't.\n \n \nSo far you have basically made the equivalent of two arguments against this claim.\n \n 1a. The building can get taller after they get a 10 story one. (not contended)\n \n 1b. A thirty story building can shorten to a ten story building (so that explains the 10 story building?)\n \n 2. A skyscraper of 10 stories can be built by a series of numerous height increasing steps, in fact those steps can be listed.\n\n \n I have claimed none of these things. I have directly challenged your requirement of \"minimal function,\" where the only function that seems to matter is an arbitrarily chosen function at the latest stage of the process.\n \n And I would challenge it with regard to the flagellum as well. So what, if a structure -- regardless of its name, which I'm not going to get hung up on -- could not function as a \"flagellum\" until what it does is something we recognize as \"flagellar\" in nature? This does not mean that it can't have other functions prior to achieving that state we call \"flagellum\" and be selected in terms of those other functions!\n \n \n...there are rules to what can be selectively relevant at any given time, the rule I am using is that the structure in question must exist and have benefit towards a selection pressure.\n\n \n But not necessarily towards the selection pressure that the latest strucure has. Earlier versions of the structure could have benefits under selection pressures that no longer obtain.\n \n You keep saying that the standard argument against IC doesn't work. But you keep setting up situations in which it's wholly appropriate to make that argument.\n \n \nThe problem with unselected steps are that unselected steps are random steps (random mutation).\n\n \n But why is the unselected step of random mutation a problem? No one is saying that random mutation is sufficient to explain adaptive evolution. But neither is non-random natural selection; it certainly doesn't explain mutations themselves.\n \n I am beginning to think you have a problem with allowing \"chance\" any role in evolution. I myself would have a big problem with reducing evolution to chance. But \"random mutation PLUS non-random natural selection\" does not do so.",

The structure does not have to change to take on a new function. It just has to be used differently.\n \n My walking hands can be used for digging. They can be used for that already, even if they are not specifically selected for it. So if conditions change, and selection pressure for digging develops, I don't need a whole new kind of irreducibly complex structure. All I need is for the existing structure to get better at something it currently does poorly.\n \n Heck, for that matter this even applies to flight. I can use my arms to try to fly. They are very poor for this, and I'm dead if I try it in any significant way. But what if I had feathers on my arms, feathers that had evolved for some purpose other than flight? I still might fail -- but perhaps not as badly. And depending on the selective pressures, succeeding generations might get better at it.\n \n Like I said, you don't always seem to ignore this. You yourself noted that feet can be used to swim. But you don't seem to take it to heart very often.\n \n \nAre you prepared to claim that a limb can perform any tast?\n\n \n Not successfully, as in my flight example!\n \n But of course there are generalized limbs, and there are specialized limbs. And its easier to evolve something from a generalized limb, since its range of functions is less lopsided in one functional direction.\n \n But even a specialized limb isn't totally useless for other functions.

Whether a structure yet conforms to our definition of \"flagellum\" is entirely irrelevant to whether it can be used as the type of structure we would call a \"flagellum.\"\n \n Like I said, in addition to unnecessary problems with \"randomness,\" you seem unnecessarily hung up on definitions.

And it can take minimal functionality and shape it into something more complex and refined.\n\n Of course, but now I can see you are seeing the assumption taking form.\n \n The assumption that minimal function need not be evolved but is equivalent to the kind of small mutations we normally see?\n \n \nYou seem to want natural selection to be the whole story. It isn't. There is a random part (mutation) and a non-random part (natural selection).\n\n Natural selection is the whole story when it comes to filtering that random input and outputting patterned genetic change.\n \n I have asked others many times if there is another mechanism that does this for life and none has been presented.\n \n \nWhich seems to give up the whole game!!!\n\n No more than admitting a Boeing 747 could assemble from random particle vectors in deep space gives up the whole game of 'do 747 evolve?'.\n \n \nThe question that we then have to ask is, well, what mutations happened and when? What is the evidence for mutation x? This -- to repeat -- is something I see evolutionists as doing. (And please note, there can be evidence that a given event did happen even if events of that type occur randomly.)\n\n The question we have to ask after we establish and agree that random genetic change unfiltered by natural selection is not evolution.\n \n \nWhat we further have to ask is, well, why would such a mutation be maintained and spread at that time? What evidence is there for this selective advantage y? This again is something I see them as doing.\n\n I am not concerned with the end point in the cases of evolving novel function; the reason being that by the time it is selected and spread to the rest of the population it already exists, and it's formation via evolution is what I am questioning.\n \n \nIn the case of the descendants for whom it later becomes a normal state of affairs? Selection.\n\n No, there can be no selection without function, I am asking about the parts.\n \n \nAnd I think this analogy is poor, because your \"rule\" of \"minimal function\" has no parallel in biological reality.\n\n and that is where the definition of IC comes in.\n \n It is far to tautologous to be misunderstood.\n \n A set of necessary components implies minimal function.\n \n The best you can hope for is to set the bar low.\n \n \nFor there may be any number of reasons why biological counterparts of buildings smaller than 10 floors, and even much less expansive than a single floor, could be useful -- any number of functions that could be fulfilled. If, at each step along the way, there is a selective advantage for our cavemen contsruction workers, why would they have to scrap the whole thing? Answer: they wouldn't.\n\n Then the selection would be different, the goal would no longer be a sky scraper, perhaps it is now a warehouse.\n \n Then we are back to co-option, is it chance or selection that a warehouse becomes a skyscraper?\n \n \nI have claimed none of these things.\n\n 1a is all the times you have pointed out that a function could become more complex and refined after it existed.\n \n 1b is all the times you pointed out that multiple functions could reduce to one.\n \n 2 is the times when you indicated that the stories about evolutionary pathways explain the evolution of say a flagellum.\n \n \nI have directly challenged your requirement of \"minimal function,\" where the only function that seems to matter is an arbitrarily chosen function at the latest stage of the process.\n\n That challenge is biologically unmaintainable.\n \n You would have to be operating in a different field of reality to say that there is no minimal structure requirements to fulfill functions.\n \n In fact an implication of that statement is that every structure is capable of fulfilling every function to some degree.\n \n There are minimal functions, and in the case of the flagellum it appears to be equivalent to the modern system. (still waiting for those removable parts).\n \n \nAnd I would challenge it with regard to the flagellum as well. So what, if a structure -- regardless of its name, which I'm not going to get hung up on -- could not function as a \"flagellum\" until what it does is something we recognize as \"flagellar\" in nature? This does not mean that it can't have other functions prior to achieving that state we call \"flagellum\" and be selected in terms of those other functions!\n\n Correct\n \n \nBut not necessarily towards the selection pressure that the latest strucure has.\n\n In which case there is absolutely no reason why selection would move the DNA towards the latest structure.\n \n \nEarlier versions of the structure could have benefits under selection pressures that no longer obtain.\n\n Perhaps I need to hear that co-option isn't impossible just one more time? Pretty please?\n \n \nYou keep saying that the standard argument against IC doesn't work. But you keep setting up situations in which it's wholly appropriate to make that argument.\n\n There are no situations where it is appropriate to make that argument because it is incorrect in it's foundations.\n \n It does not proceed from first principles, as far as I am concerned it is merely a more plausibility friendly way of asserting spontaneous generation.\n \n \nBut why is the unselected step of random mutation a problem? No one is saying that random mutation is sufficient to explain adaptive evolution. But neither is non-random natural selection; it certainly doesn't explain mutations themselves.\n\n Unselected steps are a problem because if you try to setup a pathway made of them you will be claiming exactly what you just denied.\n \n \nI am beginning to think you have a problem with allowing \"chance\" any role in evolution.\n\n Chance's role is to be selected, many variations one is chosen and survives.\n \n Chance's role is to provide the options between which natural selection chooses the greatest benefit.\n \n Chance's role is not to explain the evolution of systems whilst having no selection before they exist.\n \n No mutation is selected before it exists and no mutation is evolved.\n \n No novel system is selected before it exists and no novel system is evolved.\n \n My problem is with equating chance with evolution, while at the same time specifying the mechanism as random mutation + natural selection.\n \n \nI myself would have a big problem with reducing evolution to chance.\n\n I do as well.\n \n \nBut \"random mutation PLUS non-random natural selection\" does not do so.\n\n That is why my argument specifies the circumstances in which the change is \n Random mutation WITHOUT non-random natural selection as the problems to evolve.\n \n \nWhat is there to prove?\n\n \n \n \nok, so evolution CAN select mutations that lead to the existence of new structures. Your words\n\n The existance of a conditional do not equal admission.\n \n That said evolution can technically select mutations that lead to the existance of new structures by chance if an existing structure being refined is moving towards a non-existent structure.\n \n That however is useless when it comes to claiming something evolved because the chance part negated the filtering of natural selection.\n \n i.e. yes it was filtered but the filter was not for the benefit it's trying to be linked to.\n \n \nok, maintained (existing) systems must be selected for. Again, your words.\n\n I am pretty sure I said selection pressure which would have more to do with the removal of degrading mutations.\n \n \nYou're saying that mutations (evolution) can produce new structures.\n\n Ah, here is the gooey center. 'mutations (evolution)', so they are synonyms?\n \n This is exactly the error I am claiming you are all making, which mathew just finished agreeing with me on.\n \n \nAre you saying that swimming and flying are within the same functional domain, but liquid expulsion and hydraulic propulsion are not within the same functional domain?\n\n You are thinking on a macroscopic scale, that secretory system does not eject 'liquids' per say but proteins.\n \n It could not possibly provide serious locomotion that way nor could any real life cell afford the cost of expending amino acids like that.\n \n \nI'd love to know how you determine which functions fall into your \"functional domain\" groupings.\n\n If a modification of scale or shape will suffice between two structures they are on the same functional domain.\n \n Another definition would be there would be no minimal function gaps between the various applications.\n \n That being said I am not sure that there is a direct gradient between walking or swimming and powered flight; because there is a minimal function problem there, of course there is probably a work around to pass through another gradient like gliding.\n \n They are on the same functional domain because a wing is a special shape of limb.\n \n \nI'm prepared to show (again) that almost any structure in an organism can perform multiple tasks.\n\n You listed off what I was calling at that time applications and beneficial side effects.\n \n \nMy arms are limbs. I cannot fly with them.\n\n Meaning it would be very hard to select for good aerodynamics until you start.\n \n \nOutside of functional domain, according to your \"definition\". A flagellum system can propel an organism. It can also expel secretions. Within functional domain, according to your \"definition\". If I missed anything, let me know.\n\n You missed a basis for your statements.\n \n \nYour claims that an existing system cannot evolve into a non-existent system is contradicted right here.\n\n How?\n \n \nMake up your mind. Is it impossible for a new system to randomly appear from existing dna? Or is it not impossible?\n\n I have always said it was possible.",

   "But for large numbers of random events? Plenty. Just as with any other modern science, it can be dealt with mathematically -- in this case, via statistics.\n\n Alright try to apply it in this case.\n \n What can you predict will be the resulting code from random mutation without selection?\n \n \nAnd... this is exactly what you seem -- frequently -- to deny, whenever you say things like you do during the following exchange:\n\n If a structure is capable of a function (even if it is one of many) then how can it change to then be capable of that function?\n \n I do not mean change as in optimize or specialize, I mean change as in it stopped doing the function it was doing and switched to a function it did not have.\n \n \nBut it doesn't. The structure does not have to change to take on a new function. It just has to be used differently.\n\n Then it already has that function, again we switched terminologies midway.\n \n \nMy walking hands can be used for digging. They can be used for that already, even if they are not specifically selected for it. So if conditions change, and selection pressure for digging develops, I don't need a whole new kind of irreducibly complex structure. All I need is for the existing structure to get better at something it currently does poorly.\n\n I know, that is not what I was talking about when I said change in function.\n \n \n \nHeck, for that matter this even applies to flight. I can use my arms to try to fly. They are very poor for this, and I'm dead if I try it in any significant way. But what if I had feathers on my arms, feathers that had evolved for some purpose other than flight? I still might fail -- but perhaps not as badly. And depending on the selective pressures, succeeding generations might get better at it.\n\n That is one slight selection pressure to latch on to, might hit the ground 0.001% lighter than previous generation.\n \n \nLike I said, you don't always seem to ignore this. You yourself noted that feet can be used to swim. But you don't seem to take it to heart very often.\n\n I don't ignore it at all, I know that structures can have different functions.\n \n In the old terminology I would say different applications but now it is different functions and what can't change is a functional domain.\n \n \n \nBut it can be selected for some other reason, while incidentally having a resemblance to the flagellum. Such a structure can exist, and it doesn't matter in the slightest that \"the flagellum\" doesn't exist.\n \n We're not talking Platonic forms here. We're talking actually existent structures and how they actually get used. Whether a structure yet conforms to our definition of \"flagellum\" is entirely irrelevant to whether it can be used as the type of structure we would call a \"flagellum.\"\n\n We have been over this already, I think you must already know what I agree with and what I don't.\n \n Since it is apparent that I am not making the connection you are with the agreed upon premises you may need to specify the logic explicitly.\n \n \nBut this ignores half the story. Selection does indeed push things in that direction. But the modifications themselves do not. They are as unguided as ever. They're not produced by selection -- they happen, and are selected.\n\n Yes, and it would be incorrect to say that the variation is produced by selection and therefore evolved.\n \n It is only the entire change taken as series of selections that evolved.\n \n \nMutations really are random, like it or not. They really are not predictable in their individual instances. Despite your rhetoric, this does not mean that, in those individual instances, they occur simply because they can, and no biologist has ever claimed so. But biologists do claim that statistics can be used to study mutational likelihoods and rates and such. (If you have a problem with that, then please direct your ire at physicists' \"half-life\" next.)\n\n and that is part II, where I was at with peeling.\n \n You seem so interested in it all you have to do is cede the very simple and self-evident points on evolution and selection.\n \nMeanwhile, the role that chance does play in variation (not just mutation, but recombination involves randomness, albeit less in the latter case thanks to how it happens) is mitigated by the process of natural selection. This is why the end result of evolution isn't just chaos, but varying degrees of adaptedness.\n \n I can't help but wonder if maybe you and \"Jakers\" are actually the same person. He certainly shared your philosophical antipathy to randomness. As I read more of your posts, that increasingly appears to be the root of the problem here.\n\n I have no idea who jakers is, I have no philisophical antipathy to randomness or the fact that it exists or the fact that systems which are apparently random at their basic levels are predictable as a whole.",

The number of differences in any number of things is so great that for all of them to have changed at once -- it just beggars the statistical imagination.\n \n In any event, when you say \"and that was selected,\" doesn't that automatically turn this into an evolutionary scenario, rather than mere mutation?\n \n Like I said, I just don't get where you're coming from.\n \n \nThere are no evolutionary pathways to single mutations or their longer lasting equivalents modification via co-option and genetic drift.\n\n \n And it's this last part in particular, about co-option, that I still can't understand. It's just not clear to me what the big problem with co-option is.\n \n \nUnlike say improvement however there is no reason to expect selection to move in a direction that ends in co-option.\n\n \n Why not? I mean, look. I think evolution is unpredictable, in particular cases. Just because some species has a structure that could get co-opted for some purpose, that doesn't mean it will.\n \n \nIf the way you are thinking of evolution was valid, even improvements would remain unexplained as well as novelty.\n\n \n Not so. Some mutations/variations are beneficial. Those get selected. It's no big mystery.\n \n \nYet in every example of true evolution it is easy to see that there is a target, I cite the fossil record for the gradual change in a unified direction.\n\n \n This just seems to be retroactively reading a teleology into events that, at the time, weren't predictable. Calling one point the \"target\" just because it's where things ended up isn't justified simply by the fact that's where things ended up.\n \n Maybe the best way I can describe what appears to be the difference between you and me is to consider the difference between an unguided missile and a guided missile.\n \n The unguided missile doesn't reach its final destination on the basis of being directed there out front. It's fired, and where it goes next is definitely related to what came behid -- it can certainly be explained in such terms. And as it veers from its initial course, that too can be explained, and its still related to where it just was. And so forth. It gets somewhere, and its whole path is explainable -- but where it gets isn't the result of guidance.\n \n The guided missile has a target. Like the unguided missile, the guided missile is related to causes behind it -- but it also has a target out front, that it's striving to reach. When it veers off course, it compensates. It doesn't just get somewhere, it gets where it was always supposed to go.\n \n My claim is, evolution is an unguided missile. Is it safe to say, you think its a guided missile?\n \n \nThen the selection would be different, the goal would no longer be a sky scraper, perhaps it is now a warehouse.\n\n \n Again with the \"goal\" issue!

It's empirical science, not a priori metaphysics.\n \n \nNo mutation is selected before it exists and no mutation is evolved.\n\n \n Agreed.\n \n \nNo novel system is selected before it exists and no novel system is evolved.\n\n \n And this seems unjustified. If mutation were the only way of producing a novel system, I'd agree. Why is natural selection, acting upon already existing mutations (or otherwise given variations), incapable of producing novel systems? That's one of the things I don't get.\n \n \nMy problem is with equating chance with evolution, while at the same time specifying the mechanism as random mutation + natural selection.\n\n \n And I don't see myself or anyone else doing that.",

It's fired, and where it goes next is definitely related to what came behid -- it can certainly be explained in such terms. And as it veers from its initial course, that too can be explained, and its still related to where it just was. And so forth. It gets somewhere, and its whole path is explainable -- but where it gets isn't the result of guidance.\n\n Yet evolution predicts it gets to a certain place, if this missile is the changes in a sequence and you are claiming we don't know where it will end up, then how do we know it will end up as a functional system, one that is more functional than where it was fired from no less?\n \n Now apparently it is a very common fallacy among creationist to envision some kind of perfect endgame system in every case (probably because they are constantly told life is perfect), and so I get a lot of flak from evolutionist thinking they have identified that in me.\n \n I am not talking about any specific goal but the general goal of more functional systems.\n \n A goal which is inescapable if you care to consider more than one mutation.\n \n \nThe guided missile has a target. Like the unguided missile, the guided missile is related to causes behind it -- but it also has a target out front, that it's striving to reach. When it veers off course, it compensates. It doesn't just get somewhere, it gets where it was always supposed to go.\n\n and when the missile of our genetic sequence veers off course, natural selection compensates. It doesn't just end up somewhere, it is always are more or equally beneficial sequence in the end.\n \n Now if the missile was repeatedly launched and there was a curve or a line of beneficial sequences leading away from it, the total goal is in that direction.\n \n \nMy claim is, evolution is an unguided missile. Is it safe to say, you think its a guided missile?\n\n Yes, it is a 'dumb' guided missile. Like a sidewinder it does not know it is supposed to destroy another plane, but it does have a definite criteria and standard for course correction, heat. (benefit)\n \n \nDidn't say there weren't. Just tried to indicate that no particular function is set as some goal toward which selection is supposed to move the structure. It's the arbitrariness of the function I was objecting to, not the idea that there are minimal structural requirements to perform functions.\n\n Minimal structural requirements to perform a function is what I mean when I say minimal function.\n \n \nThis isn't an argument from first principles. It's empirical science, not a priori metaphysics.\n\n Empirically you could say that something happened, in this case that life exists, but to say that there is an explanation, a cause one must provide a reason.\n \n Using the term first principles in this context is probably suspect and I apologize. What I meant by it are the empirical facts of that science. You cannot derive the structure of DNA without a posteriori (meaning researched in this case) knowledge.\n \n When I say that co-option's validity as a substitute for selection can't be deduced from 'first principles' I mean that no fact about biology supports the idea that their instances aren't random or are in any way influenced by the benefit of the systems involved.\n \n \n \nAnd this seems unjustified. If mutation were the only way of producing a novel system, I'd agree. Why is natural selection, acting upon already existing mutations (or otherwise given variations), incapable of producing novel systems? That's one of the things I don't get.\n\n *Stands up with mouth gaping in disbelief.\n \n That is exactly what I am trying to tell you, the answer to that precise question and for three pages now the rebuttal has been basically 'but it's not impossible'.\n \n In any case I am very glad are at least asking the correct question, I was worried we were arguing for no reason, databed at the end of our debate tried to cop out and say 'that's all your saying of course no one thinks that' and wanted to start talking about the odds of mutations producing novel system regardless of any selection.\n \n For now, let me tie this into that analogy you just made, why is it incapable?\n \n Well if a novel system is somewhere on an open terrain what makes you think that an unguided missile will strike it?\n \n Why is a novel system or a long improvement a target of natural selection?\n \n \nAnd I don't see myself or anyone else doing that.\n\n Is it evolution producing a system if a system is produced via co-option?\n \n \nNothing. That's the point of random.\n \n This is one of those moments that makes me think we're talking past each other.\n\n Perhaps in this case we are, it seems to me that I prove the formation of IC structures is random, yet you still seem to claim that evolution predicts i.e. explains their existance.\n \n \nBut why can't it do both?\n\n Well because it couldn't do the second it couldn't evolve the second.\n \n \nPlease understand: I know you've said before that you recognize that systems can perform multiple functions. But do you see how what is quoted immediately above gives the impression of not accounting for that?\n\n No I don't.\n \n I account for systems performing multiple functions and that in no way necessitates a change in functional domains.\n \n \nBut this doesn't seem to be true. Evolution can involve maintenance, too. Each instance of the selections is an example of evolution. A good example is Weiner's The Beak of the Finch, chronicling the Grants' work.\n\n In that case the 'persistence of the system' evolved but it sounds a bit odd.\n \n \nOr do you think of evolution solely in terms of novelty?\n\n Well I wouldn't say that.\n \n It is certainly the mechanism of evolution that maintains systems as well as improves them, and it is somewhat the same thing as selecting itself is merely making permanent and prevalent a variation.\n \n but the word as a verb does imply change.\n \n \nThere is no 'IF' in that.. there is no single mutation that turned a chimp into a human. There might be a series of mutations that turn that common ancestor of the human/chimp into a human, and there are a different series of mutations that turned the common ancestor of the human/chimp into a chimp. \n \n The mutations might be 'random'.. but the selection process is not. However, the selection process does not have a 'GOAL'.... The traits that promote reproductive fitness get 'selected' for... the traits that reduce reproductive fitness get selected against.. but the the variations in traits in a population of individuals is random.\n\n A mutation like that is practically impossible, aye.\n \n Mutations are random Yep.\n \n Selection is not, Yes.\n \n We seem to agree on everything except the 'goal' evolution does have a goal or it could not move towards it. If it did not move towards it it would have no direction, if it had no direction there would be no possibility of moving consistently from less functional sequences to more functional sequences, and that has just contradicted the premise of beneficial selection.\n \n It is self contradictory to claim there is no general target in a series of directed changes.",

   "[Okay, a lot is becoming clearer now. Let me focus things a bit more tightly.\n \n \nIt explains the prevalence of the system but not it's production.\n \n To be selected and spread to the rest of the population it needs to exist.\n\n \n But evolution doesn't purport to be the science that explains why individual variations -- whether mutations or simply results of recombination, both of which are random in the same sense -- do or don't happen.\n \n \nI sometimes think that no evolutionist has ever thought the theory was more than that, but that must be absurd because that alone would not explain even the most basic improvements.\n\n \n It won't explain the singular occurrence of beneficial mutations. But it doesn't claim to. It seems you want evolution to explain something it cannot, and that it doesn't say it can.\n \n \nIt must be realized that the accumulation of beneficial changes is everything when it comes to actually explaining structures.\n\n \n And evolution explains exactly how structures that are adaptive accumulate in populations. It does not explain how they first happen in individual organisms. And never claimed to.\n \n \nThis idea of consistent directional genetic change absolutely inherent in the concept of a foot evolving into a fluke.\n \n You can say 'there is a benefit sometimes and it is selected' till you turn blue in the face but the man on the island isn't going to think that limbs evolved from flukes till you tell him about that concept.\n \n That concept is guided mutation.\n\n \n But what I don't get is how guided mutation is different from natural selection. Let me explain.\n \n 1. It's one thing to say that mutations (or other variations) are random, and they are channeled -- \"guided,\" if you will -- by natural selection in this direction or that. Under this scenario, the mutations/variations themselves have no particular direction. But only those that are selected for over the process of natural selection will accumulate, and that process leads the mutations/variations to accumulate in a particular direction rather.\n \n 2. It's another thing to say that mutations (or other variations) are already channelled in a particular direction, even without natural selection. Under this scenario, the mutations/variations arise when they are needed. Natural selection helps them spread. But their existence itself was already brought about by a prior directionality of some kind.\n \n I cannot tell for certain, but you seem to accept 2. I cannot, though I can accept 1. This is because all of the available evidence indicates that beneficial mutations do not occur at any greater rate than random occurrence would dictate.\n \n Consider a scenario addressed in The Beak of the Finch. Larger beaks are more advantageous for surviving drought, and they are heritable. Smaller beaks are more advantageous for surviving under wetter conditions. (For details of why, see the book.) A pair of things are interesting to note: A) After a drought has ended, when the survivors have offspring during a returned wet season, they produce larger-beaked offspring in proportion to the survivors' genetics, not in proportion to what will now be advantageous. B) But despite this, over time, as wet conditions persist, smaller beaks will tend to increase in numbers, as a result of selection. So there is a directionality imparted by selection, not inherent in the variations themselves. Selection determines which of the variations will do better at surviving and reproducing.\n \n Like I said, maybe you don't disagree. But then what exactly is \"guided mutation?\" The above is just \"unguided mutation, plus natural selection.\"\n \n \nYet evolution predicts it gets to a certain place, if this missile is the changes in a sequence and you are claiming we don't know where it will end up, then how do we know it will end up as a functional system, one that is more functional than where it was fired from no less?\n\n \n But we don't know it will end up as a functional system!\n \n Evolution doesn't predict where evolution will go. It tries to reconstruct what happened in the past, including not only the cases of successful adaptation, but also the cases of failure, such as extinction.\n \n \nand when the missile of our genetic sequence veers off course, natural selection compensates. It doesn't just end up somewhere, it is always are more or equally beneficial sequence in the end.\n\n \n Not so! Extinction is also an evolutionary event.\n \n \nWe seem to agree on everything except the 'goal' evolution does have a goal or it could not move towards it. If it did not move towards it it would have no direction, if it had no direction there would be no possibility of moving consistently from less functional sequences to more functional sequences, and that has just contradicted the premise of beneficial selection.\n\n \n But let's be clear: Such movement is not necessarily \"consistent.\" Certainly that can happen, but temporary regressions or even irremediable veering off course are clearly possible. Indeed, temporary regressions are often responsible for \"maintenance,\" which resolved to generation-after-generation is revealed to involve \"oscillation\" (see the Weiner book yet again). And extinction is often the result of a serious deviation.\n \n Is this starting to clarify the differences in where we're coming from? or at least, where I understand you better and worse?",

   "Let's start with the last thing first:\n \n \nyou are capable of understanding what I am saying, but it seems you still do not understand my position because I am still seeing many.... what would be strawmen if they were intentional.\n\n \n Well, right, they're not intentional: they're just misunderstandings. I think the reason for the misunderstandings is clear to me now, though, as I'll explain below.\n \n \nThen evolution does not explain the advancement of life, because the advancement of life necessitates a great many novel systems.\n\n \n This seems to me to be a point of semantics. If by explaining \"the advancement of life,\" one means why individual cases of variation end up being beneficial -- why an individual organism's \"life is advanced,\" so to speak, by its variations -- then you're right: evolution doesn't explain that.\n \n But it doesn't claim to explain such a thing.\n \n If by explaining \"the advancement of life,\" one means why whole species end up being better adapted to their environments over time, then evolution does explain that, through natural selection. The beneficial variations are selected for and hence accumulate.\n \n If by explaining \"the advancment of life,\" one means something more normatively neutral, like a trajectory through time, then evolution can explain even more.\n \n Again using natural selection, evolution explains how species go extinct. When environmental conditions change (a shift in climate, introduction of a predator, etc), and beneficial variations don't happen, the organisms may well be selected against to the point where they get wiped out.\n \n Moreover, through genetic drift, evolution explains how whole species come to possess non-adaptive features. In small populations (resulting especially bottleneck or founding events), statistically random features that aren't selected against but also aren't selected for can nonetheless become the norm for later generations, because the range of variations is lessened.\n \n So evolution can explain how species become adapted or go extinct (NS), and in at least some cases, how species take on selectively neutral features (GD). I'd say that's a quite a lot of temporal advance! And in terms of adaptations, even some normative advance, too.\n \n Now, I had asked about what differentiates guided mutations different from natural selection. And you replied:\n \n \nIt isn't. It is natural selection's effect on genetic change quantified.\n\n \n And as you say later, you would prefer to alter the name to \"guided genetic change.\" That is fine with me.\n \n I think this has been the source of a huuuuge amount of misunderstanding for me. I can see that we now basically agree.\n \n But I'm still a bit vexed. For this doesn't seem to me anything but a name game! As you say, \"it isn't\" different from natural selection! It's just the effect of natural selection on genetic changes.\n \n As we both agree, there isn't anything that intrinsically guides the individual genetic changes themselves: they're random. So natural selection \"guides\" genetic change from without. Or channels it. Or directs it. Whatever. Why do we need to call this \"guided genetic change?\" It already has a name! Viz: \"natural selection.\" Or at least, \"the outcome of natural selection.\"\n \n Like I said, it seems like a name game. And unfortunately, that leads me to believe there's still something I'm missing about your position -- hence the continuing vexation. And my worry, based in part on what follows, is that what I may be missing is a point of metaphysics.\n \n \nyou basically stated what I call rational evolution with 1.) and what I call irrational evolution with 2.)\n\n \n In one sense, this seems a semantic rather than a substantive point. I don't see the reason (if I may be forgiven the pun) for calling it \"rational evolution.\" This is simply \"evolution.\" Where does \"rationality\" come into play?\n \n Please understand: I recognize you are no creationist, in any \"Christian fundamentalist\" sense. But this still seems at minimum like language that is unnecessarily loaded with metaphysical connotations -- like Hegel, say, or Whitehead.\n \n So again, perhaps I'm misunderstanding where you're coming from.\n \n -----\n \n So let me sum up. We seem to agree on how the process works. I just don't see why we should call it \"guided genetic change\" or \"rational evolution.\" We've already got \"genetic change, subject to natural selection\" and \"evolution.\"\n \n That's the source of my misunderstanding. I don't see what \"guided\" or \"rational\" are adding to the picture. They strike me as semantics or metaphysics.\n \n Whew! At least I think we're finally clear on where the disagreement is. Or at least I think I am -- I guess we'll see whether this is it or not!",

First, there's a world of difference between predicting and producing. Evolution cannot predict when beneficial mutations will occur in individuals. But second, evolution most certainly can explain how beneficial mutations spread through a population.\n \n So I see no problem with saying that evolution produces novel systems, in populations.

[EDIT: I have never maintained this, where adaptive features are concerned. But I would maintain that non-adaptive features can evolve through various genetic drift phenomena, like bottleneck or founder effects. Such features are not selected for, but they're also not selected against. But I certainly do not maintain that adaptive features can evolve without selection.]\n \n When an individual gains a beneficial mutation, this is not \"evolution.\" Individuals don't evolve. Sometimes, you seem to use it that way in describing what evolutionists say. But nobody is doint that. Nothing adaptive evolves without selection. But variation -- which is broader than mutation, and includes it -- does happen without selection. That is all I maintain here.\n \n \nYou easily admit mutations don't evolve because there is no way for selection to influence their creation, yet you have had nothing to say about IC systems (the argument if you haven't noticed is that there is no way for selection to influence their creation) except they might be arrived at by luck (co-option, direct lucky mutation, series of unselected mutations).\n\n \n Direct lucky mutation is a non-starter for complex adaptive features. About this, we agree.\n \n But I don't know how much clearer I could make what I've said about how the systems that you are describing as \"irreducibly complex\" could be arrived at via selection working on variations. You yourself have admitted that systems could have multiple functions. Selection for one of those functions could drive the whole system in one direction. But as conditions change, what has thus far evolved could be pushed in a different direction.\n \n I do call this \"co-option,\" but I do not call it \"luck.\" And I certainly do not call it a \"series of unselected mutations,\" insofar as the variations in question do not have to be mutations in the first place, and more importantly, insofar as these variations certainly haven't gone unselected. They may have been initially unselected for their final functions (\"final\" for now, anyway). \"Co-option\" is just the occurrence of such a shift. But these steps are not \"unselected,\" they just need not be selected at one time for the same functions they are selected for at another.\n \n \nYet when I read your posts and compare systems to mutations you maintain that systems can be evolved.\n\n \n Yes, I do. In populations, via random variation and -- and -- natural selection.\n \n \nWalk me through the logic that goes from a change in allele frequencies to saying a fluke can evolve please.\n\n \n An organism's features are ultimately the product of the organism's genes directing a whole series of developmental processes. So as those genes change, the features will change. If a feature is adaptively advantageous, then the genes that are responsible for that feature will spread through the population over time. This is how features evolve.\n \n I don't see the big mystery with respect to the fluke, or to anything else. A slight advantage from this or that variation is enough to ge the ball rolling. So long as there's some degree of advantage to the genetic and morphological variation, it will spread. Further similar variations will do the same, so long as the selective conditions remain the same.\n \n And I would hope that I do not have to say again, that this is not a matter of discussing how any individual comes to have the particular more-or-less fluke-like tail that it does. That's what molecular genetics and developmental biology are for. Evolution is about populations, and not individuals. It can explain an individual's features only to the extent they're considered as members of a population, in general terms, rather than as the particular individuals that they are.\n \n \nWell it seemed as if you were evading IC's implications by dumping the idea that evolution could cause any kind of coherent pattern at all.\n\n \n Where have I ever said that evolution causes no patterns? Randomness is not a pattern. But natural selection is precisely what pulls patterns -- adaptive patterns -- from the randomness of variation.",

That question is equivalent to can a series of beneficial mutations lead in a coherent direction towards the wheels?\n \n \nI agree to this, so long as, and only so long as, we are talking about mutations in individuals.

   "and?\n\n \n And... you were the one who drove the wedge between shifting gene frequencies and anatomical structures. I was merely trying to reconnect them.\n \n \nIt must predict anything that is claimed to be explained.\n\n \n And to repeat the point, what evolution can predict is how genes will spread through a population. It doesn't not make predictions about what's going to happen to any individual organism at any given time.\n \n It seems to me, that you are asking evolution to explain something it has never even claimed to explain, and then criticizing it as \"irrational\" for being unable to explain it.\n \n \nA scientific theory is by nature a proposed cause-effect relationship where the cause is the explanation of the effect; this also necessitates that where the cause exists an effect is predicted.\n\n \n And when random variations occur, and these are selected, this combination of variation plus selection causes the population in question to evolve. There is no problem here.\n \n \nIf it explains novel systems, it must predict they exist by the stated cause, the stated cause in this case is the mechanism of evolution natural selection + random mutation.\n\n \n But as I keep saying, evolution doesn't make these kinds of predictions. What do you want it to do? Given a set of selective conditions that would favor a given variation, evolution makes no prediction about whether or not that variation will occur. Again, you seem to be demanding that evolution explain something that it doesn't.\n \n And as I've also said more than once, mutation can explain where the novelty comes from. Even a very simple system can be novel. Now how does complexity come to be? A simpler system has to be spread and maintained -- which natural selection explains. That system then needs to undergo further mutation, subject to more selection; and then yet further mutation, subject to even more selection; and so on.\n \n I feel to see any problem here. What evolution explains is how the organisms in question -- the whole population, the \"species\" -- take on the features that they have: variation plus selection, over and over and over. That is evolution, and it involves both mutation and selection. Where is the problem with any of this?\n \n \nTherefore random mutation + natural selection must cause novel systems in the time interval and given the circumstances stated.\n\n \n It must cause them to spread through and be maintained within populations.\n \n \nThe time interval is the past 4 billion years, the circumstances is the natural world.\n\n \n Well, 4 billion years is time for a lot of variations to accumulate, eh?\n \n But \"the natural world\" is rather too vague as a set of circumstances. The natural world varies quite a lot, in biologically relevant ways.\n \n \nAgain I draw a relationship with mutations by themselves, evolution does not predict mutations it relies on them.\n\n \n And nobody has ever said otherwise.\n \n I fail to see why anything you are here discussing is in any way a problem for evolution, as it is understood by the vast run of evolutionary biologists you seem to be criticizing.\n \n \nIf a student asked \"why are there mutations\" you would not answer \"Evolution produces them\", you would give the bio-chemical reasons why various mutations occur.\n\n \n Indeed I would.\n \n \nIf a student asked \"Why is this moth changing color\" you could answer \"evolution produced the change\".\n\n \n Yes and no. If we're talking about \"this moth,\" as an individual, then no: any \"change\" it has undergone should be explained in terms of mutation (or just normal variation, depending on the possible alleles). But If we're talking about \"this moth,\" as a population -- if we mean \"Why is this whole species (interbreeding population) becoming different than its ancestors?\" -- then yes: start examining the mutations and/or variations, and also the selective effects of the environment. These will provide you with the key to understanding why it's now different than it was before.\n \n It is very important to distinguish the individual and the population. Evolution is about the latter.\n \n \nYou want to treat novel systems like mutations, and you have made the comparison many times; saying that 'of course it doesn't predict individual mutations' and 'I am ok with a mutation forming the system'; yet you are not willing to cede what you do about other mutations.\n\n \n I fail to see how I am treating the formation of \"novel systems\" differently from any other form of mutation. Please clarify.\n \n Please also clarify the degree of complexity that a \"novel system\" must possess. I would think they could be quite simple, and that even a simple novel system could provide a selective advantage. Yes?\n \n \nWhy is it evolved if minimal function appears as opposed to some other benefit or detriment?\n\n \n Please note: \"appears\" is not what evolution is about -- or rather, it is only the \"mutation\" part, and is only the first step in explaining why a species comes to have the features it does.\n \n And again, I would like to know just what degree of complexity \"minimal function\" requires.\n \n \nWhat about the kind that are beneficial because they are novel systems?\n\n \n What about them? I don't see your point. They're mutations, same as anything else.\n \n \nThat is natural selection.\n\n \n That's the relevant part in this case, yes. I hardly think this means that evolution isn't the explanation, just because mutation is also involved with explaining how the feature emerged in the first place.\n \n \nThe persistence of a benefit is not the part I am challenging.\n \n Remember the bio-wheels?\n \n Well they would be of benefit and they would persist, can evolution produce them?\n\n \n First of all, I have no idea what \"bio-wheels\" are.\n \n Second, clarify what you mean by \"produce,\" and whether you are applying it to individuals or populations.\n \n Third and finally, I don't think there's any reason to assume that a feature like \"bio-wheels\" or anything else admits of an unqualified \"would be of benefit\" characterization. There are always trade-offs.\n \n \nThat question is equivalent to can a series of beneficial mutations lead in a coherent direction towards the wheels?\n\n \n I don't know what \"bio-wheels\" are, but even so: in principle, I don't see why not. The fact the mutations are \"beneficial\" means that each step in the series is being selected. We have a series of mutations, with natural selection: evoluion.\n \n On the other hand, I'm not sure what you mean by \"coherent.\" In order to wind up with \"bio-wheels,\" does every step have to be selected for function as a bio-wheel? Is that your idea?\n \n \nand evolution does not produce the sum of mutations in species if it selects the individual mutations because of the sum?\n\n \n But mutations aren't selected because of the way they'll eventually fit into a series. They are selected because of what they're doing right now.\n \n Sorry if I misunderstood. This sentence didn't make much sense to me.\n \n \nSo if it appears it was evolved?\n\n \n No, if it becomes the norm for an entire population it is evolved, whether it is selected or not. We've only been talking about adaptive evolution, but there are non-adaptive aspects, and I edited to clarify.\n \n \nSo would you say that no variation evolves, but it's a matter of statistics if they appear.\n\n \n In an individual, so far as we know, it's a matter of chance whether any variant appears. Mutations aren't predictable at the individual level, nor are variations within the normal range of variation available for a given feature.\n \n I emphasize again: at the individual level. Mutations do happen at measurable rates across populations, much as the half-life of a radioactive substance works. This is where \"statistics\" comes in. But for individuals, they're random.\n \n \nYet you can't seem to get around the fact that I have stated a thousand times, that selection cannot exist for a non-existent systems.\n \n How was there selection for a flagellum before it had minimal function Matthew?\n\n \n I've tried to explain this before, and it's not making headway. At the risk of wasting my time again:\n \n You're acting like we either have a minimally functional flagellum, or no structure at all. This black-and-white line is what I'm calling into question.\n \n What I have repeatedly tried to point out is, a structure that is selected for some other purpose could nonetheless have features that would make it minimally functional as a flagellum, even if it is not used as a flagellum. It's no different in principle than the fact that the human hand has been selected for purposes like grasping or fine manipulation, but can also be used for swimming.\n \n The structure to be selected does exist already. But it doesn't have to exist as a flagellum. And because it does exist, selection that would favor its use as a flagellum can act upon it.\n \n A few further quick points about this:\n \n 1. This is co-option. But the structure could come to exist via mutation, too, and the point is the same either way. \n \n 2. I am not committed to the notion that complexity could come about via one mutation. I am, however, committed to the notions that (a) simpler features can provide selective advantages, and that (b) more complex features can evolve via a series of selectively advantageous variations of those simpler features, even when the function of the more complex feature ends up being quite different from its precursors.\n \n 3. Selection pressures can pre-exist the structures that come to meet them. The pressure for something that could be used as a flagellum exists simply because their is an environment in which a flagellum could be used for motility. It does not imply that any given organism will develop a flagellum, though. The selection pressure might exist -- and drive the organism extinct if the requisite variation never occurs.\n \n That's about all I have to say about this. I don't see that any of it is some piece of metaphysical ridiculousness.\n \n \nCould there be a direction or is it coincidence?\n\n \n It's both. That a beneficial variation happens is a \"coincidence,\" for that individual. But to the extent that this variation provides a survival-and-reproduction advantage to the organism, it's going to spread through the organism's offspring, and through their offspring, and so on, and this is definitely a \"direction.\"\n \n Or to sum it up: direction, from natural selection; coincidence, from mutation.\n \n And of course, mutation plus natural selection equals evolution.\n \n \nYes I know systems can have multiple functions....\n\n \n But you ignore this point every time you ask the flagellum question, as above. A system can be selected for one function, that it does perform. It can, \"coincidentally,\" be used to perform another function, for which it provides no selective advantage. But if selection pressures change, the fact that it can do the other function can be relevant.\n \n I'm sorry that I've repeated it so many times, because it obviously frustrates you. But you seem not to see why I keep mentioning it. The structure that comes to be a flagellum assuredly needs to exist, but it need not already be used as a flagellum.\n \n \nI also know life exists.\n \n That doesn't prove multiple systems evolved or that life evolved.\n\n \n No argument there. But I see no purpose to this as a response.\n \n \nWhy would such a shift occur?\n\n \n Two answers:\n \n First, \"because selection pressures change.\" The environment is not static, and when conditions change, different functions become more or less advantageous. One function, formerly useful, may now be unnecessary. Another funciton, formerly pointless, may now become all-important.\n \n Second, \"but it wouldn't necessarily have to happen.\" There is an element of contingency here. Just because a structure could be used a certain way, doesn't mean that it would. And as always, at the level of the individual, it's a matter of chance. There is no rule that says a land animal has to use its feet to swim. This is so even when selection pressures favor swimming -- in which case, if no individuals use their feet to swim, the species is in trouble.\n \n \nYou are wrong to see no difference between unrelated selection and selection towards a system.\n\n \n And you are wrong to think I see none.\n \n A foot is selected for walking (or other terrestrial movement). It can enable swimming, even if it is not selected for it. At a later time, it can be selected for swimming.\n \n What's the problem with any of this? The foot was not initially selected for swimming, and then it was. Was the foot always destined to be a swimming appendage? Perhaps in some metaphysical sense, but there's no reason to suppose so just because that's how it ended up being used.\n \n \nAlright you have explain how benefit can be spread through a population, but I asked for the evolution of a structure.\n\n \n And this is just equivocation on \"evolution.\" I'm talking about populations, because that's what evolution talks about. You seem to be talking about how a structure comes to be in an individual, and that's not a matter of evolution.\n \n Like I said: semantics.\n \n \nYou implied that there is no further pattern besides instantaneous benefit.\n \n That is what selection cares about but that is not the only pattern.\n\n \n What other patterns is evolution -- random variation plus natural selection -- supposed to care about? The randomness of variation isn't a pattern: it's random. The patterns produced by selection are thus the patterns that are seen through evolution, because that's the other part of it.\n \n Evolution doesn't rule out the possibility of other patterns, of course. But they're not evolutionary patterns.\n \n Could you give me an example of the sort of pattern that is being overlooked here?",

I don't see your point. They're mutations, same as anything else.\n\n Do they evolve? Answer without pronouns please.\n \n \nThat's the relevant part in this case, yes. I hardly think this means that evolution isn't the explanation, just because mutation is also involved with explaining how the feature emerged in the first place.\n\n If you are talking about a single mutation the only thing that 'evolved' was its existence in the rest of the population.\n \n I am concerned with biology that evolved, not just spread.\n \n \nSecond, clarify what you mean by \"produce,\" and whether you are applying it to individuals or populations.\n\n Always populations. Have you forgotten that selection always occurs in individuals as well?\n \n \nThird and finally, I don't think there's any reason to assume that a feature like \"bio-wheels\" or anything else admits of an unqualified \"would be of benefit\" characterization. There are always trade-offs.\n\n Tradeoffs yes but it would be beneficial in many environments.\n \n \nI don't know what \"bio-wheels\" are, but even so: in principle, I don't see why not. The fact the mutations are \"beneficial\" means that each step in the series is being selected. We have a series of mutations, with natural selection: evoluion.\n\n Yes that is it, a series!\n \n Each moving closer to the goal, to the ideal phenotype.\n \n \nOn the other hand, I'm not sure what you mean by \"coherent.\" In order to wind up with \"bio-wheels,\" does every step have to be selected for function as a bio-wheel? Is that your idea?\n\n Yes, for if that is not the case there is no reason to expect selection to move in that direction.\n \n Coherent basically means the selection will not get side tracked by I don't know... maybe the function of the proposed precursor system.\n \n \nBut mutations aren't selected because of the way they'll eventually fit into a series. They are selected because of what they're doing right now.\n\n Technically we know that natural selection cannot see the future, but we can recognize these trends exist.\n \n Let me ask you a question, if they are never selected 'due' to similarity with a highly functional sequence; then what right have we to expect selection to move genetic material towards those sequences?\n \n \n \nNo, if it becomes the norm for an entire population it is evolved, whether it is selected or not.\n\n Ahh, well then we have been working off different definitions.\n \n What would you like to call the process by which life is understood to advance? (Assuming you think you know why it would advance).\n \n \nI emphasize again: at the individual level. Mutations do happen at measurable rates across populations, much as the half-life of a radioactive substance works. This is where \"statistics\" comes in. But for individuals, they're random.\n\n For populations they are random too, it is what new generations are inherited with that is not.\n \n \nYou're acting like we either have a minimally functional flagellum, or no structure at all. This black-and-white line is what I'm calling into question.\n\n Or no structure at all? There are many structures in the cell you can have your pick.\n \n I say you have a minimally functional flagellum or you can throw out any selection for flagella.\n \n From that point there is no way to explain a flagellum as the result of a predictable process, it is necessarily the result of some random occurrence(s).\n \n \nWhat I have repeatedly tried to point out is, a structure that is selected for some other purpose could nonetheless have features that would make it minimally functional as a flagellum, even if it is not used as a flagellum. It's no different in principle than the fact that the human hand has been selected for purposes like grasping or fine manipulation, but can also be used for swimming.\n\n Perhaps you remember what I said the last time?\n \n \nThe structure to be selected does exist already. But it doesn't have to exist as a flagellum.\n\n To be selected for similarity for a flagellum it does, and if is not it is a coincidental selection, no better conceptually than random mutation.\n \n \nAnd because it does exist, selection that would favor its use as a flagellum can act upon it.\n\n At any given point where it does exist, it has been produced. You're late with a viable explanation.\n \n \n1. This is co-option. But the structure could come to exist via mutation, too, and the point is the same either way. \n\n There we agree, it is equally invalid to cite mutation or co-option as caused by the evolutionary mechanism.\n \n \n2. I am not committed to the notion that complexity could come about via one mutation. I am, however, committed to the notions that (a) simpler features can provide selective advantages, and that (b) more complex features can evolve via a series of selectively advantageous variations of those simpler features, even when the function of the more complex feature ends up being quite different from its precursors.\n\n Which means you are committed to the notion that every functional domain in biology has a minimal function which you envision as possible via one mutation (or equivalent selective force).\n \n \n3. Selection pressures can pre-exist the structures that come to meet them. The pressure for something that could be used as a flagellum exists simply because their is an environment in which a flagellum could be used for motility. It does not imply that any given organism will develop a flagellum, though. The selection pressure might exist -- and drive the organism extinct if the requisite variation never occurs.\n\n Correct\n \n \nThat's about all I have to say about this. I don't see that any of it is some piece of metaphysical ridiculousness.\n\n The idea of prediction, cause and effect is metaphysical ridiculousness?\n \n A dozen hypothetical scientific theories just popped into my head to prove the illogic of ignoring the idea of abstract prediction.\n \n \nIt's both. That a beneficial variation happens is a \"coincidence,\" for that individual. But to the extent that this variation provides a survival-and-reproduction advantage to the organism, it's going to spread through the organism's offspring, and through their offspring, and so on, and this is definitely a \"direction.\"\n\n So the existence of a novel system is a 'coincidence' but its prevalence is selection.\n \n I got that.\n \n I am challenging those who say its existence is due to evolution.\n \n If you are not one of those people, please stop wasting your time.\n \n \nBut you ignore this point every time you ask the flagellum question, as above. A system can be selected for one function, that it does perform. It can, \"coincidentally,\" be used to perform another function, for which it provides no selective advantage. But if selection pressures change, the fact that it can do the other function can be relevant.\n\n Indeed, but the coincidental conference of function is not the product of evolution.\n \n \nI'm sorry that I've repeated it so many times, because it obviously frustrates you. But you seem not to see why I keep mentioning it.\n\n Oh I know why you keep mentioning it, without co-option everything tumbles.\n \n I am frustrated because as I said before the attack on co-option requires that you keep several premises in mind and it for some reason (am guessing sub-conscious avoidance) it takes a long time of saying the same thing before people consider the big picture.\n \n In other words I have been through this before, and it always ends one of two ways; the guy understands or they give up.\n \n Now of course that could happen if I was wrong too but needless to say I don't believe that's the case.\n \n It should be apparent to you though if you teach logic the fundamental shift between 'this happens for this reason' and the 'it's possible' of co-option.\n \n You are going from knowledge to ignorance, and in fact co-option when jammed into the place evolution is claimed to fill is nothing more than a bizarre appeal to ignorance.\n \n \nThe structure that comes to be a flagellum assuredly needs to exist, but it need not already be used as a flagellum.\n\n sigh, again; it depends on what you mean by need.\n \n The spontaneous generation of any biological system needs nothing, it is theoretically possible for any series of mutations selected or otherwise to produce and DNA sequence.\n \n I say it need be used as a flagellum if that is what the selective direction is.\n \n and I say that there needs to be a selective direction towards a flagellum to predict movement towards a flagellum.\n \n Again, do not confuse the fact that we are talking about the flagellum to assert that I am speaking about a specific system.\n \n Those statements will work equally well if 'flagellum' is replaced by a variable representing any biological system.\n \n \nNo argument there. But I see no purpose to this as a response.\n\n The purpose is to attack the point you seemed to be making, that since a system can have multiple functions that means a system must be able to evolve multiple functions.\n \n \n\n First, \"because selection pressures change.\" The environment is not static, and when conditions change, different functions become more or less advantageous. One function, formerly useful, may now be unnecessary. Another funciton, formerly pointless, may now become all-important.\n\n Forgetting time again, if the selection pressure changes to favor a previously useless but existent function that does not mean the function came into being.\n \n \nAnd you are wrong to think I see none.\n\n Why do you use selection for previous systems in conjunction with co-option as equivalent to selecting towards the final system?\n \n \nA foot is selected for walking (or other terrestrial movement). It can enable swimming, even if it is not selected for it. At a later time, it can be selected for swimming.\n\n Yes, note it can do both.\n \n \nWhat's the problem with any of this? The foot was not initially selected for swimming, and then it was. Was the foot always destined to be a swimming appendage? Perhaps in some metaphysical sense, but there's no reason to suppose so just because that's how it ended up being used.\n\n From the moment the selection pressure for swimming became more relevant than for terrestrial movement, as far as selection is concerned 'it is destined to be a swimming appendage', it's destiny contingent on the selection pressures that exist but still clearly a coherent direction exists for a time.\n \n \nAnd this is just equivocation on \"evolution.\" I'm talking about populations, because that's what evolution talks about. You seem to be talking about how a structure comes to be in an individual, and that's not a matter of evolution.\n\n Yet every individual inherits his species DNA, DNA which is claimed to be the product of evolution itself.\n \n \n \nCould you give me an example of the sort of pattern that is being overlooked here?\n\n The pattern of coherent change towards a more functional sequence, a direct result of any series of mutations being beneficial because they improve the function causing the benefit.\n \n Back to the fluke, NS doesn't care that every step it selects is making the limb more like a fluke but that concept is necessary to understanding why evolution would produce a fluke.",

   "Matthew, you described it all so clearly that even I finally got it... and not being even remotely a biology wonk, a lot of this discussion has till now been like listening to people speaking in tongues.\n \n Let me hypothesize an example, and you tell me if I'm getting it right...\n \n Imagine a more or less elliptical microscopic organism in a fluid environment. One organism randomly turns out to have a slightly pointy end (mutation). It turns out this enables it to move through the fluid more efficiently, like the prow of a ship. Because of this, its able to survive a bit longer than its fellows, and reproduce maybe an extra time or two (benefit).\n \n At least some of these offspring inherit the pointy trait, who pass it along on to their decendants, and so on, and so on, to the point where pointy-shaped organisms dominate the population because of the reproductive benefit (selection).\n \n Then one pops up that's a little pointier than the others (random mutation again), and because its increased hydrodynamism makes it even better at moving around, the whole business begins again (over a VERY long period of time) until the whole population consists of pointier organisms.\n \n Then a mutation pops up that's pointier still, and so on and so on, till they get about as pointy as they're going to get without diminishing returns setting in as far as hydrodynamism goes... \n \n But then one of them randomly twitches his pointy end, which is now almost stringy, and lo and behold, survives longer by moving in the opposite direction, with what was formerly the \"prow of the ship\" instead being used to propel it from behind. (This is \"co-option,\" right?)\n \n And then of course, THIS variation spreads through the population, and a million or so years later, what was first a bump has become a flagellum.\n \n Tell me if I'm following you, and correct me if I got anything wrong.",

   "Then connect them.\n\n \n Good grief. The connection between organisms' genes and their other features, from bacterial flagella to whale's flukes, is so well-established at this point, I take them to need no further connection. Not in general, anyway. The details are still being investigated, but that's a \"how,\" not a \"whether.\"\n \n Species possess different features, which is a function of their divergent DNA. And this is why it makes sense to think of evolution in the sense of the biologists' definition, and the average Joe's understanding.\n \n \nThen say it explicitly, \"evolution does not predict the advancement of life\".\n\n \n I'm not going to say this at all, because I think your terms are incredibly loaded. What qualifies as the \"advancement\" of life? Are you talking about the diversification of species? the better adaptedness of a given species as compared to its ancestors? what?\n \n \nSo evolution is the theory by which life stays advanced not became advanced?\n\n \n Again, you're being very ambiguous. \"Advanced\" in what sense? \"Life\" for individuals or populations? Same lineage or different? What environmental conditions?\n \n Until you clarify what \"the advancement of life\" is, I have no idea how to answer the question.\n \n \nYes I know you think that, and not to put too fine a point on it; you haven't taken biology in a while.\n\n \n And when did you last take biology?\n \n Besides, remember how you reacted when I said you didn't understand natural selection?... \"Blah blah blah,\" \"If I had a dime,\" etc, etc. It was all quite indignant.\n \n What do you suggest I should do in response to the above?\n \n \nI stand by what I said though, I will not discuss the fitness landscape and the odds before we have resolved (and by resolved I mean I see you type it out) what exactly evolution can produce.\n\n \n And I don't think you're being clear even now about what you think evolution ought to \"produce.\" What does this term mean, in the context you're employing it?\n \n \nand unless you are ignoring pathways and all previous selection events, 'how it appears' should be themselves preserved mutations.\n \n\n \n Exactly. Preserved and spread by natural selection. That's all part of evolution. Each step along the way begins as a mutation, but then takes off through the rest of the population as a result of natural selection. What's being ignored?\n \n \nVariations don't evolve, but structures do.\n\n \n Bollocks. Genes vary, and genes are the recipes for organismic features, which vary accordingly. A population's set of genes changes as a result of random variation and selection, and so does its set of features. The two are quite intimately linked.\n \n \nYou cannot explain the final system if you disconnect all the selection events that led to it.\n\n \n I am not in any way disconnecting the selection events. I'm just saying that not every selection event had to be aimed at what ends up being the final product.\n \n For example: The fins of the archaic lobe-fin fish that ended up being homologous to our arms were not aimed in those very fish at becoming our arms. They were selected on the basis of their utility as fins for the fish that possessed them. And so on for each stage.\n \n \nAt your leisure, just admit anything that forms without selection for it was not evolved.\n\n \n I won't do this, because genetic drift is a real evolutionary phenomenon -- it results in changes in allele frequencies, which (believe it or not) are correlated to changes in organisms' features -- but it's not selection.\n \n \nI am concerned with biology that evolved, not just spread.\n\n \n AND THIS STATEMENT IS WHY I THINK YOU ARE EQUIVOCATING ON THE TERM \"EVOLUTION.\"\n \n \nYes that is it, a series!\n \n Each moving closer to the goal, to the ideal phenotype.\n\n \n This is metaphysics, not biology. \"Ideal phenotype?\" Real genotypes have real consequences for real phenotypes living in real environments. This is quite enough to explain how evolution really works.\n \n If such \"ideal phenotypes\" exist, then it's up to you to define what they are, and prove that they exist and play a role in evolution. I see no reason to think that they are there at all.\n \n \nYes, for if that is not the case there is no reason to expect selection to move in that direction.\n\n \n Guess what? Evolution isn't predictable. It twists and turns and does surprising things. Explainable things, after the fact. But not predictable things, beforehand.\n \n This is because mutation/variation is random, and because environmental conditions/selection pressures change.\n \n \nCoherent basically means the selection will not get side tracked by I don't know... maybe the function of the proposed precursor system.\n\n \n Well, sorry, but such \"side-tracking\" happens all the time. The organisms that survive and reproduce in virtue of their features don't think of it as side-tracking of course.\n \n \nTechnically we know that natural selection cannot see the future, but we can recognize these trends exist.\n\n \n But we can recognize them only after the fact. And the trends are always alterable, even reversible. There is no reason why a given structure has to keep evolving in the same direction forever. Selection pressures change.\n \n \nLet me ask you a question, if they are never selected 'due' to similarity with a highly functional sequence; then what right have we to expect selection to move genetic material towards those sequences?\n\n \n None at all. Evolution doesn't say \"here's where the species is going.\" Randomness of variation prevents that, as does the everchanging nature of the environment.\n \n \nAhh, well then we have been working off different definitions.\n\n \n That certainly seems to be the case. You seem to want evolution to involve metaphysical assumptions about things like \"ideal phenotypes\" or \"advances.\"\n \n \nWhat would you like to call the process by which life is understood to advance? (Assuming you think you know why it would advance).\n\n \n Assuming I know what \"advance\" means in this context....\n \n \nI say you have a minimally functional flagellum or you can throw out any selection for flagella.\n\n \n But what if something that is minimally functional as x is also highly functional as y? What if y is what has been selectively advantageous so far, and x is selectively irrelevant? What if conditions change, so that y becomes less important and x more?\n \n There is no reason why selection for a flagellum has to be operative from the beginning in order for it to be operative eventually.\n \n \nFrom that point there is no way to explain a flagellum as the result of a predictable process, it is necessarily the result of some random occurrence(s).\n\n \n It is in part the result of random occurrences, namely individual instances of beneficial mutation or variation. But it is also the result of natural selection working on generations of organisms that possess the structure taht becomes a flagellum.\n \n In that sense, the flagellum's existence is quite explainable. It is not, however, predictable. If we were able to observe bacteria before the existence of the flagellum, I sincerely doubt we'd be able to predict it, because we couldn't know what mutations were going to happen under what conditions. But we would be able to explain it.\n \n \nTo be selected for similarity for a flagellum it does, and if is not it is a coincidental selection, no better conceptually than random mutation.\n\n \n \"Coincidental selection?\" What does that even mean? When I said similarity to a flagellum was coincidental, I said that the structure was being selected for something else at that time. That's precisely why the similarity to flagellum was a coincidence.\n \n Meanwhile, what's wrong with coincidences, or with random mutation? They are part of evolution: only a part, but a necessary part.\n \n \nWhich means you are committed to the notion that every functional domain in biology has a minimal function which you envision as possible via one mutation (or equivalent selective force).\n\n \n Yup. So what? We're only talking about \"minimal\" function, after all. And you're not being very clear about what \"minimal\" means.\n \n \nThe idea of prediction, cause and effect is metaphysical ridiculousness?\n\n \n Not what I said, of course. Go back and reread.\n \n I've already explained why evolution does make predictions about where evolution is going to go from now. Here I will merely advise against the fallacy of reading the present into the past, as if the former were somehow the predictable outcome of the latter. This isn't true of human history, and it's not true of evolutionary history, either.\n \n \nthe coincidental conference of function is not the product of evolution.\n\n \n Nope. But it is a part of the evolutionary picture: mutation plus natural selection. If you want to say that things that only fall on one side of this process, even as they undergo the whole process repeatedly -- mutation, selection, mutation, selection, mutation, selection, mutation, selection... -- aren't evolution, then be my guest. But don't pretend that this reflects some deep-seated flaw with how people conceive of evolution.\n \n \nI am frustrated because as I said before the attack on co-option requires that you keep several premises in mind and it for some reason (am guessing sub-conscious avoidance) --\n\n \n Thanks for that little ad hominem! Shall I share with you my guesses about your motives?... But I digress.\n \n \n-- it takes a long time of saying the same thing before people consider the big picture.\n\n \n What big picture? What's being missed here?\n \n \nIn other words I have been through this before, and it always ends one of two ways; the guy understands or they give up.\n\n \n Could they give up because they understand, and honestly think your case against co-option is poor? I do.\n \n \nIt should be apparent to you though if you teach logic the fundamental shift between 'this happens for this reason' and the 'it's possible' of co-option.\n\n \n Indeed I do. In order to prove that any instance of putative co-option is what actually happened, one needs evidence. I have never claimed otherwise, when presenting my hypothetical sequences.\n \n \nYou are going from knowledge to ignorance, and in fact co-option when jammed into the place evolution is claimed to fill is nothing more than a bizarre appeal to ignorance.\n\n \n Not so. Unlike me, qualified biologists actually search out the evidence that co-option not only could have but did happen.\n \n \nFrom the moment the selection pressure for swimming became more relevant than for terrestrial movement, as far as selection is concerned 'it is destined to be a swimming appendage', it's destiny contingent on the selection pressures that exist but still clearly a coherent direction exists for a time.\n\n \n And I'm sorry, but I don't believe that such a \"destiny\" adds anything to the picture. Real variations and real selection pressures are quite sufficient to explain what happens, without appeal to an idealized phenotypic destiny.\n \n You seem to want a very metaphysically loaded version of biology, my friend.",

One organism randomly turns out to have a slightly pointy end (mutation). It turns out this enables it to move through the fluid more efficiently, like the prow of a ship. Because of this, its able to survive a bit longer than its fellows, and reproduce maybe an extra time or two (benefit).\n \n At least some of these offspring inherit the pointy trait, who pass it along on to their decendants, and so on, and so on, to the point where pointy-shaped organisms dominate the population because of the reproductive benefit (selection).\n \n Then one pops up that's a little pointier than the others (random mutation again), and because its increased hydrodynamism makes it even better at moving around, the whole business begins again (over a VERY long period of time) until the whole population consists of pointier organisms.\n \n Then a mutation pops up that's pointier still, and so on and so on, till they get about as pointy as they're going to get without diminishing returns setting in as far as hydrodynamism goes... \n \n But then one of them randomly twitches his pointy end, which is now almost stringy, and lo and behold, survives longer by moving in the opposite direction, with what was formerly the \"prow of the ship\" instead being used to propel it from behind. (This is \"co-option,\" right?)\n \n And then of course, THIS variation spreads through the population, and a million or so years later, what was first a bump has become a flagellum.\n \n Tell me if I'm following you, and correct me if I got anything wrong.\n\n Well you got the flagellum wrong.\n \n \nive already explained this. if a change in environment requires an organism to have a certain function (example: be better tree climbers) and a current function with a small modification has the ability to fulfill that function, even basically, it will be selected for.\n\n Answer the question please.\n \n \nhonestly, i think freedom is waaaaay overthinking the whole topic. its such a simple concept, that seemingly anyone can get it.\n\n I think you are under thinking the whole topic.

The idea of production is basically the event that occurs between existance and non-existance to cause the latter; We say an electron shifting energy levels produces a photon, yet in a matter of time almost undetectable that photon was probably absorbed by another element/molecule. It was in no way preserved by the electron shifting orbit and it's preservation for any interval of time is not a precondition of it's production nor a consequence either.\n \n The process of production is necessarily the process of forming existance.\n \n I am going to skip ahead just for one paragraph here and say that there is no law that says the preservation of mutations that were not produced by evolution cannot produce something else, and in fact it is my belief that this possibility is the lynch-pin connecting the official definition of evolution with any possible powers of production it may have.\n \n systems-noun \n 1. an assemblage or combination of things or parts forming a complex or unitary whole: a mountain system; a railroad system. \n 2. any assemblage or set of correlated members: a system of currency; a system of shorthand characters. \n 3. an ordered and comprehensive assemblage of facts, principles, doctrines, or the like in a particular field of knowledge or thought: a system of philosophy. \n 4. a coordinated body of methods or a scheme or plan of procedure; organizational scheme: a system of government. \n 5. any formulated, regular, or special method or plan of procedure: a system of marking, numbering, or measuring; a winning system at bridge. \n 6. due method or orderly manner of arrangement or procedure: There is no system in his work. \n 7. the world or universe. \n 8. Astronomy . \n a. a number of heavenly bodies associated and acting together according to certain natural laws: the solar system. \n b. a hypothesis or theory of the disposition and arrangements of the heavenly bodies by which their phenomena, motions, changes, etc., are explained: the Ptolemaic system; the Copernican system. \n 9. Biology . \n a. an assemblage of organs or related tissues concerned with the same function: the nervous system; the digestive system. \n b. the entire human or animal body considered as a functioning unit: an ingredient toxic to the system. \n 10. one's psychological makeup, esp. with reference to desires or preoccupations: to get something out of one's system. \n 11. a method or scheme of classification: the Linnean system of plants. \n 12. ( sometimes initial capital letter ) the prevailing structure or organization of society, business, or politics or of society in general; establishment (usually prec. by the ): to work within the system instead of trying to change it. \n 13. Geology . a major division of rocks comprising sedimentary deposits and igneous masses formed during a single geologic period. \n 14. Physical Chemistry . a combination of two or more phases, as a binary system, each of which consists of one or more substances, that is attaining or is in equilibrium. \n 15. Computers . a working combination of hardware, software, and data communications devices. \n 16. Checkers . either of the two groups of 16 playing squares on four alternate columns. \n \n I think that the biology definition needs to translating to the context (:P) but I would like to add that since we are certainly going to be talking about sub-cellular systems sometimes that the conditions of organs or tissues should not be construed to exclude microscopic systems, in fact it could be safe to just say proteins and RNA molecules in place of those.\n \n Especially note the 'the same function' part, a system is not just a pile of structures that we delimited into a category for the fun of it.\n \n \nI can't resist addressing this briefly.\n \n Of course he got the flagellum wrong, in its details. And he never claimed to give the true account of how it actually evolved.\n \n But he got the nature of the process right. Small but beneficial mutation, natural selection, passing mutation on to offspring. Repeat, indefinitely. Voila: that's evolution. (Adaptive evolution, at any rate.)\n\n Well in this case I have to disagree, it sounded as if he just took the macroscopic equivalent of limb modification and tried to apply it to a cell.\n \n Behe gets very excited to point out the differences in the thought patterns in considering cells to considering macroscopic organisms and although I don't think it's such an amazing point it is a point.\n \n On the macroscopic level you are dealing with large colonies of cells forming tissues whose shape and character are generally controlled by relatively small growth control sequences.\n \n On the cellular level there are no further building blocks to alter the shape of except proteins, if the cell changes shape or twitches you cannot explain it away as an aberrant muscle or a slightly modified growth sequence.\n \n The shape is controlled by the cellular skeleton, every step must be carried out like it was an engineering process, at the risk of sounding cliche we are no longer in the wondrous world of magical tissues that simply function, we have run out of objects to delegate explanation too and we must now give (and do see) answers in terms of molecular engineering.\n \n A twitch?\n \n How complicated could that be?\n \n Well how complicated would it be to twitch the back of a hot air balloon?\n \n MacGyver?\n \n You are talking motor proteins, modified tubulin like proteins, proteins to assemble the filaments correctly, proteins to place the protein motors in the right place, proteins to control the use of energy, proteins to signal the stop of construction, proteins to connect the elements, most of which have to be unique to the system or else they would destroy or at the very least be rendered ineffective by non-specific binding.\n \n As well as the unrelated preconditions of an environment that would favor the modification, and sequences that can be modified without detriment for all.\n \n \nto answer this question, thats not how i would accurately define evolution, i think there are more processes that make up the entire process of evolution, just advancement of systems is not enough. however, the advancement of life by small changes in allele frequencies inherited over a very long period of time does make sense in the light of evolution.\n\n May I ask what change in DNA would not be considered evolution (I have noticed you have used the word selection about so called neutral mutations, could you explain how this is possible or are you just using the word selection as equivalent to inherited?)",

   "Um I see apparent contradictions in your post.\n\n Me too. And while it causes me to grind my teeth to nubs to agree with you, you do have some valid points.\n \n1. d'oh! drift is one process within natural selection... there is no selecting within drift.\n\n Your objection is correct. Genetic drift is not a process within natural selection. Genetic drift is a completely separate, observed mechanism of evolution. One has to wonder how anyone can claim that genetic drift is a part of natural selection that is without selection.\n \n2. \"genetic evolution can be defined as any change in the DNA of a population, so i suppose a neutral mutation that does not get selected for can be considered outside of the evolution definition\"\n\n Again, your objection is correct. Evolution does not imply the effect of a mutation. Evolution means that the genetic makeup of a population has changed (i.e., allele frequencies have changed over generations). Whether or not a mutation is subjected to natural selection is another matter.\n \n It seems that \"evolution\" is being conflated with \"natural selection.\" They are not the same. Natural selection, along with 8 other mechanisms, is but one mechanism of evolution. Not all evolution is due to natural selection.\n \nJust because a mutation is not selected does not mean it disappears, if you define evolution as any change in the DNA of a population it will include unselected mutations.\n\n Indeed. I have now called my dentist to arrange for false teeth, since I agree with you.\n \nThen you follow with: \"I suppose a neutral mutation that does not get selected for can be considered outside of the evolution definition, but at the same time it still is because its still a change in DNA\"\n \n Do you mean your supposition or your statement to be true?\n\n God only knows. Evolution is any change in the genetic makeup of a population. Whether or not it is selected for or against is irrelevant. If it is a change in the genetic makeup of a population over generations, it is evolution.\n \nWell let's start.\n\n Oh, let's!\n \n\"genetic evolution can be defined as any change in the DNA of a population\"\n\n Roughly, yes.\n \nIf you meant that statement than [sic] the divine intervention that behe [sic] speculates on would be evolution.\n\n No it wouldn't. Evolutionary biology is a science. Science attempts to explain observed natural phenomena by natural mechanisms. That is why it is called methodological naturalism. It is a method of investigation of natural phenomena that rejects magical explanations.\n \nIf you want to add the condition 'natural' that may still include processes and occurrence besides random mutation + natural selection, which means I have no argument about it.\n\n I have no idea what that says. There are several mechanisms of evolution besides mutation and natural selection. You seem to have a tunnel mentality about evolution.\n \nMy argument is about random mutation + natural selection, what it can produce; what patterns can be expected from it.\n\n Look around. Of course, only an XXXXX would claim that all evolution is due to mutation and natural selection and nothing more.\n \n So let me issue a challenge.

Not all evolution is due to natural selection.\n\n Pandion, I am willing to agree that evolution from the official definition can mean any genetic change over time, but I have heard what you call 'other mechanisms' before and you are counting subcategories.\n \n There is only one way for genes to change over time and that is mutation with inheritance.\n \n Recombination is just what it sounds like a different combination of genes that still don't change without mutation.\n \n I think sexual selection is certainly a subset of natural selection.\n \n Natural selection is not a mechanism of changing genes over time it is a mechanism filtering what changes are inherited.\n \n The only fundamental alternative to natural selection is unselected inheritance and that is pretty much taken care of by the concept of genetic drift.\n \n Any other 'mechanism' will be various types of mutations combined with types of filtering (natural or none), merely nomenclature to describe the various possibilities, not independent mechanisms.\n \n \nNo it wouldn't.\n \n\n Would you support that because the statements following it certainly don't.\n \n \nI have no idea what that says.

I'm just saying evolution can explain both.)\n\n When I say 'the DNA changes' I am implying that mutation occurred and became standard for the species.\n \n The process of a mutation occurring in an individual and spreading to the population is already integrated, yet you seem to be thinking that I am making some kind of incorrect distinction between individuals and populations because the production of variation is necessarily on the indivudal level.\n \n In one way you are correct, when I say produced I do not mean the production of ubiquity, I mean the actual production of the system, every stage of which necessarily starts out on the level of an individual.\n \n While it would be hopeless to argue that the official definition of evolution makes any claims about the production of anything at all, I will and am arguing that if you claim to explain the existance of a system you must explain it's production (those are equivalent), not the following prevalence that it's benefit conveys.\n \n If you have never thought of any way for random mutation and natural selection to ever do that, then I say you have more fundamental problems than the average joe on this matter.\n \n If I may go back to the example with a companies sales contract, you would literally be claiming that the fact that good products will be bought explains how all products are built when it can only explain why good products are used prevalently.\n \n \n-sigh- I don't know, Freedom. This attempt at trying an \"argument from first principles\" seems to getting a bit bogged down in semantics.\n\n Well it does appear that way but there is unfortunately no way around it, so let's just get through it.\n \n The fastest way is to understand that I am talking about the whole species, when I say production I mean every step including ones that route through individuals. BUT I have never considered and am not now considering the spread of the novel system the stage of the process in question.\n \n It seems to me that you are basically saying that I have to find the problem there or no where else.\n \n You can't complete the process of building a car without putting wheels on it, that does not mean putting wheels on a junkyard chassis will produce a car.\n \n Now you have several times at this poin focused in on the individual and the specific occurrence of any given variation, you have pointed out that the variations themselves can't be produced and I have agreed. If I said nothing further that would mean the whole idea of a process producing any set of modified DNA is doomed, but I do not leave it at that.\n \n There is a possible process over a series of selected mutations that will in essence allow the sum of these unproduced but only preserved changes to produce something.\n \n This is primarily where our misunderstanding stems from, you observe that the only power of natural selection is preservation and standardizing an unproduced change/variation, so you ask (para-phrasing) if that isn't production what is?\n \n I don't think production can exist for any individual mutation because the only non-random mechanism involved technically only operates after the production of the change.\n \n That is why I asked 'can a mutation evolve'? I was trying to cut through this and see if my idea of guided genetic change was where the definition of evolution ended up in your mind.\n \n \nto say Jesus did it when we actually dont know why evolution happens is taking a million steps backwards. there are an infinite things that humanity does not know, and to fill those answers with Jesus or God is not helping out understanding at all, since these questions could very well be answerable by scientific means. Darwin took a big stride by taking something the public already answered as \"God did it\" and re-answering it with something better.\n\n I agree, it is very interesting how easily and precisely respond when faced with the hint of something you are intellectually prepared to deal with.\n \n \nquestion: you said a few things that interest me. first of all, Behe's statements are about God? i was under the assumption that ID has nothing to do with religion; you made sure i understood that when i first joined this forum.\n\n Behe has made statements that he believes God created life and I am pretty sure Behe holds the view that God let things evolve until there was an IC system to be built in which case God popped it into existance and let selection do the rest.\n \n What he apparently fails to understand about his own idea of IC is that every unique system is IC if you are perfectly strict about actual selective direction.\n \n So he would then hold that God created everything.\n \n He however integrates as an unspoken premise that some systems aren't as complicated, that they do not need God only statistically possible mutations.\n \n It would be easier for me if he had treated the whole idea more rigorously, it is very easy to miss the point and think he is claiming 'no evolutionary pathway if it's complicated enough', I claim 'no evolutionary pathway period' with the obvious but unrelated knowledge that some practically possible novel system forming mutations could exist (although I have never seen evidence for one).\n \n Back to the point though, he's a roman cathlolic and I would not be surprised if he finds his own analysis to be easier to digest philosophically because he gets to fall back on mysticism. Behe certainly considers God the designer and he has said as much.\n \n Now when did Behe become equivalent to ID? He believes in ID just like all religious people do.\n \n The distinction between ID and creation myths in general is the reservation of rationality.\n \n Religious people believe that murder is wrong because God told them it is, that does not mean you have to be religious to mean murder is wrong.\n \n Religious people believe in ID because they believe their God(s) created everything (meaning designed and executed), that does not mean you have to believe that God(s) created everything the believe in ID.\n \n What special distinction is there between ID and creationism?\n \n As far as the words go, I don't care it's just a connection of sounds. I do care that a word exists for the concept of an intelligent designer(s) with no further meaning.\n \n \nsecond question: because i recognize Behe's statements as being statements on evolution, that all of a sudden implies that God did it all?\n\n I couldn't parse that question properly I think, if it is equivalent to 'Since behe's statements are on evolution, does that all of a sudden imply that god did it all?\n \n No.\n \n \nim saying what Behe says is wrong by evolutionary terms. \n\n If we are back to IC I would be most interested in hearing what evolutionary terms those are given that he formed his concept on the premise of evolutionary terms and it would be meaningless without them.\n \n \nhe makes a claim which could potentially be added to the modern systhesis, but it is not going to be because it goes against genetics and inheritance\n\n Please support that.\n \n \nif you were to look at it from afar. consider ID and IC definitely goes that route instead.\n\n IC doesn't go any route, it is you who are now implying a dichotomy when you just asked a question that might be said to point out that it is bad logic to prove an explanation by disproving another.\n \n IC is only a problem for a specific incorrect idea, an invalid notion.\n \n All sound negative arguments are.\n \n \nBehe proposes a fully formed system with no process to build it.\n\n He proposed God zapped it into existance. You, matthew, and most evolutionist when faced with the IC analysis propose that it just appeared as some combination of random events.\n \n They both translate to 'fully formed system with no process to built it', and I would choose neither as an explanation.\n \n If it is philosophical projection for Behe to blame God from a religious viewpoint it is the same from an atomist viewpoint to blame random chance.\n \n \n \nthis can be translated into meaning a massive genome change, which genetics/inheritance has proven to be impossible.\n\n Hardly impossible, the only reason I have not claimed spontaneous generation impossible is because it isn't.\n \n No one has any absolute laws on what mutations can happen and at what times.\n \n I know the following is perfectly irrelevant to your point but I have gotten the same many times and from pandion several times on these forums and I am hoping that by stating it here and now I am immunizing myself from further error.\n \n Would you not call a chromosome duplication or the duplication of large sequences 'massive'. Indeed changes including a number of base pairs well large enough to contain a novel system have been observed.\n \n \nbut in no way would all the changes be able to form an entire system all at once.\n\n Why what's stopping that from happening?\n \n \nto have that many mistakes (mutations) in the meiosis process that coincidentally form a perfectly functioning new novel system will get you many laughs from people who understand genetics and inheritance.\n\n and if I were to laugh at you for claiming that coincidentally functions spawn for no reason from structures that had nothing to do with them during their development?\n \n The reason people who understand genetics and inheritance laugh is because it is absurdly unlikely.\n \n Not absurdly unlikely for enough mutations to happen; absurdly unlikely that the right mutations to form a functioning new novel system will happen.\n \n You can then appreciate in part at least my utter frustration when it is indignantly claimed that evolution doesn't need to explain the production of systems only their prevalence, that their production is a premise universally and statistically granted.\n \n I say a process is needed, I say evolution was and is claimed to be that process.\n \n I say that process is and must be identical in every way to the process described by my guided genetic change test.\n \n \n and Behe has, by the way.\n\n He should get less than the evolutionists I have spoken to do because he invokes magic and thereby by passes the need for any rational explanation like one that would neutralize the impossible odds facing such occurrences.\n \n Is it worse to proclaim something happened but it was caused for reasons beyond our understanding because it was done by someone beyond our understanding than to claim that something happened but there are no reasons to cause it?\n \n \nthe idea of a designer is unscientific because first of all, a designer is unnecessary in the evolutionary process and even, apparently in the formation of life.\n\n An explanation does not have to be the sole explanation in order for it to be scientific.\n \n There are multiple ways to get from your house to work, that does not mean walking is unscientific explanation because one can take the bus.\n \n Yet, that is not the case here there are no alternative explanations at this time because evolution does not explain the advancement of life, especially it's formation.\n \n \nthe reasonable argument for the existence of a designer is out.\n\n Bennedict has spoken.\n \n \nso the emphesis is on the evidence for this designer, which is underwhelming to put it nicely. to put it bluntly, there is none at all. if youd like to explain to my how a designer is scientific, im willing to hear it.\n\n #1, we are moving way to fast, we need to slow down and establish premises thoroughly or the same thing is going to happen again.\n \n I take responsibility for my response and I am being complicit in what will probably be more talking past each other in two posts because it is mostly assertion anyway.\n \n I am posting it anyway under the assumption that you would rather I not ignore you, but if you want to actually get somewhere you will try to focus on some specific point of disagreement.\n \n The one I started with is the definitions of various terms I have been using, I then plan to move on to the subject of explanations and processes.",

   "Because asking the average joe 'what theory explains the origin of species' or 'what is the process by which the bio-sphere came to exist' and they are going to tell you evolution.\n\n \n In the first place, evolution does explain the origin of species, and to that extent, it explains how the bio-sphere came to exist with the sets of species that it has. Mutation plus natural selection: that's evolution.\n \n \nIf you will remember I have already identified this disconnect between official definition and what practically everyone assigns to the word.\n\n \n I don't know if it's \"practically everyone.\" But regardless, why accomodate a misunderstanding? Why not correct it? If people are confusing evolution with mutation, then why say this is a problem for evolution, instead of correcting people's misunderstanding of the difference?\n \n I would still like some concrete examples of who is guilty of this, by the way. Appeals to \"the average joe\" or \"practically everyone\" are vague to the point of uselessness.\n \n \nWell let's see.\n \n What process is capable of producing the advancement of life?\n\n \n Evolution produces the adaptive features of species, via a combination of mutation and natural selection. Whether this is an answer to your question, I don't know.\n \n \nI have defined it and elaborated on it, you can't mean that you still don't know what it means.\n\n \n No, I really don't. You have said that you are applying it to species. But I think you're totally equivocal about this. Because most of the time, you seem hung up on the idea of how likely it is that a feature could be produced in single instances -- on how likely it is, say, that a flagellum could be \"produced\" via... what? via mutation? That some lucky individual could go from no flagellum-parts at all to a flagellum?\n \n \nAnyone who thinks novel systems are produced by evolution.\n\n \n Yes, well, guilty. That's me. A species can wind up with a \"novel system\" not possessed by its ancestors. Evolution, i.e., mutation plus natural selection, produces them.\n \n Mutation can produce a beneficial feature for a single individual. Natural selection can cause it to spread across later generations. It can then serve as a basis upon which further beneficial mutations can be built. Voila. It's not magic.\n \n Maybe among all the other vague terms I think we should define more clearly is \"novel.\" \"Novel,\" for what, as compared to what? For an individual compared to its parents? For a species, compared to a dozen generations ago? a thousand? a million? How do we make \"novel\" precise?\"\n \n \nThis randomness is irreconcilable with the idea of a predictable process without any further premises.\n\n \n But what is it that you think that evolution should be able to predict? Mutations are, in their individual occurrence, unpredictable, i.e., random. The paths that evolution will take into the future are, therefore, also unpredictable, i.e., random. None of this is inconsistent with being able to expalin what has happened after the fact.\n \n \nFrom your statements I believe you are claiming that random mutation alone produces all changes in the genome?\n \n Are you saying that?\n\n \n Nope. I have no idea what I could have said that would have given that mistaken impression.\n \n Evolution (adaptive evolution) involves mutation/variation plus natural selection. Clearly, natural selection has a profound effect on genomes.\n \n \nAnd you are not so that must mean that you are not confusing natural selection with production?\n \n That is the production of a system or mutation does not involve natural selection, that is only relevant to the prevalence of the system or mutation?\n\n \n And this is exactly why I think you're equivocating about individuals and populations. I think it is perfectly reasonable to speak of evolution \"producing\" the features of a species, because mutations and/or ordinary features of individuals are then subject to natural selection, and this whole process is what causes species to exist with the features that they have.\n \n So I think production does involve natural selection, when we're talking about how features come to \"exist\" (\"be produced\" in your terminology) in a species.\n \n \nWell see this is why we are getting definitions down, I did not know you had a seperate word for the production of systems, as I said the average person would think that evolution produces new systems in life.\n\n \n Evolution does produce new systems in life: for a species, relative to this or that set of past ancestors. The process involves mutation and selection.\n \n \nExcellent, that is the premise I was trying to establish.\n\n \n There was no need to establish it. It has been well establlished for quite a while now.\n \n \nThe change from sequence A to sequence B is guided if any mutations reducing the genetic differential are selected due to similarity with B.\n\n \n Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but are you saying that \"similarity to B\" produces no benefit to the survival and reproduction of the organism in question, but is selected anyway?\n \n \n1.) You accept my explanations and use of the words production and advancement.\n\n \n Honestly, I'm not sure I do.\n \n \n2.) Variations/Mutations aren't produced by evolution.\n\n \n Mutations certainly aren't. As for variations, though, it will depend on what \"produced\" means. It isn't evolution that causes an individual to possess whatever variants it possesses. But it is evolution that causes species to posses the variants they do.\n \n \n3.) Random mutation without natural selection is random inheritance.\n\n \n I certainly don't accept this. Random mutation is not random inheritance, as mutation and inheritance are different things.",

   "In the first place, evolution does explain the origin of species, and to that extent, it explains how the bio-sphere came to exist with the sets of species that it has. Mutation plus natural selection: that's evolution.\n\n Then it is that claim that I argue against, we can call it evolution or we can call it something else. You choose.\n \n \nI would still like some concrete examples of who is guilty of this, by the way. Appeals to \"the average joe\" or \"practically everyone\" are vague to the point of uselessness.\n\n You are an example, you would use the official definition of evolution, which includes no claims about the production, advancement of anything.\n \n \nYes, well, guilty. That's me. A species can wind up with a \"novel system\" not possessed by its ancestors. Evolution, i.e., mutation plus natural selection, produces them.\n\n By the system appearing randomly then being preserved and spread?\n \n \nMutation can produce a beneficial feature for a single individual. Natural selection can cause it to spread across later generations. It can then serve as a basis upon which further beneficial mutations can be built. Voila. It's not magic.\n\n No it's not, except when it is claimed that natural selection can cause non-beneficial mutations to serve as basis's.\n \n \nMaybe among all the other vague terms I think we should define more clearly is \"novel.\" \"Novel,\" for what, as compared to what? For an individual compared to its parents? For a species, compared to a dozen generations ago? a thousand? a million? How do we make \"novel\" precise?\"\n\n of a new kind; different from anything seen or known before: a novel idea. \n \n A novel system is one that accomplishes a new function/method pair, new meaning not existing in the genome of the species prior to.\n \n \nBut what is it that you think that evolution should be able to predict? \n\n I know what rational evolution predicts, I demand that irrational evolution predict advancement if it is claimed it explains it.\n \n \nNope. I have no idea what I could have said that would have given that mistaken impression.\n\n Describe for me the types of changes that aren't random please.\n \n \nAnd this is exactly why I think you're equivocating about individuals and populations. I think it is perfectly reasonable to speak of evolution \"producing\" the features of a species, because mutations and/or ordinary features of individuals are then subject to natural selection, and this whole process is what causes species to exist with the features that they have.\n\n Meaning evolution never explains the variation, just the prevalence?\n \n \nSo I think production does involve natural selection, when we're talking about how features come to \"exist\" (\"be produced\" in your terminology) in a species.\n\n as step II, it cannot remain step II in all cases if a process is to be established for non-random production.\n \n \nThere was no need to establish it. It has been well establlished for quite a while now.\n\n Very well, do you remember claiming that novel systems arose as variations/mutations?\n \n \nare you saying that \"similarity to B\" produces no benefit to the survival and reproduction of the organism in question, but is selected anyway?\n\n No\n \n \nHonestly, I'm not sure I do.\n\n Then we should not move on, please elaborate on the issues you have with the post in which I posted the definitions.\n \n \nMutations certainly aren't. As for variations, though, it will depend on what \"produced\" means. It isn't evolution that causes an individual to possess whatever variants it possesses. But it is evolution that causes species to posses the variants they do.\n\n Has it occurred to you that every individual is a possessor of the species' genes?\n \n \nI certainly don't accept this. Random mutation is not random inheritance, as mutation and inheritance are different things.\n\n I see, perhaps you could give an example of a non-random inheritance given the conditional?\n \n \nwelcome back Matthew.\n \n i think freedom is still hung up on co-option. i ask again, what is to stop co-option from happening? youve given an answer which has been busted by us, so we return back to the question.\n \n and #2, mutations are not caused by evolution, variations are. a variation is the stage between mutation and full adaptation.\n\n No comment.",

You just described the mutations that will serve as further bases for building the eventual system as \"non-beneficial.\" And that's not actually correct. They are non-beneficial only with respect to the system that eventually comes to be. But they are beneficial with respect to current conditions at the time they come to be, else they wouldn't be selected in the first place.\n \n What is the problem here?\n \n \nof a new kind; different from anything seen or known before: a novel idea. \n \n A novel system is one that accomplishes a new function/method pair, new meaning not existing in the genome of the species prior to.\n\n \n Which doesn't really help. \"Prior to\"... what?

Which is why I referred to natural selection immediately after the point to which you here respond.\n \n \nMeaning evolution never explains the variation, just the prevalence?\n\n \n It never explains why a given variation happens for the first time. It does, however, explain why a variation that happens spreads (or not) through an entire population. I would say that therefore it explains how that variation is \"produced\" (comes to exist, as I understand your usage) as a feature of the species, rather than as a feature of any particular individual.\n \n \nas step II, it cannot remain step II in all cases if a process is to be established for non-random production.\n\n \n I do not understand what this sentence means, let alone how it was to serve as a response to my comment: \"So I think production does involve natural selection, when we're talking about how features come to 'exist' ('be produced' in your terminology) in a species.\"\n \n \nVery well, do you remember claiming that novel systems arose as variations/mutations?\n\n \n Yup. Do you remember that I also claimed that \"novel systems\" could be very simple? I don't think it's remotely possible for something as complex as a flagellum to come into existence as a result of a single mutation. I do, however, think it can come into existence as a result of a whole series of mutations and selection events, leading to a whole series of features, each of which is simple relative to later systems, but each of which qualifies as a \"novel system\" in my book.\n \n \nThen we should not move on, please elaborate on the issues you have with the post in which I posted the definitions.\n\n \n I have pointed out repeatedly that I think your use of \"produce\" is entirely unclear when it comes to individuals and species.\n \n Individuals' features come about -- as the singular, actual features they are -- through developmental processes. Species' features come about -- as the normal, or sometimes varying sets of normal, and actual features they are -- through natural selection acting upon all those individuals' features. You haven't been more specific than saying that production is a matter of causing something to exist. So I see no reason why we can't apply \"production\" to both sorts of process. When it comes to individuals, their features are not produced by evolution. When it comes to species, their features are produced by evolution. This is true even though evolution doesn't produce the features of the individual members of the species itself.\n \n This is no more a problem than saying \"Auto factories produce cars that have tires,\" even though auto factories don't produce tires.\n \n I'm starting to think that your argument might boil down to a fallacy of composition or division.\n \n \nHas it occurred to you that every individual is a possessor of the species' genes?\n\n \n Has it occurred to you that \"the species' genes\" is just a statistical average of the genes of all the individuals that make up the species in the first place?\n \n I think this is the fundamental issue here. Are the individuals basic? or the species?\n \n \nI see, perhaps you could give an example of a non-random inheritance given the conditional?\n\n \n I had no objection to the idea that inheritance is random, i.e., unpredictable. (Though it's not entirely so, given the way that genes tend to be linked on chromosomes. But I digress.)\n \n My objection was to your claim: \"Random mutation without natural selection is random inheritance.\" And I objected on the basis that mutation is not inheritance. The two are hardly identical processes.\n \n -----\n \n Maybe we should call it quits. I don't agree with your terminological choices -- or at minimum, I don't find them clearly defined.

'It's velocity.'\n\n \n For pity's sake. If you can find any instance in which something this preposterous has actually been said, other than in a straw man, I'll be truly impressed.\n \n \nIn which case it is not their selections that are random but the fact that they are parts of novel systems that is.\n\n \n If all that \"random\" means is \"cannot be predicted in advance,\" then I have absolutely no problem with that. It merely implies that whether or not a given system would come to be, and if so, in what form it would come to be, could not be predicted in advance. Since I believe that these are exactly the case, no problem for me.\n \n \nI have said many times the only problem I have with it is that it is no different than assuming mutation alone produced the system.\n\n \n And I think that is an absolutely preposterous representation of the co-option argument. Every time I have set out how the process works, I have said that it includes both mutations and selection events. How you can say that \"mutation plus natural selection\" is \"no different\" from \"mutation alone\" beggars the imagination.\n \n \nWithout the concept of guided genetic change no explaination is possible, only the assertion of possibility.\n\n \n When trying to explain how co-option could work in principle, I have never made any claim to present any example as more than hypothetical. What would move any claim about a particular concrete case of co-option beyond mere hypothesis is empirical evidence.\n \n \nI claim it can cause genetic patterns where those patterns exist on the fitness landscape.\n\n \n Before selection?\n \n I mean, look. If we're talking about patterns that exist after selection has occurred, then we're back where I mentioned before: \"guided genetic change\" is just \"natural selection\" renamed (to suit what purpose, I have no clue).\n \n But if we're talking about patterns that exist before selection, then the burden of proof lies with you to provide evidence that mutations or inheritance or whatever other genetic process you like is already pushing the genes in that direction. This isn't going to settled \"deductively\" or \"conceptually,\" but empirically. And so far as I know, there is no such empirical evidence for such a thing.\n \n This, it seems to me, is where \"guided genetic change\" takes us: either mere semantics, or an unsubstantiated hypothesis.\n \n \nThat 'with respect to the system' is crucial to the explanation of the system, without it natural selection becomes random with respect towards that system.\n\n \n So what? All this means is, the system was not predictable in advance. And this doesn't imply that the existence of systems now or in the past are void of explanation.\n \n \nIf you are selecting for a door no change can be expected to be beneficial for any other reason than because the door functions better afterward.\n\n \n But what if I'm selecting for some feature of a window -- say, width of opening, to allow air through -- and I now find that what I've got works better as a portal for entry and exit?\n \n This is why we keep making the argument about co-option, Freedom. You act as though the only way to end with a functional door is to start with selection for a door. And that is simply false.\n \n \nThat selection pressure is random with respect to any other function.\n\n \n Yes. But so what? Selection in favor of one function can, but need not confer another function, too. As usual, I fail to see why this presents any problem at all, as a matter of principle.\n \n For any concrete case of co-option, there needs to be evidence, not just a statement of possibility. That point I happily concede, now as from the very beginning.\n \n \nand unselected totally random system CAN form a novel system just as parts can randomly assemble a new system.\n\n \n I object to the characterization of the system as \"totally random,\" and of the assembly process as something that happens \"randomly\" alone. Because the system was already the product of mutation plus natural selection, and the assembly process itself consists of further mutation plus natural selection. Since only one half of \"mutation plus natural selection\" is random, I regard your statement as hyperbole.\n \n \nCAN is not good enough, WILL is.\n\n \n It seems to me that you want the actual course of evolution to be necessary. Hence my characterization of you as a metaphysician.\n \n I do not believe that evolution can be used to say what \"will\" happen. Its principles are quite \"good enough\" to say what can happen...\n \n \nCAN is an appeal to odds, WILL is a process and explanation.\n\n \n ...and what happens or happened requires an appeal not to odds, but to evidence.\n \n \nCAN is assertion, WILL is deduction.\n\n \n And DID is induction. Evolution, like all natural sciences, relies on empirical evidence. How it happened is not a matter of deduction.\n \n I make no apologies for discussing what \"could\" or \"can\" happen, as a matter of principle. To repeat: I have never said that such discussions of principles are adequate as explanations of particular phenomena. The fact that the flagellum \"could have\" evolved through such and such sequence of events -- both mutations and selections -- does not establish that it did. For that, we need evidence. Good old fashioned, empirical evidence.\n \n \nThe problem is that an appeal to odds is not an explanation, it is the identification of strict possibility.\n\n \n That's right. Simply saying how likely it is that something could happen is not sufficient to prove that it happened that way.\n \n \nIn the other thread you irrevocably denied appealing to odds...\n\n \n Yup. \n \n \nwhat you do not yet realize is that IC leaves no other recourse.\n\n \n For what? You lost me here.\n \n \nWe are being strict now, no mutation is due to natural selection. Only their persistence.\n\n \n Not just their persistence. Their spread through a population as well. Hence their \"production\" -- their \"coming into existence\" -- as features of a species, rather than just as features of individuals.\n \n Because we're being strict.\n \n \nWhat kind of changes are there besides single mutations?\n\n \n For a species, those wrought by natural selection, to be sure.\n \n \nI am afraid that would be your fault.\n\n \n I don't think so. To wit:\n \n \nIt is perfectly clear, natural selection cannot produce mutation it can produce it's prevalence.\n\n \n And the distribution of \"produce\" is equivocal. Let me rewrite in a way that I could agree with, so as to indicate the nature of the problem.\n \n \"Natural selection cannot produce a mutation in an individual. It can, however, produce a mutation's eventual prevalence in the species to which that individual belongs.\"\n \n Individual, species. Stop equivocating.\n \n \nFor the species to gain the mutation as a whole both it's existance and prevalence must be produced.\n\n \n Same problem. Existence in an individual, prevalence across the species (which really just means existence in the species). Mutation, natural selection. Sub-features of \"evolution.\"\n \n \nAgain you are defining the process of filtering mutations, which does not encompass the production of anything but prevalence.\n\n \n And I say this is semantics. It explains how a feature \"comes to exist\" as a feature of the species. Per your own definition of \"produce,\" it is perfectly reasonable to use the term to describe this.\n \n \nOf course not, but if you want to explain the existance of the car you will need to explain the existance of it's tires.\n \n Meaning you cannot point to an auto-factory and say that produces the car from raw materials.\n \n That would be incorrect, it produces cars from parts.\n\n \n Indeed! And the parts are \"produced\" by a process that is the same as (in principle) but different from (in detail) the process that ends up producing the car.\n \n \nAll selection, all mutations, all inheritance, and therefore all changes happen on an individual by individual basis.\n\n \n Very well, we are on the same page after all! Whodathunkit?\n \n \nThe genes of a species are moved by the sum of these occurrences.\n \n The reason the species genes are important is because subsequent generations inherit the sum of all previous mutation, selection cycles.\n\n \n Indeed!\n \n \nThis is why guided genetic change is undefined in an individual or for single mutations, the subsequent prevalence is the alteration of the template that allows for the accumulation of selected change as opposed to mere change.\n\n \n And now we're just back to square one. \"Guided genetic change\" appears no different than the outcome of selection itself. Mere semantics.\n \n \n \nSo even though you can find to exception to the rule implied by my assertion you still object to the assertion?\n \n Abstractly logical but hardly convincing.\n\n \n What \"rule implied by your assertion?!?\"\n \n You said: \"Random mutation without natural selection is random inheritance.\" I took this as a statement of identity. Start with \"random mutation with natural selection.\" Take away \"natural selection.\" What have you got left? \"Random mutation,\" i.e., \"random inheritance.\" Insofar as mutation and inheritance are not the same thing, the sentence made no sense to me. Still doesn't.\n \n I certainly don't see a rule.\n \n \nIf the abstract argument is hard for you to follow perhaps you would be interested in a more specific approach.\n \n I offered a while ago to work with someone to create a evolution simulation program, I believe existing evolutionary algorithms contain assumptions that are unwarranted, such as lack of minimal functionality which is a subroutine to is essence evaluate future but as of yet non-existent benefit.\n \n That offer still stands, I like OO coding JS, C++, C#, PHP that sort of stuff. We would probably want to do web tech so that the code is public and one wouldn't have to deal with executables and file transfers.\n\n \n Well, I'm not a programmer at all, so I will decline.\n \n I still find your idea of \"guided genetic change,\" and its associated criticism of evolution, oscillating between mere semantics and unjustifiable metaphysics.",

   "Evolution is not defined as genetic change over time. It's defined as the change in frequency of a gene allele over time within a population. The difference is important. Natural selection does not cause genetic change, but it is a mechanism of evolution nonetheless. You overlook this because you're working with an incomplete definition of what evolution is. \n \n \n Use the real official definition of evolution, not the strawman onesyou keep insisting on that continue to show us how lost you are on the subject.\n\n You say there is a difference could you give an example illustrating the difference?\n \n (hint you will have to find a genetic change that is not contained within the definition of allele)\n \n Indeed you may wish to take this up with bennedict as well for he believed this was an apt definition and said so in post 495 in this thread.\n \n and shortly afterward pandion said the same in post 497\n \n \n \nWhy not?\n\n The contents are either off topic or have been addressed already.\n \n \nFor pity's sake. If you can find any instance in which something this preposterous has actually been said, other than in a straw man, I'll be truly impressed.\n\n You'll have to be more specific.\n \n \nIf all that \"random\" means is \"cannot be predicted in advance,\" then I have absolutely no problem with that. It merely implies that whether or not a given system would come to be, and if so, in what form it would come to be, could not be predicted in advance. Since I believe that these are exactly the case, no problem for me.\n\n It means whether or not any systems would come to be cannot be predicted, if it is fine with you it is fine with me, just don't claim there is a theory that explains what it can't predict.\n \n \nAnd I think that is an absolutely preposterous representation of the co-option argument. Every time I have set out how the process works, I have said that it includes both mutations and selection events. How you can say that \"mutation plus natural selection\" is \"no different\" from \"mutation alone\" beggars the imagination.\n\n The expand your imagination, I can say is no different because selection which has nothing to do with the system is random with respect towards that system.\n \n It is meaningless.\n \n Take dog breeding for example, if we artificially select for dogs with short tails that is selection, but it is random with respect to fitness in a natural environment; i.e. if short tails did help a dog survive in the wild it would be a coincidence not a part of a process.\n \n By saying irrelevant selection is part of the process you are inserting a 'miracle here' clause, it does not follow that selection which has nothing to do with the final system should have anything to do with the final system.\n \n You are content with saying it could have something to do with the final system.\n \n If natural selection was as this in all cases it would be meaningless in all cases, another random factor along with the host of random factors that cumulate in random mutation.\n \n \nWhen trying to explain how co-option could work in principle, I have never made any claim to present any example as more than hypothetical. What would move any claim about a particular concrete case of co-option beyond mere hypothesis is empirical evidence.\n\n You can't have empirical evidence of co-option occurring because the only evidence for co-option after the fact would be homology.\n \n i.e. you nor anyone else can tell what came from what, you must necessarily choose which one you think is simpler and say that is the mother structure(s), and scientist do; and they do contradict each other on what came from what because if every novel system is co-option then all novel systems came from each other, which is obviously circular reasoning.\n \n The fact that parts of the flagellum aren't totally useless if slightly modified and put into another system is no more empirical evidence for co-option than the existance of life is empirical evidence for evolution.\n \n Any one's inability to produce an alternate explanation does not prove the current one.\n \n \nBefore selection?\n\n before the selection of the final system (sequence B) yes. i.e. explaining it's production via selection accumulating mutations in the direction of B.\n \n \nI mean, look. If we're talking about patterns that exist after selection has occurred, then we're back where I mentioned before: \"guided genetic change\" is just \"natural selection\" renamed (to suit what purpose, I have no clue).\n\n The purpose is to explicitly state the process by which structures can be produced.\n \n I have heard of no other way nor has one been implied to me (besides ID).\n \n A genetic change over time is a genetic change over time; what causes the genes to change to create coherent improvements, the only answer is guided genetic change.\n \n Guided genetic change is not identical to natural selection, it is the identification of the only directional pattern that can be produced by natural selection and random mutation.\n \n When most of the world's population say 'this feature evolved', they mean 'this feature was produced via guided genetic change over time' or they aren't saying anything towards the process by which the feature appeared.\n \n \nThis, it seems to me, is where \"guided genetic change\" takes us: either mere semantics, or an unsubstantiated hypothesis.\n\n You are the one disputing the meaning of words that I find obvious, if by claiming 'mere semantics' you are saying that I am trying to argue about the meaning of words to avoid the actual issue I accuse you of that very action.\n \n \nSo what? All this means is, the system was not predictable in advance. And this doesn't imply that the existence of systems now or in the past are void of explanation.\n\n The unpredictable is the unexplainable.\n \n You will find exceptions to that statement only be incorrectly identifying what is being predicted and what is being explained.\n \n The definition of explain which bests suits this context is 'to make clear the cause or reason of; account for: I cannot explain his strange behavior.';\n \n To find a cause is necessarily to setup an IF THEN proposition where the cause is the predicate and the consequent is what is being explained, which is to necessarily predict the consequent if the predicate happens. \n \n You do not mean 'I don't care that the existance of systems can't be predicted in advance' you mean 'I don't care that a particular system can't be predicted'; That is irrelevant.\n \n \nBut what if I'm selecting for some feature of a window -- say, width of opening, to allow air through -- and I now find that what I've got works better as a portal for entry and exit?\n\n Then you have got co-option.\n \n \nThis is why we keep making the argument about co-option, Freedom. You act as though the only way to end with a functional door is to start with selection for a door. And that is simply false.\n\n I act as if the only way to have a process which creates a functional door is to start with selection for a door, and that is simply true.\n \n If you don't want a process, if you find that incremental selected steps are not necessary only luck admit it; instead realizing the absurdity of the consequences of such an admission you try to graft the virtues of the former onto the latter by relying on incremental steps which are unselected with respect towards the door, but you find it to be more acceptable that they were selected for something.\n \n You have practically admitted there is no reason for the selection of precursor systems to have any bearing on the production of the novel system but you stubbornly stand by the idea that those selections should then have a role in explaining the novel system.\n \n \nYes. But so what? Selection in favor of one function can, but need not confer another function, too. As usual, I fail to see why this presents any problem at all, as a matter of principle.\n\n It doesn't present a problem it fails to meet a criteria.\n \n The reason selection changes the game is because the inherited change is not random.\n \n If it can be demonstrated that (and already have) that selection is random with respect to any given novel system then the inherited change is necessarily random with respect towards that system.\n \n This irrelevant selection fails to 'change the game'.\n \n \nFor any concrete case of co-option, there needs to be evidence, not just a statement of possibility. That point I happily concede, now as from the very beginning.\n\n As I said before such evidence will not exist, what if I said the concrete evidence that the flagellum was a single mutation is that it exists?\n \n \nI object to the characterization of the system as \"totally random,\" and of the assembly process as something that happens \"randomly\" alone. Because the system was already the product of mutation plus natural selection, and the assembly process itself consists of further mutation plus natural selection. Since only one half of \"mutation plus natural selection\" is random, I regard your statement as hyperbole.\n\n It is not and cannot be the product of a series of selected steps except by chance, i.e. it is totally random. \n \n \nIt seems to me that you want the actual course of evolution to be necessary. Hence my characterization of you as a metaphysician.\n\n I demand that a scientific theory explains a phenomenon which is to say I demand a cause.\n \n If that makes me a meta-physician so be it.\n \n \nI do not believe that evolution can be used to say what \"will\" happen. Its principles are quite \"good enough\" to say what can happen...\n\n The principle of random mutation alone are 'good enough' to say that, if you find a pyramid on another planet made out of metal alloys with repeated patterns of a finite number of inscription, remember particle physics says 'it could have flown together from random particle vectors'. \n \n \n...and what happens or happened requires an appeal not to odds, but to evidence.\n\n The pyramid exists just as surely as life does.\n \n Does not the metal have extensive homology with other molecules?\n \n Is not the patterns on sand dunes like the lines of the symbols?\n \n And see how mountains are shaped like triangles as the pyramid is!\n \n How then can we deny that it formed from the dust over the centuries?\n \n \nAnd DID is induction. Evolution, like all natural sciences, relies on empirical evidence. How it happened is not a matter of deduction.\n \n I make no apologies for discussing what \"could\" or \"can\" happen, as a matter of principle. To repeat: I have never said that such discussions of principles are adequate as explanations of particular phenomena. The fact that the flagellum \"could have\" evolved through such and such sequence of events -- both mutations and selections -- does not establish that it did. For that, we need evidence. Good old fashioned, empirical evidence.\n\n The evidence which is presented for evolution is never been empirical in my opinion and if it was it would still leave is with a mystery as to why it happened repeatedly because it was not the result of a process.\n \n \nThat's right. Simply saying how likely it is that something could happen is not sufficient to prove that it happened that way.\n\n Nor is asserting it happened that way because we find no contradictory evidence.\n \n \nFor what? You lost me here.\n\n The IC argument concludes that no novel system is the product of a non-random process.\n \n Leaving only appeals to odds to explain their existance.\n \n \n \nFor a species, those wrought by natural selection, to be sure.\n\n Really, how does that work? Does natural selection cause a change or does it spread it?\n \n \n\"Natural selection cannot produce a mutation in an individual. It can, however, produce a mutation's eventual prevalence in the species to which that individual belongs.\"\n \n Individual, species. Stop equivocating.\n\n It's eventual prevalence is not a mutation.\n \n \nSame problem. Existence in an individual, prevalence across the species (which really just means existence in the species). Mutation, natural selection. Sub-features of \"evolution.\"\n\n What was the problem again?\n \n \nAnd I say this is semantics. It explains how a feature \"comes to exist\" as a feature of the species. Per your own definition of \"produce,\" it is perfectly reasonable to use the term to describe this.\n\n Given that it already exists in an individual.\n \n \nIndeed! And the parts are \"produced\" by a process that is the same as (in principle) but different from (in detail) the process that ends up producing the car.\n\n and if we were to say that the auto-factory would be sent random parts, parts that would sit around until they started to do something; how would that in principle be different from saying that random raw materials were sent to sit around until they started to do something?\n \n \nAnd now we're just back to square one. \"Guided genetic change\" appears no different than the outcome of selection itself.\n\n and you realize that every novel system fails to pass the test?\n \n \nWhat \"rule implied by your assertion?!?\"\n \n You said: \"Random mutation without natural selection is random inheritance.\" I took this as a statement of identity. Start with \"random mutation with natural selection.\" Take away \"natural selection.\" What have you got left? \"Random mutation,\" i.e., \"random inheritance.\" Insofar as mutation and inheritance are not the same thing, the sentence made no sense to me. Still doesn't.\n\n Come on you know that is was short hand for 'must result in'.\n \n \nWell, I'm not a programmer at all, so I will decline.\n\n I'll write it, I would want you to approve the algorithm. (logic), you did say you were good at logic right?\n \n \nI still find your idea of \"guided genetic change,\" and its associated criticism of evolution, oscillating between mere semantics and unjustifiable metaphysics.\n\n I still find your defense of evolution to be oscillating between mere semantics and evasionary quibbling.",

   "The contents are either off topic or have been addressed already.\n\n \n The contents are not at all off topic. You're the one claiming that ID is an alternative to evolution. The only versions of ID with which I am familiar invoke a supernatural creator. Sure, they say things like \"Coulda been aliens!\" But when they're being honest, proponents of ID acknowledge that the designer is a supernatural creator.\n \n So I'm just curious who you conceive is guiding your \"guided genetic change.\" Not an unreasonable request, I think.\n \n \nIt means whether or not any systems would come to be cannot be predicted, if it is fine with you it is fine with me, just don't claim there is a theory that explains what it can't predict.\n\n \n Not true. Just because where process will go in the future can't be predicted, doesn't mean that where it has gone in the past is unexplainable. And such unpredictability doesn't call the principles used for the explanation into question.\n \n A wildfire's direction and size in the future can't be predicted in advance. This doesn't mean that the direction it has taken or the size it has reached are inexplicable, and it doesn't call the principles of physics, chemistry, and meteorology into question.\n \n \nThe expand your imagination, I can say is no different because selection which has nothing to do with the system is random with respect towards that system.\n \n It is meaningless.\n\n \n Again, not so. If what you're trying to do is predict where things are going in the future, it can't be done. But if what you're trying to do is explain how things got to where they are -- not a prediction about the future, but an explanation of how the present condition came to be, on the basis of various past events -- then your point is irrelevant.\n \n You want evolution to predict the future. I have a more modest desire, that it merely explain the present on the basis of the past. There's no reason to expect evolution's principles to work any differently in the future, of course. But how it does will depend on what particular mutations occur, and that can't be predicted.\n \n \nBy saying irrelevant selection is part of the process you are inserting a 'miracle here' clause...\n\n \n Not so. The selection that went on was always relevant at the time. But it didn't look into the future.\n \n A system that exists in, say, the Devonian is selected in ways that are indeed completely irrelevant to selection that might later occur in, say, the Cretaceous. This does not in any way mean that the outcome of the earlier selection process is irrelevant to explaining how the later system came about.\n \n It is beyond ironic that a proponent of ID would accuse a proponent of evolution of reliance on miracles. Nothing is more miraculous than the intervention of a designer.\n \n \n...it does not follow that selection which has nothing to do with the final system should have anything to do with the final system.\n\n \n Sorry, but again, this just seems like metaphysical fiat. Sometimes, events have unpredictable consequences. What \"does not follow\" from this is that just because those consequences weren't predictable, the prior events didn't play a role in shaping them.\n \n \nYou are content with saying it could have something to do with the final system.\n\n \n If I'm speaking generally and hypothetically, about principles, then yes, I am content to say that. But if I were speaking about the facts, about what did happen in a particular and concrete case, then I would be far from content with leaving things at the level of what could happen.\n \n \nIf natural selection was as this in all cases it would be meaningless in all cases, another random factor along with the host of random factors that cumulate in random mutation.\n\n \n Not so. The selection that occurred in (to repeat the example) the Devonian was hardly random. It simply became irrelevant with the lapse of millions upon millions of years by the Cretaceous. Nonetheless, its effects might well still be around, even at that later date.\n \n \nYou can't have empirical evidence of co-option occurring because the only evidence for co-option after the fact would be homology.\n\n \n So homology isn't empirical?\n \n And why is this the only evidence possible?\n \n \ni.e. you nor anyone else can tell what came from what, you must necessarily choose which one you think is simpler and say that is the mother structure(s), and scientist do; and they do contradict each other on what came from what because if every novel system is co-option then all novel systems came from each other, which is obviously circular reasoning.\n\n \n Oh, \"must\" we? \"necessarily?\" Spoken like a metaphysician trying to impose rules on how people have to reason.\n \n The choices aren't arbitrary. This doesn't mean that everyone will agree, but it's nowhere near as hopeless as you make it out to be.\n \n \nThe fact that parts of the flagellum aren't totally useless if slightly modified and put into another system is no more empirical evidence for co-option than the existance of life is empirical evidence for evolution.\n\n \n Indeed not. Is that all that the scientific literature says about it? Not being a scientist, I couldn't say for sure.\n \n But since you're keen on predicting the future, I'll offer one: I think you're about to experience the sort of moment Behe did on the stand. After he said nobody was finding evidence about how something as complex as blood clotting evolved, reams of papers were piled up around him containing not just claims about how it could have happened, but evidence for how it did.\n \n \nThe purpose is to explicitly state the process by which structures can be produced.\n \n I have heard of no other way nor has one been implied to me (besides ID).\n\n \n So to repeat, who's your designer?\n \n \nA genetic change over time is a genetic change over time; what causes the genes to change to create coherent improvements, the only answer is guided genetic change.\n \n Guided genetic change is not identical to natural selection, it is the identification of the only directional pattern that can be produced by natural selection and random mutation.\n\n \n And my point is, to say that this is the \"only\" pattern is a vastly overstrong point. What we can say is that such-and-such is the path that random mutation and natural selection did take, not that no other path was even possible.\n \n You seem to want a teleological metaphysic built right into the evolutionary process, and the above is a perfect example. You can have any metaphysic you want, of course. Just don't pretend that it's science.\n \n \nWhen most of the world's population say 'this feature evolved', they mean 'this feature was produced via guided genetic change over time' or they aren't saying anything towards the process by which the feature appeared.\n\n \n Since when does what \"most of the world's population\" says bear any weight in a scientific discussion? \"Average joe,\" \"practically everyone\" -- who cares? Science isn't decided by a plebiscite. Why are you so keen to accomodate the misunderstandings of laymen, instead of correct them?\n \n \nThe unpredictable is the unexplainable.\n\n \n Nope. See above. Just because something can't be predicted before it happens doesn't mean it can't be explained after it has happened.\n \n \nThe definition of explain which bests suits this context is 'to make clear the cause or reason of; account for: I cannot explain his strange behavior.';\n \n To find a cause is necessarily to setup an IF THEN proposition where the cause is the predicate and the consequent is what is being explained, which is to necessarily predict the consequent if the predicate happens.\n\n \n Can the past be explained, on this model?\n \n See, once again, I think your just playing metaphysics here, setting up demands for how everybody use language, so that it will load in your presuppositions. I don't accuse you of dishonesty or cynicism, because I've got no evidence of that. But I do think you're loading up the game.\n \n \nI act as if the only way to have a process which creates a functional door is to start with selection for a door, and that is simply true.\n\n \n Then here is a fundamental difference between us. You are declaring that this is the only way to get a functional door. I don't this declaration is remotely justified. Selection in favor of one part or function can, coincidentally, also improve functionality in another direction, and this other functionality could itself be directly selected later.\n \n I have said \"can\" because all I'm trying to establish is the principle, please note. And it is this very principle that your argument rules out with \"only.\"\n \n \nIf you don't want a process, if you find that incremental selected steps are not necessary only luck admit it\n\n \n Why would I admit such a thing? It's not \"only luck.\" How many times do I have to mention \"mutation plus natural selection?\" All I'm saying is, the selection in question can be directly for A, while also -- completely coincidentally -- improving function for B. This \"coincidence\" means that B didn't have to happen, it is \"lucky.\" But it doesn't leave the explanation for B's occurrence as \"only luck,\" since the other function with which it was linked, namely A, was not \"only luck.\"\n \n Could the eventual evolution of a specialized B structure be predicted at the time? No. Can it be explained, if and when it comes to exist? Yes. There is no problem here, at all.\n \n \ninstead realizing the absurdity of the consequences of such an admission you try to graft the virtues of the former onto the latter by relying on incremental steps which are unselected with respect towards the door, but you find it to be more acceptable that they were selected for something.\n\n \n As far as I'm concerned, it's up to you to show that such a thing is in principle impossible, because that's what you're claiming.\n \n Please note again that I do not take the mere establishment that is in principle possible to be remotely sufficient for concrete explanation in particular concrete cases, so please don't try that straw man. You are saying this isn't even possible, as a matter of principle. I say, all you're doing is arguing by fiat.\n \n \nYou have practically admitted there is no reason for the selection of precursor systems to have any bearing on the production of the novel system but you stubbornly stand by the idea that those selections should then have a role in explaining the novel system.\n\n \n And I stand by it, because it's right. I keep bringing up that structures can fulfill multiple functionalities, because you keep ignoring the consequence of it. Selection for one function can enable another. This other can then later be selected itself. But if we are trying to explain the path by which this other function came about, the earlier unrelated function is related to explaining how various parts of the system came to be.\n \n \nI demand that a scientific theory explains a phenomenon which is to say I demand a cause.\n \n If that makes me a meta-physician so be it.\n\n \n No, you are demanding not just an explanation based on causes, but predictions for where a process whose causes are partly random will go. And that sort of cryptic teleology makes you a metaphysician.\n \n \nThe evidence which is presented for evolution is never been empirical in my opinion...\n\n \n When you say things like this, I think I can be forgiven for confusing you with a run-of-the-mill creationist.\n \n \nNor is asserting it happened that way because we find no contradictory evidence.\n\n \n Again, show me any scientific paper in which it is claimed that \"feature x came about this way, because there's no evidence it came about some other way.\"\n \n \nThe IC argument concludes that no novel system is the product of a non-random process.\n \n Leaving only appeals to odds to explain their existance.\n\n \n So IC concludes that novel systems are the products of random processes? (Removing the double negative.) Then it's even more ridiculous than I ever realized.\n \n \nand if we were to say that the auto-factory would be sent random parts, parts that would sit around until they started to do something; how would that in principle be different from saying that random raw materials were sent to sit around until they started to do something?\n\n \n Tornado in a junkyard, again? Sorry, but you strike me as nothing more than a creationist when you say such things.\n \n \nCome on you know that is was short hand for 'must result in'.\n\n \n Really? I know that \"is\" means \"must result in?\" Show me the process by which the former entails the latter.\n \n One of us was being sloppy. Wasn't me.\n \n \nI'll write it, I would want you to approve the algorithm. (logic), you did say you were good at logic right?\n\n \n I am, but on the basis of the above, I can honestly say that I'm not interested.\n \n \nI still find your defense of evolution to be oscillating between mere semantics and evasionary quibbling.\n\n \n When have I ever been evasive?",

   "Again you're missing the key term in the definition: frequency. Evolution is the process by which gene frequencies change within an entire population within a particular area or shared environment. I don't have to demonstrate the difference between genetic change and allele change because that's not what you're missing in your definition. \n \n The mechanism that may affect the frequency of a particular allele, and by extension the organism trait that the allele dictates, is natural selection. Genetic mutation grants that the trait exists to begin with, but natural selection governs whether such trait will increase, decrease, or neither, and by what degree. Thus evolution (which is not defined as genetic change over time, but change in the frequency of a particular genetic trait over time), cannot be defined without the mechanism of natural selection included in it. Hope that helps.\n \n Genetic drift is then not evolution? \n \n \nSo I'm just curious who you conceive is guiding your \"guided genetic change.\" Not an unreasonable request, I think.\n \n natural selection. \n \n \nNot true. Just because where process will go in the future can't be predicted, doesn't mean that where it has gone in the past is unexplainable. And such unpredictability doesn't call the principles used for the explanation into question.\n \n I did not say unexplainable, I say unexplained. \n \n and the failure to predict the future can be caused by a lack of data, in this case however it is a lack of sound theory. \n \n \nA wildfire's direction and size in the future can't be predicted in advance.\n \n Then you can't know why wildfire's move or change size. \n \n \nThis doesn't mean that the direction it has taken or the size it has reached are inexplicable, and it doesn't call the principles of physics, chemistry, and meteorology into question.\n \n You think I do not see this strawman? \n \n I have seen it three times on this forum, it is without base I have never claimed that you must know which systems evolution produces, just that it produces them. \n \n This analogy has the same error that the particle interaction has, we do know what size and direction a wildfire will take; ask a firefighter. \n \n You would rely on the fact that we can't practically predict the strength and direction of the wind nor the amount of fuel on that path to mean we cannot predict the fire. \n \n To say that we absolutely can't predict is to say that you have no idea what causes the phenomenon. \n \n \nAgain, not so. If what you're trying to do is predict where things are going in the future, it can't be done.\n \n It can be done, but I am not trying to do so for the pathways of evolution. \n \n \nBut if what you're trying to do is explain how things got to where they are -- not a prediction about the future, but an explanation of how the present condition came to be, on the basis of various past events -- then your point is irrelevant.\n \n You are right there is an assumption that things that happened in the past follow the same deterministic laws as the present. \n \n \nYou want evolution to predict the future. I have a more modest desire, that it merely explain the present on the basis of the past. There's no reason to expect evolution's principles to work any differently in the future, of course. But how it does will depend on what particular mutations occur, and that can't be predicted.\n \n and in the future there will be no guided selection towards novel systems, they will randomly appear for no good reason by the verdict of irrational evolution. \n \n \nNot so. The selection that went on was always relevant at the time. But it didn't look into the future.\n \n If there is no pattern connecting the future to the present selection there is no pattern connecting production with selection. \n \n \nA system that exists in, say, the Devonian is selected in ways that are indeed completely irrelevant to selection that might later occur in, say, the Cretaceous. This does not in any way mean that the outcome of the earlier selection process is irrelevant to explaining how the later system came about.\n \n Yes it does, if the selection was completely irrelevant to the system it is completely irrelevant to the explanation. \n \n You cannot explain a falling book by saying that stars shine, the fact that stars shine for their own reason and cause does not confer it's explanation through the irrelevant to something completely different. \n \n \nIt is beyond ironic that a proponent of ID would accuse a proponent of evolution of reliance on miracles. Nothing is more miraculous than the intervention of a designer.\n \n Then I am a miracle worker. \n \n \nSorry, but again, this just seems like metaphysical fiat. Sometimes, events have unpredictable consequences. What \"does not follow\" from this is that just because those consequences weren't predictable, the prior events didn't play a role in shaping them.\n \n Knowledge of the events that shaped the consequences necessitates the predictability of those consequences save if you do not have a theory which states the events shape the consequences. \n \n \nNot so. The selection that occurred in (to repeat the example) the Devonian was hardly random. It simply became irrelevant with the lapse of millions upon millions of years by the Cretaceous. Nonetheless, its effects might well still be around, even at that later date.\n \n The effect might still be around, but it would be a random effect if it was irrelevant excepting any reason to expect otherwise. \n \n \nSo homology isn't empirical?\n \n Insofar as it does not prove co-option or evolution no it isn't. \n \n \nAnd why is this the only evidence possible?\n \n Direct evidence is unavailable, comparative evidence is the only standard; and since the only comparative prediction made by evolution is common descent the only evidence is homology. \n \n Even more so with co-option where coincidental relationships are asserted, yet the only standard of occurrence is if one system is similar to another. \n \n Let me clarify something when I say 'does not prove co-option' I mean does not prove that any given example was non-random. \n \n The existence of a mutation does not prove that mutations aren't random. \n \n \nOh, \"must\" we? \"necessarily?\" Spoken like a metaphysician trying to impose rules on how people have to reason. \n \n The choices aren't arbitrary. This doesn't mean that everyone will agree, but it's nowhere near as hopeless as you make it out to be.\n \n Oh it is.... try to draw a chart with points where the only rule is that each dot must come from or to another dot, if you don't have a circuit publish your findings. \n \n \nIndeed not. Is that all that the scientific literature says about it? Not being a scientist, I couldn't say for sure.\n \n That's the assertion of co-option, I guarantee that is all that can be said about it. \n \n This is a splendid opportunity to show my ignorance. \n \n \nBut since you're keen on predicting the future, I'll offer one: I think you're about to experience the sort of moment Behe did on the stand. After he said nobody was finding evidence about how something as complex as blood clotting evolved, reams of papers were piled up around him containing not just claims about how it could have happened, but evidence for how it did.\n \n You can't find evidence for the impossible. \n \n \nSo to repeat, who's your designer?\n \n Zeus, the THUNDER GOD. \n \n \nAnd my point is, to say that this is the \"only\" pattern is a vastly overstrong point. What we can say is that such-and-such is the path that random mutation and natural selection did take, not that no other path was even possible.\n \n I can say that no other path was even possible if I define a path as anything more coherent or scientifically honest that a series of random events which followed each other for no other reason than it would be convenient to think they did. \n \n \nYou seem to want a teleological metaphysic built right into the evolutionary process, and the above is a perfect example. You can have any metaphysic you want, of course. Just don't pretend that it's science.\n \n Don't pretend science is about claiming that things which happen for no known reason are explained. \n \n \nSince when does what \"most of the world's population\" says bear any weight in a scientific discussion? \"Average joe,\" \"practically everyone\" -- who cares? Science isn't decided by a plebiscite. Why are you so keen to accomodate the misunderstandings of laymen, instead of correct them?\n \n I would be happy too, but you share in their misunderstandings. \n \n A change in allele frequencies does not explain the advancement of life, it doesn't even follow. \n \n But you said evolution explained the advancement of life. \n \n \nNope. See above. Just because something can't be predicted before it happens doesn't mean it can't be explained after it has happened.\n \n Nope see below. \n \n \nCan the past be explained, on this model?\n \n On the model that an explanation is a cause? Yes. \n \n \nSee, once again, I think your just playing metaphysics here, setting up demands for how everybody use language, so that it will load in your presuppositions. I don't accuse you of dishonesty or cynicism, because I've got no evidence of that. But I do think you're loading up the game.\n \n I am certainly not going to censor my logic for propositions which you find improper for no other reason than they are metaphysical. \n \n and I say 'which you find' because I have no idea where you are coming from. \n \n If then statements are part of the ultimate nature of reality, but so is eating a jelly sandwich, I don't see how you escape the metaphysical semantics since you live in reality and use words to communicate. \n \n \nThen here is a fundamental difference between us. You are declaring that this is the only way to get a functional door.\n \n No I declare this is the only way for natural selection to produce a functional door. \n \n A door could appear by luck out of rotting wood, or it could be designed by a carpenter. \n \n \nI don't this declaration is remotely justified. Selection in favor of one part or function can, coincidentally, also improve functionality in another direction, and this other functionality could itself be directly selected later.\n \n and there is nothing wrong with coincidences, they are just not a process. \n \n The reason natural selection means something is because it renders the mutation inheritance cycle non-random, allows it to be a process. \n \n If you replace relevant selection with coincidence, this effect is nullified. \n \n \nI have said \"can\" because all I'm trying to establish is the principle, please note. And it is this very principle that your argument rules out with \"only.\"\n \n the only has always meant 'only explainable'. \n \n \nWhy would I admit such a thing? It's not \"only luck.\" How many times do I have to mention \"mutation plus natural selection?\" All I'm saying is, the selection in question can be directly for A, while also -- completely coincidentally -- improving function for B. This \"coincidence\" means that B didn't have to happen, it is \"lucky.\" But it doesn't leave the explanation for B's occurrence as \"only luck,\" since the other function with which it was linked, namely A, was not \"only luck.\"\n \n You will eventually admit it or quit because I am not being confused by the transfusion of selective implications you take for granted in co-option. \n \n \nCould the eventual evolution of a specialized B structure be predicted at the time? No. Can it be explained, if and when it comes to exist? Yes. There is no problem here, at all.\n \n Could the eventual change in allele frequencies of a specialized B structure be predicted at the time? \n \n That sentence is ill formed, it seems you are using evolution as a verb here, particularity a subset of the verb 'production'. \n \n Shall I correct the average joe? \n \n I have already addressed the error of explanation without prediction. \n \n \nAs far as I'm concerned, it's up to you to show that such a thing is in principle impossible, because that's what you're claiming.\n \n I claim nothing is impossible except that the process of natural selection and random mutation formed a novel system. \n \n A novel system could still appear out of the blue, just not as a result of a series of relevant selection events. \n \n \nNo, you are demanding not just an explanation based on causes, but predictions for where a process whose causes are partly random will go. And that sort of cryptic teleology makes you a metaphysician.\n \n Strawman\n \n \nWhen you say things like this, I think I can be forgiven for confusing you with a run-of-the-mill creationist.\n \n I can't help it if a creationist says something true every once in a while. \n \n \nAgain, show me any scientific paper in which it is claimed that \"feature x came about this way, because there's no evidence it came about some other way.\"\n \n That is the connection asserted between homology and evolution. \n \n \nSo IC concludes that novel systems are the products of random processes? (Removing the double negative.) Then it's even more ridiculous than I ever realized.\n \n I should have said the non-random process of guided genetic change. \n \n Even so, yes it concludes that if no other explanation is given, the only one is random processes; which we both agree is improper. \n \n So I then conclude that we do not know what produces novel systems. \n \n \n Tornado in a junkyard, again? Sorry, but you strike me as nothing more than a creationist when you say such things.\n \n If you don't want to answer don't feel obligated include waste. \n \n \nI am, but on the basis of the above, I can honestly say that I'm not interested.\n \n I wouldn't be interested in being proven wrong either. \n \n \nWhen have I ever been evasive?\n \n By assuming every word with a definition is semantics and every proposition with an abstract is metaphysics you have effectively produced what you claim to be the problem with my argumentation. \n \n \nfrom the \"smoking gun\" thread, just to keep things clean. \n \n so youre saying co-option is possible then?\n \n Yes, and yes, and yes yes (for the next three times you forget what I have said). \n \n \nif i get your argument, co-option is possible but improbable because its a random selection of function. you would rather go for the more probable popped-into-existence-and-then-was-selected-for argument.\n \n I can't make any statements about the absolute probability of any given co-option, I can say it's generally unlikely along with popping into existence as being generally unlikely based on some inferences. \n \n My argument however is that co-option is not a process like natural selection and random mutation but a chance, just like random mutation alone. \n \n \nso we progress - how is the selection of a co-opted feature random?\n \n It isn't \n \n \nthe mutation of an existing function into a new function is random like all evolved traits, but the selection is not, also like all evolved traits.\n \n The production of all evolved traits is not necessarily random, they can be the sum of selected mutations. \n \n \nif co-option is a random process, wouldnt IC be a random process as well? \n \n Neither are processes. \n \n \nwithout an \"intelligent agent\", wouldnt the production of a perfectly functional, new novel feature be just as random and unlikely as the co-option alternative?\n \n Assuming you mean production via straight mutation, yes at least. \n \n \nin which case, would that lead you to come to the conclusion that there is an intelligent agent operating the principles of IC?\n \n If I had the premise that either irrational evolution or an ID produced life. \n \n \nto be fair, looking at things from a scientific, what-we-know-and-understand point of view, co-option is more likely. without a designer, which we dont know and dont understand, IC is a complete joke. in comparing co-option with IC sans designer, co-option is infinitely more probable, as improbable as you make it seem.\n \n IC is IC, it is not a joke and it does not rely on a designer, nor on the probability of spontaneous, or otherwise random generation of systems.",

Benefit, the precise attribute which is to increase in the theory is the standard by which mutations are filtered; this is rational.\n \n You would impudently deny the idea that mutations alone produced a flagellum but your own arguments could be applied to that denial.\n \n How do you know it's impossible?\n \n You have said it goes against all genetics, the only part about genetics it goes against is a lack of self-organization into functional forms.\n \n Genetics does not state mutations do not happen nor does it state there is any limit to what form they can take especially over several events.\n \n If you had never come up with the co-option argument, I could replace all my responses with 'mutation' and they would still make sense.\n \n Mutation forming the system would still not be impossible, I would still not require it to be so, and you would still be answering 'it just did' to the question 'why would any series of or single mutations form a flagellum'.\n \n \nbasically, the difference in our arguments is i think random mutation changed the function of a system\n\n With no justification on how that is done by a process.\n \n \nwhile youre saying it all came as one big lump of a random mutation.\n\n strawman\n \n \nto me, your argument encompasses far too many random acts to be reasonable.\n\n Same here.\n \n \nthe co-option argument is one random act, plus the stability of natural selection\n\n This is what I meant by you are using co-option to be more appealing.\n \n The odds are not constant and you cannot just multiply by the number of distinct events to arrive at them.\n \n The odds that a sequence is formed in a single mutation and the odds that it is formed as a series of unselected mutations are about equal.\n \n Similarly the more complex the systems involved in co-option are the less likely co-option becomes, despite the fact that is conceptually a single occurrence.\n \n Is it easier for two 400 base pairs systems to match up by chance or 10 base pairs?\n \n The same odds calculation I made on the chance of random mutation producing a sequence can be applied to co-option with one more piece of information, namely the saturation of functional radii in the benefit landscape.\n \n I don't have that map but we have a vague idea from the ratio of beneficial-neutral-detrimental mutations.\n \n \njust the same way all evolutionary modifications work. why isnt that more plausible?\n\n No it is not the same as all evolutionary modifications.\n \n It is the same as the random output which is then filtered.\n \n If several co-option events were coherently selected to created a system, that would be guided genetic change.\n \n That is not the way co-option is used, it takes the place of selection, in your stories as the magic association and it cannot be otherwise because none of the proposed co-options could be selected for a non-existent system just as no series of mutations could either.\n \n Systems can be modified and improved in coherent fashion by a series of selection events.\n \n A single selection event may only explain how a system became the standard, not how it was produced.",

   "I had asked what does the guiding for \"guided genetic change.\" You replied:\n \n \nnatural selection.\n\n \n But this won't do, for a couple reasons.\n \n First, in post #520, I had asked for clarification of whether guided genetic change does its work before or after selection. You answered in the next post, \"before,\" so it seems a bit odd to say that natural selection is the designer prior to its own action. Could you clarify what you mean?\n \n Second, if natural selection is what guides guided genetic change, then why is this anything other than a mere redescription of the phenomena in question? I can't think of any evolutionists who would deny that natural selection has a major impact on genomes, just it does so after the fact of the changes going on in any particular individuals. This idea -- that all you're doing is redescribing -- is the main reason for my \"semantics\" charge.\n \n \nI did not say unexplainable, I say unexplained.\n\n \n Not so. In post #521, you said: \"The unpredictable is the unexplainable.\" Your words.\n \n \nand the failure to predict the future can be caused by a lack of data, in this case however it is a lack of sound theory.\n\n \n Disagreed. I don't see any problem with the theory. Just in our practical capacities to determine when individual mutations will occur, or what their consequences will be.\n \n \nThis analogy has the same error that the particle interaction has, we do know what size and direction a wildfire will take; ask a firefighter.\n\n \n Still, firefighters carry fire protection cocoons, and even those don't prevent all the tragedies. Why?\n \n \nYou would rely on the fact that we can't practically predict the strength and direction of the wind nor the amount of fuel on that path to mean we cannot predict the fire.\n\n \n Exactly right!\n \n \nTo say that we absolutely can't predict is to say that you have no idea what causes the phenomenon.\n\n \n But if what you want to contrast is practical and \"absolute\" unpredictability, then I would say our knowledge of what causes mutations isn't in question! We don't have this \"absolute\" problem, just a forbiddingly difficult practical one.\n \n And again, the causes in question are not the province of evolutionary explanation, but genetics and embryology.\n \n \nand in the future there will be no guided selection towards novel systems, they will randomly appear for no good reason by the verdict of irrational evolution.\n\n \n But this, I think, is indeed the point. Maybe \"random\" is not the right word, in this context. Maybe Jerry Coyne's \"indifferent\" is better. Because mutations happen without any inherent tendency toward benefit for their possessors, or any inherent directionality at all. Such direction as there is comes after the fact, at the level of the population or species, and it comes from natural selection. And the directionality often reverses, as environmental conditions change; see Weiner's The Beak of the Finch for an example.\n \n If you think that mutations are not indifferent, that they do have an intrinsic directionality, then the burden of proof is yours to prove it. It's an empirical matter, and can only be decided by empircal evidence. Right now? I'm afraid there isn't any. It's not impossible. But the evidence isn't there.\n \n \nIf there is no pattern connecting the future to the present selection there is no pattern connecting production with selection.\n\n \n I will happily concede that there is no necessary, logical, or conceptual link between them. There is only a contingent, empirical, factual link.\n \n \nif the selection was completely irrelevant to the system it is completely irrelevant to the explanation.\n\n \n Not so. Let me use an example from artifical selection, in technological rather than living systems.\n \n The QWERTY keyboard is standard for American computers. But why does it have that unusual arrangement of keys?\n \n The answer comes from the computer's precursor, the typewriter. Early typewriters had keys arranged alphabetically. But this enabled typists to use such speed, and with striking arms so close together, that jams were frequent, and difficult to fix! The keyboard was rearranged to space things out, both for the striking arms and for the typists' fingers, so that jams were less likely. And it seems to have worked. Eventually, the QWERTY arrangement became standard for typewriters.\n \n Later electric typewriters had less problems with jamming in and of themselves, but kept the QWERTY arrangement because people had gotten used to it. It would have taken more time to retrain everyone, not to mention the waste of material with old typewriters. So it stuck.\n \n And it still stuck when keyboards were used with computers, which clearly have no problems with jamming. The explanation for why computer keyboards are arranged as they are has absolutely nothing to do with any functionality for a computer keyboard itself. It's explained by reference to a past selection, for a past functionality.\n \n The same sort of thing applies in biology. Past functionality can explain present structure.\n \n \nThe effect might still be around, but it would be a random effect if it was irrelevant excepting any reason to expect otherwise.\n\n \n Random with respect to the ultimate structure? \"Indifferent\" to it, in Coyne's sense? Yes. But -- and this is important -- not random or indifferent in any \"absolute\" sense. And certainly not unexplainable.\n \n \nInsofar as it does not prove co-option or evolution no it isn't.\n\n \n So if it doesn't work, it isn't even empirical? How does that follow?\n \n \nDirect evidence is unavailable, comparative evidence is the only standard; and since the only comparative prediction made by evolution is common descent the only evidence is homology. \n \n Even more so with co-option where coincidental relationships are asserted, yet the only standard of occurrence is if one system is similar to another.\n\n \n Well, what do you think similarities are evidence of, given that such similarities don't have to obtain at all?\n \n \ntry to draw a chart with points where the only rule is that each dot must come from or to another dot, if you don't have a circuit publish your findings.\n\n \n But this is a terrible analogy with trying to arrange fossils in sequence. Unlike dots, the fossils aren't identical, but some resemble each other more closely than others. Moreover, the background isn't uniform, but stratified into datable layers. And there is no rule that there must be one line, without branches.\n \n There are certainly disagreements about how to arrange things. But it's hardly an arbitrary process.\n \n \nThis is a splendid opportunity to show my ignorance.\n\n \n Chapter 5 of Miller's Finding Darwin's God discusses numerous such discussions, which start by saying what could happen and then try to figure out what did on the basis of evidence. Look at the original papers cited there, and then get back to me.\n \n \nI can say that no other path was even possible if I define a path as anything more coherent or scientifically honest that a series of random events which followed each other for no other reason than it would be convenient to think they did.\n\n \n Again, I think this is a total misrepresentation of how evolutionary sequences are reconstructed. It's not a matter of convenience, but where evidence leads.\n \n \nDon't pretend science is about claiming that things which happen for no known reason are explained.\n\n \n Don't pretend evolution says that things happened for no reason.\n \n \nI am certainly not going to censor my logic for propositions which you find improper for no other reason than they are metaphysical. \n \n and I say 'which you find' because I have no idea where you are coming from. \n \n If then statements are part of the ultimate nature of reality, but so is eating a jelly sandwich, I don't see how you escape the metaphysical semantics since you live in reality and use words to communicate.\n\n \n I don't doubt that language carries ontological commitments. What I object to is your use of \"only\" such that evolutions actual path turns out to be a necessary path, rather than a contingent path. Maybe it was! And maybe it wasn't. The empirical evidence is quite compatible with either, and I object to the attempt to build one and \"only\" one metaphysic directly into what the empirical evidence tells us.\n \n \nNo I declare this is the only way for natural selection to produce a functional door.\n\n \n And I have already addressed why it isn't, so I feel no inclination to do so again. This insistent \"declaration\" is groundless, in my view -- indeed, empirical evidence flies directly in its face.\n \n \nA door could appear by luck out of rotting wood, or it could be designed by a carpenter.\n\n \n And to analogize evolution to appearance by luck is just grossly wrong.\n \n \nand there is nothing wrong with coincidences, they are just not a process.\n\n \n And I would say, where evolution is concerned, they're parts of the process.\n \n \nThe reason natural selection means something is because it renders the mutation inheritance cycle non-random, allows it to be a process. \n \n If you replace relevant selection with coincidence, this effect is nullified.\n\n \n But not all selection that leads to a final structure is relevant to it! Some of it is coincidental! SO WHAT?!? This hardly reduces the entire evolutionary path to randomness. It just means that selective pressures have changed over time, yet their effects remain.\n \n \nYou will eventually admit it or quit....\n\n \n I'm leaning toward the latter.\n \n \nBy assuming every word with a definition is semantics...\n\n \n Talk about a straw man! I have never said THAT is the reason for my \"semantics\" charge. My point with that charge -- as exemplified early in this post -- is that your \"guided genetic change\" does not seem appreciably different from \"mutation plus natural selection.\" At best, a mere redescription.\n \n \n...and every proposition with an abstract is metaphysics...\n\n \n Another straw man. My charge is and always has been much more specific. Empirical evidence does not indicate that mutations have intrinsic directionality. Empirical evidence does not indicate that actual evolutionary paths were the only possible paths, i.e., necessary paths. By trying to build such ideas into how evolution works, I think you are engaging in a metaphysical rather than properly scientific project. One that might well be true, but certainly isn't justified by the empirical evidence. (And one that ultimately, I think is false, because it flies in the face of that evidence.)\n \n \n...you have effectively produced what you claim to be the problem with my argumentation.\n\n \n I'm sorry you feel that way. But I believe I've adequately explained above why I think \"guided genetic change\" reduces to a merely semantic point or to a metaphysical one. And I'm going to stand by that until you can either explain how making natural selection the guide of genetic change is anything other than \"mutation/variation plus natural selection,\" or provide empirical evidence that mutations/variations have any intrinsic directionality. Absent such explanation or evidence: semantics at best, metaphysics at worst.",

You answered in the next post, \"before,\" so it seems a bit odd to say that natural selection is the designer prior to its own action. Could you clarify what you mean?\n\n The clarification followed the word 'before', the entire response was: \"before the selection of the final system (sequence B) yes. i.e. explaining it's production via selection accumulating mutations in the direction of B.\"\n \n Once system B exists it has been produced, that does not mean it's selection is irrelevant or won't happen; but it does mean that selection is irrelevant for explaining it's production while it's persistence and prevalence are also necessary to explain... they are by that final selection.\n \n It's production on the other hand is explained (if possible) by a series of accumulated modifications each (well not literally each but each on the path) moving closer to B; that is a series of mutation selection cycles preserving changes that as a whole have converted the system to B.\n \n These selection events come before production and must. (given that the future does not effect the past).\n \n Further the context you gave after you asked the question 'before?'\n \n \"I mean, look. If we're talking about patterns that exist after selection has occurred, then we're back where I mentioned before: \"guided genetic change\" is just \"natural selection\" renamed (to suit what purpose, I have no clue).\n \n But if we're talking about patterns that exist before selection, then the burden of proof lies with you to provide evidence that mutations or inheritance or whatever other genetic process you like is already pushing the genes in that direction. This isn't going to settled \"deductively\" or \"conceptually,\" but empirically. And so far as I know, there is no such empirical evidence for such a thing.\"\n \n was that you were thinking of single events, meaning you were considering only one possible selection 'before or after' the change.\n \n That combined with the context that you had previously tried to make points along the line of 'who bloody cares where the modification comes from all that matters is that it was selected afterward' I thought it prudent to identify that selection events were being referenced, but not the final post production one you have tunnel vision of.\n \n \n \nSecond, if natural selection is what guides guided genetic change, then why is this anything other than a mere redescription of the phenomena in question?\n\n As I said they are not identical, you say it's natural selection because it is directly based on natural selection.\n \n It however deals with series of changes as opposed to a single boolean alternative (yes, no , null).\n \n It is a namespace for identifying what natural selection means to evolutionary production, and it wouldn't be necessary if people would think about it themselves.\n \n Let me illustrate this with an example, a single mutation happens and is selected.\n \n The guided genetic change test returns negative, that means the change was not produced.\n \n Assuredly there was selection and that explains why the mutation became prevalent among all other mutations but the change was not produced it was 'taken advantage of' to use a common phrase.\n \n As previously described natural selection if it were a function takes a mutation and it's benefit as arguments and returns a change in allele frequencies based on where that mutation is located. Guided genetic change takes a genetic change, that is two different sequences and the mutations and the selections on the path between those systems and returns a boolean (yes, no, null) as to whether the genetic change was guided. (produced).\n \n In the case of producing anything it is an A to B change that is being discussed which means guided genetic change test should apply, at the very least because natural selection alone cannot incorporate the idea of multiple events.\n \n Natural selection is to guided genetic change as y = 5 is to f(x) = 3x+2.\n four mutations happen, three of them are selected due to similarity with the final system; the fourth completes the genetic change in question.\n The change was guided, the final selection is excluded because the production of the system has already happened, and practically you don't have to worry about it unless you are intentionally testing a non-beneficial system. \n \n \n \nNot so. In post #521, you said: \"The unpredictable is the unexplainable.\" Your words.\n\n I don't believe the unexplainable or the unpredictable exist absolutley. If I remember correctly when I said that you were in the process of using a lack of data to make future predictions impractical while past events were explained to contradict the identity above.\n \n In which case you were talking about the unpredicted, not the unpredictable.\n The unpredictable is the unexplainable, but the unpredicted is not the unexplained.\n \n but hey, in the strictest sense you got me, I did say unexplainable... I bet I also said unexplained somewhere; just do a text search :p\n \n \n \nDisagreed. I don't see any problem with the theory. Just in our practical capacities to determine when individual mutations will occur, or what their consequences will be.\n\n The theory of 'a change in allele frequencies over time'?\n \n \nStill, firefighters carry fire protection cocoons, and even those don't prevent all the tragedies. Why?\n\n because they cannot always predict which direction or what size a wildfire will take. A lack of data not theory.\n \n The mere fact that the size and direction of any fire has been predicted means that it is not unpredictable.\n \n Further it is obvious that it is predictable given that we know what causes changes in direction and size.\n \n Just like the rest of real scientific knowledge, knowledge of the cause necessitates ability to predict the phenomenon if present causes are accounted for.\n \n The inverse also being true, the only way for something to be absolutely unpredictable is for either the causes to be completly and absolutely unknown or for there to be no theory relating the causes to the effect.\n \n Databed I think made a point about this temporal business a while back, I think he observed that it is incorrect to force prediction to be in the future. i.e. the prediction of common descent certainly can't be verified by waiting around for it, that doesn't mean we can't look at past evidence to verify it.\n The concept of an experiment also necessitates prediction of phenomenon.\n \n \n \nExactly right!\n\n I am sorry, I should have said 'to mean we cannot predict a fire'.\n \n \nBut if what you want to contrast is practical and \"absolute\" unpredictability, then I would say our knowledge of what causes mutations isn't in question! We don't have this \"absolute\" problem, just a forbiddingly difficult practical one.\n\n So you are saying you have a theory relating mutation to benefit?\n \n \nAnd again, the causes in question are not the province of evolutionary explanation, but genetics and embryology.\n\n Then by all means explain to me the production of novel systems via genetics and embryology.\n \n \nBut this, I think, is indeed the point. Maybe \"random\" is not the right word, in this context. Maybe Jerry Coyne's \"indifferent\" is better. Because mutations happen without any inherent tendency toward benefit for their possessors, or any inherent directionality at all. Such direction as there is comes after the fact, at the level of the population or species, and it comes from natural selection. And the directionality often reverses, as environmental conditions change; see Weiner's The Beak of the Finch for an example.\n\n Just as a dice will land on a number 'indifferent' to the needs of the board game player. Yet amongst the possible sides it could land on it is random.\n \n \nIf you think that mutations are not indifferent, that they do have an intrinsic directionality, then the burden of proof is yours to prove it. It's an empirical matter, and can only be decided by empircal evidence. Right now? I'm afraid there isn't any. It's not impossible. But the evidence isn't there.\n\n There is no inherent directionality\n \n \nI will happily concede that there is no necessary, logical, or conceptual link between them. There is only a contingent, empirical, factual link.\n\n It sounds as if you are treating your knowledge on the advancement of life as an observation as opposed to a theory.\n \n \nNot so. Let me use an example from artifical selection, in technological rather than living systems.\n \n The QWERTY keyboard is standard for American computers. But why does it have that unusual arrangement of keys?\n \n The answer comes from the computer's precursor, the typewriter. Early typewriters had keys arranged alphabetically. But this enabled typists to use such speed, and with striking arms so close together, that jams were frequent, and difficult to fix! The keyboard was rearranged to space things out, both for the striking arms and for the typists' fingers, so that jams were less likely. And it seems to have worked. Eventually, the QWERTY arrangement became standard for typewriters.\n \n Later electric typewriters had less problems with jamming in and of themselves, but kept the QWERTY arrangement because people had gotten used to it. It would have taken more time to retrain everyone, not to mention the waste of material with old typewriters. So it stuck.\n \n And it still stuck when keyboards were used with computers, which clearly have no problems with jamming. The explanation for why computer keyboards are arranged as they are has absolutely nothing to do with any functionality for a computer keyboard itself. It's explained by reference to a past selection, for a past functionality.\n \n The same sort of thing applies in biology. Past functionality can explain present structure.\n\n Excellent analogy.\n So if we were to translate that back into biology we are saying that if we see vestigial elements in a system, those can be explained by those elements being necessary for the precursor system.\n \n Do you notice something? The selection was not irrelevant to the system.\n The system was a typewriter, the selection was for a type writer. The system had been produced and gone out of use long before a computer keyboard inherited those changes but the changes were still relevant to the system for which they were selected.\n \n To say otherwise I would need to imply that all changes which aren't necessarily useful to the current system are immediately ended, obviously that is wrong.\n \n Let's look at what I meant when I said 'the explaination', given the context I am sure you must agree that 'the explaination' is 'the explaination of production'.\n \n What does the QWERTY key arrangement have to do with the production of a keyboard?\n \n Did it help it's electric parts in anyway?\n \n Perhaps it inspired a computer engineer?\n \n In fact the QWERTY key arrangement has nothing to do with the production of the keyboard because no one was thinking of a keyboard when they came up with QWERTY.\n \n If you want to explain the existance of a feature you may have to go back to when there was selection for that feature, that is ceded and was never contended.\n \n What was contended is that if you want to explain the existance of a feature you need a relevant selection.\n \n Now obviously in the case of man made objects that is pretty easy to produce because a person can imagine something before it exists and uses that abstraction as the standard of selection.\n \n Let me take this analogy in another light to show co-option.\n \n The existance of this key-<input mechanism could be said to be co-option for a keyboard.\n \n Having a list of characters which are depressed to input data is certainly a common feature between keyboards and type writers.\n \n So let's take the existance of type writers as a given and use it as co-option for a keyboard.\n \n Can I then explain the existance of a keyboard?\n \n \"Hey Mr. Teacher? How did we get keyboards?\"\n \"Well Tommy it has much in common with a typewriter\"\n \"Huh? it's a typewriter?\"\n \"A type writer with some small modifications yes\"\n \"Could type writers plug into computers?\"\n \"No that was the slight modification\"\n \n Now Matthew I am sure you are rolling your eyes (or some equivalent) because you know very well that the relatively simple chips in keyboards exceed the complexity of typewriters as a whole.\n \n This is in fact the reason co-option is not convincing, similarity could exist; but there is no reason for it. The closer you come to saying A = B (Typewriter is a keyboard) the less mutation is necessary but the more unlikely the actual similarity becomes.\n \n Why would there be silicon chips in a type writer? Why would they be in the correct layout to connect to non-existent computer systems?\n The limit would be asserting the system already existed and evolved from itself *Yes I have heard that.\n \n The entire novelty of a computer system stands there, all the co-option of the world prior to them helpless to explain it for in the very act of being co-option for the computer the novelty is neutralized.\n All that remains is the chance that one system has the same structure as another.\n \n The divergence of straight mutation + the unity of co-option play parts of the whole, neither capable of escaping the whole odds.\n It could be all co-option or all mutation or some mix, but it will have about the same odds.\n \n \nRandom with respect to the ultimate structure? \"Indifferent\" to it, in Coyne's sense? Yes. But -- and this is important -- not random or indifferent in any \"absolute\" sense. And certainly not unexplainable.\n\n Not unexplainable no, your analogy was perfect. You may use past selections to explain past productions and you may use past productions to explain current features but you may not use irrelevant selections to explain relevant productions.\n \n QWERTY is a random feature in a keyboard, of course it can be explained but by your own admission it has no objective purpose in the keyboard.\n Use QWERTY to explain the production of a keyboard without relying on random (indifferent) or coincidental happenings and you will have defeated my argument.\n \n \nSo if it doesn't work, it isn't even empirical? How does that follow?\n\n *Sigh, so again contextual assumptions bite me in the XXX.\n Your question was in response to \n \n \"You can't have empirical evidence of co-option occurring because the only evidence for co-option after the fact would be homology.\"\n \n The evidence for homology is empirical.\n \n Homology is a necessary condition of co-option occurring.\n You can't prove something happened by merely noting that one of it's necessary conditions is met however.\n \n So if you would allow me to correct my statement with more explicit terms it should be 'Insofar as homology is not empirical proof that the fitness landscape is sufficiently saturated to allow consistent co-opting of novel systems it is not empirical evidence for that'.\n \n \n \nWell, what do you think similarities are evidence of, given that such similarities don't have to obtain at all?\n\n Common descent, which by the way also implies that systems will have co-option with themselves over the variants that exist in time.\n \n \nBut this is a terrible analogy with trying to arrange fossils in sequence. Unlike dots, the fossils aren't identical, but some resemble each other more closely than others. Moreover, the background isn't uniform, but stratified into datable layers. And there is no rule that there must be one line, without branches.\n \n There are certainly disagreements about how to arrange things. But it's hardly an arbitrary process.\n\n I wasn't talking about fossils I was talking about the implications of relying on co-option to explain novel systems.\n Co-option is from another system, if all systems came from other systems you will have a circuit and I have noted some of the small circular eddies.\n \n \nChapter 5 of Miller's Finding Darwin's God discusses numerous such discussions, which start by saying what could happen and then try to figure out what did on the basis of evidence. Look at the original papers cited there, and then get back to me.\n\n Normally I would oblige but am so certain that the only evidence for co-option that could possibly be presented is homology, followed by the assertion that it must have happened because we see the system exists that I am going to update what I said and say this is a splendid opportunity for you to show my ignorance.\n \n \nAgain, I think this is a total misrepresentation of how evolutionary sequences are reconstructed. It's not a matter of convenience, but where evidence leads.\n\n The evidence is homology and the existance of these systems, nothing else.\n and no evidence can prove the impossible.\n \n At best you could have evidence that systems really did just randomly appear.\n \n \n \nDon't pretend evolution says that things happened for no reason.\n\n Don't pretend that a change in allele frequencies in a population over time says things happened for no reason... You got it, it's people who do that :p\n \n \nI don't doubt that language carries ontological commitments. What I object to is your use of \"only\" such that evolutions actual path turns out to be a necessary path, rather than a contingent path. Maybe it was! And maybe it wasn't. The empirical evidence is quite compatible with either, and I object to the attempt to build one and \"only\" one metaphysic directly into what the empirical evidence tells us.\n\n What are you talking about? Are you saying that I claimed that the proposed evolutionary tree must be necessary?\n \n \nAnd I have already addressed why it isn't, so I feel no inclination to do so again. This insistent \"declaration\" is groundless, in my view -- indeed, empirical evidence flies directly in its face.\n\n Well then it appears this string of debate is at an end because as far as I can tell you have presented no empirical evidence which contradicts anything I have said nor have you been able to counter my support for this declaration.\n \n \nAnd to analogize evolution to appearance by luck is just grossly wrong.\n\n I am sorry I can't help it if this sounds useless, but: stop doing it then..\n \n \nAnd I would say, where evolution is concerned, they're parts of the process.\n\n So a sum of coincidences can be anything other than a coincidence?\n \n \nBut not all selection that leads to a final structure is relevant to it! Some of it is coincidental! SO WHAT?!?\n\n So if it's a coincidence there is no reason to expect it to produce the structure.\n \n Just like it is a coincidence that a mutation happens to be beneficial, there is no reason to expect it to be beneficial.\n \n and hey look I claim that single mutations cannot be guided (produced) too.\n The only error is that when you start talking about systems with the same implications as single mutations the odds of spontaneous (random) generation start to get pretty bad most of the time.\n \n \n This hardly reduces the entire evolutionary path to randomness. It just means that selective pressures have changed over time, yet their effects remain.\n\n It only reduces those parts which are irrelavant to randomness, no selection can be relavant before a system exists to enable a selection pressure so it reduces all previous selection events to random with respect to that system.\n \n \nIt just means that selective pressures have changed over time, yet their effects remain.\n\n the effects of neutral mutations and vestigal systems remain as well, and there is no reason to expect they will form a novel system either.\n \n \n \nI'm leaning toward the latter.\n\n If you are sure you have rebutted my points please do so sooner rather than later.\n \n \nTalk about a straw man! I have never said THAT is the reason for my \"semantics\" charge. My point with that charge -- as exemplified early in this post -- is that your \"guided genetic change\" does not seem appreciably different from \"mutation plus natural selection.\" At best, a mere redescription.\n \n \n \n Another straw man. My charge is and always has been much more specific. Empirical evidence does not indicate that mutations have intrinsic directionality. Empirical evidence does not indicate that actual evolutionary paths were the only possible paths, i.e., necessary paths. By trying to build such ideas into how evolution works, I think you are engaging in a metaphysical rather than properly scientific project. One that might well be true, but certainly isn't justified by the empirical evidence. (And one that ultimately, I think is false, because it flies in the face of that evidence.)\n\n Since neither of the mentioned charges have a basis in my argument, I think I will talk about strawmen.",

   "I'm not going to respond to most of this, as I don't think there's much point. I just want to make clear a bit of my own confusion.\n \n \n[Matthew:] if natural selection is what guides guided genetic change, then why is this anything other than a mere redescription of the phenomena in question?\n\n \n As I said they are not identical, you say it's natural selection because it is directly based on natural selection.\n \n It however deals with series of changes as opposed to a single boolean alternative (yes, no , null).\n \n It is a namespace for identifying what natural selection means to evolutionary production, and it wouldn't be necessary if people would think about it themselves.\n \n Let me illustrate this with an example, a single mutation happens and is selected.\n \n The guided genetic change test returns negative, that means the change was not produced.\n \n Assuredly there was selection and that explains why the mutation became prevalent among all other mutations but the change was not produced it was 'taken advantage of' to use a common phrase.\n \n As previously described natural selection if it were a function takes a mutation and it's benefit as arguments and returns a change in allele frequencies based on where that mutation is located. Guided genetic change takes a genetic change, that is two different sequences and the mutations and the selections on the path between those systems and returns a boolean (yes, no, null) as to whether the genetic change was guided. (produced).\n \n In the case of producing anything it is an A to B change that is being discussed which means guided genetic change test should apply, at the very least because natural selection alone cannot incorporate the idea of multiple events.\n \n Natural selection is to guided genetic change as y = 5 is to f(x) = 3x+2.\n four mutations happen, three of them are selected due to similarity with the final system; the fourth completes the genetic change in question.\n The change was guided, the final selection is excluded because the production of the system has already happened, and practically you don't have to worry about it unless you are intentionally testing a non-beneficial system.\n\n \n Not much of this makes any sense to me at all, for a variety of reasons.\n \n 1. \"a single mutation happens and is selected.\"\n \n Which means what, as you see it? Because here's how I see it: an indidvidual undergoes a mutation, and this mutation helps that individual survive and/or reproduce more effectively than other memebers of the individuals population.\n \n And of course, having reproduced, that individual passes on this mutation to at least some portion of its offspring, who (on average) gain the same benefit surviving and reproducing. And so on and so forth. That's what the process of natural selection entails.\n \n 2. \"The guided genetic change test returns negative, that means the change was not produced.\"\n \n First of all, I am unclear what \"the guided genetic change test\" even is, let alone how it's anything but circular to invoke it in the explanation of what \"guided genetic change\" is.\n \n Second, your use of \"produced\" seems here -- and through much of this post, I should add -- very different than what you had said before. Earlier, we said production was a matter of \"bringing into existence.\" Now it seems to be a matter of \"guidance,\" and this will be amply confirmed in due course. So I'm sorry: when you use terms like \"produce\" or \"production\" I continue to be very confused. It does not seem to me that you are applying this term consistently or precisely. And it's creating a gigantic problem for me trying to figure out what you're driving at.\n \n 3. \"Assuredly there was selection and that explains why the mutation became prevalent among all other mutations...\"\n \n And here, you lose me yet again. I'm not talking about prevalence among a host of mutations. I've always been talking about the prevalence of a feature within a population -- a feature that starts as a mutation, is passed on via the mechanisms of inheritance, is selected for by various features of the environment, and hence winds up increasingly \"prevalent\" in the population as a result.\n \n I thought this is what you meant, when you were talking about natural selection explaining prevalence, too. Now it appears not. And I don't understand what the above-quoted passage means. Moreover...\n \n 4. \"... but the change was not produced it was 'taken advantage of' to use a common phrase.\"\n \n ...I do not understand what this means either. Certainly it no longer seems that there is any sense of \"produced\" as \"coming into existence\" here. And I don't see why there's any discord between being \"produced\" and being \"taken advantage of.\" The usual definitional mess.\n \n 5. \"As previously described natural selection if it were a function takes a mutation and it's benefit as arguments and returns a change in allele frequencies based on where that mutation is located.\"\n \n Once again, I just don't know what this means. In what sense is natural selection \"taking\" mutations or their benefits \"as arguments?\" And \"located\" where? What natural selection changes are the allele frequencies in the population, not in the inidividual. Or rather, while yes, a mutation might well change an individual's alleles in the sense that it gets an altogether new one, replaces one with another, or loses another, what's relevant to evolution is the change in allele frequencies within the population.\n \n 6. \"Guided genetic change takes a genetic change, that is two different sequences and the mutations and the selections on the path between those systems and returns a boolean (yes, no, null) as to whether the genetic change was guided. (produced).\"\n \n Okay, first note that here, the parenthesis indicates that \"produced\" means \"guided.\" I certainly don't recall that this is how we used the term before.\n \n Beyond that -- well, what comes next is I guess supposed to clarify this idea, so let's just dive right into that:\n \n 7. (6A?) \"In the case of producing anything it is an A to B change that is being discussed which means guided genetic change test should apply, at the very least because natural selection alone cannot incorporate the idea of multiple events.\"\n \n I'm sorry, but I don't follow this at all. Why can't natural selection \"incorporate the idea of multiple events?\" An individual's genes mutate, and on the basis of some kind and degree of benefit, the individual is selected for (let's say): it leaves more offspring than its competitors. It passes on its genes to its offspring, and those sharing the mutation leave more offspring (on average) than their competitors (including their own siblings who lack the mutation). And so on and so forth. It's a whole series of individual selection events.\n \n And then another mutation can occur, conferring another benefit. It kicks off a whole new series of selection events. And another mutation, with further selection, and another, with further, and so on and so forth. Whole series of mutations, whole series of selection events.\n \n What exactly is natural selection incapable of here?\n \n And beyond that (to return to point 6) how do we discern any \"guidance\" here? Pick an arbitrary starting point and an arbitrary ending point: there's a whole series of mutations and selection events that gets you there. Where do we discern \"guidance?\"\n \n 8. \"Natural selection is to guided genetic change as y = 5 is to f(x) = 3x+2.\"\n \n What?!?\n \n Is this just a clever way of saying they're totally different or something?\n \n 9. \"four mutations happen, three of them are selected due to similarity with the final system; the fourth completes the genetic change in question.\"\n \n So natural selection is operating not based on present conditions, but on future conditions? I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you're driving at here. Whether or not a given mutation allows individuals to produce more offspring than there competitors is a matter of the now, and that's all that matters. If somewhere down the road, a further mutation happens that confers benefit in the same direction, then once again, at this later present, there will be more offspring. And so for the third and the fourth. But the further mutations don't have to happen. And the selections for the earlier mutations weren't based on their similarity to what would come about with the fourth: those earlier selections were based on the benefits the earlier mutations provided at the time the earlier mutations occurred.\n \n Perhaps the part I just italicized is the basic disagreement we're having? I don't know. I'm just trying to figure out what you're driving at and coming up pretty empty.\n \n 10. \"The change was guided, the final selection is excluded because the production of the system has already happened, and practically you don't have to worry about it unless you are intentionally testing a non-beneficial system.\"\n \n But why was the change \"guided?\" It gets from A to B sure -- but where is the guidance? Where is there anything other than mutation and natural selection, simply doing what they do, no guidance necessary?\n \n -----\n \n Beyond the above, I only want to address some brief portions of the remainder:\n \n \nSo a sum of coincidences can be anything other than a coincidence?\n\n \n Nope! But evolution doesn't postulate nothing more than coincidences. Whether a given mutation happens to enable greater reproductive success is not a coincidence.\n \n \nSo if it's a coincidence there is no reason to expect it to produce the structure.\n \n Just like it is a coincidence that a mutation happens to be beneficial, there is no reason to expect it to be beneficial.\n\n \n That's right: there is no such reason to expect this out of a mutation itself. Because whether or not the mutation is beneficial depends on something else, namely the environmental conditions.\n \n All we can say is, if the environmental conditions are such that the mutation in question is beneficial, then it will tend to spread throughout the population.\n \n \nthe effects of neutral mutations and vestigal systems remain as well, and there is no reason to expect they will form a novel system either.\n\n \n That's right. Maybe they will, and maybe they won't. It's kind of hard to predict in advance, eh?\n \n ------\n \n Aside from this, I don't really know what to do except basically sum up. It seems to me that there is still no consistent usage even just for the term \"production\" in your ideas, and your most recent post has made it even less clear than ever. I feel like there are big leaps being taken at times as well, as though the connections between what you're saying are as obvious to me (or the rest of us) as they are to you -- for as you note elsewhere in the post: \" again contextual assumptions bite me in the XXX.\"\n \n For these reasons I don't really think it's worth the effort for me to go into the rest of the post. I still don't see what \"guided genetic change\" is, primarily what's \"guided\" about it. I still don't see what \"production\" means. I still don't see why there's any problem at all with co-option. And I still don't see any emprical evidence for what you are -- or seem to be -- claiming (and admittedly, I'm not sure what you're claiming, so I dont' know what sort of empirical evidence I should even be looking for).\n \n I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that all these \"failures of vision\" may be my fault alone. But truthfully, I really don't think so. I don't think you're being clear, even though I know that you think so, and I know you're trying hard to be as clear as possible for me.\n \n I yield you the last word if you wish to avail yourself of it.",

You have never addressed the fact that the only reason you are considering A is because it became B and only considering B because it happened to occur at all. \n \n My point is that there is a good point to be made that when you are working with odds you have to take into account not only the end result and all possible end results, but all the starting hands that could have resulted in something like the end result for you to consider. You have never dealt with this directly only saying appeal to odds.\n \n I have a huge problem with that since an appeal to odds is quite relevant and by no means a logical fallacy in the context it's being presented. If something can be understood as likely instead of very unlikely, don't you think whatever leads you to conclude this should be considered?\n \n The only reason you aren't calculating the odds of a cell developing some function that allows it to collect solar energy without chloroplasts is because that cell doesn't exist. Nature has already figured out a way, but there is no doubt in my mind that there is a much better way nature could have done it. In fact, there are probably millions of ways it could be done.

That's all it needed.\n \n Just wanted to point this out because you are always working off of this model under the assumption that the way things happened is where we need to focus to validate the model of natural selection.

In what sense is natural selection \"taking\" mutations or their benefits \"as arguments?\" And \"located\" where?\n\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)\n \n The gene variant which contains the beneficial mutation must be known in order to alter it's frequency. This is inherent in well inheritance but I was being complete.\n \n \nWhat natural selection changes are the allele frequencies in the population, not in the inidividual.\n\n That changes everything, I can't believe I have been so ignorant...\n \n \nwhat's relevant to evolution is the change in allele frequencies within the population.\n\n Isn't that what evolution is?\n \n \n6. \"Guided genetic change takes a genetic change, that is two different sequences and the mutations and the selections on the path between those systems and returns a boolean (yes, no, null) as to whether the genetic change was guided. (produced).\"\n\n First I want to note that when I defined it verbally it returned a boolean value, but the equation I gave trebor actually gives percentage of guidance.\n \nOkay, first note that here, the parenthesis indicates that \"produced\" means \"guided.\" I certainly don't recall that this is how we used the term before.\n\n I addressed this in response to 2.\n \n \n7. (6A?) \"In the case of producing anything it is an A to B change that is being discussed which means guided genetic change test should apply, at the very least because natural selection alone cannot incorporate the idea of multiple events.\"\n\n \nI'm sorry, but I don't follow this at all. Why can't natural selection \"incorporate the idea of multiple events?\" An individual's genes mutate, and on the basis of some kind and degree of benefit, the individual is selected for (let's say): it leaves more offspring than its competitors. It passes on its genes to its offspring, and those sharing the mutation leave more offspring (on average) than their competitors (including their own siblings who lack the mutation). And so on and so forth. It's a whole series of individual selection events.\n \n And then another mutation can occur, conferring another benefit. It kicks off a whole new series of selection events. And another mutation, with further selection, and another, with further, and so on and so forth. Whole series of mutations, whole series of selection events.\n \n What exactly is natural selection incapable of here?\n\n Natural selection is incapable of simultaneously having multiple instances and being singular.\n \n Meaning that there can be multiple selections but not without having the concept of natural selection apply to each individually, it is tautologous.\n \n Natural selection is defined to be based on current benefit, forever locked to the present.\n \n If you start talking about past selections and future selections you are already talking about multiple selections; i.e. natural selection does not incorporate the idea of multiple events it is multiple.\n \n \nAnd beyond that (to return to point 6) how do we discern any \"guidance\" here? Pick an arbitrary starting point and an arbitrary ending point: there's a whole series of mutations and selection events that gets you there. Where do we discern \"guidance?\"\n\n The start and end are arbitrary insofar as we choose them based on what we want to analyze at the time.\n \n There are different orders of mutation but the mutations that reduce genetic differential are finite.\n \n The guidance natural selection provides is, to use an analogy; 'warmer, colder'.\n \n It guides the genome to the final sequence by filtering out other directions.\n \n If it is incapable of filtering out other directions then it will not guide, this is why the condition 'due to similarity with B' is inserted as opposed to just 'selected'.\n \n \n8. \"Natural selection is to guided genetic change as y = 5 is to f(x) = 3x+2.\"\nWhat?!?\n \n Is this just a clever way of saying they're totally different or something?\n\n Natural selection is analogous to the instantaneous guidance of a genome.\n \n Guided genetic change is about a series of selections just as a function of x is about a series of y values.\n \n \n9. \"four mutations happen, three of them are selected due to similarity with the final system; the fourth completes the genetic change in question.\"\nSo natural selection is operating not based on present conditions, but on future conditions?\n\n No, we are using the fact that the standard of selection in a series of mutations was a non-existent 'ideal' sequence to explain that sequence.\n \n \nI'm sorry, but I don't understand what you're driving at here. Whether or not a given mutation allows individuals to produce more offspring than there competitors is a matter of the now, and that's all that matters. If somewhere down the road, a further mutation happens that confers benefit in the same direction, then once again, at this later present, there will be more offspring. And so for the third and the fourth. But the further mutations don't have to happen. And the selections for the earlier mutations weren't based on their similarity to what would come about with the fourth: those earlier selections were based on the benefits the earlier mutations provided at the time the earlier mutations occurred.\n \n Perhaps the part I just italicized is the basic disagreement we're having? I don't know. I'm just trying to figure out what you're driving at and coming up pretty empty.\n\n Whew! you are correct selection cares only for immediate benefit, but our explanations cannot.\n \n The fact that evolutionary stories have any explanatory power is because we use our post event conceptualization to recognize the pattern that would be produced if the standard of production was the system we were trying to explain.\n \n When explaining some huge claws that a creature has one would explain how every increase in claw size increased benefit.\n \n The implied and necessary connection there is that since larger and larger claws were making the claws more similar to the huge claws the limit of that similarity is identity.\n \n If you really wanted to explain them but you insisted on pretending you were natural selection you would be going 'mutation... benefit, who knows why....... mutation... benefit, who knows why', in fact the final system would take the same form.\n \n So no I am not saying natural selection does things based on the future, in fact that false proposition is why IC the argument exists, i.e. natural selection cannot do things based on future systems.\n \n I am saying that directions must exist for natural selection to produce anything but more genetic noise.\n \n \n10. \"The change was guided, the final selection is excluded because the production of the system has already happened, and practically you don't have to worry about it unless you are intentionally testing a non-beneficial system.\"\n\n \nBut why was the change \"guided?\" It gets from A to B sure -- but where is the guidance? Where is there anything other than mutation and natural selection, simply doing what they do, no guidance necessary?\n\n There was nothing other than natural selection and random mutation doing what they do, just doing it over again and over again and possibly producing a coherent change. What you find necessary seems to be at the heart of this debate.\n \n \nNope! But evolution doesn't postulate nothing more than coincidences. Whether a given mutation happens to enable greater reproductive success is not a coincidence.\n\n Whether a given mutation that enables a greater reproductive success happens to be a part of a non-existent system is.\n \n \nThat's right: there is no such reason to expect this out of a mutation itself. Because whether or not the mutation is beneficial depends on something else, namely the environmental conditions.\n \n All we can say is, if the environmental conditions are such that the mutation in question is beneficial, then it will tend to spread throughout the population.\n\n You seem to say more, that is what I have a problem with.\n \n \nThat's right. Maybe they will, and maybe they won't. It's kind of hard to predict in advance, eh?\n\n I wonder if gravity will affect me today? or will fires still be plasma easily pushed by the wind growing in contact with combustibles?\n \n It's kind of hard to predict in advance, eh?\n \n \nAside from this, I don't really know what to do except basically sum up. It seems to me that there is still no consistent usage even just for the term \"production\" in your ideas, and your most recent post has made it even less clear than ever. I feel like there are big leaps being taken at times as well, as though the connections between what you're saying are as obvious to me (or the rest of us) as they are to you -- for as you note elsewhere in the post: \" again contextual assumptions bite me in the XXX.\"\n\n In my defense the contextual assumptions were not out of the blue but based on previous exchanges.\n \n The fact is that without them we would literally have to repeat the synopsis of everything already said every post.\n \n \nI still don't see any emprical evidence for what you are -- or seem to be -- claiming (and admittedly, I'm not sure what you're claiming, so I dont' know what sort of empirical evidence I should even be looking for).\n\n Nice save :)\n \n There is no empirical evidence you should be looking for. I have made an argument not an assertion about some existent, and the premises on which the argument is based are shared; I should know because they are repeated to me often when some one freaks out and tries to cut off the expansion of analysis by returning to the starting point of the analysis namely those premises.\n \n \nI am perfectly willing to acknowledge that all these \"failures of vision\" may be my fault alone. But truthfully, I really don't think so. I don't think you're being clear, even though I know that you think so, and I know you're trying hard to be as clear as possible for me.\n \n I yield you the last word if you wish to avail yourself of it.\n\n kk\n \n \nYou always put things in context of A to B. You have never addressed the fact that the only reason you are considering A is because it became B and only considering B because it happened to occur at all. \n\n Typically yes, uh how should I address it?\n \n \n \nMy point is that there is a good point to be made that when you are working with odds you have to take into account not only the end result and all possible end results, but all the starting hands that could have resulted in something like the end result for you to consider. You have never dealt with this directly only saying appeal to odds.\n\n Well forgive my failing memory but I think I agreed with you, the number of trails will certainly effect the final odds.\n \n I called 'appeal to odds' when you tried to use odds to justify what you claimed was a non-random production caused by natural selection.\n \n It is like saying 'the dice will roll four' then saying 'the dice could roll four'.\n \n The moment you admit that you are claiming the production of novel systems are random we can move on to the odds and you can bid farewell to 'appeal to odds'.\n \n \nIf something can be understood as likely instead of very unlikely, don't you think whatever leads you to conclude this should be considered?\n\n Yes\n \n \nThe only reason you aren't calculating the odds of a cell developing some function that allows it to collect solar energy without chloroplasts is because that cell doesn't exist.\n\n I have already explained to you why you cannot base your appraisal of the odds on the assumption that the fitness landscape is saturated with functions.\n \n \nNature has already figured out a way, but there is no doubt in my mind that there is a much better way nature could have done it. In fact, there are probably millions of ways it could be done. Nature figured out one way. That's all it needed.\n\n and since you feel it's inevitable that random mutation produce a solar energy collection system given how many of them there are you do not feel the need to explain it's production as anything but an accident, and it's prevalence is explained by it's benefit, no?\n \n \nJust wanted to point this out because you are always working off of this model under the assumption that the way things happened is where we need to focus to validate the model of natural selection.\n\n Yea that is kinda where I focus my attention. Not that I don't think you and all the other 'scientist' who imagine these wonderful worlds aren't very creative.\n \n In fact I myself find it addictive interesting to imagine what systems could be built with biology, indeed which we could build.\n \n \nThe ways things happened to come about is irrelevant. Instead we need to focus on all the possible outcomes a mutation could render.\n\n and see how many of them are novel functions?\n \n Doesn't nature run that experiment every day in the uncountable numbers of sequences that are randomly generated?\n \n There are only two possibilities given how many mutations have happened since we started monitoring this stuff, and how many novel systems we have seen appear.\n \n Either the number of possible systems have been severely reduced because most of them exist already, or the ratio was almost none forever.\n \n The former is probably what you would choose and it does imply that the way things happened is how they must have happened (within a range of course).",

Why are they still around is answered with natural selection.\n \n \n \nAs is anyone who tells an evolutionary story and uses the product as the standard of selection.\n\n \n Yes, but were not saying it was likely to happen the way it did.

The problem here is that that isn't what an evolutionist is looking for except when they are trying to back up their theories against a creationist claiming it could not have happened period.

Look, evolution makes predictions about information in the genome, intermediate species, etc etc etc. It is tested every time we look at features of life around us and it falls into place. And gravity does make things go up. Gravity causes balloons to rise.\n \n \nAny physicists who was not already infuriated would ask you what the hell the theory of gravity is then, they would discover as I discovered that there isn't one in your mind.\n\n \n That's because no one understands gravity.

Let me define evolution for you, but first your definition:\n Evolution is change (I speculate in a genome.)\n \n The real definition:\n Evolution is a process by which beneficial changes (mutations) in a genome of a species are increased in frequency by a process of natural selection. This result is an increase in beneficial information contained in a gene pool of a specific group and subsequent divergence in gene pools leads to variation and speciation. The theory of evolution suggests that all life on Earth descended from a common ancestor. \n \n Your point was that evolution has made itself vague and therefore can't be disproven. It seems pretty specific to me, there are numerous chances for someone to disprove evolution. The problem is no one has found anything yet. Kind of like how no one has found any evidence that the Earth is flat. \n \n \nI look for the rules in evolution, the predictions and principles of explaination present in any truly scientific idea and you accuse me of making up rules.\n\n \n So the \"guided mutation test\" wasn't yours?\n \n \n \n \nFailing to disprove imposbility is not an explaination of occurance.\n\n \n Is that a triple negative?

Why are they still around is answered with natural selection.\n\n i.e. the question was 'why are they still around'.\n \n \n \n \nBoth. Why is this not OK?\n\n Something cannot be random and a proven cause-phenomenon relationship (theory) at the same time.\n \n Without a proposed process to non-randomly produce biological systems you cannot claim you know what causes them so what causes them cannot be evolution.\n \n If the dice rolls 5 every single time it is cast you cannot say the reason is because it is random.\n \n If the dice rolls random numbers but you only show people the five, then the rolls are still random which means you still don't have a cause for rolling fives.\n \n \nAgain, there are no odds to calculate. What are the odds of drawing a specific card from a deck of cards of unknown number of cards? Depends on how many cards there are obviously. The important question is what percentage of the cards will give you a winning hand.\n\n Tell me.\n \n \nYou should probably use a universal terminology. \n\n If it existed.\n \n \n \n \nNot the why, the how. The problem here is that that isn't what an evolutionist is looking for except when they are trying to back up their theories against a creationist claiming it could not have happened period. Disproving this statement only requires one possible path, this is true. If you can find one exception to Fermat's Last Theorem, since it hasn't been proven, then you can prove it wrong. You are the one claiming Fermats Last Theorem can't be true, metaphorically speaking. \n\n I have claimed and supported the claim that the non-random mechanism of random mutation filtered by natural selection is incapable of producing an novel system.\n \n I am not interested in proving anything else.\n \n Since I made the arguments in the abstract I have not only found one exception, I have found them all.\n \n btw I thought that theorem was proven?\n \n \nOh, great, the old evolution doesn't follow the scientific method gripe. Look, evolution makes predictions about information in the genome, intermediate species, etc etc etc. It is tested every time we look at features of life around us and it falls into place.\n\n If the magic evolution box worked, then we would have common descent. We have common descent so the magic evolution box must work.\n \n \n And gravity does make things go up. Gravity causes balloons to rise.\n\n Applying pressure gradients to geysers is about as proper as applying irrelevant selections and claiming they render the outcome predictable.\n \n \nThat's because no one understands gravity. No physicist on Earth knows what gravity is other than the old warping of space time definition. \n\n http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/f/3/0f36df929ac9d711a8ba8c5658c3bfee.png\n \n We don't know what causes gravity but we know what gravity causes.\n \n We know what causes natural selection and mutations but you are mistaken about what they can cause.\n \n \nNo this isn't true. Let me define evolution for you, but first your definition:\n Evolution is change (I speculate in a genome.)\n\n So much dissension.\n \n Bennedict and pandion (both of whom claim to be in the biological academic sphere) agreed that evolution is essentially genetic change over time.\n \n MrWriteLA signature has a quote that has repeatedly entered my mind since I started debating evolutionist.\n \n \"Ridicule is the only weapon which can be used against unintelligible propositions. Ideas must be distinct before reason can act upon them.\"\n -- Thomas Jefferson\n \n \n \nThe real definition:\n Evolution is a process by which beneficial changes (mutations) in a genome of a species are increased in frequency by a process of natural selection. This result is an increase in beneficial information contained in a gene pool of a specific group and subsequent divergence in gene pools leads to variation and speciation. The theory of evolution suggests that all life on Earth descended from a common ancestor. \n\n I am fine with that.\n \n No novelty was mentioned, nor was any production.\n \n Simply cause and effect, science as it should be.\n \n Suggestion is a perfect word, it does not claim that how this would happen is known (given that life advanced) simply that speciation under divergent selection pressures is possible.\n \n \nYour point was that evolution has made itself vague and therefore can't be disproven. It seems pretty specific to me, there are numerous chances for someone to disprove evolution. The problem is no one has found anything yet. Kind of like how no one has found any evidence that the Earth is flat. \n\n It's follow the cups huh, well I know exactly what I am disproving and change over time nor an if - then benefit - allele frequency change is not it.\n \n I have defined irrational evolution many times 'The theory by which all life advanced from a single cell to the current bio-sphere'.\n \n That definition does not suggest, it claims that it IS THAT THEORY! (booming jeopardy voice).\n \n \nSo the \"guided mutation test\" wasn't yours?\n\n Of course it was, I do not denying making up rules.\n \n I deny that such an act is improper.\n \n My premises are correct, even the analysis was done by someone else first.\n \n I merely expanded and then condensed the expansion to bare essential elements.\n \n \n \nIs that a triple negative? What does this even mean? Do you mean failing to prove impossibility?\n\n Yes, It means that just because someone hasn't proven something is impossible doesn't mean it happened (appeal to ignorance), No I did not mean that.\n \n \nOh never mind - did you take some logic classes in your liberal studies program?\n\n Failing is a special case, it's negative cannot be canceled, in fact it nullifies the following.\n \n But if it helps: Failing to prove possibility is not an explaination of occurrence.",

   "I don't really understand why you are attacking natural selection. You have not even put forth any logic against it. Clearly natural selection is not random. I hope you can agree with this.\n \n Your argument used to be that a mutation that causes a novel function cannot happen randomly (with a random mutation). But you do accept that a random mutation can cause improvement. You have not given any way for us to differentiate how the two type of mutations are different other than the fact that one causes a new function and one does not. \n \n With this, you ignore many things. You ignore that a function does not need a mutation to come about. Changes in environment, shifting niches, population explosions or reductions, extinction events, etc etc can all cause a function or feature to take on a new importance. In other words, in your words I guess, the \"guided mutation\" changes course. \n \n You ignore co-option. To you, a feature that does one thing cannot do another. It cannot have double benefit. This is important because if one function exists and drives mutation towards a certain form where it picks up an additional function and the original function is subsequently lost through streamlining you would have what is an IC system. That is, the steps to get there seem irrational since they are not part of its current function. To you, this is unreasonable. You have not given any reason as to why.\n \n So to say you have won any of our previous debates, you will need to explain why the aforementioned processes cannot take place. You keep saying we have had this argument and that you won. Hardly until you can get rid of these gaps in your argument which make up the meat of mine. \n \n As to your statement that a random process cannot explain a theory - hogwash.

You are now arguing against NS. \n \n \nNatural selection isn't random with respect to benefit, but what no one ever told me and I didn't even think of for a long time is that benefit may be random with respect to non-existent sequences.\n\n \n Benefit is never random.

I hope you can agree with this.\n\n Attacking? How could I attack a concept like natural selection?\n \n Natural selection is not random period.\n \n Usually when we say something is random we mean it is random period, however; there are times when we say 'well that's just a random factor you can't rely on it' when it is not absolutely random but merely random to what the subject material is.\n \n When the word random is used in this sense it is equivalent to indifferent as matthew pointed out.\n \n Stock movements for instance are not random.\n \n Stock movements with respect to what you need to buy a new car are.\n \n That is to say regardless of what you would like or need from stock movements to get a car they will not be affected by that need.\n \n It is also to say that stock movements are indifferent to your need.\n \n It is also to say there is no causal relation from your need to stock movements even if there is one from stock movements to a new car.\n \n Saying that without guided genetic change natural selection is (random with respect to || indifferent to) is not an 'Attack' on natural selection it is attack on the string, the only string; that can connect natural selection to production of sequences.\n \n That string is necessary to invoke natural selection in either improvement or novelty.\n \n Without that string natural selection may not have anything to do with production, it can only be used to explain a change in allele frequencies in the present.\n \n \nYour argument used to be that a mutation that causes a novel function cannot happen randomly (with a random mutation).\n\n If you mean can't as in there are cases where it is practically impossible, that is still an argument I am willing to make.\n \n If you mean can't as in strictly impossible, I have never argued that.\n \n \nBut you do accept that a random mutation can cause improvement. You have not given any way for us to differentiate how the two type of mutations are different other than the fact that one causes a new function and one does not. \n\n We don't differentiate between the mutations we differentiate between the productive differences between improvement and novelty.\n \n If a mutation improves and existing system that improvement was randomly produced, natural selection did not cause it; nothing predictable caused it.\n \n You don't have a theory about when and if mutations will be beneficial, I don't have a theory about when and if mutations will be beneficial; No one has a theory about when and if mutations will be beneficial.\n \n We have a theory about how mutations happen. We do not have a theory about whether they will be beneficial, neutral, or negative.\n \n We have a theory about how a dice side ends up on top. We do not have a theory that predicts the side the dice will roll on. (well we do but for the sake of argument).\n \n So what do I say about that improvement? What makes it 'evolvable' while a novel function forming mutation is not?\n \n Nothing.\n \n I say that this was not produced by guided genetic change, it's formation is entirely random.\n \n It cannot be explained by natural selection, you cannot explain it with natural selection.\n \n You can use natural selection to explain why it's frequency increased, nothing more.\n \n Does this mean natural selection is doomed to be used to explain production?\n \n Only if you have tunnel vision, only if you consider single mutations by themselves.\n \n You want to ask why I do not allow you to consider single mutations by themselves?\n \n You are allowed, feel free. If you do though, you will have even less chance of defeating my conclusion.\n \n My conclusion = random mutation filtered by natural selection does not explain the advancement of life.\n \n If you considered only single mutations I would then be able to argue that random mutation filtered by natural selection does not explain anything but the persistence of beneficial mutations.\n \n Guided genetic change is necessarily about a series of mutation/selection pairs.\n \n The question is, \"Well if we can't explain the production of any singular change, can we explain the production of an array of changes? (new sequence)\"\n \n You guys seem to have trouble concentrating on what I say no matter how many times I say it, I am going to highlight this part, this is the fundamental reasoning behind guided genetic change, and all evolutionary stories.Yes we can, even though each singular change must always be random if the ones which are not in the array are removed non-randomly the accumulated changes can non-randomly become the array.\n \n This being identified, that all evolutionary production must take this form or be deemed entirely random in origin; one can differentiate between improvement and novelty.\n \n The immediately apparent condition of that happening is that the changes which are not in the array are removed.\n \n The only tool we have to remove the changes not in the array is natural selection.\n #in natural selection selecting for and against something are two sides the same coin, selecting for is the same as selecting against the original, selecting against is selecting against the new and so you can see when changing too something new only selection for is relavant.\n \n Which means the only question left is 'will natural selection remove the proper changes'.\n \n That is a question which can only be answered by the concept of selective directions.\n \n That is a real and predictable relationship between benefit (the standard of natural selection) and the changes that are removed.\n \n This is where the difference can be seen, that relationship is possible if not necessary for improving and existing system.\n \n If you modify a system, the benefit or lack thereof following that modification will be based on that system.\n \n A direct causation connection straight from the functionality of the system through natural selection (via it's standard, benefit) to the concept of guided genetic change.\n \n We may then predict that an array of changes that improve functionality will be produced.\n \n The same statement can be summed up by saying we can predict that if only changes that improve the system are preserved we will end up with an improved system and that will be because of natural selection; it will not be a possibility but a process.\n \n This is the thinking that 'clicks' when people think they understand evolution.\n \n What follows is an extremely simple and well document logic error.\n \n A novel function is an improvement, not all improvements are novel functions.\n \n This thinking demonstrated how an improvement could be caused by natural selection.\n \n It did not show that all improvements could be caused by natural selection only that this case was an improvement and caused by natural selection.\n \n Every case (or at least every variety of case) must be put through the same evaluation.\n \n The other variety of case if a novel function, will natural selection remove changes that don't fall into the array of changes required to create one?\n \n Well let's try the same trick...\n \n If you modify a system, the benefit or lack thereof following that modification will be based on that system.... and no others.\n \n What connection can we discern between the standard of selection (benefit) and the array of changes?\n \n None, not none as in 'oh darn where did I place that thought' None as in 'after careful considering this committee concludes the subject is non-existent'.\n \n #I believe you argued that an improved system might not pass my guided genetic change test, that is possible; all it requires is a disconnect between the standard of benefit and the standard of the change; easily accomplished if the change is only beneficial after it has been produced not before.\n \n Change A happens, it's a slight improvement and moves the sequence towards a novel system, change B happens it's a slight improvement but moves the sequence away from a novel system, change C happens it's a detriment but it moves the sequence towards a novel system.\n \n Unless you can stand and lie to me, tell me that natural selection will select A and C instead of A and B you agree with that.\n \n BTW I admit it, this is as clear as I have the ability of being.\n \n \nWith this, you ignore many things. You ignore that a function does not need a mutation to come about.\n\n If you are talking about a sequence taking on a function due to environmental change I beg you to explain why I need consider the case.\n \n \nChanges in environment, shifting niches, population explosions or reductions, extinction events, etc etc can all cause a function or feature to take on a new importance. In other words, in your words I guess, the \"guided mutation\" changes course. \n\n The standards could change of course. Indeed of all the possible directions taken the one that is taken is only taken because of overarchingly insignificant benefit differences at the 'crossroads' which means not only can the standards change but the A -< B is also not predetermined and arbitrary.\n \n I thought that was so obvious it need not be mentioned.\n \n \nYou ignore co-option. \n\n If ignoring consists of writing the equivalent of ten pages addressing why it is not a substitute for natural selection (i.e. unable to render production non-random).\n \n \nTo you, a feature that does one thing cannot do another.\n\n It can do as many things as it does, it just doesn't matter in the least since no matter how many things a feature does; once it exists, it can do none while it does not yet exist.\n \n \nThis is important because if one function exists and drives mutation towards a certain form where it picks up an additional function and the original function is subsequently lost through streamlining \n\n Mutations alter DNA, this is important because if mutation altered DNA into a form where it picks up an additional function, the original one may be lost through streamlining and this will be a novel function.\n \n You repeat this to me as if I had not written that ten pages, it's like you wipe it from your memory.\n \n How can you forget that I know exactly what you mean when you say co-option, exactly what it is supposed to do?\n \n Your paragraph here reduces to 'if a novel function is formed because an existing feature happened to be modified to form a novel function then a novel function would have formed'.\n Quite tautologous but as I have asked every time you have said this 'why', or if you are offended by that word 'how was it caused' or if you don't care how it was caused and why it exists I would ask you to stop saying you know either.\n \n \nyou would have what is an IC system.\n\n All systems are IC, you do not need a special case to produce one unless you are claiming that is always the case.\n \n \nThat is, the steps to get there seem irrational since they are not part of its current function. To you, this is unreasonable. You have not given any reason as to why.\n\n I think the point is I am asking you why it wold be reasonable?\n \n I have defended my position of claiming that current benefit for current functions is the only way to connect natural selection to production by explaining the reasoning behind it; reasoning that fails with other connections.\n \n Since the definition of irrational evolution which you are defended requires that more connections are made, all I have asserted is that no one has made cases for those and this invalidates the hypothesis.\n \n It's like you seek to discredit my conclusion by using my defense of rational evolution to illustrate hypocrisy :p\n \n \nSo to say you have won any of our previous debates, you will need to explain why the aforementioned processes cannot take place. You keep saying we have had this argument and that you won. Hardly until you can get rid of these gaps in your argument which make up the meat of mine. \n\n Well I am happy that you pulled yourself together, which seems to mean you simply forgot what was said; but where I left off with you was you quiting after hundreds of posts (multiple times).\n \n It was in these many posts that met your demands for explaination, the many demands for explaination.\n \n So often did I meet them that you concluded you were getting no where and quit.\n \n So no I won't throw all that under the table because you have a new audience. I have already repeated most of the key points already anyway.\n \n \nAs to your statement that a random process cannot explain a theory -\n\n Oh no, random process cannot explain a theory; for that I have other theories but I am sure they would be offensive.\n \n \nhogwash. Evolution is not on a whole random.\n\n Whatever evolution is in this sentence...\n \n \nBenefit is never random. Benefit, as you would put it, is either true or false. This is in the since of, is this change better or worse than the previous condition. If it's better, we call it benefit.\n\n Correct\n \n \nWhat!? Freedom, this is at the very heart of evolution. You have even agreed with this at one time accepting that improvement can happen due to this very process. What are you smoking?\n\n I never accepted that, I believe improvements can be produced non-randomly.\n \n That alone excludes me from possible believers in that summary.\n \n \nI am pretty sure you have never been a believer in what I would call 'rational evolution.'\n\n Very flattering, but no I have made far to many mistakes. It is one of the reasons I now take reason so seriously.\n \n The bird who falls the most is the most careful flier.\n \n \nIt reminds me of this guy I used to debate over on the old New York Times forums. No creationist, he: a Randian Objectivist.\n\n What a coincidence, I am a objectivist :p\n \n \nThe guy was totally convinced in his own mind, and no matter how many people pointed out to him that he didn't make a lick of sense, he was never dissuaded.\n\n That's a fellow objectivist alright, totally insensitive to the quantity of arguments in favor of quality.\n \n \nWatching him debate with you now, I find him even less comprehensible than when he was debating me. And I didn't even think that was possible. I have no idea what he's trying to say any longer -- except that he's convinced that there is something deeply wrong with evolutionary biology as currently conceptualized and practiced, and that he has completely proved this in debate with the rest of us.\n\n I proved it to databed, you did not want to continue after even definitions could not be agreed upon.\n \n \nwow. it seems like since fartingle left, freedom felt the need to fill his shoes as being the resident anti-evolutionist nutter. i feel like making a compilation thread about all the ridiculous stuff he says. stuff like \"boolean value\" and \"guided mutation test\" lol. START MAKING SENSE, BOY!!!\n\n Feel free, being a mad egoist I of course would love to post in a thread about me :p (hope you didn't miss the randian pun there Matthew).",
