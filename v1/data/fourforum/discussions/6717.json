   "Probably CBS. They're known for integrity. Or lack thereof. Can you say, \"forged documents?\"\n \n Yeah, but who gave out pardons like they were candy?\nUm, I believe that would be George Herbert Walker Bush. From a Joe Conason column:\n \n http://www.salon.com/news/col/cona/2001/02/27/pardons/\n \n \n. . . .The widely and justly criticized pardons of Caspar Weinberger and other Iran-Contra defendants by George Herbert Walker Bush should have been just the beginning of that story. Yet, for reasons best known to the incorruptible watchdogs of the Washington press corps, Poppy's self-interested mercy upon Weinberger instigated no searching examination of the other pardons granted by the departing president. Indeed, the final dozen pardons given by Bush -- including the unexplained release of a Pakistani heroin trafficker -- received virtually no coverage at all. \n \n The elder Bush delivered a few highly questionable pardons well before his last days in office. The very first of his presidency went to Armand Hammer, the legendary oilman best known for his relationships with Soviet leaders dating back to Lenin. In an investigation that grew out of Watergate, Hammer had pleaded guilty in 1975 to laundering $54,000 in illicit contributions to Nixon's reelection war chest. By the summer of 1989, when Bush gave Hammer what he wanted, the aging chief of Occidental Petroleum had been pestering government officials on his own behalf for several years. . . .Flash forward to the very end of Poppy's presidency, a few weeks after his Christmas Eve 1992 pardons of Weinberger and the other Iran-Contra defendants. On Jan. 18, 1993, the soon-to-be-former president signed a clemency order freeing Aslam Adam from Butner federal prison in North Carolina. A Pakistani national, Adam had by then served eight years of a 55-year sentence for smuggling $1.5 million worth of heroin into the United States. He wouldn't have been eligible for parole for another two years. \n \n Stunning as the commutation of Adam's sentence was, even more bewildering was the lack of press interest or congressional concern about his case. It was mentioned in a single paragraph on an inside page of the Washington Post; the New York Times didn't cover it at all; and nobody except the Charlotte Observer asked why. There was no further investigation until 1994, when Eric Nadler examined the Adam matter for Rolling Stone. All that Nadler could establish for certain was that Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a stalwart friend of the Pakistani military regime and its domestic lobbyists, had interceded on Adam's behalf with the Justice Department and prison officials. \n . . . .\n",

You're the one who's trying to bring what \"Clinton did with his tool\" into this debate.\n \n\n \n No jyoshu, my original post was in response to the claim that the charges brought against Libby are:\n \nThis, along with the DeLay case are political prosecutions. Remember that the Grand Jury didn't return any indictments for the original investigation. The \"outing\" of the CIA Agent (I completely forgot her name, now. Shoot!) \n\n \n I pointed out that #1 this is not a political investigation, it's a criminal investigation, and it's based the real, factual events of both the outing of an uncercover operative, along with Libby giving contradictory information to what other sources are providing (lying). The fact that some democrats, or all of them, jump at the chance to slam the Bush administration is irrelevant.\n #2 The reason there were no charges into the outing of plame was because the trail of truth lead to Libby, who was lying, i.e. obstructing justice.\n \n So, I showed why both were false.\n \n Steeeeve then jumps in with:\n \n \nSo for the most part Libby has only been charged with what Clinton was charged with.\n\n \n you even chimed in earlier on the same topic:\n \n \nYou are wrong on this--it wasn't sexual activity that got Clinton in hot water--it was perjury, pere and simple. Perjury is perjury, no matter what the topic. the correct comparison is perjury and treason (which has yet to be determined), not sexual activity and treason.\n\n \n And while bringing up Clinton seems to be, in this case, Steeeeve's tactic, you seem content to also defend the red herring, that also happens to be nonsense.\n \n As you know, the invetigation has to do with investigating a crime. The nature of the crime they may or may not uncover is the reason there was questioning, it's why he lied, it's why it's obstruction of justice. It was not lying under oath that got Clinton in trouble, it was having sex and getting caught. Repeat it. It was comitting the act, that was BEING investigated. Without the act, nothing is being investigated. Without the act, nothing is being lied about. Trying to say a lie is a lie and therefore this is analgous to what happened to Clinton is absurd, and sad to see. You're an american, it's our government, not conservatives or democracts.\n \n Murder is not murder.\n If I kill someone trying to kill me, it's self defense and I did'nt commit a crime.\n \n Lying is not lying.\n I lie about people's appearance now and again, I have yet to see it in the law books that it's the same in every case.\n \n Stealing is not stealing.\n Depending on the value and nature of what is stolen, it can be a slap on the wrist, to significant jail time.\n \n Pressing a button is not pressing a button.\n I'm pressing buttons now and it makes no difference. Although if I pushed a button to detonate a nuke it would be a little different.\n \n So, the defense that \"purgery is purgery\", or that \"Clinton's crime of having sex\" is analagous to \"the alleged crime that Libby cooperated in a cover up of an act of treason for political gain\", is absurd.\n \n Both the underlying crimes are different, and thus the motivation for lying, the imapct to the american people, and the damage to others, is different.\n \n The sentence, as Howard detailed, as I remarked earlier, is based on the underlying crime, so one act of purgery can deemed worthy of quite a different punishment. Furthere, we are intelligent enough to know that the crime/alleged crimes being lied about are what we're after. Not just some mindless testimony to see if someone slips up and lies...lol. \n \n So, if you want to keep bringing up Clinton (irrelevant), and you want to keep preaching that \"A is A\", when we're talking about treason vs sex (A and B), then by all means, continue.\n \n It's just obvious that all three are incorrect (it's only political, it's not about treason since no one was yet charged with it, Clinton did the same thing). I agree, it's not worth disagreeing with these points, so please agree or ignore them.\n \n -Mach",

If one is impeached (and found guilty) then they can be charged in a \"regular court\" with the same crime to face criminal punishments.\nI agree. You can be charged as well with something. Anyone can be charged with anything. The fact is that Clinton was never charged in a judicial court of law with perjury or obstruction of justice. He never pled guilty to charges of obstruction or perjury. He wrote a letter acknowledging that his testimony may have been misleading and had his law license suspended for five years. If he had admitted perjury or obstruction he would have been disbarred which he was not. Clinton was charged and exonerated of obstruction in the Republican lead congress -- a very political body. Libby has been charged in a judicial criminal court and no one on either side of the isle is claiming that the charge is politically motivated. By the way Clinton was impeached and found not guilty of both obstruction and perjury. It may end up the same with Libby if he goes to trial and I think he should be given the same treatment as Clinton -- innocent until proven guilty or pleading guilty in a deal. But his position is much more precarious than Clinton's because there is little if any politics going on in Fitzgerald's office.",

   "JP:\n \n You keep spouting the same inaccuracy. I have already given you the Cornell Law School's definition and explanation of the impeachment process. Do you need Harvard and Duke's as well? The House brought a resolution of impeachment. \n\n Clinton was impeached by the House. What was inaccurate in that statement? emoticon_confused \n From the American Bar Association website:\n \n\n FAQs and Web Resources on the Impeachment Process \n \n Impeachment: A Look at the Process\n \n Q. What is impeachment? \n A. It is a process, authorized by the Constitution, to bring charges against certain officials of the federal government for misconduct while in office.\n \n Q. Who are these officials? \n A. Article 2, Section 4, specifies that \"The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" These \"civil officers\" include federal judges and cabinet members, but do not include Senators and Representatives, (the Senate and House deal with misconduct by their own members). \n \n Q. What is the role of the House of Representatives in impeachment under the Constitution? \n A. Article 1, Section 2, of the Constitution specifies that \"the House of Representatives...shall have the sole power of impeachment.\" This means that it has the power to bring charges against an official.  \n Q. What is the Senate's role under the Constitution? \n A. Once impeached, high officials are tried by the Senate. Article 1, Section 3, specifies, \"The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.\" \n \n Q. What punishment does the Constitution prescribe if the official is convicted? \n A. Article 1, Section 3, also specifies, \"Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States: but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.\" \n \n\n \n \n \n\n The senate denied it. The House resolution is similar to an indictment. The senate denial is similar to a not guilty verdict. Your need to distort demeans you.\n\n For someone that parses their words as carefully as you do, I'm surprised that you continuously misuse the term impeachment. Clinton was impeached; he as not removed from office by the Senate, however, because that required a 2/3 vote by the Senate and the Senate was split 50/50 and many senators believed that the punishment was too excessive given the nature of the crime. Where's the distortion in that? \n \n\n Really? Who are you, Carnack the Magnificent? You can tell what would happen. Richard Nixon resigned and his offense was not as serious for the national security as the underlying offense is for Libby.\n\n That's true. Republicans have chosen the more honorable \"resignation\" rather than having themselves drug through an impeachment or trial, unlike Clinton who had no class, so a public humiliating impeachment was no biggie to him. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Bottom line is you don't know what would happen. Nobody does. But is does reveal that the only basis for you erroneous rhetoric is your speculation and distortion..\n\n It's a reasonable assumption that a Republican Senate wouldn't vote to remove a Republican President (required 66 votes to remove) so soon after the Democratic Party failed to do the same with Clinton or do you think that Democrats have the partisanship moniker all to themselves? :)",

That investment field is biased toward captive US retirement funds such as the 401series of tax-deferred retirement contributions which allow trading commissions by managers and principles of those funds. With stagnated US wage growth well below real inflation levels making the lion's share of equity market contributions, we actually experience a decrease in capital expansion as evidenced by equity markets. \n \n A large portion of private US investment is directed at short-term transactional yields unaffiliated with industrial growth, IMO the true purpose behind recent tax cuts as those multiple transaction investments help drive GDP. That most substantial investment is being directed at domestic, non-industrial circumstances and foreign industrial capitalization seems evident by our (US) GDP when related to payment imbalance and trade deficits. \n \n I believe you're correct in pointing out government irresponsibility being partially financed by tax cuts. If I was China, India, etc., I'd certainly encourage modernizing my industrial and technical capabilities while expanding market share utilizing both US debt and US capital flight. To a point, it doesn't get much better than that, the only real issue being US ability to service debt with a declining value currency. \n \n While some posters refuse to blame any particular US administration for economic conditions, true from a long-term perspective, acceleration of debt by choice using military aggression while decreasing domestic societal well-being will not grant current US administration a favorable review in US economic history.

Highly polished GDP numbers structured to retain consumer confidence leaves two choices, the squirrel cage of expanding debt until it can no longer be serviced or a lowered standard of living. Without a much lower standard of living, our industrial capability has zero chance of recovery to dig us out of the eventual economic grave.",

   "While I wouldn't argue that the velocity of money is higher if the money is given to the average Joe, if the average Joe uses it to buy cheap off-shore goods, is that really advantageous to the overall economy?emoticon_frazzled emoticon_confused\n\n \n Not really. Of course, Americnas buying goods that are American produced is no especially good for the overall economy, either, since it does nto bring new wealth tot he nation. Exports bring new wealth tot he nation. \n \n that said, our economy and any percertion that it is anywhere near a desirable situation are based wholly on GDP numbers, the great adding machine with no subtraction ability. that being the case, and since nothign can really help pour economy now outside of a massive correction to the living standard of Americans and a complete reindustrialization of the US. Since that is not going to happen, we settle for pumping the GDP and keeping consumer confidence up. After all, if consumers are not spending, it is almost impossible for us to transfer their wealth to the pockets of wealthy Americans who NEED that wealth so in a few years when the whole house of cards comes tumbling down, they can afford to hire machine gun toting guards (not cheap considering the cost of machine guns) to protect their homes and assets from the unwashed masses.",

   "Ah jest reckon that if we gave everyone in the U.S. who made less than $25,000.00 annually a dollar an hour wage raise that would be a great big boost to the U.S. economy. Of course, we've got to have enough people in the U.S. employed in the U.S. to continue support of the economy, 'stead of outsourcing all of thos U.S. jobs.\n\n \n Print more money to buy more imported goods, increasing productivity and per-capita income in those 'other' countries, increasing US imbalance of payment, trade deficits and debt? Isn't that what we're now doing?\n \n Keeping manufacturing and professional jobs in the US is not in the cards with what Americans feel is their due within a global society.",

Your bodyguards are then covered by the Corporate NFA Class 3 license holder and can carry full auto $450 Uzis firing from an open bolt that cost civilians $6-7k. \n\n \n This is true, though I see certain advantages to hiring your own (namely cheap labor without the overhead involved).

Such things do not bode well for the future of the United States if guys like Cheney think that having an arsenal of automatic weapons is advantageous. A promineit politician recently built a \"country\" place not far from here. It has some fo the most interesting landscaping I have ever seen, complete with tank traps (or vehicle traps, as the case may be). The entire front \"yard\" is a series of interconnected berms with staggered cresecent shaped planters (in the army we called them \"machine gun nests\") at elevated positions in order to provide good field fo fire. The most interesting feature is a creeek that was diverted to flow around the property, complete with a retractable bridge.\n \n I will admit I had to stand and stare at the landscaping for a while trying to figure out where I had seen that exat configuration before. Finally it dawned on me, it was right out of the Armies defensive fortifications handbook.",

   "As you've seen by some posts in this thread, some Americans are naive, or stupid enough to consider indiscreet sexual activity on the same level as what amounts to treason. The inability to make a reasonable distinction between those two instances speaks volumes regarding values by our (US) public when motivated by dogma. \n \n The arrogance displayed by Scooter in attempting to 'punish' Wilson by exposing Wilson's wife as a covert agent and then lying about it to both the FBI and a grand jury is, to me, just another example of current administration's gross lack of concern for this country's welfare. When one combines that arrogance with the aforementioned public stupidity and reads posts attempting to rationalize an act of treason for whatever reason, those political values become not transparent as intended, but distorted.\n\n \n And some Americans were naive enough to believe Joe Wilson's lie. Crow is best served with a generous portion of whine to wash it down. :)",
