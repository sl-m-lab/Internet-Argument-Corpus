In other words a child is being abused if it is hurt in any way, physically or mentally. You can also say brainwashing children is a type of abuse.\n \n In this case i think the baby is too young to know if it was in danger or not, however if he did that to an older child, and that child was scared of the croc, then that Would be a form of abuse.\n \n Its like wacko jacko dangling his child over the edge of a balcony, it was more reckless than abusing.\n \n You have to asses why the child was put in danger and in this case i think it was just plain stupidity.",
