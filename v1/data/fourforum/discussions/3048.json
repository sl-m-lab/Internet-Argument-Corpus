   "In the past 30 years, 4 people that I went to school with, killed themselves. The one 19 year old guy was my great friend I grew up with, the one 24 year old guy was just a friend , the one 26 year old guy a classmate , and the one 20 year old gal was a classmate also. All of these young people were good people with kind souls, and all of us survivors are left with the same burning question, \"Why did you do it ?...\n \n Being raised with some religous upbringing, I was taught that suicide was one of the unforgivable sins, and one would be damned to hell for committing such an act. And the Ten Commandments supports that belief also of course, by proclaiming thou shalt not kill .... \n \n The 24 year guy according to the town buzz back then, was being sexually molested by his mother while raising him . This is where I run in to problems with the heaven /hell scenario. This guy was great in all ways, yet couldnt cope with life, greatly due to being raised in a incestous home, imo. How could a guy like that have his soul cooked on high in hell for eternity, for whackin' himself ?? \n \n Why doesnt the almighty powers intervene somehow, when they see a kind , yet troubled soul like my buddy , the same one that put his 12 gauge in his throat and pulled the trigger ??? Most suicides are not spontaneous , the victim has a tormented mind for some time , before they snap and end it all. It just looks like to me, these good souls could have used some divine intervention while they were in mental torment BEFORE , they ended it all. :(",

   "People will tell you all sorts of things about the dogma of their religions. None of it matters. Just ask yourself two questions. Do you think God is good? Would a good being consign your friends to hell? I hope the answers to those questions bring you some peace.\n\n \n Thanks for the reply Kronus, your veiwpoint brings some comfort to me . One side of me would like to take that answer in whole faith and be done with it , the other side of me says it may not be this simple. :) I worked in a hospital for 12 years , that had a behavioral health center on the 3rd floor of it. I was called to that floor many times to help restrain violent mental patients, so I got to see first hand , the power of the mind (and physical body ! ) when distorted.\n I often wondered just how could a loving God condemn these people , the ones that when they got out of the hospital and had the first chance, they took their own life. The all forgiving loving God, is the side of me I would like to believe, and as I see yours too, Kronus.... but ...\n \n The other side of me (and my religous background , small as it was) motivates me to think there is a strong reasoning for the Bibles teachings and warnings about self destruction and the state of the self terminated person's soul in the hereafter. Life can most assuredly be hard for some people, and for some as we see , totally unbearable , therfore they end it. I have often wondered sometimes when I think of my passed friends, what if NO one was EVER knowledgable of the Bible or teachings of Christianity ? How many thousands of people daily trudge through life everyday , pushing on, knowing they have to, because in their heart they know their life is God's , and not theirs to take at will?? They fight on, finally passing the obstacle that makes them want to quit life, but they DIDN'T quit , solely because of the fear for their own soul being lost, if they committed suicide . ...\n \n If one looks at the suicide rate in this country now, it is alarming. I wonder how many of those taking their own life today, grew up without any instruction on Christ , and had not even a single thought of any existence beyond the grave ? I dont know whether or not it made a difference to those successful suicide victims or not , that being, their belief in a afterlife or not... \n \n Twenty-seven years ago , I worked with a absolute great man named Bill, a man that was a professed Christian , and raising his family in a Christian home. He delivered lumber to our job sites daily , and was sent alone most of the time from the lumber yard. He had to carry the 4' x 8' sheets of 5/8 inch plywood by himself, sometimes a total of 75 of them , up two stories sometimes. We would help him sometimes if the builder wasnt around, but most of the time it was just Bill doing the mule work. Even with Bill being 55 years old, we never heard him complain or swear, just seen his red face and sweat soaked shirt , as he just went on about his work. \n \n One morning another driver delivered our lumber , so we asked about where Bill was, and the new driver's reply was , \" Didnt you hear ? Bill pulled over to the side of the road yesterday morning on the way to work , put a .38 in his mouth and pulled the trigger \" . THAT is really when my questioning about people ending their own lives began, and just what the judgement on their souls would be . As with most suicides, we never found out why Bill shot himself , we just concluded that with him having so little education, being 55 years old, and with no way out of the HARD physical labor, he was seeing the end of his capability of working and providing for his family was near, so he terminated his physical existence. I dunno..... \n \n I do know that all people have within them the capability of self destruction . I do know from my own life experiences around me, that people with depressive disorders are very subceptible to suicide. Even with todays marvels of medicine , they can sew up the brain, but cannot fix the mixed up signals it is putting out when a person is despondent, except maybe dull it with anti - depressants... \n \n I personally feel that a belief in Christ, and the hereafter, would seem to have a profound effect on a person having suicidal thoughts. The fear of not knowing what happens to the self terminated person's soul , would have to be a deterrent to suicide, it seems. But then again what do I know, it didnt deter my friend Bill, :(",

From what I gather reading your posts here, I see you are very knowledgable of the scripture , and are with spirit. If a person will read my posts in LadyWolf's thread on \"Is there a Hell ? \" they might get more of a take as to where I am coming from, on some of my religous questions on this forum..\n \n After seeing Monty's reply response below to this post, it prompts me to reply as to why I cannot grasp the whole heaven / hell scenario, in its presented state. I understand the saving of ones soul, by the way the Bible says it is. As I put in my \"Hell\" posts , I had the \"fruit of the spirit\" in me years ago, so I KNOW , the gift of it. But after on and off years of study , both in religous and paranormal events , I still cannot get the knashing of teeth and eternal fire scene of the hell place.\n \n My issue with salvation as given by the scripture is , as it states, once a person repents in their heart of sins, opens it up to Christ, believes in Him, and redeems themself , they are \"saved forever\", as you refer to in this post. As you stated above, we all in the physical body here on earth, and matters of spirituality cannot all be explained, by our carnal minds , and I concur. \n \n Where I have the major problem is, we all know and hear of death bed salvations. If that person at the door of physical death, fills the criteria of the above requirement for salvation, THEN they are truly saved from spiritual death . Right ?? Now , wherein lies the problem with that line of thinking , or truth, in my carnal mind anyway, :) . What if , at the last hour of their life on this earth, Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy REALLY and TRULY in their evil hearts , redeemed themselves ? If that redeemption was true, how much value does that put on a person living 75 years as a good, religous person , of whatever denomination chosen, and living a whole life as a \"saved\" person ? When on the other hand, a evil one that lived a life killing and tormenting humans, got \"saved\" at the last hour of their physical life on earth ?? I for one, surely do not want to share the same space in the afterworld with either one of them. .... \n \n Yes, I know, NOT a fair question for people living here on earth with only carnal intelligence derived from mans interpretation of the inspired Word, to base their beliefs in. I know of no one that has come back after death in this century, and told us about the known existence of the afterlife. So, my conjecture here is probaly not really worthy of the keyboard it was typed on. But, I do believe in a afterlife, (see my Mom's mattress post :) ) but I am not totally covinced about the placement of the souls in the hereafter , will fall as people believe. In my opinion , there are going to be a LOT of \"saved\" people that are going to be in for a real suprise when they cross over... \n \n After my \"Fruit of the Spirit\" life experience back in the early eighties, and I after I lost it of course, I studied a lot in to the afterlife/paranormal realm. The one common thread that ran through ALL facets of believers in the afterlife that was NOT based on religous beliefs was the following: Man has a soul, it is a spirit energy that lives on. The physical body is given a soul at the time of birth. This soul / life energy, is carried by the human physical body for that persons life span. The soul (spirit) is nutured and matures the same as the physical body. Whatever the level or \"state \" the soul has matured in to, at the time it is released from the deceased body, is what it will live in in the hereafter. ..\n \n That scenario , in my carnal mind renders to me more logic than most religous beliefs do. The very reason for Christ to come to this earth was for the salvation of mans soul, nothing to do about whether man would become a doctor or astronaut, or live a great and properous life here. It is the state of the persons heart , his actions here on earth toward his fellow man over his whole life time, that will dictate what level he will be at in the afterlife. Christ came to pull man to the \"light\" which elevates that soul to the highest level, one to where it will return back to , the same one it came from, God... \n \n I believe the souls in man that live in the dark side, evil ones, will have to graduate up the different levels , AFTER they pass over, not because of their redeemption at deaths door. To sum up, I believe that a mans soul will continue living the sum total of their life here on earth. So, with that logic, it renders TOTAL support to the fact that man needs to go to the Light of Christ , stay away from evil and temptations here on earth and let his soul be nutured by Christ, for the duration of their physical life, and that soul will get to go back to the source from where it came. And all of this is just MY opinion and belief people, not written or proven scientific facts, :)",

   "Hi Montalban:\n \n \nMontalban << By this reasoning, once you are 'saved', you can go out and kill people, because you're always saved. What an interesting doctrine you have there, Terral.\n\n \n And?? Is this where you begin presenting the opposing views? What does the term 'saved' mean in your bible? Let's examine what Paul tells the Ephesians.\n \n \n1. \"In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were sealed in Him  with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of {God's own} possession, to the praise of His glory.\" Eph. 1:13+14.\n\n \n \n2. \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" Eph. 2:8+9.\n\n \n \n3. \"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.\" Eph. 4:30.\n\n \n Exactly what does it mean to be 'sealed for the day of redemption?' Please provide us with Paul's example of someone becoming 'unsealed.' Next, let's consider some of Paul's first words to Timothy. It is a little longer, because I included the part about people like you, and those you support in the 'gay rights' threads . . . \n \n \n\"For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions. But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully, realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless  and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers and immoral men  and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else  is contrary to sound teaching, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted. I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service, even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief; and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are {found} in Christ Jesus. It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost {of all.} Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.\"1Tim. 1:6-16.\n\n \n Whether they are lawless, rebellious, ungodly sinners, unholy and profane, kill their fathers or mothers, murderers, immoral, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, blasphemers, persecutors or violent aggressors, Christ's shed blood is sufficient for them. Even when Christ was preaching the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23)) to Israel of the flesh (Matt. 10:5-7, 15:24), what did He say?\n \n \n\"But go and learn what this means: 'I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT SACRIFICE,' for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\" Matt. 9:13.\n \n \"And hearing {this,} Jesus *said to them, \"{It is} not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\" Matt. 2:17.\n \n \"I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.\" Luke 5:32.\n\n \n What do the Scriptures say?\n \n \n\"Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: \"BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED. \"BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOSE SIN THE LORD WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.\" Rom. 4:4-8 (OT quotes in CAPS; Psalms 32:1+2)\n\n \n David is writing about the covering of sins, and how blessed is the man whose sin the lord will not take into account. Exactly what sin did David commit? That's right, he was guilty of murder and adultery. Nathan convicted David, saying, \n\"Why have you despised the word of the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.\" 2Sam. 12:9.\n Then, of all the people in Scripture, Paul uses David as an example of how our sins are forgiven and how God credits righteousness. \n \n Do you know what? I may come out and speak against the 'gay rights' movement in this country, and some may get the impression that I am condemning all homosexuals to the fire and brimstone of the lake of fire. That simply is not so. If anyone hears and believes the good news that Christ came to die for sins, and that God raised Him on the third day, (1Cor. 15:1-4), then they are just as saved as anyone else. Those are my brothers and sisters 'in' Christ. Paul writes concerning all the saved, saying,\n \n \n\"But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly {places} in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.\" Eph. 2:4-7.\n\n \n He also writes, \n \n \n\"Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.\" Col. 3:1-4.\n\n \n Sealed in Him  by the Holy Spirit means SEALED indeed. Our lives being 'hidden with Christ in God,' means HIDDEN indeed. \n \n Please feel free to present a case for the life of someone in Christ becoming 'unhidden.' \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Well Montaban, it looks like according to the scriptures you are right . .. \n \n The way I understand the above post and scriptures by Teral, man can do whatever he wants on this earth to his fellow man, as long as sometime BEFORE he dies, he reaps salvation. No disrespect intended towards you Teral, but I respectfully disagree. Blanket salvation, with no regard to a lifetime of a mans actions here on earth, takes the very foundation of Christ's teachings, and tears the walls down. It basically states that NO matter what a persons does in this world, as long as that persons recieves salvation BEFORE his last breath is taken, he is exempt from any punishment, and will recieve all the grace the righteous will get... \n \n Wow, and then one wonders why non believers have such a hard time relating to religion, it is no wonder. Jesus taught peace , love, and good will toward man, teachings for all to live by, but yet , read the post above and whoa , there it is !!! A variance basically stating that , gezz, JUST in case you dont follow my teachings, and just happen to end up being a Jeff D. or Ted Bundy , cheat, liar, pervert, murderer , hey what the heck, I'll give you the free pass anyway, AFTER you reap salvation, and then you might even get a seat hidden in Christ, beside Mother Theresa. ... wow, \n \n This type of teachings can take the last bit of moral fiber out of people that are borderline suicidal, homicidal, or criminally minded , and let them cross the line to commit the atrocities they have been thinking about. After all they have that blanket salvation clause, that will cover them on their deathbed, right ??? . They have no moral or spiritual reason to worry about the damnation of their soul, they just found the \"ticket\" to rid themselves of that fear. :( \n \n My sincerest apologies to Teral, if I misinterpreted the post, and please enlighten me if am wrong. To me, this is really disturbing scripture that is posted , hopefully I am just reading it wrong and taking it out of context, and just making a molehill up to be a mountain , :)",

   "Hi Greg, Montalban and All:\n \n \nGreg << My issue with salvation as given by the scripture is , as it states, once a person repents in their heart of sins, opens it up to Christ, believes in Him, and redeems themself , they are \"saved forever\", as you refer to in this post. As you stated above, we all in the physical body here on earth, and matters of spirituality cannot all be explained, by our carnal minds , and I concur.\n\n \n None of your statements above are based in the Word of God. If you wish to discuss what the Bible says about salvation, then please post those verses and give us your commentary. For example, you have a problem with 'once a person repents.' Very good. No Greek word in any of the Pauline Epistles is translated into 'repent.' NASB. Receiving salvation is about hearing and believing the gospel; pure and simple. See my post on salvation:\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2574 \n \n Then see my post on the different gospel messages in your New Testament:\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2509 \n \n \nGreg << Where I have the major problem is, we all know and hear of death bed salvations. If that person at the door of physical death, fills the criteria of the above requirement for salvation, THEN they are truly saved from spiritual death . Right ?? \n \n \n No. Nobody can be truly saved by adhering to anything in your words above. However, anyone who hears and believes the gospel, even at the last second of life, is just as saved as anyone else. But, when we appear at the Judgment Seat of Christ (2Cor. 5:10), then what kind of rewards will that person receive? Yes, they will be one of the members of the 'body of Christ,' but while others have magnificent white garments and crowns with many jewels, the person in your example will have a cloudy garment with just a ring on his finger. The 'New Jerusalem' (Gal. 4:26) Administration has the appearance of a Pyramid with few members at the top, and many members at the bottom. The person you describe would occupy a position at the very bottom and do service to all the other members for the 'ages to come' (Eph. 2:7). So holding out to serve the flesh is a really bad idea for participation in a plan that continues for eternity. \n \n \nGreg << Now , wherein lies the problem with that line of thinking , or truth, in my carnal mind anyway, . What if , at the last hour of their life on this earth, Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy REALLY and TRULY in their evil hearts , redeemed themselves ?\n \n \n Absolutely. However, many professing Christians are totally ignorant to the 'mystery of iniquity (lawlessness).' 2Thes. 2:7. There is a 'mystery of Christ' (Eph. 3:4) and this mystery of lawlessness. As the body of Christ has members under Paul's stewardship (Eph. 3:2), then there are also souls baptized into the body of the antichrist. The 'deluding influence' (2Thes. 2:11) does not allow those members to see the truth, \"so as to be saved\" (2Thes. 2:10). So your examples above would not be likely to have the opportunity of accepting the gospel on their death bed. Just trust God that He knows what He is doing. This is His show.\n \n \nGreg << If that redeemption was true, how much value does that put on a person living 75 years as a good, religous person , of whatever denomination chosen, and living a whole life as a \"saved\" person ? When on the other hand, a evil one that lived a life killing and tormenting humans, got \"saved\" at the last hour of their physical life on earth ?? I for one, surely do not want to share the same space in the afterworld with either one of them. ....\n\n \n Your convictions appear to be justified, but they only fuel your unbelief. I see terrific holes in your theology. Perhaps it would be a good idea to worry about yourself first. Get back into Scripture and know exactly what God's Word has to say about all these things. I read the Pauline Epistles over one hundred times, before making my first post. Each time helps the spirit within build in stature. \n \n \nGreg << I believe the souls in man that live in the dark side, evil ones, will have to graduate up the different levels , AFTER they pass over, not because of their redeemption at deaths door.\n\n \n Way off. Many of the evil ones are seated in the heavenly places as we speak. Paul writes, \n \n \n\"Eph 6:11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual {forces} of wickedness in the heavenly {places.}\" Eph. 6:11+12.\n\n \n These evil forces came to power way back in Genesis 1:2. \n \n \n\"The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.\" Gen. 1:2.\n\n \n The 'light' of Genesis 1:3 (and John 1:4-9) is Christ. His plan is to replace a portion of those evil powers with members of the Body of Christ. That is what we are here for, and what Paul's gospel is all about. So this 'dark side,' 'evil ones' graduating level doctrine is based upon nothing in your Bible. Again, Paul says, \"making the most of your time, because the days are evil\" (Eph. 5:16), because of these evil powers that be. \n \n \nGreg to Montalban << The way I understand the above post and scriptures by Terral, man can do whatever he wants on this earth to his fellow man, as long as sometime BEFORE he dies, he reaps salvation. No disrespect intended towards you Terral, but I respectfully disagree. \n \n \n No problem here. I know about a thousand times more about Grace Doctrine, that you have had the opportunity to learn. No offence taken. Everyone here is allowed to disagree. What matters is what you can prove using Scripture. \n \n \nGreg << Blanket salvation, with no regard to a lifetime of a mans actions here on earth, takes the very foundation of Christ's teachings, and tears the walls down. It basically states that NO matter what a persons does in this world, as long as that persons recieves salvation BEFORE his last breath is taken, he is exempt from any punishment, and will recieve all the grace the righteous will get...\n \n \n That is the power of the grace of God. What does Scripture say? \n \n \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.\" Eph. 2:8-10.\n \n What can you add to the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross to make His sacrifice for sin more perfect? Do you really believe that a person can commit a sin that Christ's shed blood cannot cover? \n \n \n\"In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace which He lavished on us.\" Eph. 1:7+8a.\n\n \n Everyone reading these words would do well to take notice. The work that God is doing in men today, and the Gentile 'church' currently upon this earth, is part of a plan to teach something to all the heavenly authorities throughout ages to come. Paul writes about us, saying, \n \n \n\"To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery  which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things; so that the manifold wisdom of God  might now be made known through the church  to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" Eph. 3:8-11.\n\n \n And you are worried about rubbing shoulders with someone less deserving than yourself in your heavenly experience? And, must pardon yourself for blasting God, over His mercy given freely to others who might have greater sin than yourself? \n \n \nGreg << Wow, and then one wonders why non believers have such a hard time relating to religion, it is no wonder. Jesus taught peace , love, and good will toward man, teachings for all to live by, but yet , read the post above and whoa , there it is !!! A variance basically stating that , gezz, JUST in case you dont follow my teachings, and just happen to end up being a Jeff D. or Ted Bundy , cheat, liar, pervert, murderer , hey what the heck, I'll give you the free pass anyway, AFTER you reap salvation, and then you might even get a seat hidden in Christ, beside Mother Theresa. ... wow,\n \n \n What does Scripture say?\n \n \n\"For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts, and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin {as} instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members {as} instruments of righteousness to God. For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace. What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!\" Rom. 6:10-15.\n\n \n Paul also had to answer the critics about the freedom He had through Grace Doctrine. Shall we sin, because we are under grace? May it never be! Before salvation the cycle of sin remains constant in the natural man's life. A true member of the body of Christ does not follow the Spirit out of fear and trembling, like a practicing Jew does the Law. We seek the things above, where Christ is BECAUSE we are forgiven, and because we are eternally grateful to our Father in heaven. \n \n He is put His Spirit in our mortal bodies, which gives us the strength to say 'No' to the flesh. How are we going to thank Him? Through the flesh? No. The regenerated man has that choice, and throughout his life will grow stronger 'in' Christ, if he will continue to feed upon His Word. Many among the denominations will never get it, because they have yet to experience the power of God's grace first hand. They practice the same rituals over and over again, and live under the persuasion of the 'deluding influence' that has them chained to their religion. \n \n The only way to break that spell is to follow the same footsteps of every soul who has heard and believed the Gospel; head straight to Calvary. Come to realize that if you were the only person living on this planet in need of a Savior, then He would still come and die for you. The thing you should be asking yourself, \" Is His blood sufficient for me? \" If you must add water baptism to Christ's shed blood, to make it good enough, then His blood is not sufficient for you. If you must add a single work to Christ's sacrifice for your redemption, then His blood is just not good enough for your justification before God. God has made the provision for all men to be saved. Men say 'No' by trying to add things to Christ's FINISHED work at Calvary. \n \n However, if you can stand at the foot of the cross and look up at Him, and say, \"Yes, God, your Son's blood is sufficient to cover my sins, and the sins of the whole world!,\" then the deluding influence will lose his power over you. The blindness of 2Cor. 4:3+4 will fall from your eyes like scales. And suddenly you also will be baptized into His body (1Cor. 12:13) on the cross, and you will die the very moment He died (Rom. 6:3). You will be laid with Him in the tomb and be there three days. And then, when God raises Christ from the dead (Rom. 6:4), then you will be raised with Him (Eph. 1:20); 'in' Him. Only then will you be seated 'in' Christ in the heavenly places (Eph. 2:4-7). And from that day forward, when God Almighty looks at you, He will see His Only Beloved Son, because you have been 'clothed with Christ.' Gal. 3:27. \n \n \nGreg << My sincerest apologies to Terral, if I misinterpreted the post, and please enlighten me if am wrong. To me, this is really disturbing scripture that is posted , hopefully I am just reading it wrong and taking it out of context, and just making a molehill up to be a mountain.\n\n \n No, that is quite okay, Greg. Your post has given me another opportunity to share the gospel. Read the posts I gave you above and read from the Pauline Epistles every day. Then allow some time for these seeds to take root, shoots to grow, then the harvest. That is God's way of insuring that only His children know Him through His Word.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Hi Greg and Montalban:\n \n \nMontalban << Terral is all about taking verses out of context. He did this with quoting one verse from 1 Cor 11, in order to disprove the Eucharist, but when I pointed out he should read to verse 29, he'd find 'the key' to the text.\n\n \n Who is building a case for man-made rituals out of one chapter of 1Corinthians; by far the most fleshy (1Cor. 3:1-3) bunch in the entire New Testament? Your Holy Eucharist thread contains many arguments against bread and wine rituals. Paul even says, \n \n \n\"Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:20. \n \n \n So what does Montalban do? He changes the 'Lord's Supper' into 'Love Feast.' Then says, \"Hey, Paul really means 'not' to do that! How amazing. These people have taken a ritual supper that Christ did once a year, according to Mosaic Law (Lev. 23:5), and turned into a sacrificial ritual where they sacrifice Christ over and over and over and over again. They 'really' believe that those little chucks of bread is 'really' the 'body of Christ.' Even when Paul tells us over and over that the 'church' is the body of Christ. Rom. 12:4+5, 1Cor. 12:12-27, Eph. 4:12, 5:30, etc.. He says,\n \n \"Col 1:24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions.\"\n \n Head over here and see if my case is built upon one verse of Scripture, or if this guy is a liar. \n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2934&page=2&pp=15\n \n Did you realize that this word \"Eucharist\" is derived from a Greek word that means 'thanks?' Eucharisteo (2168; verb). That word is only used twice in the entire Gospel of Matthew (Matt. 15:36, 26:27). Christ merely gave 'thanks.' The noun form of this word does not appear anywhere in the entire account! From that these people have invented The Holy Eucharist Communion Sacrificial Meal. And then, this guy has the gall to come out here and say I am taking verses out of context?! \n \n My post to you above had 2,292 words. Did Mr. Montalban cut and paste one of them in an attempt at refuting one statement? No. Instead, he cuts your whole post and complains to you about how I take things out of context without proving anything. \n \n Mr. Montalban owes us seven posts in the doctrine section on the Seven Holy Sacraments of his Orthodox Church. If they are so sacred, why doesn't he just come out and present them? He has no time for that, but plenty to spend in support of the homosexuals on this site. Then tells me I give Orthodox Christians a bad name by standing up to their foolishness. Well, they make perfect bed partners if you ask me. God will judge over every one of these words. Everyone professing to be Christian does not belong to our Father. The purpose of these debates is so that each person can determine for themselves who is approved and who is not. As it is written,\n \n \n\"For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you. Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.\" 1Cor. 11:19+20.\n\n \n Paul warns, \n \n \"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but {wanting} to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.\" 2Tim. 4:3+4.\n \n So keep your eyes pealed and God's Word open; check things out for yourself. I am going to be offline for a while now; moving to North Florida. But the resources are here on this site, and in your Bible for 'the' truth to be known. GL, and,\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Yes sir guys, what Teral said is a fact , I dont know a spot on a molecule's hinny, compared to what some of the folks on here do about matters of religion. I will be the first to admit to that honestly though, and without reservation... But I am 52 years old now, and have had some experience dabbling around in life , and one of the most confusing parts of it has been whenever I try to get a handle on religion , especially western hemisphere Christianity...\n \n As I have stated many times before, I believe in Christ, His works and His promises, solely because of my personal experiences, not because of what a TV preacher said , a church preacher, or anyone on a BBS has said. I guess the most confusing part is the interpretation of the scriptures. And, what a man does when he has totally convinced himself , or his church convinces him that the way they are teaching/learning and interpreting the scripture, using whatever translated version of the Book they have, IS the RIGHT one, and the ONLY right one....\n \n Case in point , when I was a senior in high school, I had a good friend I run around a lot with , from 1966 to 1970 . My buddy's dad was VERY religous , allowed NO tv or telephones in the home , was a church goer 3 to 5 times a week. I was at my buddy's house often , and would cross path's with his dad , but I would make it a short path, because honestly , the man scared me. He had that constant scowl on his face, with those deep , set back in the socket type eyes, that just gave me the willies. One night my buddy and I were sitting in his 1950 Ford at the local drive-in , eating burgers and fries and just jawing about anything and everything , the way teens did back then.\n \n As conversations go, sometimes one comment will open the door for a person to just suddenly \"spill forth\" with something to say, that may be heavy on their mind. I dont remember what I said, but all of a sudden my buddy started telling me something that burned a image in my mind, one I have not forgotten in over 34 years now. He started speaking of his dad and how religous he was, and how strict he was on him and his brothers at home. I told him, \" Aw man, thats a good thing, you wont grow up to be a heathen\", and chuckled, then I stopped chuckling because I saw he was being real serious. So, I listened quietly while he told me just how strict his Dad was, and how his dad ran the home and family, by the strict letter of the Bible and the scripture in it....\n \n He told me of the one incident of his dad's disipline, that had really haunted him since he was ten years old. He said that late one evening his oldest brother and his dad had got it to a spat at the dinner table, something about the calf's not being fed, or something of that nature. The offending older brother was told by his dad to go to the barn, and stay there. My buddy just ten years old at the time, waited a bit and snuck up to the barn and peeped in thru the barn door cracks to see what they were up to , as kids will do....\n \n My buddy said what he saw was his brother, bare backed with his chest pressed against a bent pole , and his hands were tied together behind the big support post. His Dad was screaming at him some verses of scripture out of the Bible, something about he would NOT spare the rod , and was lashing his brothers back with harness reins, the ones that had the steel mouth bits in them. My buddy said just as the gashes opened up on his brothers back , and the blood poured out, it was then his dad reached down, scraped some salt off the top of a salt lick block, and tossed it into his brothers gashes...\n \n \n Sorry, not a nice story , but a true one. One that proves my point on interpretation, and the way that mortal people reading scripture can make it read the way they want it to read. I know that scripture is inspired, but it has been translated by mere mortals, men that did not have the comprehension it took to understand the fact that when words are taken out of context, or not placed in a literary form of feasible comprehension, they can mistakenly be used for as much evil , as they can good. I am sure we can all tell stories of where humans have been abused because of overly zealous religous people using misinterpreted scripture. Sorry, not really a breaking news story here, and all jmo",

This side is getting a bit put off by people complaining about how I take things out of context and use Scripture incorrectly. That is all fine and dandy. So show me . . . \"Cut and Paste\" anything I have written and show how I took that out of context, just once . . . At some point the whining needs to end. Either put up, or shut up. I am easily quoting more Scripture on this forum than everyone else combined, by far. How many have stood up to the plate and challenged me to the point that I had to remove one verse? Nobody. If one of you were doing so, then at least I would be learning something, along with everyone else.\n \n This space should be used for posting information about the topic; not wasted on peanut gallery antics.\n \n GL,\n \n Terral",

I said I was done posting on this thread, but will reply , since you referred to me in this post. I am not really dealing with any demons in my life, least not those, (referring to my friends that committed suicide,) so be at peace about that one... As much as I tried to get a sound reference from my Bible on that matter, I could not , except the verse that spoke of Judas hanging himself, and it ended as fast as his life. So , I came here in hope of a solid answer from people with a lot more knowledge of scripture than I . I must say I was not enlightened by the answers I read, and the scriptures Teral posted about judgement , troubled me even more so. ..\n \n The whole scenario of a book being opened with names in it, and the knowing of EVERY persons soul and their works in their physical life , with blanket salvation for murderers, with judgements passed on those that died NOT REALLY knowing what in the heck they really believed, and all of those souls have to be put in either a heaven or hell, is incomprehensible to me. Just for a example, what will happen to a 13 year old boy's soul , that while being raised by atheists, had not gotten ANY knowledge of the WORD of Christ, and suddenly dies in a car crash ? ... \n \n Yes, he was old enough to know his religous convictions, but was raised in a family that did not hold to that enigma , so he was not exposed to Christianity. So, does that childs soul burn , then destroyed ??? Is that the understanding we are to get from Christ ? I do not think HE taught that, and would be a surprise to me if HE did. If all of the millions, upon millions , upon millions, of souls that have left this world , ever since man has existed, and WITH all of those souls having different idealogies, different faiths, with known records of their works done by them while they were living attached to them at the judgement, could they all be catagorized and labeled as simple as this ?? .... \" O.K. this soul goes UP , yep, Greg he goes UP, WHOA! hold on a minute, I see here he was on a BBS questioning the BOSS, so he goes DOWN now, wait a minute, this Bill guy he was on the UP list back when he was in his twenties, but now he goes DOWN, .. :) \n \n Why was man given a free will, with a mind to think, a heart to search and a brain to imagine and explore life, if the end result is , that man has to follow these EXACT rules and spiritual guidelines and cannot deviate from them ?? I understand the casting out of the angel to later be called Satan , and that good and evil both exist here on earth. I believe the Ten Commandents give us all the necessary rules to stay away from evil. SO , with that basic understanding, why is it neccessary to have all the other writings to live by , that make life and death, so confusing ?? .... \n \n And , if the scenario listed above happens EXACTLY as it says it is, I look for heaven to have a \"vacancy\" sign out, and hell to have a \" standing room only\" scrolling neon sign over its door, and a lot of self righteous people holding their destination voucher and reading it with their jaws dropped down and exclaiming , \" Whatha *&%## !! , I aint supposed to go THERE !!!!! :)",

He, being God (we must constantly remind ourselves), could have simply forgiven mankind with a word if he wished, but chose instead to crucify himself. It simply did not have to be this way, IMO. He had the opportunity to defend himself at his trial. Luke 23:9 states many questions were asked by Herod but Jesus chose silence each time. If Herod had handed him a gun at that moment, what are we to believe he would do with it? Doesn't it become clearer that his life was in his own hands? Believers may not wish to hear this and take extreme umbrage with me, or think I'm missing the big picture, but it's suicide no matter how we look upon it.\n \n If it's okay with Jesus, it must not be the unpardonable sin Thomas Aquinas said it was. I don't condone the practice, and think it's never the right answer, but for the survivors to have to wrestle with the possibility that the deceased is now really in big trouble only increases the burden they already carry. My only wish in contributing here is to allay that load. \n \n I'm glad to hear you've come to grips with this matter. I must say I find your writing to be an honest searching for truth, and hope you continue to look for it, no matter where you may find it.",

I must say I find your writing to be an honest searching for truth, and hope you continue to look for it, no matter where you may find it.\n\n \n There's different ways of taking one's life. There's the Islamic 'martyr', there's the Christian 'self-sacrifice', and then there's suicide (There may be other categories - I don't know - there's accidental death, but I don't think that falls into this discussion)\n \n The Suicide is one who kills him/herself in an act of despair.\n \n The Martyr in the Muslim sense is someone who kills him/herself and many others, for a particular politico-religious reason.\n \n The Self-Sacrifice is giving one's own life, for another person. Of the three, only this one is a truly self-less task. If you might recall the clich\u00e9d war film where some enemy throws a grenade into a trench and someone dives over it, to take it's full impact and protect the life of his buddies. That is self-sacrifice - giving one's own life to the aid of others. It is the term 'martyr used to be applied to, until Muslims started strapping bombs to themselves. Martyr in this sense vastly differs from the Christian concept in which the Christian martyr doesn't kill others in the process of self-sacrifice.",
