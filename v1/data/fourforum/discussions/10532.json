But when Sunni's kill Sheites or Sheites kill Sunni's it's always planned mass murder on the largest scale possible.

You cannot, because it just isn't factual to imply that at all. And that assertion I can prove. Here's an excerpt and a link:\n \n http://www.americanthinker.com/2007/10/is_iraq_more_peaceful_now_than.html \n After reviewing the number of civilians found in Saddam's mass graves, which were still being discovered in 2005, I'm not so sure. If we're talking about only civilians and political prisoners, the toll for Saddam's 23 years in power was at least 300,000 people murdered; that's 13,043 per year; 1,086 per month; or 36 per day. \n \n At that rate, if AFP's estimate is the correct one, for an Iraqi civilian, it's safer to be in the middle of a hot war under American rule today, than \"at peace\" under Saddam. And of course, Saddam's 300,000 political murders are a number apart from the 500,000 or so Iraqi soldiers he sent to their deaths in his bizarre invasions of Iran and Kuwait. And the hundreds or thousands of murders around the world that he caused as a financier of terrorism.\n \n I've heard from so many sober voices that launching the Iraq war was a terrible thing to do: from the loony-Left of MoveOn.org, the plain-vanilla Left of television and news magazines, the quaint Left represented by certain Vatican spokesmen, and the triumphant gloom of the far Right. No doubt it feels righteous to protest a war, since wars involve so much unjust killing. \n \n But what about Saddam's war, which was waged every day and in all directions? Were the lives he mercilessly took without significance? Are the lives Saddam would have taken, if not for America's intervention, without value? \n \n Moralists and politicians should remember that there are many kinds of violence. One of them is failing to defend the innocent.\n \nWere the majority of those deaths the result of muslim on muslim violence? What evidence do you have for that? IED's, roadside bombs and beheadings will be the iraqis, but gunshots (of which there are more than those other 3 put together) are at least as likely to be the coalition. In most cases, the perpetrator was unknown. In cases where the perpetrator was known, it was in the majority of cases the coalition - according to the lancet study.\n\n \n I maintain without question that for every FIFTY iraqi civilians being killed in this War since its end and the Terrorists started their aggression to destabilize the new Government and to cause a Civil War so our goal to build a FREE and INDEPENDENT Iraq will fail, only ONE was killed by us. And a 50 to 1 ratio is an acceptable collateral loss considering we are in an actual War with a radical enemy who struck us first and has vowed to destroy us no matter what lengths we take to make peace with them.\n \n Feel free to lay out a peace plan you think they would accept considering they have signed religious fatwas vowing to either force our conversion to allah or to cut our heads off. The choice to live will be ours. Either submit or die, and given that choice, I choose to fight to the death. And oh, since you're new here, you should know that I was born a moslem so I know how serious these radicals are. You can surrender to evil incarnate if you like, but I refuse to. Ali...",

I know you think you are at war with all Muslims everywhere, but that's not how international law works.\n\n \n Isn't it interesting that you didn't see fit to post a link supporting your allegation that coalition forces are responsible for 60% of civilian deaths either. The reality is that it's impossible to get accurate numbers since when we attack an area and focus our efforts on JUST the Insurgents who are hiding out in neighborhoods, the Insurgents will indiscriminately kill as many innocent civilians as needed for cover to allow their escape. This is their standard operating procedure, and we are then blamed by the propagandists for the deaths of those innocents even though we didn't kill them.\n \n Also, consider that our forces regularily come against insurgents who are cornered in a house or neighborhood conclave, and when we blow them up as a result of a full blown battle, we find dead women and children in the aftermath. Do you blame us for those deaths for fighting an aggressive enemy that fired on us from those positions ? Or do you blame the insugents for being such cowards that they would use women and children as human shields knowing they could later label the coalition as the killers of innocent civilians ? I know, you blame us because you lack any sense of justice or right and wrong. And you also show that you have no perception of the realities of War or the Islamic Propaganda Machine either. Here is some more info that at least attempts to be objective.\n \n http://washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2523\n How Are They Dying? \n \n Iraqis are being killed in a variety of ways, from individual throat cutting to largely indiscriminate suicide bombing. The paper provides rough categories of causes of death, but these are poorly defined and make analysis difficult. Given the effects of modern weapons on human bodies, it may have been difficult in some cases for survey respondents to clearly distinguish among causes of death. \n \n The paper points to gunshot wounds as the primary cause of violent death without clearly defining what falls into this category, and further suggests a connection with executions, assassinations, and the coalition targeting of military-age males. These explanations hardly account for the numbers killed as estimated by the study. If some 600,000 Iraqis died violently and 56 percent of those deaths were from gunshot wounds, that would amount to some 336,000 Iraqis killed by gunshot. If the coalition caused 31 percent of gunshot-related deaths, that would mean that coalition forces have gunned down some 104,160 Iraqis, or approximately 87 per day for more than 1,200 days. On the face of it, those figures are simply not credible. There were periods in which significant numbers of Sunni insurgents and Mahdi Army members were killed, including the second battle of Falluja and the April and August 2004 clashes with the Mahdi Army, but fighting at that intensity has been rare. Similarly, the data suggests that Iraqis have killed more than 231,000 other Iraqis by gunshot, or approximately 193 per day. These figures also do not seem credible. \n \n A similarly vague category is \"other explosion/ordnance.\" This appears to refer to explosions other than car bombings, but the term \"ordnance\" is so broad that it precludes any meaningful interpretation. It could include all types of heavy weapons such as vehicle-mounted cannons, mortars, artillery rockets, and so on. The relatively small number of casualties (14 percent) inflicted by these weapons, as indicated in the survey data, suggests that coalition forces, which have a preponderance of heavy weapons, are not using them indiscriminately-a finding that would have been useful to report. \n \n Airstrikes are the only category that can be clearly attributed to coalition forces, but even here there is room for ambiguity. Iraqis have on occasion described incidents involving improvised explosive devices (IEDs), mortar fire, and artillery rocket fire as airstrikes and blamed them on the coalition. The relatively small percentage of Iraqis (13 percent) reportedly killed in airstrikes suggests that the coalition is also not employing airpower indiscriminately, and the study itself suggests that such incidents are causing a declining percentage of violent deaths. \n \n Where Are They Dying? \n \n Overall, the study finds high levels of violent deaths where they would be expected-in the Sunni provinces and the mixed province of Diyala. The study concludes that the highest level of violent deaths-more than 10 per 1,000 residents per year-are in the Nineveh, Salah al-Din, Anbar, and Diyala provinces. Surprisingly, Baghdad does not fall into the most violent category according to the survey results. The study points to other provinces as areas of substantial violence (2 to 10 violent deaths per 1,000 per year). These include Tamim, home to the increasingly violent city of Kirkuk, and Basra and several other Shiite provinces in the south, where a m\u00c3\u00a9lange of Shiite groups are fighting for power and occasionally engaging coalition forces. In this regard, the paper does not support coalition statements that most of Iraq is relatively free of violence. \n \n Methodological Questions \n \n A serious scientific effort must be as transparent as possible in its methodologies and empirical results. Further evaluation of this study would benefit from additional clarity and detail concerning the actual sample data and the mathematical analyses used to arrive at the statistical results. Examples of methodological issues include the following. \n \n First, the study compares results from three fourteen-month periods after the invasion to results from only one fourteen-month period before the invasion-and that period is the one immediately preceding the invasion, when the Iraqi regime was preparing for war. How representative of violent activity in Iraq is that one preinvasion period? Would looking at three periods before the invasion improve the study's credibility? Second, only two violent deaths were reported in the survey data during the fourteen months prior to the invasion. This seems questionable considering the regime's prewar security operations and the low-level insurgency being waged in the south. Is this very low baseline of violence, in a regime known for violent activity, plausible? Third, it would be useful to know more about how representative the study's random sampling process was. Where were the clusters of surveyed households located, and what were the actual numerical results for each cluster? If violent deaths are positively correlated with population density, would random selection of cluster locations proportionate to population size cause an upward statistical bias in the results (when projected over the country as a whole)? Finally, no mention is made of public access to the body of data collected. Public access would allow other experts to attempt replication of the results-a critical requirement for scientific credibility. \n \n Conclusion \n \n Overall, the study demonstrates that the conflict in Iraq touches broad sectors of the population, that violence is a problem in large parts of the country, and that the level of violence is increasing. The study's methodological problems may not be trivial. The fact that the study does not better analyze and define the agents behind the increased violence raises concerns about its credibility, as do several tendentious and nearly polemical statements in the body of the article. For example, to argue that Iraq is \"the deadliest international conflict of the 21st century\" is not saying much-the century is only six years old, and if one looks back 100 years, Iraq does not look like a major conflict. \n \n In war, people die-often in large numbers. And in twentieth-century warfare, the percentage of civilians dying increased. War is no longer fought away from population centers, if it ever was. In Iraq the war is being fought within population centers, and civilians are routinely involved in the fighting. There is no easy way to separate the combatants from the population. Both Sunni insurgents and Shiite militia emerge from the cover of the populace, conduct their actions, and fade back among civilians. Militias use the Iraqi police as a cover for death-squad actions. In many cases the Iraqi populace supports, willingly or unwillingly, the armed elements operating from within it. The death of Iraqis is not a byproduct of an international conflict in which they are only tangentially involved. Iraqis are intimately and intrinsically participating in the conflict. Not all of them, of course, but a great many Iraqis are the gunmen, the bombers, the expediters, the militia leaders, and the support base for these active agents in the war. The notion that the coalition is the primary driver of violence is no longer correct. The war in Iraq is an increasingly Iraqi war, and one that the various Iraqi constituencies can halt should they choose to. \n \n Jeffrey White is The Washington Institute's Berrie defense fellow, specializing in the military and security affairs of Iraq and the Levant.

   "Since the Iraqi people know that we are there to free them from Islamofascism and not dominate and oppress them.\n\n \n But they don't and neither do I. A gallup poll that most iraqis believe that the coalition is there to plunder their natural resources. I agree, as does greenspan - a republican and the man in charge of the US economy when the invasion happened. It is important to look at the record of the US government in dealing with iraq before taking its claims at face value. Before the gulf war, the US backed sadam to the hilt through his worst attrocities. After the gulf war, they intervened to prevent a widespread revolt from getting weapons - ensureing that the revolutionaries were slaughtered and sadam remained in power. \n http://www.medialens.org/alerts/07/071010_oil_laws_colonising.php\n \n \nCan you prove that more people are dying now than under saddam ? and that it is Americans who are killing them ?\n \n \n I can most certainly prove that more are dying now than under sadam. Sadam's regime was nasty, but not to the extent of the rwandan genocide. Why should I have to prove that its americans who are directly killing them. My point is that the deaths are the result of the invasion. I don't follow liberal ethics, where causing death is ok if its done indirectly. Especially seeing as how you liberals hypocritically jump at the chance to blame official enemies for the indirect deaths they cause (ie famines in the USSR). I think in terms of cause and effect. CAUSE: Coalition invasion of iraq, which destroyed law and order. EFFECT: Massive deaths due to sectarian violence, and coalition killings.\n \n I fight to defend the innocent by fighting the coalition. I believe pacifist tactics to be the most effective.\n \n You maintain the 50:1 ratio \"without question\"? Does that mean you cant defend it? I trust the worlds top medical journal more than a pro-war think tank.\n \n \nThe choice to live will be ours. Either submit or die, and given that choice, I choose to fight to the death. And oh, since you're new here, you should know that I was born a moslem so I know how serious these radicals are. You can surrender to evil incarnate if you like, but I refuse to. Ali... \n\n \n Evil incarnate... Let me guess, you also get your conception of evil from religion. It is ridiculous, bordering on paranoid delusion, to suggest that those living in the USA are engaged in a fight to the death. America has the best weapons over 50% of the worlds military spending can buy. AlQaida has kalachinakovs and stones. You aren't in danger of being conquered.\n \n Also, on this point I will make clear that the invasion of iraq has been beneficial, not detrimental to alqaida (I assume this is who you are refering to as \"evil incarnate\"). AlQaida and Sadam were great enemies - the latter wanting to overthrow Sadam for being too secular. Before the war, alquaida had almost no presence in iraq, now it has quite a large one. Support for alquaida, and hatred of america amongst muslims has been greatly increased by the slaughter of their brethren. \n \n For a peace plan I recomend that people fight to make the coalition adopt a non-interventionist foreign policy. This is pragmatism based on the lessons of history, and an understanding that western interventions have been overwhelmingly negative. To suggest that the west should charge in to sort out the affairs of people they are not democratically accountable to is idealism at the barrel of a gun remeniscent of the bolsheviks - and produces similar practical results.\n \n Finally, there is another war going on. The war between international capital (with western governments as its mercenary thugs) and the majority of the human race. The agressor here is far more powerful and dangerous that islamicism and has killed far, far more. Here I stand with most of the human race. I'm not a coward, I'm just not on your side.\n \n For an intro to this other, and much more deadly war, here is a good place to start:\n http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/sam/sam-contents.html",

   "If we are trying to plunder Iraq's resources, then why is their Oil still being sold on the World Market\n\n \n Because its known that western corporations have the most money, so will be the ones who buy it. Thats how neoliberal plunder works. The proper solution would be to have the oil nationalised, so the profits go to the iraqi people. Instead, it will be sold, for far less than the expected profits from it - and the profits will go to the western corporations who will inevitably buy it. \n \n The american ruling class doesnt care about things like gas prices. Control of Iraqs natural resources wont significantly benefit the US general population - only a tiny minority elite. And the point is more that they keep Iraqs oil out of the hands of china/the emerging economies - to ensure the US stays economically dominant - than to have it for themselves (of course they will have it as well).\n \n \nYeah, you keep claiming that. Unfortunately you don't post any evidence because you can't.\n\n \n No? What about the ORB study claiming more deaths than the Rwandan Genocide? You know, the first thing I posted? Remember, I consider indirect deaths as well - as everyone does when assesing th crimes of official US enemies.\n \n \nYou are defending no one except the Terrorists who love to read the drivel you post and take great pleasure that their are Americans who are ignorant enough to believe the cr#p you believe. \n\n \n And you are defending no one but the imperialist swine who laugh all the way to the bank as Iraq is destroyed. Assertions get us so far.\n \n Whats your point E Mutz? If there had been no invasion, those terrorist attacks you cite would not be happening.",

Remember, I consider indirect deaths as well - as everyone does when assesing the crimes of official US enemies.\n \n Uh, yeah....About this everyone else....thing. Argumentum ad populum. You are free to consider whatever wild-XXX idea you will but ye cannot claim universal backing without fallacious reasoning. But then, why break with the pattern now. Ye might just as well blame the farmer for the weeds that grow in his crop. If he hadn't farmed he wouldn't have weeds. \n \n The american ruling class doesnt care about things like gas prices.

China is cranking out 3.6 Billion barrels of oil/day without Iraq and without the environmental restrictions enjoyed by US oil. Half of America's \"ruling class\" just got tossed out on it's XXX because of disatisfaction with the war, economy and gas prices. \n \n And you are defending no one but the imperialist swine who laugh all the way to the bank as Iraq is destroyed.

I don't see how.\n \n \n[Nevertheless, do you assume that the terroism against civilians will simply vanish once these conquering US hordes depart?\n\n \n No, its too late for that. But it would very likely be strongly reduced, once a state of affairs the Iraqi population does not desire is no longer being imposed on it. The Shia majority, who the current regime supresses, would crush AlQuaida for a start.\n \n \nOh no, I forgot. US is responsible for that too. Got it.\n\n \n Well, according to international law, the US is responsible - the crime of agression (the 2003 invasion) \"contains within itself responisibility for all that follows\".\n \n But I don't have liberal morals, or think in terms of 'responsiblity', I think in terms of cause and effect. CAUSE: Invasion destroys law and order. EFFECT: Sectarian violence. \n \n \nOil was nationalized under Sadam. Had been since 1972. He built palaces with the money. That's how socialism works.\n\n \n Surely thats because sadam was an evil chappie, no? It does not discredit nationalisation - how a government uses its money depends on the government, no? If you want to claim that the current iraqi government is just like sadam, I wont stop you.\n However brutal sadams regime was, it offered the iraqi people ok welfare before the sanctions. This isn't on the cards with the new regime.\n \n \nUh, yeah....About this everyone else....thing.\n\n \n Ok *virtually* everyone else.

   "The beauty of rapacious capitalism (laissez faire) is that once you control the government you have the whole resources of the country to foster their goals. \n I agree with Rudyrocker Iraq hasn't been plundered yet but just wait .. please read below:\n \n \n \n Iraq has the world's second largest proven oil reserves. According to oil industry experts, new exploration will probably raise Iraq's reserves to 200+ billion barrels of high-grade crude, extraordinarily cheap to produce. The four giant firms located in the US and the UK have been keen to get back into Iraq, from which they were excluded with the nationalization of 1972. During the final years of the Saddam era, they envied companies from France, Russia, China, and elsewhere, who had obtained major contracts. But UN sanctions (kept in place by the US and the UK) kept those contracts inoperable. Since the invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003, much has changed. In the new setting, with Washington running the show, \"friendly\" companies expect to gain most of the lucrative oil deals that will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in profits in the coming decades. The Iraqi constitution of 2005, greatly influenced by US advisors, contains language that guarantees a major role for foreign companies. \n \n http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/oil/irqindx.htm",

   "http://www.opinion.co.uk/Newsroom_details.aspx?NewsId=78\n http://www.medialens.org/alerts/07/070918_the_media_ignore.php\n \n The death toll being around 1.2 million, as opposed to arround 800,000 for the Rwandan Genocide.\n \n So says a study by Opinion Research Business, a credible organisation used by the British Conservative Party and the BBC. This confirms an earlier study, published in the worlds top medical journal, The Lancet.\n\n \n \n I'm assuming these numbers are from the invasion till recent a span of about 6 years correct? though i don't doubt that these numbers are accurate, how many civilian casualties were there 6 years prior to the envision. i spoke with a Iraqi who escaped before the invasion at a conference and he spoke of the most inhuman country. Iraq army would come in the village take what they wanted rape their women and kill children he spoke out about a group of children playing soccer and a Iraqi military truck drove over the children. the U.S. record the deaths of women, prior to the invasion Iraq did not they only record the birth and death of males. so to find out real numbers would be hard. i think your forgetting about the mass graves they fund when U.S. troops arrived. \n \n judging by you numbers is yes we are killing civilians. i will also like to ad that bush told every Iraqi to leave Baghdad and other cities because he was going to bomb the cities most did not leave many of the casualties on your list happened in the first months of the war after being to leave or die. i would like to hope that they are simply just collateral damage and not being intensionally killed like cattle as the former Iraqi guard did for the past 30 years. \n \n i am not trying to justify what is going on but in order for these numbers to be of some real use you need to compare the deaths of the Iraqi people 6 years before the war to the 6 years during the war.",
