   "Seriously, read my lips : its - a - FLAG. A peice of cloth. Its not \"disrespecting\" me or any other Marine to burn it, believe me. Spitting in my face or the face of my fellow brothers in the Marines or Army or Navy IS disrespect. You can only disrespect HUMAN BEINGS. A flag is not a HUMAN BEING. I had to salute the damn thing twice a day for morning and evening colors whenever I was in the states for 4 YEARS! Believe me, if people really cared about disrespect to \"our soldiers\" they would be up in arms every time an Officer purposely held everyone around the barracks for \"the word\" until midnight just to be a dick and screw us out of liberty or an NCO got drunk and beat up a PFC cause he didn't like the PFC's haircut. THATS real disrespect and abuse and no one seems to care. In reality the flag is just a way for Americans to feel attached to something most of them never had the guts to do themselves. They like the flag because it reminds them of infantry guys blowing stuff up and stealth bombers tearing across the sky. Things they never quite got around to doing. Well Im here as an infantryman to tell you that its OK if you burn a flag. GASP! Yes, I know! Shocking, but seriously I dont care. If you want to waste your hard earned money from your boring job that you hate to burn a flag to make up for you inadequacies go ahead. As long as its your flag and your matches go right ahead and be angry at daddy all you want. We won't stop you. Now if you burn the Texas or theTennessee flag we might have problems....",
