The trouble is, many of these countries don't want to be like America. It is not America's place to decide how a country should be run. What if a muslim nation decided they needed to set up a proper government in the US and took steps to do so? Obviously American's would be outraged and would probably do whatever it took to stop it. But that is exactly what we are doing to them.\n \n \n\n ok, 2 possible scenarios\n \n 1. we do what they have been asking, pack up and go home, take our business for oil (we find an alternate fuel) and our aid money elsewhere, no consulates, nothing american in the mideast but the occasiaonal tourist... result, they wind up penniless, hungry and still fling their metaphorical poo in our direction\n \n\n \n I never said that we should stop buying oil from them. That would not be in either of our interests. I said we should not have a military presence in their countries. Secondly, Most middle eastern countries have been around a lot longer than the US, so to think that suddenly they are going to collapse if we don't send them our money is absurd. \n \n \n2. we convince them that while we are not like them, we have many things that they do not, and we would like to share them, they get mad and rave about us not respecting their ways (oppressing women.......i wont list it all here but they have alot we would prolly change if we could) and wind up bombing us (like they are doing now) so we have to retaliate, create an arabian \"america\" show them that it works, its better, and much more fun than what they used to do, word will spread throughout the mideast, revolts..........\n\n \n Yes, America has many things that they do not. But many of the things we have are not things they want. Much about America disgusts them (and rightly so). They have no interest in becoming like us.

But, exactly who's 'freedom' are we fighting for? \n \n Our efforts to eliminate terrorism are only adding more fuel to the fire. Why not drasticly reduce the number of people who must die by coming to a comprimise? America needs to stop seeking vengence for what has happened in the past and instead look at what we can do to acheive peace in the future.\n \n Everytime I see one of those \"9/11 We will never forget...\" stickers I stop and wonder why we will never forget. Should we never forget Pearl Harbor and create animosity between us and Japan? Or should we \"never forget the cold war\" and create a rift between us and Russia?",

   "I agree with you that our form of government is superior to theirs. However, it really doesn't matter what you or I think...it is what THEY think, and I think it's painfully obvious that a large percentage of the middle east has no interest in becoming a democracy. They know how a democracy works and they can see it in action by looking at us. They don't need us to set it up for them by showing up with a huge military precense and slaughtering their armies as well as many civilians.\n \n\n \n hmm, ill rebutt this alittle later\n \n \n\n So you are saying we cannot buy oil from the middle east without also having a military presence there? The terrorists are not angry with us because we buy oil from them. They know it is very beneficial to them. They are angry with us because our continuously intrude in their political affairs.\n \n\n of course they are angry that we butt in on their affairs, because we want stability in the region, because we want their oil, no oil no reason to be anywhere near them\n \n \n\n Like I mentioned before, there is no reason why we shouldn't continue to buy oil from them. We need it and they need our money. It's a good situation for everyone.\n \n\n hehe, for everyone, no, for the leaders of their countries who bask in riches\n \n \n\n What they want is to be left alone.\n \n\n of course they do, thats why whenever a problem arises their govs ask us for help or aid\n \n \n\n I find it very amusing that you keep mentioning that we attacked Iraq so they could have freedom. That had absolutely nothing to do with it. We attacked them because we though Saddam had WMD's. Now that it's painfully obvious he didn't, we are coming up with a new rationale for attacking them...this time it's called 'liberation'. We went in there for our OWN self interests, not theirs. When we turn around and try to convince them we are there to help them it's like a huge slap in the face.\n \n\n \n we attacked saddam because he broke his treaty, fired on planes in the no fly zone, refused to let inspectors inspect, a plethora of things, all acts of war commited time and time again, what did the UN do, they passed resolutions which basically said this \"you get one more chance mister saddam, and if you dont comply then we will have to have another meeting, you are scared arent you\" for 10 yrs nothing happened, so we tried to make them act and WMD was a political gamble, it failed, it was a job we had to do anyway, something we left unfinished years ago because of whining pacifists\n \n \n\n So basically what you are saying is that we can't forgive someone until we obliterate them first? \n \n Sometimes that is necessary, but I believe if you have a chance to achieve peace without any more killing you should take it.\n \n\n \n hehe, you forgive someone when they turn a new leaf, so far our enemy hasnt said anything about how we are ok guys, and that they would like to sit down for negotiations with us, to them we are evil, to us they are out to kill us, you do not forgive someone who wishes to kill you, and has the power\n \n \n\n If America was in their situation, many people would do the same thing. But because we have such a strong military that is never an issue. We are so technologically superior to them they know they don't stand a chance fighting us in normal warfare. \n \n That is why they use terrorism. It's the most effective method they have. \n \n\n \n hmm, i must admit that if a gov invaded america i would take up a rifle and die fighting, but there is a major difference in fighting with a rifle, and with a suicide bomb, with the first you have a small chance of success and life\n with the second you have no chance of success and life\n \n \n\n \n You can't eliminate all the terrorists. But you can eliminate their reasons for hating us and that would stop most terrorism.\n \n\n \n exactly, we cant eliminate all terrorists, but if we create a bastion of freedom in the mideast then people will climb any wall to get to it, making them realize we arent evil, yes for awhile they will hate us for it, but the end result is better\n \n \n\n Your assuming that they would see us as weak and try to exploit that. But that simply would not be the case. They already know we are not weak...they are not fools. They would be happy that they got what they wanted, and no more people would have to die. I fail to see what's wrong with that.\n\n \n they know our military is not weak, but they know that our psyche is weak, case in point, first WTC attack, no retaliations (k maybe we fired a few missiles, big whup) nothing happened they attack US embassies nothing happens, they decided we would not retaliate no matter what they did so they tried US soil again, now we have to put the fear of america in them, the fear that if they attack again we will find their hole again and blow it up\n \n \n now to the first one they dont know squat, you give them rational thought when most cannot even read, they are told by their governement and their clerics that we are out to enslave them all, or some similar thing, they dont understand the choices they are being offered, its a damn shame but they are kept ignorant as children, and when your child doesnt want to take a bath do you say \"ok, you know whats best for you\" no, you throw that little munchkin in the tub knowing that someday they will realize that you acted in their best interest\n \n you are operating under the assumption that they will leave us alone if we leave them alone, never gonna happen they hate us and they have malleable masses for disposal, receipe for disaster",

   "The fact that you can rationalize Osama bin laden,leads me to wonder if you think Hitler was a nice guy,or if Charlie Manson should be set free?And to bring up Japan?Do you forget what we did to them in retaliation?And at least Japan had the guts to attack our military,not like some gutless cowards who go after civilians.You should be thankful that you live here,because if it were not for the restraint that our government is showing these XXXXXX,there would be two big crates where afganistan and iraq used to be.But no wait,we try to avoid killing civilians and respect their holy sites.Do you thing your buddy osama would do the same.No he has proven otherwise and needs to be eliminated like hitler and manson!",
