But we still have no warrent to hold them to a different standard just because their speech violates our moral sensibilities. We just have to combat their speech with speech of our own, facts and logic that disprove their own. \n \"To courageous and freedom loving men, with confidence in fearless reasoning applied through the process of popular government, no speech can be deemed 'clear and present' unless the instance of evil is so imminent is to prevent time for discussion.

   "\"advocating doing something that is currently illegal is the only way to change unjust laws.\"\n When you accompany your statements with child pornography, yes it is not only illegal, but it also an infringement upon the rights of the child who had that picture taken. THIS is NOT the way to change laws, it's simply a way to sell child porn. \n So in essence what you're saying is, in order to make murder legal, go out and kill people? emoticon_confused That makes no sense at all. How can you change a crime by commiting it? Advocating a change in law is not the same as violating that law. Advocation of changing a law will not get you thrown in jail, violating it will. However in the advocation of changing the law NAMBLA violates several, theleast of which is the sale and distribution of child pornography, which is illegal to own, as well as illegal to distribute. \n Attempting to make child molestation legal by selling child porn is not the same as saying \"Consensual, homosexual adults should engage in sodomy. I encourage.\" Firstly they aren't so much trying to make it legal as they are selling child porn. Child porn will never be legal in the US due to the fact minors are protected by law, and no one can infringe upon those laws period. \n \"According to you, I can go to jail for this statement:\"\n I never said you could go to jail for saying anything. Quite simply unless you are starting a riot you can say whatever you please. \n \n My point which you are missing, is simply that the ACLU is defending the publication of child pornography, for those who are publishing it, keep in mind the rights being infringed here are not of the sick bugger who reads it, but rather the rights of the minor child who is the subject of it. You can't possibly tell me that a child subjected to this is less deserving of having their rights protected, but yet the ACLU protects NAMBLA because they are the ones making big contributions. So lets support the sex offenders and the heck with the kids??? Support those who break the law not the ones who are violated by their actions. So in essence, support the criminal and the heck with the victim. Interesting philosophy. When someone decides your child should have their picture in a child porn magazine and takes advantage of them, remember that you support the right of those taking those pictures over your kid, after all NAMBLA has the bankroll, and money makes right. \n My point is that the ACLU could have supported the children who had crimes commited against them, but instead decided it would be in the best interest of the country to not only suport but encourage the further infringement of the rights of children for the sake of pedophiles the world over. Oh yes, they are truly a fine organization, where can I send my donation???",

   "The mission of the ACLU is to assure that the Bill of Rights amendments to the Constitution that guard against unwarranted governmental control are preserved for each new generation\n\n \n Of course this is good\n \n \nThe ACLU defends First Amendment rights: These include freedom of speech, association and assembly, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion, including the strict separation between church and state.\n\n \n First amendment rights are very important. They give us the right to freedom of speach. freedom of religion. They also sperate the church from state which is important because not everybody has the same religion. The church is currently not separated from the state. Its in the constitution, but the Conservative Christians don't give a damn, they think their religion is the only right religion and all others are going to hell.\n \n \nThe ACLU defends Equal protection of the law: The right to equal treatment regardless of race, sex, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, age, physical handicap, or other such classification. These rights apply to the voting booth, the classroom, the workplace and the courts.\n\n \n ACLU is great, Being against this is like being against equal treatment for all race, sex, religion, age etc..., It seem conservatives want some people to get treated better than others in court. This means the majority of people on these forums are either racist, sexist, and/or hate teens.\n \n \nThe ACLU defends The right to privacy: The right to a guaranteed zone of personal privacy and autonomy which cannot be penetrated by the government or by other institutions, like employers, with substantial influence over an individual's rights.\n\n \n I don't want the government to be reading my Emails. It seems though that most of you like the fact that the government can spy on you. Sounds intellegent ;) . XXXXXX!\n \n \nThe ACLU supports expanding those protections: Although some segments of our population have traditionally been denied these rights, the ACLU works to extend protection to racial minorities, homosexuals, mental patients, prisoners, soldiers, children in the custody of the state, the handicapped, and Native Americans.\n\n \n I can't believe the conservatives can be against something like this. So you don't want homesexuals and minorities to have equal rights? That is so prejudice. How would you feel if you were black, or if you were gay, and everybody treated you like you were nothing?\n \n \nRoger Baldwin founded the ACLU in 1920, civil liberties were in a sorry state. Citizens were sitting in jail for holding antiwar views. U.S. Attorney General Palmer was conducting raids upon aliens suspected of holding unorthodox opinions. Racial segregation was the law of the land and violence against blacks was routine. Sex discrimination was firmly institutionalized; it wasn't until 1920 that women even got the vote. Constitutional rights for homosexuals, the poor, prisoners, mental patients, and other special groups were literally unthinkable. And, perhaps most significantly, the Supreme Court had yet to uphold a single free speech claim under the First Amendment.\n\n \n So the majority of you want people to get arrested for antiwar views. It sure does seem like it. So you don't want woman to vote either? you sexist bastards. It looks like the majority of people here don't want freedom of speach, rights for gays, woman rights, civil rights for minorities, and want the government to spy on us as well. \n \n \nAny organization that supports anything remotely related to legalization of child pornography should be burned and all it's members shot.\n\n \n Sorry I have to say this but, you are an idiot. Stop making up facts, they said nothing about supporting child pornography. You must be very stupid to make information like this and then believe them.\n \n \n \nYou mean the Anti-Christian Liberties Union?\n\n \n Oh by seperating church and state, you would be anti-Christian?

Even though Communism often leads to the LACK of civil rights.
