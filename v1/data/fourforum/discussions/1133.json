   "Of course, but child molestation 80% of the time is done by married men. Some may be gay, of course, but again that's irrelivent. However, there are some problems with homosexual lifestyle. 10% of homosexuals (I believe that is the most recent statistic) have HIV/AIDS. This is several times higher than the national average. What is worse is that they are having sexual intercourses so many times in one life that there is no wonder HIV is spreading amongst them. I cannot remember the statistic I read, but according to this statistic which, when I read it, seemed very prestigious and not biased, said that gays have some outstanding amount of relationships in their lives, several times more than heterosexuals. Meaning, homosexuals spread AIDS faster. \n \n Another problem I have with the homosexual agenda is that it's so open. I don't mind people who are homosexual, but I don't think it's appropriate to have festivals and parades celebrating their \"Diversity\". I'm straight, and so is most of America. Should I have a parade celebrating straight \"diversity\"? Of course not. Further, homosexuals impose their beliefs on children. I could remember every year at elementary school we would have \"gay pride day\", and gay parents would come and talk to us, basically brainwashing us into believing that their lives were completely acceptable, and homosexuality is normal. First of all, psychologically, it is an inbalance of parental figures, but that is another issue. The point is that they are brainwashing children. Homosexuality is not something the school should be teaching, just like religious beliefs. Further, in High School, homosexual (and heterosexual) \"safe\" sex is basically encouraged among minors! This is not appropriate. Teenagers should not be encouraged to have sex, nor should they have sex in the first place. \n \n I simply think that homosexuals are way too open and way too subjagative.",

Why is heterosexuality, and homosexuality the only two forms of sex that should be taught? Why are you passing judgment on the lifestyles of bestists? And what about all the other 'phillias' that you are now degrading. Surely they have a right to be heard too?\n \n In other words... Why is it that only one XXXXX lifestyle should be heard and not all others?\n \n \nHere we have a minority - just one mind you, promoting their own self-interest, wanting to teach people that their own XXXXX behaviour is okay - but not promoting other XXXXX behaviours (like the one I mentioned a moment ago)\n\n \n \nYes, that is correct. However, it is clearly not just homosexuals who think homosexuality is okay. \n\n \n I repeat, Why is it that only one XXXXX lifestyle should be heard and not all others?\n \n \nIn fact, the whole concept of teaching children should appal you.

There was also straight porn accessible by the way...\n \n Poll: Support Grows for Gay Marriage\n \n \n \n (Washington, D.C.) A new poll suggests that Americans are growing more comfortable with the idea of same-sex marriage. \n \n The USA Today/CNN poll, released Tuesday, shows the country equally divided on gay marriage. Though still not majority support, it is a marked improvement from a similar poll a month ago.\n \n The USA Today/CNN survey found that 50% say that same-sex marriage would have a positive impact or have no effect at all, while 48% of those surveyed say allowing gay unions \"will change our society for the worse\". \n \n A similar poll conducted last month by ABC News found that 55 percent of those questioned rejected the idea of granting legal marriage rights to gays and lesbians. 37 percent said same-sex marriage should be legal. (story) \n \n Today's poll was released as pressure on Republicans from conservative groups mounts for a constitutional amendment to permanently bar gays and lesbians from marrying, (story) and as the right wing of the Episcopal Church meets in Dallas to consider splitting over the faith's endorsement of a gay bishop in New Hampshire. (story) \n \n A USA Today analysis of the poll results says growing support for same-sex marriage, and civil unions, reflects general changes in American life.\n \n \"American couples increasingly are choosing civil wedding ceremonies over clergy-performed ones,\" says the paper.\n \n \"The trend reflects the loosening hold that traditional religion has on the most personal choices in people's lives ... A society that increasingly sees God's blessing on marriage as optional may be more likely to accept same-sex unions,\" the paper says.\n \n \"Marriage has changed more in roles and function in the last 30 years than in the last 3,000,\" says historian Stephanie Coontz of the Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash. Coontz is writing a book on the history of marriage.\n \n She says efforts to focus on traditional religious views of marriage are a \"last-ditch attempt to say this is as far as we can go.\"\n \n But \"when I see the battle lines drawn around gay and lesbian unions, (opponents) are locking the barn door after the horses are gone,\" Coontz says.\n \n According to the survey, a higher number of churchgoers are among the 48% of those surveyed who say \"allowing two people of the same sex to legally marry will change our society for the worse.\" Of those who attend religious services weekly, 67% say they believe this, as do 51% of those who go at least once a month.\n \n Among those who never go to church, nearly three in four (72%) say there would be no ill effects.\n \n The poll was taken for USA Today/CNN by Gallup. 1,003 adults were surveyed between Sept. 19-21.",

The latest findings were reported today by researchers from the University of California. \n \n The scientists, in a statement, said that sexual identity is \"hard-wired\" into the genes.\n \n \"Sexual identity is rooted in every person's biology before birth and springs from a variation in our individual genome,\" said Dr. Eric Vilain, a genetics professor at the UCLA School of Medicine.\n \n Vilain and his team of researchers have identified 54 genes in mice that may explain why male and female brains look and function differently. They used two separate genetic testing methods to compare the production of genes in male and female brains in embryonic mice -- long before the animals developed sex organs.\n \n They discovered 54 genes produced in different amounts in male and female mouse brains. Eighteen of the genes were produced at higher levels in the male brains; 36 were produced at higher levels in the female brains. \n \n \"We discovered that the male and female brains differed in many measurable ways, including anatomy and function.\" Vilain said. Among the differences, the two hemispheres of the brain appeared more symmetrical in females than in males. According to Vilain, the symmetry may improve communication between both sides of the brain, leading to enhanced verbal expressiveness in females. \n \n Vilian warns though that finding the exact gene that results in homosexuality will require considerable more research. He said that if future research does determine conclusively that homosexuality is genetic and not a choice, the implications would be huge. \n \n \"If it's not a choice, you can't have the typical conservative argument that says you choose this lifestyle so you have to bear the consequences and society has no reason to basically give you any rights because you choose to be an outcast,\" Vilain said.\n \n \"If you can't do anything about it, therefore you should have all the rights to be integrated into society and have the same rights as heterosexuals in terms of marriage and the rights to inheritance.\"\n \n Vilain said the initial emphasis will be on determining the origin of transgenderism. He says the research may help doctors determine the proper gender assignment of babies born with ambiguous genitalia. \n \n \"If physicians could predict the gender of newborns with ambiguous genitalia at birth, we would make less mistakes in gender assignment,\" Vilain said.\n \n Typically such a baby is assigned a gender and in many places in North America genital surgery is performed to make the genitals appear to conform to the gender selected.\n \n But many grow up very unhappy, feeling the surgery was harmful by assigning them a gender they didn't feel was appropriate.\n \n The Human Rights Campaign welcomed the results but said that laws should protect all Americans equally, regardless of the genetic basis for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.\n \n \"This study is part of a growing body of evidence showing that it is likely that sexual orientation and gender identity are genetically based,\" said Elizabeth Birch, HRC's executive director.\n \n \"Although further research will be conducted by this team, at the end of the day, the question of nature versus nurture shouldn't matter. Laws in America should protect everybody equally, regardless of what causes differences of sexual orientation or gender identity.\"\n \n Last week, British psychologists also said they have found strong evidence to support the theory that a person's sexuality is \"hard-wired\" into the brain before birth.

KRISTOF\n \n ome people say we should settle gay rights disputes on the basis of the Old Testament. I say we should rely on blinking patterns.\n \n In case you've misplaced your latest copy of Behavioral Neuroscience, there's a fascinating article about how people blink. It turns out that when males and females are exposed to a loud noise, they blink in somewhat different ways - except that lesbians appear to blink like men, not like women.\n \n The study (peer-reviewed but based on a small sample) is the latest in a growing scientific literature suggesting that sexual preferences may be not simply a matter of personal preference but part of our ingrained biology. Indeed, some geneticists believe that sexual orientation in men (though not women) may be determined in part by markers in the Xq28 chromosomal region.\n \n One needs to be wary of these kinds of studies, partly because researchers drawn toward this field may have subconscious biases of their own. Moreover, many of the studies on the biological basis of homosexuality are flawed by small numbers or by the difficulty of finding valid random samples of gays and heterosexuals.\n \n Still, while the data has problems, it is piling up - there are at least seven studies on twins. If there is a genetic component to homosexuality, one would expect identical twins to share sexual orientation more than fraternal twins, and that is indeed the case. An identical twin of a gay person is about twice as likely to be gay as a fraternal twin would be.\n \n Earlier this year, the journal Personality and Individual Differences published an exhaustive review of the literature entitled \"Born Gay?\" After reviewing the twin studies, it concluded that 50 to 60 percent of sexual orientation might be genetic.\n \n Many studies also suggest that sexual orientation may be linked to differences in brain anatomy. Compared with straight men, gay men appear to have a larger suprachiasmatic nucleus, a part of the brain that affects behavior, and some studies show most gay men have a larger isthmus of the corpus callosum - which may also be true of left-handed people. And that's intriguing because gays are 39 percent more likely to be left-handed than straight people.\n \n Now look at your fingers. Men typically have a ring finger that is longer than the index finger, while in women the two are about the same length. However, two studies have suggested that lesbians have finger-length ratios that are more like those of men than of women.\n \n Studies suggest that ring-finger length has to do with the level of androgens in the womb, and that may help explain another puzzle of homosexuality: a male is more likely to be gay if he has older brothers. It doesn't matter if he has older sisters, but for each older brother he is about 33 percent more likely to be gay. Some scientists speculate that a woman's body adjusts the androgen level in her womb as she has more sons, and that the androgens interact with genes to produce homosexuality.\n \n O.K., these theories are potentially junk science until the studies are replicated with much larger numbers. But we also shouldn't ignore the accumulating evidence.\n \n \"There is now very strong evidence from almost two decades of `biobehavioral' research that human sexual orientation is predominantly biologically determined,\" said Qazi Rahman, the University of London researcher who led the blinking study. Many others don't go that far, but accept that there is probably some biological component.\n \n Gays themselves are divided. Some welcome these studies because they confirm their own feeling that sexual orientation is more than a whim. Others fret that the implication is that homosexuals are abnormal or defective - and that future genetic screening will eliminate people like them.\n \n For me the implication, if these studies are to believed, is different: It is that something is defective not in gays, but in discrimination against them.\n \n A basic principle of our social covenant is that we do not discriminate against people on the basis of circumstances that they cannot choose, like race, sex and disability. If sexual orientation belongs on that list (with the caveat that the evidence is still murky), then should we still prohibit gay marriage and bar gays from serving openly in the armed forces?\n \n Can we countenance discrimination against people for something so basic as how they blink - or whom they love?",

   "Three of your links are from homosexual sites, and another from the New York Times, one of the most liberal newspapers in the nation. Give me scientific evidence, not political opinion. The article did not provide very many sources. \n \n \n You are absolutely wrong Parcum. I frankly don't know what world you live in. Homosexuality is not a mental illness. There is plenty of evidence to suggest homosexuals are born homosexual. Homosexuality is not chosen. I will post links in my following messages.\n\n \n I live in San Francisco, the most gay city in the world. I know enough about homosexuality to know that it is absolutely impossible for somebody to be gay, let alone be straight. Sexual orientation isn't determined until the third adolescence. Occasionally some abnormalities occur, where the child comes out gay. \n \n \"Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience.\"\n \n From your own APA link: \n \n \"In most people, sexual orientation is shaped at an early age. There is also considerable 0recent evidence to suggest that biology, including genetic or inborn hormonal factors, play a significant role in a person's sexuality.\" here\n \n It simply says that there is evidence, that doesn't mean they support the study neither does it mean it's true. Read below for further explaination.\n \n \n The study (peer-reviewed but based on a small sample) is the latest in a growing scientific literature suggesting that sexual preferences may be not simply a matter of personal preference but part of our ingrained biology. Indeed, some geneticists believe that sexual orientation in men (though not women) may be determined in part by markers in the Xq28 chromosomal region.\n\n \n The study took place in 1993, and was called the \"Harmer Study\", claiming that homosexuality was genetic. However, the study was done very poorly , as the Dean Harmer, the man who made the study, only interviewed 40 homosexual men and decided after studying chromosomes that they were done gay. Harmer didn't study any genetics or biology, he simply came up with the conclusion that sometimes the mothers would carry more X chromosomes then Y chromosomes. The study was weak, and yet everyone took the study, which was not even considered a theory, as fact.\n \n Later, when Harmer did finally study the genetics of the issue in 1995(?), he did a Linkage study. He found out that out of 33/40 homosexual brothers, they had an Xq28 gene. From that, he concluded that was the cause. Firstly, a Linkage Study is where they look at the genes of the child, mother, father, and various relatives, and look for patterns from both sides of the family. By this they can predict diseases, but never have been able to prove psychological patterns, as they are much more complex then biological patterns. Second, the Xq28 gene wasn't put to test, but simply accepted. Many questions must be asked before it is concluded- does it control sexual orientation? Does it have anything to do with psychology? Do only homosexuals have this gene? Do most people have this gene? What is the gene anyway? None of these questions were answered. For all we know, Xq28 could simply be a gene that gives people the urge to eat strawberries! No evidence was laid out; it was entirely based on theory. \n \n What's even more interesting is that many scientists have attempted to replicate Harmer's study, but weren't able to. Further, Doctors George Rice and George Ebers of University of Ontario and Stanford University attempted to replicate the Xq28 study. In 1999, out of the same news paper that Harmer used to publish his study, they stated \"These results do not support an X-linked gene underlying male homosexuality.\" They found that out of 52 homosexuals only 50% had the Xq28 gene. They concluded that there was no evidence the Xq28 gene had anything to do with sexual orientation.\n \n Homosexual activist Edward Stein disagrees:\n \n \"There are serious problems with the science itself. ... My training had taught me that a lot of what was being said was, well, highly unscientific.\" Michael Bronski, \"Blinded by Science,\" The Advocate, February 1, 2000, p. 64.\n \n And later:\n \n  Genes in themselves cannot directly specify any behavior or psychological phenomenon. Instead, genes direct a particular pattern of RNA synthesis, which in turn may influence the development of psychological dispositions and the expression of behaviors. There are necessarily many intervening pathways between a gene and a disposition or a behavior, and even more intervening variables between a gene and a pattern that involves both thinking and behaving. The terms 'gay gene' and 'homosexual gene' are, therefore, without meaning. No one has presented evidence in support of such a simple and direct link between genes and sexual orientation. Stein, op. cit., p. 221.\n \n \n In March of 1993 the magazine Archives of General Psychiatry, two Psychologists studied Harmer's study, and concluded that \"...there is no evidence at present to substantiate a biologic theory. The appeal of current biologic explanations for sexual orientation may dervie more from dissatisfaction with the present status of psychosocial explanations than from a substantiating body of experimental data.\"\n \n More quotes against homosexual births/conception:\n \n  \"Time and time again, scientists have claimed that particular genes or chromosomal regions are associated with behavioral traits, only to withdraw their findings when they were not replicated. 'Unfortunately,' says Yale's [Dr. Joel] Gelernter, 'it's hard to come up with many' findings linking specific genes to complex human behaviors that have been replicated. 'All were announced with great fanfare; all were greeted unskeptically in the popular press; all are now in disrepute.'\"\n C. Mann, \"Genes and Behavior,\" Science 264 (1994): 1687.\n \n \"Science has not yet discovered any genetically dictated behavior in humans. So far, genetically dictated behaviors of the one-gene-one-trait variety have been found only in very simple organisms. The closest thing to a genetically-caused human behavior that science has come up with in humans so far (aggression in Dutch men related to a mutation of one gene), is far too responsive to counseling and varied in its expression to be genetically determined. This raises the obvious question: is there really any such thing as a genetically-caused human behavior? Neil and Briar Whitehead, My Genes Made Me Do It!

   "Here are some findings from the scientific peer-reviewed journal, \"Pediatrics\" \n published in July of 1994. The study was done by Dr. Carole Jenny of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. The subjects were 269 sexually abused children seen at Denver Children's Hospital over the course of one year. \n \n \n *1 in 219 girls was molested by a lesbian * 1 out of 50 boys by a gay male.*About 8 in 10 girls were molested by a man who was or had been in a heterosexual relationship with the child's mother or another relative. *3 out of 4 boys were abused by males in heterosexual relationships with female relatives. \n \n \n 2% of the boys in the study were molested by gay males. \n \n \n 98% of the boys in the study were molested by heterosexuals. Of that number, 75% were molested by heterosexual males KNOWN TO THE VICTIMS in an incestuous scenario.\n \n \n 0.05% of the girls in the study were molested by a lesbian. \n \n \n 99.5% of the girls in the study were molested by heterosexuals. Of that number, 80% were molested by heterosexual males KNOWN TO THE VICTIMS in an incestuous scenario. \n \n \n If you think that study is unique, I invite you to investigate some more references, all of which report parallel numbers.\n \n \n Groth, A. Nicholas, and H. Jean Birnbaum, 1978 \"Adult Sexual Orientation and Attraction to Underage Persons\", Archives of Sexual Behavior, 7, 175.\n \n \n \"Suggests that homosexuality and homosexual pedophilia may be mutually exclusive and that the adult heterosexual male constitutes a greater risk to the underage child than does the adult homosexual male.\" [p 609]\n \n \n Newton, David E., 1978 \"Homosexual Behavior and Child Molestation: A Review of the Evidence\", Adolescence, 13, 29.\n \n \n \"Existing studies provide no reason to believe that anything other than a random connection exists between homosexual behavior and child molestation.

Philadelphia, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, c2000\n \n Fact sheet prepared by Mary Barber, MD\n \n \n Using the fixated-regressed distinction, Groth and Birnbaum (1978) studied 175 adult males who were convicted in Massachusetts of sexual assault against a child. None of the men had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation. 83 (47%) were classified as \"fixated;\" 70 others (40%) were classified as regressed adult heterosexuals; the remaining 22 (13%) were classified as regressed adult bisexuals. Of the last group, Groth and Birnbaum observed that \"in their adult relationships they engaged in sex on occasion with men as well as with women. However, in no case did this attraction to men exceed their preference for women....There were no men who were primarily sexually attracted to other adult males...\" (p.180). \n \n \n Other \n Approaches Other researchers have taken different approaches, but have similarly failed to find a connection between homosexuality and child molestation. Dr. Carole Jenny reviewed 352 medical charts, representing all of the sexually abused children seen in the emergency room or child abuse clinic of a Denver children's hospital during a one-year period (from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992). The molester was a gay or lesbian adult in only 2 of the 269 cases in which an adult molester could be identified - fewer than 1% (Jenny et al., 1994). \n In yet another approach to studying adult sexual attraction to children, some Canadian researchers observed how homosexual and heterosexual adult men responded to slides of males and females of various ages (child, pubescent, and mature adult). All of the research subjects were first screened to ensure that they preferred physically mature sexual partners. In some of the slides shown to subjects, the model was clothed; in others, he or she was nude. The slides were accompanied by audio recordings. The recordings paired with the nude models described an imaginary sexual interaction between the model and the subject. The recordings paired with the pictures of clothed models described the model engaging in neutral activities (e.g., swimming). To measure sexual arousal, changes in the subjects' penis volume were monitored while they watched the slides and listened to the audiotapes. The researchers found that homosexual males responded no more to male children than heterosexual males responded to female children (Freund et al., 1989). \n \n Science cannot prove a negative. Thus, these studies do not prove that homosexual or bisexual males are no more likely than heterosexual males to molest children. However, each of them failed to prove the alternative hypothesis that homosexual males are more likely than heterosexual men to molest children or to be sexually attracted to children or adolescents. \n \n \n The Mainstream \n View Reflecting the results of these and other studies, the mainstream view among researchers and professionals who work in the area of child sexual abuse is that homosexual and bisexual men do not pose any special threat to children. For example, in one review of the scientific literature, noted authority Dr. A. Nicholas Groth wrote: \n \n Are homosexual adults in general sexually attracted to children and are preadolescent children at greater risk of molestation from homosexual adults than from heterosexual adults? There is no reason to believe so. The research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation. There appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults, and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual (Groth & Gary, 1982, p. 147). \n In a more recent literature review, Dr. Nathaniel McConaghy (1998) similarly cautioned against confusing homosexuality with pedophilia. He noted, \"The man who offends against prepubertal or immediately postpubertal boys is typically not sexually interested in older men or in women\" (p. 259). \n \n http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html\n \n http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/editorial/3305138.htm",

I hope every member will read the following links, which discuss some of Cameron's claims already posted, and other amusing claims....\n \n The source of the right's statistics linking gay men with child molestation is discredited psychologist Paul Cameron, who operates the Family Research Institute in Colorado Springs, Colorado.[12] Cameron is responsible for many of the right's most bizarre allegations about gays and lesbians, such as that gays constitute 44 percent of sexual mass murderers, that two-thirds of gay men \"ingest biologically significant amounts of feces,\" and that being a gay male takes 30 years off one's life.[13]\n \n But Cameron is hardly a credible source. He was dropped from the American Psychological Association back in 1983 for a violation of its Ethical Principles of Psychologists.[14] And he's been censured by four other professional associations and a federal court.[15]\n \n http://www.robincmiller.com/gayles4.htm\n \n http://www.indegayforum.org/articles/pietrzyk53.html\n \n http://surge.ods.org/idle/homosexual/myths_ab.htm",

By the time kids are five, how many times have they been told in so many ways that girl+boy=couple? Heterosexuality is literally thrust upon infants. I've seen newborn boys get called \"flirts\" for looking at women. It's ubiquitous, that's why yuo don't need het day.

The point is, we shouldn't ever tell children that there is only one type of family.\n \n \nPassing out condoms is a perfect example. If condoms weren't passed out, teens would be afraid to have sex, as the risks are enormous. However, condoms are passed out, and now teenagers are having sex more often. It is ridiculous.\n\n \n Any numbers to back this up, or are you going by personal experience?\n \n All the statistics I've seen show a decrease in teen pregnancy and STDs, with no marked increase in sexual activity when kids are given access to condoms. I quoted some numbers elsewhere on the forum, I guess I could find them again...\n \n \nThis doesn't have to do with innocent childhood, it has to do with morality. Teen sex is wrong and should certainly not be encouraged by adults.\n\n \n Ok, so now teens can't have sex too. Who, in your opinion, gets to have sex? Why don't you tell us how they can have sex too. Is it only when they plan on having kids, or can a heterosexual white married couple between the ages of 25 and 35 have sex with prophylactics? If they can't, are they also not allowed to engage in \"homosexual activities\" such as oral or anal sex? Are they allowed to do it in the daytime, or only with the lights out between 11:30 pm and 1 am?\n \n Somehow, I suspect your morality is based on the idea that sex is immoral.

   "(copied out of my post in the general debates)\n \n I need to make something clear. God loves homosexuals. There is NO one he won't forgive if they will ask him. If we could do anything that would stop him from loving us, we all would have done it. You know, something I've been noticing is that the laws and instructions in the Bible seem to have a reason behind them. The reason for most, or all, of the laws, it seems to me, is because they are good for you. For example \"Thou shalt not covet\". It says 'don't be jealous. We all know how jealousy can poison. Paul says something interesting in the New Testament. \"Everything is permissable for me, not all things are beneficial\" I guess it could be interpreted as saying nothing is sinful, just bad for you. I wouldn't say that, because of the numbers of verses saying that sin is evil and wrong. The point is, God cares about you, that's why he gave us these rules. They aren't meant to prevent people from having fun, or to keep them under control. I beleive C.S. Lewis said Christianity is protrayed as boring and rigid(ever thought heaven would be boring?) while doing whatever you want is protrayed as exciting and freeing - but in truth, it is the other way around. The bible says \"don't commit adultery\" and people say that's rigid and ridiculous. Yet if people didn't ever, relationships would be far more trusting, and STD's wouldn't exist. Wouldn't that be 'freeing'? \n \n I was stunned to find out that the life expectancy for homosexuals is something like 55 years. People said it was caused by persecution and fear. \n \n Boundless (again :) )\n \"...homosexuality is widely associated with behavior best described as compulsive. Numerous studies have found that the average male homosexual is fantastically promiscuous. One of the most extensive studies, by researchers A.P. Bell and M.S. Weinberg, found that over the course of a lifetime:\n \n \u009573 percent of gay men had over 100 partners,\n \u009558 percent had over 250 partners,\n \u009541 percent had over 500 partners and\n \u009526 percent had over 1,000 partners. \n \n A man with that many female partners would be considered a sex addict. But among homosexuals, he's par for the course. The leading gay magazine, The Advocate, has reported that \"of 600 gay and bisexual male Milwaukeans, 73 percent said they've had sex in the past six months with someone they never saw again.\"\n \n Even generally liberal media outlets have noticed the unhealthy mindset commonly found among homosexuals. \"Hard as it may be to understand, some gay men have unsafe sex because they want to get HIV - or at least skate close to the edge,\" said a Newsweek article last year. \"Danger can be erotic, even the threat of contracting a deadly disease.\" The article quotes a University of Florida student saying, \"If someone has AIDS or HIV, that kind of lionizes them. It's heroic, like fighting the battle. ... When you get with someone who has HIV, it's like being with someone greater than you are.\"\n \n The problem goes beyond promiscuity. Gays (male and female) are much more inclined to smoke, drink and use illegal drugs than the rest of society. A comprehensive study in the American Journal of Public Health (no. 84: 1994) found that 50 percent of gay males and 41 percent of lesbians have used hallucinogens such as LSD; and 79 percent of gay men and 82 percent of lesbians have used marijuana.\n \n Gay spokesmen typically blame risky behavior on society's intolerance, which they claim has driven them to flout the rules. Ironically, such conduct tends to be most intense in places where homosexuality faces the least disapproval - large cities (New York, San Francisco) and college campuses with concentrated gay communities. \"Promiscuity, drug abuse, suicide, HIV - all of them are worst where homosexuality is most accepted,\" says John Paulk, a leader in the ex-gay group Exodus International. \"\n \n Maybe there is something wrong",

   "The gay lifespan is not 55 years.\n \n Problems with the Bell and Weinberg sampling....\n \n 1) The sampling of the homosexuals in the study was not random, and they admit as much. The heterosexual sample was random, using census data and land tracts to ensure a random sample, and going to exhaustive lengths to make sure those samples were truly random. While they did go to great lengths to get a large sample group of homosexuals, and I don't doubt that their data is representative of the sample they were testing, their data is absolutely not generalizable due to the clear fact that their sample was not a random sample. \n \n 2) Another reason why their data is not generalizable is that they while they did a survey of heterosexuals as well as homosexuals, for some reason they didn't include the heterosexual data. For example, while they claim that one homosexual respondent claims to have had sex with over 10,000 people, and a large percentage of their sample claim to have had sex with over 500 people, they do not give correlative data on the heterosexual sample. For all we know the heterosexual sample may have had a greater number of sexual partners than the homosexual sample. Without this control group, we cannot generalize their sample to the population at large, because we do not know that their population represents national norms since we have no heterosexual control group. It is possible that the heterosexual statistics were equally high, and could have shown that the data does not represent promiscuity specifically among gays, but of the sexually active single person in San Francisco in the 1970's. \n \n 3) A third problem, still relating to the heterosexual sample, is that it did not represent a true control group. Apart from the fact that the homosexual sample was not random and the heterosexual sample was, the homosexual samples were taken from the following places: singles bars (22%), gay baths (9%), public places (=guys hanging out in parks to find sex partners; 6%), private bars (=sex clubs; 5%), personal contacts (people that the bar people, public place people, bath house people, etc, knew personally and referred; 23%), public advertising + organizations + mailing lists (29%).The heterosexual sample, on the other hand, were people in residential areas, admittedly including married people. These two samples are not parallel, and even if they had included the heterosexual data, they would not be comparable. In order for this data to have been generalizable, they would have had to go to heterosexual singles bars, sex clubs, bookstores, etc, to get their population. \n \n 4) They used Kinsey 2-6 for their inclusion of homosexual population. Their sample does not represent only homosexual persons, but also includes bisexual persons.\n \n The problem with the advocate survey you cite, is that I don't know the samples. How random was it. It could have been taken from bar patrons. Many studies on gays in regards to their sex habits and alcohol and drug use are notorious for looking at convenient samples of bar patrons. They don't make such generalizations about heterosexuals from the patrons of heterosexual singles bars. \n \n A 1994 study in The Advocate, reported that 52% of the gay male couples described themselves as being monogamous (\"The 1994 Advocate Survey of Sexuality and Relationships: The Men,\" The Advocate, August 23, 1994, pp. 16-24).\n \n The article about the so-called \"bug chasers\" appeared in Rolling Stone, and indeed, Newsweek did discuss it.\n \n Cabaj was attributed with revealing the article's most startling statistic, but now says: 'The figure is totally false. I never said that. And when the fact checker called me and asked me if I said that, I said no.' \n \n There was no way of knowing what percentage of gay men were looking to get infected but that it was likely to be very small, he added. \n \n Forstein was quoted by the magazine as saying that 'bug chasers' were seen regularly in his health system. 'That is entirely a fabrication,' he now says. 'I have seen two such cases in the last three years, and I can count on one hand how many patients like that I've seen in the last 21 years. I said this was a small phenomenon, that it's a real and significant phenomenon for a specific group of men. \n \n 'The real phenomenon in the gay community is that many gay men do not take safe sex seriously. That's a real problem.'\n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3...-106925,00.html\n \n February 17, 2003 Newsweek \n Media: Using 'Bug Chasers'\n \n Seth Mnookin \n \n A special report in Rolling Stone's Feb. 6 issue got a lot of attention, but not the kind of buzz magazines look for. \"Bug Chasers--The Men Who Long to Be HIV+\" was shocking, but as soon as the article hit the streets, the only two medical doctors quoted in the piece told NEWSWEEK that quotes attributed to them had been either twisted or fabricated. Dr. Bob Cabaj, cited as the source for a claim that 25 percent of all newly infected gay men are either consciously or unconsciously \n \n [View the full-text article, 283 words] \n \n I'm really not too concerned if drug users are black or white, gay or straight, dark-haired or light-haired, upper-class or lower-class. Drug users could come from any or a number of those backgrounds. For whomever they may be, and for whatever reason they are using drugs(could be many reasons), they need compassion.

They have very different social structures, and exhibit very different behaviours. It is clear that bonobos engage in what in humans would be described as homosexual behaviour. In the context of bonobo social structure such activities function as a reward or currency. For example, a female bonobo will show another female bonobo where a nice fruit tree is hidden, and in response the other will begin to engage her in genito-genital rubbing, or \"frottage\". Similarly, male bonobos who hunt together or share spoils will \"reward\" each other.\n \n Now, I would never be one to try to define \"normalcy\", nor do I think that animal behaviour can be analyzed to explain human behaviour (I'm totally against socio-biology), but to say that animals do not engage in \"homosexual\" behaviour is false. \n \n I mean, babies masterbate. Parcum probably thinks masturbation is unnatural as well. I don't know how many diapers you've changed, but let me assure you that if infant behavior is any indicator of \"normalcy\" or \"natural\" behavior, than masturbation should be considered as normal as sneezing. \n \n \nAll of the gay men and lesbians I know are in excellent health, and so am I.\n\n \n Glad to hear it. :)\n \n \nThere was a girl at my school who was telling us about when she'd gone onto a gay chatroom. She asked them \"Doesn't it hurt?\". Yes, its 100% politically incorrect, yet has a ring of truth to it, don't you think?\n\n \n Ummhmmm... Ever talked to anyone who's been on the receiving end of a penis? It hurts, if you're a girl, a boy or whatever. Most people's experience of penetration is that it's pretty damn painful. Especially at first, or if you're nervous, or if it's Bad sex. For sure, no matter what you are engaging in as a sexual practice, if the sex is Bad, it'll hurt. Bad sex probably causes more pain than any given sexual practice- even counting accidentally interlocking piercings!\n \n Personally, I think Bad sex is a sin. I'm dedicated to abstinence of Bad sex, I haven't had Bad sex in years, and I used to have Bad sex all the time! I think I'm going to start picketing the houses of people who I know are guilty of Bad sex, for the sake of humanity's salvation. End Bad sex now! ;)",

Children who are born to or adopted by 1 member of a same-sex couple deserve the security of 2 legally recognized parents. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics supports legislative and legal efforts to provide the possibility of adoption of the child by the second parent or coparent in these families.\"\n \n Apparently there are many problems with the AAP report...\n \n Homosexual Adoption Controversy Divides US Pediatricians\n Lawrence Morahan\n Senior Staff Writer\n \n (CNSNews.com) - When the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) endorsed adoptions by homosexual couples earlier this year, it did so based on insufficient and inaccurate data, a group of dissenting AAP members has charged.\n \n The assertion that children who grow up with same-sex parents fare as well emotionally and socially as children whose parents are heterosexual - as claimed in the February 2002 AAP report on adoption by same-sex couples - is misleading and should not be cited as fact, they said.\n \n \"This statement generated for the AAP more controversy than almost any other statement in anyone's memory, and most of our memories go back a long way,\" said Joseph Zanga, a professor of pediatrics and a former AAP president.\n \n \n \n According to a summary of the report: \"There is no systematic difference between gay and non-gay parents in emotional health, parenting skills and attitudes towards parenting. No data have pointed to any risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with one or more gay parents.\"\n \n Since the report itself acknowledges a scarcity of data on the issue, many AAP members contended the organization should have published it as an opinion, not fact, or discarded it altogether, Zanga said.\n \n The report proved to be the last straw for some members, who for years have been disenchanted with the AAP's positions on other contentious issues involving children, including condom distribution and parental consent for abortion, Zanga said.\n \n Based on what they see as the report's lack of scientific integrity, a number of members have gotten together to form the American College of Pediatricians (ACP) in an effort to distinguish their positions from those of the AAP.\n \n The ACP leaders don't see the new organization as an alternate to the AAP, but as a complimentary group, much like the Society for Adolescent Medicine or the Ambulatory Pediatric Association, said Zanga, a charter member.\n \n \"What the ACP is dedicated to, like the AAP, is to the optimum physical, mental and social health and well being of infants, children, adolescents and young adults,\" he said. \n \n The college, however, will emphasize the health and well being of the child within the context of a married mother-father household.\n \n \"We see that as the optimum, but our membership will work with and help other families who are not so fortunate,\" Zanga said.\n \n The 'Non-Traditional' Family\n \n Joseph F. Hagan, M.D., chairman of the AAP committee on Psycho-Social Aspects of Child and Family Health - which prepared the report - said although the data is limited, the researchers produced a very good review of the available literature.\n \n The authors relied only on research from reputable professional journals from the University of Vermont College of Medicine and the University of Vermont Library, Hagan said.\n \n \"Our committee looked very hard to see if there was any evidence of harm by having children have two parents who were of the same gender, and if that data is out there, I will tell you we sure couldn't find it,\" Hagan said.\n \n Indeed, researchers were unlikely to find scientific studies that reliably compare heterosexual parented families with homosexual parented families, Hagan noted.\n \n \"There are a lot of types of non-traditional families and I think there are tremendous differences in the family, some of which can be cast as weaknesses, some of which certainly can be cast as strengths.\n \n \"But families in our nation and in the world don't all look alike. I see these families as simply another type of non-traditional family,\" he said.\n \n Having an adoptive parent is better than being in the state adoptive system. Similarly, having two parents is better than one, Hagan said.\n \n However, Hagan said, neither the AAP report nor its summary were meant to be taken as \"new literature.\"\n \n \"They were not scientific statements, and if people are citing them in opposition to us, then there's my correction. If people are citing us in support, then I would give them the caveat that this is the opinion of the majority of the members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and this is the literature review that was used to base that opinion,\" he said.\n \n Indeed, the AAP leadership has voted to support the statement. At a recent meeting of the AAP's chapter forum, which comprises the presidents and vice presidents of the AAP's state chapters, members voted virtually unanimously to support the academy's stand on homosexual parenting, Hagan and Zanga reported.\n \n However, \"No one knows and no one will ever know where the real numbers fall,\" Zanga said. \"My suspicion is that there is a sizeable group of the membership that supports the AAP's statement; there's a sizeable group that opposes the AAP's statement and there's that vast middle ground who really don't even care.\"\n \n Peter Sprigg, director of cultural studies with the Family Research Council, said the AAP statement was the result of political pressure from within the organization.\n \n A secondary factor in support of the statement is a possible level of economic self-interest in that physicians may see the expansion of adoption and domestic partner benefits as a way of expanding health insurance coverage in the population as a whole, Sprigg said.\n \n \"But I would hope they would look at the serious health concerns associated with homosexuality and make a decision based on actual health considerations, not just on financial considerations,\" Sprigg said.\n \n On homosexual parenting, studies have shown that children of female same-sex parents are less likely to conform to traditional gender roles, are more likely to engage in homosexual relations themselves and are more sexually adventurous, Sprigg said.\n \n A recent Australian study comparing children raised by married couples, children raised by cohabiting heterosexual couples and children raised by homosexual couples found that in nine of 13 categories - mostly involving social adjustment and academic achievement - children raised by married couples did best and children raised by same sex couples did worst, Sprigg said.\n \n \"And that's all besides the more general evidence showing the problems inherent in homosexual behavior in general, including higher levels of promiscuity, physical disease, mental illness, substance abuse, and domestic violence,\" he said. \n \n Dr. David Stevens, executive director of the Christian Medical Association, said the AAP statement would be used in legal custody battles to say that homosexual parenting is a good thing for children.\n \n \"We don't think the data supports that and ultimately the children are the ones that are going to be harmed,\" Stevens said. \"Pediatricians will take care of kids the same, but they are to advocate for children's welfare and unfortunately, I don't think this does.\"\n \n \n Children deserve to know that their relationships with both of their parents are stable and legally recognized. This applies to all children, whether their parents are of the same or opposite sex. The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes that a considerable body of professional literature provides evidence that children with parents who are homosexual can have the same advantages and the same expectations for health, adjustment, and development as can children whose parents are heterosexual.1-9 When 2 adults participate in parenting a child, they and the child deserve the serenity that comes with legal recognition.\n \n \n \n \n \"3. Why not marry my brother or cousin or a child? Beacause of the law. You are putting this into a stale black or white, you are either for hetero-only marriage, or against all restrictions on marriage, false dilemma context. My options are not limited to two(you are either for me or against me) choices simply because you suggest they are. I can support hetero marriage and also support same-sex marriage, as I do. Because I do not support hetero-only marriage, I believe you are suggesting I must support totally dismantling all restrictions on marriage, making it meaningless. That is not true.\"\n \n It is also against the law for homosexuals to marry, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. What I am saying is that marriage is becoming something that is no longer sacred. Anyone can make a case that they should be able to marry children, animals, or family members using the same logic that homosexuals are using to say that they should be married.\n \n And for the justices that voted in mass. that the state has to rewrite their marriage law...\n the justices said that it was \"unconstitutional\", that is the state constitution, for the state not to allow them to marry. When the Massachusetts constitution was written homosexuals could be killed for being gay, so i don't know how they drew that conclusion.",

(presented here on a very biased web site none the less.)\n \n http://www.familyfirst.org/capitolwatch/0402.pdf \n \n Again, not a true study. This is an article in an obviously biased periodical which presents \"snippits\" of figures and variables from other studies. It does not show the complete studies, only variables that seem to support their opinions. This does not qualify as a reliable source.\n \n http://headlines.agapepress.org/arc...afa/302003a.asp \n \n Strangely, just as I thought, your last link is from yet another completely biased article from a biased periodical. It also is not a study. It points to various other studies, but does not show any of them completely and fairly. This article is again mostly opinion. As a matter of fact, it also points to the inadequacy and faults of current studies on the subject of homosexual adoption. \n \n Perhaps I was not clear when I asked you to link studies supporting your statements. I did not mean editorial articles, opinions, or biased articles from anti-gay and pro-nuclear family organization publications. I am asking for CLEAR, SCIENTIFIC, NON-BIASED studies.  \n \n \nThe sanctity of marriage is marriage between one man and one woman.\n \n \n In other words, what the church percieves to be \"normal\", or what has been the accepted practice through history? Slavery was an accepted practice for a long time in this country, did A. Lincoln violate the sanctity of this institution? The sanctity of marriage to me is the love of 2 people for each other, and their willingness to devote themselves completely to one another. It has nothing to do with their genders. But perhaps the words \"sanctity of marriage\" are subjective. \n \n \nWhat if the age of consent is changed? Some organizations have brought lawsuits to change the age of consent, to as low as 8.\n \n \n In that case, in the eyes of the law it would not be wrong. We all know that this will not happen. The current age of consent was established due to a consensus among scientific and religious communities that this is the age when a person is capable of making informed decisions on their own. I don't think you will find too many people who will say that an 8 y/o is capable of making informed decisions about everything, especially relationships. While many people will intellectually become adults prior to reaching their 18th birthday, many others will not reach this level of maturity for several years after they reach 18. The idea of using 18 as the age when someone becomes an adult is based on an average, and while not a perfect system, it is the best system we have.",

However, there is no evidence at present to substantiate a biologic theory ... Critical review shows the evidence favoring a biologic theory to be lacking.\" [W. Byne M.D., Ph.D., B. Parsons, M.D., Ph.D. (1993), Human Sexual Orientation: The Biologic Theories Reappraised, Archives of General Psychiatry, p. 228]\n \n After reviewing the scientific studies on genetics and homosexuality, Masters and Johnson concluded: \"The genetic theory of homosexuality has been generally discarded today.\" [W.H. Masters, V.E. Johnson, R.C. Kolodny (1985) Human Sexuality, 2nd Ed., p. 411-412, Little, Brown and Company: Boston]\n \n Dr. C.A. Tripp summarizes the scientific experience regarding hormones and homosexuality as follows:\n \"... A number of clinicians have seen fit over the years to run their own experiments by administering testosterone to both effeminate and ordinary homosexuals. The results have been consistent: When there were any behavioral changes at all, the subjects became more like themselves than ever. Their sex drives were usually increased and sometimes their effeminate mannerisms as well (when they had any), but there were never any directional changes in their sexual interests. From these experiments ... it has become abundantly clear that the sex hormones play a considerable role in powering human sexuality, but they do not control the direction of it.\" [C.A. Trip (1975) The Homosexual Matrix, p. 12, McGraw-Hill: New York]\n \n \"The available data ... suggest that sexual orientation ... is base on social learning rather than hormones.\" [idem]\n Dr. Judd Marmor reported on the work of Richard Green who, \"... in a long series of studies on boys who showed effeminate behavior in childhood has demonstrated that although over half of these boys do become homosexual, a substantial minority of them do not. This indicates that gender-discordant children are not born homosexual, but rather are born with certain behavioral tendencies that, given contributory environmental factors, can predispose them towards homosexual behavior. Thus, a little boy whose behavior is effeminate, who does not like competitive athletics, and who prefers music and art, may be disappointing to a macho father, who tends to reject the boy and distance himself from him. The mother may respond by overprotecting her son. Such reactions disturb the boy's capacity to identify positively with his father and cause him to over identify with his mother. He may then ultimately develop homosexual erotic responses which are reinforced by later experiences.\" [J. Marmor, \"Homosexuality: Nature versus Nurture,\" The Harvard Mental Health Letter, October 1985, p. 6]\n \n John Money says, \"With respect to orientation as homosexual or bisexual, there is no human evidence that prenatal hormonalization alone, independently of postnatal history, inexorably preordains either orientation. Rather, neonatal antecedents may facilitate a homosexual or bisexual orientation, provided the postnatal determinants in the social and communicational history are also facilitative.\" [J. Money (1987), \"Sin, Sickness or Status? Homosexual Gender Identity and Psychoneuroendocrinology,\" American Psychologist, 42, No. 4 (April), p. 398]\n \n Dr. Earl D. Wilson writes, \"The disputed evidence for physical causes of male homosexuality is even weaker when it comes to lesbianism.\" [E.D. Wilson (1988) Counseling and Homosexuality, p. 76, Word Books: Waco, TX] \n \n Facts like these led John DeCecco, editor of the Journal of Homosexuality and professor of psychology at San Francisco State University to say, \"'The idea that people are born into one type of sexual behavior is foolish.' ... The move towards 'biologizing' homosexuality, he says, isn't the result of a scientific consensus, but a political consensus by those eager to label people gay or straight. Homosexuality, he says, is a 'behavior, not a condition,' and something that some people can and do change, just like they sometimes change tastes and other personality traits.\" [K. Painter, (March 1, 1989), A Biologic Theory for Sexual Preference, USA Today p. 4D]",

   "The purpose of this pamphlet is to dispel myths and promote understanding about the nature of homosexuality. No one is born homosexual. There is no scientific data to substantiate a genetic or biological basis for same-sex attractions. Homosexuality is not an identity. It is a behavior. Therefore, anyone can choose to change and become straight. The notion of \"born gay\" and \"cannot change\" has no factual basis. It was concocted of unsubstantiated \"science\" and perpetuated by political activists as a most successful means of soliciting public support. Further, the term \"homosexual\" is not a noun. It is an adjective. Rather than referring to someone, it describes an individual's thoughts, feelings, desires, and behavior.\n \n \n Sure, any article that starts out like this is surely not biased. Again, great sources. The other 2 are just as laughable as the first ones you posted. The Family Research Institute & NARTH (National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality). Wonderfully non-biased sources my friend. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nIf you read my links, you will find studies that point out that homosexuals molest children many times more then heterosexuals.\n \n \n I have looked at the links, and there are no published studies there. Do you know what a true study looks like? Not an article on an anti-homosexual rag, I mean a real study.\n \n Here is a real study for you.\n http://www.ncjrs.org/pdffiles/163390.pdf \n \n \n As for the rest of your quotes you provided, The newest one is 10 years old. The one that is 10 years old, is nothing more than a quote from one individual, I can find you 5 quotes that say the opposite. Look, I respect your opinion, and I enjoy the debate, but if you want to make your claims, and then present bogus quotes and information, skip it.
