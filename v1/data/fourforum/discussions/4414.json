   "This discussion started on a prior thread (evolving religion), but it seemed interesting enough to warrant its own topic, so here goes. I posit that there is no such thing as Absolute Truth.\n \n Since the discussion up until now has been sorely lacking for a hard definition of the word, here's how \"truth\" is defined at dictionary.com - there's one phrase that seems to be what we're looking for:\n \n Truth:\n \"That which is considered to be the supreme reality and to have the ultimate meaning and value of existence.\"\n \n Let's deconstruct that sentence, starting with \"supreme reality.\" Is there such a thing? Yes, in that there is an objective universe that consists of physical objects and laws that exists outside of our perceptions of it. Your brain gives you your own reality; a muddied, filtered version of the external one for you to interact with. A change in our internal reality doesn't change the objective world itself. A color-blind view of an apple won't change the way that light strikes the surface and releases photons in a specific manner.\n \n Next part of the sentence: \"ultimate meaning.\" Meaning is something that is constructed in our own internal realities, which we've established is separate from the \"supreme reality\" of the objective world outside us. There is no meaning to an apple, to a horse or a skyscraper. They simply are. Our brains, which are hardwired to draw connections, examine relationships between objects and assign meanings which will help us relate to those around us and successfully raise another generation of humans. If there is an \"ultimate meaning\" that all humans can agree on (yeah, right), it still would have no actual connection to the physical universe.\n \n \"Value of existence.\" Same as \"ultimate meaning.\" Value, used this way, is an internal concept. The 9/11 hijackers valued their existence much differently than the citizens they condemned valued theirs. \n \n So, given that Meaning and Value, which comprise Truth as defined above, exist only in our internal realities, which don't have any effect on the objective universe around us, it follows that there is no Absolute Truth.\n \n Finally, stating that \"there is no absolute truth\" is not just stating another absolute truth. Truth, as we've established, is a human construct, and our argument has nothing to say about Meaning and Value.\n \n \n This is the hardest I've squeezed my brain in a while...whew...",

   "I may have to check out the discussions in the philosophy forums, but here's my take...\n \n There is at least one set of absolute truths that we can determine, regardless of the universe being discussed -- tautological statements. In other words, whatever is --< IS.\n \n However, by the definition of truth that you put forth, tautologies appear not to apply because they offer no ultimate meaning.",

   "Hadn't thought of that one, but I'm not sure it negates the argument. Your phrase, \"whatever is --< IS\" could be restated as \"whatever is, IS because of the natural processess that led to its being.\" Like you said, there is no truth in here according to our definition, so we're safe.\n \n If you want to talk about tautological statements, here's one: \"What is Truth? Truth is God. What is God? God is Truth.\" I think this is at the heart of any religious arguments for Absolute Truth, and its also why they're bound to fail. But maybe someone will prove me wrong here.",

   "Since I've been having this same discussion in the philosophy forum, I'll just quote from a couple recent posts there...\n \n \nYour deconstruction of that particular definition is interesting. It does not deny that stating \"there is no absolute truth\" is indeed an absolute truth. It equivocates the meaning as stated. An absolute truth is something that is always true. Absolute meaning without exception. Truth meaning the lining up of what is real with what is stated. Something is either true or false. Truth is not a construct. The expression of truth may be a construct (I say may be) but something is either true or false. To say nothing is ever true is a fallacy. It is like saying \"everything I say is a lie\". It is a fallacious argument.\n\n \n \nThanks for your comments. \"Truth\", as you use it here, could be defined as \"being correct.\" Here I agree with you in that something could be either true/correct or false/incorrect. That the earth is a sphere is true. That it is a cube is false. \n \n The type of truth you address is \"one's perceptions of a thing being in line with the objective reality of the thing.\" The other definition, which I tried to debunk, is that there is an objective meaning assigned to that thing, which when we possess it we have \"the Truth\" (big \"T\") of that object. It's really meant to counter a religious argument, made by people who think they have the Truth. \n \n I think we're both still correct here about our different definitions. They meet in the statement \"there's no absolute Truth.\" If I'm right and there is no fundamental meaning to objects, and Truth depends on meaning (my definition), then there is no Truth for any one person or group to possess. If that statement matches up with the reality of the universe (your definition), then it is the truth.\n \n\n \n When I say that there is no Truth (by which I'm mean Trebor's philosophical and moral Truth) in the universe, I am stating an absence of Truth, not another Truth in its place.",
