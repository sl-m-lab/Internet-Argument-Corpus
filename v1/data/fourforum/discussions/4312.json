I agree that a church is a building, except that it also is \"the Lord's house\" and a gathering place of worship for the literal \"church\" body. So even though I am a christian, I wouldn't agree with making it the place for a public school graduation. I wonder why the location has been changed? Maybe it has more to do with budget than anything else.",

   "It is indeed a public school. The reason they changed was one year we couldn't get the original place so we looked around and last minute found a church who would let us use it for free. It also seats about 500 more people so everyone along with their whole family can come. I really don't care but I can also see where people might take offense since there are probably crosses and other religious symbols/words (I haven't seen the place, I'm only a sophomore :()",

   "To zachvac:\n \n Do you think this violates the separation of church and state? There has been a big debate over that and I wanted to know what other people thought.\n \n It's kind of interesting that the separation of church and state concept has been radically changed in the past 100 years especially.\n \n The First Amendment simply states:\n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise therefor.\n \n Over the years, however, the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have reinterpreted this amendment in many ways. This reinterpretation of the Constitution has in effect become the \"law\" supposedly dictating the \"separation of church and state.\"\n \n Let's look first at a very brief history of the Courts reasoning and rationale for reinterpretation, and then we'll discuss what the phrase \"separation of church and state\" means as it is applied in American public policy.\n \n One of the Supreme Court's most blatant violations of the Constitution came about through their reinterpretation of the Bill of Rights - the first ten amendments. Prior to this constitutional violation, the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government. Notice the actual language of the First Amendment: \"Congress shall make no law. . .\"\n \n As one of many efforts to limit the power of the federal government, the Constitution left authority over religious matters to the States. The Supreme Court consistently adhered to this constitutional principle until well into the twentieth century.\n \n But in the 1925 ruling, Gitlow v. New York, the Supreme Court began ignoring its predecessors and precedents. The Court reasoned that one of the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment was to extend the Bill of Rights to the States. (This would obviously expand the powers of the federal courts to a great degree.) The history of the Fourteenth Amendment does not support their contention, nor do the earlier Courts.\n \n Nonetheless, the 1925 Court ignored the historical record and the opinions of their predecessors, establishing a new precedent. Gitlow dealt with freedom of speech and the press; religious matters would soon follow.\n \n In the context of religion, the Court's first and most abusive reinterpretation began in a 1940 Supreme Court ruling, Cantwell v. Connecticut. Here, the Court applied the \"free exercise\" clause of the First Amendment to the states. Again, religion was a State matter. State courts were, and are, completely capable of handling the issue. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court, in direct opposition to the original intentions of the Constitution, applied yet another portion of the Bill of Rights to the States. They did not stop there.\n \n The next landmark ruling came down in 1947. In the case, Everson v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court applied the \"establishment clause\" of the First Amendment to the states. In the context of the \"separation of church and state,\" the Court's foundational reinterpretation of the Constitution was complete. From 1947 forward, the Court has ruled with regularity on religious issues, in direct violation of the original meaning of the First Amendment. Their rulings, and those of lower courts (federal and State) have become the \"law\" of \"separation of church and state.\"\n \n That was a very brief description of how the federal courts have taken authority over religious issues, reinterpreting the First Amendment and applying it to the States by way of the Fourteenth Amendment. All of this was done in clear violation of the actual wording of the Constitution, as well as the intentions of its framers. The modern concept of \"separation of church and state\" can not be justified using the historical record.\n \n The First Amendment, which prohibited any \"law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" has evolved into something entirely new. During the last generation, the courts, at all levels, have ruled in ways that essentially guarantee the freedom from religion, instead of the freedom of religion.\n \n \"Separation of church and state,\" as applied to education, means that a prayer at a graduation ceremony is unconstitutional (due to the purposefully ignorant reinterpretation of the Supreme Courts). It also means that students may not pause for a moment of silence at the beginning of their school day. It means that a nativity scene may not be displayed on public property unless there are other displays (e.g. Santa Clause or Christmas trees) that secularize the presentation. Notice the replacement of Christianity with secular humanism, i.e. children are still being taught religion, only this one is humanism with it's evolutionary rationale.\n \n Today's conception of \"separation of church and state\" has also been used to remove historic crosses from public property, and religious symbols from city seals. It has been used to remove the Ten Commandments from courtrooms, even though they are carved in stone within the architecture of the Supreme Court building. The concept has been used to prevent religious expressions on personalized license plates. And these are but a few of the official applications of the concept, or \"law\" of \"separation of church and state.\"\n \n One should understand that \"separation of church and state\" is not actually a law. It is a doctrine, or a legal concept, that has been implemented by the various courts primarily over the last fifty years. If this concept, as originally understood, would have been applied with consistency over the years, America would certainly be a different country right now. Religious expression would flourish, and the courts would not be micromanaging the religious life of the American people.\n \n The doctrine of \"separation of church and state\" has been used, and is being used, to effectively purge religion (notably Christianity) from the public square. The historical perspective on church/state issues reveals a much different story. The government was to accommodate the religious communities; religion and religious expression were to be encouraged.\n \n It seems pretty clear that all that the education system in America, and even here in Australia (although not to the same extent), have done is replace one religion with another, i.e. they have replaced Christianity (including the face-value reading of Genesis) with secular humanism and it's evolutionary rationale.\n \n I honestly don't see how your example has anything to do with 'separation of church and state'. Even working with today's radically changed reinterpretation of the First Amendment, the children are not being taught anything about Christianity. Although I'm not sure that the church is the right place for hosting graduation as it is more a place for worship and other related activites, such as marriage (one man for one woman - setup in Genesis when God made Eve from Adam's side, hence the 'oneness' part of marriage, i.e. one man for one woman for life).",

I don't think they meant that the ammendments only applied to the federal government, do you?\n \n\n In the context of religion, the Court's first and most abusive reinterpretation began in a 1940 Supreme Court ruling, Cantwell v.

Their rulings, and those of lower courts (federal and State) have become the \"law\" of \"separation of church and state.\"\n \n\n As I have said before, I definately think it applies to the states, but the question is does the first ammendment imply separation of church and state? I think it does because it may not make a single law respecting an establishment of religion. The one place where we will probably disagree is that I think it didn't only mean laws, but actions. I believe that the government shouldn't have anything to do with churches, which is where the separation of church and state concept comes in.\n \n \n \n\n That was a very brief description of how the federal courts have taken authority over religious issues, reinterpreting the First Amendment and applying it to the States by way of the Fourteenth Amendment. All of this was done in clear violation of the actual wording of the Constitution, as well as the intentions of its framers. The modern concept of \"separation of church and state\" can not be justified using the historical record.\n \n\n So did the framers publish another document, \"What we really meant when we wrote the Constitution\"? No one knows what they meant but we can guess, and that's the job of the supreme court.\n \n \n\n The First Amendment, which prohibited any \"law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" has evolved into something entirely new. During the last generation, the courts, at all levels, have ruled in ways that essentially guarantee the freedom from religion, instead of the freedom of religion.\n \n\n Nice little slogan there that it doesn't guarentee freedom from religion, but since atheism is a religion, I have the right to believe atheism. Religion is the beliefs people have relating to dieties or a diety and what happens after death.\n \n \n\n \"Separation of church and state,\" as applied to education, means that a prayer at a graduation ceremony is unconstitutional (due to the purposefully ignorant reinterpretation of the Supreme Courts).\n \n\n I agree with this and it's true. Of course if one person wants to pray privately at the ceremony that's fine.\n \n \n \n\n It also means that students may not pause for a moment of silence at the beginning of their school day. \n \n\n That is totally false. Unless the teacher is teaching and you are ignoring them, you can have as long as you want of silence.",
