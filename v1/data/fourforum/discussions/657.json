I was first going to do women's sufferage as my topic but when I came across Tibet I decided to give it a shot.\n \n I wanted to know how much you guys know about Tibet and if you think what is going on now is wrong or right? Do you think the USA should step in and help a little more then they are doing? It's been like 50 years and nothing has happened but millions of deaths!!",
