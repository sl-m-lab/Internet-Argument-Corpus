   " UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Alone among major Western nations, the United States has refused to sign a declaration presented Thursday at the United Nations calling for worldwide decriminalization of homosexuality.\n \n In all, 66 of the U.N.'s 192 member countries signed the nonbinding declaration - which backers called a historic step to push the General Assembly to deal more forthrightly with any-gay discrimination. More than 70 U.N. members outlaw homosexuality, and in several of them homosexual acts can be punished by execution.\n \n Co-sponsored by France and the Netherlands, the declaration was signed by all 27 European Union members, as well as Japan, Australia, Mexico and three dozen other countries. There was broad opposition from Muslim nations, and the United States refused to sign, indicating that some parts of the declaration raised legal questions that needed further review.\n \n \"It's disappointing,\" said Rama Yade, France's human rights minister, of the U.S. position - which she described as in contradiction with America's long tradition as a defender of human rights.\n \n According to some of the declaration's backers, U.S. officials expressed concern in private talks that some parts of the declaration might be problematic in committing the federal government on matters that fall under state jurisdiction. In numerous states, landlords and private employers are allowed to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation; on the federal level, gays are not allowed to serve openly in the military.\n \n Carolyn Vadino, a spokeswoman for the U.S. mission to the U.N., stressed that the United States - despite its unwillingness to sign - condemned any human rights violations related to sexual orientation.\n \n Gay rights activists nonetheless were angered by the U.S. position.\n \n \"It's an appalling stance - to not join with other countries that are standing up and calling for decriminalization of homosexuality,\" said Paula Ettelbrick, executive director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.\n \n She expressed hope that the U.S. position might change after President-elect Barack Obama takes office in January.\n \n Also denouncing the U.S. stance was Richard Grenell, who until two months ago had been the chief spokesman for the U.S. mission to the U.N.\n \n \"It is ridiculous to suggest that there are legal reasons why we can't support this resolution - common sense says we should be the leader in making sure other governments are granting more freedoms for their people, not less,\" said Grenell, who described himself as a gay Republican. \"The U.S. lack of support on this issue only dims our once bright beacon of hope and freedom for those who are persecuted and oppressed.\"\n News from The Associated Press\n \n I can't help but wonder if people stand up and LOOK at who is in the \"for\" and who is in the \"against\" group on this.\n Western civilized world? Predominantly FOR decriminalization of homosexuals.\n And who is in the U.S. corner opposing this? Muslim countries.\n \n Furthermore, if this were put to a vote for a democratic representation of U.S. opinion, I bet dollars to doughnuts it WOULD PASS and we WOULD SUPPORT this bill.",
