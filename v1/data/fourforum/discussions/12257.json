To ascertain this, the earliest civilization of antiquity will be examined to determine its localization and the time of its emergence.\n \n The threshold of history appears to be located in the area of the present-day nation of Iraq. Albright writes:\n \n Archaeological research has established that there is no focus of civilization in the earth that can begin to compete in antiquity and activity with the basin of the Eastern Mediterranean and the region immediately to the east of it . . . The Obeidan is the earliest clearly defined culture of Babylonia, where we find its remains underlying nearly all the oldest cities of the country, such as Ur, Erech, Lagash, Eridu, etc. This proves that the occupation of the marshlands of Babylonia by human settlers cam rather late in history of the irrigation culture, probably not far from 3700 B.C.\n \n Thus, the archaeological evidence shows that the location of the first civilization after the flood was in the Mesopotamia Valley, and this agrees exactly with the Bible, for it reports the first cities were Babylon, Erech, Nineveh, etc. (Gen. 10:10-11).\n The date 3700 B.C. suggested by Albright is apparently satisfactory to most archeologists. M.B. Rowton writes that in Uruk, one of the most ancient Mesopotamia sites, the earliest level of monumental buildings is that of the level know as Uruk V. He concludes,10 \"the beginning of Uruk V can plausibly be dated 3500 B.C.\" The date 3500 or 3700 B.C. are estimates arrived at by starting at a more clearly defined historical point and allowing a reasonable period of time for each level of occupation prior to this. Thus, the archaeological evidence appears to indicate that prior to about 3700 B.C., there was no substantial culture anywhere in the world. About 3700-3500 B.C. the first great civilization began to\n The Biblical Calendar of History\n PAGE 8\n be formed in the plains of Sumer in the land of Babylon, Erech, Ur, etc.\n How does this time compare with the Biblical chronology? In Genesis 10 the notice is given that the first building activity after the flood is that of Nimrod, the beginning of whose kingdom was Babel, Erech, and Accad, all of them in the land of Shinar (Gen 10:10). When did Nimrod come upon the scene? His genealogical descent is that of Noah, Ham, Cush, Nimrod (Gen. 10:1, 6, 8). The Bible offers no timetable for this side of the family tree, but it does offer precise information regarding the genealogical statements of the Bible, it might be noted that very often two branches of the tree are offered. One is that of the descendants leading eventually to Christ and about which precise timetables are given, as we have seen. The second is the genealogical descent of that side of the family which turned away from God. It can be shown that the timetable of these two lines run roughly parallel.\n It may be assumed that Ham and Shem were contemporaries (they obviously were, inasmuch as they were brothers), that Arpachshad and Cush were nearly contemporaries, and that Shelah and Nimrod were probably men of the same period of history. Thus, if Shelah&#8217;s date is known, it may be surmised that Nimrod&#8217;s was close to the same date.\n Shelah&#8217;s date by Biblical reckoning was 4050 B.C. to 3617 B.C. Nimrod must have lived about this time. Thus, the Bible suggests a date of about 3900 B.C. to 3617 B.C. for the founding of the great cities of the Mesopotamia Valley. The date suggested by the evidence of archaeology (3700-3500 B.C.) accords very well with the Biblical statement.\n It is more than passing interest in this connection that the name \"Nimrod\" has left its mark on the Mesopotamia Valley. The great archaeologist George Rawlinson writes:12\n The remarkable ruin generally called Ahkerhuf, which lies a little to the southwest of Baghdad, is known to many as the \"Tel-Nimrod;\" the great dam across the Tigris below Mosul is the \"Suhr-el-Nimrud;\" one of the chief of the buried cities in the same neighborhood is called \"Nimrud\" simply; and the name of \"Birs-Nimrud\" attaches to the grandest mass of ruins in the lower country.\n \n The Confusion of Tongues \n \n Another piece of history that should be interesting to investigate is the Tower of Babel. Is there any secular evidence that relates to the ac-\n The Biblical Calendar of History\n PAGE 9\n count of the confusion of tongues as set forth in Genesis 11? There is, indeed.\n The Genesis 11 account indicates that prior to this time in history, all men spoke one language. Moreover, the leading civilization was that of the people who dwelt in the plains of Shinar or Sumer. Their desire to be the one great civilization of the world prompted the building of the tower, which in turn brought God&#8217;s interference with their plans so that they were forced to separate into various nations.\n As has already been shown, the first great civilization of the world as revealed by secular evidence was that which sprang forth in the Mesopotamia Valley. The time of the beginning of the second important civilization of antiquity could be of real significance. Presumably, it would have begun shortly after the Tower of Babel. The events concerning the Tower of Babel are known to have occurred during the generation of Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided (Gen. 10:25). Peleg&#8217;s generation was from 3153 B.C. to 2914 B.C. Therefore, one would expect no important civilizations other than Babylonia to have an antiquity greater than about 3150 B.C.\n \n Egypt Becomes a Great Civilization\n \n All archaeological evidence points to Egypt as the second great civilization to appear. While there was a primitive culture in Egypt prior to the First Dynasty, the uniting of all of Egypt under the Pharaoh Menes to form the First Dynasty was the signal for a major burst in the arts of civilization. Albright writes:13\n \n It is now certain that the level of Egyptian culture remained considerably below that of Mesopotamia until the first Dynasty, when under strong indirect influence from the Euphrates Valley, it forged ahead of the latter in a breathtaking spurt.\n \n Interestingly, the new civilization of Egypt beginning with the First Dynasty was patterned after the Babylonian (Mesopotamian) culture. Albright continues:14\n \n The close of the Predynastic Age and the beginning of the Thinite (period of first two centuries) Period witnessed a sudden burst in the arts of civilization. This seems to have been connected in some way with an increase of cultural influence from Asia, since\n \n The Biblical Calendar of History\n PAGE 10\n there are numerous exact parallels between Mesopotamia and Egyptian culture at this time, the former being demonstrably older and more original in nearly every instance.\n \n The date of the beginning of the First Dynasty under Menes is calculated to be somewhere between 2800 B.C. and 3100 B.C. The early archaeologists such as Breasted dated his reign at about 3400 B.C. As new archaeological evidence was uncovered, this date was moved forward to about 3000 B.C. Albright believe 2850 B.C. is a good estimate.15 William C. Hayes suggests 3100 B.C. is the best date presently available.16\n Considering the above information, one is struck by the fact that prior to about 3100 B.C. to 2850 B.C., only one civilization of consequence existed in the world. That was the nation of Babylonia on the plains of Shinar. Then at that time, in a sudden burst of progress, Egypt grew to become a second great civilization, a civilization patterned after the first. These dates are in almost exact agreement with the Biblical date for the Tower of Babel. Surely the confusion of tongues as recorded in Genesis 11 sent thousands of people skilled in all the arts and crafts of Mesopotamia to Egypt and elsewhere. Thus, accord can be seen between the sacred and the secular records by this indirect evidence of the timetable of the civilizations of antiquity.\n \n Writing and the Tower of Babel\n \n It might be noted that writing had its beginning in Mesopotamia and may be related to the confusion of tongues. Sir Leonard Wooley writes:17\n \n All the archaeological evidence seems to prove that true writing was first developed in southern Mesopotamia.\n \n The timing for this event is given as 3500 B.C. to 3000 B.C. Gelb concludes:18\n \n The date of the earliest Sumerian writing should be set tentatively at about 3100 B.C.\n \n The confusion of tongues in Sumer some time in the period between 3150-2900 B.C. could have been the catalyst that produced writing. Before this dramatic civilization-splitting event, all was secure. Only one language was spoken in all the world. Verbal communication was ad-\n The Biblical Calendar of History\n PAGE 11\n equate and dependable. But then came the fearful event that shook the very foundations of this great civilization; and men could no longer understand each other. They wanted to find a better way. The application of the spoken word to clay tablets would provide insurance that this kind of happening would never again totally destroy a culture. The clay tablets would prove to be a reference point. One surely can see the possibility if not the probability of this connection between writing and the Tower of Babel.\n \n Conclusion\n \n Thus, we see that the chronology of history established by Biblical reckoning agrees rather satisfactorily with the archaeological evidence of the earliest civilizations. The Biblical timetable is, of course, the most reliable, for it is God&#8217;s Word. If we have properly interpreted it, it should make possible a far more definitive analysis of the secular evidence than ever before. It should also provide a dependable framework in which to understand dating evidence such as that offered by radiometric isotopes like carbon 14.\n Hopefully, a perspective of history has been set forth that shows that answers are potentially forthcoming when we begin with the Biblical framework. The concept of a 13,000-year-old world, which began to be repopulated after the flood some 7,000 years ago, and which 1,500 years later had grown to a point that allowed the spawning of the first great cities, surely makes much more sense than the idea that mankind has been around for hundreds or even thousands of millenniums, and then became a cohesive city civilization only in the last 5,500 years. Furthermore, the apparent possibility of the end of the age occurring in our time also accords far better with the shorter timetable.The Biblical Calendar of History",

   "There are several problems with this debate. Goliath's height was six cubits and a span. A cubit was the length from the elbow to the fingertip and it varied from one person to another and from one culture to another. A typical 6 foot tall person has a cubit (1/4 of height) of 1 1/2 feet. Six cubits is 9 feet. Sumerians had a cubit slightly longer (19 or 20 inches) A tribe with men averaging 5 feet tall would have a cubit of 1 1/4 feet. Thus Goliath would have been 7 1/2 feet tall. He could have been a perfectly normal giant with none of the health problems that come from a pituitary abnormality. This leaves us with an interpretation of the Bible that does not contradict science.\n The second problematical interpretation is that all men died in the flood. The word for World in Gen 6 & 7 is also translated region or country. In Peter, he refers to the creation of the world and the final destruction of the world with the word \"Ge.\" He refers to the destruction of the world by the flood with the word cosmos.

   "I don't want to be accused of \"cross posting\" again, but I have said it before.\n Genesis doesn't seem \"contradictory\" at all if it is read as the metaphorical work of literature that it was originally written as (see: www.songofgenesis.org) \n The Noah story is very similar to the \"Gilgamesh\" epic poem, for instance.\n I think all these stories have an important message, however, that message becomes difficult to discern when perceptions of its context are so divergent.",

   "1 Sam 17:4 Goliath from Gath\n 1 Chron 20:5 Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite (from Gath)\n 1 Chron 20:8 These were descendants of Rapha (rapha is translated giant in the King James. It has the idea of vigorous from the word meaning cured.)\n Num 13:33 connects Nephilim (Gen 6:4) with Anakim or Anakites or children of Anak - depends on translation, all same thing. Caleb drives out these three Anakim Josh 15:14 from Hebron\n Deut 2:11 Emites are like Anakim and both descendants of Rapha (Raphaites)\n Josh 11:21 Josh destroyed the Anakites from the hill country. :22 Only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did any survive.\n Yes, it is convoluted and uses some obscure verses, but it seems to connect Goliath with the Nephilim. None of the Hebrew words needs to be translated Giant, but the description of the weapons indicates huge (7'+) strong men. King Saul was a head taller than the Israelites (1 Sam 9:2) and he was totally terrified of Goliath (1 Sam 17:11)\n Now, to be honest, 2 Sam says Goliath the Gittite was a different person, but some think that the original contained the words \"Lahmi brother of\" as preserved in I Chron 20:5",

   "I followed the literal evidence to see where it would take me. First, 450 foot wooden boats are impossible, especially in a flood. The Bible says it was a 450 foot reed boat/raft, perfectly possible. (see Thor Heyerdahl's The Tigris Expedition) Then there is only one type of flood that can last for 1 year and three months and then recede, a marsh flood. A variety of Biblical evidence said that the flood could be a regional flood, and that the region was the civilized world. The only civilization about 3,000 BC was Sumer, which was on a marsh. This was before Sumerians started building large Ziggurats. The animals on the Ark would have been the domestic animals specially adapted to the Sumerian region and the wild marsh animals. The mountain he landed on could have been one of the protoziggurats. The reed boat, the regional flood and the timing are based on solid Biblical evidence. Which animals and where he landed are reasonable speculations based on the other evidence, but just that, my speculations.",
