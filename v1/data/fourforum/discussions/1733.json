   "What do you guys think of a tax credit system for businesses that achieve certain environmental goals (e.g. 25% reduction in hazardous waste generation, 15% reduction in total solid waste generation, etc.)? \n \n Assume that the tax credit system is for state and local taxes. Assume that the average business pay a combined state/local tax rate of 7%.\n \n Is the tax credit idea good or bad?",

Most environmentally friendly tech is actually more efficient and its merely the high overhead that deters companies from installing it. After this has been done and the company has returned to its previous state of profitability, the tax reduction should be removed.\n \n In summary, I think its a bad idea, because once instated it will be difficult to remove.",

In this manner, the only way they can continue receiving the tax credit is to continously find ways to reduce waste generation.",

   "An interesting proposal. I still believe that it would be extremely difficult to remove after it has achieved its desired effect. \n \n I think that a reverse method would be more effective and result in a greater transition towards more environmentally friendly methods. \n \n Rather than give them incentive through tax cuts, increase taxes for those companies that do not meet the regulations guide line. It achieves the same result without causing the government to have a decrease in available tax dollars for the budget.",

It achieves the same result without causing the government to have a decrease in available tax dollars for the budget.\n\n \n Actually, increasing taxes for those companies that don't meet regulations wouldn't work. Any company that do not meet regulations is violating the law and are fined and ordered to do any cleanup (if necessary), in addition to being ordered to comply with regs. Double penalizing a business might not go well with the legislature. \n \n What was also considered other than tax incentives is to have a fee/tax system based on waste generation -- in the same manner as the gas tax. A significant portion of what Americans pay for gas goes to the federal, state, and local goverments as each add their own separate gas tax. Someone told me that about 80 cents per gallon goes to gas tax but I haven't bothered to look it up.\n \n In some juridictions, people pay a tax on solid waste, part of the tipping fee at landfills includes tax.\n \n To my knowledge, I do not believe there is a nationwide tax on solid waste, much less a tax on hazardous waste.\n \n However, raising taxes tend not to be a political favorite so likelihood of passing seems remote to me. But a tax incentive package may have a better chance of passing.\n \n The problems with a tax incentive package are (a) potential reduction in tax revenues and (b) the implemention a tax incentive package is considerably more difficult than simply raising taxes.",
