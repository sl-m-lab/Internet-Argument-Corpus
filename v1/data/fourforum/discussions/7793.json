   "Texas in The White House! It was a war cabinet from day one. Vice-president Dick Cheney was elder Bush's Secretary of Defense. Colin Powell was the big General in the Gulf War. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was an ex-wrestler who worked for Nixon and Ford. Television dug up footage from the Gulf War as soon as the Bush administration came in. For nearly 8 months, Bush's group had no purpose. After 9/11, it had all the purpose in the world. No one saw 9/11 coming. Blaming either party is absurd. Bin Laden and al Qaeda attacked all America. Any American could have been inside the Twin Towers of The World Trade Center on that day: Republican, Democrat, white, black or Hispanic. It was both an act of terror and the beginning of a crusade by Muslim extremists against Christians and Jews. George W. rose to the challenge. 9/11 changed him. He became a man of steel, a man of faith. He developed the same self-deprecating sense of humor that Reagan had. He appointed minorites. He proclaimed the civil rights of every American and freedom for all. He pledged to nominate qualified people to serve as judges. Bush views the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as part of a larger War on Terror. Saddam Hussein boasted he would fight and die in Baghdad. When Saddam was captured, he was found hiding in a hole like an animal. It is too easy to call him a coward. There are plenty of radical Muslims willing to die for their cause. Bush named an \"evil axis\" composed of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Iran is trying to enrich uranium while North Korea claims to have nuclear weapons. North Korea wants to talk to the United States one on one while Bush insists on multi-lateral talks involving 6 nations. It would be advantageous to do both. Democrats criticize Bush for going into Iraq and taking the focus off al Qaeda. Bin Laden is thought to be in the mountains near the Pakistan/Afghanistan border. He remains a threat because of his hatred for the United States and everything that smacks of civilization. Better intelligence is needed. It is imperative that terrorists not gain access to nuclear weapons. There is a down side to Bush 43 when it comes to domestic policies. He has gotten his way because of 9/11. Without a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, he might have been a one-termer like his father. Voters were reluctant to change during war time. Bush has implemented tax cuts for his oil buddies. He is the president of the rich. Education and science have suffered at the expense of religion. Still, Bush's speech about going to Mars coincided with a NASA plan to return to the moon by 2018 and to reach Mars by 2030. The price of gasoline has doubled under Bush. Never before has this happened from one president to the next. The Republican Congress has given oil companies the go ahead for drilling in Alaska's wildlife refuge, something we must do. Alternative energy sources are being researched. Bush wanted to privatize Social Security. To privatize Social Security would be to turn it into something else. Social Security is a government program stemming from the FDR era, a response to the Great Depression. It was not designed to be a pension fund. It was designed to be a safety net for the aged and disabled who are unable to take care of themselves. If Bush can appoint judges to the Supreme Court who will overturn Roe v. Wade, it will be a monumental achievement. 46 million babies have been aborted since 1973 in what has become an American Holocaust. John Roberts and Sam Alito can move us away from national suicide. George Bush spoke of a \"coalition of the willing\" when he invaded Iraq. This is in his favor. Saddam caused his own downfall. The United States has the right to defend itself as long as that defense is made by the willing. No one has been drafted and sent to Iraq. The soldiers there are volunteers. Their courage and loyalty to their country can not be questioned. It is a dangerous mission. As I write, there have been 2,316 Americans killed in Iraq. This is a high price. 40% approve of the way Bush is handling the war due to his recent speeches and the election of a permanent Iraqi Parliament. I empathize when he says it is his job to defend the American people. It is imperative that Americans stand together against an enemy who would destroy us all. George Bush insists on total victory. He is doing what he said he would. He has kept America safe after 9/11 and has brought democracy to Iraq. Al Qaeda and its terrorists had America surrounded. Bush distracted them by taking the fight to the desert. It was a standoff between the Bushes of Texas and the Husseins of Baghdad going back to the Gulf War of 1990-91. One family had to go down just as Roosevelt or Hitler had to go down in World War II. America is the leader of the free world and must rise to its destiny. 2004-05 was a test for Bush. He passed the test. He survived the Michael Moores, John Kerrys, Cindy Sheehans, Jane Fondas, Ted Kennedys and Harry Reids. History can only acknowledge George W. Bush's greatness and his legacy of freedom to all humankind. \n \n U.S. PRESIDENTS http://jimcolyer.com/papers/entry?id=50",
