   "this is a sad and sickening fact. its not that bush doesn't get it, its that the american people dont get it. bush knew from day 1 that he had no concrete evidence that there was anything threatening to our safety in iraq. he knew that there was no al qaeda links or anything like that. bush can laugh around at a comment like that because he doesnt need to act sincere and convince anyone anymore. america is already totally convinced that there is SOME really concern of national security that involves iraq. our soldiers refuse to believe that bush just used them because of a personal vendetta and his oil-coveting tendencies. but the truth is, thats really all this war was about\n \n its america who doesnt get it",

It was an official \"end\" to hostilities so that he could start handing out the rebuilding money to his buddies. It was a necessary formality to move on to the $ part.",
