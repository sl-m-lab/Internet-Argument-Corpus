Does anyone think that that guy who did it (I forget his name) should not be kicked out of the league permanantly?\n\n \n \n Hockey is a high speed physical game that averages 1 fight a game. While there is fighting there is usually a code. This code was obviously not followed when Todd Bertuzzi blind sided Steve Moore and rode him to the ice. I do not believe however that he intended to injure Moore but he let the emotions get the best of him. The Vancouver police department are persuing criminal charges which I agree with. This was a visous attack. Bertuzzi was suspended for the rest of the year plus the playoffs which will cost him $500,000 plus realisticly his teams chance at the Stanley Cup. Personally I am torn between wanting Bertuzzi banned and letting the NHL punishment stand. I think a better punishment would be suspension the lenght of Moores injury plus half a season.",

If Bertuzzi intended to break Moores neck, then yes, throw the book at him. But it is doubtful that Bertuzzi intended to injure Moore in such manner. In this case, I think intent is impossible to prove one way or another, unless Bertuzzi comes right out and says that he meant to break his neck. I think the league penatly should be Bertuzzi's punishment. In hockey, people take cheap shots all of the time, boarding and cross checking are commonplace. The perpetrators of these hits are given a 2 minute penalty usually, sometimes even when significant injury occurs. It is clear if you watch hockey as much as I do that some players throw these hits on other players with the intent to injure them, but they are not punished for it. Bertuzzi's biggest crime was that he did it after the whistle. I agree with Rev mostly, that he should be suspended the same number of games that Moore misses, pay a league fine if called for, and then be evaluated further to determine if he should be back on the ice, or sit out more games. This type of injury could have occured in any one of the thousands of other hits that occur every year, yet we do not persue action against the other players. The injury is really not the question, it is the question of timing. If Bertuzzi had hit him during play, he would have probably gone to the penalty box. His judgement was poor, and that is what he should pay for.",

They are sports, they are entertainment, and the boxers, hockey players, rugby players, football players, etc. go into them willingly to provide said entertainment. You say they should not be allowed...what did you mean by that? At all? On television? If you think they portray too much violence, don't watch them. Don't allow your children to watch them. But don't take away my outlets of entertainment because they offend your delicate senses. And also, are you suggesting that if these sport portrayed less violence they would be acceptable?

If you skate through the neutral zone with your head down you are risking injury and its you own fault. Scott Stevens has handed out how many concussions? (yeah he has one himself but he views it as part of the game which it is) lindros, kariya, Francis, Willis, etc.. they all fell victim to stevens legal hard hits and if you asked him he would say that the hits were part of the game. Injury is not the intent and he plays within the rules. Bertuzzi haymakered Moore from behind and rode him into the ice. I did find his body position of being on his elbows during the pile up as maybe he realized something was wrong but we will never know, His actions were outside of not only the rules but also \"the code\". if Bertuzzi was not intending to injure Moore he should have been suspended for stupidity and cowardace... Moore already had answered the bell that game If Moore did not want to fight he was more than in his rights under \"the code\" Poor judgment is different than agreed acceptence to risk or legal hits. \n \n \n Hockey is a very intense sport. Hard hits, fast plays, and emotions run high. That being said 99% of these players have no intention of hurting each other and the natural cycle of life dictates that an injury like this is needed to remind the players of exactly where that line is..",
