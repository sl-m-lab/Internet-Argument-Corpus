The founders actually conceived a much weaker executive in principle than those we've gotten in practice ever since FDR. So up to a point, I'm not even sure it would be entirely bad if Congress reasserted a bit more of its constitutional authority. The President is not a Prime Minister.\n\n \n True, but if they wanted to do their constitutional authority they wouldn't even have a stimulus package and would probably only need to be in session 3 months out of the year. \n \n So much for that!",
