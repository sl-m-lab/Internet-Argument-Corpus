Governmental control of the medical industry will be catastrophic.\n \n Why don't you have your friend move to Canada and try to get a transplant from within a single payer system such as you describe? Let me know how it turns out.\n \n I am not in agreement with all practices maintained in our current health system....such as hospitals charging the uninsured many times higher prices than the insured are charged. This is a ridiculous practice. If your friend's hospital wants $150,000.00 from him, they'd likely bill an insured person something like $30,000.00 for similar services related to the transplant. I have heard that the bills are sometimes FIVE TIMES higher for the uninsured.\n \n \n Socialized medicine is not going to solve the problem of the actual care being expensive. Under socialized medicine, the number of physicians will decrease as they are limited by the government and told who to treat, where they must work. The demand for services will increase and the supply of quality doctors will decrease. Fewer college students will go into medicine because their major incentive will have been removed. Many are in it for the money.\n \n Likely, we will still have the problem that the rich get served first because there will be graft and corruption within the government employees that handle who gets what. The rich will simply have to grease the right palms. The poor will still be last in line.\n \n The only benefit that socialized medicine will bring to this nation will be to those who love big government. Can you imagine how many more government employees we could have with a fully socialized health system? Who is going to pay these people? (Don't answer that...I know already.)\n \n If the government demands that no physicians practice privately, we may develope an illegal underground system where the best medical care is available on the black market only.\n \n I would rather have the government subsidize health insurance (with our tax monies) for those who cannot afford it rather than control the systems that treat them. \n \n Then there are those who can afford health insurance but choose not to purchase it. Do we force them to buy it?",

Your source claims that the average first year income for a GP is over 100K (in 2005). Mine says it is more like 26K for first year doctors (in 2008). Has it gone down or are we comparing two types of doctors here? Or are we comparing two sources, one of which is incorrect?\n \n Mine differentiates between government and private practice doctors.

   "The number of private GPs is vanishingly small. In any case my understanding is that the 106k figure is based on the new NHS contracts that have seen GP pay double in the last few years. Private doctors would not be subject to these contracts. The figures on the website you link to are based on a tiny sample (look at the numbers in brackets), and despite the claim to have been updated on the 4/2/08 (I'm assuming that's US dating) I suspect that this is because the most recent piece of data was added then, rather than all the data. It's a self selecting group with no statistical validity.
