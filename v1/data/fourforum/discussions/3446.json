There are making millions tax free. I also believe many of the civil rights issues of the past 50 years have been blocked by religion. Freedoms for blacks, gays, women. Christianity and the bible have been used for centuries to cause war and spread hate in the name of god. BUT these are just my opinions.",

What happens when we die? etc.\" This in itself isn't bad. And agnosticism and atheism ARE religions despite what many say.\n \n religion \n \n re\u00b7li\u00b7gion [ri l\u00edjj?n]\n n \n 1. religion beliefs and worship: people?s beliefs and opinions concerning the existence, nature, and worship of a deity or deities, and divine involvement in the universe and human life \n \n Microsoft\u00ae Encarta\u00ae Reference Library 2003. \u00a9 1993-2002 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n \n There are other definitions, but they don't apply, such as an obsession.\n \n \n Obviously atheism and agnosticism are people's beliefs. Since everyone has a religion, or basically thought I think religion is a good and unpreventable thing. But the problem arises when these beliefs become facts to some people. And when more than 1 religion thinks their beliefs are \"facts\" then we have a problem. I believe that most religions (in the sense of belief in a god, set of rules, holy book, etc.) are meant to control people (or even if it wasn't their intention, they do a pretty good job). I'm not saying that there is no god, but I am saying that most churches and organized religions tell you many things to try to control you. Doesn't the whole thing about heaven and hell sound like disciplinary action for a child? (If you're bad you're going to timeout/hell) I believe that whatever your religion, you can go to church, but you shouldn't just listen and agree with whatever they say. If you're Christian and your interpretation of the bible is different (for example that miracles are like how we came here on earth and that the not knowing is cool) from that of the church, you shouldn't listen strictly to the church. No matter what your religion, you should still think for yourself. So that just because some people say the bible says gays are evil, you don't just hate all gay people. If you do that, and also respect that other people have other beliefs, religion is fine. But it's hard to keep it like that.",

   "Hello Dzeron:\n Is religion beneficial for the human race, or is it damaging?\n \n I might as well argue the first one. But before I do, I would like to point out that some religions are beneficial, while others are very dangerous. One aspect of religion, is to dictate people's behaviour - because since God made us, He surely has the authority to set the rules!\n \n Dogmatic religions like Chrisitanity teach people that there are \"evil thoughts\" and \"evil emotions\" thus putting the mind and heart in chains. \n \n This is because we all share Adam's sinfulness and rebellous attitude towards God. We all fall short of God's Glory, but God was gracious enough to send His one and only Son to Earth to pay the ultimate price for our sins so that we may return to God. We teach this because we do not want to see people go to hell at the end of time, besides, we get this from God in the Bible. Let me tell you, evil emotions like lust is not a good thing. It can get you into a life of degredation. Sexual immorality and sexual sin can do the same thing. This is why Paul tells us to \"Flee from sexual immorality\" in 1 Corinthians 6:18. There are many other such warnings throughout the Bible. God gives us warnings that by following our own evil or immoral desires, as He knows that if we don't heed to His warnings that we are setting up our life to become one of pain and degredation. \n \n In Psalm 14:1 we are told, \"The fool has said in his heart, there is no God! They acted corruptly; they have done abominable works, there is none who does good.\" Here we see that the Bible connects corrupt thoughts about God - even denying His very existence - with corrupt morals. And it is true that, if there is no God, no Creator who sets the rules, then we are set adrift morally. When the children of Israel forgot their Creator in the times of Judges, when they had no one leading them in being faithful to God, \"...every man did that which was right in his own eyes\" (Judges 21:25), and chaos reigned.\n \n A Supreme Creator who gave Law provides a solid foundation for morality and meaning whereas evolution made everything provides no such basis.\n \n As nations turn their backs on God, living as if He does not exist, sin abounds - political corruption, lying, slander, public displays of debauchery, gambling and greed of all kinds. Economic woes follow as taxes increase and governments borrow money to pay for bigger and bigger police forces, jails, and social security systems to patch up the problems. Many millions have suffered terribly and lost their lives because of the atheistic way of thinking. Atheism kills, because without God, there are no rules - anything goes! \n \n Atheists are at the forefront of efforts to legitimize abortion, euthanasia, drug-taking, prostitution, pornography and promiscuity. All these things cause misery, suffering, and death. Atheism is the philosophy of death. Now atheists love to point to the atrocities committed by supposed \"Christians\" - the Crusades and Northern Ireland are favourites. If these people committing these terrible deeds were indeed Christians, they were/are being inconsistent with their own standard of morality (e.g. do not murder, love your enemies, etc.). However, Stalin, for example, was being consistent with his, because, being an atheist (after reading Darwin), he had no objective basis for any standard of morality. Keith admited that Hitler was also consistent with his evolutionary philosophy.\n \n Christianity says \"God is love\", \"love one another\" and \"love your enemies\". Such love is self-sacrificing. Consequently, Christians have been at the forefront in helping the sick, looking after the orphanned and the aged, feeding the hungry, educating the poor and opposing exploitation through such things as child labour and slavery. Atheism with it's evolutionary rationale, says \"love\" is nothing more than self-interest in increasing the chances of our genes surviving in our offsprint or our close relatives. In the \"struggle for survival of the fittest\", where is the basis for compassion? If the survival of the fittest is evolution's greatest prize, why should wee care for the frail, the mentally defective, the chronically sick, the senile, or the starving? Why should we not give evolution a helping hand by getting rid of them - and the sooner the better? \n \n You might answer something like, \"because it's not right\". Well, why isn't it right? You might say \"because it's wrong\". Why is it wrong? We shall see shortly. In a universe that can be explained solely in terms of physics, chemistry and biology, \"good\" becomes as meaningless as \"evil\", does it not? If you are an atheist, how do you explain goodness, love kindness, generosity or sympathy? Atheists are clearly capable of all of these, but if human beings are just a collection of bones, blood and tissue, what do these things mean and why is there any virtue in them? When Richard Dawkins admits that \"Universal love and the welfare of the species as a whole simply do not make evolutionary sense,\" he is confirming that there is no way to arrive at personal morality from an impersonal universe. If we are nothing but \"genetically programmed machines\", how can we condemn anything as being \"evil\", or commend anything as being \"good\"? Why should we be concerned over issues of justice or fairness, or feel any obligation to treat others with dignity or respect? Our morals and our sense of things being right or wrong, fair or unfair, just or unjust, provides a strong clue that there is some transcedent standard that affects us all. \n \n The purpose of life question can be brought up. Atheism says that life has no purpose, no one is special, we are all just accidents. We have no one who loves us no matter what [for atheists: above deals with this] we do. Many may feel depressed and eventually kill themselves because they think that they are just \"mutated pond scum\" and that they aren't anything special. But on the contrary, Christianity says that we are made in God's image and that we are special, so special in fact that He sent His Son to die for our sins. \n \n Religion also answers the question about what happens after death. Atheism: nothing, there is nothing after death. Christianity, depending on how you lived your life and whether or not you believed Jesus Christ as your LORD and saviour you would either go to a place of eternal pain (i.e. hell) or a place where there will be no suffering and no death to be with our LORD in Heaven. Atheism teaches that death is natural. But people's reaction to death strongly implies the total opposite, that it is an intruder, an enemy, in the world.\n \n Remember the information I told you people in one of these threads about how the agnostic challened Dr Harry Ironside to a debate on \"Agnosticism vs. Christianity\"? How Dr Ironside undertook the task of bringing 100 men and women (down-and-outers or trapped in a degraded life) to the debate who had been gloriously rescued through believing the Gospel the agnostic ridiculed. The sceptic could not bring one man who had been a down-and-outer (e.g. a drunkard, criminal, etc.) and one woman who had been trapped in a degraded life (e.g. prostitution), and show that both of these people had been rescued from their lives of degradation through embracing the philosophy of agnosticism. Once again, the message of the Bible mends lives broken by sin, which separates us from our holy Creator. In contrast, agnosticism and atheisim, like all anti-God philosophies, destroy.\n \n Ritualistic religions like the old Greek religion demand immense sacrifice and waste of resources to please the gods. \n \n Some old religions, like the Aztec one, required human sacrifices I believe.\n \n In contrast, agnosticism and atheism allow people's minds to be free and they make no demands for economic waste  \n \n Actually, as explained above, as people move away from God, sin abounds. Taxes increase as governments pay for bigger and bigger police forces, jails and social security systems to patch up the problems associated with a Godless nation (listed above). This is far more expansive than just giving tithes to the LORD during Church.\n \n All religions when taken too far by fundamentalists is dangerous, including atheism and agnosticism. Stalin and Hitler are two prime examples of this.\n \n The picture here displays an overview of what I have been talking about, i.e. the differences between atheism (and it's evolutionary rationale) and the absolutes of Christianity.\n \n To zachvac:\n So that just because some people say the bible says gays are evil, you don't just hate all gay people. \n \n For one, the Bible doesn't say that \"gays\" are evil, they are immoral. God hates the sin that they commit, not the actual person. I don't know many homosexuals, but one of them I know is okay. I just don't like what he does, that is all because God says to flee from sexual immorality and not to do it. Jude said that, in the book of Jude verse 7, Sodom and Gomorrah (who gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion) serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.",

   "I have a hard time arguing this because I know so many really great religious people. I even see posters on the forum (only from reading some posts), that seem like wonderful people...Big Orn, Joebrummer for example.\n \n I think deep down what I believe is this:\n \n By in large, using reason to based decisions on is best for our society.\n However, I think diversity is key to large random systems where choices can mean survival. It's hard to argue otherwise, even the process of evolution as it applies to life benefits from diversity. Niches get filled, and when an unforseen event strikes 90% of the dominant life forms down, the 10%, even if they were the suckers who lived in rat holes and only came out at night...grow to later rule the world.\n \n Do I think reason lacks something that religion gives? Probably not, but possibly. Many philosphers have claimed that whether you are or are not religious yourself, you need selfishly want your citizens to be religious, because it keeps them in line, and you, the leader, should make decisions based on what's good for everyone, not some religion (yes, be a hipocrit, just don't get caught!)\n \n Does it? I don't know, I doubt it. Look at Europe, they are far less religious than the US, they seem to do just fine. But am I certain? No.\n \n In any case, I like to see religion used for the purposes religion should be used for, namely, to bring certain people comfort, to give people a great excuse to socialize in a setting that promotes some basic \"not bad\" things for people to take part it, for the charity and volunteer work that so many churches provide, etc. In that way, I like the idea of religion but as a \"Way of Life\". Not a way of seperating true from false, or reality from make-believe.\n \n For faith or religion to creep into reason, science, public policy, etc., I think is what is damaging. For someone to burn another human because they \"knew they were evil because god told them so\", is wildly wrong, as is killing yourself because you think you get 20 virgins in the afterlife (IMO). For somone not to embrace the wonder of the theory of evolution...is CRAZY. Finally an answer to so many of the questions about life, and yet some teach the contrary based on faith? Unreal.\n \n So yes, I think religion can be VERY damaging, as can any number of irrational beliefs. Luckily for religion, they have a lot of decent religious people and institutions out there that promote things that are good for the human race, and it makes it hard to pick out the bad seeds. If you make decisions based on this belief that affect others (public policy for instance), if you forgo things like the care of your family or others because of faith (we prayed for him to get better rather than bringing him to a doctor), or if you ignore evidence in favor of faith, then yes, damaging. Organized religion is the most likely to be damaging.\n \n If you are religious, attend church, help your community, promote through action and word things like tolerance, compassion, humility, fun, etc. Damaging? No, I just don't think so. \n \n Is it unfortunate those good people also hold an irrational belief? Yes, but I think you could seperate out the bad from the good ;) \n Although, bad and good is entirely relative, so I probably can't realistically do that either :)\n \n :/ there goes my short answer\n \n -Mach",

   "zachvac:\n Before I start, I can tell that this is going to be a pointless argument that will lead to no plausible conclusions, mainly because you are being willing ignorant or arrogant of my points. You are NOT using LOGIC and thinking. I'm being a fool for even replying to this, but hey, why not?\n \n And of course none of this is happening here in the US. No one lies, no one slanders, etc. right? Of course not.\n \n Once again, you are not listening to my points, or if you are you are purposely missing what them. The United States is turning away from God, Einstein, hence my argument stands.\n \n Just because there is no god does NOT mean there are no rules!!!!!! They (or just as many as Christians) have morals, rules. Just because they follow this because they are decent human beings and don't have to be threatened with hell bothers you in some way?\n \n You are being willingly ignorant or arrogrant - one or the other. I expected you to think and realise that I was talking about absoulte laws that affect us all. We than get to ask questions like, \"Why should I follow the law?\" and \"Who says that I need to follow the law?\" and \"Who has the right to tell me what I can and can't do?\" How do you answer these if there is no transcendent standard that affects us all from God? You can't use the reply \"because it's right (or wrong)\" as the word \"right\" are just as meaningless as \"wrong\" in a naturalistic world view as explained before.\n \n Now, friend, who threatens people with hell? All evangelists concentrate on the Good News of Jesus Christ, rather than trying to black mail someone into believing it by threats. Of course, if you want to continue to reject God, than God will grant you your wish and remove you from His presense when you die. It is totally up to you, you do an action you wear the consequences - even a little child knows this. You break a window, you will have to wear the consequences that come with that. In a similar way, you reject God, you will have to wear the consequences of that...\n \n Once again, I am not saying that \"all atheists are bad\". I think the majority of them are pretty cool and hold a great amount of respect for most of them. It is just that they have no basis for rules and morals/values, sense of right and wrong, just and unjust, etc, which is what I was arguing. You still never dealt with this.\n \n Of course they can cause suffering. Anything can. We should restrict driving, they could crash.  \n \n Are you always like this or do you just do it to annoy me? Come on, think about this, think about this... All those things are against God's word which Christians do not support. They are free will stuff that the person must choose! People don't chose or plan to be in an accident - unless they are thinking about killing themselves.\n \n Do you oppose Asprin? Since foods are drugs do you oppose food? I would challenge you to find why atheists in particular would want the last 3.\n What kind of question are these? Think, friend - and atheists accuse Christians of not doing this [about the Bible's authority]!?!?!. I am talking about dangerous and illicit drugs, such as herrorine, speed and so on, and all drugs in excess. Some, not all atheists would want the last three. I do not want to give the impression that all atheists are like this. In some points, many are, in others, it may be the minority. The reason for doing this: to further whittle down God's authority and the authority of the Bible. If given half the chance, some atheists would destroy Christianity and the Bible. All the last three things go against what God says.\n \n Please tell me how any of these except for killing someone painlessly when they will be killed with pain and suffering causes death?\n \n Abortion for one is killing of a child. The Bible states very clearly that from conception, it is considered a child, a human being. I strongly believe that abortion is just the humane word for \"child killing\". Obviously, the death does not apply to the others. All you had to do was think and apply the words to where they fitted. \n \n Please support the statement that atheism is the philosophy of death.\n \n I have given some evidence for the statement above. Also, according to atheism and it's evolutionary rationale, death is an ally - not an intruder (which it clearly is).\n \n You are saying that these Christians weren't really Christians since they didn't really follow it.  \n \n I said that they are/were being inconsistent with their own Christian values. \n \n Well atheism doesn't encourage stealing, lying, killing, etc. they weren't following atheist beliefs by killing. \n \n No but it doesn't condemn these acts, how can it? According to atheism there is no God. Therefore there are no absolutes by which to compare these acts to to determine whether or not they are right or wrong. Hence, Hitler and many others were being consistent with their beliefs because they had no objective basis for any standard of morality.\n \n And evolution is a scientific THEORY (it's even taught as a theory, not fact) that is widely accepted because no one has been able to refute it logically.  \n \n Thus you have demonstrated where your bias lies. Don't worry, everyone is biased. It all depends as to what worldview we accept as to what we believe to be true about our origins. An atheist will never believe that God made the whole universe, hence he/she is biased and must explain it by naturalistic processes (i.e. evolution).\n \n Ah, we are back at square one again. I have proved many times how evolution is a belief system about the past that cannot be proved by experimental validation, or observations, another word for it is a \"religious belief\". If you were willingly ignorant of it then, you will be willingly ignorant of it now. Tell me, friend, how can we prove that the Earth is six or so billion years old? How do you know that the Grand Canyon was formed over millions of years by a little bit of water as opposed to a short time by a lot of water (i.e. Noah's Flood)? Can you prove that life came from lifeless chemicals billions of years ago? Can you prove that the big bang explosion occured 13 billion years ago? Did you see the progression of life from the simple to the complex over eons of years?\n \n The answer to all of these questions is a very strong \"no\". We weren't there, we did not observe any of these things supposedly happen. We can most definitely not repeat them today. THEREFORE, it is a belief system about the past that MUST be taken by FAITH <intentional empahsis on CAPTALISED letters - no harsh tone<. As I have also said before, I agree with every observation that a scientist makes now, in the present. I agree with the mutations we observe (of which none has been seen to increase information to the genome), the natural selection we see, the genetics, biology astronomy, we observe. I don't disagree with the geology we observe, and so forth. There is nothing in the present that I disagree with an evolutionist about. What you called micro-evolution, we call varriation within a kind - as long as there is no new information being added the genome through any evolutionary process.\n \n As for the statement:\n that is widely accepted because no one has been able to refute it logically. \n \n ROTFLOL! I challange you to read some of the articles from Answers in Genesis AiG and repeat this statement to me after you have read them. Tell me where they have went wrong in their science. No creationist claims that there is no evidence for evolution, and claiming that there has been no logical evidence against it shows that your ignorance and bias blinds you. For instance, there is a lot of evidence that shows the universe is a young Earth:\n * The continents are eroding too quickly - if the continents were billions of years old, they would have eroded by wind and water many times over. Mountain uplift and other \"recycling\" processes are nowhere near capable of compensating for this.\n \n *There is no enough helim in the atmosphere - even if God had creatd the world with no helium to begin with, the small amount in the atmosphere would have taken at most around two million yearrs to accumulate. This is far less than the assumed 3 billion year age of the atmosphere. It rapidly escapes the rocks and enters the atmosphere much faster than it can escape Earth's gravity.\n \n * Many fossils indicate that they must have formed quickly, and could not have taken long time-spans:\n - Common fossils - there are billions of fossil fish in rock layers around the world which are incredibly well-preserved. They frequently show intact fins and often scals, indicating that they were buried rapidly and the rock hardened quikcly. In the real world, dead fish are scavenged within 24 hours. A fish buried quickly in sediment that does not harden within a few weeks at the most will still be subject ot decay by oxygen and bacteria, such that the delicate features like fins, scales, etc., would not preserve their form. Rapid burial in the many underwater landslides and other sedimentary processes accompanying Noah's Flood would explain not only their excellent preservation, but their existence in huge deposits, often covering thousands of square kilometres.\n - Special examples - there have been many instances that are particular spectacular, like the mother icthyosaur appearently \"freeze-framed\" in the process of giving birth. Then there are the fossil fish which are found either in the process of swallowing other fish or with undigested fish intact in their stomachs.\n \n * The oceans are nowhere near salty enough - each year the world's rivers and underground streams add millions of tonnes of salt to the sea, and only a fraction of this goes back onto the land. Using the most favourable possible assumptions for long-agers, the absolute maximum age of the oceans is only a tiny fraction of their assumed billions-of-years age.\n \n The fact that the Earth neither \"looks old\" nor \"looks young\" as such - it all depends on the \"glasses\" through which the evidence is interpreted as to what conclusion we will come up with. We all need to be aware of how much we have been conditioned by our culture to \"see\" geological things as \"looking old\".\n \n The points above are just a few from the article The Earth: how old does it look? These evidences directly contradict the evolutionary belief.\n \n And atheism and evolution are totally different.\n \n Did I even say that they were the same thing? No. I used the word rationale - it does not mean that they are the same thing. Evolution is based on the atheistic way of thinking, i.e. naturalistic (or without God).",

   "zachvac:\n Before I start, I can tell that this is going to be a pointless argument that will lead to no plausible conclusions, mainly because you are being willing ignorant or arrogant of my points. You are NOT using LOGIC and thinking. I'm being a fool for even replying to this, but hey, why not?\n \n\n Some of these may become pointless, but I believe we can come to some conclusion, even if it is just learning about other peoples' opinions.\n \n \n\n And of course none of this is happening here in the US. No one lies, no one slanders, etc. right? Of course not.\n \n Once again, you are not listening to my points, or if you are you are purposely missing what them. The United States is turning away from God, Einstein, hence my argument stands.\n \n\n Sorry, I did not understand what you were trying to say. But I don't think we're turning away from God. A nation that writes \"in God we trust\" on money isn't turning away from God. A nation that makes it's citizens swear on the Bible isn't turning away from God. A nation that has a president who is trying to exclude gays from marriage based on the fact that the sanctity of marriage (as presented in the bible) needs to be protected. I hear every morning in school how this nation is \"under God\". I fail to see how we're turning away from God.\n \n \n \n\n Just because there is no god does NOT mean there are no rules!!!!!! They (or just as many as Christians) have morals, rules. Just because they follow this because they are decent human beings and don't have to be threatened with hell bothers you in some way?\n \n You are being willingly ignorant or arrogrant - one or the other. I expected you to think and realise that I was talking about absoulte laws that affect us all. We than get to ask questions like, \"Why should I follow the law?\" and \"Who says that I need to follow the law?\" and \"Who has the right to tell me what I can and can't do?\" How do you answer these if there is no transcendent standard that affects us all from God? You can't use the reply \"because it's right (or wrong)\" as the word \"right\" are just as meaningless as \"wrong\" in a naturalistic world view as explained before.\n \n\n I understand your point perfectly, but I was trying to make mine. Obviously laws made by god like don't kill and other stuff aren't absolute. On the crime thread here someone said that 91% of child molesters are religious. I'm pretty sure most religions advocate against that, yet they broke that law. The only difference between atheists and religious people is that religious people act on these \"laws\" for fear of god, atheists follow these laws because they know they are the right thing to do without having to have a god tell them not to.\n \n \n\n Now, friend, who threatens people with hell? All evangelists concentrate on the Good News of Jesus Christ, rather than trying to black mail someone into believing it by threats. Of course, if you want to continue to reject God, than God will grant you your wish and remove you from His presense when you die. It is totally up to you, you do an action you wear the consequences - even a little child knows this. You break a window, you will have to wear the consequences that come with that. In a similar way, you reject God, you will have to wear the consequences of that...\n \n\n \n So you're saying it's not a threat, but it will happen. Consequences are a threat. The government threatens to put you in jail if you murder someone. Doesn't mean they're bad but the Christian belief is that you will go to hell if you sin. That's what a threat is.\n \n \n \n\n Once again, I am not saying that \"all atheists are bad\". I think the majority of them are pretty cool and hold a great amount of respect for most of them. It is just that they have no basis for rules and morals/values, sense of right and wrong, just and unjust, etc, which is what I was arguing. You still never dealt with this.\n \n\n The basis they have is that they know it's the right thing to do without a god telling them it's the right thing to do. My basis for not hurting people is that I don't want to hurt people, not because God told me not to.\n \n \n\n Of course they can cause suffering. Anything can. We should restrict driving, they could crash.  \n \n Are you always like this or do you just do it to annoy me? Come on, think about this, think about this... All those things are against God's word which Christians do not support. They are free will stuff that the person must choose! People don't chose or plan to be in an accident - unless they are thinking about killing themselves.\n \n\n The original statement was that \"abortion, euthanasia, drug-taking cause suffering\" and that atheists are at the forefront of these. First of all I don't believe that's true (about atheists being the only group for these) and I think in some cases abortion can cause more good than suffering. We can argue about abortion later but I don't believe it as killing, only as removing it before it's turned into a human. And actually drugs usually cause a feeling of calmness (of course people find it hard to stop this) which isn't exactly suffering.\n \n \n \n \n\n Do you oppose Asprin? Since foods are drugs do you oppose food? I would challenge you to find why atheists in particular would want the last 3.\n What kind of question are these? Think, friend - and atheists accuse Christians of not doing this [about the Bible's authority]!?!?!. I am talking about dangerous and illicit drugs, such as herrorine, speed and so on, and all drugs in excess. Some, not all atheists would want the last three. I do not want to give the impression that all atheists are like this. In some points, many are, in others, it may be the minority. The reason for doing this: to further whittle down God's authority and the authority of the Bible. If given half the chance, some atheists would destroy Christianity and the Bible. All the last three things go against what God says.\n \n\n And I'm sure some Christians would also want the last three. And I don't. I know you said this but just want to reiterate it. Not all atheists break God's rules just because we don't think he said them. We follow them because we are decent human beings who understand that they are bad.\n \n \n \n\n Please tell me how any of these except for killing someone painlessly when they will be killed with pain and suffering causes death?\n \n Abortion for one is killing of a child. The Bible states very clearly that from conception, it is considered a child, a human being. I strongly believe that abortion is just the humane word for \"child killing\". Obviously, the death does not apply to the others. All you had to do was think and apply the words to where they fitted. \n \n\n OK, I disagree on abortion. There we will get nowhere arguing about it, we believe different things.\n \n \n\n Please support the statement that atheism is the philosophy of death.\n \n I have given some evidence for the statement above. Also, according to atheism and it's evolutionary rationale, death is an ally - not an intruder (which it clearly is).\n \n\n You're evidence has shown where atheism doesn't specifically oppose death and other bad things, but not where it actually promotes these things. And I don't believe death is an ally. I just see death as the inevitable end of my life, which I would rather be as far away as possible, while recognizing that it will come no matter what. You're making huge generalizations for what a small number of atheists actually believe.\n \n \n \n\n You are saying that these Christians weren't really Christians since they didn't really follow it.  \n \n I said that they are/were being inconsistent with their own Christian values. \n \n\n OK, understood.\n \n \n\n Well atheism doesn't encourage stealing, lying, killing, etc. they weren't following atheist beliefs by killing. \n \n No but it doesn't condemn these acts, how can it? According to atheism there is no God. Therefore there are no absolutes by which to compare these acts to to determine whether or not they are right or wrong. Hence, Hitler and many others were being consistent with their beliefs because they had no objective basis for any standard of morality.\n \n\n You're right that it doesn't condemn these acts. But you can't call it being consistent with their beliefs because the religion doesn't specifically condemn what they're doing. I understand what you mean but atheism isn't meant to be rules to live by like Christianity. It is the simple belief that we have to live ourselves, without God telling us what to do. I'll bet I follow almost every rule in the bible, I haven't read it but have some knowledge of it. I just do it for a different reason than Christians do, I do it because I know it's the right thing to do, instead of just because god told me not to.\n \n \n \n\n And evolution is a scientific THEORY (it's even taught as a theory, not fact) that is widely accepted because no one has been able to refute it logically.  \n \n Thus you have demonstrated where your bias lies. Don't worry, everyone is biased. It all depends as to what worldview we accept as to what we believe to be true about our origins. An atheist will never believe that God made the whole universe, hence he/she is biased and must explain it by naturalistic processes (i.e. evolution).\n \n Ah, we are back at square one again. I have proved many times how evolution is a belief system about the past that cannot be proved by experimental validation, or observations, another word for it is a \"religious belief\". If you were willingly ignorant of it then, you will be willingly ignorant of it now. Tell me, friend, how can we prove that the Earth is six or so billion years old? How do you know that the Grand Canyon was formed over millions of years by a little bit of water as opposed to a short time by a lot of water (i.e. Noah's Flood)? Can you prove that life came from lifeless chemicals billions of years ago? Can you prove that the big bang explosion occured 13 billion years ago? Did you see the progression of life from the simple to the complex over eons of years?\n \n The answer to all of these questions is a very strong \"no\". We weren't there, we did not observe any of these things supposedly happen. We can most definitely not repeat them today. THEREFORE, it is a belief system about the past that MUST be taken by FAITH <intentional empahsis on CAPTALISED letters - no harsh tone<. As I have also said before, I agree with every observation that a scientist makes now, in the present. I agree with the mutations we observe (of which none has been seen to increase information to the genome), the natural selection we see, the genetics, biology astronomy, we observe. I don't disagree with the geology we observe, and so forth. There is nothing in the present that I disagree with an evolutionist about. What you called micro-evolution, we call varriation within a kind - as long as there is no new information being added the genome through any evolutionary process.\n \n\n \n \n I understand that it's just a theory. I happen to see more evidence in it than creationism. Again I don't think it's worth arguing over because both of us are so biased to the opposite side.\n \n \n\n As for the statement:\n that is widely accepted because no one has been able to refute it logically. \n \n ROTFLOL! I challange you to read some of the articles from Answers in Genesis AiG and repeat this statement to me after you have read them. Tell me where they have went wrong in their science. No creationist claims that there is no evidence for evolution, and claiming that there has been no logical evidence against it shows that your ignorance and bias blinds you. For instance, there is a lot of evidence that shows the universe is a young Earth:\n * The continents are eroding too quickly - if the continents were billions of years old, they would have eroded by wind and water many times over. Mountain uplift and other \"recycling\" processes are nowhere near capable of compensating for this.\n \n *There is no enough helim in the atmosphere - even if God had creatd the world with no helium to begin with, the small amount in the atmosphere would have taken at most around two million yearrs to accumulate. This is far less than the assumed 3 billion year age of the atmosphere. It rapidly escapes the rocks and enters the atmosphere much faster than it can escape Earth's gravity.\n \n * Many fossils indicate that they must have formed quickly, and could not have taken long time-spans:\n - Common fossils - there are billions of fossil fish in rock layers around the world which are incredibly well-preserved. They frequently show intact fins and often scals, indicating that they were buried rapidly and the rock hardened quikcly. In the real world, dead fish are scavenged within 24 hours. A fish buried quickly in sediment that does not harden within a few weeks at the most will still be subject ot decay by oxygen and bacteria, such that the delicate features like fins, scales, etc., would not preserve their form. Rapid burial in the many underwater landslides and other sedimentary processes accompanying Noah's Flood would explain not only their excellent preservation, but their existence in huge deposits, often covering thousands of square kilometres.\n - Special examples - there have been many instances that are particular spectacular, like the mother icthyosaur appearently \"freeze-framed\" in the process of giving birth. Then there are the fossil fish which are found either in the process of swallowing other fish or with undigested fish intact in their stomachs.\n \n * The oceans are nowhere near salty enough - each year the world's rivers and underground streams add millions of tonnes of salt to the sea, and only a fraction of this goes back onto the land. Using the most favourable possible assumptions for long-agers, the absolute maximum age of the oceans is only a tiny fraction of their assumed billions-of-years age.\n \n The fact that the Earth neither \"looks old\" nor \"looks young\" as such - it all depends on the \"glasses\" through which the evidence is interpreted as to what conclusion we will come up with. We all need to be aware of how much we have been conditioned by our culture to \"see\" geological things as \"looking old\".\n \n The points above are just a few from the article The Earth: how old does it look? These evidences directly contradict the evolutionary belief.\n \n And atheism and evolution are totally different.\n \n Did I even say that they were the same thing? No. I used the word rationale - it does not mean that they are the same thing. Evolution is based on the atheistic way of thinking, i.e. naturalistic (or without God).\n\n OK, but I do know some Christians who are evolutionists. They aren't mutually exclusive. I understand how you accept that as proof and I could argue that it's wrong and you'd say how I'm wrong and neither would budge. (similar to my pointing out the flaws in Noah's ark, I thought it was solid evidence, you didn't think so) so unless you want to continue this debate, I'll let it go that we both believe different things.",

   "Now, I can't cut and paste all I've seen, but I'll refute a few points I saw argued on the other side.\n \n 1) Atheism is the philosophy of death.\n \n Not so. Atheism (and don't forget agnosticism) is often combined with libertarian morality, that is, the belief that tyranny is the only immoral act. Killing someone without their permission is a form of tyranny. Even atheists/agnostics argue that murder, stealing, and the like are immoral, because they are in effect tyrannical. Nihilism is the only form of atheism that says otherwise.\n \n \"Tyranny\" in this case means using force on someone against their will.\n \n 2) Nations decline when they turn away from God.\n Not always. The Roman Empire declined when it turned towards God, that is, when Constantine forced Christianity on the whole country. Other, non-christian nations like Turkey, China, and Zimbabwe were once world powers, too. Just because Christian nations were world powers once doesn't mean that they were the only world powers.\n \n 3) Atheists are usually social libertarians, therefore they are EVIL!\n \n Never have I heard a more anti-humanist conservative rant like this one. Social libertarianism, that is, legalising gay marriage, drugs, curse words, and the like, is based on the idea that individuals should make the decision as to what is harmful or helpful for themselves.\n \n 4) Hitler and Stalin were athesits, therefore all atheists are like Hitler and Stalin.\n \n Not true. Many atheists, and probably most American atheists, are libertarians. Ever heard of Ayn Rand?\n \n Correlation does not imply causation. Hitler's philosophy of Nazism was not based on atheism, it was based on racism, which is also advocated by the KKK, which is a Christian organisation.",
