   "I have a serious question for those in the know. I haven't posted here for some time but thought I would give it a try to see what kind of intelligent responses I might get. I've puzzled over this issue for a long time and have never been satisfied with the various explanations.\n ===================================\n \n Can someone actually provide me with a link or known proven facts that Atta was not in Prague when he was alleged to be? The reason I ask this question is because Frank Rich, the well known columnist from the NYT was on the Don Imus show recently and said it was established fact that he was not. I can't contact him directly to ask him how he knows this, so I am throwing this out here for anyone who actually may know, or is certain beyond any doubt that he wasn't.\n \n I realize that the 9/11 Commission Report has said there is no evidence he was there and that credit card receipts, phone records, etc, don't support this allegation. However, to my best recollection, there is no actual proof that I am aware of that says definitively he wasn't there. Some believe he was there; most believe he wasn't or couldn't have been there. But I've seen no final proof, one way or another.\n \n The reason I regard this as so important is because of all of the hub-bub about the WMD controversey. Putting that aside right now, it is my contention that if Atta actually met with an Iraqi intelligence agency, the WMD matter (which has been discussed and argued ad nauseum) would be far less important or almost irrelevant because that would tie Saddam directly to Al Queda (or more specifically to 9/11) . Such a connection would, in my judgment, be sufficient to remove him from power.\n \n Rich is an important columnist. A serious thinker. I suppose I can write him a letter as there is no provision in the NYT web site to send him an e-mail. Can anyone shed some light on this subject with facts; not opinions? I really want to know.",

   "I think it`s based on the fact that Mr Atta didn`t use his passport during this time. It is of course possible that he used an alias and had a fake passport. Problem with this is that any \"evidence\" of him not being there can be claimed to be \"fake\". Until there are any evidence of him actually being there, one should probably err on the side of caution and assume that he wasn`t. \n \n The idea that Atta would have met with al-Ani in Prague at the time in question is based on an eyewitness report from a BIS agent. The agent did not recognize Atta until he saw the picture half a year later on Czech television and there are no other evidence of Attas presence in Prague at the time.\n \n furthermore, the US has been able to capture al-Ani in Iraq and has no doubt allready intoregated him. There have been no reporting on any information gleaned from al-Ani, but one could suspect that if there had surfaced any information strengthening the case for the Iraqi-invasion, it would have leaked pretty quickly with the good memory of the administration. \n \n It is always hard to prove a negative, especially if \"evidence\" is being discarded as \"possibly fake\" as in the case of Atta not having used his passport to leave the US. Several CIA officials have also made statments indicating that CIA does not believe any meeting between Atta and al-Ani took place.\n \n It could perhaps also be important to point out that it is far from certain that Atta and al-Alani would have met regarding 9/11, assuming they met at all. Al-Ani was trying to recruit terrorists on his own (according to BIS) to make an attack on Radio Free Europe. \n \n So, is it an established fact that Atta did not visit prague? I would say that the complete lack of evidence of him actually ebing there makes it an established fact. But I guess that would depend on you choose to definite \"established fact\".\n \n BTW, Welcome back mule :)",

   "This is the serious discussion I was looking for as this had been beat to death on another forum as an argument. I don't wish to argue about this. That is not my purpose and I'm not carrying Bush's water on this matter. As I stated I listened carefully to Rich's discussion about Iraq and then he made this categorical statement and I wondered how he could be so certain. I hadn't given it a whole lot of thought recently although I have a copy of the 9/11 Commission Report which says there is no evidence that he was there. However, we do have certain facts that have yet to be explained. I throw them out for your consideration.\n \n 1) Atta was known to be in Prague at certain times. This is not in question. He also studied in Hamburg and if memory serves me correctly received a master's degree there as well.\n \n 2) The Iraqi agent Al-Ani was known to be in Prague although his statement doesn't square with the facts according the Czech intelligence. Currently he is in CIA custody in Baghdad but isn't talking. Why?\n \n 3) Al-Ani's own diary states that he met with a \"Hamburg Student\" on April 8 (the date in question.) Who was that person?\n \n \"Czech intelligence found Al-Ani's appointment calendar in Iraq's Prague embassy, presumably after Saddam Hussein's defeat. Al-Ani's diary lists an April 8, 2001, meeting with \"Hamburg student.\"\n \n \"According to his May 26, 2000 Czech visa application - submitted in Bonn, Germany - Atta called himself a \"Hamburg student.\" He had studied urban planning for seven years at Hamburg-Harburg Technical University and launched an Islamic club there in 1999.\"\n \n http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200406030932.asp\n \n http://www.computerbytesman.com/911/praguefaq.htm\n \n Here are some photos in question. One is of Al-Ani and the other is alleged by some to be Atta. Certainly Al-Ani could tell us who this person is but again, he isn't talking. Why?\n \n http://www.thexreport.com/alani2.jpg\n \n http://www.thexreport.com/alani14.jpg\n \n I want to stress again that I am not arguing one way or another. I'm just looking to understand this mystery. So far as I know, no one has ever presented any absolute proof that Atta did not meet with Al-Ani. This is highly critical because this would establish a virtual link to Saddam and 9/11.\n \n Here is another discussion. Epstein recently wrote an analysis of this situation in the November 22, 2005 issue of the WSJ issue which has piqued my interest.\n \n http://edwardjayepstein.com/2002question/prague.htm\n \n http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007584",

Never seen you this focused before (and I have been in your cybor-shadows for how many years now?) on any particular issue. Are you on to something? What's your gut saying?\n\n \n My gut is saying that al-Ani is hiding something and it points to Saddam's involvement. I posted this elsewhere but let me post it here and you can see what I am driving at. The essence of my reply is that Al-Ani can't be trusted. See what you think. Note: this is but the latest of replies to a thread that has reached well over a hundred replies and no one has been able to document the fact that Atta was not in Prague on April 9, 2001.\n =======================================\n I'm rather surprised this hasn't come up before. In any event I have just finished reading the 9/11 Commission Report about seven times regarding the Atta/Prague matter. I won't regurgitate at this time the Atta business but what I found profoundly interesting was the part about Al-Ani. It is found on pages 228 and 229 of the report. And I quote:\n \n \"According to the Czech government, Ani, the Iraqi officer alleged to have met with Atta was about 70 miles away from Prague on April 8-9 and did not return until the afternoon of the ninth, while the source was firm that the sighting occurred at 11:00 A.M. When questioned about the reported April 2001 meeting, Ani -- now in custody -- has denied ever meeting or having any contact with Atta. Ani says that shortly after 9/11, he became concerned that press stories about the alleged meeting might hurt his career. (What a pantload - my comment) Hoping to clear his name, Ani asked his superiors to approach the Czech government about refuting the allegation. He also denies knowing any other Iraqi official having contact with Atta.\"\n -------------------------------------------\n \n ... The more probable facts are that Al-Ani is not yet coming clean. If Mr. Al-Ani is clean, why didn't he raise a stink when he was summarily kicked out of the Czech Republic. Mr. Ruzek does not mince words. This gets to the heart of the matter. What is Al-Ani hiding? Read on.\n \n From the 11/22/05 piece:\n \n To sort out the confusion, I met earlier this month in Prague with Jiri Ruzek, chief at the time of the Czech counterintelligence service, BIS. Mr. Ruzek is in a position to know what happened...\n \n (Snip)\n \n The proximate cause for BIS interest in al-Ani was a sensational revelation of Jabir Salim, the Iraqi consul who defected in Prague in December 1998. Mr. Salim said in his debriefings that the Mukhabarat, Iraq's intelligence service, had given him $150,000 and tasked him with carrying out a covert action against an American target in the Czech Republic: Using a freelance terrorist, he was to blow up the headquarters of Radio Free Europe in Wenceslas Square, in the heart of Prague.\n \n Ahmad al-Ani was Jabir Salim's replacement at the embassy. Soon after he arrived in March 1999, he was picked up by U.S. countersurveillance cameras. The interest in him intensified after the BIS learned from its penetration of the embassy that he was attempting to acquire explosives and contact foreign-based Arabs. Then, on April 9, 2001, the BIS's source in the embassy reported that al-Ani had gotten into a car with an unknown foreign Arab. After the car managed to elude BIS surveillance, concern mounted that he was in the process of recruiting his bomber, and, since the BIS could not find the mystery Arab, Mr. Ruzek decided to act pre-emptively. He recommended to Foreign Minister Kavan that al-Ani be immediately expelled from the Czech Republic. He was given 48 hours to get out of Prague on April 19--and he returned to Baghdad.\n \n (Snip)\n \n Al-Ani was captured by the CIA in Baghdad in 2003, and he remains in detention in Iraq. Though no one has been allowed to interview him, he told the CIA that he was not anywhere near Prague at the time of the meeting. Although Mr. Ruzek termed al-Ani's claim of being elsewhere \"pure nonsense,\"\n \n (Snip)\n \n Before 9/11, when the investigation into al-Ani's activities was initiated, both the CIA and the BIS took deadly serious the allegation of state-sponsored terrorism directed against Radio Free Europe. Both agencies cooperated in attempting to thwart it, accepting the information furnished by the BIS penetration agent as sufficiently reliable to expel al-Ani...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007584",

When people lie, they do it for advancement, not to make themselves look like fools.\n\n \n I've read through you reply once and will reread it tomorrow when I'm not so bleary eyed. Your logic is essentially on target as I read it. However, I would say this. I spent 30 years in investigation and didn't give too much thought to this subject. I listened carefully to what Rich said on the Imus show and agreed with his reasoning until he trotted out the Atta business and then I said whoaa, wait a minute. I recalled reading just a few days prior the Epstein article in the WSJ. (The same article had appeared first in Slate in 2003 and the WSJ was a light update.) I knew from the reports that the Atta report had been sloughed off as not likely but I never could recall that it had been totally debunked. So that's where I am coming from.\n \n I don't give a damn about the Bush administration. I'm not carrying his water here. What I am interested in is the mystery of what actually happened in Prague. And I would argue with a fence post, if necessary, that that mystery is yet to be cleared up. Al Ani obviously can clear it up promptly. Why hasn't he? Why did he put into his own diary that he met with a \"Hamburg student\" on that date when he said he was not even in the area and to which the Czech intelligence head says is pure bulloney. Did he lie to his dairy? \n \n Something else to chew on. Chris Hitchens looked at this as well. He and Epstein are evidently arch enemies (don't ask me what that is all about because I don't know.) and he also interviewed Ruzek and came to the conclusion that Epstein was correct. So what we have here are two world class thinkers who come down to the same conclusion. Al-Ani is a lying SOS and the question is why?\n \n Finally, the actual 9/11 Commission Report makes no conclusion that the meeting did not occur; only that it was improbable and when I carefully read it for about seven times or so, the absurdity of Al-Ani's position jumped out at me. It didn't make any sense. and no one on the Commission evidently took the time to think it through either.\n \n Later.",

   "\n \n We also KNOW that Donald rumfeld had access to that same information, and confirmed that the leaks were correct, the alleged meeting simpyl did nto take place.\n \n \n\n \n Help me here. How do you KNOW that? Rumsfeld confirmed that the leaks that Atta was not in Prague were NOT correct? News to me. Do you have a quote? He may very well have said it but he might have mispoken or been misinterpreted. I know of nothing that establishes Atta's whereabouts on April 11, 2001 anywhere to be found.\n \n I was listening to Rumsfeld tonight. I think he is just burned out and mentally exhausted. I look for him to be replaced in the next couple of months (but I could be wrong.)\n ===================================\n BTW, I don't necessarily agree with your conclusions in your entire post. Remember that history teaches us that strange things happen that on the surface look to be exceedingly foolish. The Battle at San Jacinto and Sam Houston come to mind. Churchill allowing Allied shipping to be sunk rather than revealing the Enigma Machine is another. And of course we now know that the Allies deliberately withheld the true murderers of the Polish officers in the Katyn Forrest Massacre in order not to split off their Polish allies inside and outside of the U.S. \n \n I can think of a number of reason why it might be advantageous to withhold such information; not the least of which is to lure Saddamists into a false sense of security and to test statements that Al-Ani might have made to the CIA. I wouldn't be so sure that Bush & Company aren't holding a trump card to play at the right time. Remember the Rathergate mess? That, I am now convinced, was a perfect setup to innoculate Bush from the NG story. It worked, regardless.",

There are nearly 11,000 hits on Google for him. Some of it is repetitious but the preponderance of evidence convinces me of links to Al Queda and a very possible solution to the long and unexplained anthrax mystery. That is to say, what exactly was the purported visit to Prague for if indeed Atta went there as alleged? Some information leads me to believe that this is where the anthrax spores originated. There were only three countries in the world that manufactured military grade anthrax. I'll let you figure out which of those countries were. Then there were some interesting money transfers that have yet to be explained.\n \n As I went to bed last night a light bulb went off in my head. Al-Ani was captured by the CIA in July, 2003. Saddam was captured in December, 2003. So far as we know, Al-Ani is unaware that Saddam has been captured. Saddam ran a Stalinist regime that in some respects even outdid Stalin's evil deeds such as feeding his perceived threats into giant paper shredders. It would stand that al-Ani was terrified of turning on Saddam and having Saddam get to him in the future. Two and 1/2 years have elapsed since Al-Ani's capture. What's been going on? Assume that the CIA has been \"coddling\" Al-Ani and allowing him to believe that Saddam is still out there and instead getting information about such things as Iraqi and Al Queda terror sites scattered throughout the world. He might be willing to give that information up to get good treatment, but giving up Saddam would be very improbable. (who we didn't need anyway since we already had him in custody.)\n \n Remember that Aziz even refused to take the letter from Baker in 1991 to give to Saddam. It is reported that Aziz's face went completely white when he read the comments. The fear that Saddam ruled Iraq was perhaps the most completely totalitarian regime that has ever existed.\n \n Bush has accomplished a lot in the war on terror. We haven't been attacked again. Saddam is out of power. Syria is out of Lebanon. Libya has thrown in the towel. Pakistan has started to come clean. Syria is getting \"religion\" about the terror threats. Iran is increasingly isolated. Arafat is dead and good riddance to bad rubbish. Iraq is moving toward democracy and all we hear from the Bush detractors is \"Bush lied\" and there is no connection between Iraq and terrorism which is palpable nonsense. \n \n Until that \"Hamburg student\" is identified as being other than Mohammad Atta I am prepared to say I am convinced to a reasonable certainty it was him in Prague (which he visited more than once - some say up to four times), on April 9, 2003. That is sufficient to establish a prima facia case to remove Saddam over and above the WMD argument. There is also the matter of a $104 million judgment against Saddam and Al Queda for the 9/11 attacks.\n \n And then we have the very possible solution to the long-standing anthrax mystery. Atta was previously reported to have had symptoms of anthrax poisoning on his hands. See below.\n ===============================\n (Snip)\n \n Last August, Gregg Chatterton, a pharmacist at Huber Healthmart Drugs in Delray Beach, Fla., says two men he later identified as Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, two of the September 11 suicide hijackers, wandered into his pharmacy. Chatterton approached the men to see if they needed any help and noticed Atta's hands were flaming red. \"Both hands were red from the wrist down,\" recalls Chatterton. \"If you filled your sink with bleach and stuck your hands in there for six hours, they would come out red,\" he says, \"and that is what they looked like.\" Chatterton thought the two men might have been construction workers, who often get red, irritated hands, or perhaps Atta had been gardening and had an allergic reaction. \"I asked [Atta] if he had done any gardening,\" says Chatterton, \"and he was very rude and just pooh-poohed me. He said: `I don't garden.' \" Chatterton finally sold Atta a 1-ounce tube of \"acid mantle,\" a medication that helps replenish your skin, says Chatterton. Shehhi also bought a bottle of Robitussin for what Chatterton described as a hacking cough. Chatterton believes Atta's red hands were a result of frequent washing with bleach, perhaps, or some other chemical. Chatterton had seen many photographs of cutaneous anthrax when he served on the infectious control committee of several local hospitals. \"It did not look like cutaneous anthrax,\" he says. Chatterton described the two men as \"well dressed and well groomed\" but very rude. \"It was like meeting Hitler,\" he says of Atta. A Czech cabinet minister Friday became the first official to publicly acknowledge that Atta also met with an Iraqi intelligence agent during a trip to the Czech Republic several weeks before the agent was expelled on April 22. Government officials told the Associated Press that the agent, Ahmad Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani, had been under surveillance by Czech intelligence, who believe he might have been involved in plotting an attack on the headquarters of Radio Free Europe...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/011105/archive_019478_2.htm",

   "Nah, that one doesn`t hold. It was allready an established fact that the Iraqi ambasador in Prague had attempted to recruit terrorists to bomb Radio Europe. A link to Atta with the same objective would not be a reason to invade iraq. That`s just afterhand rationalisation (and is among the things the US administration has been critizised for).\n\n \n I see you didn't address why Al-Ani might be resisting (if indeed he has) confirming that he met with Atta or that he knew that no other Iraqi intelligence officer had ever met Atta. None of us know what he has told the CIA since he was captured 2.5 years ago. \n \n I have this novel theory that says Bush remains steadfast in his Iraq policy because he has this \"ace in the hole\" that he will present when the time is right. That is to say he can definitively establish the link with Saddam and 9/11. That would eviserate his political opponents whose only strategy is defeatism. \n \n I would remind you that CBS fell into a trap with the Rathergate episode that was almost certainly engineered out of the WH to innoculate Bush against the NG controversey. Even Terry McAwliffe (DNC chairman at the time) immediately said that the Dems had been \"set up\" by Karl Rove.

And neither for that matter is Epstein who recently wrote about the alleged Atta/Al-Ani connection. He has written a long and very detailed analysis of the Kennedy assassination as well that debunks virtually all of the conspiracy theories.\n \n And then there is Chris Hitchens as well, (who hates Epstein) that even had to admit that the connection was likely real. Here is his take.\n \n \"I have only just read Edward Epstein's contribution to the continuing argument about an Iraq-Al Quaeda connection. Anyone who knows either of us knows that Mr. Epstein and I dislike each other intensely, so I thought it only right that I should confirm one aspect of his essay from my own knowledge.\n \n Last fall I paid a visit to Jan Kavan, the former Czech foreign minister who had become chairman of that session of the United Nations General Assembly. Mr Kavan and I have been friends for many years. My ostensible reason for accepting his invitation to call upon him was this: I wanted to introduce him to a Kurdish official who had observer status at the UN. Only later in the conversation did I think to ask him about the much-debated and seemingly-discredited story of a meeting in Prague between Mohammed Atta and the Ba'athist envoy al-Ani. To my surprise, Mr Kavan was able to give direct evidence of his own role in this investigation (including the deportation order he had served on al-Ani) and to say that in his opinion there was at least a \"sixty five per cent chance\" that the meeting with Atta had in fact occurred.\n \n I know that Jan Kavan is a very meticulous person and so I asked him why he had chosen the \"sixty five per cent\", rather than, say, fifty. He replied that it was because he thought the likelihood of the meeting was at least that high. He added that he had no idea what was discussed, or would have been discussed, had the meeting been confirmed beyond doubt.\n \n It may not be irrelevant to mention that Mr Kavan, though highly professional as a diplomat and as a minister, is very far from being a sympathiser of the Bush administration. At the time we met, the rift between the administration and the UN over Iraq was in the process of becoming acute.\n \n Last fall, I did not feel I had his permission to quote him on a subject which had not been part of our original agenda, and so I refrained from citing him by name. Now that he has gone on record I would like to add this earlier indication that he knew what he was talking about - a rare quality in the present debate.\"\n \n \n \n http://www.slate.com/id/2091354/",
