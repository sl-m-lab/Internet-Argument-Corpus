If he's got the bucks.... and thanks to the millions of Americans who donated small amounts to his campaign.... he's got the bucks, why not?\nHe's got the bucks because he lied to McCain when they agree to accept the taxpayer contributions to the campaign. Obama is a sleazy, lying Marxist. He will stoop to any level to get elected. He will use ACORN to register illegal votes, he will continue to spread lies about McCain and his proposed policies up until such time as the polls close. I accept the inevitability of his being our president...because I know that the majority of the electorate does not know the difference between a Marxist and a Magic Marker...but I will never respect the man...and I will shortly be able to say, \"I told you so.\" We're screwed!\n \n \nNo matter what my sentiments about John Sydney McCain III, or even Sarah Palin, I would not wish that sort of thing on either one of them.\n \n I simply can't embrace this terrorism thing.\nThen how can you embrace Barack Hussein Obama...the one that works so well with Bill Ayers, the unrepentant American terrorist?",
