   "The abortion debate is one I've always preferred to steer clear of because of it devisiveness and the sensative nature of the debate. Personally, I am oppossed to abortion but I can see how some people might see it as the right option for them, especially in cases involving rape. \n \n I live in Ireland where abortion is illegal but thousands of women travel from here to britain every year for abortions, you can even get it done on ships just outside our territorial waters. So up until recently my attitude was that they might as well legalise it here and save all those women travelling. \n \n But then it occured to me that Ireland has one of the highest birth rates in Europe (and the aging population crisis facing Europe is one of my key economic concerns) and I wondered if the higher birth rate has something to do with the illegality of abortion. Regardless of whether or not it does, I have decided that not only am I personally against abortion, but I am firmly against it because we need the workers.\n \n P.S. I am a Catholic (by upbringing and education) turned Atheist turned Agnostic who's personal views about abortion have nothing to do with religion.",

   "Let's consider the flip side. \n \n Banning abortion will not end abortion. Women will still do it illegally, and often without trained doctors and proper facilities, many will die. That results in the loss of 18-35 year old women across the board. That cuts down workers, as well as future child bearers. Not to mention that if these women have families, then the financial problems to such familes ultimately fall upon society. And we simply cannot forget that the child that will be born, to mothers who cannot care for them. That leads to poor parenting, neglect, death, and all sorts of problems that society, which includes you, will have to pay for, often with more then just money. Poverty is often a cause of violent crime. Many unwanted, poorely cared for children with few skills will fall into poverty. As I said, society will pay for it with more then just money. \n \n Besides, workers can be achieved through immigration. Do you realize how much it costs to raise a productive child in a western society? Economically it's far cheaper to gain workers through immigration rather then banning abortion.",

It's not like people reported why because of legal fears. So really, that's a moot point. The larger issue is that society is going to have to pay in blood and cash for the children no one wanted.",

   "Immigration is insufficuent to supply enough workers for the european economy, after integration immigrants adjust to the same demagraphic patterns as the rest of the population.\n\n \n That would be true: if immigrant was open for a time and then closed. That is not the case here. Besides, you are assuming that would occur very rapidly, which is dubious itself. \n \n \nImmigration is only a temporary solution, and in any case European politicans lack the will to stand up to the hysteria about immigration amongst citizens.\n\n \n True, but it does not mean that banning abortion will solve the problem. Immigrant gives a country able bodied workers without having to pay for their upbringing while sucking the prime of their lives out for the good of the economy. It would be easier to allow immigrantion rather then banning abortion. \n \n \nEurope needs immigrants, but immigrants are not enough. One could equally argue that immigration leads to social unrest much more serious than the consequences of banning abortion.\n\n \n One could, but I don't see you doing so. Let's consider the US. Who commits most of the crime? Which areas of the US are the most dangerous? Does it tie to immigration? Let's consider Israel, a nation of immigrants. Where are the problems of crime? Israel has been immigrating thousands every year, and yet almost all of the domestic problems are not with the immigrants, but with the palestinian conflict. \n \n \nThere are only two possible (morally acceptable) solutions to the encroaching crisis, increase the birth rate (which abortion may or may not be a factor in) or find the solution to switching off the aging process.\n\n \n Banning abortion is not the solution. Many people are not having kids FOR economic reasons. It costs litteraly 100,000 to raise a child from birth to 18 in the Us, likely much higher in Europe. Japan also has the same problem. Why would people have more children if they clearly know they cannot afford it? They will ultimately move towards illegal abortion, temporary sterlization and other means of birth control: all which result in marginally the same birth rate. In the end you haven't solved your problem. \n \n If you want to raise the birth rate, you need to have better incentives then that. Better, cheaper education, lower taxes, greater job opportunities, cheaper housing, there are a large list of things. Banning abortion won't increase the birth rate to a degree that is helpful. \n \n The US is a nation of immigrants. Doesn't that tell you something?",
