   "'Media Matters' Exposes Myths, Pens Open Letter to Media About Lies and Distortions on 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n \n Some great work from Media Matters today in a posting detailing the Myths and Falsehoods on 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'. \n \n Dadt Media Matters (with a coalition of groups and individuals) also penned a letter to the media advising them to be wary of distortions regarding the military gay ban and its repeal.\n \n Wrote MM:\n \n Don't Ask, Don't Tell proponents too often paint a distorted picture of what a repeal would mean. Today, Media Matters for America released a comprehensive review detailing how opinion pages and cable news talk shows have been flooded with falsehoods and anti-gay rhetoric to support the dubious argument that Don't Ask, Don't Tell is working.\n \n Myths that repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell would adversely affect unit cohesion, retention, or the HIV rate among servicemembers are not based in reality. Similarly, the anti-gay rhetoric permeating many of these arguments only serves to cheapen the national discussion on this important issue.\n \n Because news outlets continue to repeat these outrageous myths, a coalition of organizations is banding together to combat misinformation about the Don't Ask, Don't Tell law. As Congress moves forward on this legislation, we will be vigilant in ensuring that news reports are accurate and fair. The public deserves an honest debate -- not one marred by blatant falsehoods and anti-gay attacks.",

   "I still would like to see the issue of repealing the \"don't ask\" part of DADT be addressed by gay pride proponents. Again, since it's impossible to know statistics on how many gays have bee HELPED by a policy which forbids the military from asking, and only stats about where they HAVE asked can be known, no study is going to be sufficient to know how this will truly affect gays.",

Again, since it's impossible to know statistics on how many gays have bee HELPED by a policy which forbids the military from asking, and only stats about where they HAVE asked can be known, no study is going to be sufficient to know how this will truly affect gays.\n\n \n The two main reasons to repeal DADT is thus far. One, it is discriminatory especially when you have top military commanders including Admiral Mullen stating that sexuality does not affect a members ability to serve.\n \n And also from a pure logistical standpoint.

I'm impressed that you're looking at the fiscal costs of these matters: an issue often neglected.\n Let's also think, for a moment, about the fiscal, cohesive, and morale issues if the \"don't ask\" part of the policy is removed. (Which it will be if DADT is rescinded). Personnel could then ask \"are you gay\" with no repercussions that I know of. Then there is the stress of servicepeople knowing there are homosexual servicepeople in their barracks, showers, etc., as well as who they are, and that these homosexual men and women may be attracted to them. There is the potential for serious issues there. \n Then there is the problem of homophobic commanding officers who would now be able to ask directly if a service person is gay, in front of their peers, I might add. \n There are some real potential problems here that need to at least be addressed before this policy is just pulled willy-nilly.",
