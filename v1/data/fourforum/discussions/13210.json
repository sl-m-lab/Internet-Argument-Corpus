   "The New Yorker has hired Amelia Lester, most recently an editor at the Paris Review, as their new managing editor.\n \n The New Yorker is my favourite magazine, I am waiting to see in what direction she moves the magazine. Some stories are far too long and don't merit so much real estate. Also the quality of short stories have dropped, although ocassionally some gems get printed\n \n Ms. Lester, 26, a Sydney native who graduated from Harvard, used to be a fact-checker at The New Yorker and checked all-star writers Sy Hersh and Jane Mayer.\n \n She's replacing Kate Julian, who is moving to Washington, D.C. where her husband just got a job.\n \n New York's other top Australian journalist is Col Allen, who moved from Sydney's Telegraph to edit the New York Post.\n \n Amelia Lester | The New Yorker | Sydneysider picked to run New Yorker",
