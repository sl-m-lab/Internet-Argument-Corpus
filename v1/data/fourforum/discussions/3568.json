A year and a half after our initial invasion we have 130,000 combat troops fighting deadly insurgents on a daily basis and we're committed to being there through next year. Now maybe you can make another \"enlightening\" comparison, but this time use the financial cost of the war. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Obviously, one can run a Cost/Benefit Analysis on a war based on whether the amount of lives lost is worth the benefit gained. But that isn't the ONLY way to measure the morality or advisibility of a war. I'd imagine we could \"take over\" Canada in approx. 8 hours if we nuked the place, and with zero American casualties. That wouldn't make it just. Wars are more complex than that.\n \n Democrats, too, need to understand that warfare and international politics are more complex than whether X attacked us. In Korea, for example, our action was both anti-communist, and humaniterean: we were stopping a foreign aggression against a sovereign state. I'd say that was a just action, even though we weren't \"attacked\" per se. Similarly, I'd say the war in Iraq was justified on humaniterean grounds, the US cannot sit idly by and tacitly consent to the oppression of people by a murderous dictator who is guilty of genocide and still call itself the leader of the free world.\n \n None of that, however, proves that Bush has done a good, or even remotely competent job of fighting this war. Again, it goes beyond simple body counts. Whether or not we are \"succeeding\" in Iraq is a direct function of how likely it is that country is going to end up as a stable, functional democracy. If it becomes a new haven for terrrorists, then we are losing even if we don't incur a single new casualty. If it replaces its old dictator with a new dictator, we've failed even if we don't incur a single new casualty. The proper measure of Bush's policies in post-war Iraq is whether or not they've been facilitative of our goals for the region: Democratization and Anti-terrorism. The fact is, they haven't been. They haven't been because our hubris has turned the local population against us. They haven't because our spurning of offered international assistance has reinforced the perception that this is an imperial mission. They haven't because the interim government loses credibilty every time it identifies itself with the US. They haven't because increasingly, democrats in the region like Ayatollah Ali Sistani are viewing the US as an obstacle, rather than an aid, to democracy. They haven't because the situation in Iraq has deteriorated to the point where the National Intelligence Estimate foresees a reasonable chance that the country will fall into civil war. All of these issues are problems for which the Bush administration can, and must, be held culpable.\n \n This is a new type of war. That it can be fought with a minimum of US casualties is praiseworthy, and wonderful. But that doesn't change the fact that we can still lose it. George W. Bush is losing the war in Iraq, and as someone who supported the war and still is aware of its tremendous importance in the war on terror and the global effort for democritization, I cannot in good caution give him a free pass on his mismanagement.",
