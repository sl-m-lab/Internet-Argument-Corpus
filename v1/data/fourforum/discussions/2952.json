My first \"crush\" was on my nursery school bus driver (and no she never treated me different than anyone else in my nusery school class). I've never been attracted to men. I have nothing against men, they just aren't for me. Perhaps we just haven't found \"scientific proof\" of people being gay. Maybe we are just wired differently in the brain and haven't found the link. In any case, I believe I've always been gay. I'm also not looking for religious approval for who I am. I am a reconstructionist Jew and my rabbi has no problem with me being a lesbian. It's the secular part of society that denies me the secular marriage that I seek. I'm not expecting the bible to justify homosexuality...it just isn't in there in the first place as interpreted by my faith.\n \n other than that, i think gays should be free to choose their sexual partners and habits, and the rest of society should respect their choice of philosophy, as any other group that chooses a philosophy, as long as it doesnt interfere with other people's rights.\n \n I don't see how me building a family interfere's with other people's rights.

Sure we can override some of the benefits through wills, financial planning, and family planning, and name changes through the legal system. But some of the rights are still not guaranteed like they would be through marriage. In some instances, I wouldn't be able to visit my partner in the hospital because I wasn't a \"member of the family\" legally. Also, the rights that we would work to gain would have to be through the legal system which is expensive. A name change...over $1,000, will...$800. That's just the beginning!

   "I disagree with your statement that nobody was born gay. My first \"crush\" was on my nursery school bus driver (and no she never treated me different than anyone else in my nusery school class). I've never been attracted to men. I have nothing against men, they just aren't for me. Perhaps we just haven't found \"scientific proof\" of people being gay. Maybe we are just wired differently in the brain and haven't found the link. In any case, I believe I've always been gay. I'm also not looking for religious approval for who I am. I am a reconstructionist Jew and my rabbi has no problem with me being a lesbian. It's the secular part of society that denies me the secular marriage that I seek. I'm not expecting the bible to justify homosexuality...it just isn't in there in the first place as interpreted by my faith.\n\n genetics dont dictate or predict sexual preference. neither does chemical composition, physical attributes, or any other \"born-with\" feature. admit it or not, you acquired an attraction for females, subconciously or through some experience, but it had nothing to do with genetics. and being attracted to the same sex, even at a young age, is normal in most children. but this does not mean that that person will go on to be sexually attracted to that sex enough to declare themselves gay\n \n \nI don't see how me building a family interfere's with other people's rights. Straight people could still marry.\n\n it doesnt, except in infringes on some people's \"philosophical space\" if such a thing exists. suffice it to say that not everyone holds the same philosophy, and thats basically all that its about\n \n \nI believe that gay people are being denied the 1,048 rights that married people get when they say \"I do\". Sure we can override some of the benefits through wills, financial planning, and family planning, and name changes through the legal system. But some of the rights are still not guaranteed like they would be through marriage. In some instances, I wouldn't be able to visit my partner in the hospital because I wasn't a \"member of the family\" legally. Also, the rights that we would work to gain would have to be through the legal system which is expensive. A name change...over $1,000, will...$800. That's just the beginning! Cost of a marriage license is reasonable compared to this.\n\n the reason why i say there is no \"denial\" of rights involved is because there were rights for gays to marry in the first place, so the right was never taken away. the law recognises a man and woman as a legal marriage, thats the way it always has been. gays cannot demand rights that are contrary to established law, and they cannot feel discriminated against because the establish law didnt accomodate their wishes. however, like i said, there is due course to get the laws adjusted, and thats what you should be concerned with pursuing. at the same time, people that are against adjusting those laws have the same right to lobby against gays being married.",

   "i have no problems with gays, in terms of their sexual choice and lifestyle, but i do have a few problems with the way plead for social support. first of all, nobody is born gay. there is no genetic predisposition that makes anybody gay. second, gays cannot be equated with race. gays adhere to a psychological ideal, just as do christians, muslims or navy seals. they can choose to continue in the habits, or they can find alternatives. third, gays need to stop looking for religious approval for their lifestyles. its unrealistic to expect the bible to justify homosexuality.\n\n \n Alrighty, lets get a few things straightened out here. There is NO scientific backing as to why people are born left-handed, but they still are and no one questions it. At least not anymore. The same is true for gays. Time to just accept the inevidable and get on with life. \n Second, how you are able to equate Navy Seals with religion is just too funny to comment, except to point out just how humorous it is. Religion is NOT a psychological ideal, it's a religious ideal, or don't you know the difference? A habit is picking your nose in public, how you use your mouth to kiss, cracking your knuckles...etc. Being gay is certainly NOT a habit.\n Third; gays are not looking for religious acceptance. There are churches/congregations which do accept gays, but the focus of acceptance which gays are looking for is LEGAL. \n \n \n {QUOTE=unkerpaulie]other than that, i think gays should be free to choose their sexual partners and habits, and the rest of society should respect their choice of philosophy, as any other group that chooses a philosophy, as long as it doesnt interfere with other people's rights.[/QUOTE]\n \n The fact is gays do have the freedom to choose their partners. They do NOT have the freedom to be recognized LEGALLY as being in a committed relationship. This is what the GLBT community is trying to change. \n \n \nas for the question of marriage, gays are not being denied any rights. it has always been the legal standard for a man and woman to constitute a married couple. not that gays are being barred from marriage, the laws have not been adjusted. if the legal system sees it fit to adjust the laws of marriage, then those laws will be adjusted. it is not in the hands of christians or gays, but each side has a right to lobby for what they think the law should be, and the judiciary system will have the final say ultimately\n\n \n OYE. Actually gays are BARRED from marrying, THE PARTNER OF THEIR CHOICE. Would it be fair to bar heterosexuals from marrying someone of the opposite gender? NO\n The \"adjustments\" of which you speak are exactly what the GLBT community is trying to get done. The legal recognition of their commitments just as heterosexuals are recognized for theirs. \n What people also forget is that in many states gays are still being barred from due process in that they have no legal recorce when fired for the PERSEPTION of being gay. They have no backing when denied perminant &/or temporary housing (apartments & hotel/motel rooms). These are also issues which are being fought over in many states.",

Simple high school science proves that wrong.\n\n \n I'm not a genetic biologist, nor am I a statistician, but it would seem to me that a gay gene is certainly within the realm of possibility.\n \n Furthermore, I believe in a strong genetic link to much of human behaviour. Anyone who has watched children grow up, especially multiple children within a single household or even extended family, has seen how each child develops differently and displays different characteristics, often very similar to those of a specific parent/grandparent, despite growing up in the same family under the same conditions. \n \n In addition, I think the animal kingdom gives rise to pretty strong evidence that genetics have a strong influence on behaviour.\n \n The argument that homosexuals would produce no offspring and thus a gay gene would die out is not viable. Even today, many people with strong homosexual tendencies produce offspring.\n \n Numerous physical features that humans have, everything from eye/hair color to just plain poor eyesight have no real physical advantage when it comes to \"evolution\" and yet the traits are continuously passed on, and continuously mutating.\n \n Also you're arguing that the gene is not capable of being randomly created more than once. The perpetuation of a gene does not necessarily require the continued passing on of said gene in a specific population. If there is a fairly \"high\" probability of such a mutation occuring, it can be randomly created and inserted into gene structures throughout history.\n \n unkerpaulie - I disagree with your assertion that being homosexual requires engaging in homosexual sex.

The same is true for gays. Time to just accept the inevidable and get on with life. \n Second, how you are able to equate Navy Seals with religion is just too funny to comment, except to point out just how humorous it is. Religion is NOT a psychological ideal, it's a religious ideal, or don't you know the difference? A habit is picking your nose in public, how you use your mouth to kiss, cracking your knuckles...etc. Being gay is certainly NOT a habit.\n Third; gays are not looking for religious acceptance. There are churches/congregations which do accept gays, but the focus of acceptance which gays are looking for is LEGAL.\n\n i have a 19 month old son. he is at the age where his motor skills are developing rapidly. at about 12 months and less he would grasp objects with whatever hand was closer. no hand preference whatsoever. i actively and conscoiusly put objects in his right hand to help him develop the muscles and nerve control in that hand. that is fundamentaly what handed-ness is. nobody is hard-wired to use one hand, and people change their handedness when the need arises, by simply conciously developing that hand skill\n \n \nOYE. Actually gays are BARRED from marrying, THE PARTNER OF THEIR CHOICE. Would it be fair to bar heterosexuals from marrying someone of the opposite gender? NO\n The \"adjustments\" of which you speak are exactly what the GLBT community is trying to get done. The legal recognition of their commitments just as heterosexuals are recognized for theirs. \n What people also forget is that in many states gays are still being barred from due process in that they have no legal recorce when fired for the PERSEPTION of being gay. They have no backing when denied perminant &/or temporary housing (apartments & hotel/motel rooms). These are also issues which are being fought over in many states.\n\n there was never a law that permits you to marry the \"partner of your choice\". in fact, such a clause could reek havoc legally. \n \n as for being fired for being gay, unless the employers can prove that your behavior is hindering your work performance, then its pure discrimination. it is similar to firing someone for being a muslim or a democrat, when that person's work performance has been up to standard.",

The perpetuation of a gene does not necessarily require the continued passing on of said gene in a specific population.

   "Let me provide science!\n \n \n What is behavioral genetics? \n [text provided by Joseph McInerney]\n \n Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911) was the first scientist to study heredity and human behavior systematically. The term \"genetics\" did not even appear until 1909, only 2 years before Galton's death. With or without a formal name, the study of heredity always has been, at its core, the study of biological variation. Human behavioral genetics, a relatively new field, seeks to understand both the genetic and environmental contributions to individual variations in human behavior. This is not an easy task, for the following reasons. \n \n It often is difficult to define the behavior in question. Intelligence is a classic example. Is intelligence the ability to solve a certain type of problem? The ability to make one's way successfully in the world? The ability to score well on an IQ test? During the late summer of 1999, a Princeton molecular biologist published the results of impressive research in which he enhanced the ability of mice to learn by inserting a gene that codes for a protein in brain cells known to be associated with memory. Because the experimental animals performed better than controls on a series of traditional tests of learning, the press dubbed this gene \"the smart gene\" and the \"IQ gene,\" as if improved memory were the central, or even sole, criterion for defining intelligence. In reality, there is no universal agreement on the definition of intelligence, even among those who study it for a living.\n \n \n Having established a definition for research purposes, the investigator still must measure the behavior with acceptable degrees of validity and reliability. That is especially difficult for basic personality traits such as shyness or assertiveness, which are the subject of much current research. Sometimes there is an interesting conflation of definition and measurement, as in the case of IQ tests, where the test score itself has come to define the trait it measures. This is a bit like using batting averages to define hitting prowess in baseball. A high average may indicate ability, but it does not define the essence of the trait.\n \n \n Behaviors, like all complex traits, involve multiple genes, a reality that complicates the search for genetic contributions.\n \n \n As with much other research in genetics, studies of genes and behavior require analysis of families and populations for comparison of those who have the trait in question with those who do not. The result often is a statement of \"heritability,\" a statistical construct that estimates the amount of variation in a population that is attributable to genetic factors. The explanatory power of heritability figures is limited, however, applying only to the population studied and only to the environment in place at the time the study was conducted. If the population or the environment changes, the heritability most likely will change as well. Most important, heritability statements provide no basis for predictions about the expression of the trait in question in any given individual. \n \n \n Source: http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/behavior.shtml",

The tape shows that he was mostly a bystander for most of the incident, and most of the planning. \n \n People are predisposed to becoming suicide bombers based on their innate personalities. They can't just pick any kid off the street and send them to their death. They carefully select the right recruits. Furthermore, suicide bombers are generally not acting of their own free will, or perhaps more accurately, are not acting based on their own thoughts. They have been \"programmed\" to carry out an act that is contrary to all logic. \n \n I'm not sure why you find it so hard to believe that genetics play a role. It seems so incredibly logical to me that your refusal to accept it seems completely illogical. I have no problem accepting that genetics are not the ONLY factor, I think environment also plays a major role. I would NEVER rule out environment as a contributing factor. Simply because YOU can't imagine or understand how such genes could be identified or tracked, by no means rules out the possibility, or even likelihood, that they will someday be tracked and mapped. Could you envision DNA testing or the mapping of the human genome 20 or 30 years ago? Could you take your computer apart and put it back together again?

   "More science\n \n \n \n \n Neither a wholly genetic nor a learning-based explanation fits for handedness. Here are some of the facts, and what they mean.\n \n Handedness runs in families. If both parents are right-handed, 92 to 96 percent of their children will be right-handed, too. If both parents are left-handed, 45 to 50 percent of their children will be left-handed (which also means that roughly half will still be right-handed). When one parent is a lefty and the other a righty, about 80 percent of their children will be right-handed. All of the above fits nicely with a genetic explanation.\n \n \n Of course, the fact that handedness runs in families could be explained by learning. Since most people in society are right-handed, right-handed parents would have an easy time teaching their children to be right-handed. Left-handed parents would be working against the tide, and so a greater percentage of children would turn out right-handed, despite their parents' efforts. But what the learning explanation can't explain is why any children of right-handed parents would turn out to be left-handed! Also, very young infants show left- or right-sided preferences (see How Handedness Develops in Infants) that are related to their eventual handedness. It's hard to imagine that parents are teaching their children these things.\n \n \n Among adopted children, the patterns of handedness are related to their biological parents, not their adoptive ones--more strong support for a genetic cause.\n \n \n On the other hand, the evidence from studies of twins goes against genetics. Identical twins, who develop from a single egg, share the same genes. Fraternal twins, who develop from two different eggs, have about half of their genes in common. If genes were directly responsible for handedness, you'd expect identical twins to always have the same handedness--both being either right-handed or left-handed. You would think that fraternal twins, however, would only have the same likelihood of handedness as any other siblings.\n \n In fact, the number of pairs where one twin is left-handed and the other right is about 20 to 30 percent regardless of whether they're identical or not. To further complicate the matter, there is controversy about a possible connection between left-handedness and twinning (which I won't get into!), but that doesn't change the fact that straightforward genetics can't account for how identical twins can be so different when it comes to handedness.\n \n \n \n source http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,5817,00.html?r=related",

What factors do you feel would have driven that development?\n \n IMHO, handedness is a prime example of natural development due to genetics. Everyone has a dominant hand, dominant leg, even a dominant eye. Try as you might, you will never change that fact.\n \n You can put things in your child's right hand all you want, when that child goes to write, throw a ball, or grab a hockey stick for the first time, the naturally dominant hand will take over. My middle brother is left handed by nature, I'm right handed. The forced him to write right handed in school, and he gets by. My dad tried to get him to play hockey right handed, (to save money on sticks :p ) but no dice, give him a left handed stick and he was 10X better, no question.\n \n You can train a child, or even a grown man, to gain more dexterity with their non-dominant hand, but never, or perhaps VERY rarely, is anyone truly ambidextrous.\n \n In that way, I see it as being somewhat analagous to homosexuality. A person can change if they are forced to, but the natural tendency can never be changed.\n \n Waxy\n\n in my opinion, the hand that interacts with the most objects most frequently would end up being the dominant hand\n \n i think i'll drop the handedness issue, because even though my personal experience tells me otherwise, i cant support this with anything but personal experience. but even with that, it doesnt change anything about the nature of homosexuality, or the nature of any personality or identity pattern",

   "I'll try to find the link to the article.\n \n One boy was a bonafide psycopath, the other was simpy a lonely kid who was trying to fit in and got caught up with the wrong guy. The tape shows that he was mostly a bystander for most of the incident, and most of the planning. \n \n People are predisposed to becoming suicide bombers based on their innate personalities. They can't just pick any kid off the street and send them to their death. They carefully select the right recruits. Furthermore, suicide bombers are generally not acting of their own free will, or perhaps more accurately, are not acting based on their own thoughts. They have been \"programmed\" to carry out an act that is contrary to all logic. \n \n I'm not sure why you find it so hard to believe that genetics play a role. It seems so incredibly logical to me that your refusal to accept it seems completely illogical. I have no problem accepting that genetics are not the ONLY factor, I think environment also plays a major role. I would NEVER rule out environment as a contributing factor. Simply because YOU can't imagine or understand how such genes could be identified or tracked, by no means rules out the possibility, or even likelihood, that they will someday be tracked and mapped. Could you envision DNA testing or the mapping of the human genome 20 or 30 years ago? Could you take your computer apart and put it back together again? I know I couldn't.\n \n You cite a lack of scientific evidence - I have never seen any scientific proof that only environment shapes our identity and behaviour. I don't have the inclination to Google this topic, but maybe someone will.\n \n Waxy\n\n a bonafide psychopath doesnt imply heredity or built-in. he was completely psychopathic, i agree. my view is that he indoctrinated that psychology into himself, in the same way suicide bombers are indoctrinated by religious radicals and charismatic cult heads\n \n like i said, maybe its me, but in my observations of my own life, i had to actively and consciously accept or reject the elements that make up my personality. identities change, personalities are augmented. i have seen this in my own life. i know that i could personally completely change my mentality on nearly anything. whether it be sexual preference, respect for elders, political ideal, even religious suasion, they are all variable, and the only reason i selected these traits for my personality is because they were the most advantageous to adopt at the time.\n \n maybe everybody isnt like that, or perhaps they dont believe that there are people like that. with this in mind, i can understand why they would feel strongly that personality is hard-wired and unchangeable.",

Everyone is free to marry a member the opposite sex. That right is the same for everyone, bar none. Nobody is free to marry a member of the same sex. That restriction is the same for everyone, bar none. The same sex restriction is by no means the only restriction as we all know and if you think we must sanction same sex marriage in order to uphold civil rights than the civil rights of people with any number of unusual or different sexual preferences would also have to be upheld. We would literally have to legalize the marriage of blood relatives as well as adults to minors in order to protect the \"rights\" of those engaged in incest or statutory rape because that is their preference.

   "Ok, I've got one.\n \n Pretty much by definition, being gay means being attracted to people your own sex. However...\n \n When I lived in San Francisco, I would go to the Castro (that's the gay hub of the city, for those who don't know SF) and there would be dozens of gay men, all wearing leather caps, short hair, mustaches, white tank tops, tight shorts (leather or denim), and boots. It was like a uniform. Go to a gay club or party with a gay host and ABBA would definately be played. Have a Liza Minelli film festival and the seats would be full of gay men. So, in other words, if you were gay in SF it meant you liked men, leather caps, ABBA, and Liza. What's up with that? Why does your sexual preference have such a strong influence on all your other tastes?\n\n \n Try going further out to the suburbs. I dare you to identify the gays from the straights.\n What you fail to notice is that gays don't all live in \"Gay Ghetos\" such as the Castro, DuPont Circle (D.C.) or Boystown (Chicago).\n I wouldn't be shocked to find out the person you sit next to every Sunday at church might be gay/lesbian. \n The firefighters who save the lives of those stranded in burning buildings. The pharmasist who you entrust to always fill your prescriptions.\n etc...\n \n \n The thing about urban gays is that it's a social structure thing.

   "In reality, no scientific studies show an inborn cause for any such complex behaviors as homosexuality. In this day of shirking responsibility and blaming anything but ourselves for our actions, claims that someone is genetically or chemically structured to engage in dangerous or antisocial activities find increasing appeal.\n\n \n Again with that lame argument about \"no scientific cause\"? I really would have thought you might have realized that it's outdated on this thread. We have already shown numerous examples of other human behavior which has no \"scientific\" cause, but is widely accepted. \n And since when are gays Anti-social? Let alone dangerous.\n \n The ones who are displaying anti-social and dangerous behaviors are those staunch gay-haters who collect guns and beat gays to death. \n \n \nNot only is the scientific research that tries to prove an inborn nature to homosexuality questionable, but the researchers also fail to take into account the existence of thousands of former homosexuals. If homosexuality were biologically determined, it would seem impossible for homosexuals to become heterosexual.\n\n \n And you call our research is \"questionable\"? Yeah, right. When all supposed \"conversion/repairative\" therapies are religious based, that is what I call questionable. \n Homosexuals don't become \"Ex-Gay\" they simple deny their NATURE and live against it. Most of those supposed Ex-gays usually return to living as themselves/gay within a months or sometimes a few years. Very few of them remain \"ex-gay\" for the durration of their lives. \n Even the two leaders of Exodus International (The US leader and UK leader) reverted back to their natural gay selves, stating that it was a lie they could no longer maintain. \n The APA (American Psychological Association) actually warns against such faith based therapies stating that almost none of them have facilitator with any kind of psychology training whatsoever. They are faith based groups which rely on heavily shaming gays into becomming something they are not. \n \n \nScientists have not even come close to proving a genetic or biological cause for homosexuality, yet homosexual activists continue to say that sexual activity between members of the same sex is \"just the same\" as race or gender. Without scientific evidence to support such claims, it is wrong and dangerously misleading to say that people are born homosexual and cannot change.\n\n \n It's also dangerous to mislead people into living lies.\n To force a person to become what he/she is not leads to depression, anti-social behavior, self-hate and even violent tendencies. \n Would you want the next \"Columbine\" style inncodent to be on your head?",

   "Ok it's time for a genetics lesson. Say your father and mother are both gay and carry the dominant gene for \"gayness\". They have a kid. There is a 25% chance the kid will be homozygous dominant for \"gayness\", a 25% chance that the kid will not carry any of the \"gayness\" gene, and there is a 50% chance that the kid will heterozygous dominant. The straight sibling is the one that doesn't carry any of the \"gayness\" gene. Therefore, the \"gayness\" gene stops with him. \n \n \n Scenario. The family above has 4 kids. The gene for \"gayness\" is g. The dad is Gg (he carries the recessive because he is straight) and the mom is Gg (she carries the recessive because she is straight). Do a Punnit square. Here are the results:\n \n \n 1 kid will be GG (straight, with no \"gayness\" gene at all)\n 2 kids will be Gg (straight, carriers of the \"gayness\" gene)\n 1 kid will be gg (completely gay kid)\n \n \n None of those kids can produce gay children. The GG and Gg are all straight, so they will presumably marry a straight person and have straight kids. The gg person is gay, so he won't have any kids with a straight person because he is gay. That just shows how quickly it can die off. This doesn't assume test tube babies, but it is still very unlikely that if there is a gay gene, it can last long at all.\n\n \n Okay, first off, a \"gay gene\" (which I believe exists) would be made of several genes that require all to be present and \"active\" to cause homosexuality.\n \n Secondly, if we take your simplified example, you really need a refresher on genetics. You totally ignore that the two straight kids with Gg can have gay children, just like the original couple, if they join with someone else with Gg, so NO, it WOULDN'T die off quickly. Your assubption that the Gg kids, being straight, would have straight kids, as you ignore the fact that two OTHER Gg straights married and produced THESE kids. :xbanghead",

   "Okay, first off, a \"gay gene\" (which I believe exists) would be made of several genes that require all to be present and \"active\" to cause homosexuality.\n \n Secondly, if we take your simplified example, you really need a refresher on genetics. You totally ignore that the two straight kids with Gg can have gay children, just like the original couple, if they join with someone else with Gg, so NO, it WOULDN'T die off quickly. Your assubption that the Gg kids, being straight, would have straight kids, as you ignore the fact that two OTHER Gg straights married and produced THESE kids. :xbanghead\n\n \n I believe that science will find that having a homosexual orientation is linked to hormonal conditional inside the womb. If it were just a gene, then it would probably have been bred out of existence long ago by natural selection. I think science in on the right track. It has something do to with chemicals and hormones in the mother's womb. Lesz posted a good article the other day on this very subject. And my hair whorl is counter clockwise. Duh.",
