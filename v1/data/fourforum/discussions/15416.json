This is how we got the idea that lower tax rates will always generate MORE revenue. A silly theory proven wrong numerous times over.\n\n \n Yes I'd say Europe and Canada average about 30% less income per capita than the US, but not figured in is that income from the stone age to here is determined exclusively by new inventions \"supplied\" by American capitalism. Most inventions come from the American freedom and liberty that fosters entrepreneurialism, without which the socialist dullard nations that we created, sustain, and police would have perhaps 20% of the per capita income we have. Instead, they have 70% because capitalism distributes inventions in an incredibly broad and nearly instantaneous way.\n \n Say's Law ( the origin of supply side economics) says that supply generates its own demand and so simultaneously increases ones standard of living. First, you have two farmers each growing enough to just sustain themselves, then one invents a tool so the other can trade for it, with his food, to more than double his production. Then you have one farmer, one tool maker, and two people with a higher, broader standard of living.\n Democrats lack the IQ to understand this and so don't encourage supply. This diminishes our standard of living. In fact, by interfering with suppliers through taxes, regulations, and demand side economics, they actually diminish productivity and therefore everyone's standard of living.\n \n \n Vision: Demand Creates Jobs\n \n J: actually supply ceates jobs!! \n \n Two men are farmers 10,000 years ago. They both demand a 12 hour day rather than the standard 16 hour day. Nothing happens for 5000 years until one man supplies a plow.\n \n Supply of new innovative products creates new jobs, economic growth, and rising standards of living. We got from the stone age to here not by demand but by supply. We all demand heaven, but few actually supply it!\n \n Now you know all about Say's Law or supply side economics.",

A tenured university geek would not have a chance next to them.\n\n \n The science behind genetics was researched in universties I believe so publicly funded research is at least partly responsible for private reward.\n So a private guy would refine the technology and market it..as I said and you confirmed above.\n Also I believe quite a few universty Joes have worked around the clock for little reward on quite a few projects that may have no certain future.\n I dont disagree with most of what you say but I dont agree that private companies are responsible for ALL the wealth in a country and public funded research consists of some research and guesses",

Quite why you're not capable of using google (or even just having some basic knowledge of famous scientific discoveries) to find this out I don't know.\n\n \n \n actually I did use google and it made you look like a prejudiced liberal liar:\n \n wiki: Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections.[6][7] More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between micro-organisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed that, \"if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics\".[8]\n The term antibiosis, meaning \"against life,\" was introduced by the French bacteriologist Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs.[9][10] Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis.[11] These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by Selman Waksman, an American microbiologist in 1942.[3][9]\n \n Antagonistic activities by fungi against bacteria were first described in England by John Tyndall in 1875.[8] Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s.[9] Ehrlich noted that certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, while others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the synthetic antibacterial Salvarsan.[9][12][13] In 1928, Alexander Fleming observed antibiosis against bacteria by a fungus of the genus 'Penicillium'. Fleming postulated that the effect was mediated by an antibacterial compound named penicillin and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterized some of its biological properties, but he did not pursue its further development.[14][15] Prontosil, the first commercially available antibacterial antibiotic, was developed by a research team led by Gerhard Domagk in 1932 (who received the 1939 Nobel Prize for Medicine for his efforts) at the Bayer Laboratories of the IG Farben conglomerate in Germany.",

Penicillin was re-discovered by bacteriologist Alexander Fleming working at St. Mary's Hospital in London in 1928.\n So you see, Fleming didn't make his discovery at the University of London but at St Mary's Hospital. Also, rather than attempting to sound like some deep well of information, why not just post the links to the sources you post your info from? It is much more honest you know.\n \n To summarize, (From the link) even though In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming observed that colonies of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus could be destroyed by the mold Penicillium notatum, proving that there was an antibacterial agent there in principle. This principle later lead to medicines that could kill certain types of disease-causing bacteria inside the body.\n At the time, however, the importance of Alexander Fleming's discovery was not known. Use of penicillin did not begin until the 1940s when Howard Florey and Ernst Chain isolated the active ingredient and developed a powdery form of the medicine.",

It is an economic philosophy that supports and promotes laissez-faire economics and private property in the means of production. Although economic liberalism can be supportive of government regulation to a certain degree, it tends to oppose government intervention in the free market when it inhibits free trade and open competition. Economic liberalism opposes economic planning as an alternative to the market mechanism.

   "That's because Republicans don't know how to balance a budget and asking to make debt Illegal is a stupid Idea and would never be possible in the real world. Dwight Eisenhower was last Republican President to preside over a balanced budget. He had a balanced budget in 1956 and 1957. Since then, there have been two presidents to preside over balanced budgets, LBJ in 1969 and Clinton in 1998 through 2001. During the last 40 years there have been five budget surpluses, all five were under Democratic Presidents: 1969, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. So as You can see the Democrats Like Jefferson are the one's who know how to balance a budget.. and once the Repubs and teabaggers are sent packing in 2012 they'll have to prove it again .\nBudget bills start in the House which was Republican in 1998, 99, 2000, 2001 (FY years). The largest deficit increases have come with Democrats controlling the House...again, where the budget originates. \n \n Your attempt to pin it on only Republicans (who have a large amount of blame) is silly and to think Democrats would change this is even worse.\n \n \nThe GOP are the evil ones.. they drive the bus into the ditch with 8 years of spending sprees and now they try to blame it on the democrats.. Won't work though, people are on to their game.\nSix years of spending sprees. The democrats then did four more years of spending sprees. Prior to 95 it was once again democrats who controlled congress and specifically the House which, once again, shows democrats can rack up the debt as well. \n \n So which party can balance the budget? Neither...but we had a congress that did it, kinda, in the 90s.",

When we started running deficits.. The Tax Cuts weren't just as simple as cutting taxes.. They also increased spending by handing out billions in Tax credits to Billionaires. The Decrease in Revenues, + two wars + 2 failed Stimulus bills + Medicare Part D + Wall street bail outs + Airline Bailouts = Massive debt. All started by cutting the Revenues without any plan to replace the lost revenues.

This\n fiscal fact sheet by the non-partisan Pew\n Fiscal Analysis Initiative - building on\n an earlier analysis published in No Silver\n Bullet: Paths for Reducing the Federal Debt -\n shows that the main drivers of the debt,\n by far, are the tax cuts and spending\n increases enacted since 2001.\n \n Over a ten year period yes, increased spending has surpassed the overall amount that the Tax cuts cost. We were forced to INCREASE spending because of the tax cuts. The TAX cuts led us to INCREASE Spending.. Which Means the TAX cuts Are the Biggest reason we went into Deficits. You didn't prove anything wrong with this report. If Bush had not cut the revenues we may or may not have ended up with Deficits anyway because of the wars. But Not being able to pay for those wars because of decreased INCOME is what led us into the ditch.. \n \n \n\n No, that's NOT what you said. That's not what \"biggest\" means. \n \n \n Oh.. my bad, let me reword that to make it right...\n \nNo, I said the Bush Tax cuts are the Biggest Reason we went from a budget surplus to a budget deficit, which started the ball rolling on the massive debt.\n \n \n \n\n WRONG. A tax credit is NOT a spending increase.\n \n \n When you have to Borrow more Money to make up for giving someone a tax credit for a private Jet You increase your spending. Some tax credits and subsidies DO lead to an increase in spending or at the least a bigger deficit. \n \n \n\n As this debate roles along I'm seeing the true side of some of the members of this forum.

I'm all for tax increases but unlike you I understand the consequences and realize that more spending increases are needed than tax increases. In fact, you can almost say 41% spending reductions and 27% tax increases.\n\n \n I agree we need to spend more now to spur the economy. Instead of arguing over whether or not to raise the debt limit they should be investing in Infrastructure and stimulus, but increasing revenues will be needed before they will ever be able to balance the budget. As long as they are spending more than they are taking in, which forces them to borrow more so they can spend more, then tack on the added interest from borrowing more .. I'd still say Tax increases are the best way to accomplish a balance budget. \n Don't get me wrong, there are many things that need to be done, I'm not suggesting just raise taxes and then hope for the best.. But I am saying any economic recovery we expect to see will start with eliminating the Bush era tax policies and eliminating many subsidies and tax credits to the corporations.",

   "So you admit you're wrong then. Increased spending was the biggest reason for our deficit issues. \n \n \n No I am not wrong. I never said The Bush Tax cuts were responsible for our current Deficit Problems, I said the Bush Tax Cuts were what started the ball rolling downhill and the Biggest reason we went from a budget surplus to a budget deficit in the first place. The Increased spending didn't help but spending was not what got us to the point of deficits . If you go back you will see that government spending was relatively the same before the wars yet we were still running a deficit Because Bush Cut Taxes and decreased revenue. I stand by my statement that the Bush Tax cuts are the BIGGEST reason we are now in debt up to our ears. We have no way of knowing whether or not we would still be in this shape had the tax cuts not happened . At the time the Revenue coming in was paying the bills and then some. Cutting revenues caused the deficits.. increased spending added to lower revenues made it worse.\n \n \n\n We've been over this before. I asked why you'd have to spend more when you took in less revenue. You said \"You don't necessarily\". In other words, increase spending is independent of tax cuts.\n\n \n Maybe in your world but not in the real world. When the Government doesn't have the Money to pay the bills they are forced to borrow more , which in turn increases the debt . It's the same as spending money we don't have. Tax cuts do lead to more spending. \n \n \n\n I proved 41% was due to increased spending and 27% to tax cuts thus making your argument wrong.\n \n \n And I agreed that over a 10 year period spending did surpass the tax cuts as far as the numbers go. It's still a fact that the Tax Cuts are The Biggest reason we are in debt considering those lost revenues which had to be replaced with more borrowing , which in turn led to more spending ... well you see where I'm going.\n \n \n \n This is just stupid. A tax credit is basically a revenue reduction to the government. If my tax rate is 10% and I have $20 with a $10 credit than my tax is $1.

We can also see that the budget deficit was caused by tax credits in the amount of $1 and increased spending in the amount of $2. \n \n \n Take the Child Tax credit for instance. A family with 2 children with a combined income of 65 thousand a year. When tax time rolls around and they file their returns first they take their standard deductions. Then the itemize and add in the Child Tax Credit. when all is said and done they owe the government 0 dollars. Ok this is fine.. They got a few breaks and now they don't owe any taxes. Oh but wait.. let's add on Earned Income Credit... and Give these folks about 4 thousand dollars that they did not pay in. That's money that the government has to SPEND , money which they don't have. \n \n Of course all tax credits aren't causing an increase in spending however there are some that cause more spending. The point is though that we are now taking in much less than we are paying out, and that is directly related to Revenue lost through ignorant tax cuts . \n \n \n \n\n You'd have to be either dishonest or a fool, and I'm trying to be nice, to not see how you're wrong here.

How you can just ignore this is beyond me. \n \n \nTax cuts do lead to more spending. \nUhhh, no.\n \n \nlost revenues which had to be replaced with more borrowing , which in turn led to more spending\n Uhh, no. Again, spending is not related to tax cuts.\n \n \nTake the Child Tax credit for instance. A family with 2 children with a combined income of 65 thousand a year.

Oh but wait.. let's add on Earned Income Credit... and Give these folks about 4 thousand dollars that they did not pay in. That's money that the government has to SPEND , money which they don't have. \nFirst off, you should know that tax refunds are NOT spending. This is an understandable mistake for those not in accounting. You gave an instance of a tax refund; lets have a look. Ok, and let's assume prior to the \"tax cut\" this person would have had taxes of $0. With the tax cut the government assumes you have negative taxes in the amount of $4,000. It is inconsistent to say if a tax goes from $4,000 to 0 it is counted as \"tax cut\" versus $0 to -$4,000 is counting as spending. If you don't believe me than take a look at any US budget bill and let me know if you see \"tax refunds\" as a spending line item. So on the study we will see Deficit increase due to TAX CUTS in the amount of $4,000. Again, this proves my point that tax cuts are NOT the same as spending. \n \n The only real way you increase spending with tax cuts is by maintaining spending at current levels and borrow the remainder causing more interest payments. This, however, would not change the results of our little analysis. \n \n \nI don't see that I'm wrong because I'm not wrong.\nYou really don't? I'm not the only one who finds this rather remarkable.

It is not, and some 'problems' by their definition cannot be morally solved. For instance I have heard it said that if some poor joe can't get a job, can't feed himself, can't move somewhere better; then regardless of 'normal' morality he must rob a bank, and until someone comes up for a solution to his plight apparently robbing the bank isn't really wrong for him. Similarly the immorality of taxation is not dependent on it's status or non-status as necessity for government. Observe:\n \n /It is necessary to tax for a government to exit.\n /Taxation is immoral.\n //Therefore government is immoral.\n \n Bingo, it doesn't matter how bad you think anarchy is; if you were correct that theft and slavery is the only non-anarchist state of man than anarchy is the moral choice.",
