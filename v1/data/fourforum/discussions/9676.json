   "Do you think God is a life form? A member of an omnipotent species residing in another dimention? This is kind of a silly question, but its a question I hope someone religious can answer.\n\n \n It's actually not a silly question.\n Most Word of Faith people (off shoot of Pentecostalism) believe that God IS like this.\n \n You'd know the WofF's from popular Evangelical/Fundamentalist of the US.\n They include Pat Robertson of the 700 Club, The entire line up of TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network...odd since most don't there don't believe in a Trinity) and the vast majority of Mega Churchs in the US are of this movement. \n The hypocrite Ted Haggard is one for example.\n Benny Hinn has described his looks and appearance. \n \n Until recently (and they may still be there) Youtube had videos of these individuals proclaiming such. They, being the hucksters they are, have writen such claims down in the books they sell. So, I'm not making it up.\n \n These of course, are amongst the fastest growing sect of 'Christianity' in the world, going everywhere it's possible to con a sucker out of a buck with legalized robbery and fraud. They pander to ones inate greed and/or dispair with a host of non bible based lies and distortions of scripture and their ministries often EACH rake in hundreds of millions a year.\n \n \n I wish I was making this up. And, while comical to many, it can be scary when 100,000 in an audience are eating it up and shouting Amen.\n More scary when you're probably the only one in the audience who's atheistic and HAS read the bible going ###?!? As I was a decade ago in Indianapolis.\n \n \n Now, for my own speculation based on the Christian Bible, God has no form save through the manifestation of the Christ who is said to have been human.\n God has used angelic servents and events to make his presence known and desires heard.\n \n You could also speculate that God was an E.T. merely seen through the eyes of an ignorant and primitive peoples in ancient times. This has been pushed by New Agers and the like.\n \n \n I've had personal experience with most religions and belief systems. It's a quite fascinating hobby that can often bit the arse harshly.",
