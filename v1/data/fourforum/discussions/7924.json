I am not at all surprised that so many turn out.

This whole thing started with administration's war on terror folly pointing out porous US borders offering easy access to terrorists.\n\n \n As I have said before, I see two problems with this. \n \n First, we have next to no border security. As I have said before, I try to be a realist, not an idealist, so I recognize that not only do we not have any real border security, we never will. We have too much border and too much coastline to actually believe in border security. It is simply not possible given the expense required. Even if we seal up the US/Mexico border, and the US/Canadian border, we still have thousands of miles of unprotected coast lines. As anybody who has ever entered the country on a private yacht knows, they don't even have to be sneaky. There are thousands of little harbors and ports that you can put into and as long as you are flying a US flag, nobody asks any questions.\n \n I do, however, think that the issue of capital flight is worth addressing. I don't think that we can afford a massive guest worker program just based on the amount of money being shipped back to mexico. A much better alternative would be an immigration policy that allows companies to sponser a worker, and allws them and their immediate family, into the country. This woud limit the capital flight.",

Maybe not approving of slavery, but too close.\n \n These protests, like the one in Dallas yesterday, are no accident, not the spontaneous act of civil disobedience it looks like.\n \n Here's a poll that claimes public support for a version of the Senate bill is growing, thanks in part to these demonstrations:\n \n http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002923934_immigcongress11.html\n \n Doubt it.

   "Except most of the protesters are the citizen/resident relations of illegals. The illegals themselves are too busy working to protest or worry about your ingratitude.\n\n \n How much gratitude do you think they deserve? They come to our country illegally, supress wages, don't pay taxes, and soak up our (expensive) government services. If you are an American employee, hatred would be a more appropriate response than gratitude.\n \n On the othr hand, America is in for a drastic adjustment when it comes to stadard of living, and the foreign workers can help facilitate that. I know that if there had been a guest worker program in place when I was running my last company, there would not have been an American tradesman in the place. American machinists make $60-$80,000 per year. Mexican machinists, good one, make $20-$25,000 per year in mexico. I could have imported 50 of them, paid them $35,000 per year, and everybody would have been happy. \n \n If we institute a guest worker program, I may open another business. Americans, with their incredibly inflated salary requirements, need not apply. I think this is going to be GREAT for our country. I can certainly understand blue collar workers fear of this kind of thing, and it is only lack of foresight that keeps white collar workers from rebelling as well because while there is essentially no risk of some uneducated mexican pesant taking your engineering job, I will bet you a million bucks that somewhere in india there is an engineer who would LOVE to be a guest worker and do your job for half what you are making.",

   "I still think this latest refocus by current administration to take the heat off of their Iraq disaster in an election year will end up backfiring on them. At 11-million, illegal Hispanic immigrants are 3.7% of the US population. Offending even one friend or supporter each of all illegal immigrants will swing a lot of elections in states with Hispanic populations exceeding 20%. \n \n If administration doesn't close the borders to the best of their ability, an impossibility, they've offended those voters who erroneously believe illegal immigrants are taking their jobs. Not attempting to close borders will satisfy neocon political money sources at the expense of undermining administration's primary tool of fear, terrorist border access. \n \n Put the latest political gaff, Iran, on top of the immigration issue and it seems administration is just continuing an unending string of bad calls.",

   "You're going to see more of those drunks on check day. As our migration from industrial to service economy deepens, wage and benefit losses at the manufacturing level are already flowing down to the service level in the form of wage stagnation in a time of inflation. A free government ride will become even more appealing. \n \n Immigrants, legal and illegal, generally start working at the bottom of the food chain. I don't have any current numbers, but 10-years ago a working immigrant enabled for social programs contributed about 2/3 of their social costs in taxes, leaving a government liability of 1/3. \n \n Prior to 9/11, a blind eye was turned to illegal immigration, from Mexico and S. America in particular, because there were (and are) jobs immigrants could perform and they wanted those jobs. If they made a legal buck, 14% of it was withheld and transfered from the SS Trust into general funds and they were doing jobs that the typical high school dropout or perpetual student refused as being beneath his or her station in life. We got really fat and lazy, Americans didn't have to take the crummy jobs. \n \n Some tax revenue is better than none. As more businesses paying taxes are better than less. I personally know of several assembly businesses that could not be going concerns were it not for minimum wage laborers, mostly immigrants, who want to work and will work at any paying job. \n \n We know sealing our borders is an impossibility. We know people from other countries are going to immigrate here, legal or illegal, because our lowest standard of living, far below the poverty line, is far superior to their prior experience and potential within their native countries. We know the problem is too massive to enforce by employer compliance. We need a guest worker program to help support those Americans on the free government ride.",
