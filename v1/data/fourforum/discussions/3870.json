   "I am new to this forum so many of these issues may already have been raised in other threads, so please forgive any repetitiveness. I simply felt compelled to start adding my voice to the open internet debates on this subject so as to better understand the rational reasons behind people's points of view.\n \n From my own exploration of the controversial issue of abortion, the most important question which frames the debate seems to be: When does an \"it\" become a \"he\" or a \"she\" within the course of a pregnancy? Or, phrased another way, when does a batch of human cells, which one might call \"human life\" become a \"person\" deserving of rights and protections that all of us have, and how do we define that \"personhood\"? I would agree with pro-Lifers and, I believe, with most people of both camps, that killing a \"person\" is indeed murder, assuming that such killing could or should have been avoided (exceptions in self-defense, war, etc.). However, I disagree with the common pro-Life stance that \"personhood\" begins at conception.\n \n I myself am pro-choice, with limits that closely mirror those imposed by Roe vs. Wade. My own point of view on the beginning of \"personhood\" is the idea of \"I think, therefore I am\". Namely, what makes a mere life into a \"person\" is the start of a human mind that possesses the most rudimentary thoughts and emotions. This seems to occur at the end of the second, beginning of the third trimester of the pregnancy. Therefore, I personally believe that the abortion decision should be left up to the mother in the first and second trimester, and restricted in the third trimester (except for a threat to the life of the mother, etc.). Carl Sagan makes a good argument along these lines in an article in the link: http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml \n \n I do not understand the source of the pro-Life position of \"personhood\" beginning at conception and perhaps those of you who are pro-Life could enlighten me here. If it is based on religious beliefs, then I am confused about what forms the scholarly basis of this belief since the Bible is quite unclear on the topic. My own religious point of view is that God would be very cruel indeed to place a soul in a body that is so underformed, as the human body is in the first and second trimester. \n \n I will agree with various pro-Lifers that the \"potential\" of personhood inherent in the early embryo and fetus should be respected, but I believe that the \"potential\" of personhood should by no means be mistaken for \"personhood\" itself, which is far more important. The rights of a \"potential\" but not yet existing person should not take precedence over the rights of the mother, an obviously existing \"person\". It does, however, require that the decision not be taken lightly and I also am quite disappointed to see some women take the abortion decision lightly. That simply must be left to their consciences.\n \n I am quite curious to hear any thoughtful opinions on either side on this topic.",

   "Too many specifics to put into one poll, methinks. \n \n\n You are probably right. My original idea was to have a two-part poll - one part asking whether the voter was pro-life or pro-choice, and the other part asking at which point the embryo/fetus should gain an unquestioned right to life (conception, end of first trimester, end of second trimester or birth).

Polls that I've looked at only show about 10-15% of Americans believe that abortion should be outlawed in all circumstances, so it looks like the pro-life side has some \"give\" as well.\n \n Overall, I think that most people on both sides place value both on the rights of \"persons\" and on the rights of the mother. The main difference seems to be the relative importance attached to each right, and the concept of when in the pregnancy the embryo/fetus becomes a person whose right to life should outweigh the rights of the mother. \n \n I, for one, can find no rational reason why most, though not all, of the pro-life camp seems to equate conception with the beginning of personhood. Yes, after conception, the fertilized egg is alive - after all, nearly all the cells of our bodies are alive, as are human egg cells and sperm. Yes, the newly fertilized egg is a potential person, but potential personhood is not yet personhood, it is just a higher probability of becoming a person. A human egg cell is also a potential person with a much lower probability of becoming a person. As for actual personhood, I cannot see in what possible way, outside of having human DNA, a newly fertilized egg is anything like a generally accepted idea of a person, with at least some sub-conscious or conscious thoughts and emotions.

How is it a person?\n\n \n I have no beef with your points here--obviously a fertilized egg is not a \"person\" in the sense of conciousness with thoughts and emotions. The problem is that one could describe a newborn baby the same way, or perhaps a person in a deep coma. That is why most pro-choicers prefer to argue their view from the standpoint that the baby is 'attached' and dependent on the mother, thinking somehow that gives the mother full moral authority to kill it. The issue of 'personhood' is tenuous for both sides, really. On one hand it is hard to say that personhood begins at conception, but at least that is a notable moment. If we base personhood on conciousness, we have other problems (adults are sometimes unconcious and not thinking, such as in a coma), and the point of life viability is changing with technology for babies as well.\n \n For me, wanting to see abortion slowed or ended in the world isn't so much about the question of when life begins, but rather the value and respect for life.

I would ask either you or him to provide a link to any pro-life organization that isn't a fringe group that would advocate unrestricted early abortions. However, his beliefs align closely to the Roe v Wade decision of the Supreme Court, which is pretty much universally agreed as a landmark pro-choice victory. \n \n Also, look at what the terms \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice\" generally mean. \"Pro-life\" is the belief that the life of the fetus is more important than the woman's right to choose for her body. \"Pro-choice\" is the opposite, that the woman's right to choose for her body is more important than any life the fetus possesses.

What is a \"person\" to you? Legal \"personhood\" does not depend on conciousness.\n \n \n\n The problem is that one could describe a newborn baby the same way, or perhaps a person in a deep coma.\n\n \n Is it as \"obvious\" here? If it is as \"obvious\", why are newborn babies and coma patients considered people?\n \n \n\n That is why most pro-choicers prefer to argue their view from the standpoint that the baby is 'attached' and dependent on the mother, thinking somehow that gives the mother full moral authority to kill it.\n\n \n Why does the mother have full moral authority to kill it to you, then, if not this? How do you differ from \"most pro-choicers\"\n \n \n\n The issue of 'personhood' is tenuous for both sides, really.\n\n \n No, not really. It is a legal construct. It applies at birth. How is that tenuous?\n \n \n\n On one hand it is hard to say that personhood begins at conception, but at least that is a notable moment.\n\n \n Again, not really. There is no way for a woman to know when she concieves (beyond folk tales and such.

It is a much more logically sound point, because there is little question when it occurs.\n \n \n\n If we base personhood on conciousness, we have other problems (adults are sometimes unconcious and not thinking, such as in a coma), and the point of life viability is changing with technology for babies as well.\n\n \n That is part of the reason why birth is a much more logically sound point to anchor \"personhood\" to.\n \n \n\n For me, wanting to see abortion slowed or ended in the world isn't so much about the question of when life begins, but rather the value and respect for life. Even the potential life (which WILL mostly likely take place) is enough for that, in my mind.\n\n \n Then you do not respect life early in the pregnancy?

No, I would not feel the same. With one, it is justifiable because there is no other choice besides killing it.

   "With the poll you're quoting, you didn't show how many would want it illegal in most circumstances. An exception for the life of the mother is present among reasonable people, as well as rape and incest :P However, that seems to be the only concession available to the pro-life side. Once you start allowing abortions in more and more instances, your policy beliefs are really pro-choice.\n\n \n There is a nice link which summarizes a lot of polls taken on abortion issues within the last decade: http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm\n \n In most of the polls, you are right that, among people who are not clearly pro-choice, the only exceptions that most people give are for the life of the mother, rape and incest. However, the wording and limited options in most of these polls skew these numbers. What interests me most are the polls taken by the Associated Press about Roe vs. Wade. Though the poll question may be somewhat misleading in defining Roe as allowing abortion only in the first trimester, the results seem to consistently show roughly 60% in support and 30% against Roe vs. Wade, as it is defined in the poll. That shows that Americans support the right to an abortion in the first trimester in a nearly two to one ratio. A non-insignificant amount of that 60% overflows into the pro-life camp. The CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll of Jan. 10-12, 2003 is more direct in its question and shows that 66% of Americans support keeping abortion legal in the first trimester (vs. 29% against). That is certainly not all pro-choice people and it gives me hope that many in the pro-life camp do not advocate the extreme position either.\n \n However, I can certainly see your concern about the fact that all or nearly all pro-life organizations advocate restriction of abortion from conception, with exceptions only for the life of the mother, rape or incest. From a purely organizational point of view, this can then define the organizational or legal efforts of people in the pro-life camp as being limited to the more extreme positions. However, I can see how people can label themselves as pro-life, despite having more moderate views that are not represented by pro-life organizations. This leads me to the question for those that are more \"moderately\" pro-life, why do you not have any organizations that reflect your point of view?\n \n I suppose that part of self-identification comes to a choice of which \"image\" one is willing to attach to oneself and the circle of friends and acquaintances that define such an image. To many in more liberal to moderate-liberal states, pro-life people seem to show no compassion to pregnant women and zealously insist on forcing women to carry a pregnancy against their will based on often irrational reasons. To many in more conservative to moderate-conservative states, pro-choice people may seem to show no compassion to the fetus and are thus killing, in their minds, a helpless loveable unborn baby. I suspect that people in the pro-life camp almost always imagine a fetus as a late-term fetus, not the newly fertilized egg, for which it would be much harder for them to feel as much empathy.",

That is why most pro-choicers prefer to argue their view from the standpoint that the baby is 'attached' and dependent on the mother, thinking somehow that gives the mother full moral authority to kill it.

If we base personhood on conciousness, we have other problems (adults are sometimes unconcious and not thinking, such as in a coma), and the point of life viability is changing with technology for babies as well.\n\n \n As I mentioned in a previous message, just because thoughts or emotions may not be conscious does not mean that they do not exist. When we are asleep, our thoughts and emotions are sub-conscious or semi-conscious. These types of sub-conscious thoughts or emotions can be quite elaborate and certainly do exist. In my own definition of personhood, I do not require the thoughts or emotions to be conscious or even elaborate in any way. I suppose that, in my definition of personhood, I simply require the most basic sense of human mind, even be it merely a sub-conscious sense of self. If the brain is only developed enough to be a controller of the most basic functioning of the body (heart, lungs, etc.) and nothing more, then I would say that there is no person there.

   "That wasn't the question. The question was why is \"I respect life\" purely a pro-life thing to say?\n\n \n Because the pro-life position favors the life of the baby. The life of the baby doesn't seem to be a priority of the pro-choice position.\n \n \nOk. How would you wish to do that? Do you share the goals of the pro-life crowd and make abortion illegal?\n\n \n The goal of the pro-life crowd is the stop abortion. The legal issue is a means to an end to them.\n \n \nDo you wish to support women so that they don't feel that abortion is their best choice, but remain a choice? That would be more along the lines of the pro-choice crowd.\n\n \n I think there needs to be an approach that does both: support women AND work toward making abortion illegal in most cases. The reason that \"unsafe\" abortion were a problem before Roe v. Wade was that women were not getting the support they needed to carry, birth, and raise their babies. Or, in cases where they didn't want them, put them up for adoption. Those things need to always favor the needs of women. I believe that if our culture a.) relearns the joy and value in having children, and b.) give full support and help to expecting mothers, abortion could be a blight of history that we need not return to. At least it could be a case where it is very rare.\n \n \nHow do you intend to do that? In order to not take choice away, you have to allow them to make the choice. \n\n \n The focus doesn't need to be the legal issue--it needs to be education. Right now, the pro-life movement works in two directions: the legal issue, and the education issue. The education issue works toward helping people see that a culture which values life and wants to keep their expectant babies is a better way. I think that pro-life movement needs to work more in the area of changing public sentiment about pregnancy and having babies to a more positive thing, rather than just the legal end (which is really a means to an end, anyway).\n \n \nHow is abortion morally the same as killing a newborn? If a woman does not want a newborn it can be left with friends, relatives, a hospital, an orphanage, etc. If a woman does not want a fetus inside her abortion is her only option.\n\n \n Ok, I'll give you that. But pregnancy is only 9 months--surely you can agree that if she could just wait a bit, the abortion could be avoided and both mother AND baby could live on, albeit separately if need be. Unless the mother is in danger in some way, how could that not be a better option?\n \n \nWith one, the fetus is living off of her organs and life-processes and cannot be put down, cannot be left, is constantly a drain on her body. A newborn is not. \n\n \n Hmm . . . tell that to a mother who is staying up much of the night with her newborn. I'd say that's quite a drain on her body.\n \n \nThey aren't illegal because they are immoral, where did you get that idea? They're illegal regardless of their morality.\n\n \n I think you misunderstood. What I mean is that moral issues lead to laws. This is common. We consider it immoral to beat a pet; no person is harmed and animals aren't covered under the constitution, yet we have animal cruelty laws--it's because we have an understanding in our culture that beating a pet is a bad (immoral) thing to do. In a similar light, abortion is much more of a cultural problem than a legal one.\n \n \nOh? Based on harm, and not morality? What of the harm to the woman? Surely that is not inconsequencial.\n\n \n That is why many pro-lifers, including myself, allow for abortions in cases where the woman's life is threatened.\n \n \nyou want to do regarding abortion. Are you against abortion because you believe it is morally equivalent to killing a newborn?\n\n \n Yes.\n \n \nAre you against all abortion because of that, or just some? If not, why are you against it earlier?\n\n \n If the mother is in danger, I am not against it, but only because it is the best of a very hard difficult problem--it literally becomes a case where it is mother versus baby at that point, and the mother should take precedence of course. But if the mother is not in danger, it doesn't have to be an either/or scenario. And so it shouldn't--that way NO one is killed or harmed.",

   "There is a nice link which summarizes a lot of polls taken on abortion issues within the last decade: http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm\n\n \n Coincidently enough, I was looking at that very same page when I was replying to you before :p\n \n \n\n In most of the polls, you are right that, among people who are not clearly pro-choice, the only exceptions that most people give are for the life of the mother, rape and incest. However, the wording and limited options in most of these polls skew these numbers. What interests me most are the polls taken by the Associated Press about Roe vs. Wade. Though the poll question may be somewhat misleading in defining Roe as allowing abortion only in the first trimester, the results seem to consistently show roughly 60% in support and 30% against Roe vs. Wade, as it is defined in the poll. That shows that Americans support the right to an abortion in the first trimester in a nearly two to one ratio. A non-insignificant amount of that 60% overflows into the pro-life camp. The CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll of Jan. 10-12, 2003 is more direct in its question and shows that 66% of Americans support keeping abortion legal in the first trimester (vs. 29% against). That is certainly not all pro-choice people and it gives me hope that many in the pro-life camp do not advocate the extreme position either.\n\n \n However, if someone who is \"pro-life\" supports Roe v Wade, then they are pro-choice. That's really the sticker. To be pro-life, in terms of policy, is to advocate the life of what is inside the woman over the woman's right to terminate that life. If you advocate woman's rights at any point in the pregnancy, it is a pro-choice position. The pro-life position has very little to it. Any compromise on the part of pro-life people undermines their entire position, the only consistant pro-life position is \"protection from conception on\", with life and rape exceptions. Anything else and they're being wishy washy. \n \n \n\n However, I can certainly see your concern about the fact that all or nearly all pro-life organizations advocate restriction of abortion from conception, with exceptions only for the life of the mother, rape or incest. From a purely organizational point of view, this can then define the organizational or legal efforts of people in the pro-life camp as being limited to the more extreme positions. However, I can see how people can label themselves as pro-life, despite having more moderate views that are not represented by pro-life organizations. This leads me to the question for those that are more \"moderately\" pro-life, why do you not have any organizations that reflect your point of view?\n\n \n Well, like I said above, the only consistant position on the pro-life side is from conception onward. There simply is no other logical point after that to anchor \"protection from this point onward\" to, besides birth. Viability changes, there is controversy over sentience and no way to measure it reliably. Any other point is arbitrary and opens it up to \"well why not one day more or less? And one more day or one less day after that?\".\n \n My problem with conception being what is constitutionaly protected is that it is not known in the vast majority of cases. If it is constitutionaly protected then it must be a citizen, right? What do we do with women who \"harm\" their pregnancy before they know they are pregnant, and how do we measure that \"harm\"? What of the 1/3 of all pregnancies that end in miscarriage, will they be investigated? What sort of punishment is levied for the women who harm their own pregnancies, and who determines what that harm is? There are lists a mile long of things that can harm a pregnancy, from changing the litter box to exercising to standing up for too long to sitting for too long, etc. Once you start legislating the fetus' life to be more important than the woman's rights, where do you stop?\n \n \n\n I suppose that part of self-identification comes to a choice of which \"image\" one is willing to attach to oneself and the circle of friends and acquaintances that define such an image. To many in more liberal to moderate-liberal states, pro-life people seem to show no compassion to pregnant women and zealously insist on forcing women to carry a pregnancy against their will based on often irrational reasons. To many in more conservative to moderate-conservative states, pro-choice people may seem to show no compassion to the fetus and are thus killing, in their minds, a helpless loveable unborn baby. I suspect that people in the pro-life camp almost always imagine a fetus as a late-term fetus, not the newly fertilized egg, for which it would be much harder for them to feel as much empathy.\n\n \n You are probably right here. The image is important, and I am sure that pro-life people imagine perfect little white babies being slaughtered in abortion.",

   "Because the pro-life position favors the life of the baby. The life of the baby doesn't seem to be a priority of the pro-choice position.\n\n \n The fetus does not have to be more important than the woman to respect life.\n \n \n\n The goal of the pro-life crowd is the stop abortion. The legal issue is a means to an end to them.\n\n \n Does that end justify violating rights?\n \n \n\n I think there needs to be an approach that does both: support women AND work toward making abortion illegal in most cases.\n\n \n I have no objection to the first, in fact I contribute myself. The second violates women's rights, and that should not be done.\n \n \n\n The reason that \"unsafe\" abortion were a problem before Roe v. Wade was that women were not getting the support they needed to carry, birth, and raise their babies.\n\n \n The reason unsafe abortions were and are a problem was that they were unsafe and unsanitary, and killed women. I'm not sure how you reached your conclusion.\n \n \n\n Or, in cases where they didn't want them, put them up for adoption. Those things need to always favor the needs of women. I believe that if our culture a.) relearns the joy and value in having children, and b.) give full support and help to expecting mothers, abortion could be a blight of history that we need not return to. At least it could be a case where it is very rare.\n\n \n I notice \"making it illegal\" was not included in your list. Is that what you intended?\n \n \n\n The focus doesn't need to be the legal issue--it needs to be education.\n\n \n If pro-life people weren't focussed on making it illegal, education could become the focus. I would agree that education is important in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n \n \n\n Right now, the pro-life movement works in two directions: the legal issue, and the education issue. The education issue works toward helping people see that a culture which values life and wants to keep their expectant babies is a better way. I think that pro-life movement needs to work more in the area of changing public sentiment about pregnancy and having babies to a more positive thing, rather than just the legal end (which is really a means to an end, anyway).\n\n \n And the end does not justify the means.

But pregnancy is only 9 months\n\n \n It is not ok to violate people's rights, even if it is for \"a little while\".\n \n \n\n --surely you can agree that if she could just wait a bit, the abortion could be avoided and both mother AND baby could live on, albeit separately if need be.\n\n \n That's fine. She should not be forced too. If she recieved support, monetarily or otherwise, maybe she could. Not all women recieve that support. Requiring it is immoral and shows no compassion for individual circumstances.\n \n \n\n Unless the mother is in danger in some way, how could that not be a better option?\n\n \n Danger in what way? Just her life? What about her health? Not just physical health, but her mental and emotional health are important too. Without the financial support, all of those can suffer, too.\n \n \n\n Hmm . . . tell that to a mother who is staying up much of the night with her newborn. I'd say that's quite a drain on her body.\n\n \n A drain she can put up for adoption, or give to the grandparents for the day to \"get away\". You cannot do that with a fetus. You are carrying and being drained 24/7. Usually, ideally, this would be welcomed. It should not be forced, in any case.\n \n \n\n I think you misunderstood. What I mean is that moral issues lead to laws.\n\n \n Again, I do not think so. There are reasons behind morals. Those reasons lead to the morals, and those reasons lead to the laws too. They aren't laws because they were morals. Sometimes there are no reasons for certain morals. Morals are separate from laws.\n \n \n\n This is common. We consider it immoral to beat a pet; no person is harmed and animals aren't covered under the constitution, yet we have animal cruelty laws--it's because we have an understanding in our culture that beating a pet is a bad (immoral) thing to do.\n\n \n This is true. Animal cruelty laws are a bit of an anomaly, mostly due to the fact that our society tends to anthropomorphize cute little cuddly animals. There are books written on the subject, one interesting one about bestiality in societies and how twisted our view of our animals is becoming. Sorta creepy too :p\n \n However, if my dog got too old for my tastes, I can take it to the vet and have it killed.\n \n \n\n In a similar light, abortion is much more of a cultural problem than a legal one.\n\n \n Do you think it can really be solved with making it illegal?\n \n \n\n That is why many pro-lifers, including myself, allow for abortions in cases where the woman's life is threatened.\n\n \n There is more to \"harm\" than just life threatening.\n \n \n\n If the mother is in danger, I am not against it, but only because it is the best of a very hard difficult problem--it literally becomes a case where it is mother versus baby at that point, and the mother should take precedence of course. But if the mother is not in danger, it doesn't have to be an either/or scenario.\n\n \n If the woman does not want it, it is an either/or scenario. If she does not want it, you either support the woman's rights, or you support the fetus' life.\n \n The woman takes precedence in all situations.\n \n \n\n And so it shouldn't--that way NO one is killed or harmed.\n\n \n That's all well and good, but the woman should always have the right to kill something living off her life-processes as a fetus does. Otherwise her rights are inferior to what she is carrying.",

In other words, if we can analyze our moral reasons against murder in general, then we might be closer to knowing for ourselves when to view the killing of a pre-born fetus as murder.\n \n There are many reasons why I personally consider murder bad. The main one is the sense of empathy for the victim. I can empathize with the suffering, the fear, the sense of loss and everything that the victim is going through. There are other more complicated reasons that are more inclusive, but all of my reasons assume that the victim is a person, in the sense that they have a human mind, no matter how simple. I just don't see how a newly fertilized egg is a person in this sense. It is not mincing words - this is a very critical point. A life and a person are not the same thing, at least not to me.

In late stages of pregnancy, a fetus has gained the human quality of having at least the beginnings of a human mind.

However, in practise, pro-life people tend to be religious and believe there is no compromise about when a human life deserves protection, while pro-choice people tend to go with unrestricted access in the first 2 trimesters. If there is any flexibility in the pro-life position, that person most likely is not religious and most likely will not stick to some arbitrary point. So, while in theory there is a vast amount of middle ground for compromise, the nature of the beast creates a pretty clear delineation of positions.\n \n \n\n Indeed, if we define pro-life as insisting on the dominance of the rights of the fetus over that of the mother, and pro-choice as the other way around, then polls seem to show that the significant majority of people, myself included, are pro-choice at early stages of the pregnancy and pro-life at late stages, no matter how strange that may sound.\n\n \n Not strange at all.

I would think that it is polls which give them their best information about the substance of people's beliefs.\n\n \n I have no doubt that they watch polls closely to decide what will get them re-elected. Bush threw the Christian Right a bone with his anti-abortion stance to get himself a boost. It's not so much the people, though, as the special interest groups.

That's the frustration with dealing with a postion that is primarily motivated by religion, there is little to no compromise with religious dogma.\n \n Though there have been some who have attempted to argue the pro-life position without religion, it always seems to come down to personal morals. It's not really a logical position, but an emotional and self-centered (in terms of believing one's personal morals should be made into law) one. With no objective moral code to hold up, I have seen no logical argument.

   "Surely ;) Sites with polls or merely information sites related to abortion? \n If you know of any sites that were particularly inspiring, I would be interested in taking a look. :) I would be particularly curious about any polls specifying in which trimesters people believe abortion should be outlawed. Also, if you know, or anyone reading this knows, of a site which tries to give a logical, non-faith-based, description of the reasons behind the pro-life position, I would be quite interested to read it in order to better understand the basis of the pro-life view.\n \n \n \nI have no doubt that they watch polls closely to decide what will get them re-elected. Bush threw the Christian Right a bone with his anti-abortion stance to get himself a boost. It's not so much the people, though, as the special interest groups. Whether or not the majority of the country wants a thing (and according to the polls the majority want abortion legal), politicians cater to those who have political clout and money. \n\n I suspect that, for politicians, it is a balance of a number of factors. Yes, those with political clout and money do exert some influence - the more money, the more influence. I'm not sure how much money the pro-life lobby donates, but I never had the impression that it was anything close to that of, say, the insurance or pharmaceutical industries, whose money carries quite a bit of influence. A second main factor for politicians is supporting the strong beliefs of their constituency. Pro-life positions may be a minority in America, but they constitute a majority of the constituency of the Republican Party - thus Bush's stance on abortion. However, there is yet another major factor. Namely, no candidate for president or for most national offices can afford to alienate the centrists, who form a large swing vote in most elections. Therefore, those candidates who support a minority opinion, can only push the minority agenda insomuch as it does not scare away the centrists (thus losing future elections). They need to take things step by step, and may well never be able to reach their ultimate goal. This includes the abortion issue.\n \n \nUnfortunately, there is no compromise with the pro-life position :-\\ Any site or organization I've seen advocates legal protection at conception; nothing else is \"morally allowable\" with them. That's the frustration with dealing with a position that is primarily motivated by religion, there is little to no compromise with religious dogma. \n \n \n Though there have been some who have attempted to argue the pro-life position without religion, it always seems to come down to personal morals. It's not really a logical position, but an emotional and self-centered (in terms of believing one's personal morals should be made into law) one. With no objective moral code to hold up, I have seen no logical argument. Joyshu, for example, does not provide an argument, only assertions, and stops posting when pushed until he can reply to someone else, or about something else.\n\n Yes, I might agree that most pro-life people are religious, but that does not mean that reason does not form at least part of their thinking, at least not for most religious people. For those whose minds are not moveable by any arguments of reason, I suspect that, apart from the immovability of the blind faith of many of them, the belligerence of the abortion debate contributes to the entrenchment of many in their more extreme beliefs. That is why I so fervently, and probably naively, hope that we can tone down the heat of the debate in order to let people feel free to compromise without loss-of-face. This forum seemed less belligerent than others I have skimmed through, which is why I joined it.",

   "A question to pro-life people who would outlaw abortion from conception on: \n \n \n For those of you who are pro-life and believe that abortion should be outlawed from conception on, what qualities of the first trimester  embryo/fetus do you find so important as to deny a woman a right to her own body? I can understand the empathy for a third-trimester fetus - I have it too and personally believe that abortion should be outlawed in the third trimester in almost all cases. However, I never understood the pro-life position with regards to first trimester abortions.\n \n Do you believe that the embryo/fetus is a person from conception? If so, then how do you define \"person\" and how is it a person? Do you differentiate between the term \"life\" and \"person\"?\n \n Do you believe the embryo/fetus is a potential person and that a potential person's right to life should outweigh the right of the mother? If so, then I suppose that is a basic judgement call that may constitute one of the major differences between the pro-choice and pro-life positions.\n \n When some of you say that all life should be protected, what do you mean?

The right to kill a person (or someone that will soon be a person), even if it's just out of convenience is a horrible thing. The pro-abortion folks have elevated this idea of 'having the right' over any value-judgements of what the right is even for. Empowerment in and of itself is bad if 'empowerment' itself is the end by which we strive for, with no judgement over what we are being empowered to do. This is the same point that the poster Maximus is making to you in another thread, BTW. The act that the 'right' empowers needs to be considered as well--in this case it is an act of killing. To me, abortion is an ethical issue, not just a rights issue. To you, women having this awesome and wonderful \"right\" is a great thing. To me, seeing anyone with the right to kill someone at will and stop their life from moving forward is a terrible thing. This is not rocket science.\n \n \nAny time the questions get too probing, you stop posting.\n \n \n Like I said, it's only because there comes a point when there's no point in continuing--you've made it clear you are only interested in entertaining one point of view.\n \n If you want people to form arguments so you can try and deal with them, the best way to facilitate that sort of thing is to construct arguments yourself, which you haven't done much of.

But doing something immoral (forcing women to be pregnant and give birth against their will) to try and correct something else that is immoral (killing the fetus) is the wrong thing to do, and an immoral thing to do. Two wrongs do not make a right. The bad law would be one banning abortion, one that I cannot morally support. \n \n \n\n I have been.

The right to kill a person (or someone that will soon be a person), even if it's just out of convenience is a horrible thing. The pro-abortion folks have elevated this idea of 'having the right' over any value-judgements of what the right is even for. Empowerment in and of itself is bad if 'empowerment' itself is the end by which we strive for, with no judgement over what we are being empowered to do. This is the same point that the poster Maximus is making to you in another thread, BTW. The act that the 'right' empowers needs to be considered as well--in this case it is an act of killing. To me, abortion is an ethical issue, not just a rights issue. To you, women having this awesome and wonderful \"right\" is a great thing. To me, seeing anyone with the right to kill someone at will and stop their life from moving forward is a terrible thing. This is not rocket science.\n\n \n It is an ethical issue to me to. It is immoral to violate woman's rights, and it is immoral for force women to be pregnant and give birth. Yes, the fetus is a life, yes life should be protected and all that. But your paragraph here neglects to mention the fact that the life of the fetus is attached to and is using the body of another creature. That other creature, the woman, needs to be considered above what is growing inside her. In every way, shape and form. To do otherwise is perverting the respect for life you say you have.\n \n The 'point' that maximus raises is idiotic. Everyone knows that the empowerment is for. How many ways do you want me to state it?\n \n This is where the lack of empathy for women comes in. For you, the circumstances that the women are in simply don't matter to the all-important life of the fetus. Like Jitobear has said to you, there is no fetus without the woman. The condition and circumstance of the woman needs to come first before any consideration of the fetus, life or no. Women having this right is not only a \"great thing\" but an essential thing in a free society. Individual rights are paramount in our society, or should be in a free society.\n \n \n\n Like I said, it's only because there comes a point when there's no point in continuing--you've made it clear you are only interested in entertaining one point of view.\n\n \n In a sense. I am utterly convinced of my viewpoint, but I certainly would acknowledge the validity of your view if I felt it had any. You believe that it is more immoral to kill the fetus, while I feel it is more immoral to force women to be pregnant and give birth. I guess we'll have to leave it at that.\n \n \n\n If you want people to form arguments so you can try and deal with them, the best way to facilitate that sort of thing is to construct arguments yourself, which you haven't done much of. You don't get to control the forum--construct your own compelling arguments rather than telling others to do it.\n\n \n I wasn't aware you didn't know my reasons and my support for those reasons. What aspect of my argument are you unclear on?\n \n I control nothing. If I feel that you have given inadequate support or have a non-existant argument I will say so. I have no way to enforce any strictures, nor do I attempted to make any. You can ignore my posts, or you can respond to them. I will probably make snide comments if you ignore them, but you are free to ignore those as well.",

   "Is it more morally wrong to destroy a life in this instance (or, say, early in the pregnancy), or more wrong to force a woman to remain pregnant and give birth against her will? Do you even think it is morally wrong to force women to be pregnant and give birth against their will?\n\n \n I think the greatest 'wrong' that is really done in the situation is by the mother not having the will to keep the child. You probably won't like that, but it's my opinion. In a sense, regarding the issue of abortion, the govt.'s role is perhipheral. Ultimately the best thing is for women to realize that choosing life is the better way.\n \n \nYour claim that it is wrong because it is a life requires support. Is killing morally allowable in certain circumstances, and why is it that it is not in this certain circumstance? What criteria is there?\n\n \n This is going to get get into exceptions. I do think the life of the mother is an exception (and I've already said this) because in that case it literally comes down to a situation where it is the mother or the baby. It has to be an either/or scenario. But most of the time otherwise, it does not.\n \n \nAnd what exactly is 'harm' in this instance? Harm to whom? Society? Women? Men? The fetus? \n\n \n Definitely the fetus, and I would also say to women as well, to some degree based on some things I have read.\n \n \nHow do you intend to \"see abortion stopped\"? \n\n \n One strategy is through education--showing how choosing to keep the baby is a viable and better way.\n \n The other is indeed through changing the law, but this will have to accompanied by the first strategy, lest we start getting a lot of home unsafe abortions. We certainly don't want that, for the mothers' sakes and for the fetus.\n \n \nI want to save lives too.\n\n \n But how can you say that and at the same time support a law that allows killing those same lives? Do you not see how this is a contradiction?\n \n \nBut doing something immoral (forcing women to be pregnant and give birth against their will) \n\n \n Ultimately, I think the greater wrong here is in the killing of a fetus. But that is obviously going to be a philosophical difference between you and I.\n \n \nHow exactly have I wanted to define and control the discussion? I told you we can talk about whatever you want to talk about.\n\n \n Ok, sorry for the wrong accusation.\n \n \nWhat do you use as justification to have the life of the fetus' be more important than her rights?\n\n \n My justifications are\n \n - the loss for the fetus is greater--in successful pregnancy the woman loses 9 months of her life to discomfort, stress, and possible emotional issues, but in abortion the fetus loses its entire life ahead of it.\n \n - Rights should only be allowed if they do not infringe upon the rights of another. In my opinion, abortion infringes upon the rights of a life that is, and at the least, will be as a person. Some would say it already is a person and that the fact it will soon grow into a toddler, adolescent, etc, is reason enough. I tend to feel that way too.\n \n \nWhat harm does it cause and to whom? \n\n \n To the fetus, of course.\n \n \nHow can you even conceptualize forcing women to stay pregnant against their will? That's ... fiendishly evil.\n\n \n But because the law allows for abortion, this comes down to what is the worst of two fiendish evils: a woman having to stay pregnant versus the fetus killed and it's entire life's future taken away. To me, killing the fetus is the worst of the two.\n \n \nIt is immoral to violate woman's rights, \n\n \n But what of rights that are malevolent and deadly? Why should that be a right?\n \n \nBut your paragraph here neglects to mention the fact that the life of the fetus is attached to and is using the body of another creature. That other creature, the woman, needs to be considered above what is growing inside her. \n\n \n But here's the bottom line IMO: it doesn't have to be an either/or situation. I agree that the woman should be respected and and considered, but at the expense of an entire lifetime wiped out? The problem I have with your position is that it doesn't really take that lifetime of the son or daughter into account. \n \n You seem to have a mindset (based on the way you are portraying this with statements like \"women being forced\") that this is a situation of society versus the woman, but I don't think so. I think that is a wrong perception (albeit perpetrated by lack of support towards women in the past) that could be done away with. I think that pregnancy needs to be looked at (in the eyes of society AND the woman) as a wonderful thing rather than the either/or scenario. The woman does need to keep her baby, at leat until it is born. There's no way around that--its just not fair to kill it. But society needs to support that woman, 100%--no exceptions. She shouldn't be put in a predicament where she can't financially afford the pregnancy, or where she can't get good medical care during and after the pregnancy, or placed in a predicament where she can't afford to keep the baby if she wants, among many other issues. I definitely agree with you that the woman needs to be supported--I just can't agree that killing the baby should be a right (under anything but the usual exception).\n \n \nI wasn't aware you didn't know my reasons and my support for those reasons. What aspect of my argument are you unclear on?\n\n \n On what basis should the mother have the right to take away the entire future and future lifetime for the fetus?\n \n On what basis do you feel a right should be given if it is a malevolent right to kill?

In a sense, regarding the issue of abortion, the govt.'s role is perhipheral. Ultimately the best thing is for women to realize that choosing life is the better way.\n\n \n I agree that women should realize that choosing life is a wonderful thing. I do not agree that that choice should be forced by law. Then it is no choice at all.\n \n \n\n This is going to get get into exceptions. I do think the life of the mother is an exception (and I've already said this) because in that case it literally comes down to a situation where it is the mother or the baby. It has to be an either/or scenario. But most of the time otherwise, it does not.\n\n \n I was thinking along the lines of other instances where life is being taken away, such as war and when your house is broken into etc (not meant to be an analogy, simply an example). The value of life changes depending on the circumstances one is in, yet this is not consistant with your \"it's a life so it shouldn't be killed\" argument\n \n \n\n Definitely the fetus, and I would also say to women as well, to some degree based on some things I have read.\n\n \n Why is the harm to the fetus more important than the harm to the woman? Is it only the degree of harm? How do you measure the harm to the fetus, given that it has no nerves or conciousness early in the pregnancy? Why does the nebulous 'harm' of the loss of potential life have more weight with you than the very real harm of forcing women to remain pregnant against their will?\n \n \n\n One strategy is through education--showing how choosing to keep the baby is a viable and better way.\n \n The other is indeed through changing the law, but this will have to accompanied by the first strategy, lest we start getting a lot of home unsafe abortions. We certainly don't want that, for the mothers' sakes and for the fetus.\n\n \n I agree that education should be increased, as well as support for women. However, why must it be made illegal? You have said before that you do not care if the law is in place as long as women aren't having abortions, and I am fine with that. If there is education and support, I firmly believe the number of abortions will go down, but by no means will eliminate the desire for them entirely. There are too many situations where abortion truly seems the best choice for a woman in desperate situations, and imo there is no way to eliminate desperate situations because desperate situations are in many ways subjective. And in no situation should the gov't force a woman to remain pregnant when she does not wish to be.\n \n \n\n But how can you say that and at the same time support a law that allows killing those same lives? Do you not see how this is a contradiction?\n\n \n In a sense. I see it as there are exceptions, much like your view has exceptions. The right to life is not superior to other's rights. Your right to live is not superior to my right to bodily integrity. The fetus' right to life (which it does not have) is not superior to a woman's right to bodily integrity. My rights end where yours begin and the fetus' (nonexistant rights) end where the woman's begin.\n \n \n\n Ultimately, I think the greater wrong here is in the killing of a fetus. But that is obviously going to be a philosophical difference between you and I.\n\n \n Very much so. As a patriot once said:\n \n \"Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\"\n \n There is nothing more important than freedom from oppression. \n \n \n\n My justifications are\n \n - the loss for the fetus is greater--in successful pregnancy the woman loses 9 months of her life to discomfort, stress, and possible emotional issues, but in abortion the fetus loses its entire life ahead of it.\n\n \n Violating rights for 9 months, or 1 month or 1 week does not make it right. Not even to ensure the survival of someone else.\n \n Speaking purely in the moral sense, I may be morally reprehensible to not donate blood if there was suddenly an emergency and I was right there to save someone, but I have the right to not be forced to donate blood. That is what our country was founded on.\n \n \n\n - Rights should only be allowed if they do not infringe upon the rights of another. In my opinion, abortion infringes upon the rights of a life that is, and at the least, will be as a person. Some would say it already is a person and that the fact it will soon grow into a toddler, adolescent, etc, is reason enough. I tend to feel that way too.\n\n \n I agree! However, turn it around and the fetus does not have the right to live off another's body without their desire or consent. The fetus' right to the woman's body is never ever ever greater than the woman's right to her body. I do not have that right, you do not have that right, the fetus does not have that right. If you wish to bestow the benefits of rights, the limitations come along with it. Whatever it will potentially be does not change that fact.\n \n \n\n But because the law allows for abortion, this comes down to what is the worst of two fiendish evils: a woman having to stay pregnant versus the fetus killed and it's entire life's future taken away. To me, killing the fetus is the worst of the two.\n\n \n Again, there is that philosophical difference. Purely in the moral sense I might agree with you, but the gov't should never be able to violate rights, even to ensure another's survival. The worse evil of any situation is the gov't having the power to require women to continue their pregnancies agianst their will.\n \n \n\n But what of rights that are malevolent and deadly? Why should that be a right?\n\n \n That is entirely opinion. I, and I daresay the majority of America, do not view that right as malevolent or deadly. I realize that does not make the majority of America right, but nor does you being in the minority make you right.\n \n Regardless of what you view the right as, that right is part of being in a free society.\n \n \n\n But here's the bottom line IMO: it doesn't have to be an either/or situation. I agree that the woman should be respected and and considered, but at the expense of an entire lifetime wiped out? The problem I have with your position is that it doesn't really take that lifetime of the son or daughter into account.\n\n \n It does, but as you believe that is more important than women's rights, I view our right to our own bodies as vastly superior to other's rights to live. My right to live is not superior to your right to your body. Morally you might be reprehensible for not giving me your kidney if I needed it right now and you were the only one around, but it is and should continue to be your right to refuse. Whatever you decide is between you and your God.\n \n \n\n You seem to have a mindset (based on the way you are portraying this with statements like \"women being forced\") that this is a situation of society versus the woman, but I don't think so.\n\n \n It is if a woman is forced to against her will. If she is doing it because she chooses to then there is no forcing. If she does not want to pierce her ears but is being forced to by law, then society is indeed against her.\n \n \n\n I think that is a wrong perception (albeit perpetrated by lack of support towards women in the past) that could be done away with. I think that pregnancy needs to be looked at (in the eyes of society AND the woman) as a wonderful thing rather than the either/or scenario.\n\n \n Changing the perception is fine and dandy and I certainly support that. \n \n \n\n The woman does need to keep her baby, at leat until it is born. There's no way around that--its just not fair to kill it. But society needs to support that woman, 100%--no exceptions.\n\n \n Nor is it fair to make abortions illegal. Women do not get that 100% support. Even if they did, there are situations where having a child is not something a woman wants to do, for various reasons. Mental, emotional and physical health are important considerations. I'm not saying her life is at risk, but her health. I do not see that mandating by law that a woman continues a pregnancy at the risk of her mental, emotional or physical health is moral.\n \n \n\n She shouldn't be put in a predicament where she can't financially afford the pregnancy, or where she can't get good medical care during and after the pregnancy, or placed in a predicament where she can't afford to keep the baby if she wants, among many other issues. I definitely agree with you that the woman needs to be supported--I just can't agree that killing the baby should be a right (under anything but the usual exception).\n\n \n Her mental, emotional and physical health should be considered as well. These things are subjective in many ways, each woman is in a different situation and have different abilities regarding stress. It should not be up to the law to decide these things.\n \n Education and support will reduce the number of abortions, I am completely convinced of that. However, I do not believe it is possible to totally eliminate them. And in no case do I believe it is correct to force women to remain pregnant against their will.\n \n \n\n On what basis should the mother have the right to take away the entire future and future lifetime for the fetus?\n\n \n Because it is her body. None other should have the right to use it against her will.\n \n \n\n On what basis do you feel a right should be given if it is a malevolent right to kill? (as in abortion)\n\n \n I do not believe it is a malevolent right. I believe it is a right that is part of a free society. The basis is that the gov't should never violate rights to ensure another's survival. That is a step toward fascism.\n \n Your justifications of \"9 months isn't so bad\" and \"abortion infringes on the fetus' rights\" are not sufficient, imo, to violate women's rights. The fetus should not have the ability to infringe on the woman's rights, and violating a woman's rights is not moral no matter how long it is for.",
