   "Piggybacking on the poll thread, \"Government overstepping\" I have a topic for discussion. Should healthcare professionals be able to follow their consciences concerning certain moral issues, such as abortion? I think of Catholic hospitals that provide outstanding care, but do not provide abortion, nor contraception, for example, or the doctor who will not assist in any euthanasia. Your thoughts?",

   "I think it is important to first point out the difference in a passive action and an active action. If you refuse to give someone a kidney that they need then you might be considered to passivly harm them...you would like to see them get a kidney and not have the disease they currently have. Active action would be to kill the person because he wants your kidney. Or, because a baby can only survive in your womb you activly seek to kill it. \n \n Now on to the hospital. If hospital refuses to offer an abortion or whatever, I find this very much ok. You shouldn't force people to do something unless by them not doing it is activly hurting someone. For example, if the hospital says \"yeah we will take this gunshot victim and fix him up so he can live\" and then when he arrives at the hospital you say \"no, he is a homosexual we won't help him\". I think you are responsible at that point. That is a rather extreme example of a life and death situation though. Abortion, no. Not only is it 99% of the time not harming the woman (as in a life threat) but even by never offering you are just in a passive manner. \"we don't offer that procedure\" just like a family doctor doesn't offer brain surgery.",
