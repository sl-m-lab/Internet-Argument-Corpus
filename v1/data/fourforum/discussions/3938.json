Recently, Clinton had tighter pursestrings than Ike and Bush makes Teddy Kennedy appear as a skinflint. Both went overboard in using their office to reward supporters. What is this current fascination with tradition and what's driving it?\n\n I think it's mainly fear, George. Fear of the unknown, basically. We are in a position where the shape of this nation is unknown - a place never seen by the majority of the populace. They know what we once were, or at least could still see or feel it, but now have no idea where we are or where we're headed.\n \n Organizations punch away at the nations moral infrastructure to see just how tough we are - sort of a semi-suicide attempt, IMO. When this happens people feel unprotected by the usual, or normal \"that's the way it's always been and will continue to be\" shield, and panic. Leaping back towards a traditional state is just a reaction, even though the place they land is still just as foreign. During these birthing pangs of a new era you'll see organizations (such as the democratic party is doing now) trying to be part of that backwards leap and all the while realizing that the key to the Time Machine really ain't gonna fit.\n \n The only way out of this crisis is to have a government committed to leading us into a new era, who has the detailed plans laid out on the table and a sign out front, stating, \"Open House\".",

Known as a melting pot of people, and excluding Native Americans, the original culture of the US, other than some regional music, the entertainment industry and a standard of living we're preparing to pay the price for, what original cultural traditions other than our form of government have we developed as a nation to cling to?\n\n It's true, American cultural traditions were, in the last analysis, imported from the places from which the immigrants originated (as you say excluding the indigenous Native Americans). Many ethnic groups came to the US not simply hoping to grasp the economic opportunities they believed awaited them in the \"New World\", but also to escape from persecutions that attacked their liberties and their cultural identities. By now, after 350 years (roughly) of the melting pot cooking away, a distinctively American identity has been formed with recognisable political and cultural attributes of its own.\n You've already mentioned American government - which is arguably a unique contribution to political thought and the source of your liberty, unity, power, and prosperity. A by-product of this contribution is (or used to be) American moral leadership which, acting as an apostle of liberty, sought to bring the benefits of the American Creed to other less fortunate societies.\n As for distinctive cultural attributes, I believe they add up to more than (say) just country music and a religion of consumerism: the whole question of American individualism would have to be explored for example, before some conclusions could be drawn.",

   "Europeans, who originated those traditions, are generally considered far more liberal than the US and are not experiencing anywhere near the levels of deterioration in marriage and other social issues present in the US. \n\n \n It would be interesting to compare European liberalism with U.S liberalism. I suspect it would be an apples to oranges comparison. I'd bet their liberalism has to do with their tradition, and hasn't changed much over the past several decades. U.S liberalism has drastically changed over only a few decades, and that can be a cause of frustration that can fill prisions and cause more divorce. The rather recent U.S anti-smoking hysteria comes to mind, I don't think it's near as prominent in Europe. New environmental and safety laws can quickly ruin businesses. 30 or 40 years ago, businesses could long term plan much better than they can today in the U.S. The results are more short-term, fast buck businesses. Our liberalism also has to do with class warfare, and in our country with diverse cultures, a variety of climates and resources over our vast 50 states, and the fact that we are divided into states with one central federal government, make a comparision with us and Europe pretty meaningless. \n \n \n You should consider finding a new target for the cause of some of our social problems.

   "I'm reading a great many references to tradition in posts both political and non-political. More than I can remember since living in the South (US) many years ago. On the political side it seems to me that those references are repeatedly directed to issues that reflect both domestic and foreign policy by political affiliation. What piques my curiosity is the fact that neither major political party has adhered to their traditional values over many administrations. Recently, Clinton had tighter pursestrings than Ike and Bush makes Teddy Kennedy appear as a skinflint. Both went overboard in using their office to reward supporters. What is this current fascination with tradition and what's driving it?\n\n \n Tradition is a poor-man's reasoning. Poor men are driving it. (figurative)\n \n Tradition to most americans is a about a 30 year period or less. Some cultures have strong roots, most don't seem to.\n Traditionally blacks didn't live in america. Traditionally blacks were slaves in america. Traditionally blacks were segregated forcefully in america. Traditionally blacks were forcefully integrated into america. Traditionally blacks are an important part of american society. Tradition isn't a very useful word, or reason for doing anything.\n \n Tradition, as a subsitute for critical thinking, in general, it's not a good thing. Specifically, it can be, but only coincidentally.\n \n Here's an example of tradition defined and what it means:\n Webster defined:\n 1 : an inherited, established, or customary pattern of thought, action, or behavior (as a religious practice or a social custom)\n \n Catholic defined:\n http://www.the-tidings.com/2001/0810/davidsonsigns.htm\n \n Moreover, in Tilley's words, \"as practices change, the significance of the concepts and beliefs they carry change.\" Thus, the content of the Catholic tradition unfolds differently in relation to the variety of circumstances affecting the interaction between the people handing it on and the people receiving it.\n \n It seems tradition, handed down customs and patters of though or action or behavior, change. \n \n Then in conclusion, what is the meaning of tradition? \n \n Thinking, acting, behaving, based on how someone else tells you to.\n \n Good 'ole submission...err..tradition!\n \n \n -Mach",

There are two ways in which that can happen:\n \n A) Asserting that a political system is good just because it is traditional\n <or<\n B) Asserting that a political system is bad just because it is traditional\n \n In either case, tradition dictates our political thinking. For these reasons I think our politics should pursue a course detached from tradition. That is, we think up political systems as if we didn't know traditions even existed. We should devise a political system based on its benefits, not its adherence (or lack thereof) to tradition.",

   "It's just classical libertarianism. The problem with libertarianism is that it flirts too much with anarchy in this day and time. And while you say that your philosophy worked for many years in our country, that doesn't mean it will now. This is not the 18th and 19th centuries--now we have things like fully automatic weapons, more powerful explosives, terribly addictive and harmful drugs available such as cocaine, and cars that go a lot faster therefore much more dealier accidents (mandating airbags and seatbelt laws).\n\n \n \n Bull.\n \n We have had machine guns for a LONG time. Before that, we had a population that routinely kept cannons and artillery pieces around. It was not a problem then, nor is it a problem today. For YEARS you could buy tommmy guns mail order from sears. No big deal. I have several of them in my basement. They are legal to own, you just have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get one. Interestingly enough, there has never been a case of a legally owned and registered machine gun being used in the comission of a crime. As far as I am concerned, Machine gun ownership pretty much wraps the argument against gun control up into a nice little package. The federal government can at any given time put its finger on every legally owned civilian machine gun int his country. If I travel out of state and take one with me, the feds have to be informed. All this has done is created a black market for illegal machine guns. They are still widely available on the street.\n \n For years, you could buy morphine over the counter at your local drug store. Morphine is classed as one of the most addictive drugs out there. It wasn't a problem.\n \n you are telling me that a 2001 honda civic is more powerful than a '68 GTO? Are you on crack? Cars have gotten weaker, not mroe powerful. We traded horsepower for torque (which is why todays cars with 300 HP are wimpy compared to cars of yesteryear with 300 HP).\n \n You are right. These are libertarian principals I am talking about here. You leave people alone unless they do something wrong, then you punish tyeh wrongdoer. You don't punish people or interfere in their lives \n \n Libertarianism is not even close to anarchy. Libertarianism depends largely on personal responsibility, though. If you take drugs and end up an addict, that is your own fault. That is a decision you made and you are responsible for it. If you drive around in a car that doesnt have any safety equipment and you are killed, that is your fault, nobody elses. You are responsible for your decisions. \n \n The only way the government can protect you all the time is by controlling you all the time. You are really so terrified of the world and of taking responsibility for your actions that you are willing to be controlled all time?\n \n I'm sorry, I know it is scary to be an adult and have to be on your own and take responsibility for your own actions, but it is time to move out of your parents basement and get your own apartment. While there are certainly downsides to this (like nobody there to pick up the pieces when you fall on your behind), You will really learn to love the freedom that comes with being an adult.\n \n It is time for amwericans to grow up and cut the cord.",

   "The problem is right out there in the open, but beating it to death will require our general public, carefully focused by those politicians to accept deception and lies, to again take individual responsibility. To drag that public away from its spectator sports and escapism pit of apathy will require that our rough patch turn into a disaster in one form or another. That's the only thing that will get their attention.\n\n \n This reminds me of something I saw the other day. I don't remember where or the exact wording, but allow me to paraphrase:\n \n \"We have reached a delicate time in the development of America. It is too late to work within the syatem, and too early to shoot the batsards\"\n \n \nNo, there is no difference. It's all personal liberty, and it's all good.\n\n \n Hmmm, you would be a good libertarian. I have tried for a long time to come up with a good definition of libertarian. The best I can do is:\n \n Somebody who believes the 9th ammendment is the most important one.\n \n I think that is a pretty good definition. While the other ammendments in the bill of rights are certainly important, I think that to libertarians, the 9th is really the biggie. It reads:\n \n \n \nAmendment IX\n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n \n \n The idea behind the 9th ammendment (and we know this because there was quite a bit written about all the amendments at the time), was that unless the government could show some pretty compelling evidence that showed that a particular activity was NOT a right, then it certainly is.",

   "Bull.\n \n\n \n Daaewoo, let me explain this a bit better.\n \n Gun control, seatbelt laws, etc. are mostly products of the 20th century. It is no accident that the decline of libertarianism coincided with the industrial revolution and technology. Sure, guns were around in the 19th century, but automatic weapons were not available to the populace at all--the gatling gun was a military device. It was advanced for it's time sort of like a satellite-guided portable missile system might be today, which you don't see among civilians. Incidently, the first gun control laws that were really 'felt' by citizens came about after repeating firearms came on the scene, such as revolvers and repeating rifles such as the Winchester. But by today's standard those laws were light--they've increased in regulation as the power and potential for most harm has increased in firearms. (Face it, a modern Beretta 92 FS 9mm semi-auto handgun with a 15 round magazine firing semi-jacketed hollow point rounds has more potential to be deadly than the Colt Army percussion cap 6 shooters of the 19th century. Even more so than the cartridge revolvers that would come soonafter.)\n \n Transportation in the 19th century and before didn't warrant setbelts as much (though sometimes they existed, believe it or not), because there were not as many vehicles on the roads and the vehicles were animal powered. Seat belts just weren't warranted. They didn't regulate them because they didn't have to. It wasn't an issue.\n \n Drugs? There were some high powered addictive drugs available pre-20th century, such as opium. But again, we have to note technology. Medical technology at the time didn't have a good handle on issues such as addictiveness and what drugs truly worked for various problems. Chemistry was not as advanced and it was not as clear as to the specific effects of drugs on the human body. Again, as technology increased, and as more and more drugs because possible to be manufactured, drug control laws came on the scene.\n \n The bottom line is this: you have technology to blame for the demise of libertarianism. For what it's worth, I am in agreement with you to some extent. I don't like gun control laws either, and I applaud the fact that the assault weapons ban just expired. I also don't like seat belt laws. I'm less inclined to oppose drug laws, mainly because drugs have a nasty tendency to get into the hands of children sometimes. (Guns can as well, but guns rights are specifically protected by the constitution, so that's a much different issue.)",

Even more so than the cartridge revolvers that would come soonafter.)\n\n \n Between the 1880's when the maxim was invented (and the maxim was available to the public) and the passage of the NFA (1938) every gun company ont he planet was developing and selling machine guns to civilians. It wasn't a problem and STILL isn't. Machine guns being used by criminals was most prevelant during and directly following prohibition. The number of people being killed by machine guns, even at the height of machine gun violence, was still smaller than the number of people clubbed to death with rocks (JUST rocks, not clubs or saps or anything else. ROCKS ONLY, and rocks were a pretty uncommon murder weapons). \n \n Sure the beretta is more deadly than a precussion colt, but it far less deadly than the BAR (Browning automatic rifle) which was available to the public for years. In fact, up until the passage of the NFA, mor BARs were sold to civilains than the government. \n \n Your argument here does nothing as far as advancing your anti-libertarianism argument. The libertarins argument regarding gun control and such is that we should not punish people who have not broken the law. If you use a gun to break a law, you should certianly be punished for it. If you own a howitaer but break no law, it is nobodies business but your own.\n \n As an interesting side not, the rate fo firearms related murder was over 700 higher in the first decade of the 19th century than it is today. This is true of most of the early 19th century. The invention of the repeating firearm (winchester, colt, sharps, etc....) actually preceded a GREAT drop in firearms violence. Armed with such a weapon, a single man could put up a reasonable defense against an entire group of would be attackers. There was a similar drop in crime following the widespread adoption of automatics, which provided even more forepower in an individuals hands. Witht he advent of widespread adoption of gun control, crime went up, not down.\n \n \nTransportation in the 19th century and before didn't warrant setbelts as much (though sometimes they existed, believe it or not), because there were not as many vehicles on the roads and the vehicles were animal powered. Seat belts just weren't warranted. They didn't regulate them because they didn't have to. It wasn't an issue.\n\n \n It was not until the late 80s or early 90s that we saw widespread adoption of seatbelt laws. We made it through the eara of muscle cars and well into the era of low powered imports bevore seatbelt usage became mandatory. Many states still haven't adopted mandatroy seatbelt laws.\n \n Interestingly enough, the current trend of producing safer cars was not the result of governement meddling. It was the result of a free market, personal choice, and the volvo. The volvo was marketed based on its safety features, and the factory was months behind on their orders. American consumers, particularly family types, were keen on the idea of a safer kiddy hauler. Automobiles makers were already working to develop and integrate better safety features when the government stepped in and mandated it. The free market and informed decision were already driving automakers to integrate safety features. \n \n \nDrugs? There were some high powered addictive drugs available pre-20th century, such as opium. But again, we have to note technology. Medical technology at the time didn't have a good handle on issues such as addictiveness and what drugs truly worked for various problems. Chemistry was not as advanced and it was not as clear as to the specific effects of drugs on the human body. Again, as technology increased, and as more and more drugs because possible to be manufactured, drug control laws came on the scene.\n\n \n You are once again wrong. Opiates and narcotics were widely known to be addictive as early as the 13th century. The effects of the poppy were well understood by the incas, including its addictive effects. \n \n Beyond that, such as potential negative effects, who cares? If somebody wants to snort a pound fo cocain a day and destroy their body, what business is it of mine? \n \n \nThe bottom line is this: you have technology to blame for the demise of libertarianism.

(Guns can as well, but guns rights are specifically protected by the constitution, so that's a much different issue.)\n\n \n All you effectively are arguing here is for the existance of a nanny state. We shouldn't have machine guns because some people are too irresponsible to own them. We should require people to wear seat belts because people are too stupid to make an informed decision on their own. We should not allow people to do drugs for the saem reason.\n \n One of the cornerstones of the libertarian movement is that victimless crimes are not crimes at all. If you do not hurt anybody, and do not infringe on the rights of another person, and the only person potentially harmed by your actions is you, how is this a crime? Punishing people for victimless crimes is essentially punishing them for failing to bow down beofre their government.
