   "John Ashcroft, yes that one, wrote an essay in 1997 addressing his concerns for citizens' privacy. Yet, we are told that John Ashcroft is the enemy of citizens' privacy. Is John Asscroft flip flopping?\n \n http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itgic/1097/ijge/gj-7.htm\n \nThere is a concern that the Internet could be used to commit crimes and that advanced encryption could disguise such activity. However, we do not provide the government with phone jacks outside our homes for unlimited wiretaps. Why, then, should we grant government the Orwellian capability to listen at will and in real time to our communications across the Web?\n \n The protections of the Fourth Amendment are clear. The right to protection from unlawful searches is an indivisible American value. Two hundred years of court decisions have stood in defense of this fundamental right. The state's interest in effective crime-fighting should never vitiate the citizens' Bill of Rights.\n\n \n \n What about this?\n http://www.aclu.org/Privacy/Privacy.cfm?ID=15264&c=39\n \n \nIf implemented, this Ashcroft plan would dramatically increase the government's surveillance power and risk making surveillance and privacy violations much more widespread. It would force technology companies to build \"backdoors\" in their systems for wiretapping and thereby create weaknesses that hackers, thieves and rogue government agents could exploit to invade your privacy and conduct identity theft.\n\n \n http://www.epic.org/privacy/ashcroft_ltr_5_01.html\n \n\n Dear Attorney General Ashcroft:\n \n .....\n \n The FBI's current use of the Carnivore system (and the various other versions of that system) threatens the privacy of electronic communications and cannot be squared with the Fourth Amendment, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Carnivore gives law enforcement agencies not only direct access to communications involving the target of a court order, but access as well to the communications of many non-target subscribers of the Internet Service Provider where it is installed. This threatens everyone's privacy.\n\n \n Which is it Jonny? Do you defend the fourth amendment or don't you?",
