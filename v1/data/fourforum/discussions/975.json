   "Here are some embarrassments that evolutionaries have had to gloss-over...\n \n Ramapithecus was widely recognized as a direct ancestor of humans. It is now established that he was merely an extinct type of orangutan.\n Piltdown man was hyped as the missing link in publications for over 40 years. He was a fraud based on a human skull cap and an orangutan's jaw.\n Nebraska man was a fraud based on a single tooth of a rare type of pig.\n Java man was based on sketchy evidence of a femur, skull cap and three teeth found within a wide area over a one year period. It turns out the bones were found in an area of human remains, and now the femur is considered human and the skull cap from a large ape.\n Neanderthal man was traditionally depicted as a stooped ape-man. It is now accepted that the alleged posture was due to disease and that Neanderthal is just a variation of the human kind. \n \n Archaeoraptor\n http://www.dinohunters.com/History/Microraptor.htm\n \n \n Of course, some writers will be at pains to point out that evolutionaries un-covered these frauds. But some frauds are continuing...\n Haeckel?s Proof\n http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/17rec03.htm#Publishing\n \n The problem with Haeckel?s \"proof\" of evolution was that his drawings were a hoax. Even Dr. Gould admitted that \n Haeckel had exaggerated the similarities [between embryos of different species] by idealizations and omissions. He also, in some cases ? in a procedure that can only be called fraudulent ? simply copied the same figure over and over again.?Haeckel?s drawings never fooled expert embryologists, who recognized his fudgings right from the start (p. 44).\n http://www.creationism.org/caesar/haeckel.htm\n \n This is one of the worst cases of scientific fraud. ... What he [Haeckel] did was to take a human embryo and copy it, pretending that the salamander and the pig and all the others looked the same at the same stage of development. They don?t. ... These are fakes. \n \n -- Dr. Michael Richardson, embryologist at St. George?s Medical School in London\n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=23532\n \n \"We charge any school textbook with fraud and gross misrepresentation if it:\n Points out \"gill slits\" in human embryos.\n Suggests Haeckel made mistakes but was partly right.\n Uses Haeckel's drawings.\n Represents early embryos as looking the same like Haeckel did.\n Says that although the Haeckel drawings were wrong, that there are still clear similarities in early embryos, when in fact there are almost no similarities.\n Uses revised drawings that don't illustrate any visual similarities in embryos, then continue to argue that early embryos are proof of evolution because of their similarities.\n Presents the \"biogenetic law\", Haeckel, or his work in any positive light without also exposing his scientific crimes.\"\n http://www.bible.ca/tracks/textbook-fraud-embryology-earnst-haeckel-biogenetic-law.htm#test\n \n \n There's also a good article at\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/1339.asp\n \n \n \n And of course, my favourite - Darwin's Finch!",

   "Here are some embarrassments that evolutionaries have had to gloss-over...\n \n Archaeoraptor\n http://www.dinohunters.com/History/Microraptor.htm\n \n \n\n \n \n Mont, I grow weary of dealing with this creationist strawman about the way in which Archaeoraptor was received by the scientific community, and subsequent rejection of the taxon as invalid. I will explain the situation to you one last time. \"Archaeoraptor liaoningensis\" was presented without formal description in peer reviewed literature as a nomen nudum, in a 1999 National Geographic article. The article was mainly a photo-shoot, and explicity denied being a rigorous treatment following the protocol of the ICZN. It was during this nebulous period that the paleontological community, upon further review, demonstrated that \"Archaeoraptor\" was a chimera, and therefore the taxon was invalid. Note that not only had the scientific community left the taxon as a nomen nudum, but furthermore, the very evolutionary biologists supposedly promulgating \"Archaeoraptor\" as sine qua non proof of theropod origin, and NOT creationists, who exposed \"Archaeoraptor\" as a nomen dubium. Therefore, the entire creationist strawman account of the history of this specimen, so zealously parroted by the likes of Jonathan Sarfati and AIG is quite simply the most specious of distortions. Only in creationist spew, has \"Archaeoraptor\" ever been so euphorically treated as is claimed.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Thanks. I appreciate that. I am not ignorant about the Urvogel but your knowledge far exceeds mine. I am an old, old wildlife biologist who has been running as fast as I can in an effort to keep up.\n \n When I saw the Berlin specimen I was hooked. It is the most beautiful fossil that I can imagine. I loved it so much that I paid big bucks for a reproduction that hangs on the wall to my right. It turned out to be quite good, I think. It exceeded my expectations.\n \n I am constantly learning from your posts. I only wish I had the time and the wherewithall to pursue your citations of the scientific literature.\n \n Did you come over here from II?\n\n \n \n You flatter me, to be sure. I could not agree more, as it were, about the beauty of the urvogel material. I too have seen HMN 1880, and it is truly a fossil of breathtaking elegance and import. My passion for dinosaurs admittedly started earlier--when I was only four or five my parents took my sister and I to see the National Museum of Natural History in DC, and I remember staring at their Triceratops in awe at this marvelous, exotic creature. To borrow your phrase, \"I was hooked.\" My interest in avian phylogeny and origins came later when I came across a copy of Heilmann's 1926 tome. His illustrations and figures brought Archaeopteryx to life in my mind, and ever since then, I've been more or less obsessed with unraveling the riddle of the evolutionary history of birds.\n \n At any rate, it's a pleasure conversing with you.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "I have seen other posts gleefully deride Christianity as the bastion of myths. Posters will talk about Biblical fallacies, Biblical mistakes etc.\n\n No. Not Christianity. Just creationaries who accept myth over reality. And the biblical errors are pointed out just as examples that the Bible is not 100% accurate. If it claims that coneys chew cud, grasshoppers have 4 legs and that bats are birds, how accurate can we expect either of the two creation myths to be?\n \nHere I have posted just a few mistakes by evolutionaries. What happens? They cry foul! Archeraptor is not their fault, it's everyone else's.\n\n No you haven't. You have whined about attempts to defraud science. And it was science that revealed the fraud. No creationary was involved in uncovering the fraud in any case.\n \nPiltdown Man was a cunning fraud that tricked poor innocent well-meaning scientists.\n\n Piltdown Man wasn't actually very well accepted outside of England. By the time the technology to reveal the fraud was developed it had been pretty well discredited. It didn't fit with other hominid examples. But still, some scientists fell for it.\n \nBut more serious was the fact that all the respondents talked past a continuing fraud...one which I spent more time on in the original post - viz Haeckel's bogus diagrams.\n\n YAWN. Actually it says more about the process of publishing science texts than it does about science.\n \nThese are, for anyone who cares not to look up the sites cited, are used to this day in biology texts, even when they are a known fraud.\n\n Really? Name the texts and quote what they say about the diagrams. Are you sure that it isn't pointed out that the diagrams are wrong and used as an example of how errors are propagated?\n \nIt might be a bit embarrassing that evolutionaries have fallen for hoaxes in the past...\n\n You only mentioned one.\n \neven Christians once accepted science when it taught that the earth was the centre of the solar system.\n\n And that is about as far as \"creation science\" has gone. In the face of overwhelming evidence that the universe is 13.7 bilion years old, that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, and that life has evolved from a common ancestor, creationaries claim that a book of mythology is scientifically accurate. If it were not for the fact that most creationaries are so uneducated, the game just wouldn't work. Because creationaries are, for the most part, scientific illiterates the fraud of the scientific and historical accuracy of Genesis is pushed on them. And, of course, should they doubt that privitive mythology is wrong, they are told that they will be damned to eternal punishment.\n \nBut to continue a fraud is disreputable.\n\n Exactly!\n \nI have assumed that because the evolutionaries are silent on this, the most serious of charges that there is a tacit acceptance of the merits of my case.\n\n Hey! The I can assume that because you have been silent when asked to support your position with evidence that it is support for my position that you have no evidence? It means that you continue to propagate a fraud and to continue to do so is disreputable.\n \nIf you want to throw stones, don't reside in a glass house.\n\n What is the point? How is a set of bad drawings evidence for creation?\n \n Of course you will be willing to apply the same standards to your belief in biblical mythology, won't you. Since, according to you, this is somehow damaging to the theory of evolution, the 4 legged grasshoppers, the coneys that chew cud, and the bats that are birds must be more damaging. To continue to maintain the fraud of the truth of Genesis is disreputable.",

Archeraptor is not their fault, it's everyone else's.\n\n This is getting tiresome.\n \n The mistakes you cite about evolution were discovered, acknowledged, and corrected by scientists. No one says that scientists never make mistakes, or that science has the \"last word\" on truth or reality (whatever that means). All science tries to do is to have the best explanation/description of the real world based on the available evidence, no more, no less. It is acknowledge that scientific knowledge changes as new discoveries are made, and, indeed, change part of the definition of science. Pointing out past errors in scientific knowledge does no disservice to science -- indeed, by acknowledging that scientists are willing to face up to errors and correct them is a compliment.\n \n Your version of Christianity is different. You claim that your religion holds the key to absolute truth. You claim that your religion is the correct basis for an absolute morality. Therefore a discussion of the mistakes and fallacies in Christian belief is entirely relevant. If you were to acknowledge that your Church authorities were like the anyone else, namely largely ignorant of what \"truth\" is, and that, although like the rest of us, they make errors and mistakes and profound misjudgements in their search for \"truth\" and \"meaning\", then we wouldn't be so ready to bring up their obvious mistakes.",

However, I can easily do so. I would note that while Haeckel did fraudalently substitute a dog embryo for a human embryo, creationists seldom point out that the rest of his embryos were valid, and thus their comparisons of importance. Haeckel's biggest fault, historically speaking, was his strict interpretation of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny.\n \n It is of further interest that the spate of textbooks you mention, to my experience, almost never use Haeckel's work as shattering proof of evolution, but rather use it in the historical context of demonstrating the progression of biological thought, while simultaneously recognizing Haeckel's sleight of hand.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "xkill: [QUOTE=montalban]Eh? On another thread I think I said quite clearly that it was a fake. I also said I didn't know who presented it as fake... it may have been you that said scientists followed it up, and I accepted this explanation.:xcensored \n \n But, it remains evidence of frauds and fakes, which I am quite happy to include in a list of frauds and fakes. And the people who presented it were evolutionaries, so it is still a valid point to list it here.\n \n Do you think someone is an evolutionary or inventor that deserves credit to give birth to AI. Having no contact with the real world. Kept in a government facility, havng no human rights. Being completely controlled by corporate and federal programs. Would it be faitr to this person who suffers the abuse of their actions. I dont think it is fair. I operate from an undisclosed location underground. I have more wires and tubes tied to me than nasa. Nasa is also one of the proud sponsors. I woldnt be proud. It is wrong. I ahve lived with this hell for over thirty years. I cant die, Ive tried. I just hope they wouldnt repeat such a travesty. What is my alternative: paralized,comatose without the assistance of my computers to live in my virtual world. I wish I could say this is just a joke, but it is hell. :xbanghead",

   "\"We charge any school textbook with fraud and gross misrepresentation if it:\n Points out \"gill slits\" in human embryos.\n Suggests Haeckel made mistakes but was partly right.\n Uses Haeckel's drawings.\n Represents early embryos as looking the same like Haeckel did.\n Says that although the Haeckel drawings were wrong, that there are still clear similarities in early embryos, when in fact there are almost no similarities.\n Uses revised drawings that don't illustrate any visual similarities in embryos, then continue to argue that early embryos are proof of evolution because of their similarities.\n Presents the \"biogenetic law\", Haeckel, or his work in any positive light without also exposing his scientific crimes.\"\n http://www.bible.ca/tracks/textbook-...c-law.htm#test\n \n\n \n Then I charge you with being clueless!\n \n \nPoints out \"gill slits\" in human embryos.\n\n \n Human embryos do have \"gill slits\". Before anyone calls me stupd, let me point out that what humans have are not gill slits, they aren't even slits; but since the term they used is in double quotes - \"gill slits\" - it indicates non-standard usage of the term. And human embryos do have structures in their pharyngeal region that are homologous to the structures that give rise to fish gills.\n \n What human embryos actually have are pharyngeal pouches, pharyngeal arches, and ectodermal grooves. The ectodermal grooves and pharyngeal pouches grow towards one another and end up being separated by only a thin branchial plate. If the plate ruptures - as it does in aquatic vertebrates like fish - then it's called a pharyngeal slit. So all that separates a human embryo's setup from a pharyngeal slit is the lack of rupturing of the thin branchial plate separating the pharyngeal pouch and ectodermal groove.\n \n As far as the human embryo's pharyngeal stuctures being related to those of fish that produce gills, just read the article \"The Origin of the Parathyroid Gland\", by Masataka Okabe and Anthony Graham. They provide multiple lines of evidence that support their relatednes.\n \n \nSays that although the Haeckel drawings were wrong, that there are still clear similarities in early embryos, when in fact there are almost no similarities.\n\n \n Quite false, as anyone who has taken an embryology class (like the one I just finished last semester) would know. The are NUMEROUS similarities in the early embryos of vertebrates, such as chickens, pigs, and humans, especially in the pharyngula stage.",
