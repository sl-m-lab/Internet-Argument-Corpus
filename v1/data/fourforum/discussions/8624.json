Grow up, daewoo. Contrary to your wild, unsupported claim that I share pretty much all of their viewpoints, I share little with them...and certainly not as much as you do. I don't send them money.\n \n Your definition of fascism is skewed to make it appear that anti-liberalism implies fascism. Here are some other interpretations of fascism.\n \n \n http://www.publiceye.org/eyes/whatfasc.html\n Fascism is a form of extreme right-wing ideology that celebrates the nation or the race as an organic community transcending all other loyalties. It emphasizes a myth of national or racial rebirth after a period of decline or destruction. To this end, fascism calls for a \"spiritual revolution\" against signs of moral decay such as individualism and materialism, and seeks to purge \"alien\" forces and groups that threaten the organic community. \n \n Fascism tends to celebrate masculinity, youth, mystical unity, and the regenerative power of violence. Often, but not always, it promotes racial superiority doctrines, ethnic persecution, imperialist expansion, and genocide.\n \n \n At the same time, fascists may embrace a form of internationalism based on either racial or ideological solidarity across national boundaries. \n \n Usually fascism espouses open male supremacy, though sometimes it may also promote female solidarity and new opportunities for women of the privileged nation or race.\n \n Fascism's approach to politics is both populist--in that it seeks to activate \"the people\" as a whole against perceived oppressors or enemies--and elitist--in that it treats the people's will as embodied in a select group, or often one supreme leader, from whom authority proceeds downward. \n \n Fascism seeks to organize a cadre-led mass movement in a drive to seize state power. It seeks to forcibly subordinate all spheres of society to its ideological vision of organic community, usually through a totalitarian state. Both as a movement and a regime, fascism uses mass organizations as a system of integration and control, and uses organized violence to suppress opposition, although the scale of violence varies widely.\n \n Fascism is hostile to Marxism, liberalism, and conservatism, yet it borrows concepts and practices from all three. Fascism rejects the principles of class struggle and workers' internationalism as threats to national or racial unity, yet it often exploits real grievances against capitalists and landowners through ethnic scapegoating or radical-sounding conspiracy theories. \n \n Fascism rejects the liberal doctrines of individual autonomy and rights, political pluralism, and representative government, yet it advocates broad popular participation in politics and may use parliamentary channels in its drive to power. \n \n Its vision of a \"new order\" clashes with the conservative attachment to tradition-based institutions and hierarchies, yet fascism often romanticizes the past as inspiration for national rebirth.\n \n Fascism has a complex relationship with established elites and the non-fascist right. It is never a mere puppet of the ruling class, but an autonomous movement with its own social base. \n \n In practice, fascism defends capitalism against instability and the left, but also pursues an agenda that sometimes clashes with capitalist interests in significant ways. \n \n There has been much cooperation, competition, and interaction between fascism and other sections of the right, producing various hybrid movements and regimes. \n \n \n \n \n http://www.remember.org/hist.root.what.html\n \n Fascism\n Chip's definition: \n Extreme racial or cultural nationalism combined with economic corporatism and authoritarian autocracy; masked during its rise to state power by pseudo-radical populist appeals to overthrow a conspiratorial elitist regime; spurred by a strong charismatic leader whose reactionary ideas are said to organically express the will of the masses who are urged to engage in a heroic collective effort to attain a metaphysical goal against the machinations of a scapegoated demonized adversary.\n \n \n Definition excepted from \"A Dictionary of Political Thought\" by Roger Scruton. (The Macmillan Press, London, 1982, p. 169) \n \"An amalgam of disparate conceptions...more notable as a political phenomenon on which diverse intellectual influences converge than as a distinct idea; as political phenomenon, one of its most remarkable features has been the ability to win massive popular support for ideas that are expressly anti-egalitarian.\" \n \n \"Fascism is characterized by the following features (not all of which need be present in any of its recognized instances): nationalism; hostility to democracy, to egalitarianism, and to the values of the enlightenment; the cult of the leader, and admiration for his special qualities; a respect for collective organization, and a love of the symbols associated with it, such as uniforms, parades and army discipline.\"\n \n \"The ultimate doctrine contains little that is specific, beyond an appeal to energy, and action.\"\n \n \n So, daewoo, why don't you drop the habit of calling people fascist when you have absolutely no logical reason to do so? Get away from your smear campaign and use some real logic for a change.\n \n \n \n \nEspecially one with leadership currently skirting constitutional rights under the guise of a phony war and demanding even more leeway in dealing with suspected enemies outside the judicial system. That's just a tiny step from charging any citizen with a 'special' crime to avoid having to deal with constitutional rights.\nA bit of strawman here, georged. Enemy combatants are generally not citizens.\n \n \n \n \nMy thoughts exactly.\n \n Like running around screaming about killing people somehow means you have \"bigger balls\". \n \n \nYou're close , Waxy. \n \n Running around screaming and killing people does not mean you have big balls. That's exactly what this shooter did and he has no balls at all. He's a coward.\n \n Running around screaming and killing people is what the Islamo-fascist radical Muslims are doing. They have no balls. They are cowards.\n \n What I propose is to identify, locate and terminate these people. We already have this one in a jail cell. Let's kill him.\n \n \n \n \n \nI love when differing from someones opinion is 'weak'. Such a convincing argument.\nIt's not that differing opinions are weak. The weakness shows more in the reluctance to fight back with extremely effective means, such as KILLING THE ENEMY.\n \n \n \n \nBecause killing one more person evens the score...\n \n Nope, stick him in jail for the next 50 years or so, he can have a good long think.\nIt's not about evening the score. It's about getting rid of murderous vermin.\n \n Sticking him in jail for 50 years only costs us thousands of dollars. Killing him can be cheap AND it solves the problem (as related to him) FOREVER!",

Merely pointing out that your view on this is pretty obviously dictated by your fascist viewpoints, and since the US is not generally considered a fascist country (though there is a growign fascist movement in the US) odds are that we are not goind to jump right in and give up trials just because guys like mussolini thought it was a good idea.\n \n \nWhereas you have admitted to supporting the Islamo-fascist terrorists and continue to make excuses for their actions, you are far closer to being fascist than I.\n\n \n Jim, Islamo-fascist is a term used by XXXXXX with no idea what fascism is. One of fascisms primary driving forces was hyper-nationalism. This extended to fascist like regimes as well (Nazis, etc...). The Muslims we are currently fighting (in fact, most Muslims) wholly reject the concept of nationalism. In fact, one of BLs stated goals is the return of a caliphate and removal of all national sovereignty lines in the ME. This has been a strong movement in the ME for years. Most people in the ME do not understand why the creation of nations was a necessity.\n \n \nApparently, not only do you need a lesson in logic, you need to expand your vision of fascism to include some less biased definitions. Looks like you depend on Wikipedia too much.\n\n \n Jim, both fo the links you posted are merely expansions on the definition I used (which I can almost gaurantee was copied out of a textbook somewhere). Anti liberal, socialist, and communist views were the driving force behind fascism. The fascist party in Britain, which held quite a bit of influence prior to WWII, owed its existence primarily to the anti liberal side of fascism. Fascism was primarily an anti liberal/socialist/communist institution. What made them worse than other similar institutions was the militarism, supranationalism, and authoritarianism. \n \n The wikipedia articvle on this is about as neutral as you can get without saying \"fascism is a form of government\" and leaving it at that. At one point the wikipedia article on fascism was contested becaus you pretty much could not read it wihtout getting the strong idea that Bush and CO were fascists (thats becuase they are). Like liberals, fascists don't like to be labeled for what they are, and enough raised a stink that the wikipedia definition was widened.\n \n \nYour propensity to label people as fascists (or nazis) is understood as your arguments are often too weak to be effective and the labels certainly paint your opponent as evil.\n \n Your logic error is to constantly claim the tag applies to me simply because I may do something that fascists do...like:\n\n \n Jim, you are arguing here that we should remove citizen justice, one of the primary tenants of democracy and self rule, in this case because a single liberal on the jury might be enough to completely invalidate our justice system. Inherent to that argument is the belief that the government is the sole safe repository for the power of justice. \n \n Its all there, Jim. Phobia of liberals and hyper authoritarianism all rolled up into one sick little argument.\n \n \nFascists wear brown shirts...Jim has a brown shirt...therefore Jim is a fascist.\n\n \n Nobody is suggesting that you are a fascist because you have brown shirts. I have never seen anybody suggest that. What I HAVE seen people suggest is that you should GET some brown shirts because you ARE a fascist. Big difference.\n \n \nThis is the false logic you use often. Grow up, daewoo. Contrary to your wild, unsupported claim that I share pretty much all of their viewpoints, I share little with them...and certainly not as much as you do. I don't send them money.\n\n \n Nor do I. Any suggestion that the islamic etremist are fascists just paints you as a XXXXX. \n \n I claim that you are a fascist because you pretty much seem to posess all the traits of a fascist, and I have seen you argue in favor of multiple fascist ideaologies. I don't thinkt hat we even need to discuss your militant ideology, or your hyper nationalism, and your fear of liberals is, as you have demonstrated in this thread, nearly pathological. I can not think of any of the primary tenents of fascism that you have not come out in support of at one time or another.",

Get some help.\n \n \n ..and as you may have guessed and will likely claim that I could not do so anyway, I will not waste time analyzing this latest delusion of yours.\n \n I will point out one blatant lie you told in the above quoted trash. The Wikipedia definition of Fascism is prefaced with a comment on neutrality saying, \"The neutrality of this article is disputed.\"\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism\n \n Check it out.\n \n I will also note the fact that the brown shirt example was meant to be only that...an example. I could have used any one of several examples to show your error in logic. You are simply too single-mindedly venomous to recognize it. That particular error is pointed on in many books on logic. Try reading one.\n \n Your ad hominem attacks make you unworthy of any respect.\n \n Continue to support the Islamo-fascist terrorists as you please, and continue to criticize me as you please. Any reader with a bit of common sense can see right through you.",
