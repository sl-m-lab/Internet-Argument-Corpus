   "  Most Say Stricter Gun Laws Would Not Help Prevent Shootings \n A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey, taken Monday and Tuesday nights, finds that only 29% of Adults think stricter gun control laws would help prevent shootings like the one in Arizona last Saturday. Sixty-two percent (62%) disagree and say stronger gun control would not make a difference.\n \n Among those who have a gun in their household, 76% say stricter gun control laws would not help, a view shared by a plurality (48%) of those without a gun in the house. \n \n Despite Saturday&#8217;s tragedy, opposition to gun control is at a new high. Thirty-six percent (36%) say the United States needs stricter gun control laws, but 56% don&#8217;t share that belief and oppose stronger anti-gun laws. Previously, opposition to more gun control has ranged from a high of 51% in July of last year to a low of 37% in April 2007 following the killings at Virginia Tech. \n \n Seventy-three percent (73%) of those who say someone in their household owns a gun oppose stricter gun control laws.

   "I really can't follow your train of thought on this one Brady. Where exactly are you laying your blame in this nonsensical post? Are you turning your fury on the existence of the Glock Model 19? The magazine? Against Loughner himself? Or are you blaming the NRA and the American people for the actions of a crazy psychotic?\n \n \nWASHINGTON, DC -- The same model handgun used in the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) and 19 others on Saturday was also used in the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, the Violence Policy Center (VPC) pointed out today in a backgrounder released on the Glock 19 pistol and ammunition magazine used in the Arizona attack (see http://www.vpc.org/fact_sht/AZbackgrounder.pdf for backgrounder).\n\n \n An interesting note is that one of weapons used in the Virginia Tech shooting was a Walther P22. A .22 rimfire pistol that uses a 10 round magazine, and for which no \"high capacity magazine\" design exists. It can't be modified in any way to hold more than 10 round of ammunition, but Cho Seung-Hui felt it necessary to have it as well.\n \n Guns Used At Virginia Tech Shootings by Cho Seung-Hui with Video\n \n \"Virginia Tech gunman Cho Seung-Hui used two weapons to carry out the murders at Virginia Tech, the Glock 19 and the Walther P22.\"\n \n \nSimilar semiautomatic firearms with high-capacity magazines have been used in most major mass shootings in the United States in the past 30 years.\n\n \n Exactly how many \"major mass shootings\" have there been in the United States in the past 30 years? How many victims are necessary for something to qualify as a \"major mass shooting\" as opposed to a regular shooting of criminal nature? Is there some sort of quota that needs to be met in order to be noteworthy?\n \n What is it that you and the Violence Policy Center do to set the standards? Is X number of bodies alright and acceptable, but X plus one more qualifies it as a \"major mass shooting\"? Is there a cut off point you know about that you aren't telling us? What's your criteria for making these determinations?\n \n Also, similar semiautomatic firearms with what you define as \"high capacity magazines\" have been available to the police since the 1970s, and have been used by countless honest law-abiding citizens for their own personal defense. The number of legal owners greatly outweighs the number of supposed \"mass shooters\" we keep hearing you talk about.\n \n \nThe VPC is calling on Congress to pass a new law banning the manufacture and sale of high-capacity magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. A similar ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines was in place for 10 years as part of the now-expired federal assault weapons ban.\n\n \n Here's the exact text of said ban.\n \n Bill Text - 103rd Congress (1993-1994) - THOMAS (Library of Congress)\n \n (a) PROHIBITION- Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by section 110102(a), is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n \n `(w)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.\n \n `(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.\n \n It says right there in black and white terms that the ban shall NOT apply to magazines that are owned prior to the enactment date of the legislation. Meaning that a countless number of magazines capable of holding more than 10 round of ammunition had immunity and couldn't be touched by the bill. So all a criminal had to do, if they wanted such magazines, was shop the second hand market, and there wasn't a thing you could do to stop them.\n \n Now let's take a look at another section of the language of this legislation.\n \n `(3) This subsection shall not apply to--\n \n `(A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);\n \n `(B) the transfer to a licensee under title I of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for purposes of establishing and maintaining an on-site physical protection system and security organization required by Federal law, or possession by an employee or contractor of such licensee on-site for such purposes or off-site for purposes of licensee-authorized training or transportation of nuclear materials;\n \n `(C) the possession, by an individual who is retired from service with a law enforcement agency and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving ammunition, of a large capacity ammunition feeding device transferred to the individual by the agency upon such retirement; or\n \n `(D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of any large capacity ammunition feeding device by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary.'.\n \n Now tell me something Brady. If these magazines only have criminal connections, connections that are so strong congress must be compelled to enact a total ban on civilian ownership of them, why exactly are the police being exempt from the ban? What business do the police have owning something that, as you yourself said in the same post, have been used in most major mass shootings in the United States in the past 30 years? Do these magazines somehow lose their criminal connection when they're used by the police? Doesn't that suggest they have legitimate uses for lawful purposes?\n \n And if they have legitimate uses for lawful purposes, why are they unsuitable for the civilian market?\n \n \n\"Simply put, high-capacity ammunition magazines make mass shootings possible by allowing shooters to fire multiple rounds very quickly without reloading. An effective ban on high-capacity magazines will help prevent tragedies like the one that claimed six lives and wounded numerous others last Saturday,\" said Kristen Rand, VPC legislative director. \"We can save lives in the future with this simple, effective proposal.\"\n VPC - Press Release - (01/10/2011) - Semiautomatic Pistol Used in Arizona Shooting Is Same Model Handgun Used in Virginia Tech Shooting\n\n \n See above for the response to this section. There was never a ban in place that would prevent people like Loughner from getting the magazines he was using at the time. Even if the 1994 ban had been in place he still would've gotten them, he'd just have to pay more for them than he did. But since he's mentally unstable I don't think money worried him very much so I doubt monetary concerns would have restrained him.",

   "This is the best response you can offer us Brady? I'm disappointed in your lack of effort.\n \n \nBut, here's the twist of irony Glenn Beck's image holding a gun appeared next to a quote where he condemns violence. It says, \"We must stand together against violence\".\n (Photo) Glenn Beck with a gun sent mixed messages\n\n \n I'm afraid I don't see any \"twist of irony\" in this matter. In the article you cite it specifically says that the image generator randomly changes the displayed image, so it's not like Glenn Beck has any control over what's displayed at any given moment. The fact that this image was displayed at this point of time is nothing more than mere coincidence and means nothing.\n \n It's already been pointed out that Loughner affiliated with neither the conservatives or liberals, and there's been no evidence to even suggest that he ever visited the websites of Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin or any other conservative member who advocated getting the democrats out of office. So unless new evidence is found, like documentation in Loughner's room in a secret drawer that he religiously subscribed to die-hard conservative political rhetoric, there's nothing to support the notion that his shooting Giffords was politically motivated. Instead all we have is an individual with schizophrenia who resided in his own little world where logic and reason didn't exist.\n \n The statue of Lady Justice, the one who's blindfolded and holding the scales of the law, the physical embodiment of fairness and proper justice, also holds a sword. Are we to assume that this means justice is violence and uncaring and will kill without discretion? If not then why bring up the image of Glenn Beck unless you're going to suggest the same thing; that the sight of a weapon entails violence against others?\n \n You might not be aware of this Brady, but us being armed doesn't mean that we're going to commit violence. We don't go armed to ensure that violent acts are carried out against others, we go armed in order to protect ourselves against violence. We don't shrink from it, we stand up and stop it. We don't retreat, we stand strong and overcome.\n \n Those who are bent on violence will harm us no matter what. It's only fair that we be able to protect ourselves when we need to. To demand we don't take such action is to say that our lives are worth nothing.\n \n And now how about you get to addressing the points I made which tear your article apart and show the folly that it really is.",

   "Read an article on RKBA for Friday that stated 65% of police and military WORLDWIDE, not only our cops, have adopted the Glock as their weapon of choice. Now they are \"evil\" because a nutcase used one?\n \n Funny thing, the same article noted Ohio gun purchases up over 60 percent since the Arizona event. Reckon they are all buying Glocks and spare mags and ammo? emoticon_xhoho",
