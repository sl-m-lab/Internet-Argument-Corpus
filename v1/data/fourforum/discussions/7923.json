   "I've heard that Russian official circles had already made decision of rejection of joining WTO. That discredits much Russian economical ministers Kudrin and Gref who had been insisting eagerly on Russian WTO membership and been promising that Russia and USA would come to agreement about Russian WTO joining in next one and a half monthes. \n Now they've fallen within unenviable condition because of their own shortsightedness for USA weren't going to make compromise with Russia. Moreover USA had changed radically their point of view since 1994. Then they were standing for Russian joining, last time they were putting spokes into Russian wheels inventing more and more new terms of Russian WTO membership for their East European partners' sake (Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine).\n It should be taken into account that Russia still couldn't take up worthy position in international trade system and joining WTO would just aggravate its dependence of world markets. In such conditions I consider Russian refusal of WTO membership is quite wise step.",
