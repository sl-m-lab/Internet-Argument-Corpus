And with all the flak from the recent NSA stories I can't see Bush thinking he has much to gain by pushing harder.

Curry, \"welcomed\" former Democratic presidential candidate Rev. Al Sharpton and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe.\n \n \"Rev. Sharpton, speaking from the pulpit, added to the politicized atmosphere by shouting, 'We're not people who are going to be beat twice,'\" Catholic League President William Donohue said.\n \n \"But no one was more partisan than McAuliffe: 'Bush has misled us for four years and will not mislead us for the next four years. Get out to vote and we'll send Bush back to Texas.' Consequently, the Catholic League will now ask the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of this church,\" he added.\n \n \"In what Donohue called \"an interesting turn of events,\" former President Bill Clinton spoke Sunday at New York's Riverside Church. \n \n \"Politics and political involvement dictated by faith is not the exclusive province of the right wing,\" Donohue quoted Clinton as saying. \n \n \"This is a remarkable statement coming from a leader of the Democratic Party. To be specific, John Kerry has said, 'I can't take my Catholic belief, my article of faith, and legislate it on a Protestant or a Jew or an atheist...' Thus does Kerry want to inoculate his religious views from his political positions?\" he asked.\n \n \"This is in sharp contrast to Bill Clinton's plea that one's politics should be dictated by one's faith,\" Donohue added.\n \n Also in contrast, Donohue said, Rev. George Rutler celebrated Mass Sunday in New York, which was \"well attended\" by Catholics who were in town for the convention.\n \n \"In a lengthy sermon, which focused on humility and the poor, Rutler made a passing reference to the controversy over Catholic pro-abortion politicians, saying that 'No one has a right to take Communion,'\" Donohue said.\n \n \"Yet this was enough for an AP reporter to say that 'church-state separation watchdogs' have said that 'Masses such as the one held Sunday amount to tacit political endorsement,'\" he added. \n \n \"Neither Clinton nor Rutler violated the IRS rules governing church and state. But McAuliffe crossed the line, hence the need to contact the IRS,\" Donohue concluded.",

   "I think that you are trying to draw connections that simply do not exist. The guy ignored the sopena they sent him months ago. The DOJ needed those records to continue thier investigation. Would you prefer that they simply say \"Oh well, he didn't send us the records, so he gets off even though we are absolutly positive that he is guilty\"?\n \n Seperation of powers means just that. The executive branch can not make laws, nor can the judicial branch. Congress cannot put people on trial, except in cases of impeachment, nor can they arrange an enforcement arm of congress to enforce the laws. The judicial branch cannot set up an enforcment arm either.\n \n There is absolutly no precedent for a \"seperation of powers\" argument to be used in this regard.

   "Jefferson got a subpoena?\n \n How come Tom DeLay was never subpoened?\n\n \n Yes. If you look into it, Jefferson recieved a sopena months ago and ignored it. The justice department sent repeated requests for him to comply with the sopena and he refused. \n \n The reason that congressmen are generally subpoened rather than raided is because they are expected to acto honorably and comply with such requests. You find the same thing in regular law enforcement. Police, SEC, IRS, etc... generally do not conduct raids if they believe they are dealing with womeody that will turn the records needed over voluntarily. \n \n Not long before I sold my business we were involved in an investigation by the justice department. There were 3 companies involved, mine, a major defense contractor, and another little business similar to mine. The major defense contractor and I both got \"requests\" for records and FBI agents called and made appointments to meet with me. The third guys business got raided and he got led off in handcuffs for questioning. \n \n At that time, they had NO idea which company was guilty (it turned out none were, it was incompetence at the DOD). The companies that got \"requests\" for records and appointments with FBI agents got them because the DOD was under the impresion that we were likely to cooperate and had more to loose by being obstructions than by just giving them whatever they needed. I know all the congressmen from my state, I know all our local officials, I even know most of the guys at the local FBI office. It would have been stupid for me to obstruct the investigation and ruin my reputation.\n \n The guy who got raided and led off in handcuffs for quesitoning was a scumbag (no longer in business) with ties to organized crime. \n \n Thats the way the system works.\n \n As far as Delay goes....First, bassman, if you really think that the Delay prosecution was JUST political, you are absolutly delusional. That scumbag is dirty as hell. \n \n They didn't NEED anything from Delay. The guy is SO ARROGANT that nearly 2/3 of the information they needed to indict him was a matter of public record in the form of campaign funding disclosures. Delay was OPENLY flouting the law and believed he could do so because he was so powerful he was above the law. As things started to fall apart, staffers started turning states evidence and more evidence was coming to light as they uncovered an entire web of corruption.\n \n Delay did not even bother trying to cover up his corruption, or at least he was not bright enough to do it well. He counted on the fact that there were plenty of neo fascists out there such as Bassman that he did not need to bother...he was untouchable. \n \n Bad news for delay and his followers. He is being touched pretty bad.",

DeLay made Jefferson look like an amateur.\n\n \n Jefferson WAS an amateur. Cash payoffs hidden in the freezer? Even I could do better than that. \n \n What is killing Delay is the same thing that is killing \"Kenny Boy\" and that is arrogance. Anybody who includes evidence of corruption in public disclosures is just too smug for his own good. Like Lay, he made only a minor effort to cover up his misdeeds. You and I both know there are a million things Lay could have done to cover his tracks and get off scott free with tens of millions in his pocket. He just didn't bother to do the work because he didn't think he needed to bother. Delay is the same way. Passing bribes to a politician is not a newsworthy event. It is just how business is done. There are dozens of ways that politicians request and accept bribes and nobody ever gets caught becuase the politicians in question work hard to ensure that there is not a major scandal. \n \n Delay didn't even bother going through the motions. No \"charitable organizations\" operated by family members, no sending 50 employees to get their photo taken at $10,000/pop at fundraisers. He dispensed with all the formalities and simply accepted bribes directly. He felt he was so high and mighty he could dispense with the nicities. Again, you know damn well how things like this work, and Delay simply couldn't be bothered.",
