   "Matt Dillon", 
   "I began this book several months ago - I just now saw this forum on works in progress and decided to post it. It is - of course - purely fictional. Any reference to persons living or dead is completely coincidental. . . \n \n Anyhow, I would appreciate any comments on it whatsoever!\n \n Thanks. \n \n And Merry Christmas. \n \n \n Robert Douglas couldn't sleep. Memories of his deceased mother rolled through his head every night. It had come to the point where trying to sleep was sheer and agonizing torture for Robert - torture being a side effect of living. He had gone to all the doctors - even the quacks and witchdoctors, who found absolutely nothing wrong with him. He had - of course - been molested by a Catholic priest when he was 12. However - no shrink, therapist or otherwise self-respecting doctor could see why that incident made trying to sleep - or live, for that matter - unbearable for Robert, who was now 36.\n Robert gazed at the clock - it was now 3:47 am, on September 8, 2008. The date was of no real significance to Robert. He punched his pillow in frustration. His teddy bear lay beside his head, starting mindlessly into space. Robert loved his teddy - being that he had no real friends, his teddy bear gave him a sense of comfort. At least, the bear used to help him feel at ease enough to rest serenely at night. Lately, however - for the past six months or so - absolutely nothing worked to ease his troubled mind - not even the pills he took, the books he read, his teddy bear or the music he meditated to.\n He opened the dresser drawer beside his bed. A fully loaded, semi-automatic pistol lay inside. Pulling it out, Robert turned it over in his hands. He pressed it up against his face, feeling the cool metal massaging his skin. Killing himself seemed very appealing lately. As he was about to pull the trigger, he thought of his mother again. Oh, yes, his mother - the wonderful lady who had died of breast cancer on Christmas day of 2004. That had been the worst day of his life - he had hated Christmas (and Christians, too, for that matter) ever since. Joining his mother in the afterlife - if one did in fact exist - seemed very appealing to Robert. He pulled the trigger - the gun went off, making a loud resounding \"pop\" in the night. Nothing happened, though, except for a temporary loss of hearing in his right ear - the bullet had simply become stuck in the chamber, proving to Robert once again that he truly was living a cursed and horrific existence.\n After his failed suicide attempt, he lay stunned - staring at the shadows on the ceiling for awhile. Aside from a massive headache and a numb feeling in his ear, he was not in the least bit injured. \"Perhaps I should just jump out of the ****ing window,\" he thought to himself (Robert lived in a 21st floor apartment in north Atlanta). \"Knowing me, however, I would probably walk away with just a scrape!\" He laughed out loud and when he finally calmed down, drifted off to sleep for the first time in about two weeks.\n His cell phone woke him up. He glanced at the clock and it said 9:20am - he was almost a half hour late for work. Picking up the phone, he knew from reading the incoming number that it was his boss. Being that Mark Shipheimer was the last person he wanted to talk to, he let the call go into voice mail and turned the phone off. Robert hated Mark so much that he had fleeting thoughts at times of using his pistol on Mark, although he would probably never do so (for various reasons, which he never even shared with his doctors). Of course, Robert couldn't really change jobs - as a still relatively young and inexperienced systems analyst for Koch industries, he knew that the only other jobs available to him if he quit were McDonald's and Quick Trip. Robert turned over in his bed and promptly fell back to sleep. \n The dream was a strange one - he was sitting in a small boat in the middle of an ocean dressed up as Darth Vader. The sky was bright orange and there were poisonous snakes swimming all around him. He kept using his light saber to kill the snakes, only to have more appear. Frustrated, he began to **** off into the water. Once he e*********, the water turned transparent and glasslike and the snakes disappeared. He dove into the water, diving deep within. He could see a mermaid swimming about two hundred yards ahead of him, beckoning him closer. She looked like Angelina Jolie. He started to swim rapidly and caught up to her, only to see her turn into Luke Skywalker. Furiously angry, he pulled out his light saber and promptly cut Luke's head off, only to see the head turn into a huge diamond - which sank to the bottom of the ocean floor and buried itself in the mud. Knowing that he would never recover the treasure, he turned his light saber on himself, cutting his own head off and watching everything go instantly black. . . \n Robert woke up. It was almost 1:00pm and he was drenched in sweat. He arose lazily out of the bed, stretching his arms and legs in the process. After he got dressed and swallowed his anti-psychotic medication, he immediately called his doctor to make an emergency appointment - he thought that he should tell someone about last night's suicide attempt. Also, he needed a doctor's note to once again be let off the hook at work. He knew that Dr. Goodwin might put him in the hospital because of this latest episode, but Robert didn't care. He needed a break from this depressing, pathetic world for awhile. \n Just then, there was a knock at the door. Robert peeked through the peephole - seeing that it was his cousin, Larry Lomax, he let him in. Larry was 42 years old and unemployed. He lived with his mother, paying here rent from his social security benefits. Oh, what a sad case Larry was! He had never held a real job - at least for not longer than 3 months. He was diagnosed schizophrenic, but his real problem seemed to be that he just didn't get along with people. Many times Robert had pondered killing Larry, then himself, to do them both a favor - but had always changed his mind simply because Larry was the closest thing to a real friend that he had and he loved him like a brother. \n \"What's up, dude?\" Larry quipped. Robert loved it when Larry called him dude. It made him feel like a kid again, if only for a brief moment. \"Not much, dude,\" Robert replied. I'm just on my way to see Doc Goodwin. \"What the hell for?\" Larry responded. \"Everyone knows that I'm the real sicko of the family. Humph! By the way, you got something to eat?\" \"Sure, help yourself. In fact, the pad's yours for a couple of weeks. I'm checking myself in to the looney bin. See, I tried to kill myself last night.\" Larry merely blinked at him. \"Well ain't that the God damndest thing! So did I, bro! Would have succeeded, too, if that ****ing dog hadn't barked - waking me up, when I promptly vomited up all those pills I had taken. You got any fried chicken or donuts?\" Larry had opened the refrigerator and now stood there peering anxiously inside. That's what Robert loved about Larry. Unlike himself, Larry had no conscience whatsoever. \"No, but you'll find plenty of leftover pizza. Anyhow, gotta run. Catch you later, dude!\"\n Not looking back, Robert closed the door and stood outside - taking a couple of slow, short breaths. He then got into the elevator and rode it down to the parking garage. His car - a 2004 black Ford Explorer - was waiting for him in its usual parking spot. He got in and sat there for a couple minutes before he broke down in tears. A loud knocking on the car's driver side window snapped him out of it. It was Fred Herndon, the security guard. \"You all right in there, Bob?\" \"Yea, I'm fine, Fred. Why do you ask?\" Fred stood there perplexed, then replied, \"I just wanted to make sure everything was ok.\" \"Yes. Great. Nice weather we're having, isn't it?\" Fred stood there a moment, not sure of what to make of the situation. \"Sure is. You have a nice day, Bob.\" Robert put the car into gear and drove away, waving to Fred, who stood there staring like a XXXXX.\n \"Hmmmm. Very interesting.\" Dr. Goodwin commented after hearing Robert's story. \"What's interesting, Doc - the fact that my inability to sleep is seemingly cured or the fact that I failed miserably at trying to kill myself?\" Robert sat there anxiously waiting, not really liking the doctor's reaction. \"Both, I would have to say. First of all, you couldn't sleep - from my experience, people such as yourself are afraid of something. That fear could be of sleep itself, who knows? Secondly, when you tried to kill yourself and failed, you seemed to develop another greater fear which voided out all your prior fears. Simply put - even though you might not have been trying to, you have probably cured your inability to sleep!\" Robert sat blinking stupidly, not sure of what to say next. That's what he hated about psychiatrists. They seemed to find a positive outcome to any situation - even a failed suicide attempt. \"So you're saying that I don't need to go into the hospital after all?\" \"Absolutely not,\" Goodwin retorted. \"What I think you need is some good old fashioned R&R for a couple of weeks, but not in a hospital. Why don't you take some time off from work and drive up to the mountains and do some writing or something? You might just be surprised what you learn about yourself.\" \n Dr. Goodwin was in his early to mid 60's and an old fashioned type of doctor - for a shrink, that is. He loved to smoke a tobacco pipe while meeting with patients and never prescribed medication except when absolutely necessary. Furthermore, he defied convention - it was not unlike him to invite Robert out for a few holes of golf while conversing about personal issues. He was a proud card carrying Libertarian and had pictures of fish and wild game hung up all around his office. He loved to hunt and even encouraged his patients to do the same - \"very therapeutic,\" as he would say. Robert hated him now.\n \"Let's get one thing straight, doc. I tried to kill myself last night - and nearly succeeded if I don't say so myself - by putting a ####ing gun to my blasted head and pulling the trigger. Now I come to you for help and you say that all I need is a little relaxation for a couple of weeks in North Bone####, Georgia? Quite frankly, doc, I think you're the one who's crazy here. Furthermore, you can go #### yourself!! Hummph!\" Robert sat there with his arms folded, enjoying his momentary feelings of anger and pleasure - pleasure with himself for telling this quack where to go for once. Goodwin simply smiled, which ###### Robert off all the more. \"What's so ####ing funny?\" \"You,\" Goodwin laughed. \"No, Robert, I don't think you need the looney bin at all. In fact, I think you are perfectly sane. Furthermore, since the hospital is what you want, that is the last thing I'd recommend.\" Goodwin no rose out of his easy chair and put his hand on Robert's shoulder. \"Look, kid. If you really want to go into the psycho ward, that is your choice. However, you'll have to volunteer yourself for commitment - I'm not signing any 5150. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more patients to see. Have a great vacation!\" Fuming, Robert got up and walked out - looking back at a happily smiling Goodwin, who waved goodbye. Robert did not wave back.",
