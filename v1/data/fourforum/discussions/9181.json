And if heat continues to be trapped and continues to spread to the countryside, what choice would the countryside have but get warmer?\n \n There is a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. Since most official temperature records (at least in the U. S.) are made in urban settings it is only natural that these records show an upward trend as urban sprawl takes over the areas around the weather stations. For almost 40 years now the official temperature readings for where I live have been taken at the local international airport. But as recently as 20 years ago the airport was still surrounded with woodland and wetland. The area had few buildings or roads or parking lots. But over the past 15-20 years the region has been heavily developed with roads, office parks, warehouses, housing developments and shopping centers. The extra pavement and buildings naturally absorb the sun's heat, thus making the region around the weather station much warmer than it used to be.

Let's apply your logic: If it's warmer in the tropics than at the poles, where can the warmth in the tropics go besides toward the poles? This gradient existed millennia ago, and since this flow of warmth must have existed for as long, the temperature at the poles must be now be near or at that of the tropics.\n Do you see the flaw in your reasoning yet?

Don't throw stones while standing on a glass floor and don't become a self-appointed spelling Nazi. I'm usually a very careful poster that never uses words that i can't spell or define...but I am slightly dyslexic, have big fingers and changing vision.

No harm; no foul.\n \n Also, you come off a little strong in print (much like I do), but you make statements about science that cause me to cringe. There are lots of scientists that post in this forum, yours truly included. While I agree that anthropogenic Global Warming is the equivalent to cold fusion, I came to that conclusion not from a simplistic temperature model but rather based on a better understanding of thermohaline circulation, atmospheric forcing, chemistry and other scientific, as well as political factors. Kyoto is a dog, for example, because it is an environmental scheme to redistribute wealth, not a real attempt to limit CO2 emissions. \n \n I like to debate people on this forum, both formally and casually and will make sarcastic remarks from time to time. But when I make a statement of fact, not opinion, I am careful to have supporting data to back up my claims.

   "I had posted my belief that global warming should be global if it is true- that is temperatures everywhere should go up because trapped heat would eventually be spread out.\nNot exactly. Global warming is global in that weather mechanisms tend to pump heat towards the poles. Hurricanes are huge heat pumps that take heat from the tropics, lift it to extreme altitudes, and move it towards the poles. that's how it is spread out. temperatures in the tropics do not necessarily have to go up since the head pumps move the heat towards the colder regions. In other words, heat is actually spread out - lower latitudes have more severe storms in greater numbers, while the temperatures in the polar regions rise. Thus, as you say, temperatures go up as trapped heat is spread out.\n \n Do you actually ever make any effort to educate yourself before you speak? Do you actually have any concept of the mechanisms that cause weather?",
