   "there are many faiths in this world that are of the view that when you are dead thats it for you until a time when judgement would be passed. but there are thse like Hinduism ad Buddhism that hold the theories of reincarnation: you are not the body but the soul that cannot be destroyed. this soul gose through the cycle of birth and death until it is \"fit\" to attain maosha or merge with the divine being. incoporated in this theory is the laws of KARMA. this is essentially the laws of cause and effect- what you do you will either recieve the rewards or pains for it if not in this life but in another life. it is argued that the laws of Karma is probably flawless. what do you think?\n \n PS< i believe in KARMA and reincarnation.",

   "Re: reincarnation\n \n \nIt is appointed for man to die once - then the Judgment. - Hebrews 9:27\n \n \n Yes, some early Christian wrote this. What's your point, EZ? There are almost a billion people on this planet who embrace the concept of reincarnation, and they are neither ignorant nor are they 'pagans'. The concept of reincarnation makes sense to me, much more sense than the (in my opinion, illogical) Christion belief that a god who loves you is nevertheless prepared to drop-kick your butt into the 'lake-o-fire', where you will spend all eternity, in torment, based on what you did or didn't do over a finite lifetime. In contrast, the Eastern belief is that, if you muck up this life, you get to go around again until you get it right, after which you will obtain union with the divine. \n \n You want 'evidence'? Very well. Man is supposed to be made in the image and likeness of God. Hold that thought for a moment. When my daughter was young, I once asked her to clean up her room. She asserted to me that she would much rather go outside and play. I then explained to her that she could go out and play only after she had cleaned up her room. She pouted, stomped around, and whined until it eventually dawned on her that, if she wanted to go out and play, she would first have to clean up her room. See? This is the type of behaviour I would expect from a parent who loves their child. If, in fact, we are children of God, then I would expect no less from God.",

   "God's Little Troublemakers\n \n Some years back if you'd been watching any sports events on TV, you probably saw this one commercial for Lite beer. And there was this one guy - I think his name was Bob Eucker - who always liked to go up into the stands at baseball and football games and stir up trouble. He'd sit down between two guys who were drinking Lite beer and nudge one of them in the ribs and say something like, \"That guy sitting on the other side of me says that Lite Beer tastes great.\" Well that would get the first guys attention and he'd say, \"Oh yeah?\" Then he'd turn to the other guy and tell him the first guy said that Lite beer is less filling. And that guy would then get up and look at the first guy and yell, \"Tastes great!\" And the other guy would yell back, \"Less filling!\" And the war would be on. The whole stadium would be in an uproar. Then the camera would pan back at Bob Eucker and he would just be sitting back there yucking it up at all the trouble he'd caused.\n \n Well, I'm here today to tell you that God has his own little troublemakers. Wherever the full gospel of Jesus Christ is being preached, God's little troublemakers are at work. Keep that story about Bob Euker in mind as we read from the twenty-third chapter of the Book of Acts:\n \n \"Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin (the members of the Jewish ruling council who were trying to sentence Paul to death) and said, \"My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.\" At this, the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. Then Paul said to Ananias, \"God will strike you - you white-washed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourselves violate the law by commanding that I be struck!\" Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees (who didn't believe in the resurrection and afterlife), and the others Pharisees (who did believe in it), called out in the Sanhedrin, \"My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee, and I stand on trial today because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead.\" When he had said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. And there was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who spoke out who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously.....The dispute became so violent that the Roman commander was afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and rescue him by force, and take him back to the barracks. The council was in an uproar.\" \n \n One of God's little troublemakers had struck! Less filling! Tastes great! That's the kind of thing you sometimes run into when you're preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. \n \n Some years ago, an old English preacher by the name of Smith Wigglesworth once remarked, \"If you leave people as you found them, God is not speaking through you. If you are not making people either mad or glad, there is something wrong with your ministry. If there's not a war going on, you're not doing your job.\"\n \n Another commentator, a guy by the name of Arthur Wallis, speaking on the apostolic style of preaching that we see in the Book of Acts, said, \"Such preaching makes indifference to the word of God impossible - it sets the hearers into one of two camps. It's calculated to either produce a revival or a riot.\"\n \n Whether we like it or not, God's people are sometimes called on to \"rock the boat,\" and to preach a confrontational gospel. And just what is a confrontational gospel? It's any message that preaches the entire gospel of Jesus Christ. It's a message that not only tells the world that Christ is the only way to salvation and eternal life, but it's also a message that confronts unrighteousness, exposes ambivalence, and challenges people to reexamine their lives to see if they have made Christ not only their Savior, but also the Lord of their lives. The Bible doesn't say that Jesus is our Lord or Savior. It says he is our Lord and Savior! And when you acknowledge that and preach his gospel with all the dedication, vigor and passion that you can possibly muster, then you too will have become one of God's \"little troublemakers.\"",

   "Judge Not?\n \n People today are so afraid to speak out on an issue and be labeled as judgmental and intolerant that they're not speaking out at all - they're allowing our nation to be utterly destroyed by all manner of iniquity. \n \n Scripture gives us compelling evidence that Christians are commanded to know how to judge right from wrong, and that we are commanded to confront unrighteousness at every level.\n \n First, God acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge: \n \n Romans 13:1-4 states: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n Second, God commands people to make correct judgments and confront unrighteousness:\n \n In John 7:24, Jesus said: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n In Matthew 18:15-17, Jesus commands us to confront our brother when he sins against us. \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.\" How tolerant is that?\n \n In I Corinthians 5:13 the Apostle Paul is confronted with a man who is having illicit relations with his father's wife. Is Paul going to wallow in tolerance and let Satan destroy the moral fabric of God's blood-bought church? Not hardly. Paul confronts the unrighteous act and tells the deacons of the church: \"God will judge those outside the church. But are you not to judge those inside? Expel the wicked man from amongst you.\"\n \n Third, God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree (person) that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Fourth, the Saints of Christ will one day judge the world, and the demonic angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Finally, when someone accuses you of being judgmental, are they not, according to their own argument, also condemning themselves of being critical and judgmental in making that determination? If we wait for the church to become sinless before we make righteous judgments, what then would this sewer of a world really look like?",

   "Stephen - God's Little \"Troublemaker\"\n \n You may remember another one of God's little troublemakers - Stephen. You see him in Acts chapters six and seven. Stephen was \"a man full of God's grace and power, and he did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.\" But the Bible says that opposition arose against him. Why? Because his message was a threat to the religious establishment of his day - an establishment that rejected Jesus Christ and those who proclaimed his message. Here again was a man who would not compromise God's word for the doctrines of the world. He was wholly and totally committed to God. He was on fire for the Lord. And he was brought into the council of the Sanhedrin to account for his testimony. And I'll read to you what happened next: After a long litany of historic review about the nation of Israel, Stephen looked at the members of the Sanhedrin and cried out,\n \n \"You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears!\n You always resist the Holy Spirit. Was there ever a prophet\n your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who\n predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you\n have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the\n law that was put into effect through angels, but have not\n obeyed it!' When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this\n they were furious, and gnashed their teeth at him. But Stephen,\n full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory\n of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 'Look,'\n he said, 'I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at\n the right hand of God.' At this they covered their ears, and \n yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed him....and\n they dragged him outside the city and stoned him to death.\" \n (Acts 7:51-58)\n \n They were furious! They gnashed their teeth and screamed at the top of their lungs. The council was in an uproar. \n \n One of God's little troublemakers had struck again! So much for \"tolerance.\" And look at what happened when Stephen rebuked those obstinate people for their sins - the Glory of God appeared! Imagine if Stephen were posting here in this forum today and spoke out against the backslidden and the unregenerate, and he said:\n \n \"You stiff-necked and rebellious people - you, who continue to resist the Holy Spirit, reject Jesus Christ, and live for yourselves. What hope can there possibly be for you? When, if ever, are you going to get yourselves right with the Lord?\" How popular would that be? \n \n Why was John the Baptist beheaded? Was he a reed swayed by the breeze of political correctness? Was John one of those guys who wanted everyone to be his buddy? Was he someone who sought after his own well-being and personal indulgences? John the Baptist spoke out strongly against the corrupt religious leaders of his day. He went after King Herod and reminded him of his adultery. He called the Sadducees and Pharisees a \"Brood of Vipers!\" He wasn't playing the world's game and looking out for his own welfare and popularity. He wasn't practicing tolerance and preaching a watered-down gospel that sends people to hell. He was preaching the word of God, trying to turn someone to repentance and salvation, and for that he was labeled a troublemaker and eventually put to death. \n \n Why was Paul beaten and persecuted? Why was James put to death with the sword? Why were the prophets and the apostles martyred? They didn't go after these guys for preaching love and tolerance. They went after them because they also exposed sin, corruption, and idolatry, and took a stand for what's right in the eyes of God. They were God's little troublemakers, and the world couldn't handle it. The world stood convicted of its sin, and in order to justify its own carnal appetite and unrighteousness it chose instead to kill the messengers. Sound familiar?\n \n And herein lies the crux of this message: Exposing sin and confronting apathy and unrighteousness is critically essential to salvation. Without conviction there is no need for a savior. And if the world has no need for a savior, then Jesus' life, death, and resurrection has absolutely no relevance or significance. ",
