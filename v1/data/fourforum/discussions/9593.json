   "Remember a little while ago when the quite conservative governor of the quite conservative Texas, Rick Perry, ordered that school girls receive the vaccine that can prevent cervical cancer? Given that the conservative mantra has been that this will lead to promescuity, most observers were quite confused by this. Now, it makes more sense. According to AP, Merck, the company that makes the vaccine, donated $50,000 to Perry's campaign the same week that he made the decision.\n \n http://keyetv.com/topstories/topstories_story_053053516.html",
