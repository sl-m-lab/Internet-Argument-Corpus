Then the paleontologist gives him the range of dates that most suit his presuppositions.....Then the paleontologists sends in the bone fed-ex, along with a gift-certificate to the finest steakhouse in town and two tickets to the ballgame, and then sits back and waits for the results. Finally, just to be on the safe side, the paleontologist repeats this scenario with at least 2 more labs...this way just in case one doesn't cooperate he has backup and he can pick a date from any number of labs.",

Wanna know how?\n\n \n If you want me to explain to you exactly why he's wrong then go ahead and explain his reasoning. I, along with most of the forum, will gladly shoot him down. \n \n Now, since you answered, I'll keep my end of the bargain. I don't know how much science you know. By your own admission it's not a great deal, so I'll stick to basics. If this is too simplistic just say so. If it seems like I'm skimming over something it isn't because I'm pulling a fast one, I'm just hitting the highlights here.\n \n Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. All atoms with 6 protons are carbon. Most carbon atoms also have 6 neutrons, and we call those atoms carbon 12. But some carbon have 8 neutrons, and we call those carbon 14. I'll abreviate those as C12 and C14 from now on. The important thing about C12 and C14 is that C12 is stable, while C14 isn't. C14 has a half life of 5730 years, which means that if you start with 1 pound of C14, in 5730 years you'll only have 1/2 pound left.\n \n The atmosphere contains carbon in the form of Carbon Dioxide, or C02. Some of that carbon is C12, and some is C14. The ratio of C12 to C14 in the air is pretty much fixed. There's been some variation, but not enough to matter for this level of discussion. When plants grow, they take in CO2 and use it as building material. That means that plants have a set ratio of C12 to C14. Anything that eats the plant will also have that ratio, and anything that eats that animal will too. In other words, pretty much every living thing big enough to see has the same ratio of C12 to C14 as the air does. That is, until they die. Once they die they no longer are replenishing their C14. At that point the fact that C14 decays comes into play. You can measure the ratio of C12 to C14 in a sample of organic matter to great accuracy, and compare it to the ratio that it would have if it were alive. By looking at the difference, and knowing that half the C14 is going away every 5730 years, you can tell how long ago something died. One caveat. The amount of C14 in the air isn't very large, so any given living thing won't have a large amount of it. That means that after about 60,000 years there simply won't be enough C14 in a sample to get an accurate reading, so that's the limit for C14 dating.\n \n So that's it. Nothing but chemistry and math, all well documented. The process is so simple that I can't imagine any way that it could be wrong. So if you can show any way that it could be wrong, other than it disagrees with your beliefs, go ahead and explain.",

However, there are so many cases that don't line up. For example, if we carbon dated some age-known snail shells, we would find that only some (possibly none at all) would CD correctly. Try it.\n \n In regards to the claim that creo scientists tested dates from two animals and called it one, its my website vs. yours. I personally wouldn't trust a site entitled 'talkorigions'.\n \n I liked the water/bucket analogy. There was one problem with their counter-proof: nothing would make the hose switch from a trickle to full blast.\n \n \nNo, he proved that he can manipulate XXXXXX into believing him and then giving him his money which he refuses to pay taxes on. Which is also the reason he's in jail. If you even understood anything about this argument, you'd know why Dr. Dino is a hack.\n\n \n Regardless of his ability to find a loophole in the taxes, his science is quite valid.\n \n \nNot according to what you said before.

No such assumption is made since the \"original content\" isn't even used in the calculations.\n A red herring. There is no evidence to indicate that the decay rate of C14 is any different now than it has been in the past, and in fact, there is considerable evidence that it has remained constant.\n Funny how creationists use such an argument when they have been shown to submit poorly selected or contaminated samples for various kinds of dating. For example, Steve Austin of the ICR once submitted rock samples from the bottom of the Grand Canyon that yielded quite a young age. Of course, it was shown later that the samples were contaminated by modern pollen, a pervasive problem in a world filled with pollen. Real scientists are aware of the problem and make sure that their samples are not contaminated. \n Does that mean the when creationists use carbon-14 dating to date archaeological sites from the Bible that you are claiming that they are wrong?

There was one problem with their counter-proof: nothing would make the hose switch from a trickle to full blast.\n\n Of course you liked the water/bucket analogy; you think that it supports your view. But there is no \"equilibrium\" for decay rates. We've done the tests on an overwhelming number of nuclear reactions, changing everything from pressure and temperature to atmospheric exposure, and the only decay mode affected at all is a tiny, tiny, tiny change in the rate of k-shell capture (under humongous pressures) -- which is not the decay mode of carbon-14.\n The logical consequence of this \"equilibrium\" nonsense means that in space where the count of C-14 is high, the decay rate will be higher. (See LeChatlier's principle.) This is not the case. We have never, ever, ever observed a change in C-14 decay rates, and we've looked really hard.\n In other words, Hovind made it up.\n \n \nLink, please.\n\n You've been given links. Did you follow any of them? Check out Dave Matson's list.\n \n \nRed Herring? There is no evidence that the ratio of C14 has changed in the past.

The simplest method of C14 dating treats the ratio as unchanging, but we do see very subtle changes based on additional dating methods that -- at worst -- throw off \"uncalibrated\" figures by 5%.\n \n \nIt's your word against Hovind's. Oh, and don't forget you're also disagreeing with the Arkansas legislature.\n\n Uh, no. News flash. That bill was sponsored by Jim Holt, an absolute nutjob who has been pushing anti-evolution legislation in the Arkansas legislature for a long time. He was sure that bringing in Hovind would be a slam dunk. Even nutjob Holt was embarrassed at the excrement Hovind presented. The document you cited was merely the bill that Holt introduced.

Have you ever taken a college evolutionary biology course? Hmm? Would you consider your professor an \"expert,\" or would you decide that he was full of bullspit despite his knowledge and training that both dwarf yours into obscurity merely because he didn't stroke your little ego?\n \n \nAtomic theory, you say?
