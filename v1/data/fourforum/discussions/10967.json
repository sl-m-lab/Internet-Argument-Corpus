   "I'd like to submit the following post to see if Dane can prove I was lying. I would like others to join in and judge but please note this is no more than a discussion on whether or not I lied.\n \n Kronus and I have a working definition of what \"lying\" means: A lie is when you post something that you know to be false, untrue, or misleading.\n \n The Claim:\n \n \n\n Your lack of understanding of neurophysiology is not the fault of anybody but yourself. But then I provided you with links that clarified this and you PERSIST in your original, false claims. THAT makes you a LIAR!!!!!\nhttp://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=302513&postcount=252\n \n Background:\n \n Dane and I were having a disagreement about when brain waves start. I posted a link showing where my stance came from and Dane posted a link showing his/her point of view on the subject. I disagreed with this link saying it did not refute my claim. I am still of the opinion that my links are not inaccurate. \n \n It is of my opinion that just because Dane disagrees with does not make me a liar.\n \n I welcome Dane to show where I knowingly posted something that was false, untrue, or misleading or provide any further details he/she feels I left out.\n \n Conclusion:\n \n I would like mainly for Dane to prove this was, in fact, a lie. \n \n Also, it would be nice (but not a point of this forum) for members to provide feedback on whether or not Dane has a good claim in saying I am a liar.\n \n Thank you all.",

   "Ok, here goes. \"Brain waves\" is actually the graphical representation of interactions between neurons in the central nervous system. It's the squiggly lines showing up on EEG's (Electroencephalograms) which pictorially depict the interactions between the different regions of the cortex of the brain (frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal) and between these and other parts of the central nervous system (limbic system, cerebellum, brainstem etc).\n http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003931.htm\n \nBrain cells communicate by producing tiny electrical impulses. In an EEG, electrodes are placed on the scalp over multiple areas of the brain to detect and record patterns of electrical activity and check for abnormalities.\n \n The test is performed by an EEG technician in a specially designed room that may be in your health care provider's office or at a hospital. You will be asked to lie on your back on a table or in a reclining chair.\n \n The technician will apply between 16 and 25 flat metal discs (electrodes) in different positions on your scalp. The discs are held in place with a sticky paste. The electrodes are connected by wires to an amplifier and a recording machine.\n \n The recording machine converts the electrical signals into a series of wavy lines that are drawn onto a moving piece of graph paper. You will need to lie still with your eyes closed because any movement can alter the results.\n \n\n \n \n Now lets look at the claim of your source, a claim you obviously didn't fact check:\n http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/article.cfm/pregnancy_week_8\n \nOne of the most exciting new changes is that the first signs of brain waves can be seen! Nerve fibers are beginning to travel throughout the baby's body.\n\n \n No actual source is provided, of course, and so belies any claim of a scientific foundation for this claim. But they didn't need to. There is no scientifically peer-reviewed source for this claim. Rather, it comes from: Hamlin, H. (1964), \"Life or Death by EEG,\" JAMA, October 12, 113.  This is actually not a research article but rather a lecture about measuring when people have actually died. It was a brief background statement, but not peer-reviewed. he did however base this on research from these guys: Okamoto & Kirikae(1951) \"Electroencephalographic Studies on Brain of Foetus of Children of Premature Birth and New-Born, Together With Note on Reactions of Foetus Brain Upon Drugs\" Folia Psychiat Neurol Jap 1951;5:135-146.  \n \n The research specifically was on hysterotomy abortions where the fetus and uterus was removed intact. And partly, this was done by burying electrodes into the fetal proto-brain. Now, later investigations of this shows no activity at all before 120 days (Niedermeyer & Lopes da Silva (2004). Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields (5th ed). NY: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins) and as such, no verification of the very early research done in 1951 or before.\n \n Likewise, none of this showed any cortical activity, all obtained through stimulation of the brainstem instead as shown in the only other study on fetal brain and proto-brain activities (Bergstrom, R.M. 1986, Development of EEG and Unit Electrical Activity of the Brain during Ontogeny, In L.J. Jilek and T. Stanislaw (Eds.), \"Ontogenesis of the Brain,\" Prague: University of Karlova Press) which found no activity on regular scalp-electrode EEG until the 25th week of gestation (ie 27th week of pregnancy)\n \n And that is where my links come in, showing that the coordinated pattern of activities between the different parts of the central nervous system, patterns that finally indicates any form of processing of stimuli, to not possibly occurring until the end of the 26th week of pregnancy, when the thalamocortical tract finally connects, allowing sensory input to actually reach the brain's cortex where processing occurs.\n \n So no, there are no possible \"brain waves\" before that time.\n \n The links were provided to [EDIT to correct: Steeeve]who ignored the findings and continued to make the same claim. At that point, with the knowledge that it was not correct, [EDIT to correct: Steeeve] did in fact lie.\n \n Case closed.",
