   "  Medical marijuana user may keep her handgun, Oregon Supreme Court rules \n The ruling upholds lower-court decisions that a federal law barring drug addicts from buying firearms does not justify the denial of concealed-weapons permits to people who hold medical marijuana cards.\n \n The Oregon Supreme Court unanimously ruled Thursday that a retired school bus driver can have her medical marijuana and a concealed handgun too.\n \n The ruling upheld previous decisions by the Oregon Court of Appeals and a U.S. circuit court that determined a federal law barring criminals and drug addicts from buying firearms does not excuse sheriffs in two counties from issuing concealed-weapons permits to people who hold medical marijuana cards and otherwise qualify. \n \n \"We hold that the Federal Gun Control Act does not preempt the state's concealed handgun licensing statute and, therefore, the sheriffs must issue (or renew) the requested licenses,\" Chief Justice Paul De Muniz wrote in the ruling issued in Salem. \n \n I often thought that the Antis only reason for wanting medical records in the public domain was so that they would be available for denials of gun purchases, possibly confiscations of guns, and denials of CHL's. \n \n Even if my suspicions were a 1000% correct, this ruling puts the kiabosh on any such ploy. \n \n My only comment was a surprise, Humm.\n \n As you can see, I don't trust Antis any farther than I can through the universe. emoticon_smile Sorry, that is true.\n *****************\n Tither, you must be a delusional paranoid!\n \n No wait. They did try to take away her CHL.\n \n Never mind! emoticon_smile",

   "I would caution against reading too much into this ruling. Although the court says a local sheriff cannot use a federal law's firearm prohibition as grounds to deny a state CCW permit application, the ruling does not in any way prohibit the feds from prosecuting the CCW permit holder for actually possessing the firearm in violation of that federal law. The federal law in question reads, in pertinent part, as follows:\n \n 18 U.S.C. 922\n (g) It shall be unlawful for any person -\n (3) who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802));\n to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n \n The feds can still prosecute her for having or receiving a firearm in violation of this law. Of course, she can claim that she is a \"lawful user\" of marijuana because her state authorizes her use. But to be free of federal prosecution she must show that her \"medical marijuana\" use is considered lawful by the federal government-which may or may not be the case. Therefore, she may very well still be an \"unlawful user\" of a controlled substance as far as the feds are concerned, and if so and if she possesses or receives a firearm then she is in potential danger of being prosecuted by the feds if they can show the necessary interstate commerce connection to the firearm. The risk is slight because the feds rarely trouble with these cases, but the risk is still there.",

   "May 18th.\n   Ranking Member Grassley Presses Holder for Timely Response to Questions, Reiterates Unanswered Requests \n WASHINGTON - Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley is reiterating the need for a timely response from Attorney General Eric Holder to his Questions for the Record for Holder during the Attorney General's May 4th appearance before the Judiciary Committee. \n \n Grassley said he wanted to reiterate his hearing questions for the record in a letter because of the timely nature of his oversight work on Operation Fast and Furious. He said that generally, the Department of Justice takes at least five to eight months to respond to Questions for the Record. Questions for the Record are additional questions to witnesses that appeared before the committee that are not able to be asked during a committee hearing or follow-up questions for the witness based on information provided during the hearing.\n \n \n \"I'll keep pressing for answers from the Attorney General. The oversight work we're doing on the ATF's policy to let guns walk is incredibly important, and these questions should be answered in a timely manner, not the night before the Attorney General comes before the Judiciary Committee the next time,\" Grassley said. \n",
