   "Often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women. Perhaps this should be posted as a poll but I wonder if this support for \"choice\" remains consistent.\n \n Do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children? Do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the women of China for example? The woman's choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her. Do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce China's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children?\n \n There are also some areas in India where a person running for an elected office cannot have more than two children (there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy). Do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice?\n \n Or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples?",

The woman's choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her. Do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce China's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children?\n\n I cannot speak for all pro-choice people, but as for myself, I can say I gladly support a woman's right to her decisions regarding her own offspring and reproductive health. I would not presume to know enough about her situation to add an opinion to that choice, but I will protect her ability to make it to the best of my ability. I am overjoyed when someone I love has a child, and enjoy that child as much as possible when I have a chance. I have a few relatives who have been blessed through means of adoption, and the same goes for them. I also know women who have chosen abortion, and my heart goes out to them.\n \n I think a woman should be free to become a mother if she wants to, but I also think that that decision should be weighed against practical standards. I think its grossly irresponsible for a woman who already has seven children, and is living strictly by the financial aid the government provides, to have another child. (saw this situation firsthand) I also think that if you can't afford to keep your own stomach full, that maybe adding another mouth to the bargain isn't wise. But if you make a ton of money, and your private affairs are in order, I'm not so sure you should feel entitled to having children. I don't think anyone should tell you not to, but I don't think you're naturally entitled to offspring.\n \n In china they have dramatic overpopulation, same goes for India. They have such a problem that it is unfathomable for the typical american to comprehend.\n US- pop. 280,562,489 pop. density 79.6 per sq. mile\n China - pop. 1,286,975,468- pop density- 347 per sq. mile\n India- pop. 1,049,700,118 pop density- 827! per sq. mile.\n \n okay, so (if we were evenly spaced) that gives each American 352 feet in which to breathe. In China, that number is reduced to a mere 80 feet, and in India, one person gets a whole 33 feet all to himself. \n When you think about it that way, would you really want to share your thirty feet with a baby? Even if you did, would it be right to infringe on your neighbor's thirty feet?\n \n\n There are also some areas in India where a person running for an elected office cannot have more than two children (there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy). Do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice?\n \n\n I do not like the idea of the government having too much say in these personal issues... that being said, I don't think it is such a hard thing to ask someone to limit themselves to two children. Certainly in the two most populated countries in the world, they re not in danger of dying out. Sure, some woman might decide its her right to have ten kids, but I think that just might be morally wrong, when we're talking about how many inches to each kid.\n \n\n Or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples?\n\n \n I think that environmental and political concerns should certainly take part in these decisions, though I will not go so far as to assign their importance. Yes, there should be freedom of choice, but should your choices infringe on another's? If we're talking in thirty feetses, sure as heck, i want you to stay out of mine! \n But there are always other circumstances. Should a wealthy landowner deeded with several acres be entitled to have as many kids as his land will support? maybe. Should a wealthy woman with tons of money be able to have as many kids as her pocket will allow? maybe\n But on the other hand, should a poor woman without two red cents to rub together be required to abort her very loved and wanted child? probably not.",

   "What would be some of those negative results?\n\n negative results of pregnancy? Let's see, how about pre-eclampsia, placenta previa, and uncontrollable hemorraging? these are just some of the life-theatening conditions that can and do result from pregnancy. There are also the less dangerous side effects of pregnancy, such as vitamin deficiency, and then of course mental disorders that may result.\n \n \n \n\n Yes, the danger one might encounter to save another's life may be more than the danger encountered to take another's life. \n \n\n In some cases, an abortion is performed in order to save the mother's life. or is her life of no consequence other than as a vessel for a child?\n \n \n\n Why would she need psychological counseling? Do abortion clinics provide this?\n\n I think we are all aware that abortion is a terrible thing. No-one is denying that. And contrary to what some people might think, there is nothing anyone could say to make (most) women undergoing an abortion feel any worse about it. Just like any traumatic situation, sometimes you might just need to talk to someone about it, make sure your head is in the right place. \n And yes, some abortion clinics do provide counseling, but as far as i know, all of them provide referrals to other organizations that do. Contrary to what some people might think, the employees at these clinics, for the most part, are caring, compassionate people.\n \n \n \n\n Do you believe in inalienable rights? Do you believe in the inalienable right to life?\n\n That's a tough question. Yes, I think that in a perfect world this would be true, but as we all know, our world is not perfect. I would prefer that a woman never be faced with a circumstance in which abortion would seem an option than have her not have the option. \n I think I would say that rather than just a simple right to life, that beings have a right to a certain quality of life, that life itself is not enough. As I have said, abortion is never a good thing, but in some cases it might prevent what would be a life of suffering. These are terrible choices to make, but I do not find myself presumptious enough to assume that a child would rather be horribly deformed and retarded than not be at all. Unfortunately, we can't look into the future and ask the kid himself, we have to trust the people involed to make the right decision. \n \n \n \n\n Or by not granting them to the child you are endangering the rights of the child carried by the woman. You are giving her a dictatorship.\n \n\n And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself? I don't think dictatorship is the right word, since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself, and her child. Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support?\n \n Would you rather it be a democracy? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament, we put it to a vote? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate?\n \n \n\n You think \"the unborn child is worthy of protection\"...\"but not more so than the mother, probably less\"...yet you believe \"in most circumstances the child should be carried to term?\"\n\n Yes to both. You see, I am aware that life is complicated and difficult. I am aware that each situation we encounter has it's own aggregates, its own properties. I am not willing to make a drastic- cut in stone- decision regarding something that is so complex.",

And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision.\n \n\n Also, interestingly, there's no man in this 'idealy free' family of yours.\n\n I have no idea where you got this. I have said before, that this decision should be left to the mother, the father (if he is even around) and her doctors. perhaps she would like to talk to a spiritual advisor, or her friends/family. Let me rephrase, the only people who should have a say, aer those the woman wants to include in her decision. Yes, the father should have a say, but he should not be able to force her into carrying the child. Hopefully, the two respect,love and support each other enough to reach the decision together.\n And, for the record, I don't think there is some perfect recipe for a family. Children can be well raised by only their mother, or only their father. (for the record, I know a lot more single fathers than single mothers) Or even another family member.

Some people do not feel it neccessary to see some irrelvant visual image in order to make decisions. \n \n \n\n Who will be the judge of quality of life and suffering? \n\n I certainly think that the family and medical professionals involved in that case is more qualified than some senator.\n \nWho will tell you when you retire and you are no longer \"productive\" that your quality of life is nothing and your life is forfeit to make way for others?\n\n i am not talking about productivity- this child in question will not begin to benefit society for many years, if in fact he/she ever does.\n \n Who will determine that Christopher Reeves cannot live in his broken body because of a poor quality of life?\n\n Mr. Reeve's mind is fully cognizant- and he is fully capable of making that decision for himself.

Just like I trust my family to make this decision should I be horribly injured in some way. i trust my family to make decisions about whether or not I will go on life support, whether I will be a donor, etc. Hopefully they will remember my wishes when we discussed these matters, but in that event, the choice will be theirs. In the case of abortion, it is impossible to make this decision, similar to a person who has not discussed these matters with their family, and they are left to make the decision based upon their own criteria.\n \n Trusting the people involved may not be so wise. After all, it is a decision made in the midst of trauma, confusion, fear, etc. \n trusting some politician may not be so wise either, after all, it is a decison made in the midst of political pressure, irrelevant \"moral\" standards, and even more irrelevant religious beleifs. \n people often have to make choices in a difficult time. This may be unfortunate, but on the other hand, sometimes heartache reveals its own insight.\n \n \n \n\n You are not giving them any rights. You are allowing them to do their job and legislate against inhumane and immoral actions as they do in any other arena.\n\n Humanity and morality are in the eye of the beholder, first of all, and I do not want any politician weighing in with his own standards (which very likely differ from my own)\n \n \n They would be revoking an ability to make a decision as they do in any other action that is deemed detrimental to people and society.\n\n abortion is not detrimental except maybe to the woman involved, it has no effect upon society as a whole.\n \n Actually, you are allowing them to correct the wrong interpretations of the law and the overstepping of the judicial branch that Roe v. Wade created in the first place. \n\n Interpretation of the law is the sole power of the judicial system. It is the responsibility of the legislature to word their laws in such a way that does not allow for \"wrong interpretations\" and I'm sorry, but I will trust the Supreme Court, with their years and years invested into legal experience to make those calls, not you.\n \n\n (Although I believe the legislature has the power to do this, I believe that it would be more proper and practical for a change in abortion to occur at the grassroots level. That change will not occur by promoting \"choice\" and \"reproductive freedom\").\n \n\n that is your opinion- you are welcome to it, no matter how much I may disagree.\n \n \n\n \"choice\" = tyranny\n \n\n Boy, \"pro-life\" advocates sure are fond of powerful words. tyranny, dictatorship, genocide, murder, morality....\n people use these words like a copywriter, trying to inspire people to buy their line. I'm sorry, but I do own a dictionary, and a fairly good grasp of vocabulary, and the subtle connotations attached to using powerful words. Unfortunately, you don't get to redefine words as you like. Tyranny is actually better equated with the revocation of choice.\n \n \n \n\n Yes, complicated and difficult.

   "What is \"sick\" and \"absurd\" about showing a mother a picture of her baby?\n\n \n Because they are not going to be a mother and they do not have a baby yet. Furthermore, and more importantly, the only reason you suggest showing this image to pregnant women is to guilt them into making a decision you prefer. They have to make a hard enough choice already. Superbuddhaman has already given similar analogies.\n \n \nI do believe that a mother in the fullest sense of the word should do everything in her power to protect her child--even risking her life.\n\n \n What good is she to her child though if she is dead? In almost any emergency situation involving an adult and a child if the adult does not protect themselves first both will die. For example, if an airplane is swiftly losing altitude, and the oxygen masks drop, an adult must give themselves oxygen first, then to the child. Despite our best intentions, if we forget to care for the care-givers, they will not be able to care for the children.\n \n \n\"choice\" = tyranny\n\n \n Argumentum ad populum. This isn't an assertion- it's a bumper-sticker.\n \n \nBut I am willing to make a drastic-cut in stone-statement, if it will save a child.\n\n \n I'm sure you're willing to do many, many things in an attempt to \"save\" unborn progeny. What strikes me as inconsistent about your presentation of your beliefs is that despite your assertion that this is about \"life\" and \"children\", you don't seem to be concerned about the lives and sufferings of all the born children in the world. Such as the millions of Iraqi children having to die/starve/suffer with gov't decisions I don't see you opposing.",

   "Superbuddha,\n \nThat is your definition of a mother. \n \n What's your definition of a mother?\n \n \nI can take you anywhere onthe planet and show you mothers who are not protecting and caring for their children.\n\n Of course you can. They're not really being good mothers are they?\n \n \nI do not believe a woman should become a mother until she makes a conscious decision to do so to the best of her ability. I do not think that anyone should be forced into lifelong repercussions of a simple act through the opinions of some politician.\n\n If you don't think a woman should become a mother until she makes a \"conscious decision\" to do so don't you think you should be arguing for abstinence? Arguing for abortion is arguing that a woman should not have to be a mother after she has already become one. \n \n Having sex with someone knowing the possible fruits of the act is not a conscious decision? I don't think that the opinions of a politician are the cause of pregnancy.\n \n \nAs Mizmax said, this is not neccessary in order to make a choice. I do not need to see pictures of cat's dead baby inside her to know that unless it is removed, she will die from toxic shock. A CF patient does not need to see pictures of his lungs to know they are full of fluid, and does not need to go to school on the subject in order to decide to sign a DNR.\n\n I'm not sure what a dead cat baby has to do with a live human baby (I'm not talking about a dead baby). I don't think that fluid filled lungs compare to a baby either. \n \n I posted this on another thread concerning \"choice\":\n \n George McKenna wrote this in an article titled \"On Abortion: A Lincolnian Position,\"\n \n \"In all these [presidential speeches and Lincoln Douglas debates] he [Lincoln] continually reminded his audience that the theme of choice without reference to the object of choice was morally empty.\" (emphasis mine)\n \n Lincoln was speaking to Douglas' reference to the \"freedom of choice\" of slavery. The article, a comparison of slavery and abortion, can be read here:\n \n http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/9...on/abortion.htm \n \n \nThat is a silly idea brought about by people who think that women who have abortions are ignorant that they are carrying a child- or what that child looks like. It is not neccessary, but if a woman wants an untrasound, she can have one. Some people do not feel it neccessary to see some irrelvant visual image in order to make decisions. \n \n \n \"irrelevant visual image\"???\n \n \nabortion is not detrimental except maybe to the woman involved, it has no effect upon society as a whole.\n\n \n I think that is debatable. I think it has a detrimental effect on the child involved. It also very strongly affects society--it promotes a view that lessens the value of life. This can permeate into society in many different forms. It also decreases the number of births. Almost all countries in the west are suffering due to that. We are aging and no one will be here to care for us.\n \n \nInterpretation of the law is the sole power of the judicial system. It is the responsibility of the legislature to word their laws in such a way that does not allow for \"wrong interpretations\" and I'm sorry, but I will trust the Supreme Court, with their years and years invested into legal experience to make those calls, not you.\n\n \n Well, I'm not a lawyer so I would have to yield. But there are many lawyers and judges out there that can and do argue the position I presented using their many years of legal experience. \n \n \nBoy, \"pro-life\" advocates sure are fond of powerful words. tyranny, dictatorship, genocide, murder, morality....\n people use these words like a copywriter, trying to inspire people to buy their line. I'm sorry, but I do own a dictionary, and a fairly good grasp of vocabulary, and the subtle connotations attached to using powerful words. Unfortunately, you don't get to redefine words as you like. Tyranny is actually better equated with the revocation of choice.\n\n \n Yes, I do use powerful words for a powerful subject. It is a debate tool. Do not think I would attack someone in person with rhetoric though. I am debating an issue here with no faces attached. And don't act like the pro-life side is the only one that does it. We do need to move past words at some point and face real experiences. Tyranny is actually better equated with the revocation of choice? Do you think that the mother is revoking her child's choice?\n \n \nEven if that child is destined to a life of suffering?\n\n \n Who is going to predict this with certainty?\n \n \nEven if the mother is destined for a life of poverty, distress, and substance abuse?\n \n \n Poverty? Do buddhists measure life by material goods?\n \n distress? Don't we all experience distress?\n \n substance abuse? I think that's the mom's problem that she needs to find help with. The child does not need to be punished for the mom's addiction.\n \n \nEven if medical technology has no way to save that child from suffering? Even if it will die much more painfully and much more aware very soon anyway? \n \n \n I know that the medical field makes mistakes in prognoses all of the time. \n \n \nDo you somehow think that you are better equipped with making a decision for me? \n \n \n Not necessarily, that's why we are discussing the issue.\n \n \nDo you have enough faith in the system to ensure that that child does not endure undue hardhips?\n\n \n child enduring undue hardships or no child? hmmm",

   "Superbuddha,\n \n What's your definition of a mother?\n\n my definition of a mother is irrelevant- we are talking about rights of a woman who does not want to be a mother.\n \n \n\n Of course you can. They're not really being good mothers are they?\n \n\n that is not the point. Seems you would rather a world full of bad mothers than happy women.\n \n\n If you don't think a woman should become a mother until she makes a \"conscious decision\" to do so don't you think you should be arguing for abstinence? Arguing for abortion is arguing that a woman should not have to be a mother after she has already become one. \n \n Yes, abstinence is the best policy...but it is not always the case. Birth control should be used, but sometimes it fails- or the woman fails to follow directions. i don't think a woman should be sentenced to becoming a mother if she makes one mistake. Sentencing a woman to spending the rest of her life attached to a child she does not want is cruel, both to her and in many cases, to the child. And of course there are those troublesome cases of rape and incest- should a woman be sentenced to a punishment for the crime she was a victim to?\n \n\n Having sex with someone knowing the possible fruits of the act is not a conscious decision? I don't think that the opinions of a politician are the cause of pregnancy.\n \n\n You may be the most calm and composed person under pressure, and you may not be swayed by what people who understand sexuality call \"the heat of the moment\" but not all people are like that. Having sex is something that takes, under the best circumstances, a few hours at the most, and it should not be punishable with a minimum sentence of 18 years. I'm very happy for you that you never do something you regret later, that you always fully consider every possible outcome of every possible situation, but not all of us are so lucky.\n No, politicians do not cause pregnancy. But they are trying to control every other aspect of a sexual relationship, down to the legal definition of said relationship. \n [quote]\n \n \n \n\n \"irrelevant visual image\"???\n \n\n yes, seeing a visual image of a fetus a woman has decided to terminate is irrelevant to the procedure, and to the decision itself. Showing this picture to the woman would be similar to showing pictures of every single person who died to the pilot who participated in a bombing mission. Or better yet, showing them to the commanding officer, or to the president himself. At some point someone decided that these people had to die in order to achive whatever goal they wanted. Should they be tortured with the images of the unfortunate victims of their decisons? Decisions that were made ideally with their own best interests in mind?\n \n \n\n I think that is debatable. I think it has a detrimental effect on the child involved. It also very strongly affects society--it promotes a view that lessens the value of life. This can permeate into society in many different forms. It also decreases the number of births. Almost all countries in the west are suffering due to that. \n \n\n it promotes a view, that in your opinion lessens the value of life. My opinion, on the otherhand, is that it may promote the value of life in deeper ways.\n I do not think that we are suffering at all. There is a very healthy birthrate in this country. \n This next bit is officially the worst argument I have ever heard againt abortion.\n \nWe are aging and no one will be here to care for us\n\n \n If you are so upset about abortion because you think that the fetuses in question might grow up to wipe your drool, that sounds mighty self-involved. It is up to each person who decides that they do want to be a parent to instill in their children the kind of values that will make those kids care about the elderly. It is also (i believe) the responsibility of the government to make sure you have a dry chin, not to a 16 year old girl with enough on her mind.\n \n \n\n \n Yes, I do use powerful words for a powerful subject. It is a debate tool. Do not think I would attack someone in person with rhetoric though. I am debating an issue here with no faces attached.\n\n So you are saying that is is okay to use rhetoric on this forum? and that you are doing so? thanks for justifying my opinion.\n \n And don't act like the pro-life side is the only one that does it. We do need to move past words at some point and face real experiences.\n\n I don't think you should be able to determine what experiences a total stranger should have.\n [quote]Do you think that the mother is revoking her child's choice?No- I don't. She is revoking his life. terminating it. She is preventing any choice to ever be made by that fetus. That fetus, by the way, will not be capable of any life-or-death decisions for many years to come anyway. \n \n \n \n\n Who is going to predict this with certainty?\n \n\n Until you can prevent it with certainty, the mother gets to try. Of course, no mother can predict anything with any certainty.\n \n \n\n Poverty? Do buddhists measure life by material goods?\n \n\n not everyone is buddhist- i don't expect anyone else to adhere to my standards.\n \n\n distress?

   "Why would an ultrasound cause stress or be like torture?\n\n \n Well sometimes it is when you see an ultrasound and you see your baby's face and see the heart beating and then you see the doctors point out where your baby is missing crucial parts of its heart and brain and all its other organs and hands and feet and spine and its intestines are outside of its body and in the umilical cord instead of being where they are supposed to, and then they turn around and tell you that your baby is dying right as you are looking at it and I don't even think stressful justifies that because you wish to God there was something you can do but it's there dying inside of you and there isn't a XXXXXXn thing you can do about it, and THEN to be told by 4 different doctors that the best thing you can do is terminate the pregnancy now before things get worse because there is no chance of survival for the baby, and prolonging it any further is going to cause the baby to eventually be in extreme pain, and that the mass that they saw on the umbilical cord could rupture at any time and kill you along with the baby, but you need to make a quick choice and decide what you are going to do, preferably within the next week, even though you finally got pregnant after trying for a year, yeah I think I would put that right up there with torture.

   "Buddha,\n \nmy definition of a mother is irrelevant- we are talking about rights of a woman who does not want to be a mother.\n\n the \"rights\" of a mother who does not want to be a mother might be more accurate\n \n \nthat is not the point. Seems you would rather a world full of bad mothers than happy women.\n \n No, I would rather see a world of good mothers but also a world where women realized that abortion won't be their ticket to happiness.\n \n \nYes, abstinence is the best policy...but it is not always the case. Birth control should be used, but sometimes it fails- or the woman fails to follow directions. i don't think a woman should be sentenced to becoming a mother if she makes one mistake. Sentencing a woman to spending the rest of her life attached to a child she does not want is cruel, both to her and in many cases, to the child. And of course there are those troublesome cases of rape and incest- should a woman be sentenced to a punishment for the crime she was a victim to?\n\n I'm not sure how the philosophy of the world got so twisted as to declare motherhood a \"sentence\" as if it was a crime. Sentencing the mother? What is the child sentenced to? Where is the fault of the child in rape and incest?\n \n \nYou may be the most calm and composed person under pressure, and you may not be swayed by what people who understand sexuality call \"the heat of the moment\" but not all people are like that. Having sex is something that takes, under the best circumstances, a few hours at the most, and it should not be punishable with a minimum sentence of 18 years. I'm very happy for you that you never do something you regret later, that you always fully consider every possible outcome of every possible situation, but not all of us are so lucky.\n\n No punishment, just responsibility. Parents should be very active in talking to their children about sex and its results.\n \n \nNo, politicians do not cause pregnancy. But they are trying to control every other aspect of a sexual relationship, down to the legal definition of said relationship. \n \n That may be another topic. But a politician's legislation on abortion has nothing to do with a sexual relationship. It has to do with protecting a child.\n \n \n \nIf you are so upset about abortion because you think that the fetuses in question might grow up to wipe your drool, that sounds mighty self-involved. It is up to each person who decides that they do want to be a parent to instill in their children the kind of values that will make those kids care about the elderly. It is also (i believe) the responsibility of the government to make sure you have a dry chin, not to a 16 year old girl with enough on her mind.\n\n I did not state it as an argument against abortion. I stated it as an effect of abortion. Yeah, that's my real motive. I want someone to wipe my drool. That's why I spent all this time here. Watch out with those powerful words like drool.\n \n \nSo you are saying that is is okay to use rhetoric on this forum? and that you are doing so? thanks for justifying my opinion.\n\n It depends on what definition of rhetoric you mean...effective speech...or ostentatious language and words?? I was trying to convey that the approach in a debate may be different than the communication in a one on one personal interaction. Does your drool speech not qualify as rhetoric?\n \n \nDo you think that the mother is revoking her child's choice?\nNo- I don't. She is revoking his life. terminating it. She is preventing any choice to ever be made by that fetus. That fetus, by the way, will not be capable of any life-or-death decisions for many years to come anyway.\n \n Oh, she's not revoking his choice, just his life? That's much easier to take.\n \n \nnot everyone is buddhist- i don't expect anyone else to adhere to my standards.\n\n But which do you think is better? Should we try to end poverty by ending lives or should we try to enrich lives by ending poverty?\n \n \nof course we do... the key is try and prevent as much distress as possible\n Funny how someone can sit comfortably in their chair in front of their nifty computer and pass judgement on someone else. \n \n Pass judgment? Give me a break. I haven't passed any more judgment on her than you have. Look at what you wrote next:\n \n \nYes, she needs to get off drugs- but that's not the point\n, \n \n \nshould a woman who is not capable or willing to do so before she got pregnant be forced to endure the shame and pain of delivering a addicted child with numerous health problems? \n \n Shame of delivering an addicted baby? Are you judging her and saying she should feel shame for this? Yes, she should bear the responsibility for her actions. Should the baby be punished for something that she did not do? I think you asked that question about the mother above.\n \n \nA child that the sytem will automatically take and then have off no hope or help to? Should my tax dollars be taken to care for this poor sick child that has no chance of a \"normal life\"?\n\n No hope? No chance of a normal life?

If a person is not ready to get clean- they're not going to, not matter how much they might want or need to. Addicts will place their addiction far above any other concerns, including pregnancy. Why does the world need more of these tragic cases? Sure, there might just be a miracle... but they call it a miracle because it is so unlikely to happen. I'm sorry, but the idea of a life of agony in the hopes of a miracle seems kinda tragic to me.

But many drug addicts do not think that way. They do not value life the way an expectant mother should. I don't hate drug addicts. I respect greatly those who can extricate themselves from this terrrible lifestyle.

   "Often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women. Perhaps this should be posted as a poll but I wonder if this support for \"choice\" remains consistent.\n \n Do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children? Do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the women of China for example? The woman's choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her. Do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce China's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children?\n \n There are also some areas in India where a person running for an elected office cannot have more than two children (there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy). Do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice?\n \n Or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples?\n\n \n Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I support any choice that the woman wants to make. No, I don't support forced abortions anywhere, I don't support what's going on in China and India because they're still taking a choice away from the women.\n What I don't get is that many prolifers think that prochoicers are ONLY for the choice of abortion. All the prochoicers I know support any choice the woman feels right about making. For example, I was called a hypocrite because I'm prochoice and pregnant. The person said \"You're forcing others to abort while you carry to term.\" I have NEVER forced anyone to do anything, nor will I ever. I've also never aborted...and many prolifers automatically assume that if one is prochoice they've aborted.",
