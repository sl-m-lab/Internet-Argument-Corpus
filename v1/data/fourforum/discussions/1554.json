   "Note1: Some Possible Question for Discussion or addressing in your\n Replies include any of the following questions.Questions for\n discussion are below. \n \n NOTE2: The primary focus of this post is not about either Sharon's Wall, \n nor the New racist Marraige Law. \n \n The primary concern of this thread will be found be found by\n the post.\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Israel once claimed all it's citizens had equal rights, and that it's Arab Citizens were not 2nd Class Citizens. \n \n Although I was never so naive to believe that equalizing statements written ino Israeli Law, were in fact, fiarly practiced. \n \n Just as the NAZI's initially had Marriage Laws to prevent mixing of the races and ethnic groups, so too has Israel has enacted a Marriage Law to begin cleansing that State of it 2nd Class Arab Citizens that have married Arabs that are not Israeli Citizens. \n \n In short, the new Marriage Law effectively prevents any Israeli-Arab from marrying an Arab that is not an Israel citizen. \n \n The punishment for the crime is: expulsion of the Married couple from Israel and atherfore away from either the Groom's or Brides Families. \n \n The reasoning behind the Israeli Right-Wing controlled government's decision to enact the racist Marriage Law to Expel it's Arab Citizens is clearly a rather lame attempt to reduce its Arab-Israeli population growth, and ensure the State is more \"Jewrish\". - (The reasoning behind such thinking escapes me.) \n \n It is not unreasonable to wonder when Israel may create additional racist laws against its child bearing Arab Citizens to restrict the permitted number of children to one per family, or perhaps to provide some economic incentive with the hope that it's Arab Citizens voluntarily submit to submit be sterilization. (The ultimate travesty I can think of.)\n \n As A People that have extensively examined, and studied persecution in NAZI Germany, and the roots of anti-Semitism World-wide , I expected better from the State of Israel. \n \n If continued recist moves are made along Israel's current path, or to measures are put into Israeli Law that would deny tis Arab Citizens \n \"!Man 1 Vote\", of to expel all iits Arab citizens and live as an eithnically pure State, I will find no reason to think of Israel as any differnt than \n a NAZI State that is no different that the post-Islamic Revolution Iran. \n ======================================== \n ======================================== \n The gravity of the situation can be more fully understood when it is explained that the growth rates of the Arab-Israeli populations within Israel during the next 20 tears will mean that Arab-Israeli's will exceed the Jewish population in Isreal within the next 20 years! And within 40 years from now, the of geometric grownth of the Muslism population in Israel will dwarf the number of Jews in Israel.\n ===========================================\n THIS IS THE MAJOR CRISIS FACING ISRAEL TODAY! No land sqabbles or discussions about Jerusalem compare the the importance of this impending issue facing both Israelis and Arab Israelis.\n \n This is issue raises concerns about the viability of the Israali State, and the morality, ehtics, and judgement of all Israeli Citizens.\n ======================================== \n ======================================== \n \n Probems with any racists laws and other forms of unequal treatment such things unequal allocation of government funding to Jews and Arab Israelis in the mist basic things, such as education.\n \n It would be hard to imagine that such despareties in giverment specnding would not be tolerate for much longer that 10 to 12 years from now. \n \n ============================================= \n ============================================= \n HERE ARE SOME POSSIBLE QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT WANT \n TO COMMENT ABOUT IN YOUR YOUR REPLIES: \n ============================================= \n ============================================= \n 1) WHAT SCENARIOUS DO YOU THINK ARE POSSIBLE??? \n 2) WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WILL HAPPEN???? \n 3) WHAT SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WOULD YOU CJHOOSE??? \n 4) HOW MIGHT YOU GO ABOUT SOLVING THE PROBLEM???\n _________________",

   "If a country democratically chooses a what some call 'racist' policies, then who is to blame? General public sentiment? I assume treat2 is a liberal, the whole bit about racism really makes him mad.\n \n What would the true liberal think though? The liberal ideal is acceptance, tolerance of everything. Therefore, if a country democratically elects to have a racist policy, it should be tolerated. The public has reflected their views upon legislation. If they want to have the law, that is their business. \n \n Now, by wanting to change this overt act of racist legislation, you go against another liberal thought line. You, in fact, turn totalitarion to a point. You, from another country, wish to force your views and moral value upon their laws and public ideals. Is that not totalitarian in some aspects?\n \n Please, lets find real solutions!",

   "Israel is afraid of more Arabs gaining citizenship and moving in. There are no racist motives here, that's it. 20% of Israelis are already Arabs.\n \n I don't think it's the right policy though. Maybe they should consider changing how you get citizenship instead.",

   "Just as the NAZI's initially had Marriage Laws to prevent mixing of the races and ethnic groups, so too has Israel has enacted a Marriage Law to begin cleansing that State of it 2nd Class Arab Citizens that have married Arabs that are not Israeli Citizens.\n Nazi tactics? Gimme a break. It appears you have no first-hand knowledge of the Israeli law or you wouldn't make such a comparison.\n \n To prove my point, I ask that you provide readers with a pertinent summary of the two measures implemented by Germany that have come to be known as the Nuremburg Laws. Then I ask that you also provide the relevant verbiage of the Israeli law. Finally, I challenge you to find any parallels between the two. This should be a simple task, assuming you know what you're talking about. \n \n After all, no one twisted your arm to initate this discussion, including the Not-see reference in your topic heading. So it is clear you bear the most responsibility for providing real facts as a basis for further discussion. But don't sweat it, I'll help you along.\n \n The Avalon Project at Yale Law School is a good place to look for historical legal documents. The first measure enacted in Sept 1935 is called \"The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor\" and is found here. \n \n \n The second measure, called \"The Reich Citizenship Law,\" is found here. \n \n Now that you have the German laws in hand, pick out the provisions that are parallel to the Israeli law.\n \n No doubt you have read the Israeli law, else how could make the following statements?\n \n \nIn short, the new Marriage Law effectively prevents any Israeli-Arab from marrying an Arab that is not an Israel citizen. \n \n The punishment for the crime is: expulsion of the Married couple from Israel and atherfore away from either the Groom's or Brides Families.\n\n Of course the problem I have with your assessment is that it does not match any provisions that are actully written into the law. So I ask, exactly which section and paragragh numbers in the Israeli law do you find to support your assertions?\n \n Do you even know the name of the law. Yes, I see you refer to it as the 'Marriage Law,' but anyone who has read the legislation know that is not the name.\n \n Let me suggest something radical: Provide a reference or link to the actual source you used to inform yourself about this new Israeli law. Yes, that will surely be telling. \n \n \n \nThe reasoning behind the Israeli Right-Wing controlled government's decision to enact the racist Marriage Law to Expel it's Arab Citizens is clearly a rather lame attempt to reduce its Arab-Israeli population growth\n Frankly, what is 'lame' is your presumptiousness to think you know what you're talking about when you and I both know you have in fact never even read the law.\n \n See if you can find out the name of the law, then look it up online and read its provisions. Perhaps then you may be ready to discuss the law intelligently instead of sounding like someone who has been spoon-fed some racist propaganda only to regurgitate it in a public forum.",

   "I don't think it's the right policy though. Maybe they should consider changing how you get citizenship instead.\n\n \n I agree that the law needs more work. It's already being challenged in its present form in a petition to Israel's High Court. In a sense it is a citizenship law having as much or more to do with nationality than marriage. In fact, the word marriage is not mentioned even once throughout the entire piece of legislation.\n \n It's worth noting that with the signing of the 1993 Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO, Israel became extremely accommodating to non-Israeli Arabs who married Israeli citizens. Approximately 100,000 Palestinians happily moved into Israel after marrying Israeli-Arabs. With the outbreak of violence in Sept 2000, the automatic granting of citizenship or even residency permits became a problem. There have been some twenty lethal attacks in the last few years involving Palestinians who gained entry to Israel through marriage.\n \n For the record, the law is written as a temporary measure and will expire after one year. Israel is seeking alternative measures to deal with the legitimate security issues that prompted the legislation.",
