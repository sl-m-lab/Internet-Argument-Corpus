   "Well, from what I read from here:\n \n FAQ Proportional Representation \n \n It seems like this style of voting is quite popular internationally.\n \n There's many types out there: Party List System,Mixed Member Systems, Preference Voting (also known as Single Transferable Vote), Cumulative Voting, Limited Voting, and Majority Preference Voting.\n \n The party list system seems the most favorable. The list of nations that have it.\n \n \n ALGERIA, ANGOLA, ARGENTINA, AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, BENIN, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, BRAZIL, BULGARIA, BURKINA FASO, BURUNDI, CAMBODIA, CAPE VERDE, CHILE, COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, CYPRUS, CZECH REPUBLIC, DENMARK, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, EL SALVADOR, EQUATORIAL GUINEA, ERITREA, ESTONIA, FINLAND, GREECE, GUINEA-BISSAU, GUYANA, ICELAND, INDONESIA, ISRAEL, LATVIA, LIBERIA, LIECHTENSTEIN, LUXEMBOURG, MOLDOVA, REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE, NAMIBIA, NETHERLANDS, NETHERLANDS ANTILLES, NEW CALEDONIA, NICARAGUA, NORWAY, PARAGUAY, PERU, POLAND, PORTUGAL, ROMANIA, SAN MARINO, SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE, SLOVAKIA, SLOVENIA, SOUTH AFRICA, SPAIN, SRI LANKA, SURINAME, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND, THE STATE UNION OF SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO, TURKEY, URUGUAY, WALLIS AND FUTUNA\n \n \n They say the advantages are these:\n \n # There is much greater voter participation. In countries using PR, voter turnout is usually in the 70% to 95% range.\n \n # Campaigns tend to be issue oriented rather than popularity contests. Because American society is so diverse, it is difficult to find issues that will guarantee majority support. Instead, campaign managers fight to attract swing voters who are not attracted to either candidate. They have discovered the most effective way to do this is by smearing the opponent. Swing voters are more influenced by negative campaigns because they are unattracted to the positive positions of either candidate. Under PR, however, a majority is not required to get elected. Instead politicians run campaigns directed at a particular constituency and the most effective campaigns are issue oriented.\n \n # Minorities and woman get much greater representation under proportional representation. Women in countries using PR generally comprise somewhere in the range of 25% - 35% of elected officials, as opposed to less than 5% here in the U.S. PR has been used in Voting Rights Act cases where it has been shown that gerymandered districts or the use of at-large representation has denied minorities fair representation. PR has proven to be an effective way of ensuring minority representation in Alamagordo, NM and Peoria, IL. Blacks have been continuously represented on the city council and school committee of Cambridge, MA since it instituted its version of PR in 1941.\n \n # There is a much greater selection under proportional representation. Americans come in more than two flavors. There is no way that two political parties can represent the diversity of opinion that exists in this country. Under PR the size of the vote determines the size of the representation, but everyone gets represented.",

However, countries with winner-take-all systems end up like this:\n \n Rule of the Winner-Take-All System: Whichever candidate has the plurality wins the seat (in a single-seat congressional district.)\n \n Hypothetical Scenario: \n In one district, there are three parties: Conservative, Liberal, and Green.\n \n In the first election, C gets 40% of the vote, L gets 36% of the vote, and G gets 24%. The single seat of the district goes to the Conservatives, thus, 40% vote leads to 100% representation (for that district.)\n \n Since Liberals and Greens hold somewhat similar views, they decide to unite into one party, the Griberals, for the next election.\n \n The votes come out like this: Conservative - 40%, Griberal - 60% The Griberals win the seat.\n \n In the next election, the Conservatives decide to jump on the moderate bandwagon. Since the Griberals stand on the left, and the Conservatives stand in the center, the Conservatives win the center and right wing votes while the Griberals are stuck with only the leftist votes. The votes come out like this: C-70%, G-30%\n \n In order to compete in the next election, the Griberals move more towards the center as well. This removes the Conservative monopoly of the moderates, yet both parties end up resembling each other. Yet although their views have become similar, they have no reason to merge, for the system does not reward a party for exceeding 50% of the vote.\n \n American politics has followed a similar course, all because of our junky voting system. Now we are stuck with two indistinguashable parties.\n \n Conversely, let's take the same scenario, but use proportional representation instead. The district is larger now, and has 5 seats up for grabs. There are still three parties: Conservatives, Liberals, and Greens.\n \n The votes come out like this: C-40%, L-36%, and G-24%\n Each party wins representation: C-2 seats, L-2 seats, and G-1 seat.\n \n The parties, therefore, see no need to merge for the next election. For if, say, the Greens and Liberals merged, they would end up with 60% of the vote and 3 seats - which is the same total as if the parties were divided.",
