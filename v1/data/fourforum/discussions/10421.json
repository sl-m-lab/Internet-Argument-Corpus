The cause of disease has nothing to do with the genes themselves...as Dr. Bruce Lipton says, \"It's the environment, stupid.\" Of course if this little secret got out (that people could cure themselves by changing their internal and/or external environments) then Big medicine, including millions and millions of people would be without a paycheck. We can't have that. The sad thing though, as your article indicates, is disease doesn't just end with the person who has it...diseases often get carried forward into future generations, making children (and their children) more vulnerable.",

Nearly all are due to either inheriting a set of predisposing genes or to chemical interference with normal genes, or to mutangenic effects of radiation and chemicals. The degree to which man made mutagens causes cancer is not entirely clear except in special cases like vinyl chloride, benzene, and tobacco smoke among others. Environmental controls can only provide some degree of prevention, they cannot cure cancer after its established. Mostly thats done by immune system action - we all get cancer rather often in fact, but it gets killed off before it becomes a problem. That system is of course not perfect and people do often develop serious problems with cancer. The simplest public health improvement would be to eliminate the habit of smoking cigarettes - speaking of billions and billions of dollars! {and I am not even taking heart disease and possibly AZD into account}. By the way we appear to have a good handle on stopping cervical cancer cold in its tracks via vaccination against the relevant viruses.",

Just because science has said for decades that cancer is caused from a random mutation doesn't make it necessarily true. I won't post it again, but it has recently been discovered that epigenetic change happen before the cancer mutation takes place. This is a pretty good indication that the mutation has a cause besides bad luck.",

Science has also pointed out that dietary factors or pollutants can cause random mutations. There are also many other causes of cancer, including some viruses. In any case, contributions to oncogenesis by epigenetic factors does not mean that mutations do not cause cancer, nor does it mean that evolution isn't dependent on mutation -- meaning in its broadest sense changes to the arrangement of the genome.\n \n Sorry, but the study of epigenetics has not so far found anything to cause us to doubt the central role of natural selection of hereditary variants in evolution.",

High carb diets probably not - high fat yes esp colon cancer {so we think}, low-nutirition does not mean much so I wont respond, as I said some environmental mutagens man-made and otherwise, mental health? I don't know of any direct link to cancer for that. Environmental \"toxins\" are often carcinogenic because they induce mutations for most practical purposes random ones. Smoking is much the same. And many cancers are literally the result of bad luck - a passing cosmic ray for example. I would also add that many cancers also require more than a single mutation and two hits or more are required to produce the disease. Epigentic effects are of course another form of mutation.",
