   "What do you think of the music that is really popular with teens?\n\n \n The same thing my dad thought about my music when I was a teen; NOT MUCH! I just have a more open mind than he did as I allow it to be played in my car, where as he wouldn't allow it in his. \n \n I was such a brat though, I got revenge on him. I used to go out to his Lincoln, turn the stereo to WBCN Rock in Boston, crank it up, and turn on every other feature that car had as high as it would go, so when he started the car in the morning all 9 speakers would blow him out of the car, the wipers would go, the heat would blast on high. Just the fact that I'm alive is evidence of how good and patient a man he was. But man did he hate our rock and roll music. And I must say, if he were alive today, I think he would look back on my classic rock with fond memories. I know I do. Clapton and Hendrix could make a guitar sing compared to what these kids do today. And forgive me for referring to Clapton in the past tense, cuz he can still do it today. emoticon_xgood",

An interesting story; when I was 14, my best friend who is catholic, invited me to join him on an outing with the CYO. Because it was a religious group, my folks let me go.

It wasn't that I didn't like their music but I resented the worship they received by the whole world and rejected them on that basis. It wasn't until long after they broke up that I gained a sincere appreciation for their music and legacy. \n \n The fact is we had so many great musicians that made so much great music that we were spoiled in that generation. The Who's Rock Operas, J Geils, Jethro Tull and ZZ Top were also standards in my VW Bus with a killer stereo with an 8 track player, box speakers and the back seat converted into a bed with 3 inches of padding under the rug on the floor. My dad called it my whore house on wheels. emoticon_ic \n \n We used to go up to the Kancamagus Highway Kancamagus Highway White Mountain Vacations New Hampshire Travels on the Kancamangus every weekend during the summer to camp and party. I would open the doors and crank up the music and in no time the young people from the neighboring sites would show up and by dark we had a kegger going with new friends we would never see again from all over the country sometimes, partying with us. And you know what, not one fight ever broke out between any of these people. It was truly a time of peace and love for everyone. Even the Game Wardens who would inevitably show up around 11:00 to tell me to turn the music down were cool and would sometimes have a beer with us before continuing their rounds.",

I wouldn't say it's 'popular' among any age group, but I've never heard anyone above the age of 40 listening to it (though pretty much all the good bands have musicians aged 40+). And I've rarely heard anyone above the age of 35 listening to it. So I guess it could be considered a thing that's more popular among teens.",
