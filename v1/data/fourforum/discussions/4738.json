   "A fine how-d'ye-do! Interpol European branch sent its agents to Latvia in order to fact-find the death of own nonstaff officer who had fallen a victim to \"Chechen Mafia\", based in Latvia now. Mafiosi exercise control over drug traffick, passed through this Baltic republic to Europe. And some circumstances of Interpol agent's death leave no doubts that Latvian police buried Interpol officer to Chechen bandits. Now the Latvian side takes up the position that everything had happened quite by chance, as Latvian security officers didn't know that the dead man worked for Interpol. But I think their European colleagues have all reasons to believe it is spoofing. Interpol has already dealt with similar cases, when Latvian police covered up for criminal leaders of local Chechen Diaspora. Well, we've been asking for it...",
