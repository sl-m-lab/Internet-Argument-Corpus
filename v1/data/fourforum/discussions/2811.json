Homophobia is the fear of homosexuals. Fear of them, fear of being victim to what you may \"belive\" are the sterotypes.\n \n Heterophobia would be the same deal. Maybe it is the fear the a straight person wouldn't accept you (sterotype) when in realtiy they could give rats...\n \n Heterophonia would also be a gay employer not hiring a straight person because they wouldn't handle their gay clients well enough. When in relaity the straight person could very well be comfortible with themselves sexually and not care if guys/girls hit on them. (yes I know I can't seem to spell today to save my own life)\n \n \n Of course I realize I contradicted my above post. So yes, I reconsidered. Gays like women have the right to change their minds whenever they want! (just kidding)\n \n \n On the other hand....I am feeling sort of indecisive today....Those things could also be internalized homophobia. Your own fears about your own homosexuality. The world is filled with so much fear, it scares me!",

I got the impression that they just wanted a place that was \"theirs\". They wanted somewhere where they didn't have to worry about what other people thought. Of course, that is discriminatory, and illegal, but given how much gays have to put up with I wasn't going to begrudge them their gym.\n \n This was in the Castro district of S.F., in case that matters to anyone.",

So in reality it's all in terms of heading off the lawsuit. Just speculation that is. \n \n One reason I'd hire gays instead of straights is that I won't have to pay them maternity/paternity leave. emoticon_xgood",
