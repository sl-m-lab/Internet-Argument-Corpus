   "I was surprised of reading the article, called \"Observer\", in one of our publications. Much to my astonishment (pardon for reiteration) I've known that according to our new laws Muslim women, living or arriving at the United Kingdom, are allowed not to have their pictures taken for new identified documents. It's common knowledge that Islamic norms dictate these women to be fully covered when traveling outside their villages. These norms prohibit Muslim women to open their faces in public. But it's a problem for them, not for us. When in Rome, live as Romans live. The photo for your identification is not bureaucratic means of our society. It's a real necessity for our security nowadays. How can't our government understand the results of its unselfish policy in circumstances of terrorist danger all over the world? Blair turns Great Britain into \"hotbed of terrorist infection\". Think of it! Documents without photo at all... It's a dream of live for Islamic extremists. It's interesting to note, however, that our premier is furiously fighting against Islamic terror everywhere, but not at home.",

   "Perhaps a tasteful number tattooed on the inner forearm would satisfy the bureaucracy, serve security and retain cultural aspects? With modern plastic surgery techniques and illegal entry to most any country a breeze, what purpose does a photo actually serve to enhance security? After 9/11 in the US and other, world-wide incidents, do we think serious terrorist types are going to be stupid enough to acquire driver licenses in a conventional manner when, thanks to modern technology, perfect forgeries complete with database backup are readily available?",

Think about the size of the alternative identity market that would create. Technology works both ways and a major problem in many US States is under-the-table selling of driver licenses by DMV employees, so chips would generate a similar market. Letting the ladies wear their veils and adjusting our foreign policies would be a reasonable fix, but that's not going to happen.",

I, for one, will never wear such a device, as I believe it would condemn me to everlasting fire. But, I am not sure I understand your stance on the subject. Although, the tattoo on the forearm is a bit extreme, why is it that we shouldn't be able to photograph the women? I respect their beliefs, but why can't they respect our requirements? If you don't want your picture taken, stay away. Plain and simple. Yes, there would be the black market id's, but why make it any easier to get in than it already is?",
