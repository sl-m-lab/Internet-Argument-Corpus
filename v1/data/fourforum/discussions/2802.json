   "\"LET ME EXPLAIN THE problem science has with Jesus Christ,\" The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand. \"You're a Christian, aren't you, son?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \n \"So you believe in God?\" \n \n \"Absolutely.\" \n \n \"Is God good?\" \n \n \"Sure! God's good.\" \n \n \"Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \" Are you good or evil?\" \n \n \"The Bible says I'm evil.\" \n \n The professor grins knowingly. \"Ahh! THE BIBLE!\" He considers for a moment. \"Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over here and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help them? \"Would you try?\" \n \n \"Yes sir, I would.\" \n \n \"So you're good...!\" \n \n \"I wouldn't say that.\" \n \n \"Why not say that? You would help a sick and maimed person if you could... in fact most of us would if we could... God doesn't.\" [No answer.] \n \n \"He doesn't, does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Hmmm? Can you answer that one?\" \n \n \n [No answer] \n \n The elderly man is sympathetic. \"No, you can't, can you?\" He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax. In philosophy, you have to go easy with the new ones. \"Let's start again, son.\" \n \n \"Is God good?\" \n \n \"Er... Yes.\" \n \n \"Is Satan good?\" \n \n \"No.\" \n \n \"Where does Satan come from?\" \n \n The student falters. \"From... God...\" \n \n \"That's right. God made Satan, didn't he?\" The elderly man runs his bony fingers through his thinning hair and turns to the smirking, student audience. \"I think we're going to have a lot of fun this semester, ladies and gentlemen.\" He turns back to the Christian. \"Tell me, son. Is there evil in this world?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \n \"Evil's everywhere, isn't it? Did God make everything?\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"Who created evil? \n \n [No answer] \n \n \"Is there sickness in this world? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness. All those terrible things - do they exist in this world? \" \n \n The student squirms on his feet. \"Yes.\" \n \n \"Who created them? \" \n \n [No answer] \n \n The professor suddenly shouts at his student. \"WHO CREATED THEM? TELL ME, PLEASE!\"The professor closes in for the kill and climbs into the Christian's face. In a still small voice: \"God created all evil, didn't He, son?\" \n \n [No answer] \n \n The student tries to hold the steady, experienced gaze and fails. Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace the front of the classroom like an aging panther. The class is mesmerized. \n \n \"Tell me,\" he continues, \"How is it that this God is good if He created all evil throughout all time?\" The professor swishes his arms around to encompass the wickedness of the world. \"All the hatred, the brutality, all the pain, all the torture, all the death and ugliness and all the suffering created by this good God is all over the world, isn't it, young man?\" \n \n [No answer] \n \n \"Don't you see it all over the place? Huh?\" Pause. \n \n \"Don't you?\" The professor leans into the student's face again and whispers, \"Is God good?\" \n \n [No answer] \n \n \"Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?\" \n \n The student's voice betrays him and cracks. \"Yes, professor. I do.\" \n \n The old man shakes his head sadly. \"Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you seen Him? \" \n \n \"No, sir. I've never seen Him.\" \n \n \"Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?\" \n \n \"No, sir. I have not.\" \n \n \"Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelled your Jesus... in fact, do you have any sensory perception of your God whatsoever?\" \n \n [No answer] \n \n \"Answer me, please.\" \n \n \"No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't.\" \n \n \"You're AFRAID... you haven't?\" \n \n \"No, sir.\" \n \n \"Yet you still believe in him?\" \n \n \"...yes...\" \n \n \"That takes FAITH!\" The professor smiles sagely at the underling. \"According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your God doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son? Where is your God now?\" \n \n [The student doesn't answer] \n \n \"Sit down, please.\" \n \n The Christian sits...Defeated(?). \n \n Another Christian raises his hand. \"Professor, may I address the class?\" \n \n The professor turns and smiles. \"Ah, another Christian in the vanguard! Come, come, young man. Speak some proper wisdom to the gathering.\" \n \n The Christian looks around the room. \"Some interesting points you are making, sir. Now I've got a question for you if that's okay. Is there such thing as heat?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" the professor replies, frowning. \"There's heat.\" \n \n \"Is there such a thing as cold?\" \n \n \"Yes, son, there's cold too.\" \n \n \"No, sir, there isn't.\" \n \n The professor's grin freezes. \n \n The room suddenly goes very cold. The second Christian continues. \"You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat but we don't have anything called 'cold'. \n \n We can hit 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold, otherwise we would be able to go colder than 458 -- You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. \n \n We cannot measure cold. Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. \n \n Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.\" Silence. A pin drops somewhere in the classroom. \n \n \"Is there such a thing as darkness, professor?\" \"That's a dumb question, son. What is night if it isn't darkness? What are you getting at...?\" \n \n \"So you say there is such a thing as darkness?\" \n \n \"Yes...\" \n \n \"You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something, it is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to define the word. In reality, Darkness isn't. \n \n If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker and give me a jar of it. Can you...give me a jar of darker darkness, professor?\" \n \n Despite himself, the professor smiles at the young effrontery before him. This will indeed be a good semester. \"Would you mind telling us what your point is, young man?\" \n \n \"Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must be in error....\" \n \n The professor goes toxic. \"Flawed...? How dare you...!\"\" \n \n \"Sir, may I explain what I mean?\" \n \n The class is all ears. \n \n \"Explain... oh, explain...\" The professor makes an admirable effort to regain control. Suddenly he is affability itself. He waves his hand to silence the class, for the student to continue. \n \n \"You are working on the premise of duality,\" the Christian explains; \"that for example there is life and then there's death; a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. \n \n Sir, science cannot even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen, much less fully understood them. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. \n \n Death is not the opposite of life, merely the absence of it.\" \n \n The young man holds up a newspaper he takes from the desk of a neighbor who has been reading it. \"Here is one of the most disgusting tabloids you can buy, professor. Is there such a thing as immorality?\" \n \n \"Of course there is, now look...\" \n \n \"Wrong again, sir. You see, immorality is merely the absence of morality. Is there such thing as injustice? No. Injustice is the absence of justice. Is there such a thing as evil?\" The Christian pauses. \n \n \"Isn't evil the absence of good?\" \n \n The professor's face has turned an alarming color. He is so angry he is temporarily speechless. \n \n The Christian continues. \"If there is evil in the world, professor, and we all agree there is, then God, if he exists, must be accomplishing a work through the agency of evil. What is that work God is accomplishing? \n \n The Bible tells us it is to see if each one of us will, of our own free will, choose good over evil.\" \n \n The professor bridles. \"As a philosophical scientist, I don't view this matter as having anything to do with any choice; as a realist, I absolutely do not recognize the concept of God or any other theological factor as being part of the world equation because God is not observable.\" \n \n \"I would have thought that the absence of God's moral code in this world is probably one of the most observable phenomena going,\" the Christian replies. \"Newspapers make billions of dollars reporting it every week! Tell me, professor. Do you believethat we have evolved from a monkey?\" \n \n \"If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes, of course I do.\" \n \n \"Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?\" The professor makes a sucking sound with his teeth and gives his student a silent, stony stare. \n \n \"Professor. All previous attempts to explain how the process works have failed. Since no-one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a priest?\" \n \n \"I'll overlook your impudence in the light of our philosophical discussion. Now, have you quite finished?\" the professor hisses. \n \n \"So you don't accept God's moral code to do what is righteous?\" \n \n \"I believe in what is - that's observable science!\" \n \n \"Ahh! SCIENCE!\" the student's face splits into a grin. \"Sir, you rightly state that science is the study of observed phenomena. What you call \"science\" too is a premise which is flawed...\" \n \n \"SCIENCE IS FLAWED..?\" the professor splutters. The class is in uproar. \n \n The Christian remains standing until the commotion has subsided. \"To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, may I give you an example of what I mean?\" The professor wisely keeps silent. \n \n The Christian looks around the room.*Sir, the basic law of physics says matter can neither be created nor destroyed, and yet you in spite of that believe in \"spontaneous generation\" of the entire physical universe! Spontaneous generation of vermin was disproved centuries ago. \n \n Talk about straining out the gnat and swallowing the camel! Sir, biogenesis is \"observable science\" as you say--life has only been observed to come from other life of like kind--and yet you apparently still believe that that is exactly what happened--in spite of science--that life somehow came from non-life. \n \n Young man, the professor began tersely, I believe that science will eventually.... \n \n \"That science will eventually prove that matter can be created, that life can come from non-life\" interrupted the young Christian? Sir, that's not science--that's Faith! What you believe is the exact opposite of \"observable science\"!Your faith is in what you are calling \"science\", my faith is in God who created \"science\". \n \n Make no mistake, Professor, we're both operating from faith.\" \n \n There follows a long pause as the Professor stares the young Christian down without a word. \n \n \"Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor's mind?\" The class breaks out in laughter. The Christian points towards his elderly, crumbling tutor. \"Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's mind... felt the professor's mind, touched or smelled the professor's mind?\" \n \n No one appears to have done so. The Christian shakes his head sadly. \"It appears no-one here has had any sensory perception of the professor's mind whatsoever. Well, according to the rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol and science, I DECLARE that the professor has no mind.\" The class is in chaos. The Christian sits... Because that is what a chair is for, and begins filling out a drop slip.",

Morally bad or wrong; wicked; 2. Causing ruin, injury, or pain; harmful. \n \n is there such an event possible that causes no ruin, harm or pain to everybody? lets say i build a device that cleans the air and give it away free to every home. thats a pretty good deed, wouldnt you say? but i'd put other air-purification companies out of business and cause people to lose their jobs. that does sound like it could cause ruin. plus by giving it away free i'd be contributing to inflation by not generating income for the state/country. maybe not diabolical, but that would be pretty harmful. is it really possible to remove all events that could cause pain to at least 1 person in the world, so we only have happy events?\n \n lets look at a major disaster, like a major landslide wiping out a village. this is not something humans can directly control. it may turn out that the exposed hillside may be a major geolical discovery that could benefit humans in the future. or simply by studying what caused the landslide, it made it necessary to develop the technology that better handles that kind of dissaster. there's a saying that \"necessity is the mother of invention\". with every dissaatrous event comes new opportunities for advancement that we may not have seen otherwise\n \n lets look at pain. pain is the body's way of signalling to the brain that something is wrong. emotional pain is a result of a situation that is disappointing or tragic. if we cant remove potentially painful events, perhaps we could remove painful sensations and the trauma involved. this would mean that youd be blissfully unaware that standing in the sun too long is causing you or the people around you to dehydrate and collapse, because you cant feel pain or sorrow.\n \n if you were God, and you had all the time and energy, plus all the power, ability and wisdom, what would you do, or at least recommend, to alleviate the pain and suffering in the world?",

   "I would like to jump in here with a thought.\n \n Evil comes from the mind of those that have volition, which includes mankind and the angels. God created all things. When He created Lucifer He gave him the ability to think and do as he pleased &#8211; the freedom to choose right or wrong. Lucifer took that power and decided to overthrow God&#8217;s government, and to assassinate God &#8211; which brought evil into the Heavenlies. God wouldn&#8217;t allow that in His domain, so He cast Lucifer to earth, which, through Eve (as the Bible states) Lucifer introduced evil to mankind.\n \nI see your point, and I can't say you're wrong. None the less, my gut (which I admit is not my most rational part) tells me that if a benevolent God really was pulling the strings, things would be a bit quieter around here, particularly in the earthquake, hurricane, tornado area. You're right that people are going to die, and someone will always say that it's unfair and unneccesary, and I don't have access to any \"master plan\" which might explain why these things are acually good to have around. All I can say is that if I were in charge, I'd do away with natural disasters which cause wide spread death and destruction. They may have their part in the grand scheme of things, but I can't see how.\n\n God created the earth to be inhabited. On earth there are natural disasters. But, that&#8217;s the way He created it. He will not control mankind and therefore will not control Mother Nature. If He did He would, by proxy, control mankind. He is, however, in control of His &#8220;plan&#8221; for mankind. For those that blame God for these disasters, think about it for a moment. Why would God with all His power stop the natural processes for any reason? He would be in control of man&#8217;s house, which He already claimed was not his business. He told mankind to go forth, multiply and to subdue the earth. He did not say the He would control the earth, but that mankind was to do that. Even though we have no idea, yet, how to do that, it is our job to do so, or at least attempt/strive to live with it &#8211; and in some areas we are getting better (storm and volcano eruption warnings, for example).\n So, as far as the &#8220;master plan&#8221; involving total control of nature, there isn&#8217;t one.\n \nThe only arguments here seem to be that there is a reason for 'evil' in a world that contains evil. Surely if there was a kind god who has allowed there to be a toughening up facility built into organisms then why wasn't the default setting for all created organisms the best one.\n\n Earth is essentially &#8220;off limits&#8221; to any kind of supernatural control. Earth is the place given to mankind &#8211; man was formed from it and will return to it. It is our souls that require our flesh to be subdued in order to live, just like our flesh requires the earth to be subdued in order to live. This is not to say that we are in control of nature, but that we must adjust our thinking to gain control through knowledge. That is what the creationists, who deem science as evil, just can&#8217;t grasp. Knowledge is power &#8211; a power that will someday enable us to subdue the whole earth including nature. I don&#8217;t believe we will ever be able to &#8220;turn off&#8221; nature, but will find a way to live with it. Knowledge, I believe, is the &#8220;toughening-up facility&#8221;.\n \n Therefore evil is the opposite of good, not its absence.\n\n That&#8217;s true. But, I would like to point out that since evil is the opposite of good, it does not mean that the father of evil is opposite of God. Since there is no equal to God there can be no opposite &#8211; IMHO.\n \nEliminate childhood cancer, or at the very least, the pain associated with it if you insist it's benefitting someone, somewhere in the slightest to watch a five year old become decimated with the disease. It isn't BTW, and it doesn't require omniscience on my part to state that.\n\n Bad things do happen to good people, just like good things happen to bad people &#8211; you know that, billsco. What is not seen here is the basic pattern of how God intended life to be on earth. Man did wrong at the outset. God told man not to choose evil, but man did. In the Garden man, who was given volition from the beginning, had many, many good choices, but instead of making the right ones, he chose to do opposite of what God said. God could have stopped &#8220;time&#8221; turning it back, so to speak, and reminded man to no eat of that specific tree. For that matter He could have never put that tree there in the first place. But, in order for His plan to work, mankind had to choose&#8230;and we know the rest.\n So, childhood diseases, rape, murder, incest, cancer, retardation, etc., are earthly devices, some of the many things we are to subdue. To do away with, slander, defame, discredit, or to believe that science and medicine is of the devil and is therefore evil is like saying that a tornado is the &#8220;finger of God&#8221;.",

   "You seem to be agreeing with me in the specifics, but then drawing a different conclusion. We're being punished for what two people did, and it goes against all the laws of ethics. But you seem to think that because it violates the laws of ethics on a global scale, it's ok. To me, that just makes it worse. I repeat, mankind didn't do anything, it was just two people thousands of years ago. And the fact that there's a chance for redemption doesn't seem to be a mitigating factor to me. First off, what about the eons before Jesus? But more importantly, I shouldn't need to be redeemed for something I didn't do! \n \n As for the question of pain, I have no desire to eliminate it entirely; it has its uses. It's the excessive pain and suffering, caused by huge natural disasters, that make me question the existence of a benevolent God.\n\n i didnt say its ok. its very wierd logic, but its resolved by equally wierd logic, so in that way it balances. you are being redeemed for something you didnt do by acknowledging another action that you didnt do. cool isnt it?\n \n if you remove the most extreme pain, then the pain just less than extreme will become the most extreme. we can keep shaving down the highest level of pain, but even if the most extreme pain left is hunger pangs, its still the most extreme pain. the only way to eradicate extreme pain is to remove pain altogether.",

How art thou fallen from heaven,O Llucifer, Mourning star,son of the dawn!how art thou cut down to the ground,which didst weaken the nations! For thou has said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven,I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation,in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High[Isaiah14:12-14] He was described first as Lucifer,the shining one.

They had no concept of good and evil, they had no experence with trickery, and yet God has Satan, the prince of lies, tempting them. Of course they were tricked, how could they possibly not have been? Imagine a 4 year old kid, who's never met a bad person in his life, standing in a candy store while a very friendly looking person says, \"Go ahead, take one piece, it's ok\". Now mulitply by 1000.

A good read.\n \n http://www.theosophy-nw.org/theosnw...st/xt-ibel2.htm\n \n\n There are quite a few views about who Satan (Lucifer, the devil, the evil one, etc.) really is. Some say he was here when Eloi&#8217;s (God, Yahweh, Jehovah) spaceship landed in what is now called Lebanon. Satan was neither good nor evil, light nor darkness, he just was. To these believers he is what makes up the emotions in mankind. He and Eloi fought over who would rule the earth and Satan won, driving Eloi back out into space.\n Another version has Satan as being Jesus and vice versa.\n If a person is prone to believe as the winds blow, they are certain to become mad, IMHO. There is just too much confusion out there for those who seek the truth. It&#8217;s scary, really.\n I hope my &#8220;less than a plug nickel ego&#8221; never gets me to the point that I doubt my belief.

Lucifer is divine and terrestrial light, the \"Holy Ghost\" and \"Satan,\" at one and the same time, visible Space being truly filled with the differentiated Breath invisibly. Satan, or the Red Fiery Dragon, the \"Lord of phosphorus\" (brimstone was a theological improvement) and Lucifer, or \"Light Bearer,\" is in us: it is our Mind, our tempter and Redeemer, our intelligent liberator and Saviour from pure animalism. Without this principle, the emanation of the very essence of the pure divine principle Mahat (Intelligence) which radiates direct from the Divine Mind -- we would be surely no better than animals.\n\n \n At least these guys think that there&#8217;s a difference between humans and animals, which is a plus for them, huh? :p",

Rather than search the OT for support of the modern interpretation of Satan, she just read what the OT actually said, and saw that it didn't support the modern version at all.\n\n I see what you&#8217;re getting at, now. First, should we consider that Lucifer is a &#8220;light-bearer&#8221;? And secondly, is he to be associated in anyway with Satan?\n From that article I gathered that they questioned the Bible &#8211; which I suppose they are, but in a different manner than I took it. I suppose that&#8217;s where the confusion came in.\n Lucifer, the Light-bearer:\n In Ephesians 6:21 we read that the Holy Spirit (through Paul) is saying that the &#8220;rulers (plural) of the darkness of this age&#8221; are fighting against us. How could a spirit (angel) that is clearly described as being of light, be also of darkness? Could Lucifer and Satan be two different entities?\n In this board (and in reality) we have discussed the fact that darkness is the absence of light; cold is the absence of heat, etc. God created an angel far above the other angels. This angel was the most beautiful, the most powerful, and the brightest (as in luminous, shining). This angel&#8217;s name is what is widely accepted as Lucifer. But was he named correctly, i.e., was his name properly translated? From what I understand (and I will see if I can find it on the net, later) the term &#8220;Lucifer&#8221; was taken by the King James Version translators from Jerome&#8217;s Latin Vulgate edition of the Bible. The Hebrew word is Heylel, which suggests the idea of &#8220;shining,&#8221; or &#8220;bearing light.&#8221; Jerome understood it as meaning &#8220;Morning Star&#8221;; and so he rendered it by it&#8217;s Latin name &#8220;Lucifer.&#8221; Again, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but this &#8220;morning star&#8221; would be Venus, which is not a star at all, but a planet that gets its light (or reflected light) from the sun.\n Despite what humans have called him over the years, I believe that evil is and will be the Lord of Darkness. The Bible itself gives us a clear meaning who and what the Evil One is. To go further would put it in line with the mythical creature of Pythagoras or Minerva and the muses.\n But, at least, I can see where your post and that link were going. And I have to agree: To take the Bible and read it, as anything other than a guide, would be confusing.\n \nI don't see anywhere in the article where it says that we should see Lucifer as Christ. If anything it says the opposite; that it's very odd that the same symbol, light, is used for both good and evil.\n\n No, it didn&#8217;t. But I felt it necessary to add my comment, since there could be confusion when reading some translations and not referencing them back to the text in which they were written. A Strong&#8217;s Concordance is a valuable and necessary tool, IMHO.",
