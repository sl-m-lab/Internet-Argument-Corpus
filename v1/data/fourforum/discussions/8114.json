I want to be treated fairly--especially since, as a woman, I certainly am not going be given preference--so I endeavor to treat others fairly and hope that they will return the favor.\n\n I have no problems with you taking my quote to start this thread - permission granted retroactively. :) \n \n As to my answer to your quote, I agree that there is a self-serving aspect to morality as well. Part of the reason that we do not believe people should have the right to hurt others is that we ourselves don't want to be hurt. However, there are many moral situations where we could, for example, torture an animal knowing that we humans would never be placed in that situation. In those situations, it is mainly our compassion which stops us. \n \n I would say that there are many aspects that contribute to ones sense of morality:\n \n 1) Our world view: religious vs. scientific or both, self-serving vs. altruistic, oriented toward the practical vs. the pleasureable, etc. This is often defined by the society in which we live and can often be the most variable. This aspect is the one that most often leads to conflicts about morality when multiple world views clash.\n \n 2) Emotion: Our moral attitudes are often shaped by our senses of compassion, our senses of outrage, or other related emotions. It is hard to extracate those reactions from most people's approaches to morality. I once read about an interesting experiment in which apes starved themselves for the sake of other apes since, when they pulled the cord to get food, their fellow apes would get electric shocks. That shows that at least part of our sense of compassion and self-sacrifice is based on our biology. Therefore, these emotional reactions tend to be common among a large swath of humanity. However, these reactions are shaped by our assumptions, as defined by our world view.\n \n 3) Self-Serving: Essentially, we know that any general moral rules would apply to ourselves as well, so, for example, we are against murder partly because we ourselves would also not want to be murdered.\n \n 4) Logic or lack-thereof: Too often, our sense of morality can be based on knee-jerk reactions instead of being thoroughly thought out. One can argue about the logic of one world view vs another world view that underlie moral attitudes. However, even if you agree with a particular world view, moral beliefs are sometimes logical progressions from that world view and sometimes irrational knee-jerk reactions that may have some vague connection to that world view.\n \n Anyway, those are at least four aspects I could come up with that influence our sense of morality. Of those, I believe that the differences in world view (1) and the use or lack-of use of logic (4) are what cause the largest conflicts.",

How do we overcome these differences in world views and the lack of logic?\n \n Gad, you know how people hate it if you tell them they're being illogical.\n\n World peace can be achieved if we all spent an hour a day in meditation about peace... Oh, if only there could be such a simple formula. Of course, I know you were joking, but still, I would say that, though there is no easy formula, one thing that would at least contribute toward world peace would be if we at least all made an effort to understand the other's point of view instead of jumping to assumptions about it. Far too often, we try to jump to demeaning assumptions about those with opposing views instead of hearing them out (I'm sometimes guilty of this as well.). There may be illogic in some of their views (as there also may be illogic in some of ours) and sometimes there is simple self-serving maliciousness, but there are also reasonable aspects which we have to acknowledge. People and national leaders simply want to be respected and understood. If we (at both the individual and national level) at least make an effort to understand the point of view of the adversary and let them at least partially \"save face\", then the global level of tension would decrease. This would not work in all situations, but I believe it would ease the tension in quite a few situations.\n \n Where encountering illogic on an individual level is concerned, I believe that the best approach is to keep the discussion (on our side at least) at a calm, respectful tone, and ask the opposing side questions which make them see for themselves the illogic of their position. In other words, don't tell them they are being illogical, let them figure it out for themselves by trying to understand their point of view through probing questions. If they realize the illogic of their views, they may close down but, if you remain respectful, there may be a large chance that they may later reconsider their position. If I held a view that was illogical, that is how I would like to be approached. Sometimes, a difference of opinion may simply end up being based on an irreconcilable difference in world views but, even then, rarely does one influence others by taking a disrespectful tone.\n ---\n On Edit: I know that much of this may sound like wishful thinking. However, in so many situations - both in politics and in war - the crux of the problem seems to be that people jump to extreme negative conclusions about their opponent. People have a tendency to demonize the enemy. Through propaganda, they take away from the enemy that part of humanity that one could sympathize with. After all, it is difficult to kill someone for whom one has sympathy. We cannot control the attitude of others in politics and war but we do have control over our own reactions. I simply advocate that instead of sinking to the psychological level of our enemies by keeping a closed-mind about their worth or the validity of their arguements, we should try to understand our opponents while continuing to defend ourselves against any unreasonable actions on their part. As citizens of the US (or any other first world country), I believe we have some responsibility to serve as examples to others in having our nation act in a responsible, not a knee-jerk reactionary, way.",
