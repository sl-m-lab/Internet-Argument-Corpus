Bush's CAFTA is about to do the same.\n \n I agree with Michael Savage...we should outsource congress...we could get a lot of cheap representatives in several foreign countries. We might even find a group that's willing to work in an abandonned warehouse.\n \n We could hire these people to write laws favoring special interest groups, spend half their time investigating each other and let then retire on full salary pensions....just like our Congress does right now, only we could get them for peanuts on the dollar!",

   "Both depend on ones view of a global economy. If you're a realist and understand the US standard of living is way out of proportion to be competitive in a global society, they make very good sense. \n \n If your viewpoint is focused on the worker retaining a high standard of living supported solely by the upper 10% of taxpayers and government subsidies, you'll curse both agreements. \n \n Both the US and developed EU countries better get their acts together pretty quick and blend their economies with under-developed countries offering low labor and compliance costs to lower general standards of living in the developed countries. Otherwise China, India and other developing nations with large populations and low per-capita incomes are going to steam-roller global economics right over them. \n \n Many people forget that individual wealth at the top tier doesn't sustain itself and grow based on emotional patriotism. Money makes money and it goes wherever the best return happens to be. Right now, that's not in mature countries where workers are living in high cotten.",

The more you know about it, the less you want to eat it. \n \n Know what's sick? Ground beef used in fast food, particularly Jack in the box and McDonalds is more sanitary then the ground beef in your local grocery mall.",
