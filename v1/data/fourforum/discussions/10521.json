   "So the Catholic Church ends all adoption if forced to stop is bigotry and now the boy scouts in the case is blaming everyone but themselves and their bigotry for having to cut 30 new cub packs or 800 needy kids going to summer camp. \n Hey, I have an idea, stop being bigots and there would be no problem. How novel. \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071018/ap_on_re_us/philadelphia_scouts_eviction_2\n \n \nThe city has decided that the Boy Scouts chapter here must pay fair-market rent of $200,000 a year for its city-owned headquarters because it refuses to permit gay Scouts.\n \n The organization's Cradle of Liberty Council, which currently pays $1 a year in rent, must pay the increased amount to remain in its downtown building past May 31, Fairmount Park Commission president Robert N.C. Nix said Wednesday.\n \n City officials say they cannot legally rent taxpayer-owned property for a nominal sum to a private organization that discriminates. The city owns the land and the Beaux Arts building constructed by the Scouts in 1928.\n \n Scouting officials will ask the city solicitor for details on the appraisals that yielded the $200,000 figure, said Jeff Jubelirer, spokesman for the Cradle of Liberty Council.\n \n The higher rent money \"would have to come from programs. That's 30 new Cub Scout packs, or 800 needy kids going to our summer camp,\" Jubelirer said. \"It's disappointing, and it's certainly a threat.\"\n \n The Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that Scouts, as a private group, have a First Amendment right to bar gays from membership.\n \n The council adopted a nondiscrimination policy in 2003 but was ordered to revoke it by the National Council, which said local chapters cannot deviate from national rules barring participation by anyone who is openly gay.\n \n The Cradle of Liberty Council serves about 64,000 scouts in Philadelphia and its suburbs.\n",

You look for every reason you can find to justify or excuse discrimination against gay people, because you really are NOT on the side of full equality, obviously. \n \n The Boy Scouts ban ALL gay people, including closeted gay people. They ban gay people as both scouts and as leaders. They don't even play \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" They ban all gay people period, including lesbian mothers who may want to be den mothers. It doesn't matter if you promise to stay quiet about your sexual orientation; you're still excluded. \n \n You suggest that gay people are somehow attacking a group that does a lot of good. On the contrary; the Boy Scouts have attacked gay people by excluding us. It's the Boy Scout organization you should be denouncing here, not gay people who stand up for what is right. The Boy Scouts are NOT a wonderful organization; they are dominated nationally by the Mormon Church, and I know plenty of parents of boys who will not let their sons join the Boy Scouts because of the pro-military, pro-religious values they spread. If they are a private organization, they have the right to spread whatever values they want, and they have the right to discriminate against whomever they choose. But they don't get the privilege of government support. They can't have it both ways. \n \n I know many people, notably parents, of all sexual orientations who dislike the Boy Scouts. I don't know any people or parents who harbor those negative feelings about the Girl Scouts, which is a very different organization. And the Girl Scouts do not discriminate against gay people.",

He wanted Scouting to be open to all boys.\"\n http://ffrf.org/timely/bsa.php\n \n Loss of support\n Some public entities and private institutions have ceased financial or other support the BSA, primarily as a result of conflicts between their nondiscrimination policies and the BSA's membership policies. About 50 local United Ways, including those in Miami, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Seattle, have withdrawn all funding. The BSA has also lost all funding from several large corporations that had been regular donors, such as Chase Manhattan Bank, Levi Strauss, Fleet Bank, CVS/pharmacy, and Pew Charitable Trusts. For example, Pew Charitable Trusts, which had consistently supported the BSA for over fifty years, decided to cancel a $100,000 donation and cease future donations. A number of public entities (including the cities of Chicago, San Diego, Tempe, Buffalo Grove, Berkeley, and Santa Barbara, as well as the states of California, Illinois, and Connecticut) have canceled charitable donations (of money or preferential land access) that had historically been granted to the Scouts.\n \n Eagle Scout filmmaker Steven Spielberg had been a long-time supporter of Scouting, depicting a young Indiana Jones as a Boy Scout in the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and helping to create the Cinematography merit badge. Spielberg resigned from the BSA Advisory Council in 2001, saying, \"it has deeply saddened me to see the Boy Scouts of America actively and publicly participating in discrimination.\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies#_note-parents",

That is true, and it's a response to your suggestion that everyone likes the Boy Scouts, even though they discriminate against some boys and leaders. No, not everyone likes them, and many people strongly dislike them. Many people do not want their sons to be taught to embrace military values. You may disagree with those parents, but there are parents who feel this way. \n \n The Boy Scouts organization nationally has come to be dominated in recent years by the Mormon Church. To be dominated by one particular church means that the organization has come to reflect the specific values and beliefs of this church, and not of other faiths and faith traditions. The Boy Scouts exclude both gay boys and boys who are atheists, as well as leaders who are either gay or atheist. The central Boy Scouts organization does not allow individual troops to adopt policies and practices contrary to those that are dictated by the central organization. They kick out troops that practice non-discrimination. \n \n If the Boy Scouts organization chooses to be a specifically Mormon organization, that's up to them. But they should not demand or expect special privileges from the government. I think they should also not present themselves as open to all boys, because they are not, as they exclude gay boys and atheist boys. \n \n Closeted gay people are banned from the Boy Scouts. They are banned because they are gay. It's not like the military where a gay person can serve so long as he or she stays in the closet. If a closeted gay person is a Boy Scout or a Boy Scout leader, they are violating national Boy Scout policy. \n \n To say that you can be a closet gay Boy Scout or Scout leader is to say that you can be a Boy Scout or a Scout leader by being dishonest, and dishonesty is contrary to the Boy Scout principles dating back to before the Scouts were dominated by any particular church. You are telling people that they can be Boy Scouts and be dishonest, and that's not a message that the Boy Scouts have historically sought to send.\n \n I have said that the Boy Scouts, as a private organization, can discriminate on any basis that they choose, and they can teach whatever values they choose. That's up to them. But when they teach immoral values, like discrimination against gay people and against atheists, we don't have to like them or applaud them or support them. Just as it's their right to discriminate and to spread their values, it's our right to criticize them and to choose not to support them. It's not only our right, but our duty, I think, to refuse to give them government privileges or government support.",

   "No, there are two very big problems with those statements. One is the it assumes (automatically) that \"domination\" in an organisation of a religious group automatically means they will not be open to other faiths. In all liklihood, the BSA will continue accepting other faiths as well, even if Mormonism is or does become the dominant sort of people in the organisation.\n \n Second, your post still approaches the matter that the BSA being heavily Mormon is automatically a bad thing. This is no less prejudiced that the very prejudice oppose. You couch it in terminology like \"many people\", trying to give the appearance of a more-objective distancing on your part, but what is YOUR view? Otherwise, I might as well assume that IS your view since that's how you answered my post.\n\n \n The Mormon Church does seek to control the Boy Scouts. That's why they ban gay people and atheists. They are NOT open to all boys, as the founder of the Boy Scouts intended the organization to be. My father loved the Boy Scouts when he was a boy, but he would not love them now. He would not be permitted to join the Boy Scouts if he were alive today, because he was an atheist. \n \n Because I do not have a boy and am not involved in the Boy Scouts, I have no stake in what the policies of the Boy Scouts are. That is up to them,and my opinion of them is irrelevant. If I had a boy, would I encourage him to join the Boy Scouts? No. I would not encourage my son to join an organization that would exclude his mom from participation or force him to embrace a religious belief. There are other organizations for boys that do not discriminate and that do not impose any religious requirement on their members.\n \n FYI, I do not feel this way about the Girl Scouts, and I am a Girl Scout parent leader.

   "The BSA is no longer the organization its gay founder had hoped it would be. Its connection with the Mormons make it part of a cult. I wonder if the BSA today have magic underwear too?\n\n \n I would not call Mormonism a \"cult\" any more than any other religion. I think that the domination of the Boy Scouts by the Mormon Church has indeed changed the values of the Boy Scouts, and I think this has been negative for the organization. I don't agree with the values of the Mormon Church that call for discriminating against gay people or discriminating against atheists. And I find objectionable the Mormon Church's insistence that all Boy Scout troops adhere to their religious values by discriminating against gays and atheists. However, since I am not a parent of a boy in the Scouts, this is not directly my concern. \n \n Jyoshu apparently thinks that any criticism of a church and its actions reveals \"prejudice.\" That's simply not true. When churches act in the public arena, which many do, they should be subject to critical scrutiny by citizens. Being a church does not somehow immunize them from criticism when they act to influence public policy. It's not \"prejudice\" to criticize the Mormon Church for unduly seeking to impose its religious values on the Boy Scouts. Prejudice is pre-judging someone, and in this case, there is no \"pre\" about it. The Mormon Church IS currently exerting much control over the Boy Scouts, and it IS currently demanding that Boy Scout policy reflect the church's religious agenda. \n \n One can argue, of course, that since the Boy Scouts are a private organization, they can do whatever they want and reflect whatever agenda they want. That is true, but the Boy Scouts have been trying to have it both ways. They have claimed to be private, and thus free to discriminate, and they have then turned around and demanded that they get special privileges and financial breaks from the government. If they want to be private and discriminate, that's fine. I really don't care what they do in that case. But when they demand that our tax money support their discrimination, then we need to object. And their being dominated by a church does not and should not make them immune to public criticism for this. \n \n Meanwhile, the Girl Scouts just go along selling their cookies, without forcing any religious agenda on anyone and without discriminating against anyone. The one objection people have had to the Girl Scouts is that their cookies contain trans fat. The last I heard, they are moving to make their cookies trans fat free.",

You didn't criticise the Mormons (as your post that I'm responding to here implies); rather you criticised the BSA by bringing up the Mormons. (Or that it's a reason the BSA is opposed.) You made a straw man argument and are responding to it instead. And now you're basically generalising by dredging up stories of sex abuse as if that speaks to anything more than the cases they involve. \n \n \nIf the Boy Scouts did not permit African American boys to join, would you still call them an organization with a \"good and reputable standing in society?\"\n\n \n If they did good and reputable things, like civil service projects as the BSA does, then yes I would. After all, there are black groups that don't permit white people to join. There are black-only colleges, black-only fraternities, etc. FYI, I DO think it's a double-standard that society has no problem with black-only groups, but usually automatically calls it racism if there's a white-only group. \n \n \nWhen you are a member of a group that is being excluded, it's not a \"single issue.\" It means you don't get to participate at all.\n\n \n Nope. I can think of many examples I would not be allowed to join, and I don't make a fuss over it. Women's groups for instance. Or I don't get to join MENSA because my IQ isn't in the top 2% of the population, but you don't see me waging a PR campaign over it or acting like I'm being treated unfairly. My son may not get to play on a certain sports team if he isn't athletic enough. \n \n When it comes to the BSA letting some in and some not (gays or atheists, or whatever), I say get over it--just like we all do when there are groups out there who's criteria we don't meet. (And FWIW, I'm not so convinced they are as intolerant as you're painting them to be here. I think it depends enormously on the sentiments of invidual groups, sort of like the ways churches are--some are tolerant in practice, some are not.) If you don't like the BSA, no one is forcing you to support them. But it's a relatively poor use of time and valuable resources to wage a battle with them over it, which is my original point. This isn't like govt. benefits where there are things you *NEED* that are being denied. (That IS a problem and worthy of a fight.)

I am not \"dredging\" it up. I simply reported it, because it's interesting, and it reveals the Mormon connection with the Boy Scouts. You can analyze it and interpret it if you want to. The charge from the plaintiffs is that the Mormon Church did nothing to address the alleged sexual abuse, which makes this similar to what people have charged about the Catholic Church. Is this a pattern of behavior by the Mormon Church, as the plaintiffs appear to allege, or are these isolated instances? \n \n To the bigger question you asked: Is the Mormon domination of the Boy Scouts \"bad?\" If you are Mormon, then probably no. The Mormon Church has made the Boy Scouts its organization for boys. If you are not Mormon and you want to be part of the Boy Scouts, then this domination by a religious sect probably is bad, because the Mormon Church imposes its values on ALL Boy Scouts and troops. Those troops that do not wish to practice discrimination will be kicked out of the Boy Scouts if this comes to the attention of the national body. This has been an objection by individual troops to the policy of the national Boy Scouts organization. \n \n It's not \"prejudice\" to point out the impact of this domination by a church sect of the Boy Scouts. It's pointing out the truth. This domination by a church sect is the reason the Boy Scouts will not budge on their policy banning gay people and atheists from the organization. \n \n The people challenging the Boy Scouts' policy have not been primarily gay people or gay groups. It's not the national lgbt organizations that have been fighting this battle to change the Boy Scout policy or to cut off the Boy Scouts from government privileges; it's former Boy Scouts and Scout leaders themselves. There is an organization, started by a Boy Scout who is not gay, called Scouting for All. This organization works to try to change the Boy Scout policy of discrimination. It is made up mostly of former Boy Scouts, especially Eagle Scouts.",

   "How is that question in any way relevant? One would almost think that you're saying that bigotry is fine, as long as those being discriminated against are free to form their own club. That you support the formation of a secondary social class, seperate but nominally equal. That attitude is, in itself, a rather bigoted attitude. One should not be forced to make one's one club, one shouldn't have to accept being excluded for no good reason. (good reason folks, let's avoid stupid analogys, ok?) That's the whole point here. The fact that people could make their own club doesn't matter one whit, it's the fact that the Boy Scouts discriminate that is the issue.\n \n The simple existence of a private club does not provide you an inalienable right to membership. A private club may in all conscience deny access to left handed people, people with brown eyes, USC Football Fans, etc. The suggestion that I am advocating a secondary separate class is ridiculous and indefensible. History is replete with organizations who started as splinter organizations \"separate but nominally equal\" as you would have it. Two of these splinter groups now dominate the political spectra as the Democrat and Republican parties. You think these organizations are second class? Ask a Whig or a Federalist. If your views are in line with public values your new club will flourish, if not - join the dustbin along with the freesoilers and know nothings. \n \n Strawmen aside, if you exclude a whole class of people for no justifiable reason, then you are pretty much by definition a bigot. \n \n I'll accept that if you can come up with a justifiable reason for the following colleges to exclude me on the sole basis of sex:\n \n Judson College \n Mills College \n Mount St. Mary's College \n Scripps College \n The Women's College of the University of Denver \n Hartford College for Women \n Saint Joseph College \n Agnes Scott College \n Brenau University \n Spelman College \n Wesleyan College \n Lexington College\n Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College \n Saint Mary's College \n Midway College \n Newcomb College \n College of Notre Dame of Maryland \n Bay Path College \n Lesley College \n Mount Holyoke \n Pine Manor College \n Regis College \n Simmons College \n Smith College \n Wellesley College \n College of Saint Benedict \n College of Saint Catherine \n Blue Mountain College\n Mississippi University for Women \n Cottey College \n Stephens College\n College of Saint Mary \n College of Saint Elizabeth \n Douglass College (Rutgers University) \n Georgian Court College \n Barnard College \n Marymount College \n Russell Sage College\n Stern College of Yeshiva University\n The College of New Rochelle \n Wells College \n William Smith College\n Bennett College \n Meredith College \n Peace College\n Salem College \n Ursuline College \n Bryn Mawr College \n Carlow College \n Cedar Crest College \n Chatham College \n Immaculata College \n Moore College of Art & Design \n Rosemont College \n Wilson College \n Columbia College \n Converse College \n Texas Women's University \n Hollins University \n Mary Baldwin College \n Randolph Macon's Women's College \n Sweet Briar College \n Westhampton College\n Trinity College \n Alverno College\n Mount Mary College\n\n \n The issue here is not whether people can form a private club and exclude whomever they want. The issue is whether this private club should then get government privileges, including financial privileges. The Boy Scouts cannot have it both ways. They can be a private club, but then they should be treated as a private club and not be given support by the government if they want to discriminate.\n \n Also, the main movement to change the Boy Scouts is coming from former Boy Scouts and leaders and from individual troops within the Boy Scouts. It's not an initiative of gay rights groups. People who identify as Boy Scouts, many of them Eagle Scouts, are the ones primarily challenging the Boy Scout policy of excluding atheists and gay people. They are doing this not as a legal battle, since the Supreme Court has already labeled the Boy Scouts a private organization. They are challenging the Boy Scout policy as private citizens seeking to change a private club to which they either belong or used to belong.",

   "Nope. I can think of many examples I would not be allowed to join, and I don't make a fuss over it. Women's groups for instance. Or I don't get to join MENSA because my IQ isn't in the top 2% of the population, but you don't see me waging a PR campaign over it or acting like I'm being treated unfairly. My son may not get to play on a certain sports team if he isn't athletic enough. \n \n When it comes to the BSA letting some in and some not (gays or atheists, or whatever), I say get over it--just like we all do when there are groups out there who's criteria we don't meet.\n\n \n The people challenging the Boy Scouts national policy of exclusion are not gay rights groups; they are former Boy Scouts and Scout leaders, many of them Eagle Scouts. Are you telling Eagle Scouts, people who committed their lives to the Boy Scouts and then learned that they are unwelcome in the organization to which they devoted much of their lives, to \"get over it?\" \n \n Scouting for All, the organization devoted to pressuring the Boy Scouts to change and get rid of its anti-gay and anti-atheist exclusion, was founded by a Boy Scout who is not gay. He was appalled when he learned about the exclusionary policy of the organization he had come to love. He challenged the Boy Scouts from within, was rebuffed, and then went on to form Scouting for All, which is not an alternate organization for boys, but a group of folks pressuring the Boy Scouts to be open and inclusive of all, which was the original purpose of the Boy Scouts. \n \n Many of the Eagle Scouts who have joined Scouting for All say they never knew the Boy Scouts had a policy of excluding gay people and atheists; they had given their hearts and lives to Scouting before they discovered that gay people and atheists were not welcome. Further, individual Scout troops have disagreed with the policy imposed by the national body, and these whole troops have faced explusion from the Boy Scouts for doing so.\n \n Of course, this is a fight among those who want to be Boy Scouts and Boy Scout leaders. I have no interest in being a Boy Scout leader, and so it is not directly my issue. A number of years ago I phoned the national Boy Scouts organization in Washington, and I asked them if I, a lesbian, could serve as a Boy Scout leader if I had a son in the Boy Scouts. They said no, I would be banned from serving, even if I had a son in the Boy Scouts. I am a parent leader in the Girl Scouts, as they have no such ban.",

   "First, the sex abuse story is a current story, from this month. I am not \"dredging\" it up. I simply reported it, because it's interesting, and it reveals the Mormon connection with the Boy Scouts. You can analyze it and interpret it if you want to. The charge from the plaintiffs is that the Mormon Church did nothing to address the alleged sexual abuse, which makes this similar to what people have charged about the Catholic Church. Is this a pattern of behavior by the Mormon Church, as the plaintiffs appear to allege, or are these isolated instances? \n\n \n Oh, I bet it IS interesting to you.\n \n As someone who has debated by defending a class of people who have unfairly had to answer the same such accusations, you should know better. I get the impression that people think these groups like Mormons and Catholics can just prevent people from doing something bad somehow. That they can flip a switch and make this sort of thing not happen. It doesn't work that way; unless you're either a conspiracy theorist or just have a guilty-'till-proven-innocent view about Mormons (which is prejudice), then you should assume these are isolated cases. Gays don't like being associated with child abuse just because there have been gay people that have engaged in such evil activity. Well, neither do religious people.\n \n \n ... because the Mormon Church imposes its values on ALL Boy Scouts and troops.\n\n \n Evidence?\n \n \nIt's not \"prejudice\" to point out the impact of this domination by a church sect of the Boy Scouts. \n\n \n It is when you portray it automatically as a bad thing. You've pre-judged. That's what prejudiced means.\n \n \nThere is an organization, started by a Boy Scout who is not gay, called Scouting for All. This organization works to try to change the Boy Scout policy of discrimination. It is made up mostly of former Boy Scouts, especially Eagle Scouts.\n\n \n I think that's great, and if that's the organisation that fits one better, then that's the one they should join if they want. Again, we're talking about private organisations and preferences here, not about the govt. meeting peoples' needs.\n \n \nMany of the Eagle Scouts who have joined Scouting for All say they never knew the Boy Scouts had a policy of excluding gay people and atheists;\n\n \n And that's one reason why I suspect it's not so wide-spread a problem; they didn't even know about it.

Or are you going to have no input in this thread that isn't sarcasm?\n \n The only thing you have heretofore contributed is mislabeling of Irony as Sarcasm. \n \n As to your really simple question concerning validity: The point you have missed and OhProf has grasped is that it is not up to you or me or anyone else to determine the validity of the Boy Scout's membership criteria any more than the criteria of the women's colleges. The validity is provided by the first Amendment's right to free association and by SCOTUS's affirmation of same:\n \n Quoting J. Madison, et al: \n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n \n The amendment does not address freedom of \"valid\" speech, redress of \"valid\" grievances or prohibition of \"valid\" religion and it does not permit Congress to restrict the rights of private groups to assemble as they see fit. \n \n Further, SCOTUS in its 2000 ruling in Boy Scouts of America and Monmouth Council, et al., Petitioners v. James Dale found: \n \n \"We are not, as we must not be, guided by our views of whether the Boy Scouts' teachings with respect to homosexual conduct are right or wrong; public or judicial disapproval of a tenet of an organization's expression does not justify the State's effort to compel the organization to accept members where such acceptance would derogate from the organization's expressive message.\"\n \n endquote.\n \n No Mutz, that's where you are wrong. They may legally deny access to whoever they want. But to have a good conscience, they can't deny access to a whole class of people with good reasons. That's bigotry, and it's immoral.

It is not just for you to tell a private organization who it may or may not admit. It is not fair for you to serve as the sole arbiter of what is moral on the one hand and to proclaim as \"dumb, immoral or bigoted\" all that disagree with you. \n \n \n What a bizzare misinterpretation of what I said. Was I really that unclear, or are you just playing dumb?\n \n Ad hominem again. This is approaching pathology. \n \n \n Presumably, my dear Kronus, you would not be content to have the BSA determine what is right and moral for the members of this forum. It is curious, paradoxical even, that some members of this august forum are so willing to impose their own moral code upon the BSA. \n \n OhProf has nailed it.

How might your definition differ from another? \n \n\n \n You've got it backwards. The state must have a good reason for enacting a law that discriminates against individuals or denies them a fundamental right. Individuals do not need a good reason to exercise their right to free speech; the state must have a good reason to deny an individual the right to free speech. The standard of having a good reason, or more accurately a reason that meets one of three standards ranging from a compelling state interest to a rational basis, applies to the states, not to individuals. States must have a good reason, according to the Supreme Court, to deny gay people equal treatment under the law. As the Court ruled in Romer v. Evans, animus against gay people is not a rational basis for enacting a discriminatory law.",

   "It's the Supreme Court that has set the standard. The term \"compelling state interest\" comes from the Supreme Court, in determining whether a state law violates the 14th amendment. The Court applies a 3-level test to balance the interests of the states versus an individual right. The highest level, strict scrutiny, requires that a state have a compelling interest in enacting a discriminatory law. The lowest level of scrutiny requires only that a law have a rational basis. These are not terms invented by gay rights activists like us; they come from the Supreme Court.\n\n \n None of that is any less subjective.

   "That's the 9-ton problem with the statement constantly posed that it has to have a \"good\" reason or the equally subjective, \"compelling\" reason we hear so often from gay marriage proponents. Who the heck is to be compelled here, and who sets that standard??? \n\n When it comes to the government, the standards on \"reason\" are required by the constitution.\n The government can't just arbitrarily decide to discriminate without a \"good\" reason. And there are plenty of legal rulings which establish what constitutes a \"good\" reason on a variety of subjects, if you're truly interested.\n \n As for personal / private discrimination, \"because I feel like it\" is all the reason that is needed.\n \n Despite Mutz's insistence on avoiding that simple question, if the BSA had decided to exclude gays \"because they come from Venus and we don't want no aliens\" that would be entirely legal.\n And entirely stupid.\n Just because a personal / private discrimination is legal doesn't mean there is a \"good\" reason behind it. And judging from the obfuscation of some, that's an obvious fact that some people just don't want to admit... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nI think the better way to argue it is to say that we should have equality not because of some arbitrary standard out there of what's \"compelling\", but rather as long as it simply benefits people measurably with no measurable negatives on society.\n\n That's a bit like arguing something is red as opposed to dark maroon.\n \n \n \nAnd giving equal benefits to same-sex couples certainly falls into that category, IMO. Either way, society will have to be adequately convinced before it happens just in terms of the way things tend to work.\n\n Since you brought up gay marriage, it should be pointed out that the legal standard is that the government needs to present a compelling reason for why discrimination SHOULD occur.\n Not for why it should stop, as the constitution places the burden of proof on discriminator.\n \n If you truly feel that standard should change, you should work on constitutional amendments.\n \n But as for private organizations, like the BSA, they are certainly free to ignore whatever rationale does or does not exist for or against their chosen discrimination.\n They are free to discriminate irrationally just like the KKK does...",

The same applies for the \"rational\" one. It doesn't matter that it was SCOTUS who set up such standards, it's STILL a subjective one.\n\n \n Yes, of course it's subjective, as we are always human beings setting the standards for deciding anything. But when we work in the area of law, we have to work with the standards set by the courts in determining what the law is. You may feel that the Supreme Court has set an \"arbitrarily subjective requirement\" in insisting that states show a compelling state interest in enacting certain kinds of discriminatory laws, but that's the standard they have applied. If you go in to argue a case before the Supreme Court in which you challenge the constitutionality of a state law on the basis of the 14th amendment, you need to use the standards that the Court has set. \n \n The Supreme Court applies various balancing tests to weigh the interests of a state versus the rights of individuals. That is because, as we have discussed earlier, the rights of individuals are not absolute, or at least the Supreme Court has ruled that they are not. Nor are the powers of the states absolute; states cannot go too far in denying rights to any individual. So when the powers of a state come up against the rights of an individual, the Supreme Court applies its tests, or standards, to determine whether the state abridgment of the individual's rights, through its laws, are unconstitutional. \n \n The Boy Scout case of James Dale was a clear example of this that cut in the direction that most conservatives approve of. In that case, the state had passed an anti-discrimination law. The Supreme Court had to weigh whether the interest of the state in applying its anti-discrimination law to the Boy Scouts went too far and was unconstitutional. Did the right of the Boy Scouts to free association and to having the choice of their own members outweigh the interest of the state in prohibiting the Boy Scouts from discriminating? In that case, the issue revolved around whether the Boy Scouts are a public or a private organization. The Boy Scouts argued that they are entirely a private organization, and they therefore have a first amendment right of free association that the state cannot constitutionally abridge. \n \n It was an interesting and difficult case, because prior to this, the Supreme Court had issued a ruling in a similar circumstance regarding the Jaycees and whether they could discriminate against women. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Jaycees are a public organization, and thus the state could require that they admit women. In the James Dale case, they ruled the opposite: the Boy Scouts are a private organization and thus have a first amendment right to include or exclude whomever they choose. It's hard, frankly, to see how the Boy Scouts are more private than the Jaycees, who seem to me to be no more public than the Scouts are, but that is how the Supreme Court ruled, leaving a big question mark about the standard of determining private versus public, as the two rulings appear to be inconsistent. But, c'est la vie.\n \n So in that case, the Supreme Court sought to balance the interests of the state in banning discrimination versus the right of the Boy Scouts to freely associate and to ban whomever they choose, and they found that the Boy Scouts, as a private organization, have the right to ban whomever they choose. One might argue that this is an \"abitrary requirement\" or standard of the state, and it seems that it is, at least when it comes to deciding which organizations are private and which are public. But it's the standard we must live with. \n \n I personally have no problem with the Supreme Court ruling, as I value the right of individuals to associate in private with whomever they wish. I am disappointed for the many gay Boy Scouts and leaders, and for the boys who get the message from this that gay people should be excluded. But that is for the Boy Scouts to decide, not me. There are groups within and outside the Boy Scouts who are working to pressure the Boy Scouts to change their policy, and these are not gay groups; they are Boy Scout members and leaders and ex-members and leaders. I also think the Jaycees probably should have the right to exclude women if they want to, as they seem no more public than the Boy Scouts are, but the Supreme Court has ruled otherwise.\n \n My issue with the Boy Scouts is that they should not receive privileges from the government at the expense of taxpayers. So long as our tax money does not go to support them and our government does not give them special privileges, they can discriminate all they please.",

   "This is pretty much the point I've been utterly failing to get across to Mutz. If you have a valid reason for excluding someone or some group, that's ok. Blind crossing guard? Not something that would really work, so keeping the blind out of the crossing guards is perfectly fine. Jews in a golf club? I can't think of any reason why that would be a problem, so keeping someone out of your golf club for being Jewish would be wrong.\n\n \n That's easy to say for cut and dry issues like that. Where it gets iffy is when they aren't so cut and dry, like the Mutz's women-only colleges example. I don't think anyone here would say, as Lesz seems to think, that discrimination has to be consistent all across the board in every conceivable case. But in such examples where it should be consistent, an attempt to do so would certainly be nice to see. :)",

   "How literally do you mean that? If a group is being actively homophobic, or racist, or sexist, or displaying any other of discrimination you care to mention, are you really fine with that as long as they don't get government money? I'm not talking about legally fine, I'm talking about personally. \n \n To my mind discrimination is wrong, it's immoral. And I believe that people of good conscious ought to speak out against wrong when they can, otherwise it's unlikely to stop.\n\n \n I do think the Boy Scouts are wrong, but since they are a private organization, and one that I have no personal interest or stake in, I do not spend my time denouncing them. I don't give them money. I don't support them, but I don't actively try to change them either. In a free society, there will always be private groups with whom we disagree and whose beliefs and practices we find odious. While there is nothing wrong with denouncing them, I think that we need to evaluate carefully when and why we are choosing to denounce a particular group and when and why we are choosing to try to change them. I do not find it worth my energy to go around denouncing the Boy Scouts. I am more inclined to work against and to denounce groups that actively try to strip us gay people of our civil rights, groups like Focus on the Family and Concerned Women for America and the people who publish Worldnet Daily. For me, it's a matter of choosing priorities, and denouncing the Boy Scouts is not a top priority for me. It may be for you, and that's fine.",

Sure, it would be nice if answers were always easy and straightforward, no argument there. Of course, this being reality, involving people and all, they aren't always.

I'm not sure because I can't really tell what you meant by \"discrimination has to be consistent all across the board in every conceivable case\", but I am sure that she was saying that discrimination is not the same across the board, and that in fact telling people that can't join a group is perfectly justifilable in certain situations.

In so doing how are you not attempting to impose your personal moral code on the BSA?\n\n By this lack of logic, we could compare Abraham Lincoln to the slave owners he fought against.\n Oh yes.

Hopefully thus demonstrating the validity of the earlier premise.\n \n He does not \"dismiss\" it at all.\n \n For some reason, you completely and utterly fail to recognize how a freedom of assembly and freedom of speech can coexist in various forms.\n \n The other poster supports THEIR LEGAL RIGHT to exclude.\n He does NOT support the EXCLUSION itself.\n \n It's a bit like supporting another person's freedom of speech to say something you don't like.\n \n The key-phrase being \"at the expense of another's viewpoint\".\n \n How has the other's \"viewpoint\" suffered in this case by somebody else using the freedom of speech?\n \n It amazes me how people like you routinely complain and whine about the label \"bigot\" (which I still have not called you), and then try to neuter it of any meaning so that everybody is a bigot.\n \n It would be like somebody saying, \"I don't like being called a homo sapien! We are all homo sapiens!\"\n \n To answer your question, no.\n Would you care to address my point that your observation is meaningless, and that almost every \"bigotry\" has a claim to \"morality\", and is also condemned as bigotry by others with a different \"morality\"?\n -----------------------------------\n \n I'll take your refusal to respond to the issues, while endlessly complaining about being victimized, as a sign you don't want to address the areas where you are clearly wrong and instead want to try and \"win\" by conceding.",

Now, there is nothing wrong in principle with Christian colleges or students wanting to learn in a safely Christian environment, but there is something academically very wrong with preventing the free movement of people and ideas. \n \n (And this is not to claim that Christian colleges are obliged to be hospitable to people who do nothing but violently attack Christianity on their campuses; that wouldn't be part of any mission to provide a safe and supportive religious environment for learning. However, censoring and attacking even respectful differences of opinion as dangerously heretical is antithetical to any institution of higher learning. No such institution deserves to be called a college.)\n \n Women's colleges are not exclusive because they condemn men intellectually or morally in general; they are exclusive in order to provide a safe and supportive environment for learning for women. Whether one agrees with the need for such colleges these days or not, it is at least an honest and ethical reason. Similarly, a Christian college that merely wants to make its students feel welcomed in an overtly religious environment are unexceptionable -- one doesn't have to agree with their religion to allow that they have a valid function for those who share it. \n \n It's institutions such as the BSA and those Christian colleges who seek to denigrate and exclude gay people that have the ethical and intellectual problem. They are criticised not because they claim to provide a safe academic environment for Christians, but because they act as a thought police promoting bigotry against gays. It's bad religion, it's bad education, and it's rotten humanitarianism.",

In the days when the BSA acted as a public institution, living off the public teat, it was respected, and its opinion mattered. Not so much, any more. \n \n But how does the BSA cause harm? Not too difficult to figure out. Consider Joe Schmoe, the gay kid on the block. All his male friends are members of the boy scouts, but he's been kicked out because he was overheard saying that Brad Pitt (or whatever current male sexual icon) was cute. So there he is, singled out among all his friends and neighbors as being too perverted and degenerate to be a member of the BSA like his friends.\n \n You are arguing this does him no harm at all, in a homophobic society? The BSA endorsing homophobia does him no harm? I don't think so.\n \n \nWe aren't talking about govt. benefits here, we're talking about something that people can (or certainly don't have to) join voluntarily. I think it's quite the stretch to say the BSA is \"hurting\" gays. They aren't with-holding anything anyone is obliged or guaranteed to get. This isn't like a rights-issue, where there's real world consequences to family and livelihood. You're going to be pretty hard-pressed to prove how anyone is really getting \"harmed\" here.\n\n \n Well, if the BSA were a truly private organisation, if they had no public impact whatever, then what you say would be true. But historically speaking, membership of the BSA used to be something one mentioned proudly on one's CV. It was an organisation people wanted to join. It had a major public profile, and considerable support from public funding.\n \n Now it wants to be treated as a private organisation constitutionally, but still have access to the same sort of public funding it had become used to. Now there's some inconsistency.\n \n I used to argue that since the BSA was a public accommodation in practice, it was subject to anti-discrimination laws. Well, the Supreme Court disagreed with me, and in this case I'm willing to go along with it and change my mind. The BSA is a wholly private institution, and it shouldn't expect any public support whatever.\n \n \nAlso, in some ways, forming other scouting alternatives sort of takes the onus off the BSA even farther to be held accountable for \"hurting\" gays. It's harder to claim they are \"harming\" kids when there are scouting alternatives out there they could choose anyway. It's sort of like saying a church is \"harming\" people by not letting people who hold to incompatible doctrine join their congregation, when in fact there are other churches out there where those people could join that would be far more compatible. By forming alternative scouting groups, the issue has changed somewhat from a harmful discrimination issue to a compatibility discrimination issue.\n\n \n Well, perhaps the BSA is so far along the path of being characterised as a bigoted religious institution that what it does no longer matters. Everyone expects it to be bigoted, and so what is the harm, so long as it gets no public money? It would just be the juvenile equivalent of the KKK -- not illegal but not supported, either. Let it do its thing, and no-one should be surprised to find prejudice rife in its ranks. Its reputation has sunk considerably since this blister broke.\n \n Still, this board came about because the BSA was refused special preferential treatment by a public authority that decided to treat it as any other private organisation.

   "They are both consistent with each other in that there is no good reason to discriminate in either case.\n \n One thing I keep noticing is that people keep shifting back and forth here between the constitutional/legal issue and the moral issue, when it comes to discrimination, and answering questions about the moral issue with an answer about the legal one, when that's not the point. I am not talking about the legal issue. Everyone here, I assume, is in agreement that the BSA (as well as these colleges) are well within their rights to discriminate, and it is perfectly legal for them to do so. However, the question of whether it is right or wrong to do so is not the same question. The legal question is settled. I don't think anyone here is arguing against the legal issue. You can take it off the table. I'm not talking about that, and so you can assume that I'm not.\n \n The inconsistency I was talking about was indignation over one case and not the other. The criteria Kronos used was that there needs to be a valid reason for excluding someone, or (as he put it) \"it's wrong\". NEITHER or these cases presents a valid reason. These days, there is no valid reason for having a women-only rule for a college. I think (though not entirely sure) that you've agreed with that for the most part, so it seems to me that to have indignation over one case and not the other is a case of inconsistency.\n\n \n So do you express indignation over the Christian colleges that discriminate against gay people and against anyone who does not adhere to their specific creed?",

This policy sets\n out the Scout Association's view on such matters\n including the acceptance and support of being gay\n and having an adult role in Scouting.\n \"There is no basis on which any volunteer\n offering his or her services in any capacity\n can be refused an appointment in, or\n Membership of, the Movement on the\n grounds of heterosexual or homosexual\n orientation. Homosexuality has been\n perceived as incompatible with Scouting by\n some people (both within and outside The\n Scout Association) on the basis of a\n presumed link between homosexuality and\n paedophilia. This perception has been\n used to deny homosexual people the\n chance to work with young people as\n Scout Leaders. There is no link between\n homosexuality and paedophilia, and\n therefore there is no justification for\n restricting Membership on this basis.\"\n The Scout Association guidelines are clear, nonnegotiable\n and support individual members\n regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\n \n Now why couldn't THAT be the standard for the BSA?

(Source: Census of Membership 2006.)http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs295101.pdf\n \n \n \nWhat is the reason boys who are gay cannot participate in this group of boys? Why can't gay men be leaders as well as straight men? There is no reason, which is why you answered my question with a diversion. I can see the thread is now discussing women's colleges and we are once again off the topic, which is usual, because the case for gay exclusion is morally indefensible.\n\n \nBack to square one I see.\n\n Questions typically do get repeated when they aren't answered the first time around...\n Or the umpteenth time around...\n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nThe policy is legal.\n .... \n That is one dead horse!\n\n Repeating \"The policy is legal\" when people are not arguing the policy is illegal?\n Yes. A very dead horse indeed!\n \n \n \nWell there it is, problem solved.\n\n That's a bit like saying \"Well, there's a *black* water fountain too, so problem solved!\" emoticon_xbouncer",

   "So there was a basis for this claim.\n \n If your claim was that membership in the UK has fallen for 22 years then risen irrespective of the BSA policy on homosexuals then yes, there would be a basis for that claim.

To try to diffuse the \"moral\" argument.\n \n Three of the polls state things which ARE NOT EVEN IN DISPUTE on this thread.\n Over and over again, people on this thread have explicitly agreed that it should, legally, be allowed to discriminate if they want to. That it is their constitutional choice to do so.\n Heck. The statistics on this message board show a higher \"support\" for the current legal situation than those polls show.\n \n As for the other two, the first question is incredibly poorly phrased.\n Or possibly it is very well phrased if you don't want to examine the actual issue at hand.\n \"...opinion of the Boy Scouts of America\n has either not changed or has improved since learning that the group\n does not allow homosexual members.\"\n 1) Combining \"no change\" with \"improved\" is a ridiculous way to lump things together. It provides no way to delineate \"improvement\" with \"no change\".\n 2) Phrasing it as is doesn't even ask what the person's opinion actually is.\n If the person's opinion is negative of the Boy Scouts, and the BSA situation doesn't make it more negative, then he is in that group.\n 3) And what of the people who already knew of the BSA's position?\n Having what they already knew repeated to them isn't going to have their opinion changed. Ergo, they are also in that group...\n \n \n And as for the last poll, polling members of the BSA on their opinion of the BSA position is like polling members of the Baptist church whether or not they agree with a belief of the Baptist church....\n If we polled the gay community like the BSA polled their community, do you think the results would be different? emoticon_rolleyes",

   "I think the US Supreme Court has settled the issue of the legality of prejudice in the BSA -- it's a private organisation without state support, and it is permitted to exercise its right to bigotry. Case closed, unless of course, the BSA decides to try to become a public organisation again with state support.\n \n The only issue left to discuss is the ethics and morality of discrimination by the BSA, and what sort of message it is sending to the community as a whole. I don't take rising or falling enrollment as evidence of anything very much -- one cannot read minds and see why parents decide to enroll their sons there or elsewhere, or nowhere at all. But I have seen a rise in public awareness that the BSA is an organisation that promotes discrimination against certain groups of Americans, and state and local governments are correspondingly more willing to question their support of it, since they discriminate openly against part of the public whose taxes support those governments.\n \n The BSA has brought this on themselves by their prejudicial policies, and they have no-one to blame but themselves.

   "As to the awkward squirming about whether discrimination by the BSA is a contributor to gay teen suicide, you would rarely be able to prove that some boy committed suicide specifically because of homophobia by the BSA,\n \n Nevertheless, the BSA actively contributes to a climate of hostility against gay people, and that necessarily increases the stress they are under. Such stresses are going to be experienced far more sharply by teens than by gay adults who have learned how to cope better emotionally with hatred and discrimination against them.\n \n Social scientists who study teen suicide have noted that gay teens are more likely to off themselves than straight teens, and the only factor they have been able to detect in this is hostility towards gay people that can make life unbearable in far too many tragic cases. To any extent that the BSA, or any other organisation including churches, contributes to this, they share part of the responsibility.
