   "This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong.\n \n ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about \"evolution\" he's not talking about mere phenotypic change - he's talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that \"evolution\" has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered \"evolution.\" The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now:\n \n Let's take humans and dogs, for example. When compared side-by-side, sure enough, humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not - and possibly the other way around. But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs don't, does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs. Of course, there are no \"dog genes\" or \"human genes.\" But likewise there are no \"tongue genes,\" \"tail genes\" or \"toenail genes.\" Parts are not translated genes. Thus, the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible.\n \n But it's worse than that.\n \n As I said before, humans have a whole slew of genes - theoretically, at least -- that dogs (or other animals) don't have. But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms! That's why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have...But they've got it backwards! Instead, we have the genes we have because of who we are. A dog isn't a dog because he barks; a dog barks because of what he is. Same with genes.\n \n This, of course, spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.\n \n But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them. They simply won't give up because they've seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses.\n \n But here's where they're screwing everything up:\n \n When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head? If so, did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time? If so, do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head? Or, do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red? That's excactly what science is doing with genetics: they've got the audacity to claim that changes in genes (the red face) is causing the organsim to change physiologically (go upside down.) In reality, what's happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment (turning upside down) and then the genes are responding in kind (turning red).\n \n The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things:\n \n 1) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures. \n \n 2) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over.\n \n \n So there it is. Go for it.",

   " \n \n Anyone who believes that a fish could turn into a human without changing its genotype, please leave now.\n\n \n you are sidestepping the issue: any trait that appears and gets passed on is not considered \"evolution\" unless there is a change of genes. For example, if a population of mice find and consume a new diet that their parents did not consume, it might reshape their jaws or teeth if they come upon this new diet early in life when their bones, teeth and jaws are moldable. As long as the diet remains available, future offspring will continue to sport these new jaws and teeth, which would be different (and beneficial) than their ancestors' jaws and teeth. But this is not \"evolution\" to you guys. Neither is it \"evolution\" if baby mice emerge with different coat colors based on what their mother ate. There is no changes in DNA, thus -- to you - no evolution. The reality is, nobody knows what the limits to biological change are without a change in genes. Gene expression goes along way. For example, every cell of your body contains the same sets of genes...but the genes in your kidneys are expressed differently than the genes in your brain. Same in different animals. Cats have the same basic eye gene that flys and other organisms do...the difference is in the way they are expressed. A change in expression is very often brought on by an interaction between the organism and it environment and has nothing to do with new genes or mutations....thus, once again -- no \"evolution.\"\n \n But likewise there are no \"tongue genes,\" \"tail genes\" or \"toenail genes.\"\n \n Evidence?\n \n yea -- silence.\n \n Parts are not translated genes\n \n Evidence?\n \n yea -- silence.\n \n \n \n You say that as if studying genetics was a waste of time.\n \n it is.

The fact that science refuses to test purposeful, heritable variation in real, living organisms speaks volumes. The fact that all they care to do is bury their noses in genes and play dumb that each creature operates in the context of its ecological environment also speaks volumes.

   "This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong.\n \n ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about \"evolution\" he's not talking about mere phenotypic change - he's talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that \"evolution\" has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered \"evolution.\" The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now: \n\n \n Well the premise you claim is not the core premise of evolution. Indeed Darwin never invoked genes at all. He did make the observation that some variability was clearly inherited (but not all variability), he also observed that some variants survived and reproduced better than others. From this he concluded that natural selection operated to change the heritable traits exhibited by populations, and extended this to resulting in large changes over long times. Changes sufficient to result in new species which were reproductively isolated or nearly so. To an actual Darwinist genes did not enter the theory at all - they were not known at the time except to an obscure Monk who published in a less than prominent journal!\n \n As to a fish morphing into a human without any genetic alterations .... Produce a case where that has happened and we can discuss it in depth. Till then I will claim that such a transformation cannot be accomplished without alteration of the underlying genome. I am most dubious that you have any such example at hand. emoticon_xgood",

And no, science is testing the flexibility of genomes, developmental biology is cutting edge science and has been since the DNA code was cracked. It's just that most genomes aren't all that flexible (and none of them are limitlessly flexible!) and have a limited repertoire of phenotypic changes they can accommodate.\n \n It may be that epigenetic changes alone might account for some examples of microevolution where there is diversification of subspecies within a species and hybridisation is still possible, but that's a long way from being confirmed. It isn't going to be able to account for macroevolution, where there are known and quantitated changes in the genome. \n \n For example, although chimp and human genomes are very similar (but not identical), no-one has seriously suggested that the distinct and stable phenotypes are solely the result of epigenetic changes. Instead, what has been postulated is that relatively minor changes in DNA sequence or arrangement can cause considerable alteration in the patterns of gene expression. Human and chimp genes that encode structural proteins are very similar, with almost the same genes present, but the genes and DNA sequences involved in controlling the timing and location of structural gene expression have subtle differences in sequence, number and position.\n \n This is still a story we're just at the beginning of, but there is nothing I can see in it so far that disproves Darwinian theory. No sign of lurking Lamarcks here!\n \n \nAnd the tail thing is a strawman. Nobody would claim that brutalizing an animal would lead to evolution. Instead, what a lamarckist would claim is that internal responses to environmental cues may be inherited.\n \n Weismann was a conman who propped up a giant strawman....and all of science fell for it.\n\n \n Well, when someone comes up with a mechanism for Lamarckian evolution, then biologists will accept it. I can't see one even on the horizon, not even in the new buzzword epigenetics.",

   "Giraffes were actually created with long necks. I challenge you to show me any gradual change from some other short-necked animal to a long-necked giraffe. Longer-necked giraffes may come about through sexual selection.\n\n \n No problem -- some fossil data here:\n Giraffes: Branched off from the deer just after Eumeryx. The first giraffids were Climacoceras (very earliest Miocene) and then Canthumeryx (also very early Miocene), then Paleomeryx (early Miocene), then Palaeotragus (early Miocene) a short-necked giraffid complete with short skin-covered horns. From here the giraffe lineage goes through Samotherium (late Miocene), another short-necked giraffe, and then split into Okapia (one species is still alive, the okapi, essentially a living Miocene short-necked giraffe), and Giraffa (Pliocene), the modern long-necked giraffe.\n\n Some thoughts on how giraffes evolved long necks here:\n \n Note especially:\n Giraffes evolved from an ancestor that resembled a 10-foot-tall deer which was much shorter than todays 15-foot-tall species.These creatures roamed what is now Europe and Asia 30-50 million years ago (Stevens, 1993).The modern giraffe radiated on the African savanna about 1 million years ago (Simmons and Scheepers, 1996).Thesparse fossil record which is found in Europe and Asia gives some insight into the relative size of fossil giraffids (Samotherium) which show a leg length 83% that of the modern giraffe.The fossil records fail to show any parallel increase in neck length in relation to other body parts.The ancestor is thought to resemble what is today the okapi, a short four-legged mammal that also displays sexual dominance (Simmons and Scheepers, 1996).Necking must be a recently derived trait since the opaki, giraffe's closest relative, do not exemplify that behavior.\n\n And:\n \"Fossil and modern skeletal evidence should reveal a disproportionate increase in the neck length over and above expected isometric increases associated with lengthening of other body proportions\" (Simmons and Scheepers, 1996).When modern and extinct giraffids are compared this is just the case.The few fossil records suggest that fossil giraffids were stout in structure with shorter necks.\n \n When fossil records are incomplete, embryology is used to acquire morphological information about the ancestor.The ancestral character state is likely to be the character state that appears early in development (Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny).Young giraffes exhibit a leg-to-neck ratio of 1: 0.62, which reflects their ancestor who resembles the okapi with a ratio of 1: 0.44.For an adult giraffe the leg-to-neck ratio is measured to be 1: 0.93 which suggests specific selection on neck length over other body proportions.The okapi which are thought to resemble their common ancestor has a neck about 50% smaller than that of the giraffe.In further support of disproportionate elongation of the neck, skeletal studies show that a 29% disproportionate elongation takes place over the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae.Necks of the females are on average 35cm shorter than those of males because selection only acts on the males (Simmons and Scheepers, 1996).The above pieces of evidence suggest that selection has been mainly on the neck.\n\n \nAnd the mechanism of biological change is the mind. The mind, at least in higher animals, is what senses the environment and triggers the nervous system to release hormones. We know hormones play a role in turning genes On or Off. There is no reason to disbelieve that the same hormones that turn genes On or Off in the organism can do the same thing to its developing embryo....thus, evolution.\n\n \n Then how do you explain the fact that species are characterised by differences in their genomes? Evolution is more than just turning gene on or off. When you have demonstrated how one live animal can \"evolve\" into a completely different species from its parents merely by \"thinking\" itself a new pattern of gene expression, come back and we'll talk some more.

That isn't \"evolution\", it's development. Evolution is about the origin of heritable traits. Mere environmentally induced alterations in developmental pathways aren't usually heritable.

Why should anyone believe a word you say when you can't even get the basics right?\n \n http://www.chem.ucsb.edu/coursepages/archive/fall03/94-Reich/epigenetic_concepts.pdf\n \n \n ABSTRACT: We discuss the changing use of epigenetics, a term coined by\n Conrad Waddington in the 1940s, and how the epigenetic approach to development\n differs from the genetic approach. Originally, epigenetics referred\n to the study of the way genes and their products bring the\n phenotype into being. Today, it is primarily concerned with the mechanisms\n through which cells become committed to a particular form or function\n and through which that functional or structural state is then\n transmitted in cell lineages. We argue that modern epigenetics is important\n not only because it has practical significance for medicine, agriculture, and\n species conservation, but also because it has implications for the way in\n which we should view heredity and evolution. In particular, recognizing\n that there are epigenetic inheritance systems through which non-DNA\n variations can be transmitted in cell and organismal lineages broadens the\n concept of heredity and challenges the widely accepted gene-centered neo-Darwinian version of Darwinism.\n \n https://notes.utk.edu/Bio/greenberg.nsf/0/b360905554fdb7d985256ec5006a7755?OpenDocument\n \n Because a genome can pick up or shed a methyl group much more readily than it can change its DNA sequence, Jirtle says epigenetic inheritance provides a \"rapid mechanism by which [an organism] can respond to the environment without having to change its hardware.\" Epigenetic patterns are so sensitive to environmental change that, in the case of the agouti mice, they can dramatically and heritably alter a phenotype in a single generation. If you liken the genome to the hardware of a computer, Jirtle explains, then \"epigenetics is the software. It's the grey area. It's just so darn beautiful if you think about it.\" \n \n The environmental lability of epigenetic inheritance may not necessarily bring to mind Lamarckian images of giraffes stretching their necks to reach the treetops (and then giving birth to progeny with similarly stretched necks), but it does give researchers reason to reconsider long-refuted notions about the inheritance of acquired characteristics.",

Can you provide specific examples of what hormones you are talking about and what genes they are known to turn on or off? That would add considerably to the strength of your argument.

If you really believe this to be an argument you can sustain then you need at least a few demonstrable examples.

This is why when animals change the actions of genes have a way of accompanying this change -- which is simply a memory device that makes the change heritable.\n \n If so you will be hard pressed to explain why an elephant usually gives birth to another elephant instead of a baboon or an oak tree. In addition given the specific knowledge of the molecular biology of inheritance and the means by which genes are duplicated during reproduction etc you are not just out on a limb here you are like Wiley coyote running off the edge of a cliff. You have just not as of yet looked down and crashed. Please look down and get it over with. \n And sinces changes in genes are not the cause of change, genetic evolution by natural selection is a fraud....the only alternative is special creation.\n I see you are trying to develop a scientific cover for creationism. Good luck. Unfortunately you have a problem here. These days we can alter the genes in an organism in a deliberate way and demonstrate a linkage between that alteration and the subsequent changes in the organism. We can also silence a gene and show a corresponding change in the organism. There are a vast array of lines of evidence that genes and changes in genes do CAUSE changes in organisms and that changes in organisms do not cause in very many cases changes in the genes. This falsifies your core argument that genes do not have a causal relataionship to the structure and functions of organisms. emoticon_xkill",

   "I quote from SSs excerpt from the literature.\n In particular, recognizing\n that there are epigenetic inheritance systems through which non-DNA\n variations can be transmitted in cell and organismal lineages broadens the\n concept of heredity and challenges the widely accepted gene-centered neo-Darwinian version of Darwinism.\n First of all methylation patterns are like it or not changes in DNA. They are NOT non-DNA variations in any real sense of the word. The altered DNA has a different structure than the original DNA does and where this change is inherited its conceptually at least \"gene-centered\". Given that rather simple perspective then any heritability observed can (if its persistent) enter into the standard NDS context. Of course bear in mind my perspective is that of a chemist. I can see that its useful to separate out methylation patterns from main line genetics and for that purpose to consider alterations of certain bases by methylaltion to NOT be changes in the base sequence - since such changes are labile biochemically.\n \n The problem you have Supersport is that you want to make epigenetic mechanisms the SOLE pathway for variability and this just ain't so. Its one pathway to some degree of phenotypic variation, and in some cases it may even enter the process of evolution (if its persistently inherited) but the evidence for genetic inheritance via DNA is absolutely overwhelming.

Why should anyone believe a word you say when you can't even get the basics right?\n\n \n Tell me, do you ever actually, you know, read what I post? I said that epigenetic changes are usually not heritable. I didn't say such inheritance was either impossible or didn't exist. However, I am unaware that they have been implicated in speciation. I know of no studies that suggest this, merely studies that suggest that in a small handful of cases known so far, limited information about dealing with an environment can be passed on to offspring epigenetically, and persist for a few generations. \n \n There is nothing in Darwinian theory that is contradicted by that, because as I've explained, it's independent of the means of passing information from one generation to another. Darwin didn't even know what a gene was, he just assumed that information had to pass from one generation to another, by means as then undiscovered. The important feature of Darwinian theory is variance, selection and inheritance. If some of it is epigenetic rather than genetic, it doesn't alter that aspect at all, it merely says that genes alone aren't sufficient to store all relevant information, which biologists have long known -- they just hadn't understood until the last couple of decades how gene expression was controlled. Nothing contra-Darwinian there.\n \n If you know that it has been implicated in speciation, which is what Darwinian evolutionary theory deals with, let me know, with examples. Even if there are a few such examples, they would not refute evolution by natural selection, or by genetic mutation.

   "This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong.\n \n ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about \"evolution\" he's not talking about mere phenotypic change - he's talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that \"evolution\" has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered \"evolution.\" The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now:\n \n Let's take humans and dogs, for example. When compared side-by-side, sure enough, humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not - and possibly the other way around. But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs don't, does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs. Of course, there are no \"dog genes\" or \"human genes.\" But likewise there are no \"tongue genes,\" \"tail genes\" or \"toenail genes.\" Parts are not translated genes. Thus, the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible.\n \n But it's worse than that.\n \n As I said before, humans have a whole slew of genes - theoretically, at least -- that dogs (or other animals) don't have. But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms! That's why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have...But they've got it backwards! Instead, we have the genes we have because of who we are. A dog isn't a dog because he barks; a dog barks because of what he is. Same with genes.\n \n This, of course, spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.\n \n But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them. They simply won't give up because they've seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses.\n \n But here's where they're screwing everything up:\n \n When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head? If so, did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time? If so, do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head? Or, do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red? That's excactly what science is doing with genetics: they've got the audacity to claim that changes in genes (the red face) is causing the organsim to change physiologically (go upside down.) In reality, what's happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment (turning upside down) and then the genes are responding in kind (turning red).\n \n The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things:\n \n 1) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures. \n \n 2) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over.\n \n \n So there it is. Go for it.\n\n \n So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?",

   "not if their traits arise in the direction of adaptive improvement. You do believe variation can be biased in that way, right?\n\n \n Highly unlikely. How would an organism know how to bias variation, be it genetic or epigenetic, in any direction? It's clairvoyant? All it knows is its present environment, so the most it could do is attempt to suppress variation away from its local optimum. And how could it \"know\" what additional variation might be \"better\" for its local environment? These are the sort of questions it's incumbent on you to answer.\n \n An organism might make a local adaptation to an environment purely through an epigenetic change, and if, somehow, it could also fix that change in its germ cells so its progeny came epigenetically pre-adapted to deal with the same environment, then it would have a step up through natural selection on its competitors that were not able to make such epigenetic adaptations. \n \n Suppose, however, the organism guessed wrong, and the pre-adaptation wasn't successful because the environment had changed? Well, natural selection would dispose of its progeny. It's all pretty Darwinian from where I sit. You see, in Darwinian theory, if you replace \"genetic\" with \"epigenetic\" when talking about heritable traits, you don't really see much difference, because you still have the same vary-select-inherit condition.\n \n But I don't see how organisms could predict future environments to drive their progeny in the appropriate direction, genetically or epigenetically -- unless you are proposing they have evolved some sort of Tardis gene that allows them to look into the future. How, for example, does a swimming vertebrate \"know\" it's a good idea to drive its progeny in the direction of developing walking limbs rather than fish fins? It makes no sense.

   "Lesz: please notice the word random in there. I rest my case; nonrandom variation cancels out the creative role of selection.\n Nope it does no such thing. You have yet to define non-random relevant to the optimized change vector. Selection can increase fitness even if non-random changes are biased in a direction well away from the optimum change vector. Indeed the statistical angle between the population change vector and the optimum vector can exceed 90 degrees and selection will still allow for change in gene frequencies after selection to be within 90 degrees of the optimum vector.\n \n That mutations might be non-random (ie not equally probable in all directions from the population means) does not imply that such non-randomness is in any way representative of changes which will increase fitness. To show what you are claiming you wil need to demonstrate that the bias you propose IS such that without selection the population will increase in fitness. This you have failed utterly to do. Indeed I know of no studies in which such an effect has been observed. Many biologists in the past believed that mutations were in general biased in the opposite way - ie that most or many were detrimental. Thats not the consensus these days as I understand it. Les may know more than I on this subject. In any case the strict randomness of mutation has nothing of significant bearing on what Gould was discussing\n \n The fact remiains is that the only known process which can direct genetic change toward the binding of additional or more accurate information about environments is selection of heritable changes.\n \n Frankly your proposed bias as a substitute for natural selection is a non-starter of a concept unless you have substantive evidence that when the environment changes, and without selection steps, then the pattern of mutation changes so as to provide improvements in fitness under a variety of circumstances.

   "lol....oh, so now your defense has sunk to the level of \"defining non-random.\" You are one funny dude. You are no different than all the other darwinists who who try to use word games as a defense because that's all you have.\n \n The reality is nonrandom variation undermines selection. I think Gould probably knows better than you do.\n \n Gould:\n \n The central logic of Darwinism requires that natural selection not merely operate, but that it be the creative force of evolutionary change. Selection wins its role as a creative force because the other component of evolutionary mechanics - the forces that pro-duce the raw material of genetic variation - are random, in the special sense of \"not inherently directed toward adaptation.\" That is, if local environments change and smaller organisms are now at an advantage, genetic variation does not produce more small individuals, thus imparting a direction to evolutionary change from the level of variation itself. Variation continues to occur\"at random,\" in a broad spectrum about the average size. Selection must impart direction - and be the creative force of evolution - by differentially preserving those random variants yielding smaller than average phenotypes.\n \n http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/korthof63.htm\n \n Darwin's theory ... cannot be equated with the simple claim that natural selection operates. Nearly all his colleagues and predecessors accepted this postulate. Darwin, in his characteristic and radical way, grasped that this standard mechanism for preserving the type could be inverted, and then converted into the primary cause of evolutionary change. Natural selection obviously lies at the center of Darwin's theory, but we must recognize, as Darwin's second key postulate, that claim that natural selection acts as the creative force of evolutionary change. The essence of Darwinism cannot reside in the mere observation that natural selection operates -- for everyone had long accepted a negative role for natural selection in eliminating the unfit and preserving the type. (Gould 2002: 139) \n \n (....) We have lost this context and distinction today, and our current perspective often hampers an understanding of the late 19th century literature and its preoccupations. Anyone who has read deeply in this literature knows that no argument inspired more discussion, while no Darwinian claim seemed more vulnerable to critics, than the proposition that natural selection should be viewed as a positive force, and therefore as the primary cause of evolutionary change. The \"creativity of natural selection\" -- the phrase generally used in Darwin's time as a shorthand description of the problem -- set the cardinal subject for debate about evolutionary mechanisms during Darwin's lifetime and throughout the late 19th century. [It is poised to once again become the central question due to the amazing scientific discoveries taking place in evo-devo.] (Gould 2002: 139) \n \n Non-Darwinian evolutionists did not deny the reality, or the operationality, of natural selection as a genuine cause stated in the most basic or abstract manner. (....) They held, rather, that natural selection, as a headsman or executioner, could only eliminate the unfit, while some other cause must play the positive role of constructing the fit. (Gould 2002: 139) \n \n (....) We can understand the trouble that Darwin's contemporaries experienced in comprehending how selection could work as a creative force when we confront the central paradox of Darwin's crucial argument: natural selection makes nothing; it can only choose among variants originating by other means. How then can selection possibly be conceived as a \"progressive,\" or \"creative,\" or \"positive\" force? (Gould 2002: 140) \n \n The Requirements for Variation \n \n In order to act as raw material only, variation must walk a tightrope between two unacceptable alternatives. first and foremost, variation must exist in sufficient amounts, for natural selection can make nothing, and must rely upon bounty thus provided; but variation must not be too florid or showy either, lest it become the creative agent of change itself. Variation, in short, must be copious, small in extent, and undirected. A full taxonomy of non-Darwinian evolutionary theories may be elaborated by their denials of one or more of these central assumptions. (Gould 2002: 141) \n \n COPIOUS. Since natural selection makes nothing and can only work with raw material presented to its stringent review, variation must be generated in copious and dependable amounts.... Darwin's scenario for selective modification always includes the postulate, usually stated explicitly, that all structures vary, and therefore evolve.... If these universally recognized distinctions arise as consequences of differences in the intrinsic capacity of species to vary, then Darwin's key postulate of copiousness would be compromised -- for failure of sufficient raw material would then be setting a primary limit upon the rate and style of evolutionary change, and selection would not occupy the driver's seat. (Gould 2002: 141-142) \n \n Darwin responds by denying this interpretation, and arguing that differing intensities of selection, rather than intrinsically distinct capacities for variation, generally cause the greater or lesser differentiation observed among domestic species. I regard this argument as among the most forced and uncomfortable in the Origin -- a rare example of Darwinian special pleading. But Darwin realizes the centrality of copiousness to his argument for the creativity of natural selection, and he must therefore face the issue directly: \n \n Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds for the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people and little attention paid to their breeding; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt the display of distinct breeds (p. 42). \n \n Second, copiousness must also be asserted in the face of a powerful argument about limits to variation following modal departure from \"type.\" To use Fleeming Jenkin's (1867) famous analogy: a species may be compared to a rigid sphere, with modal morphology of individuals at the center, and limits to variation defined by the surface. So long as individuals lie near the center, variation will be copious in all directions [isotropic; non-directional]. But if selection brings the mode to the surface, then further variation in the same direction will cease -- and evolution will be stymied by an intrinsic limitation upon raw material, even when selection would favor further movement. Evolution, in other words, might consume its own fuel and bring itself to an eventual halt thereby. This potential refutation stood out as especially serious -- not only for threatening the creativity of natural selection, but also for challenging the validity of uniformitarian extrapolation as a methodology of research. Darwin responded, as required by logical necessity, that such limits do not exist, and that new spheres of equal radius can be reconstructed around new modes: \"No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification\" (p. 8). (Gould 2002: 142) \n \n (....) One of the most appealing features of Mendalism a strong reason for acceptance following its \"rediscovery\" in 1900 lay in the argument that mutation could restore variation \"used up\" by selection. (Gould 2002: 143) \n \n [See Klein & Tanaka, 2002, \"Where Do We Come From: The Molecular Evidence for Human Descent,\" p. 197-204, regarding atavism.] \n \n SMALL IN EXTENT. If the variations that yielded evolutionary change were large -- producing new major features, or even new taxa in a single step then natural selection would not disappear as an evolutionary force. Selection would still function in an auxiliary and negative role as headsman -- to heap up the hecatomb of the unfit, permit new saltation to spread among organisms in subsequent generations, and eventually to take over the population. But Darwinism, as a theory of evolutionary change, would perish -- for selection would become both subsidiary and negative, and variation itself would emerge as the primary, and truly creative, force of evolution, the source of occasionally lucky saltation. For this reason, the quite properly, saltationist (or macromutational) theories have always been viewed as anti-Darwinian -- despite the protestations of de Vries ..., who tried to retain the Darwinian label for his continued support of selection as a negative force. The unthinking, knee-jerk response of many orthodox Darwinians whenever they hear the word \"rapid\" or the name \"Goldschmidt,\" testifies to the conceptual power of saltation as a cardinal danger to an entire theoretical edifice. (Gould 2002: 143) \n \n Darwin held firmly to the credo of small-scale variability as raw material because both poles of his great accomplishment required this proviso.... At the theoretical pole, natural selection can only operate in a creative manner if its cumulating force builds adaptation step by step from an isotropic pool of small-scale variability. If the primary source of evolutionary innovation must be sought in the occasional luck of fortuitous saltations, then internal forces of variation become the creative agents of change, and natural selection can only help to eliminate the unfit after the fit arise by some other process. (Gould 2002: 143-142) \n \n (....) \n \n UNDIRECTED. Textbooks of evolution still often refer to variation as \"random.\" We all recognize this designation is a misnomer, but continue to use the phrase by force of habit. Darwinians have never argued for \"random\" mutation in the restricted and technical sense of \"equally likely in all directions,\" as in tossing a die. [Rather it means statistical frequencies around a modal norm, like the bell curve for example, which does not imply that the underlying cause is totally random like tossing die.] But our sloppy use of \"random\" (see Eble, 1999) does capture, at least in a vernacular sense, the essence of the important claim that we do wish to convey -- namely, that variation must be unrelated to the direction of evolutionary change; or, more strongly, that nothing about the process of creating raw material biases the pathway of subsequent change in adaptive directions. This fundamental postulate gives Darwinism its \"two step\" character, the \"chance\" and \"necessity\" of Monad's famous formulation the separation of a source of raw material (mutation, recombination, etc.) from a force of change (natural selection). (Gould 2002: 144) \n \n In a sense, the specter of directed variability threatens Darwinism even more seriously than any putative failure of the other two postulates. Insufficient variation stalls natural selection; saltation deprives selection of a creative role but still calls upon Darwin's mechanism as a negative force. With directed variation, however, natural selection can be bypassed entirely. If adaptive pressures automatically trigger heritable variation in favored directions, then trends can proceed under regimes of random mortality; natural selection, acting as a negative force, can, at most, accelerate the change. (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n (....) Darwin clearly understood the threat of directed variability to his cardinal postulate of creativity for natural selection. He explicitly restricted the sources of variation to auxiliary roles as providers of raw material, and granted all power over the direction of evolutionary change to natural selection.... He recognized biased tendencies to certain states of variation, particularly reversions toward ancestral features. But he viewed such tendencies as weak and easily overcome by selection. Thus, by the proper criterion of relative power and frequency, selection controls the direction of change: \"When under nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved\" (p. 15) (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n We may summarize Darwin's third requirement for variation under the rubric of isotropy, a common term in mineralogy (and other sciences) for the concept of a structure or system that exhibits no preferred pathway as a consequence of construction with equal properties in all directions. Darwinian variation must be copious in amount, small in extent, and effectively isotropic. (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n (....) Only under these stringent conditions can natural selection -- a force that makes nothing directly, and must rely upon variation for all raw material -- be legitimately regarded as creative. (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n (....) Gradualism. Selection becomes creative only if it can impart direction to evolution by superintending the slow and steady accumulation of favored subsets from an isotropic pool of variation. If gradualism does not accompany this process of change, selection must relinquish this creative role and Darwinism then fails as a creative source of evolutionary novelty. If important new features, or entire new taxa, arise as large and discontinuous variations, then creativity lies in the production of the variation itself. Natural selection no longer causes evolution, and can only act as a headsman for the unfit, thus promoting changes that originated in other ways. Gradualism therefore becomes a logical consequence of the operation of natural selection in Darwin's creative mode. (Gould 2002: 149) \n \n \n Yeap...gould agrees with me.
