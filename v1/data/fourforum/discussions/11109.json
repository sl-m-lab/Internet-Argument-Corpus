Did they all run off or give up the fight?\nCould it be that they've finally realized that there is no viable argument for gun control in a country that was built on freedom to bear arms?\n \n Each time the control-lobby comes up with an argument....they get shot to pieces. (Laugh out loud!)\n \n It is interesting to note that both of the Democratic front-runners for 2008 favor gun control. With the recent death of Charlton Heston, there's a weakness in the armor of the NRA.\n \n I would go on a handgun buying spree, but I already have enough guns and ammo to stave off a thousand or so government guntakers at a place we call \"the Little Alamo\".",
