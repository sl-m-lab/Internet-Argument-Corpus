Either that, or you are totally ignorant of what socialism is. I suspect your side is just being dishonest though because I know you aren't stupid. Alaska's oil-profit distribution program takes the money which Oil Companies pay it for every barrel of Alaska Oil they remove and returns that income to the people of Alaska who are the true shareholders of the States Natural Resources. These payments are not comparable to socialism at all because Alaska requires the state's resource wealth to be shared with residents, but it's not taxing personal income. \n \n Name for me any socialist system which returns government money back to the people rather than the other way around? True socialism would keep that money and not even apply it towards the individuals tax bill for credit that it was their money originally, and they would tax the people anyway. \n \n The dishonesty of this article is understandable, knowing how low the ethical standards of the Extreme Left is, but what should embarrass you is that you are dishonest enough to promote such a twisted and inaccurate interpretation of socialism as you infer that Alaska is practicing it at all..",

When Chavez Nationalized it's Oil Industry, an American Oil Company, (Shell, I THINK) pulled out of the Country. And is Chavez returning a percentage of the Oil revenues to his citizens in the form of a check? Not on your life. It goes into the National coffers and is going to build up the military. THAT'S SOCIALISM. What is happening in Alaska, and has happened there since Oil was first drilled there back in the 80s I might add, (Palin didn't create this concept or this fund) isn't socialism at all. It is redistribution of Alaska's natural resource revenues to its rightful shareholders, the citizens of the State.",

Muthee listed most of them: business and finance, schools and education, media and entertainment, politics and government.\n \n Muthee also stated \"The Bible says the wealth of the wicked is stored up for the righteous. Sarah Palin was in the audience. Minutes later, she was anointed, and blessed, with the laying on of hands.\n \n Thomas Muthee is an internationally known celebrity in the New Apostolic Reformation and a personal friend of the movement's head, C. Peter Wagner. In June 2006 Wagner proclaimed that \"God has declared through His prophets that the wealth of the wicked will be released to the Kingdom of God,\" and declared, threateningly, \"the enemies' camp will be plundered.\"\n \n The New Apostolic Reformation is not a small movement: an apostle of C. Peter Wagner, one of the 500 apostles in Wagner's International Coalition of Apostles, owns what will be one of the tallest buildings in the world, the Jakarta Tower. One of the NAR's branches is successfully supplanting the Catholic Church in Brazil. The movement holds international conferences on advancing Christian hegemony in the business sector [link to PDF].\n \n At the end of this post I've added the nine minute video in which Thomas Muthee urges \"infiltration\" of key sectors of society and then blesses and anoints Sarah Palin as a political leader. In other videos I've also added, leaders in the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) describe and promote the same agenda for Christian theocratic takeover as did Muthee: the The Seven Mountains Mandate, in which seven key sectors of society are targeted for takeover.\n \n Two top leaders in the New Apostolic Reformation, directors of \"Spiritual Warfare\" networks who hold other high level positions in the NAR are now definitively tied to Sarah Palin: at her entrance into politics at 24 and her emergence onto the national stage, as Alaska governor, in late 2006. There is considerable circumstantial evidence for the case that Sarah Palin is still in Mary Glazier's prayer warrior / spiritual warfare network. \n A new 36 page report ( read online / PDF file / some of the highlights of the report ), from an independent research team that has specialized in studying Sarah Palin's faith, contains ground breaking information on a religious movement Sarah Palin is tied to and which advocates that its members \"plunder\" the wealth of the \"godless\". Bruce Wilson: Palin's Movement Urges 'Godly' To 'Plunder' Wealth of The 'Godless'\n Hey. If we modify Obama's plan from \"redistributing the wealth\" to \"redistributing the wealth of the *godless* to the *godly*, will the Republicans agree?\n :rolls",

The dishonesty which you represent is reflected in every aspect of your personal world view, so I'm not surprised that that same dishonesty is projected through all of the anti-christian propaganda you spew. Here are some undeniable facts regarding his pro-socialist beliefs.\n Odinga Made A Deal with Kenyan Muslims to Institute Islamic Law; Obama Campaigned for Him\n [Update: As a reader pointed out, Sharia is an assault on women.]\n \n The video below tells a shocking story of Barack Obama's involvement, while a US Senator, in the Presidential campaign of Raila Odinga.\n \n Now that Obama has acknowledged having had Kenyan citizenship, it's time to take another serious look at his recent campaign activities on behalf of Kenyan presidential candidate Raila Odinga, a Muslim sympathizer and leader of the socialist Orange Democratic Movement.\n \n We review the Obama-Odinga campaign collaboration with this central question in mind: As a former Kenyan citizen, does Obama's open involvement in Kenyan presidential politics raise troubling questions about his loyalties? Apparently Obama traveled to Kenya on official business as a US Senator; the trip was funded by US taxpayers. Odinga's policy positions were against stated US interests.\n \n Odinga, running on the slogan \"Agent of Change,\" lost the race for President of Kenya in December 2007 and thereafter led a campaign of widespread ethnic warfare in protest of his loss.\n \n In August 2007, Odinga had signed an agreement with Islamic extremists to institute Islamic Law should he be elected President of Kenya, and he vowed to end cooperation with the United States in the war against terror. WHY did OBAMA actively campaign for him?\n \n The TD Blog initiated a review of the Constitutional problems related to Barack Obama's dual citizenship. His activities in Kenya illustrate how dual citizenship can create divided loyalties and thus disqualify a candidate for Commander-in-Chief of the United States. [Incidentally, this is also a clear-cut violation of the Logan Act -- see our article in the Reference List at the end.]\n \n This central question is now being litigated by Philip J. Berg. Whether or not Berg's case prevails on the procedural issues of standing and jurisdiction - the issue of dual citizenship must eventually be reviewed by the federal courts. In the event that Obama gets elected, I predict that this legal problem will ultimately end his presidency. What a shame that he's been so secretive and deceptive about his past. By the way, in case you are unfamiliar with our work, led by in-house researcher and scholar \"Judah Benjamin,\" we maintain that Obama's Indonesian citizenship could still be active.Why Did Obama Campaign for a Pro-Islam Candidate in Kenya? [UPDATE] td blog\n \n YouTube - Barack Obama in Kenya supporting Raila Odinga and Violence\n Watch the video. It's 8 minutes long. The first 6 minutes give an excellent overview of Odinga's bid for President and his socialist background. Obama's role in Odinga's candidacy begins at approximately 6:20. It is truly stunning and something that every American voter MUST SEE: \n \n Now, I realize I'm wasting my time even attempting to reason with the likes of you foundit, but let me ask you a question in order to send this message home. If I was running for a public office and asked you to campaign for me in the gay community, would you do it for me since we agree on absolutely nothing regarding your definition of what gay rights are compared to my definition? Of course you wouldn't do anything to help me, whom you believe to be a philosophical enemy, to gain a public office which I could use to work against your interests.\n \n Yet you wont apply the same rationale to Obama as he endorses and campaigns for his socialist and pro islamic cousin. Why would Obama ever campaign for Odinga unless he agreed with what he represented? The answer is, like you, he wouldn't. Now come on back with your typical claims that I just don't get it as you prove your hypocrisy, double standards and lack of consistency once again as you deny what you have seen with your own eyes. :xbanghead",
