You gave up yours a long time ago as well as your rights and has caused continued suffering and mal-law.\n \n Our government is charged with 3 things: protection of property, preservation of contracts and provide for the RULE OF LAW. If you give up that law then anything following is completely worthless as your conglomerate has demonstrated repeatedly. After all this time, your gun bans are worthless as crime control or gun control either for that matter.\n \n It may make you seem \"morally superior\" but self-defense by death is hardly superior to anything except growth of government and death by the same.\n \n The veneer of society is very thin. Look at Haiti which used to be an agrarian society but now depends on the largress of national aid and lack of lumber which was denuded from the island by mainly the UN and digressed into one of the most poorly governed nations in the world.\n \n Even in the U.S., only about 2% produce food and clothing for the remaining 98%...can you say \"fragile\"? The U.K. is no better off and maybe worse off. You can pretend government is the one that feeds you but that is simply a fallacy. I would go so far as to say that government creates criminals and crime to keep you dependant so of course you don't want to acknowledge that! Once that thin veneer breaks, you are on your own just like Haiti or the victims of Katrina...and government by largress which is proven not to work as claimed. Once you give up those inalienable rights to rule yourself and be a productive member of society you have already lost your moral compass and are but another tax eater and not a producer who not only feeds you but pays for other welfare and you are nothing but a dependant.\n \n Once you dismiss the rule of law, no law appears too ridiculous. Congrats on reaching that stage of societal collapse. emoticon_xclown then you can clap when a farmer, an independent who produces far more than any criminal is persecuted and prosecuted for defending his rightful possessions and property. You have no moral compass nor set of laws to rely on but depend on largess of tax eaters to feed and cloth you and make legal decisions based on personal feelings and whims of daft people who put them in office. Your faith is misplaced as are your laws and morals. Like the serpant with Adam and Eve, you tempt folks by pretending to offer them something they already have but you want them to give up to satisfy your misguided whim.\n \n I am glad you are not armed, tax feeders get vicious when thwarted. All a person has to do if they are opposed to the Constitution and the 2A right to self defense is to refuse to own a gun. Good on ya! They don't have to convince nor force those who do maintain their rights to change just because your feeling of superiority keeps your nose up in the air so you can't even see where your next step will be...and you keep stepping in IT.",
