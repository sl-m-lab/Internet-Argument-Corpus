If the person seeks Jesus and Jesus doesn't reveal himself to this person, how is this the person's fault?\n Really, you're pulling the no-true-Scotsman fallacy: If you didn't find, then you didn't truly seek.\n \n \nthese are biblical directions to carry out the formula of sincere seeking.\n\n So you have to believe in the Biblical directions in order to have reason to believe in Biblical directions?

A willingness to review your opinion based off new evidence - using the bible as the sole basis on whether an action is right or wrong (as in the case of homosexuality) clearly shows you can not be open minded on the topic as you refuse to accept that there is/or even will ever be any additional evidence to weigh up.\n \n On the otherhand, I don't think atheism is not open minded toward the existance of god - should new evidence appear that makes it clear and obvious that there is a god then most would be willing to change their mind. However just because new evidence to consider does appear (such as testamonials from converts) doesn't mean that still refusing to accept the existance of god reveals you to be closeminded on the topic, the evidence just isn't good enough as it doesn't stand up to contradictory evidence or can be explained away by other means.",
