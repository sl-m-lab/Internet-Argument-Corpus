Right?\" \n \n He was being sarcastic, but understand what he was saying. \n \n Yes, it is criminal what they are proposing. It's criminal to remove kids from loving, safe homes and continue to bounce them throughout the system which very likely will simply loose them in the end. It's criminal to traumatize children who maybe for the first times in their lives know what it means to be loved, regardless of where they came from or what problems they might have. \n \n Let's face it, the foster care system, in every state, is over crowded and over burdoned with fewer and fewer families willing to foster in general. Why deny caring gay couples/families from helping these kids who really need it? \n I just don't get it. But..it doesn't suprise me. \n \n It's Texas after all.",

I've heard that 40 percent of foster children are placed with gay families.\n\n \n From what I'm finding out and reading, I tend to agree with you that there doesn't seem to be any recorded or statistical effects on kids under gay foster care. The only thing there is to go on is observable effects that could be noted in reports or stats. \n \n I suspect a lot of the reason that gay foster care is opposed is that it is a.) used as an activism tool by the gay lobby IMO, and b.) it tends to be another way for the gay movement to come across as normal and and a benign everyday thing--as valid as any family arrangement. One can agree or disagree, but either way I suspect those reasons are why it is mostly opposed. And there is probably some degree of belief out there that it's a bad influence on the kids under their care. Homosexual behavior is still viewed very much as a lifestyle, even though there's no doubt that gay lobbyists HATE that characterization. \n \n But I don't see any real-world reason to oppose kids under gay foster care, at this point. It seems to me that it's still going to be better than kids being out on the street for them to get shelter, care, and love regardless of the private or not-so-private behavior of the caretakers. No matter how one looks at this, kids are always going to be better off like that, right? It seems to me that all the concerns about activism, the gay lifestyle, and homosexuality coming across as a legitimate way of life pales in importance when compared to the needs of kids who simply need a home. I think the kids should be put first.\n \n So I'm with you on this one.",

What's not normal about caring for a child's well being? \n What's not normal about opening your home to a child in need? \n \n See, that's what those who are opposing gays as foster parents seem to forget.

Is the child recieving positive reenforcement? Does the child have a safe roof over their head? \n Is the child being taught values and respect for others as well as him/herself? Is the child getting an appropriate education? Is the child being given tools to make rational decissions and good choices? \n \n These are what SHOULD be the issues, insted of this **** about what gender the foster parents are. \n \n My son is my biological child, I would fight tooth and nail to retain my RIGHT as his mother, to continue to care for my child!\n The only difference between myself and a foster parent is that there is no biological tie.

Why are you using this thread and VOR's posts to give an unrelated bashing on homeschooling? What does that have to do with anything?\n \n Just to set the record straight . . .\n \n \"The stereotypical home-schooled child is often portrayed as being shy, passive, and lethargic because of his/her isolation from the normal socialization found in formal schooling. Critics further allege that the self-concept of the home-schooled child suffers from lack of exposure to a more conventional environment (Stough, 1992). Another socialization-related accusation faced by home educators is that of overprotecting their children from the real world. If this is true, however, at least one researcher (Bliss, 1989) does not consider this to be a serious problem. She argues that \"Protection during early, developmental years for purposes of nurturing and growth is evident in many arenas: plant, animal, and aquatic. Why should it be considered wrong or bad in the most vital arena, human development?\" Stough (1992),looking particularly at socialization, compared 30 home-schooling families and 32 conventionally schooling families, families with children 7-14 years of age. According to the findings, children who were schooled at home \"gained the necessary skills, knowledge, and attitudes needed to function in society...at a rate similar to that of conventionally schooled children.\" The researcher found no difference in the self concept of children in the two groups. Stough maintains that \"insofar as self concept is a reflector of socialization, it would appear that few home-schooled children are socially deprived, and that there may be sufficient evidence to indicate that some home-schooled children have a higher self concept than conventionally schooled children.\" This echoes the findings of Taylor (1987). Using one of the best validated self-concept scales available, Taylor's random sampling of home-schooled children (45,000) found that half of these children scored at or above the 91st percentile--47% higher than the average, conventionally schooled child. He concludes: \"Since self concept is considered to be a basic dynamic of positive sociability, this answers the often heard skepticism suggesting that home schoolers are inferior in socialization\"(Taylor, 1987). From the findings of these two studies, it would appear that the concerns expressed by teachers, administrators, and legislators about socialization and home schooling might be unfounded.\"\n \n http://www.ericdigests.org/1995-1/home.htm",

   "I suspect a lot of the reason that gay foster care is opposed is that it is a.) used as an activism tool by the gay lobby IMO,\n\n \n People become activists because their rights to look after and love a child are taken away.\n \n \nand b.) it tends to be another way for the gay movement to come across as normal and and a benign everyday thing--as valid as any family arrangement.\n\n \n You could say that any family wants to come across as normal, and just be left alone and not face prejudice of any sort.\n \n \nOne can agree or disagree, but either way I suspect those reasons are why it is mostly opposed. And there is probably some degree of belief out there that it's a bad influence on the kids under their care. Homosexual behavior is still viewed very much as a lifestyle, even though there's no doubt that gay lobbyists HATE that characterization.\n\n \n And all of this is based on what? Facts? Of course not, it's all based on prejudice. Why wouldn't any group of people \"lobby\", against prejudice and discrimination used against them and their families? \n \n \nBut I don't see any real-world reason to oppose kids under gay foster care, at this point.\n\n \n Very good.\n \n \nIt seems to me that it's still going to be better than kids being out on the street for them to get shelter, care, and love regardless of the private or not-so-private behavior of the caretakers. No matter how one looks at this, kids are always going to be better off like that, right? It seems to me that all the concerns about activism, the gay lifestyle, and homosexuality coming across as a legitimate way of life pales in importance when compared to the needs of kids who simply need a home. I think the kids should be put first.\n \n So I'm with you on this one.\n\n \n I'm glad you understand the importance of putting the child first. However, you should also understand that people become activists in this way because they genuinly want to love a child. There may be a structure of other activists that will help fight for their rights, here, and in other areas. Those activists and the political solidarity among many gay people, all exists, due to the lack of equal rights. This is how we get our rights. It would be nice if, like the majority, we could just take those rights for granted, and not have to fight for them.",

   "The \"family values\" crowd in Texas has been searching far and wide for some research to make their support of an amendment to the Child Protective Services bill that would ban gays and bisexuals from being foster parents in Texas seem like a valiant defense of the innocence of children. There is nothing more fascinating than watching someone on the Christian Right attempt to use science to validate an argument, as though religion and science have suddenly learned to get along and stop quarreling over petty issues like the origin of life on Earth.\n \n Hallelujah! The Texas Eagle Forum has found a scientist that hates gays just as much as they do. Even better, he works for their friends at the Family Research Institute. Now all they have to do is disregard all the research that doesn't suit their needs. Not to worry, Cathie Adams is on the ball. \n \n To arrive at the assertion that \"children in same-sex couple homes are 11 times more likely to be abused sexually,\" Cathie Adams, of the Texas Eagle Forum, derived her numbers from two unrelated studies and mongrelized them with the findings of a researcher by the name of Paul Cameron. Cameron, of the ultraconservative Family Research Institute, had published a report that was itself a hybrid of several other studies. In it, he concluded that \"homosexual practitioners were proportionately more apt to sexually abuse foster or adoptive children.\" \n \n No single step that Cameron took to reach his findings is grounds for immediate dismissal of his claims. Rather, there are many small, but important, aspects of the research that, together, warrant the \"junk science\" label and have led many to dispute the legitimacy of his findings. The biggest logical fallacy Cameron commits is equating pedophilia with adult homosexuality by interpreting statistics that show that 34 percent of sexual abuse in foster homes is committed by a guardian of the same sex. Cameron fails to show any relationship with same-sex pedophilia and adult homosexuality, which is a crucial misstep. The assumption that every adult that touches a minor of the same sex considers him or herself a homosexual or is sexually attracted to adults of the same sex is ridiculous. Even more important is that Illinois, the state Cameron analyzed, does not keep data regarding the sexual preference of foster parents, so he was forced to use national data to reach conclusions about a study with an extremely limited scope. \n \n When vocal activists conduct research, their conclusions will be generally dismissed as agenda-driven and unsound, especially if the methods are questionable. When Cameron's report got into the hands of Cathie Adams, who utilized fifth-grade math skills to reach her own conclusion about Cameron's findings, a study that was bad to begin with was stripped of what little merit it had left and regurgitated as propaganda. Adams' \"11 times\" claim contains an obviously glaring flaw. She assumes that everyone that commits sexual abuse with a minor of the same sex is in a homosexual partnership, or \"household.\" In fact, nothing supports this assertion, and after making the unfounded claim on CNN, Adams told The Wall Street Journal, \"It just requires more explanation than what you can do in sound bites.\" How convenient. \n \n A far more comprehensive report, published by the American Psychological Association, analyzed the findings of a multitude of studies conducted over the last 50 years and concluded that the hysteria over same-sex foster parents is completely unfounded. The Texas Eagle Forum doesn't quote that study.\n \n It is clear that the personal belief that certain Americans lack the qualifications to raise children does not mix well with the empirical nature of science, or the U.S. Constitution. The existence of a fringe study to support an extreme viewpoint does not even come close to validating a belief. If every ridiculous attempt to scientifically prove the existence of UFOs or deny the Holocaust was taken seriously, the world would be a very different place. Luckily, the scientific community utilizes exhaustive peer-review and analytical methods to keep sub-standard research out of the overall body of knowledge. \n \n The Texas Eagle Forum resurrected a study that failed to survive the rigors of scientific scrutiny, added their own spin, and ignored all evidence to the contrary - all to masquerade as an organization with legitimate concerns grounded in scientific data, instead of bigotry. \n http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2005/05/03/Opinion/AntiGay.Advocates.Abuse.Scientific.Facts-946615.shtml",
