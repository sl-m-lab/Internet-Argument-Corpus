Republicans tend to think that anyone accused in a domestic court is guilty, and liberals tend to think that anyone of the military accused is guilty.

Their appeals can be based on court procedure even though the violation of procedures has nothing to do with their guilt or innocence.

Perfection arises from perfect, and imperfection arises from imperfection, you'd expect a imperfect creation to create a imperfect system. Violation of court precedures? Obviously you still don't understand the system. A significent amount of death row inmates have been exonerated on finding of incompetent/drunk/high lawyers, racial prejudice, hidden or recent evidence, and other such non-court violations. \n \n \n\n Now that we have refined the evidence verification methods, there should be fewer false convictions.\n\n \n Hardly perfect. DNA samples are by no ways perfect, and contaimination of samples occurs on a regular basis. There is a reason one DNA sample cannot condemn a man. \n \n Sure the system is flawed, but it's better then executing off innocent people, which would be the outcome of your system.",

   "DNA evidence is hardly enough to send someone to row. DNA samples are easily contaminted by a number of various things, one being other people's DNA. As for forcing appeals to occur within a limited time, that is unlikely. Our system today is backlogged to a serious degree, and forcing more expensive, time consuming cases into a system that can't handle them normally is a bad idea. \n\n Thank you. That's why I had the ? after DNA evidence. I really didn't know how well DNA evidence works in court. \n \n \n \nThat doesn't ensure that we don't end up murdering innocent people. What is more important: ensureing that we don;t kill innocent people or saving money?\n\n Making sure we don't kill innocents is obviously more important. However, allowing appeals to drag on for over ten years seems to be a little extreme. It seems we could save a lot of money by forcing appeals to be made within a few years of the origional conviction with little risk of convicting an innocent.\n Again though, I really don't know as much as I should about how our court system works, so please correct me again if I'm wrong.",

DNA is the best thing since apple pie in criminal investigations for the proving of guilt process , ( except in ONE famous case :( ) The only drawback is, at what point will it get to come in to play before the jury's decision, if ever ? . Those that do not have the funds for expert counsel or that do not have outside support like diligent family members with extra time on their hands, will never get the DNA tests to prove or disprove the accused person's case. jmo",

We've relinquished so many civil rights through the Patiot Act that if the current lack of due cause requirement was combined with reduced appeals one has given the government carte blanche to operate as even more of a police state.",

   "Thank you. That's why I had the ? after DNA evidence. I really didn't know how well DNA evidence works in court.\n\n \n It's not a enough, and shouldn't be. The courts have realized that a number of evidences pieces shouldn't be allowed alone to condemn a person. They stopped letting a single testimony do it a while ago, after they realized, well, testimonies can be falsified, wrong, or subjective to the mood of the person. It actually takes a lot to send a person to death row. \n \n \n\n Making sure we don't kill innocents is obviously more important. However, allowing appeals to drag on for over ten years seems to be a little extreme. It seems we could save a lot of money by forcing appeals to be made within a few years of the origional conviction with little risk of convicting an innocent.\n\n \n The fact that killing people as a means of punishment seems a bit extreme. However, a decade is not necessarily a bad thing. We didn't have major forensics to exonerate people a decade ago. Sure we have some primitive stuff, but nothing like today which is freeing a significent chunk of the inmates nation wide. Who knows what we'll have in 10 more years? Considering the past, it seems foolhardly to give them only a few years to do appeal. But then again, considering how this society glorifies violenence...who knows? \n \n \n\n Again though, I really don't know as much as I should about how our court system works, so please correct me again if I'm wrong.\n\n \n See above. there's a big problem with how capital punishment cases are tried, but our system is alot better then most. Saudi Arabia they often torture innocnet people to make false confessions and then kill them. Jim favors this system, heaven knows why, but remember, there is always someone worse.",
