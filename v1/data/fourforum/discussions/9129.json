If all the priests, religious leaders of all faiths, and any one who leads crusades against homosexuals were outed. We could fill a telephone book with the names. \n It's well know that many of those that speak out so adamantly against homosexuals have homosexual tendencies themselves. It makes me sick, what cowards. Then they claim to stand for morals and values. Honesty would be in there wouldn't it? \n \n \n \n A leading evangelist and outspoken opponent of gay marriage has given up his post as president of the National Association of Evangelicals while a church panel investigates allegations he paid a man for sex.\n \n The Rev. Ted Haggard resigned as head of the 30 million-member association Thursday and also gave up leadership of his New Life Church pending the investigation into allegations he had monthly trysts with a gay prostitute over the past three years.\n \n Haggard, a married father of five, denied the allegations, but the acting pastor of his church later said that Haggard had acknowledged some of the accusations were true.\n \n \"I just know that there has been some admission of indiscretion, not admission to all of the material that has been discussed, but there is an admission of some guilt,\" Ross Parsley told KKTV-TV of Colorado Springs.\n \n Parlsey did not elaborate, but in an e-mail addressed to congregants, he wrote that the church's four-member board of overseers had since met with Haggard.\n \n \"It is important for you to know that he confessed to the overseers that some of the accusations against him are true. He has willingly and humbly submitted to the authority of the board of overseers, and will remain on administrative leave during the course of the investigation,\" the e-mail stated. A copy was obtained by KMGH-TV in Denver.\n \n Late Wednesday, Haggard told KUSA-TV: \"I've never had a gay relationship with anybody, and I'm steady with my wife, I'm faithful to my wife.\"\n \n The allegations surfaced as voters in Colorado and seven other states get ready to decide Tuesday on amendments banning gay marriage. Besides the proposed ban on the Colorado ballot, a separate measure would establish the legality of domestic partnerships providing same-sex couples with many of the rights of married couples.\n \n Members of Haggard's 14,000-member megachurch were stunned.\n \n \"It's political, right before the elections,\" said Brian Boals, a New Life member for 17 years.\n \n Church member E.J. Cox, 25, called the claims \"ridiculous.\"\n \n \"People are always saying stuff about Pastor Ted,\" she said. \"You just sort of blow it off. He's just like anyone else in the public eye.\"\n \n The accusations were made by Mike Jones, 49, of Denver, who said he decided to go public because of the political fight over the amendments.\n \n \"I just want people to step back and take a look and say, 'Look, we're all sinners, we all have faults, but if two people want to get married, just let them, and let them have a happy life,'\" said Jones, who added that he isn't working for any political group.\n \n Jones, who said he is gay, said he was also upset when he discovered Haggard and the New Life Church had publicly opposed same-sex marriage.\n \n \"It made me angry that here's someone preaching about gay marriage and going behind the scenes having gay sex,\" he said.\n \n Jones claimed Haggard paid him to have sex nearly every month over three years. He said he advertised himself as an escort on the Internet and was contacted by a man who called himself Art, who snorted methamphetamine before their sexual encounters to heighten his experience.\n \n Jones said he later saw the man on television identified as Haggard and that the two last had sex in August. \n \n He said he has voice mail messages from Haggard, as well as an envelope he said Haggard used to mail him cash. He declined to make the voice mails available to the AP, but KUSA-TV reported what it said were excerpts late Thursday that referred to methamphetamine. \n \n \"Hi Mike, this is Art,\" one call began, according to the station. \"Hey, I was just calling to see if we could get any more. Either $100 or $200 supply.\" \n \n A second message, left a few hours later, began: \"Hi Mike, this is Art, I am here in Denver and sorry that I missed you. But as I said, if you want to go ahead and get the stuff, then that would be great. And I'll get it sometime next week or the week after or whenever.\" \n \n Haggard, 50, was appointed president of the evangelicals association in March 2003. He has participated in conservative Christian leaders' conference calls with White House staffers and lobbied members of Congress last year on U.S. Supreme Court appointees after Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement. \n \n After Massachusetts legalized gay marriage in 2004, Haggard and others began organizing state-by-state opposition. Last year, Haggard and officials from the nearby Christian ministry Focus on the Family announced plans to push Colorado's gay marriage ban for the 2006 ballot. \n \n At the time, Haggard said that he believed marriage is a union between a man and woman rooted in centuries of tradition, and that research shows it's the best family unit for children.",

His actions cause a great deal of harm. He is a pustule of a preacher, who incidentally is purported to have the ear of W with a weekly conference call. \n\n \n The fact that he believes that gay sex is wrong and his own sexuality (assuming he's gay) are two completely separate factors in terms of whether it's hypocritical or not. It's not uncommon for someone who has struggled with a vice* in the past to take up opposition to it as sort of a mission, or goal. That said, it's not entirely surprising that someone in that situation would slip up from time to time. It's the same thing we sometimes see that an alcoholic would take up the cause of opposing drinking and preach joining AA. Someone in that situation might fall off the wagon every now and then. Is that hypocrisy? I think of it more as someone simply struggling with the issue they feel adamant about. \"Exposing\" him is like calling the guy who preaches against alcoholism due to the problems it has been to him as hypocritical because he fails and gives in and has a drink.\n \n Also, it's easy to just point a finger at someone and forget that this guy is human. It's the easy route to call him a \"turd of a human being\" rather than realizing he's going through some real struggles here. Do you not realize that he very well may be gay? Why would you not want to support him, as another fellow gay person, rather than attack him? Why is this not a case of shooting your wounded? If I understand the accounts of numerous gay people correctly, a lot of you who have \"come out\" have gone through a process of denying or opposing your own nature. Given that, why are you not any more understanding that this man may be going through the same struggles? I'm sorry, but it looks like you are taking a very calculating and vengeful stance here against someone who is probably struggling with some of the same feelings gays have had. This could be a great opportunity to show your view that coming out is ok and that gays can be compassionate, but you're wanting to see this guy suffer in some way. That's why I made the comment I did about the gay rights movement. How you all (even here on this forum) respond to this situation says a lot about your movement.\n \n And the fact he \"has the ear of W\" has nothing to do with whether this guy is or is not a hypocrite.\n \n * \"Vice\" is not being used here to make a moral statement about being gay, but rather to indicate how the subject in the article feels about the matter. In his thinking, it is a vice. This caveat to the analogy also applies to the alcohol analogy. It is not used here as a statement of worth or value in terms of gay people.",

There's a lot about blood.\"\n \n \"We [Christians] have lost every major city in North America,\" Haggard wrote in his 1995 book \"Primary Purpose,\" but said they can be reclaimed through \"violent, confrontive [sic] prayer.\" He encouraged believers to obtain maps of cities and to identify \"power points\" that \"strengthen the demonic activities\"--like gay bars. Indeed, staking out gay bars and trying to dragoon their patrons into coming to his services was one of the activities that helped Haggard build the New Life Church he founded.\n \n Haggard-who says he believes in \"spiritual war\"--organized his 14,000 congregants as \"warriors\" in a paramilitary, pyramid structure of 1,300 cell groups, whose members were commanded by section leaders, who reported to zone leaders, who were under the thumb of district leaders, who all answered to Haggard.

There are times in a Christian's life when they are outside of th will of God--it doesn't mean they aren't going to go to heaven. The point here is that you can't really use their statements on \"the Kingdom of God\" to prove that they think gays aren't going to heaven. Get it?",

As far as your second question, they \"do that\" because being in the will of God isn't the exact same concept as \"getting into heaven.\" They are able to do it because they are \"saved.\" They are Christian, even if they sin sometimes.\n \n Christianity is about being in a relationship with Christ.
