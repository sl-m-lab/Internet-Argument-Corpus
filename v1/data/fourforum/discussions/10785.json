   "As I sit here watching the returns from the New Hampshire primary, I find myself missing the NYTimes gay rights forum.

Of course you know you're still arguing against at least one (well, two if you count his notorious sockpuppet) of our old foes (who \"learned so much\" from us, but is still plainly in the employ of his Southern Baptist employers and hasn't changed his tune one iota in--how many years?), but his old song and dance has clearly faded in impact as society has changed over the years and we've made our advances. Your slam-dunk ripostes to his tired repetitions are always delightful confirmation of that fact. \n \n Yes, the camaraderie and \"Friday sillies\" are missed, but the good news is there are no more--and given the progress we've made will probably never be any more--\"Bob Maddoxes,\" thanks I'm sure in some small degree to your, and others', contributions to that and the CNN forum. These current trolls, like HonestAbe and IBelieveYou, seem more ludicrous than outrageous, scarcely worth the effort we used to expend in the old days. The dinosaurs are biting the dust, one by one, and though the community we shared then mayhaps must inevitably die with them, our gradually blossoming victory will last as a monument to those times... along with our memories.\n \n At least my memories of your cogent, calmly argued, articulate, passionate posts (and those about Ana, of course) will linger in my mind always. It has been an honor to be your compatriot on these forums. Thank you.",

   "I agree, VS. While these boards offer some solace, they don't replace the free-wheeling conversation that went on at the NYTimes boards. There, with so many interesting people posting on one thread, we could have several fascinating topics all at the click of one button. So, when we were ignoring the Archangels (or beet-boy, or whomever), we still had plenty of on-topic discussions going at once.\n \n Your posts, as always, are enlightening and offer true, personal insights. I preferred seeing them all in one place, rather than searching for them here.\n \n Alas, everything changes; and Gay Rights march on.",

   "Thanks to MrWrite and to Davenport for your kind words and thoughtful reflections on our old gay rights forum in the NYTimes. I think what made the NYTimes forums so interesting and lively was their ability to draw NYTimes readers from around the world. People of all backgrounds and beliefs read the NYTimes, including people who decry the newspaper as too liberal. But they still read it, and we had many different folks posting there. \n \n The moderators also allowed the conversations to range far and wide, which had its downside and its upside. The downside was that the gay rights forum and some other forums were sometimes hijacked by trolls who repeatedly posted filth and denigrated gay people or other people in the foulest imaginable language. The upside was that we heard a wide variety of viewpoints, and many interesting and sometimes odd people posted there, like Mapeche the beet guy. We developed a community of regular posters who posted for years, but the forum also attracted newcomers just about every day.",
