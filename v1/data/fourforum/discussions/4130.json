   "Socialism is where the government controls everything, and Capitolism is where the government controls nothing. Therefore all nations are mixture of both capitolism and socialism. \n \n A common misconception is that less taxes means more jobs. This is wrong, because the government creates jobs to. Every tax dollar goes towards creating jobs in one way or another. Some of it creates jobs directly (teachers, policeman, etc), and some of it goes back into the private economy via government contracts. \n \n If a country has to much socialism, then the country goes into a steady decline. However if the country has to much capitolism, then it inevitably goes into a depression. Therefore you cant have to much of eithier one. The US economy is bending a bit more towards capitolism then socialism, and as a result, our economy is instable. It traditionally has had high booms, and low recessions (outsourcing may mean the age of booms is over). A fairly socialist country like Canada however, has a very level economy.\n \n The reasons for this are:\n Socialism ensures that the economy will always have a core spending population. This assists the private economy by making sure that there will always be steady number of consumers, but it also saps the private economy at the same time because of its steep taxation. In Canada, this socialism has made sure that the economy is almost always ok (as opposed to good or bad).\n \n Capitolism however, allows most of the economy to go into private industry. Private industry is always a risky thing, so therefore it goes up and down. \n \n In a dollar to dollar ratio, Socialism is far more effective at creating jobs because: \n There is no outsourcing, and there isnt a bunch of executives (and stock holders) at the top soaking up vast amounts of the companys income for personal use. \n \n I would argue that a stable ok economy (that has little or no unemployment), is better then a floppy instable economy like ours.",

   "All being said, the only real differences in economic models between Canada and the US are\n \n 1 Public corporations, certain industries have a high share of government ownership in Canada. Generally in industries that will likely have a natural monolpoly, like electrical distribution, water and sewer services, and in some provinces electrical power generation. At times certain industries had a government owned company in the field, most notably Petro Canada, since sold and Air Canada, also sold and having since gone bankrupt. Petro Canada was used to insure that Canadian oil would have at least one major (for Canada) oil company. Air Canada, probably needed during the begining of the airline industry in Canada, but that god it was sold\n \n 2. Social services, most notably health care. Health care in Canada for the most part is strongly controlled by the government and provides generally equal care for all but the wealthy (who if needed will travel to the US for more expensive care in a private hospital). Overall I view social services (excluding health care) as have being somewhat excessive during the 80's and early 90's, causing a disincentive for people to work. This has changed while still providing for most of the people who really need it. We still have homelessness, and with the very fast rise in housing values during the last 8 years or so, it has increased quite a bit. Calgary having built two new and large homeless shelters ( Very nice looking buildings) that can house a few hundred homeless at a time still has people sleeping on the streets.\n \n The Canadian governments involvement in the economy has not helped Canada's economy remain stable, it has been the US governments involvement in the economy that has created the strong economic conditions in Canada. The loose economic policies along with the overvalued dollar in the US during the last 8 years has allowed Canada to form an overall trade surplus ( mainly with the US). \n \n Socialism, or social welfare when set a high level destroys the profit motive which generally causes people to inovate to reduce costs and create new products. This lack of inovation will lead to an overall stagnation in an economy, desptite any good intentions.\n \n The US however has become to short sighted for its own good. It government and many corporations are looking at short term profits instead of long term sustainablity of the economy or of the company. It would appear that the core economic activity in the US is now Short term enjoyment for long term pain.\n \n DA, your idea of a stable economy with limited ups and downs is the mantra of almost all governments including the US. Greenspan has been pumping money into the US economy in order to prevent an obivious recesion, the federal government is borrowing money at very high levels in order to keep America working. They have been doing this since the internet bubble burst and will by all accounts continue untill China and Japan say stop.\n \n As a side note, untill recently ( last 10 years) as America goes Canada goes. When the US economy was doing well, the Canadian economy was doing well. The bubble of the internet and tech industry changed that initially ( the effects of the bubble still has not hit the US the way that it will) Now China's growth is also changing the dynamics.",

It government and many corporations are looking at short term profits instead of long term sustainablity of the economy or of the company. It would appear that the core economic activity in the US is now Short term enjoyment for long term pain.\n \n\n \n I would have to argue that short-term results have, since the remarkable US prosperity following WW2, always driven US corporate performance. During my corporate tenure quarterly and annual results were all that really counted. Five-year plans were always in place, but the here and now commanded most assets. There have always been the giants who placed reserves and future planning on an equal plane with current business, but for the most part public companies worshiped equity market demands. \n \n The composition of most public companies places a high demand on ability to secure debt for capitalization and operating purposes. The majority of that debt, especially revolving lines of credit and bond issues, is based on equity position, determined by balance sheet stock (ownership) value driven by quarterly and annual earning statements. Maintaining that value is the primary responsibility of all corporate officers. During times of high prosperity, not a difficult job. During declining prosperity, as evidenced by massive corporate fraud primarily motivated by false earnings statements over the past few years, the men are separated from the boys and crooks. \n \n I offer no excuses for the cyclical management style of US public corporations, I'm just pointing out that there hasn't really been any real change in management style, just that the US lost world industrial dominance and is now paying the piper for extended, explosive growth without an eye to the future. I could expound on the influence of massive equity funds driving corporate earnings encouraged by government using dimwitted investor pre-tax money to drive a transaction oriented economy, but that's a different topic.",

This is generally expressed by the growth in the trade deficiet, and the change from America being a creditor nation to a debtor nation.

Unfortunately, the somewhat limited general public has been led to believe that tax cuts are good, not understanding that if they don't recapture lost tax revenue and contribute new wealth to a nation they're failures. That was a brief 'last harrah' of new wealth entering the US and we've since been concentrating on shedding our wealth through trade deficits and military spending, using unreasonable public debt to meet operating expenses. \n \n I hope our decline is as cushioned as that of Argentina. We seem determined to further alienate our creditors and the rest of the international community by our military aggression in forcing our ideology on smaller nations unable to defend themselves. The current US economic structure is so large and so heavily dominated by consumer and government spending that a gradual standard of living reduction in lower and middle classes might be very difficult to achieve.",
