   "What is your opinion on the safety of microwaves? I think that they are safe so long as their seal is intact and relatively new. However, my friend and I have been debating on and off for several months about it. He claims that it alters your food in some way, thus making it unsafe to eat. He claims it lowers your white blood cell count. I couldn't find any articles regarding it. I mentioned how there have been experiments testing the safety of microwaves, and he said that the ones receiving grant money from the government don't count because it's rigged so that they won't expose microwaves for the terrible things they are, since they are one of the major profit makers in our economy. So, your opinion on the safety? Reliability of experiments using grant money?",

There is concern regarding plastics in the microwave and whether or not they release harmful amounts of chemicals in your food. There is no question, they DO release chemicals into your food, but scientists are trying to figure out how much and if it is dangerous. Kindof makes you think, eh?\n \n I've seen a few reports on it. The only one I can refer you to though is somewhere at http://truthorfiction.com\n \n \n Oh well, keep us posted of your findings, if any.\n \n \n \n Lev",

   "Microwaves (the actual waves) being used to heat your food ar just plain NOT going to harm you (unless you put your head in the oven and cook it). Like epaphras_faith said, they just excite the water (and oils) and get it hot.\n \n Now, I have no idea whether they have some extra ability to liberate components of dishware into your food, but I would say that if the plate, plastic, or whatever you are cooking on doesn't get hot, then I can hardly imagine that it would release anything into your food.\n \n Again, cooking on a stove with teflon coated pans will probably do more damage, even though teflon is pretty chemically inert.\n \n I will say that I've heard bad things about cooking with aluminum, especially with acidic foods (which would leach aluminum into it). The same thing happens with iron pots and pans, but iron is good for you.",
