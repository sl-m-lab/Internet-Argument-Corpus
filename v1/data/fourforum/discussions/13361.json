   "It's my duty and pride tonight to be able to announce exactly what the Republicans plan to do for health care in America... It's a very simple plan. Here it is. The Republican health care plan for America: \"don't get sick.\" If you have insurance don't get sick, if you don't have insurance, don't get sick; if you're sick, don't get sick. Just don't get sick. ... If you do get sick America, the Republican health care plan is this: \"die quickly.\"\n\n Congressman Alan Grayson, Florida:\n Think Progress Grayson&#8217;s Right: Under The Republican Plan, &#8216;Don&#8217;t Get Sick&#8217; (Or You Might Have To &#8216;Die Quickly&#8217;)",
