   "Why not look at the root cause of terrorism as currently defined primarily by the US? Prior to the US invading Iraq, only the US was a target of Islamic extremists. That was, according to public statements by Al Qaeda, the primary Islamic extremist group, based on US presence in Saudi Arabia, US support of Israel's real estate policies and other self-serving US ME policy. So we have a non-strategic form of warfare where the objective by Islamic extremists is elimination of foreign ideological presence and influence, versus conventional strategic warfare where force is applied to change ideological positions and force removed if the ideological position is accepted. \n \n I don't believe any European country other than some of those those purchased by the US as part of 'coalition of the willing' have experienced any threatening or damaging terrorist activity. And with the exception of Iraq, most trade between European countries including Russia and ME countries has returned to former, pre-Iraq occupation levels. With Europe and Russia in particular helping arm those ME nations against what they now view as a greatly increased potential threat of US strategic war against them. NATO has refused to join the US in Afghanistan or Iraq (other than a small force in Afghanistan to defend humanitarian workers), further distancing European NATO members as potential targets from the non-strategic war.\n \n If a country is not engaged in conventional strategic war, nor threatening same, is pursuing normal trade relations within the ME without purpose of changing ideology, I would think any such country would view and investigate domestic 'terrorist' activity as defined by the US as a potential criminal matter, not as appeasement associated with strategic warfare.\n\n \n \n I know XXX-kissing posts are lame, but wow, that was extremely lucid!\n emoticon_wow",

It will then be too late to jump out. I see and listen to these radical Muslims in England and wonder to myself, how can the Brits be so blind? Tonight they were even attacking George Galloway of all people because he isn't radical enough. This is like the rise of the Nazis prior to WWII. No one took them seriously either except a few people like Churchill. The European mind of today is that of Neville Chamberlain and \"peace in our time.\" Or as Churchill said...\n \n \"Appeasers: Winston Churchill famously quipped, \"An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last.\"\n ==============================\n \n Prof. Lewis is widely regarded as the most erudite historian of the Middle East and Islam, a man who has spent most of his more than 80 years immersed in the primary sources of the region. Here, in an article that appeared in The New Yorker, he looks at the ways in which both recent regional history and elements of the Muslim worldview make the Middle East ripe for the appearance of terrorism in the name of a totalitarian version of Islam. The piece which follows is quite long, but very rewarding.\n \n ANNALS OF RELIGION\n \n THE REVOLT OF ISLAM\n When did the conflict with the West begin, and how could it end?\n \n BY BERNARD LEWIS\n \n The New Yorker, November 19, 2001\n \n I - MAKING HISTORY\n \n President Bush and other Western politicians have taken great pains to make it clear that the war in which we are engaged is a war against terrorism not a war against Arabs, or, more generally, against Muslims, who are urged to join us in this struggle against our common enemy. Osama bin Laden's message is the opposite. For bin Laden and those who follow him, this is a religious war, a war for Islam and against infidels, and therefore, inevitably, against the United States, the greatest power in the world of the infidels.\n \n In his pronouncements, bin Laden makes frequent references to history. One of the most dramatic was his mention, in the October 7th videotape, of the \"humiliation and disgrace\" that Islam has suffered for \"more than eighty years.\" Most American-and, no doubt, European-observers of the Middle Eastern scene began an anxious search for some thing that had happened amore than eighty years\" ago, and came up with various answers. We can be fairly sure that bin Laden's Muslim listeners - the people he was addressing - picked up the allusion immediately and appreciated its significance. In 1918, the Ottoman sultanate, the last of the great Muslim empires, was finally defeated-its capital, Constantinople, occupied, its sovereign held captive, and much of its territory partitioned between the victorious British and French Empires. The Turks eventually succeeded in liberating their homeland, but they did so not in the name of Islam but through a secular nationalist movement. One of their first acts, in November, 1922, was to abolish the sultanate. The Ottoman sovereign was not only a sultan, the ruler of a specific state; he was also widely recognized as the caliph, the head of all Sunni Islam, and the last in a line of such rulers that dated back to the death of the Prophet Muhammad, in 632 AD. After a brief experiment with a separate caliph, the Turks, in March 1924, abolished the caliphate, too. During its nearly thirteen centuries, the caliphate had gone through many vicissitudes, but it remained a potent symbol of Muslim unity, even identity, and its abolition, under the double assault of foreign imperialists and domestic modernists, was felt throughout the Muslim world...\n \n (Snip)\n \n Meanwhile, there is a more urgent problem. If bin Laden can persuade the world of Islam to accept his views and his leadership, then a long and bitter struggle lies ahead, and not only for America. Sooner or later, Al Qaeda and related groups will clash with the other neighbors of Islam - Russia, China, India - who may prove less squeamish than the Americans in using their power against Muslims and their sanctities. If bin Laden is correct in his calculations and succeeds in his war, then a dark future awaits the world, especially the part of it that embraces Islam.\n \n Dr. Bernard Lewis is Professor Emeritus of Near East Studies at Princeton University. He is the author of numerous books on Middle Eastern history including, most recently, \"Middle East Mosaic: Fragments of Life, Letters and History.\"\n \n http://www.aijac.org.au/updates/Dec-01/031201.html",

Outgoing interim prime minister and former US intelligence asset Iyad Allawi - known in Baghdad as \"Saddam without a mustache\" - badly wanted the Interior Ministry, so he could control his Ba'athist, Mukhabarat pals in charge of security and counterinsurgency. He didn't get it - the chosen minister is a moderate Shi'ite, Baqir Jabbur - nor any other cabinet posts he craved. So Allawi refashioned himself as opposition leader (his party had 40 seats in the elections), which would be tantamount to saying that the White House/Pentagon/Green Zone is now the opposition, since Allawi is the Americans' man. President George W Bush may have never thought he would be minority leader one day. \n \n A least six militias are rampaging throughout Iraq, armed, trained and funded by the Pentagon. One of these - the powerful Special Police Commandos, with at least 10,000 men - as already acknowledged by US generals - is widely involved in applying the dreaded \"Salvador option\" that retired General Wayne Downing, former head of all US special operations forces, considers a \"very valid tactic\". The Special Commandos were active in the assault on Samarra last October, which American generals hailed as a \"model\" of counterinsurgency operations (not exactly: the resistance continues). They are also active in Ramadi and Mosul. \n \n Their commander is the feared Major General Adnan Thavit al-Samarra'i, a member of an aborted, Allawi-conceived coup against Saddam in 1996. Thavit until now has been none other than the \"security adviser\" in charge of the face-lifted, Saddam-era General Security Directorate - infested with Saddam-era Mukhabarat agents. This is the organization Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld considers so precious that he had to fly to Baghdad to personally order Jaafari not to dismantle  it. Thavit also happens to be the uncle of the former minister of interior. All this explains Allawi's obsession in controlling a ministry that so graciously houses his Pentagon-cherished top militia. Two other militias - the Muthana Brigade and the Defenders of Khadamiya - are also subordinated to Allawi. \n \n From the White House/Pentagon point of view, the Special Police Commandos are the vanguard in the fight against the Sunni Arab resistance. But even with the commandos and with the Iraqi prison population swelling to more than 10,000, the resistance keeps averaging at least 60 attacks a day - and counting. Economic sabotage - the repeated bombing of electrical plants and oil pipelines - is relentless. \n \n The Marines also have their own pet militias, such as the Iraqi Freedom Guard and the Freedom Fighters: these are usually Shi'ites from the south sent to fight against Sunnis in explosive Anbar province - the heart of the resistance. Pentagon financing of these myriad militias and the active involvement of Allawi in all these operations suggest that the Pentagon itself is destabilizing the country it is supposed to control. Destination: civil war. \n \n It is not difficult to believe that Sunni Arab public opinion has not by any measure started to believe in the political process. It's true that many powerful Sunni Arabs, at least for the moment, are making a distinction between terror and resistance. But the moment the majority of Sunni Arab public opinion equates illegal occupation to the Shi'ites, Kurds and the political process, civil war is inevitable. There's nothing this hostage cabinet can do about it. We're not there yet, but it's getting closer by the minute. \n\n \n If the US government wanted a strong free democratic Iraq, it would be funding the Iraqi National army instead of funding private militias.

If Europeans had the slightest bit of common sense, they would stop this immigration of people who will not assimilate into their society dead in its tracks. You don't believe that? Ask the American Indians what happened to them. A stronger and more militant civilization came in, moved them out and eventually onto reservations. That's the real world out there. It may not be pretty, but it's real and not the fantasy that Europeans have been led to believe in. The reality is that native Europeans are an endangered species.\n\n \n I think you`ve been listening to mr Siegfridson to much. There is no danger on this scale. There are socio-economic costs of immigration, and they are more serious when a group doesn`t want to assimilate.

Muhammad ratified this judgment stating that it was a decree of God pronounced from above the Seven Heavens. Thus some 600 to 900 men from the Qurayza were lead on Muhammad's order to the Market of Medina. Trenches were dug and the men were beheaded, and their decapitated corpses buried in the trenches while Muhammad watched in attendance. Women and children were sold into slavery, a number of them being distributed as gifts among Muhammad's companions, and Muhammad chose one of the Qurayza women (Rayhana) for himself. The Qurayza's property and other possessions (including weapons) were also divided up as additional \"booty\" among the Muslims, to support further jihad campaigns.\" \n \n \n http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/001932.php",

The US hosts the best shool on the planet for learning to run an effective death squad. The key is to maximise terror in your public with minimal investment in manpower and equipment. You must also remember that torture is not just an art, or a hobby, it is a science. The key is to perpetuate the most amount of pain possible, but without crossing the threshold where their pain receptors stop firing. Example, if you burn somebodies feet witha blow torch, eventually their neaural system simply overloads, and they can not feel it anymore. It is much better to burn their feet with a blow torch for a short while, then pull a couple of teeth, always fromthe back, because when you get done torturing them, and after they publicly confess whatever it is you want them to, but before you kill them trying to escape, you are going to want to take some pictures so later you have them to show anybody who might suggest you tortured the confession out of them. After several days of continous torture and sleep deprivation, you can often get them to smile if you promise to kill them. \n \n I actually have textbooks on this stuff, printed with US taxdollars. Thisis the kind of \"aid\" we give to tyrannical governments. This is in large part why I am cynical when it comes to US foreign policy.
