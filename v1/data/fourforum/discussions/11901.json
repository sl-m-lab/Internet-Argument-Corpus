Hopefully it will be so at the polls and this horrid proposition will be struck down.\n \n Oh and thats me in the black T shirt with the sunglasses. It was such a positive and great rally. Really brought alot of great people together!",

What is painfully obvious is that whatever the age or the party of the voters, they don't want gay marriage to stand.\n\n I get really bored how you see the sun rising in the east, and automatically assume that others are wrong and you are right.\n Your claim is so flawed I don't know where to begin...\n \n 1) Everything I said is backed up by facts. A variety of polls all showing the same thing. \n \"66% voting for Obama\" doesn't mean squat on an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SUBJECT.\n \n 2) How many of those 66% do you think were ACTUALLY democrats?\n I don't know if you noticed, but there is a significant degree of Republicans who are interested in Obama being president.\n A vote for Obama doesn't mean it came from a Democrat. There are PLENTY of states that went \"blue\" for President, but when it came to \"Senate\" or \"House\", they were red...\n \n 3) My mind is boggling over the fact that I actually have to explain to you that \"18-30\" is NOT the only voting age range out there.\n In fact, historically the \"elderly\" voting turn-out is a rather STRONG voting force which cannot be ignored by the politician.\n \n 4) Okay. I'm going to have you think of more than one thing at a time here, so try not to let your head explode. If you feel light-headed, sit down and try to think again in a few hours.\n 66% of ages 18-30 voted for Obama.\n But Obama Got 52% of the OVERALL vote.\n Can you actually THINK of a way to explain that????\n \n And for extra credit, is it difficult for you to grasp that if it had been \"70%\" (66+4) of 18-30 voting for Obama, that would NOT mean that Obama gets \"56%\" (52+4) of the overall vote...\n \n \n \nThere you go again comparing the homosexuals desire to completely redefine our society in their image, in their selfish quest for special rights since you already have total equality with straight people, as you attempt to equate your agenda with the second class citizenship which African Americans suffered under.\n\n When the shoe fits, it gets worn.\n And I can't help but notice how absurdly propagandic you have made your description sound.\n \n \"redefine our society\"? NO. It's the GOVERNMENTAL POLICY we are talking about. If you and others in your roles in society decide that you don't want to recognize gay marriage IN YOUR PERSONAL LIVES, that's your perogative.\n \n \"in their image\"?? How stupid is that? Society WILL ALWAYS be \"defined\" as predominantly heterosexual. When blacks got equality, did that suddenly make all the white families \"interracial\"? Did it make the white families \"in the image\" of the black families?\n This whole junk is just a lame excuse to try to pretend that you are somehow being imposed upon just cause you can't discriminate against others...\n \n \"selfish quest for special rights\"? It's the heterosexuals who have exclusive \"special\" rights which are forbidden to gays. It is amazingly transparent how anti-gay people try to define EQUAL rights as somehow \"special\".\n And equal rights is not \"selfish\".\n What IS selfish is for me to pay the same taxes as everybody else, but have fewer rights and privileges than everybody else without a legitimate state reason for doing so.\n \n \"already have total equality with straight people\"?\n That has got to be one of the dumbest lies you have ever put out there.\n Can I adopt in all 50 states like straight people?\n Can I serve in the military like straight people?\n Can I marry my partner like a straight person can marry his/her partner?\n Your type of mentality would say that Jews can't adopt or serve in the military, but declare them \"equal\" just the same.\n \n \n \nYours is not a racial issue foundit, it's a social issue.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n The racial issues WERE \"social issues\".\n \n \n \nAnd the majority doesn't agree with your attempts to redefine marriage. PERIOD. But you don't care about that fact. You only care about what you want and screw the majority's will.\n\n When interracial marriage was declared constitutionally protected, there was a majority, by a margin of 3-to-1, which opposed it.\n The majority \"didn't agree\" with it then, and they continued to disagree until the late 80's/early 90's when there were finally more people who thought interracial marriage should be legal.\n \n That's TWENTY YEARS AFTER SCOTUS ruled it a constitutionally protected right.\n \n \n The real problem, which I know you won't be able to grasp, is that for people like you it's a situation of \"we don't like racism, but we embrace homophobia\".\n It's your personal choice, based on your personal distinctions.\n THAT is why you balk at the comparison, but you lack the capability to accurately recognize that is the ONLY REAL reason for doing so....",

I wont have my right to marry being torn asunder by a few narrow minded bigots and homophobes who cant look past their own judgmental ways to see what is clear. Times are changing.
