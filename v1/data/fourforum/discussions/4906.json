According to a recent Gallup poll, about a third of Americans believe that the Bible is literally true.....\n \n The deeply religious nature of the United States should not be allowed to stand in the way of the thirst for knowledge or the pursuit of science. Once it does, it won't be long before the American scientific community -- which already has trouble finding enough young Americans to fill its graduate schools -- ceases to lead the world. \n \n \n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31521-2005Jan23.html",
