Suicide rates among gays is about six times higher than heterosexuals, and the spread of sexual diseases is so common it causes danger physically and psycologically, and then what else is interesting is that 15% of the new problems today are caused by children of homosexual families, because they are having problems at home. Another issue is abuse. According to the \"Journal of Social Service Research\", a survey of 1200 lesbians, over half of lesbians have physical and verbal abuse by their partners. Why should children have to suffer from the parent's problems? They need a stable family. At any time, the gay father or \"mother\" can leave without notice because he is not married and therefore is not subject to care for the children.

   "Many animals are raised strictly by their mothers. Most non-mammals in fact. Some of course, aren't raised at all per se, and some have to watch out because mommy might eat them for lunch.\n\n \n Almost every species on earth do this. But this isn't what i'm talking about; I'm not talking about the single parent, I'm talking about Gay parents. When in nature do you see two adult animals of the same species and sex raising the younger of their kind? You don't. Why? Because it is unnatural. It is obviously a serious problem people have, and they must deal with it without performing their actions unfront of children! It has been proven by many Psycologists that homosexuality is really a psycological disfunction because of a sad or neglected childhood before the age of 10 (mostly before the age of five and after 2, when the child goes through his first two adolesences). Almost 40% of homosexuals are alcoholics, in fact, which is another disease, while the population of openly gay americans is at 2%! And what is the main factor of homosexual rights? Why do you think they want to be accepted? Because they want to have sex! They want the fact that they are attracted and sleep with their same sex to be accepted. Why should children have to deal with this factor? As you can see, homosexuals at many times are ill and thus is the reason why they are homosexual. It is not a safe enviroment for a child to live in with homosexual parents, as it brings psycological problems to the child, as I have proven. Why is this different from heterosexual families? Do heterosexuals ever really speak out loud about their right to have sex? Of course not! They don't, because they know that it is simply ludecrous to do so! Sex is a very powerful gift we have, and we can not simply show people that we can and do have sex, let alone with people of the same sex. \n \n It's actually interesting that you believe Gays should adopt children when single parents can't. Can I simply adopt a child right now? I study a lot, but I can give my child a lot of love. I'll work while the child goes to school. Let's say I'm 23, and so I'm ready to go. I get paid about $90 an hour, so I can give my child a lot of food and nessecities. But what is he missing? A mother! He needs a mother to give him the motherly love! My child would never live in a good home without a mother and father. All the major psycologists (Dr. Laura Schlessinger, Dr. Dean Edell, etc) agree that you need a mother and father figure. Will there be a mother and father figure in a gay household? I'm sorry, but no. No matter how hard one of the gay parents try, he cannot become a mother. Men have a different psycological and hormonal mentalities and physical appearences. Another question; what about a role model? What if two gay parents adopt a girl? Where will the role model for a mother be? There is none! What about if lesbians adopted a boy? Where's the male role model? There is none!\n \n \nHIV/AIDS is most certainly a problem. More so because current laws preventing gay marriage remove any incentive for gays to be in a healthy stable relationship. Another method that could serve to keep gay couples together is allowing them to adopt children. By removing any incentive or inclination for gays to stay together, you promote the unhealthy relationships you claim to abhor. And the 15% fact? A warrent for that if you please.\n\n The 15% was from a book, \"Journal of Social Service Research\". Why do you blame the law on \"healthy lifestyles\". If gays really want to get married, they can get married in a non-legal way (not illegal) but in mentality, and can simply live with each other. They can only have one sex partner, and therefore have a \"healthy\" lifestyle. Seriously, do you actually believe that prostitutes have healthy lifestyles? Should we legalize prostitution? Of course not. What about poligamy? No! There are some sexual things we cannot legalize. \n \nOK, fine. and 50% of all heterosexual marriages end in divorce. The stability thing is a systematic problem not confined to homosexuals.\n\n You may believe that 50% of people are divorced. Wrong. Of the 280 Million in the US, only 19 million are divorced, which means that less than 5% of non-child households and 5% of child-households are divorced... pretty small number. It really doesn't matter either; 50% of people who divorce remarry, and so they have a father and mother figure once more, and even if the parents are seperated, they still have a father and mother figure. It may be seperated, but it's there. I personally beleive that divorce should be illegalized, but that's just my opinion. I believe that seperation is fine, but divorce is just morally wrong. \n \nAs a wise man once said \"for every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong.\" You don't give any reason why it \"isn't suitable.\" Once again, an empty claim that is missing a warrent.\n\n This is a more exaggerated example, but do you think that a Nazi in a concentration camp should have a child with him 24/7? Of course not. There are simply some lifestyles not suitable for children! It's a clear thesis!\n \nI don't know, because I haven't experienced it. I do know this. First, the American Psychological Association disagrees entirely about these problems, saying its found no difference in the propensity for children of gays to have \"problems\" and those in \"normal families.\" Second, I know that in Florida, the 2 \"foster parents of the year\" who, happened to be gay, were denied the oppurtunity to adopt the children under their care, who have lived with them for their entire life, at least one who had aids, and don't know another family, simply because they were gay. That isn't in the best interest of anyone.\n \n\n The APA is extremely liberal and is extremely biased. Either way, only recently have gays adopted children (around the last 20 years), and thus there isn't really a chance for the child to grow into adulthood and show problems. I remember a girl in my class who had lesbian parents was made fun of, and I live in San Francisco! It's simply a matter of time before the child is made fun of for having gay parents. It's not a suitable lifestly.e\n \n \nEqual rights. \n\n If I was a single parent with a low income, should I adopt? No. Equal rights has absolutly nothing to do with this.\n \nAllowing gays to adopt doesnt = allowing all gays to adopt.\n\n I don't care if the couple has a good or bad lifestyle. All the lifestyles are unsuitable for children.\n \nPerhaps a mother and a father is better than two moms or dads, I disagree, but perhaps. But 2 dads or moms is better than an orphanage, or foster homes, and frankly their is such a shortage of adopting parents that we need to take any qualified couple we can get. Gays have no reason they should be disqualified out of hand.\n\n I believe foster homes are very wrong. As for orphanages, they have been illegalized for many years now. But frankly, children are happier in orphanages. My grandmother was in an orphanage and when she was adopted she actually wanted to go back to the orphanage! Her father figure was a priest and mother figure was a nun/s. Yes, my grandmother was raised by nuns. (By the way, I am Catholic, but I'm acting as an agnostic for the sake of debating in this forum. Don't ask why).",

   " When in nature do you see two adult animals of the same species and sex raising the younger of their kind? You don't. Why? Because it is unnatural.\n \n Unnatural. Is there a reason I should care what is \"natural\"? Its unnatural for \"unfit\" people to survive. Its unnatural for any sort of altruism to occur for fit people to protect other members of their species who aren't their children. The \"Naturality\" of an act is meaningless to me, because the state of nature is, as Hobbes would put it \"nasty, brutish, and short.\"\n \n has been proven by many Psycologists that homosexuality is really a psycological disfunction because of a sad or neglected childhood before the age of 10 (mostly before the age of five and after 2, when the child goes through his first two adolesences). \n \n Its been debunked by many more. Now despite your disdain for the APA I'll quote them again (I'll defend their credibilty in a moment) From: \"An American Psychological Association Statement on Homosexuality\"\n \"The research on homosexuality is very clear. Homosexuality is neither mental illness nor moral depravity. It is simply the way a minority of our population expresses human love and sexuality. Study after study documents the mental health of gay men and lesbians. Studies of judgment, stability, reliability, and social and vocational adaptiveness all show that gay men and lesbians function every bit as well as heterosexuals.\n \n Nor is homosexuality a matter of individual choice. Research suggests that the homosexual orientation is in place very early in the life cycle, possibly even before birth. It is found in about ten percent of the population, a figure which is surprisingly constant across cultures, irrespective of the different moral values and standards of a particular culture. Contrary to what some imply, the incidence of homosexuality in a population does not appear to change with new moral codes or social mores.\"\n \n \nAnd what is the main factor of homosexual rights? Why do you think they want to be accepted? Because they want to have sex! They want the fact that they are attracted and sleep with their same sex to be accepted.\n \n Why on earth would that be true? That would be like saying \"Constantine shouldn't have given christian's rights because all they want to do is convert people!\" Even if that was the primary facet of christianity, which it isn't, although it is a major part, that still isn't a reason to de facto deny them rights. Its a classic case of circular logic. Why do they want rights? To exercise their rights, which is bad! Uh...sure.\n \n \n As you can see, homosexuals at many times are ill and thus is the reason why they are homosexual. It is not a safe enviroment for a child to live in with homosexual parents, as it brings psycological problems to the child, as I have proven. \n \n Correction: as you have asserted without warrent, at direct odds with the largest and most respected psychology organization in America.\n \n \nWhy is this different from heterosexual families? Do heterosexuals ever really speak out loud about their right to have sex? Of course not!\n \n Ooh ooh! I know this one! Is it because they ALREADY HAVE THAT RIGHT? We have a winner, Johnny! As a general rule, people don't \"speak out\" about rights they already have. So I agree, it would be somewhat ludicrious for them to do so.\n \n \n \nSex is a very powerful gift we have, and we can not simply show people that we can and do have sex, let alone with people of the same sex. \n \n Umm...why? Its a part of life. Is their a reason we should hide it, other than that it makes you blush? Our powers of rational thought is a powerful gift too, should we hide and supress it too (think carefully here now, I know its tempting to try and supress rationality here too).\n \n \nIt's actually interesting that you believe Gays should adopt children when single parents can't.\n \n Actually, I believe that qualified single parents could too, and in many states they can. And I'm not going to even going to go into the statement that Dr. Laura is a \"major psychologist.\" Yeah, and so is Dr. Phil.\n \n \nAnother question; what about a role model?\n \n Umm...you can get role models from outside your family. I love my parents to death, but they aren't my role models, because we have different personalities. There are 2 billion people in the world. I'm sure they can find 2 role models of opposite sexes somewhere.\n \n \nThe 15% was from a book, \"Journal of Social Service Research\". \n \n Why is it ok for you to quote this source that I've never heard of, but the minute I quote the APA you shout \"LIBERAL!!!!\"? I doubt they are any less \"biased\" than the APA.\n \n \nIf gays really want to get married, they can get married in a non-legal way (not illegal) but in mentality, and can simply live with each other.\n \n First of all, marriage is a legal contract, so you can't get married in a non-legal way. You can cohabitate, but that doesn't have the degree of finality (nor the legal benefits) that marriage.\n \n Seriously, do you actually believe that prostitutes have healthy lifestyles? Should we legalize prostitution? Of course not. What about poligamy? No! There are some sexual things we cannot legalize. [\n \n No, because its illegal and thus we force them to be unhealthy by forcing them underground, yes, and yes. I for one do not believe in enforcing my values, sexual or otherwise, upon others. To do so is the height of arrogance and repugnant to a free society.\n \n \nIt really doesn't matter either; 50% of people who divorce remarry, and so they have a father and mother figure once more, and even if the parents are seperated, they still have a father and mother figure. It may be seperated, but it's there.\n \n Oh, so its ok to have a father figure who is either a) outside the home but biologically related, or b) inside the home and otherwise entirely unrelated, but its impossible to have a father figure who is outside and not biologically related? please.\n \nI personally beleive that divorce should be illegalized, but that's just my opinion. I believe that seperation is fine, but divorce is just morally wrong. \n \n If you have that much of a desire to enforce your own moral values upon a population (\"Its just morally wrong\") then nothing I can say can convince you. The middle ages are gone. People enter into sexual relations willingly, and can leave them willingly.\n \n \nThis is a more exaggerated example, but do you think that a Nazi in a concentration camp should have a child with him 24/7? Of course not. There are simply some lifestyles not suitable for children! It's a clear thesis!\n \n Being a Nazi isn't a \"lifestyle.\" For that matter neither is homosexuality. One is a person dedicated to killing people and burning them in cremotoriums. The other is...people who have sex with members of their own gender. The comparison is invalid, even if we accept that certain \"lifestyles\" (to be distinguished from political affiliations that advocate killing people) are wrong, their is no warrent to suggest that homosexuality is one of them.\n \n \nThe APA is extremely liberal and is extremely biased.\n \n Ok time to defend the APA. Why am I doubtful that they are THAT liberal or THAT biased. They are a, in fact the, national organization of psychologists. Not the national organization of liberal psychiatrists. Are their some liberals in their that will automatically assert that gays are perfect no matter what? sure. Are there conservatives that say the same thing, in reverse? absolutely. Do they cancel each other out. Yep, and thus its the unbiased moderates here who are really making the call. The attack on the APA as liberal is mere political oppurtunism who find the scientific consensus inconvienant. Forgive my skepticality.\n \n \n It's simply a matter of time before the child is made fun of for having gay parents. It's not a suitable lifestyle\n \n That logic is stunning. Something automatically becomes \"insuitable for children\" because people are biased and prejudiced against it? Better ban blacks too, they were victims of bias and prejudice for who knows how long (remember the desegregation arguments? \"they shouldn't be around our children!\") same with jews. We should be FIGHTING prejudice, not being indifferent to it and CERTAINLY not rewarding it.\n \nIf I was a single parent with a low income, should I adopt? No. Equal rights has absolutly nothing to do with this.\n \n Quite right, a single parent with low income shouldn't be allowed to adopt. That's because they don't show the proper qualifications and means to raise a child. That's a fair standard, but it needs to be applied ACROSS THE BOARD. If a homosexual couple can show that it has the qualifications, and the means, then it does become an equal rights issue when they are being denied even AFTER they meet the criteria being applied to everyone else.\n \nI don't care if the couple has a good or bad lifestyle. All the lifestyles are unsuitable for children.\n \n And this is where your argument implodes. \"I don't care if they satisfy every single requirement I can think up. They are gay, so it doesn't matter.\" No, if they do everything right, are monogomous, are committed, have the means, have the qualifications, have the strong family bonds then YES they should be able to adopt. If they don't meet these standards then they shouldn't. A perhaps some gays can't. But the ones that DO shouldn't be catogorically denied for what basically amounts to a prejudice that their mere existance disproves.\n \nI believe foster homes are very wrong. As for orphanages, they have been illegalized for many years now.\n \n Do you have another solution to what do with unwanted children, or do you subscribe to the \"let them die in the streets\" model?",

   "Hello,\n \n I'm in my late 30's and live in Scottsdale, Arizona. I'm a single man who will be adopting early in 2004 (still going thru classes. While I am homosexual I am not \"practicing\" for religious reasons (I'm Mormon) and am comfortable with that balance. We don't have a state law baring gay adoption here (although they look at it very closely). While a ruling in the mid 90's seemed to ban it the ruling specifically dealt with homosexual conduct. In my case being celebate (for the last eight years) seems to defeat that argument. I do not anticipate any problems with being awarded custody and have in fact been a good foster parent for the last two years.\n \n I hope to adopt the two boys placed with me now (age 6 & 8 brothers). They are very well adjusted here and we are very comfortable. I anticipate being successful.\n \n Part of the problem with the entire \"gay adoption\" discussion is the fragmentation of the two \"camps\". On one side you've got screaming liberals and the other side consists of religous fanatics (I know it sounds extreme but thats how you all appear). Both claim to take the needs of \"children\" to heart but I really don't see anything more then an \"its mine no its mine\" kind of playground argument going on here.\n \n The \"liberal left\" is right on a few points. Kids do fine in gay homes. Sure there may be some harrassement at school from kids whose parents are raising bigots. Thats fine and part of growning up. Hell, my father was a police chief, I was harrassed and beat up on a weekly basis, no one advocated taking me away from them or denying them the right to adopt me (yes, I was adopted too) because of \"harrassement\".\n \n Another good \"liberal left\" point is the fact that most of these kids go unadopted. We're not talking about infants here (theres a shortage). We're talking about older children who nobody wants. Look at this website a minute:\n \n www.lethimstay.com\n \n Tell me some nice married couple would take on five HIV babies? You just don't see that. People want infants, they don't want older kids, thats why you see older children languish in foster homes until they turn 18. Its a sad but true fact. \n \n Sure, kids from nice quiet married families (man & woman) turn out fine too. It may be better overall. Since there aren't enough of them to go around (and considering the 50% + divorce rate) what do we do. Totally abandon these kids because the adoptive parents don't \"fit the model\" or take in a pool of loving and caring people who want a family? You know, I could care less if a parent is gay as long as the kid is fed, does his homework at night and has a loving home. I don't care if hes an alien for that matter.\n \n You see, thats the real issue here, people disapproving of others \"lifestyles\" or \"orientations\" or whatever you want to call it. I personally have felt \"gay\" since I was 13. My parents sent me through counseling in H.S. although I never revealed it. I joined the Navy, had an honorable tour of service (and didn't tell anyone it was back in the Reagan days) and then got out and went to college. I started a successful company and now feed 12 families (my employees). Along the way I tried to \"become\" attracted to women, entered the Exodus program and also had homosexual relationships. \n \n Somewhere along the way I decided to not hate myself for being gay and just stay celebate. That way I can enjoy the benefits of my religion (like going to Temple - if your not Mormon you won't know what that means) and still accepting what I am. Its a delicate balance but one that has served me very well.\n \n I don't run around advertising I'm gay. My employees know I am (I have a small rainbow flag on the back window of my car) but they don't feel pressured by it in any way. I'm also a registered Republican and a member of the ACLU (I like Republican economics and hate their social programs). But maybe that \"identification\" is part of the problem too.\n \n I've noticed straight people (intolerant ones) sometimes run around screaming \"don't advertise\" and \"don't flaunt it\". Personally I don't, but I don't mind if I see two people in love kissing each other either. Likewise I don't mind seeing a happy gay family (like the couple on the lethimstay.com website above). Then again I also don't like seeing questions on an adoption application saying \"are you homosexual or bisexual\". Because if you are and you check \"YES\" they will deny you (like Florida). Then you'll have to sue and when it goes public you'll be accused of \"flaunting it\" again. If you don't ask many won't tell. \n \n Another issue is religion. Most of the arguments I see are religion based objections. Stuff like \"natural\" and \"nature\" and \"bibilical\" are all over message boards talking about gay adoption. To be honest I've been very happy with my position of homosexual and celebate. It is fine for ME. It may not be fine for the next person and it doesn't have to be. You see, I'm very religious, but I also know some people aren't. I'm not enough of a bigot to believe everyone should share MY view and no one elses. If you don't think abortion for instance is good then don't have one and if you support womens-rights then have all you want. All I see nowadays is people advocating laws based on morality. What is morality? Its religion and nothing more. I thought we had \"freedom of religion\" here in the US but sometimes it seems its \"laws of religion\" instead. I don't fault anyone for having strong religious convictions about issues. I do fault them completely when their religion is manifested into laws that affect ALL of us including those of us who don't share your religious views.\n \n I'll give you an example. I'm Mormon. The Mormons are famous for our super-low divorce rate, large well-adjusted families (kids don't commit as many crimes as non-mormon kids - fact), family home evenings and support network. Looks great huh? So maybe we need a law that says ALL families have to be Mormon? I don't think so. You see, we're also famous for our male-led family structure. Women will in the end obey their husband. Remember the controversy a few years ago when the Southern Baptists at their yearly conference proclaimed a woman would be subserviant to the husband? Civil rights groups jumped up and screamed foul. You know what, if the baptists want to do that fine, have fun. My point is they shouldn't expect ALL of us to do that. If you have a moral view that is based on religion keep in mind its a personal issue. You can speak it but its wrong to pursue laws based on religion expecting everyone else to follow suit. Considering religion has been responsible for more deaths by war (going back thru the Crusades in history) then any other cause you'd think we'd learn from our mistakes.\n \n Another reason I think \"straight\" people are afraid of gay adoption is they fear we will have success. Look at the hostility and bans on \"gay marriage\". It is claimed it \"cheapens\" marriage as a \"holy union\" (theres the religion thing again). Yet isn't it true that our divorce rate is over 50%? How cheap is that? I actually think they are afraid gays would have a much more successful marriage percentage wise then they would and THATS why they're so oppossed. Imagine if gays were able to marry and had a divorce rate of 10%? Marriage has only been \"cheapend\" by the \"divorce store\" mentality (we have a \"divorce store\" chain here in Phoenix). Maybe like marriage adoption is so contested because they fear we may actually have success. I know I'll be successful.\n \n In the end all these \"studies\" are worthless on both sides. Anyone can post a \"study\" advocating a position. Don't believe me? Theres websites advocating child molestation (boylove) with \"studies\" about how beneficial a relationship with a man can be for a child (I read about them in USA Today). You tell me for one minute you'd believe that \"study\". \n \n In the end it's all up to the parents. What kind of loving home will the child have. These older kids have no one to take them in and care for them. If you believe they are better in two parent (male & female) homes then why aren't you all lining up to take them in? Why are there twice as many kids in foster care today as there were ten years ago? These kids deserve a good home with loving caring attention and support. I don't care if someone is black, white, gay, straight, alien, human, tall, short, skinny or fat. If they can provide the support the child needs they get my vote of support.\n \n azwebdesigner@yahoo.com",

People are free to live their lives they way they want to, but they should not try to force their own beliefs down other peoples' throats.

It was interesting. I was surprised that Steve and Rodger have been together 20 years. You always hear that gay men are not monogamous at all and have numerous partners.

   "The problem with any \"study\" is they are always conducted from a certain point of view. Of course you'll have homosexual and liberal groups saying \"they're fine\" and conservative groups saying \"they're not\".\n \n I challange ANYONE to point to a study otherwise?\n \n I tend to trust sources like the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association and similar groups for their opinions. They are large organizations made up of professionals in the field. I don't trust study material from gay advocacy groups anymore then I do from conservative christian groups.\n \n If someone \"hates fags\" of course they'll find study material saying the kids are damaged. If someone is gay of course they'll find material saying kids are ok.\n \n It all really depends on the parents. Sexual orientation really doesn't play a part in the equation. Sure some kids may be picked on at school because of their parent but who cares? I was constantly harrassed throughout school for being fat and the son of the police chief in our city. Kids are cruel by nature.\n \n Good and bad kids come from ALL kinds of families. If you like Broker I'll be happy to list the last 10 major school shootings here and I'll also point out that those kids were ALL from traditional \"mommy and daddy\" type families.\n \n The point is it doesn't matter. It's the individual parent who does matter. If a couple of kids from gay parents turn out bad its no more fair to say \"see they're screwed up\" then it is to point out a few bad apples from hetrosexual families and say \"see hetros raise bad kids\". Grouping is something I thought we were over in the US. For some recent history look back to the days of racism and segregation when ALL blacks were lazy. Look back to the days when ALL jews were considered greedy and stingy. Look back to the days when ALL asians were considered sneaky. \n \n They say those who don't learn from mistakes are doomed to repeat them?\n \n The APA study is verifiable and well run with a good sampling of families. They didn't just interview the GOOD families they talked to them all. Its really a shame that some people are so biased toward people who aren't \"like them\" they'd sacrifice kids in the process. I'm sure if you look there were some BAD families and kids in that study. But an overall picture was positive. It didn't say 100% are great. It said generally they turn out as well adjusted as kids from other family types.\n \n If someone is willing to provide a good home, guidance, love and support as well as instill confidence in a child they should be allowed to adopt. I don't care what their race, sexual orientation, marital status or anything else is. Soceity needs good and caring parents. \n \n If your interested look in the \"schools failing\" fourm on this board. I posted there (I'm running for school board next year here) my opinion of the PARENTS responsibility for failing schools.

   "Since we have some people who are opposed to gay adoption (mostly for religious reasons it seems) I have a challenge for you.\n \n Jesus asked His disciples to give up all their worldly goods and follow Him - which they did. \n \n I would ask you to do the same.

You'd think with all the moral outrage at gay adoption (and the conservatives claim we make up 1% of the population not 10%) they would be NO kids left for adoption. I would assume all this outrage and TALK would translate into WALK - that is adopting a \"less desirable\" older child, someone with ADHD or illness. But it doesn't does it?\n \n I read about invertro-fertilization techniques and people spending $50,000 to have a baby. People waiting years to adopt infants. If they're so \"concerend\" about these older kids they don't want them to be adopted by the \"fags\" then why aren't they adopting them?\n \n I myself was adopted (age 2) and consider my parents to be my parents. My mother & father couldn't have kids so they adopted me and my brother. Prior to that they were foster parents for two sickly children who died. They were REAL CHRISTIANS who gave of themselves and opened their homes to take in the unwanted and abandoned sick child.\n \n When I see people stomp around in moral indignation I really wonder. It is just a vocal minority were dealing with here. It's kind of like the abortion debate. Polls continually show support for womens rights yet they stomp and yell. Well, if we ban abortion how many crack babies will you adopt?\n \n It's easy to take a position, stand on a pedastal and preach to the world.

It is the law of the land. However, that still does not make killing ethical. If a toddler at age 18 months still lacks the ability to speak for himself, is it still the right of the woman to murder that child. Let's get this straight, abortion ends life. Whatever value you place on that life is up to you. The law says the choice is in your hands. Just as I would have ethical problems killing another man in cold blood, I would have moral restraints keeping me from ending a life inside the womb. The choice for me is obvious. I don't wish to impose my moral beliefs on anyone else, for it would be illegal for me to do so. However, I do find it sickening that there are so many out their that have no inhibitions regarding killing something out of inconvience.

   "don't get me wrong, I'm pro-gay adoption, but I think you guys are making gay couples out to be saints of some sort. I'm sure that not all gay couples would prefer to adopt HIV babies over the more desireable healthy infant.

Once a baby is born, the woman will most likely develop an emotional attatchment not present when simply addressing a little pocket of gulosh in her uterus. If the baby is kept by that woman and that woman is incapable of adequately providing for it, it will suffer.

   "Now... I was raised by a single mother. My main role model has always been my mother. Honestly, as someone who tries not to take sides, but rather just says what I believe, I can't say if that had any effect on my turning out gay or not. I wouldn't take up arms if it were found to have an influence. I don't really care about that -- it doesn't matter to me whether my \"dysfunctional\" family situation had an effect. Of course, it wasn't dysfunctional, I know what dysfunctional is like, as I've spent a year subjected to it, and it was the worst year of my life. My mother was a wonderful parent. She didn't always have time to be with me, and for many of my early years she was a full-time straight A college student. But, when she did have time for me, she was a class of parent that is far better than what I've seen in many of my friends.\n \n There are a couple of older points I didn't feel were properly addressed, or that I felt a desire to address from my own point of view beyond just how they were addressed by others, so I'm going to start from the beginning and pick a few points to talk about. I'd ask to be humored on this. :)\n \n \nThe reason behind it is because they don't feel secure. Imagine having two mothers; you don't have a father to guard the house, so the child feels like there's no protection. At the same time, if you have two fathers, you have two people to yell at you all the time, and two people to make you more masculine (although masculinity in gays is pretty rare :D ), and thus you don't get the calmness of the mother. \n\n \n In my humble experience, a good half of the lesbians I know are more than capable of guarding the house. They'd probably bitch you to death if you walked onto the porch the wrong way. They'd just raise GI Jane or something. I don't say this to be disrespectful to them, they're really quite likeable, but they're also badass to an extent that I don't see much in straight women. Like I said, that isn't universally applicable.\n \n As far as having to men to parent, chances aren't really overwhelming that they'll be a masculine/feminine pair in such a way that one could take a more motherly role, just from my experience. Out of those I know, even those who are quite feminine are really quite masuline in other ways, and I don't know many gay men who could be a \"mother\" to a child, even if they could be a \"wife\" to another man. On the other had, one thing I can assure is that quite ofen you will not have two men to \"yell at\" the child, and you will find the \"calmness\" of the mother, just in a different way.\n \n \nFirstly, what is the main purpose of homosexual's lives? What are they fighting for most? What is the largest thing that surrounds them? Sex.\n\n \n That's a rather rude and crude assertion. I know at least a half-dozen gay men that I could probably have sex with if I really wanted, and I've never approached any of them. How would you like it if I said your life revolved around sex? I've known a couple of people who \"sleep around\", but that's their problem, not mine.\n \n Speaking from experience, the culture of having a group of friends who are all mutually attracted naturally lends itself to them having sex more than others -- in this sense, the \"gay culture\" is indeed more \"sex centered\" than most people are used to. It isn't an inherent issue with homosexuals, but with homosexuality in general and the way people socially interact. If you take a straight man who talks about sexuality and women to his straight friends, but then make them all gay and have them talk about men, the natural topic of sexuality is thrown a curve. I would theorise from what little I've seen, that in general, if women and men are as willing to talk about it in a group as men and men are, the \"straight\" group tends to be more sexually active than the average clump of straight men and women, because it breaks down barriers and makes it easier to act of the \"she's hot\" instinct. Add that to the way gay men on average tend to be more attractive than straight men (don't yell, most women I've spoken to agree with me -- gay men are better at grooming themselves), and it would be amazing if statistics DIDN'T say that gays have sex more often. They say that because we do.\n \n The most important point to draw out of that, however, is that while I personally will not argue that we don't have sex as much, I will argue that it has nothing to do with the people themselves being sex-centered. It has to do with the social dynamic and the way members of the same sex interact in general. I can attest that while statistics may seem to indicate otherwise, neither my life nor that of anyone I know revolves around sex. It's not more important, it's just more accessable.\n \n Now, while I may seem to be giving the argument away, I will stress that statistics such as those claming that gay men have a new partner every week or something like that are utter BS. It doesn't matter how \"easy\" the culture may be, unless you're in a stable relationship or you're just really, really dirty, you're never going to keep up with Mr. Bond. Maybe in some really dirty corner of New York where people have no morals and have sex with total strangers, but that's just disgusting to everyone, and that's not about homosexuality in general anymore, and nor does it have to do with the \"culture\". Anyone like that should not be allowed to adopt.\n \n \nWhen in nature do you see two adult animals of the same species and sex raising the younger of their kind? You don't. Why? Because it is unnatural.\n\n \n Homosexuality occurs in nature, as do pairings of two adult animals of the same sex. Recreational sex does not occur in nature, with the sole exception of in dolphins. Adoption does not occur in nature at all. If there's an exception, I don't know it. What I don't understand is how, when the prenessisary act of adoption does not occur in nature, it is logically valid to use that argument that gay couples don't raise children in nature. Because they can't breed and there is no other way to have children, they don't. Not because they're incapable of raising the children, but because the children don't get to them. To use this argument is to declare that children being raised by non-biological parents is unnatural and wrong, and thus adoption itself should be stopped. Incidentally, to use this argument is to validate homosexuality itself, in case that was in question.",

   "Why do you think they want to be accepted? Because they want to have sex!\n\n \n Yes, that is one thing. Also because we'd like to be able to get married, or because we'd like to adopt, or because we'd like to make sure people are more intelligent about the issue than you are. Sorry for the low blow, but frankly that's one of the main reasons for gay activism. Frankly, we're doing a good job of it too. Those under 30 are something like 50 to 70% more likely to be pro-gay marriage than those older. This is a rough statistic I made up on the spot based on the demographics of a recent poll conducted after the US Supreme Court knocked down the Texas Sodomy law.\n \n \nI remember a girl in my class who had lesbian parents was made fun of, and I live in San Francisco!\n\n \n I remember a boy in my class who was new to the school, and decided to make a rather unpleasant remark about gays. The reaction from the other students is about what you'd expect if you'd said the same about blacks. I don't live in San Francisco.\n \n \nWait, Everybody on this forum, think real hard about the question Im about to ask you and dont lie. Would you want to be raisee by gay women?\n\n \n Not particularly, no, and I don't have to think hard about that. Would I cry social injustice if I did? God, no -- the lesbians I know are surely quite capable of raising children, be they super feminine or super bitchy.\n \n \nIndocrinating youth to advance your agenda is wrong. Raising kids because you care about them and want them to maximize their potential is another thing. I find that social services would have a hard time making this distinction when evaluating a gay couple. The welfare of the child is the most important objective with respect to adoption, not politically correctness. There is reason to suspect that you may be placing the child into a sexually abusive situation, by allowing sexual deviants to adopt the child. Therefore, I must object to gay adoptions.\n\n \n I agree on the morals of why you should raise kids. I also am open to the idea that social services wouldn't have the best judgement -- but that's a problem that should be addressed itself, and not by blacking out all possible applicants. You said above that there are enough normal families, but I disagree. I believe that there is a shortage.\n \n Your last point regarding sexual abuse and sexual deviants, I don't believe that stands. In my eyes, that requires an outside view that all sexual \"deviations\" are similar, or that anyone who is \"immoral\" enough to deviate to one is more likely to devate to another. While I'll tentatively agree that it's likely anyone who is faith-bound not to participate is sexually deviant activities and sticks to it is probably unlikely to do any of them, I'll not agree that because someone does something sexually deviant that makes them at risk for pedophilia.\n \n \"Sexually deviant\" is very vague. If sexually deviant means gay, then the idea that it is somehow connected to pedophillia is only valid if homosexuality is considered a disease or a fetish of some sort, and I know that you will get nowhere trying to push that belief. If sexually deviant means a number of other, unrelated practices, then I can still argue from first hand experience that they have no relation to homosexuality or pedophillia, because I have the distinguished privledge of being homosexual and \"sexually deviant\" in a variety of ways, and still having no interest whatsoever in pedophillia.\n \n \nI would be all for gay adoption if most of society accepted it. I don't really have much fact to come to a conclusion about it, I don't know anyone who was adopted by homosexuals. Does anyone else?\n\n \n I do, and they don't get any flack from their schoolmates either. Then again, the school I went to was terribly \"liberal\" and openminded. A shame more schools aren't like that, minus the super-liberal cirriculum.\n \n \nI don't think there would possibly be that many gay couples who are against gay adoption. I would be surpised if there were any. What kind of \"gay\" is going to be for restricting their own rights?\n\n \n Anytime anything is universally banned, you're restricting your own rights, but people do that all the time. As for myself, I am for gay adoption. I do think that I myself would make a better parent than a lot of people I know. As would my boyfriend.\n \n \nDid you ever think that if gay adoption became legal then maybe the bullying would stop in school as people got used to it? Besides, people survive bullying in School - If anything, I think it makes you stronger.\n\n \n I didn't. In fact, I don't. But I think that by pushing the \"gay agenda\", the next generation of more socially-concious parents will raise children who will be more sensitive to such things. Nah, they'll still be nasty kids, but it's worse now than it will be. And we already have schools like mine, where being gay and out is a better move than being homophobic and \"out\" about your beliefs.\n \n By the way, my condolences on the death of your partner. That is very sad. You're right about sex being easy to find, and love not. There are a lot of attractive gay men. Not all of them are worth falling in love with. :)",

   "Man, I hope I don't repeat what Jonathan just said, but I wanted to respond to a few things I read on this thread, some of them from several months ago.\n \n Look: If you don't want to watch me pick apart earlier arguments, then skip over this part. But read the end, because that was my real reason for posting. Just scroll down until you see a bunch of astericks, like this:\n \n *************************\n \n First off, no, the point of homosexuality is not sex. As has been pointed out, that's like saying a heterosexual relationship is about sex. In other words, a guy gets married for the purpose of having sex with a woman. No. A guy would get married because, hopefully, he's found a girl he loves and wants to spend the rest of his life with. Same thing for gay relationships, just replace \"a girl\" with \"another guy\".\n \n Also, I'm pretty sure it was Parcum who pointed out the \"health\" problems associated with homosexuality.. since we're so much more inclined to have AIDS or commit suicide. Does that mean straight couples who are terminally ill or suicidal get to adopt? Of course not. You take everything by a case-by-case basis. Statistically, blacks are also more prone to AIDS and suicide. Apparently, there are \"health risks\" associated with them.\n \n Several people think adoption should be illegal because the kid would be made fun of. This is blatantly circular logic. Kids would make fun of it because society hasn't fully accepted homosexuality yet. So your solution to that is... keep gay adoption illegal and further postpone social acceptance? Are you assuming one day everyone's going to magically wake up and collectively tolerate homosexuality? Social change comes about slowly, exactly because of laws against discrimination, etc.\n \n And aside from that, since when is the danger of a kid being made fun of enough to raise questions of rightful custody? Everyone's made fun of at some point. You can't stop it, you can only curb it.. and not surprisingly, the only way to do that is to eliminate laws that make gay people second-class citizens.\n \n As for Dr. Laura. She has yet to develop a reputation as an impartial observer. We'll make a deal.. You don't quote Dr. Laura, and I won't quote Bishop Spong.\n \n Parcum also said at one point that scientists have proven homosexuality is a psychological disorder based on neglect or abuse early in one's childhood. There are a few things wrong with this.\n \n Firstly, it is an entirely false statement. No one has proven anything. That's why there's so much debate on choice, because neither side has any solid proof.\n \n There is, however, a truckload of evidence leaning toward biological origins. Some study done on twins separated at birth which found that sexual orientation was significantly consistent with them. That's a hell of a coincidence, if we're talking about neglect.\n \n Finally, speaking from own experience, there was absolutely no neglect from either of my parents in my childhood. They were fantastic parents. And besides, my brother (with an identical childhood and only 1.5 years older) turned out straight. I didn't.\n \n Parcum also claimed a 5% divorce rate in the US, because there are 280 million people and only 19 million are divorced.\n \n Holy XXXX. Did anyone notice that the 280 million includes EVERYONE in the US, including infants, adolescents, single people, and homosexuals? And that the 19 million was the number of people CURRENTLY divorced (that is, not remarried)? The 50% divorce rate (a statistic that is simple fact) is a much more straightforward brand of mathematics than what Parcum invented: it's the fraction of people who have ever divorced over the total number who have ever married. That's what a divorce rate is: the rate that divorce occurs.\n \n And our final quote of the evening, also by Parcum:\n \n \"Either way, only recently have gays adopted children (around the last 20 years), and thus there isn't really a chance for the child to grow into adulthood and show problems.\"\n \n The interesting thing is that this doesn't stop you from \"proving without a doubt\" that gay parents are bad for kids. You can't discredit someone's statement by saying there isn't yet enough data to study, and then turn around and try to prove the opposite side. There's still not enough data, according to you.\n \n Anyway.\n \n **************************\n \n Okay, stop scrolling. This is what you came here to read:\n \n We can argue about all this XXXX all we want, but the truth is most of it is based on very limited data and our own moral intuition. What we lack is a detailed understanding of child psychology and mental health, the sort of study that comes with a PhD or medical license. This is the difference between ourselves and those who work in adoption agencies. Ideally, they're much more knowledgable and better prepared to make decisions about who should adopt who.\n \n The problem is that legislators lack this same education. Most are lawyers or businessmen. They're absolutely not the best suited to make these decisions.\n \n A law banning homosexual adoption is ridiculous, because it's an imposition of policy by a group that knows very little of the subject at hand upon a group that has spent lifetimes acquring that knowledge. That said, a law forbidding adoption agencies from discriminating against homosexuals would be equally ridiculous for the same reason.\n \n It only makes sense to let the adoption agencies use their hopefully vast understanding of children to decide who is suitable to adopt. That's their job. There's a reason politicians don't pass laws spelling out a certain \"correct\" procedure for brain surgery. They don't know XXXX about it. You leave that stuff to the actual neurosurgeons.",

You get 2 mothers and 2 fathers there... of course in the gay couple you would have either no mother or father... but there are also lots of children who are raised by the mother without the father present and vice versa....

   "Oh man where to begin. Hopefully I'll be able to bring a slightly different perspective to this debate. \n \n I grew up in the foster care system, and lived with 4 different families (all of them were straight couples and all but one were highly disfunctional) untill I finally just left at 16. I will tell you that children really do not care who their parents are or what kind of sex they may or may not be having. Trust me it's the furthest thing from their minds. Kids need a happy loving home and if a gay couple can provide that then they should be able to adopt. \n \n The fact is their are many more children who need adoptions than their are good homes for these kids. And we have the nerve to automatically preclude thousands of gay couples who can provide good solid homes. \n By leaving out this large group of people from adopting kids we lower the standard of those who are eligable. The main people who are hurt from gays not being able to adopt children are the kids who get put with foster parents who have absolutely no business trying to raise kids.\n \n As for the concern of kids being bullied in school by other kids. Sure it may happen, but from my experience in todays schools anyone who is openly hostile to gays is much more likely to be shunned by his fellow classmates. It is a very different world for my generation. About the only thing we don't tolerate are people who are biased against others. So for my older debaters who don't share that point of view, stand by the world is changing very quickly. I'd hate to see the rug pulled right out from under you",

Personally, I think this is a rather rediculous, and pointless, argument. I know many gay couples who have had longterm relationships and it is not only about sex. So let's just throw that argument out now.\n \n On the other hand, when did sex in a relationship become a bad thing. Would you rather live with two people who have sex regularly and live a happy life, or with two people who don't have sex and have constant tension in their relationship because of it. Sex is a normal healthy part of any adult relationship. The only time it may cause problems is if the child has the misfortune of hearing his or her parents having sex. I really don't think it would matter if the parents are gay or straight, it's going to be disturbing for the kid one way or another.",

   "check out these sites for information and studies about problem with homosexuals adopting. \n\n \n Did you just post those links as an argument in and of themselves, hoping no one would actually check them out?\n \n The first site was a 404 error (site not found), which is actually part of the URL had you even looked at it, and the second site was a link to this article-\n \n \nGay Parenting Does Affect Children Differently, Study Finds\n -- Authors Believe Gay Parents Have \"Some Advantages\"\n \n (...)The new study by two University of Southern California sociologists says children with lesbian or gay parents show more empathy for social diversity, are less confined by gender stereotypes, and are probably more likely to explore homosexual activity themselves. Writing in recent issue of the American Sociological Review, the authors say that the emotional health of the two sets of children is essentially the same. (...)\n \n \"These studies find no significant differences between children of lesbian and heterosexual mothers in anxiety, depression, self-esteem and numerous other measures of social and psychological adjustment,\" said the authors. (...)\n(emphasis mine)\n \n The only \"negative\" consequence the NARTH could come up with was increased openness to homosexuality (big surprise!). Any increase in homosexuality would just as likely be due to an increased probablility of \"coming out\" or even just experimentation rather than an actual increase in homosexuality.\n \n \nWhen in nature do you see two adult animals of the same species and sex raising the younger of their kind? You don't. Why? Because it is unnatural.\n\n \n Actually, you don't often see two adult animals of any sexes raising children alone in mammals or even primates, so your point is moot in any case. Most mammals and primates live in groups, not couples. The primates that do pair are lemurs and gibbons (nocturnal basal primates). The primates most genetically similar to humans are bonobos and chimpanzees, who live in same-sex or mixed-sex groups (bonobos also engage in homosexual behavior BTW, and chimps are known for very strong male-male bonds). Chimps are also more violent and agressive with each other/others, whereas bonobos are generally peaceful and docile. What does this mean? IMO it means that there are many choices of how we can organize ourselves, sexually and socially.\n \n \nPhylogenic models revealed that pair-living has evolved independently in all major primate radiations, but it is nevertheless the rarest type of social organization (Kappeler, 1999c; Kappeler and Heymann, 1996; van Schaik and Dunbar, 1990). The rarity of pair-living among primates (and other mammals) is not surprising, given our current understanding of sexual differences in potential reproductive rates and the resulting conflict of interest between the sexes. Males should seek to maximize their reproductive success by mating with as many females as possible, and the defining characters of mammalian reproduction provide them with the opportunity to do so.\n \nInternational Journal of Primatology, Vol. 23, No. 4, August 2002 ( C\u00b0 2002)\n Evolution of Primate Social Systems \n Peter M. Kappeler and Carel P. van Schaik\n \n more about bonobos \n \n \nIn mammals many different behaviors have been observed that might be associated with male homosexuality. Among primates homosexual behaviors are particularly diverse. These include such practices as the mounting of one male by another (e.g. Langurs, pig-tailed macaques, baboons, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos) (Sommer 1990; Oi 1991; Lorenz 1963; Yamagiwa 1992; Hayaki et al. 1989), including mounting with anal penetration (e.g. stumptailed macaques, squirrel monkeys) (Sommer 1990; Maple 1977), and mounting with anal penetration and ejaculation (Japanese macaques, rhesus macaques, gorillas) (Sommer 1990; Gadpaille 1980; Edwards and Todd 1991). Masturbation of other males has also been reported, including mutual masturbation (e.g. stump-tailed macaques) (Sommer 1990) as well as genital-genital contacts (e.g. bonobos) (Enomoto 1990), at times leading to ejaculation (e.g. gibbons) (Edwards and Todd 1991). Fellatio has also been reported for stumptailed macaques (Sommer 1990). Other perhaps related behaviors include sniffing/inspecting the genitals/anal region of other males (e.g. stumptailed macaques,) (Sommer 1990), \"displaying\" an erect penis to other males (e.g.vervet macaques)(Henzi 1985), and urinating a few drops on the other male during the display (e.g. squirrel monkey)(Castell 1969). In some cases males have shown a preference for their homosexual partners over heterosexual partners (e.g. rhesus macaques)(Sommer 1990). \n\n \n \n As to the \"it's not 'natural' so it's bad\" argument-\n \n First, when people don't like something, they like to say it's bad because it's \"not natural\". Of course, they are never able to really define what this \"natural\" human state really is, and rarely really believe that just because animals or pre-historic humans didn't/don't do something it must be bad. Therefore that argument holds no validity.\n \n Second, animal groups use sexuality and coupling in very varied ways, for very varied reasons. Certainly a very common mammal and even primate behaviour is to live in homosexual (meaning here same-sex) groups for most of the year, for example with the females occupying the interior foraging for food/caring for young and the males occupying the exterior protecting the group. They only ever interact socially heterosexually during mating season, after which they go back to their same-sex group to raise the children. I hardly think this is the vision of \"natural family\" life that NARTH would put forward. It is, however, the most common mammalian behaviour not to couple heterosexually except exclusively for procreative purposes. Infanticide is also common in mammals- is this \"natural\" and therefore good behaviour?\n \n \nHomosexuality occurs in nature, as do pairings of two adult animals of the same sex. Recreational sex does not occur in nature, with the sole exception of in dolphins. Adoption does not occur in nature at all.\n\n \n I have to disagree with you. Many species have sex for reasons other then procreation (which is assumed when they have any kind of sex which can't lead to reproduction), for example bonobos who seem to engage in same-sex sexual behaviours as a form of social currency, and baboons who seem to be willing to engage in virtually any kind of sexual activity with virtually anyone. Neither of which I think is really relevant to human sexuality for a few reasons I explain above. Animals do not generally conform to our definitions of heterosexuality (or homosexuality) at all.\n \n BTW, elephants \"adopt\", even outside their species, and actually even \"midwife\" each other's births.\n \n Fundamentally, this comes down to debating whether there is some kind of \"divine plan\" of heterosexual normativity to human/animal social/sexual organization in general, which is not supported by research.",

   "I don't think gays should adopt children. Children, for some reason, come out with psycological problems after they had gay parents. The reason behind it is because they don't feel secure. Imagine having two mothers; you don't have a father to guard the house, so the child feels like there's no protection. At the same time, if you have two fathers, you have two people to yell at you all the time, and two people to make you more masculine (although masculinity in gays is pretty rare :D ), and thus you don't get the calmness of the mother. Foster homes may be bad, but we can change them. They can probably inspect homes and make sure the child will get the best treatment available.\n\n A Tale of Two Zachs\n From: The Advocate\n \n \n \n It always comes down to the children. The forces opposed to fair treatment of gay and lesbian families love to claim that gay people want to rub the noses of innocent babes in the ickiness of gay sex.\n \n It's a lie, of course. The truth is, it's straight parents, not us gay folks, who can't get their minds out of our bedrooms. We know you don't have to talk about sex to tell your child that Heather has two mommies-any more than you have to talk about the wedding night when you're showing children your bridal photos.\n \n Far-right lunatics constantly drag children's minds down into the gutter with their own. There's no sex in the charming and beautiful children's book King & King, about a prince who figures out that he'd rather pair off with Prince Charming than Cinderella. Yet Oklahoma lawmaker Sally Kern warned that such books force \"6-year-olds to deal with the issue of sexuality.\"\n \n Really? Did Mrs. Kern's two sons ask her about canine mating after seeing Lady and the Tramp? Is sex what most kids think about after hearing a fairy tale? Or is that just what Mrs. Kern thinks about?\n \n If children need protection, it's from the prejudices and lies of many of their parents. Unless they're carefully taught to be bigots, children couldn't care less who's gay and who's not, who has two daddies or none at all. That's particularly true of children brought up by loving gay and lesbian parents such as those featured in this issue's Gay Parenting 2005 package.\n \n Take Zach, the young man raised since birth by two gay men in Northern California and who graduated from high school last month. When The Advocate called Zach to ask him what it was like growing up with two dads, he couldn't think of anything special to say. They're just his dads-what's the big deal? Bad enough, I suspect, that he had to pose with them for a photo in a dorky commencement robe. I mean, how not cool is that? But having two dads? So what?\n \n The banality of it all could give Jerry Falwell nightmares.\n \n Of course children should be protected. They should be protected from violent or neglectful parents. They should be protected from parents who pass along prejudices that lead to schoolyard bullying and, later in life, hate crimes. They should be protected from parents who reject them or abuse them because of their sexual identity.\n \n In Tennessee there's another teenager, also named Zach (although his identity remains unconfirmed). This Zach recently came out to his parents-who then, he says, sent him against his will to a prison-like antigay deprogramming camp called Love in Action in Raleigh, Tenn. Alerted by Zach's blog (www.myspace.com/specialkid), activists have taken to the streets in Raleigh outside the Love in Action headquarters, demanding that children not be imprisoned for their sexual identity.\n \n Now you tell me: Which child has the better parents? The Zach whose dads are sending a happy, well-adjusted son to college this fall? Or the Zach whose parents have had him locked up?",

   "In Tennessee there's another teenager, also named Zach (although his identity remains unconfirmed). This Zach recently came out to his parents-who then, he says, sent him against his will to a prison-like antigay deprogramming camp called Love in Action in Raleigh, Tenn. Alerted by Zach's blog (www.myspace.com/specialkid), activists have taken to the streets in Raleigh outside the Love in Action headquarters, demanding that children not be imprisoned for their sexual identity.\n\n \n The Zach you speak of came forth later and said that things weren't nearly as bad as people had made it out to be, and that many of the people in the camp were very caring people. \n \n These camps aren't prisons. That gay lobby propaganda talking. If anything, the deprogramming is being done by people who try portray gay relationships as just fine and dandy. THAT'S the deprogramming and brainwashing. The gay pride movement used this kid as a political tool.",

The most important thing should be to show love for the child, even if that means admitting to being wrong, and opening one's mind, and educating one's self, and honestly getting to know who the child is and the child's desires and dreams.\n \n \nSo while raising their kids with the understanding that proper relationships are opposite-sex,\n\n \n There you go again. Appearing \"proper\", should not be what a good parent is concerned about. The good parent should be more concerned with the child, understanding the child, and defending the child against injustice, not \"taking a stand\", or appearing \"proper\".",

   "That can't be done by homophobes. Ignorance and fear and hate must be used, because reason would not tell us homosexuality is wrong.\n\n \n You're may be right about homophobes. But most people simply want to love their kids. I think that most parents definitely DO raise their kids with the values they feel are important and do their best to help them deal with the ones that are hardest. That's probably the biggest challenge of parenting.\n \n \nIt's simply wrong. Why? Because God doesn't like it, and may punish you for it really horribly. It's wrong because you will be seen as not being a \"real man\",\n\n \n Regardless of the arguments pro or con, parents have to parent according to the conscience. It's important that parents love their kids and be there giving support in unfortunate cases where a kid is compelled to do what isn't right. \n \n \nlike when you yourself, jyoshu, scoffed at the idea that gay men could be macho cowboys in the Brokeback Mountain film.\n\n \n I don't think I said that. My response was that it was an obvious effort by gay people to take the most macho thing they could find and use it to further gay-rights ideals. My statements were that I don't like movies with ulterior motives; I didn't say gay men couldn't be cowboys.\n \n \nThe parents are not being moral or patient, if they teach their child there is something wrong with his or her being gay, based on the old and frankly, tired, list of fallacies diversions and lies. Homosexuality is not a disorder, kleptomania is a disorder.\n\n \n Everyone has their view, and that is yours. Theirs are different, and they have to parent according to their consciences. And hopefully they will show love through it all.\n \n \nIt's unfortunate that some don't realize that views on what is right and wrong can change.\n\n \n Depends on the issue. I think there should be some constants. Do you think that the moral view that murder is wrong should change?\n \n \nThat's not the most important thing in this case. The most important thing should be to show love for the child,\n\n \n In standing up for what it right they ARE loving thier child. Loving a kid doesn't always mean agreeing with everything they do. But this is getting more into the realm of parenting than gay rights.\n \n \nThere you go again. Appearing \"proper\", should not be what a good parent is concerned about. The good parent should be more concerned with the child, understanding the child, and defending the child against injustice, not \"taking a stand\", or appearing \"proper\".\n\n \n No, not \"appearing\" proper; BEING proper. Loving their child through tough issues IS the proper thing to do. That IS being concerned about the child. The unconcerned parent would, say, kick a child out for being gay. The loving parent will still love his or her child despite the child's homosexuality and will stand with the child and support the child all his or her life with this unfortunate thing. That doesn't mean the parent has to give up his or her religious and/or moral beliefs. One can stand for something morally and still give love and support even though he or she will not agree.\n \n As I look back, I respect my parents for standing up for what they believed was right.

   "Gay people \"in the closet\" do that too. The problem I have with your movement is that you don't stop with saying \"we should be able to be be out of the closet.\" You go farther and act as though people who want to live a religious life and suppress their gay urges are bad. You fight against THAT too. The very phrase \"in the closet\" is a misnomer--many people \"in the closet\" are just religious people who know gay relationships are wrong and they work to live a different way of life than that. You are making it HARDER for those people, which is no doubt a goal of yours. But it's a selfish one.\n\n \n Preserving the senseless shame of being in the closet about being gay is selfish on your part. Yes, I want to make it more difficult for people to live in shame about being gay. Gay people are okay with you provided we are in the closet and \"properly\" ashamed, or pretending or trying to be something that we are not, either straight or asexual.\n \n \nThe actions and words of people in your movement contradict your innocent-sounding take on things here. I've definitely read hateful things about Christianity right here in these threads, and that IS part of the gay pride movement.\n\n \n An example please. I am sure people are taking issue with the way some Christians and others are biased against homosexuality. It's not a bias against Christianity itself, nor against all Christians.\n \n \nYou know as well as I do that your movement has done some shameful things, from throwing blood in Catholic churches\n\n \n And someone from your movement physically shoved Rev. Brent Hawkes, in the Metropolitian Community Church, as he was about to marry a same-sex couple in Toronto. How do you think Christians would react if they were in the minority, and were having their rights trampled on by the majority?\n \n \nto simulating sex acts in parades.\n\n \n That's not necessarily something to be ashamed of, and it's hardly limited to gay people or the gay rights movement.\n \n \nAnd yes, like it or not, your movement WAS allied with pedophiles early on--it's a verafiable fact. (Though you've long since dropped them, no doubt because of the political damage it caused.)\n\n \n By that logic, so were straight people. It's relatively recently in history, that straight children have not been married. \n \n \nYour movement arose out of gay sex bars--what do you think Stonewall WAS??\n\n \n Well, it didn't. It's been around for much longer than that, and mush broader than bars. However, let's say it did happen in bars. Does that make its goals wrong?\n \n \nThese are FACTS, and I've posted the evidence here before.\n\n \n You've been shown to be wrong with your so-called facts. Your facts are more like one plus one equals five.\n \n \nLook, people know your movement is about sex and sexual defiance. Why lie and pretend it's not that way? Don't you think it would be better to be honest and just stop pretending it isn't?\n\n \n That's a very simplistic view. It's just another one of those extreme right-wing talking points. It's free of any substance or meaning.\n \n \nWhy should I let my kids see men gyrating in a parade or men who would prefer to be a different gender than they are so they dress that way? Why do you expect people to accept that as normal? You can say your way of life is normal, you can even put out movies that make it look innocent, but it's not. Your portrayal of homosexuality of something common and innocent as apple pie is propaganda, pure and simple.\n\n \n These are all rhetorical, repetitive talking points, and ridiculous generalizations once more. Does it make you feel good to paint a minority with broad brush strokes like this, which you, in your highly subjective estimation, consider negative? Does it make you feel powerful? I think it is pathetic. Being gay isn't common, and so what? Your anti-gay bias may be common in some circles, but that doesn't make it right. \n \n \nThe thing is, it's a good thing that most people living a homosexual life are NOT like the gay pride movement, or you'd be in far worse shape. I have a lot more respect for people who are straight up about their homosexuality and what it is than people like you who try to pass it off as something it's not.\n\n \n This is pure bs. Gay people come from all walks of life, and the gay rights movment involves a very diverse group of people, refelcting that.\n \n \nTake Boy George for instance. No, I don't approve or agree with his way of life. He's pretty strange. But at least he's straight up about it and isn't trying to pass off the homosexual life as a Leave It To Beaver episode. He's defiantly sexual, or rather, defiantly homosexual. He's being HONEST in the way he wants to live. Sure, it's bizarre. But at least he's not living a lie. (Although I think I did hear he was dealing with some sort of child molestation charge--if that's true he should be locked up. But that's a different issue than I'm talking about here.)\n\n \n You use a celebrity to generalize about all gay people? That is absolutely ridiculous. I can't think of how boy george is defiantly sexual, recognizing that defiantly sexual is a highly subjective term.",

As to the bible saying so, that is very debatable and left up to interpretation of three or so small verses (BTW if you accept one from Levitius, you should also accept stoning your children to death, not allowing eating of shellfish, and making it abomination to wear poly-cotton clothing).\n \n If you replace everything you say about gays in your statement here with divorce, it becomes much more true. In fact, divorce is much more condemed in the bible than any sort of homosexuality. You see, Jesus specifically condemned divorce, saying that if a person remarries afterwards, they are commiting adultery. For some reason, he never makes a single mention or hint of gays. Ever think there might be a reason for that?\n \nA person should not discriminate others for their sexual orientation, but homosexuality should not be encouraged. Parents have a big impact on a child. Children look up to their parents as an example. Can gay parents really have a positive influence on their child?\n\n \n OF COURSE gay parents can have a positive influence on their child. emoticon_rolleyes Just because you are against them doesn't mean they can't And here you say a person shouldn't discriminate based on sexual orientation and then in the next breath say we shouldn't let them adopts, and ask if they can have a positive influence as if it is impossible for them to.\n \n \n Having two mothers or two fathers is not a good balance in the family. A potentially good family for an orphan should have a mother and a father. Just because the child is an orphan does not mean he or she can be deprived of the chance of having a caring mother and a father.\n\n \n Wow, talk about stereotypical. Ever thought gays might have parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and close trusted friends, that are of the opposite sex and that can easily provide any needed \"role models\" that you claim are needed. Single parents shouldn't be allowed to have children by your logic.\n \n \n No scientific fact has proved that having homosexual parents will not influence a child to become homosexual also. \n\n Total and blatant lie. Here are some links that show you are lying. http://www.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200214.pdf\n and http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/parentschildren.pdf\n \n \nA developing child's mind can be easily influenced, think of all the influential things that everyone's gone through in their childhood. The child will grow up with a more skewered view point on life partnership and marriage.\n\n \n Wow, you seem to be quite prejudiced against gay people. How about<b></b>: \"The child will grow up less prejudiced with a better worldview that realizes there are different people in the world and discrimination is not acceptable, and they will grow up with a more loving view of people\". THAT is what is much more likely to happen, whereas most \"christian\" children grow up with the prejudice of their bigoted parents to twist their view on life (I say \"christians\" because they are not true Christians who follow Christ's teachings, instead they twist the bible to try to support their bigoted views and to have something to hide behind)",

   "I don't think gays should adopt children. Children, for some reason, come out with psycological problems after they had gay parents. The reason behind it is because they don't feel secure. Imagine having two mothers; you don't have a father to guard the house, so the child feels like there's no protection. At the same time, if you have two fathers, you have two people to yell at you all the time, and two people to make you more masculine (although masculinity in gays is pretty rare :D ), and thus you don't get the calmness of the mother. Foster homes may be bad, but we can change them. They can probably inspect homes and make sure the child will get the best treatment available.\n\n \n To me, there is alot wrong with what was said in this post. Its a common belief that a family NEEDS to have a father or male figure at the head to function right. A gay family or a lesbian family would both be able to fuction just as a traditional family. As long as the child being cared for is being given both the \"male\" and \"female\" gender roles, it will turn out just fine. \n A child that is raised by a gay family does not fell secure because of the social pressures on Its family, not those of the parents. The child has to accept that the society It is being brought up in has an intolerance toward the lifstyle of its parents, and sometimes, the child may even be exposed to seeing its parents being heckeled and mistreated by their neighbors.",

HIV/AIDS is extremely common.\n\n Yep but it can be passed by people not gay.\n http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/aids/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\n \n S\nsuicide rates among gays is about six times higher than heterosexuals, and the spread of sexual diseases is so common it causes danger physically and psycologically, and then what else is interesting is that 15% of the new problems today are caused by children of homosexual families, because they are having problems at home.\n \n \n I come from as I mentioned in a different a very relaxed school like area as a child. The school I went to was hippy like almost, I knew quite a few people whose parents were gay , they were my friends the kids and there was nothing abnormally weird. A kid in the grade beneath me whose moms were lesbians he was nice but weird, but a kid in my class whose parents were very straight, he was definetly weirder, and had more problems. The sisters of the kid with the gay moms, they were twins while they were at the school they were pretty nice, and good friends of mine. Not weird or troubled at all, or suicidal , and neither were their moms. Also my uncle is gay and he is not at all suicidal, and no problems at home. His parents were also very straight. How are problems being caused extra by homosexuals? I think main problems by kids these days revolve around gangs and drug wars. How many gang kids or kids in drug wars are gay that you know of I don't know of any?\n \n \n \nAnother issue is abuse. According to the \"Journal of Social Service Research\", a survey of 1200 lesbians, over half of lesbians have physical and verbal abuse by their partners. Why should children have to suffer from the parent's problems? They need a stable family. At any time, the gay father or \"mother\" can leave without notice because he is not married and therefore is not subject to care for the children. \n \n \n Of course and drunk poor men in the slums don't abuse their wives at all , and no one who is straight do not do that. And a stable family does not nessacarily mean someone who is straight. Well whose fault is that they aren't married? And if you are married plenty of people leave too, they can leave way easier. Just because they can leave doesn't mean they will.\n \n \nthis happens to over 15% of the american population!\n\n \n Thats not alot of people\n \n \n \n \nThis was only one of the minor things he had for his problems. How would you like to live a life where you had no gift to give to your mother on mother's day because you had none? How would you feel if your friends all came home after school hugging and kissing their mothers, that you didn't have? How would you feel if you wern't accepted because of your parents errors? I don't think you have any say in deciding if gays should adopt children because you've never experienced it. You simply don't understand the pain that comes with not having a mother or father.\n \n__________________\n I thought he didnt have a father?

At the same time, if you have two fathers, you have two people to yell at you all the time, and two people to make you more masculine (although masculinity in gays is pretty rare :D ), and thus you don't get the calmness of the mother.

I am assuming that the person making these claims came from a heterosexual home with both a mother and father, correct?

My father died when I was 7 years old, and my step father died when i was 13. I now live with my mom and grandma, and you know what? I dont feel like theres no protection. That to me sounds like a 1930's sitcom right there. Where Norma Jean cooks the roast and the man comes home from a hard day at the office, and they eat dinner and he tells her all about the big bad world.\n \n Calmness of a mother? Your mother was obviously never in prison. Mine was. Calm is not the first word i use to describe her. According to your account, she must not be female.\n \n And foster homes are bad. Period. Ya, im sure they could check them all, but were never gonna get that funded correctly, i mean come on, George Bush is the president. Im surprised he can read period.\n \n Ya, ive lost two fathers. One was an alcoholic (that made me feel secure : D)\n And i live with my mom now. Im also in the top 1% of the nation scholastically, and am getting college recruitment letters already. So, please, dont talk when you dont have a real live example.\n \n And btw, im not gay, but my two best friends on this earth are, and actually its the straight people that make him want to kill himself from all the taunting and hatred.

   "Sometimes it's astounding how close-minded people can be about this topic. I have many gay friends raising children... don't see that \"depression\" diagnosis prevelent in any of the children. What makes \"hetero\" parents better than \"homo\" parents?\n \n Most gay people have hetero parents, and relatively happy experiences in their homes. I think the depressions comes from the notion that there is something wrong with being gay...and the hetero couple trying to pass their prejudices upon the object of their prejudice!\n \n My hetero parents were aweful parents. Bigoted, uneducated and violent. They managed to have many children. My 2nd oldest brother and I (the youngest) being the gay ones, the rest hetero. My brother committed suicide due to the emotional and physical abuse bestowed upon him by my mother. When I was in my early teens, my hetero mother beat me so badly for \"being gay\" that I ran away from home.... bloody and barefoot walking in the snow. My doctor actually found me walking and picked me up. Little did I know he was gay and happily partnered for many many years with a wonderful man. They took me in and, after a huge payoff to a crooked judge, ended up my legal custodian for the remainder of my teens.... helped me through the nightmares so so many nights...provided me counselling with qualified professionals... guided me and supported me through attaining higher education. So, basically, my two gay dads saved me from a life of depression. And they raised me into a happy, healthy disciplined man.\n \n It's not the nature of parenting, it's the nurture of parenting. There are good heterosexual parents, and bad hetersexual parents. Believe me, my two dads have been an amazing influence in my life and I would never for one moment say, \"oh, i wish I had heterosexual parents.\" I am happily married to a wonderful man as of January. My dads gave us a wonderful wedding reception here in Germany and sent us on a wonderful honeymoon. My biological mother only hung up on me when I told her the news (despite my financial support of her for the last 10 years). Go figure. She's not my parent. She just gave birth to me, and only that. And now I choose not to have contact with her. \n \n You see, she thought she could beat the homosexual out of me... just like many on this board think they can bible-thump the homosexuality out of us so that we can lay down and be silent. Not gonna happen. You chose to believe in a book of fairy tales to guide your life. I didn't choose to be gay... it just happens folks... !!!\n \n I have many gay friends raising children. Most notably are my two lesbian friends who have managed to raise a brood of 6 (1 set of male twins) all the way through the last one just finishing medical school. Amazing family.. so full of love and joy, highly educated. Kids are so affectionate with each other... even into their 20s/30s. Strange thing, given the statistics of 5 boys and one girl, none turned out gay. So much for that \"you're gonna turn the kids gay theory.\" lol But I compare my brothers children compared with the lesbians children. My brother's children are the ones affected by anxiety, alcoholism and depression, not the lesbians'. These arguments just hold no water....",

And I wanted to ask talk show host O'Reilly about the \"white, Christian, male power structure\" he says he's a part of.\n \n But first Mr. Savage Weiner. His daily syndicated radio show 'Savage Nation' appears on about 350 stations, reaching an estimated eight million listeners weekly. The program is syndicated by Talk Radio Network, which also distributes Laura Ingraham's right-wing chat show.\n \n Savage Weiner was up to his usual, well, savage tricks on Savage Nation last week, again calling gay parenting \"child abuse,\" echoing remarks he originally made during the February 26 program.\n \n This time, Weiner's savagery was unleashed in response to remarks by Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Romney, whose stance on gay issues apparently varies depending on which office he's currently seeking, responded to a mother from New Hampshire who asked about his opposition to gay marriage by referring to same-sex parenting as part of \"the American way\" and an example of \"freedom of choice.\"\n \n Cynthia Fish, a lesbian mother of a 6- and 8-year-old, asked Romney to \"explain to me more, why if we are sending our troops over to fight for liberty and justice for all throughout this country, why not for me? Why not for my family?\"\n \n According to the Associated Press, \"Romney paused, asked Fish about her children and then praised her.\n \n \"Wonderful,\" Romney said. \"I'm delighted that you have a family and you're happy with your family. That's the American way. ... People can live their lives as they choose and children can be a great source of joy, as you know. And I welcome that.\" He then stated his belief that \"Marriage is an institution which is designed to bring a man and woman together to raise a child and that the ideal setting for society at large is where there is a male and a female are associated with the development and nurturing a child.\"\n \n But -- to the dismay of Savage Weiner -- Romney didn't stop there.\n \n \"There are other ways to raise kids, that's fine,\" Romney continued. \"Single moms, grandparents raising kids, gay couples raising kids. That's the American way, to have people have their freedom of choice.\"\n \n To Savage Weiner, however, the only \"proper answer\" for Romney would have been to tell Ms. Fish that her parenting is \"child abuse.\" What is needed, according to Savage Weiner, is \"a conservative candidate all the way who would say to a gay woman: 'You know what? I'm very sorry for your children. I think it's child abuse for you to raise children.' \"\n \n He added that truly conservative candidate would have also said, \"Marriage is a fragile institution and I think you're making a mockery of it in this manner by doing this.\"\n \n Savage Weiner is nothing if not consistent. On the February 26 edition of his show, he said: \"I want to puke when I hear about a woman married to a woman raising children because, frankly, I think that it's child abuse to do that to children without their permission.\"\n \n Among his previous comments, Savage has called a transgender murder victim a \"psychopath\" and a \"freak,\" blamed sexual reassignment surgery for the Columbine massacre, and agreed with a caller that gay rabbis would likely \"rap[e] teenage boys.\"\n \n Savage Nation is the third most-listened-to talk radio show in the nation, behind only The Rush Limbaugh Show and The Sean Hannity Show. There was no response to repeated requests to speak with the program's host. Perhaps the title should be changed to \"Weiner Nation?\"",
