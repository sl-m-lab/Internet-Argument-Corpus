I stand corrected. Then what do you want to do with them. You are very clear that you are happy to restrict the rights of potential criminals.\n \n May I make it clear again, that POTENTIAL CRIMINALS ARE INNOCENT. The only people that have restricted rights in this coutry are CONVICTED criminals. That is a very important point. You must be CONVICTED to be a criminal. If your not convicted you enjoy all the rights of a full citizen.\n \n Using the label \"potential criminal\" is a crime in itself. It is a crime called slander. If you can not prove a person is guilty beyond a resonable doubt with a judge and jurry, then the \"potential criminal\" really is innocent. Restricting the rights of a \"potential criminal\" who is innocent also violates thier civil liberities.\n \n In one swoop you violate several parts of the Constitution and the criminal code.\n \n The innocent in this country should enjoy all the rights of freemen and should not suffer any kind of restriction or government regulation. To be clear again, first you prove a person guilty of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Then you take thier rights away and never before. The innocent should never be changed, affected, or touched by a criminal law. If they are then the law is tyranical. When the innocent are left alone and the criminals punished, then the law is just.\n \n For a further correction I do not think your a Nazi, but from your willingness to restrict the innocent you have proven yourself to be a tyrant.",

A criminal that has never been caught for any of the crimes that he has committed could pass a background check and therefore a obtain license to carry a gun. A terrorist could obtain a license to carry a gun by concealing his identity and his ties to terrorist organizations. So you're making it easier for criminals and terrorists to carry guns on planes.\n\n \n Guess what? Gun ownership is restricted for the people they are trying to push into the sea and into concentration camps. Gun owernship is restricted. People don't own guns in Isreal because the government gives them away for free. The whole purpose of gun control in Isreal is a few soldiers with rifles can enslave a whole city.",

   "\"We are only at the mercy of criminals by the encroachment on our Second Amendment rights\"\n \"My POSITION is that our CONSTITUTION is being encroached\"\n \n So the constituation is being encroached and more specifically the second amendment, correct? \n\n \n You don't think so? My position as outlined in my several posts in regards to the constitution have been backed with examples of the \n trampling of the constitution by our elected officials on both sides of the isle.\n \n Lets go Amendment by Amendment ILIS has spelled this out nicely:\n \n Amendment I\n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. \n \n \"Commercial, sexual, and political speech are increasingly censored. In the name of \"national security\", government employees have been censored for life. To combat pornography, federal and state governments have imprisoned musicians, seized the entire contents of bookstores and video rental outlets, and have even prosecuted museums and art galleries. To \"fight crime,\" hundreds of communities have enacted curfews and \"anti-loitering\" laws. Children who refuse to attend government schools can be imprisoned along with their parents. Freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly are under siege.\" \"\n \n Campaing finance reform\n Patriot Act\n Anti-Smoking regulations\n Voluntary Prayer in public schools\n etc. etc.\n \n Amendment II\n A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. \n \n \" Our right to bear arms is being gradually destroyed as the federal government, the states, and communities enact ever more repressive \n \"gun control\" legislation. California made criminals of over 700,000 of its citizens with the stroke of a pen by banning many popular semi-automatic rifles. To fight government and criminal violence, Americans need the means to defend themselves more than ever, yet we are \n being \"legally\" disarmed.\"\n \n \n Crime Bill\n Brady Bill\n \"assault weapons ban\"\n etc. etc.\n \n \n Amendment III\n No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manners prescribed by law. \n \n \"In Puerto Rico, National Guard troops have been permanently stationed in 54 apartment buildings. Government also destroys our privacy by wire-tapping our telephones, seizing business records and keeping extensive files on most citizens\"\n \n This is a new one for me...\n \n Amendment IV \n The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized.\n \n \" Recent Supreme Court decisions have given the police nearly unlimited power to search houses, businesses and cars - in many cases without a warrant. In Florida, courts have refused to stop police from boarding buses, blocking exits and searching passengers. RICO laws and \"anti-drug\" laws have given government the power to seize all of an individual's or company's assets without indictment or trial. Strip-searching persons arrested for even minor traffic violations is becoming more and more common. Courts and legislatures now consider virtually any government search and seizure \"reasonable.\" \"\n \n Patriot Act\n RICO acts\n \"Rockefeller drug laws\"\n Roving wiretaps\n etc. etc.\n \n Amendment V\n No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. \n \n \n \"The Founding Fathers believed that no one should be indicted without a hearing. Today the IRS can seize your bank account, the FBI can take your computer, the Coast Guard can take your boat, and welfare authorities can take away your children, without any hearing or indictment by a Grand Jury. Increasingly, fundamental legal restraints on the power of government agencies are being abandoned. \"\n \n \n Patriot act\n DYFUS\n etc. etc.\n \n Amendment VI\n In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed; which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and the cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have assistance of counsel for his defense. \n \n \" The United States has adopted the totalitarian practice of imprisoning defendants for long periods before trial. As a growing list of personal behavior and technical errors are criminalized, the court system is being impossibly over-loaded. It now takes years before most serious cases ever get to trial. The growing power of prosecutors, and government seizure of attorneys' fees, are destroying the ability of those accused to defend themselves.\"\n \n Marijuana laws (no I do not smoke marijuana or do any drugs)\n Most if not all \"Mala Prohibita\" laws\n \n Amendment VII\n In Suits of common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law. \n \n \" Less than 3% of criminal defendants now get a trial. Pre-trial detention is growing and some people have been imprisoned for over two years without trial. In direct violation of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has ruled that you don't even have to be given a jury trial if you face less than six months in prison. And if you have a dispute with the IRS, EPA or any of a dozen other regulatory agencies, your case will usually be heard by an administrative law judge employed by the same agency you are disputing. Judges routinely deny the traditional right of jurors to judge the law, as well as the facts of a case, and vote their conscience. Judges and prosecutors exclude any juror who won't agree to convict in advance, stacking juries to ensure convictions. These are precisely the sorts of abuses our Bill of Rights was designed to prevent. \"\n \n \n Speaks for itself....\n \n \n Amendment VIII\n Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n \n \n \" By calling penalties \"civil\" rather than \"criminal,\" government can seize all of your assets without trial or any other form of legal proceeding. Bail has been abolished for virtually all federal crimes, including crimes that didn't even exist as recently as ten years ago, such as \"money-laundering\" and \"structuring.\" Punishments are becoming increasingly harsh. Teenagers are getting years or decades in prison for minor drug offenses. Businessmen are receiving long prison sentences for technical violations of incomprehensible tax laws and securities regulations. Ordinary citizens are being imprisoned for possession of banned literature, guns, and even medicines. \"\n \n \n [b]Amendment IX\n The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. [b]\n \n \"The Constitution and Bill of Rights were intended as strict restrictions on government power. Those powers not explicitly granted to government were retained by the individual. Today the Constitution has been stood on its head. Courts are now saying anything the government wants to do is permissible, unless explicitly prohibited by the Constitution. Government now has nearly unlimited power, and the American people are losing control of their own lives, property, and destinies\"\n \n \n This is the heart of the argument. \"Those powers not explicitly granted to government were retained by the individual.\" This deserves much study.\n \n Amendment X\n The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. \n \n \"Power has shifted from the individual to the states, and from the states to the federal government. Federal aid to states has meant federal control of the states. By including the entire economy under the Constitutions \"interstate commerce\" clause, the Supreme Court has given the US Government control over every aspect of society. \"\n \n \n Portions used from International Society for Individual Liberty \n \n \n \n I can get into many more examples but this should suffice for now. Let me ask you how is the federal government protecting out Bill of rights?",

Arrest the Arabs. They have done nothing. You have to be able to prove it or you have just trashed the Constitution.\n \n Intimindating passagers is against the law. Threating to use deadly force is against the law. Intending to crash a plane with more than one person helping, is against the law, it is called conspiracy. If they are just carrying weapons, then what? If carrying firearms are legalized aboard a plane? Then what? Arrest them? What can you prove? You have to prove that they broke a law or you just trashed the Constitution. \n \n I don't care if the have the words \"terrorist\" tattoo on thier forehead. If they have not broken any law, then what have you done? Restriced the rights of the innocent. If they have done nothing illegal, do nothing illegal, then they are not really terrorist are they. There are laws already on the books if they make threats, consipre, or intimidate people with weapons and deadly force. Then you call the cops, arrest them, and try to prove thier guilt; but never for \"looking guilty\".\n \n Do you or do you not believe in \"innocence until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\"? Or do you make special cases? If you make special cases then you really do not believe it. If you accept special cases where the Constitution can be suspended, then again your trashing the Constitution.\n \n Again I would not restrict the rights of the innocent. If the scene you outlined happened at a security check point, I would not get aboard the plane, and I would not stop them, if NO laws are broken. If you get aboard and you witness the threats and intimidation and do not report what you saw to authorities, then your STUPID and evolution has just eliminated you from the gene pool.\n \n How do you explain arresting your \"terrorist\" to a judge: \"The just look guility\". \"I think they are guilty\". You must be able to swear before God and a judge that you witnessed them conspire the kill people, you witnessed them threaten people, you witnessed them intimadate people with their weapons. If you can not, then they are not terrorist and are innocent. So then if carrying weapons aborad a plane is legal, and they have done nothing wrong, you just trashed the Constitution.\n \n This happend once before in WW2. In the name of public saftey and national security, thousand of Japanese Americans were put in concentration camps and all their property confiscated. Why? \"They look guilty\". \"They might do something wrong, so just incase ...\" Not only where these loyal Americans not guilty, but many of them fought in WW2 while thier families were in camps to become the most decorated units in American Army.\n \n So never again. We learned this once before. Never restrict the rights of citizens unless you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they are indeed guilty.",

Barry McCaffrey, while he was drug czar, claimed that about the Netherlands, as 'proof' that being soft on drugs leads to crime....\n That claim was false about the Netherlands, and it's false about Sweden.... In some European countries, including the Netherlands (and, it appears, Sweden) attempted murder is covered by the same crime-code section as completed murder. So the Dutch have twice our 'homicide rate' as measured by the Interpol numbers, but only one-fifth as much actual homicide. Sweden's actual murder rate is somewhat higher than that, but still only about a third of ours.\"\n http://mkpolitics.blogspot.com/2002_09_01_mkpolitics_archive.html",

They had no idea they would be used to fly into buildings or be hi-jacked at all!

   "I agree 100% that the RIGHT thing to do is follow the Constitution.\n\n \n I didn't ask if it were right. I asked if following the constitution would make life better for everyone. See, I try to follow logic and logic would dictate that if we are going to do something then that something should be beneficial in the long run. I look at your proposal with guns on planes and think even following that alone will cause quality of life to deteriorate. I mentioned this and you stated that you didn't know how to prevent this from being exploited by terrorists. How many other such cases will be created if we followed the constitution to the letter? So regardless of what you think is right or wrong, what is better for America?\n \n \nIf you start with the principles:\n \n 1) It is right to follow the Constitution. No exceptions are made.

It was inspired by the British. The 2nd Amendent with the 9 other in the Bill of Rights is protection against tyranny, not the British.\n\n \n 1) Actually the easy way out is to follow it. Making changes requires work and that is difficult. However if the changes make sense then they tend to be less difficult to make. So perhaps in a way, you are correct here but it only goes to prove my point. Could you define what you mean by right? Is it right because someone told you it is? Is it right because you believe it personally without having to hear anyone say it? Is it right because it is beneficial to America? I tend to believe the right thing to do is what benefits America and the people that live here. Things change and if America doesn't change with the times we will become part of a history book. Is it right to change to keep up with the times?\n \n 2) I'm assuming your stating this as a pro for following the constitution. That is all well and good to some extent. However, if you take it to the extent that your willing to let heavily armed Arabs walk onto a plane, then your leaving a huge hole to exploit in this type of law. If that is done, it is bad for America and isn't that unconstitutional?\n \n 3) Strangely enough my brother just bought a gun today. I had no idea that he was even going to buy one although he had talked about it. I know him well enough to realize he is unstable. He gets depressed and angry frequently and I know he is not a good candidate for having a gun. But with the laws the way they are now there is nothing that is going to make him have to give up his gun. I think the laws are pretty lenient right now and wouldn't want to see them become completely open like you wish for them to be.\n \n Then gun control is fundamentally wrong? Then how about nuke control, is that fundamentally wrong? Shouldn't all nations have a right to protect and arm themselves to the teeth? Living here in the US I bet you can forget how the people in Japan are feeling right now. North Korea isn't playing around when they declared that they are developing nuclear weapons and are willing to use them. Is it fine for them to develop nuclear weapons if we already know they are not fit to handle them in the civilized world? Using this logic, is it fine for questionable people to walk around with an unlimited amount of weapons? Lets say this questionable group is just a common gang like you would see in almost any big city. Half the members are convicted criminals and have no guns and the other half are lackies that have guns but are not convicted criminals. Isn't that a questionable situation? In this case, wouldn't you be at all glad that gun controls are in place and that people cannot walk around with automatics?\n \n \n Concerning the relationship between the British and the 2nd, don't you agree that this law was based on the fact that most of the people who faught the British were not military? That they were just common people and of course since the common people won this war they were put into power. From there spawned the right to have weapons as they had proven to be very useful in this case. They never made this law so that people could fly on planes with them. This law was about protecting the homeland.\n \n \nWhy don't you show me your basic principles and logic that shows that gun control is right? Prove to me your logical.\n\n \n Wow, coming from the person who won't list any flaws in his own ideas. You wouldn't accept anything I can say would you?\n \n Gun control isn't about taking away freedoms, it is about common sense. Since I'm talking about freedom how about I mention that freedom the only thing that matters in this country. The land of the free right? Am I free if I have to go to work everyday just to have enough to eat and a place to live? Probably not. The definition of freedom includes exemption from the power and control of another as well as exemption from necessity, in choise and action. This would mean we should be able to buy anything without working for it if we are truly free. However I doubt you will debate that there is a reason why we cannot be completely free in this type of situation. If we were completely free, it would be anarchy. Anarchy is the lack of laws. Your asking for that on some level with abolishing gun control. There are restrictions on our personal freedoms, we are still able to do whatever we want with our money although if we don't have enough there are certain things we can't do. We are also about to work wherever we want to, as long as we are allowed to by the company. This is similar to what gun control is. We are allowed to have guns if we have a clean record and what we wish to do with them doesn't cause trouble with the rest of society. My parents went to Chile to adopt my sister a few years ago and they encountered many armed guards with automatic weapons in their hands walking down the streets. These were military personal and they said they were scarred to death to go anywhere near those people. Now, lets pretend for a moment that a group of teenagers are walking down the streets of America with those same weapons. Does it make sense that this would cause fear to a vast majority of the people on the streets and pose a threat to our police force as well as all the civilians in the entire area? Of course it does. This is a high security risk. Gun control is about preventing such security risks. How many guys with sniper rifles do you think it would take to send a specific community into chaos if they wished to accomplish this? How hard would it be for terrorists to come to America and buy up enough weapons to kill our President and all his security guards especially if people with guns could literally shake hands with him while showing off their gun? Gun control is necessary or you will have anarchy and I assure you that this type of anarchy is not good for America. It makes no sense at all to allow people to have total freedoms with their weapons simply because they haven't shown themselves to be untrustworthy. People don't need this to be free because as I said earlier, freedom isn't the only thing that matters. To take away personal safety and replace it with the ability to carry weapons around is not making American better.",

The second thing it shows is how lenient gun control is already. I also mentioned this in my last post. Saying that I should have the same attitude as the police is like saying you should have the same attitude as our President in every situation because he is your commander in chief. It is daft and illogical.\n \n Now lets get down to business. I dare you to face the issues and give sound and logical proof that following the constitution to the letter will make life better for America and the American people. But alas, I already know your not willing to focus on the issues. You have proven that all too well.",
