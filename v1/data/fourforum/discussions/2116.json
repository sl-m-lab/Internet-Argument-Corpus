   "Talbott: Gun-rights day of a higher caliber\n March 31, 2004\n \n The College Republicans have declared this Second Amendment Day. They want the university to rescind its gun ban, which applies to everyone including students holding concealed-weapons permits. \n \n It's a good publicity move. Problem is, the College Republicans don't go far enough. The conservative students shouldn't champion only concealed guns on campus; they should also espouse more visible guns on campus. \n \n Just a thought. \n \n At noon in the University Memorial Center Fountain Court, the student GOP will exhort the university to rescind its ban on guns. Students who hold concealed-weapons permits have a Second Amendment right to carry those weapons on campus, says Brad Jones, chairman of the CU College Republicans. \"Unfortunately, your Second Amendment right is abridged by the CU Board of Regents.\" \n \n You might wonder how CU can ban guns. Didn't the state Legislature nullify local gun-control laws last year? Why, yes it did. \n \n Previously, for instance, the city of Boulder banned guns in parks, open space and City Council chambers. Now, people can openly carry loaded guns most everywhere but public K-12 schools. CU's gun restrictions remain effective, because the university has the constitutional authority to make its own rules. And at CU, the rule is simple: Check your gun at the door, Wyatt. \n \n Jones says rescinding CU's no-gun rule would deter crime. \"It's our opinion that the group (that the rule) hurts the most is women, because they're more at risk for violent crimes. The only group the ban actually helps is criminals.\" \n \n At today's rally, he notes, a student from CU's Colorado Springs campus will share her experience. She holds a concealed-weapons permit, and CU gave her an exemption from the weapons ban, apparently because she was able to demonstrate a threat to her safety. Jones argues that it's illogical for CU to grant only some exceptions to the policy. If guns can be used by some students to deter crime, he asks, why can't guns be used by all? \n \n There are good reasons - such as demonstrable threats to personal safety - for people to hold concealed-weapons permits. Seriously. But the open bearing of weapons could accomplish a few things, too. \n \n Across the state, Jones notes, anyone may carry a weapon openly. But at CU, \"You're not even allowed to do that.\" Sure, strolling around campus with a rifle is probably not the best way to make a good impression. But it sure would make an impression. \n \n In the unlikely event that that crazy, liberal Board of Regents rescinds its ban on guns, the College Republicans should make a stronger statement. They should bear arms openly and often. This modest proposal would accomplish several important goals. \n \n First, if conservative students began carting guns to class, they'd be quite visible. Earlier this year, the College Republicans staged a \"coming out day,\" during which conservative students summoned up their courage and announced that they were - gasp! - not liberal. They meant to emphasize that (presumably invisible) conservatives study here, too. With a show of firepower, the conservatives would certainly be visible. \n \n Perhaps even intimidating. The Republicans say they are sometimes persecuted. They say some liberal professors use lecterns as political soapboxes, and they've even sought to pass a law restricting what a professor can say in class. \n \n But imagine the scene: Professor Red Luvver is all set to neglect first-year physics and to expound on the evils of President Bush - and to flunk anyone who disagrees. But a young man in the front row is stroking a Saturday Night Special. The professor opts to stick to the syllabus. \n \n Voil! Conservatives defend the Second Amendment, preserve the First and simultaneously stifle some seriously Marxist mouths. \n \n The effects could be profound. For several eons, conservative lawmakers have bemoaned the liberal atmosphere at CU. Such complaints would evaporate if the campus started to resemble Fort Bragg. \n \n And if lawmakers felt more affinity with the university, perhaps they'd be a little more generous with state funding. Who knows? Maybe Gov. Bill Owens, who now seems to view CU with suspicion verging on contempt, might join the College Republicans for target practice in the Norlin Quad. \n \n These are just a taste of the benefits of making every day Second Amendment Day at CU. Once this idea catches on, it could be hotter than a three-dollar pistol",
