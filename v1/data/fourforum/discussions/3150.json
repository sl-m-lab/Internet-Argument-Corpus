   "(http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/sports/9613753.htm?1c)\n \n \n Typically, Iran pays its gold medalists at the Olympics $125,000. However, one Iran judo wrestler (who carried the Iranian flag at the opening ceremonies) was disqualified for being overweight, but he claims that isn't true and the reason he didn't wrestle was because he refused to wrestle an Israeli Jew. Iran says that the wrestler \"did not get a gold medal, he earned eternal honor by his refusal\" and agreed to pay him $125,000. \n \n Iran does not recognize Israel as a sovereign nation and praised this act by the judo wrestler as one of the best days in Iran's history. \n \n Should we ban Iran from the Olympics for this outrageous act? Why or why not?",

   "First, the Olympics should be without ANY political pressure or influence from any country. Second, who is the \"we\" that should ban Iran from future participation? This sounds like the \"we\" that wants to reshape politics in the Middle East or the \"we\" that ignored world opinion before invading Iraq. Banning countries from the Olympics just deminishes the value of medals won by those who participate. The Olympic Committee is responsible for enforcing the rules, not the United States.",

Why or why not?\n \n Should the US be banned also boycotting the games in the USSR, or all of the former soviet states for boycotting the games in the US? \n Also it is his choice to participate or not, all he did (so he clams) is to remove himself from the games, due to his beliefs, that should not be punished. There is nothing wrong with a person saying \"it is wrong for (insert person / stereotype here) to be allowed to (insert activity here), and I will not be a part of it.\" It would have been wrong if he demanded the removal of another",
