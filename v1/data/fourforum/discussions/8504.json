   "Sassy, you've reminded me just now of a Star Trek episode in which Kirk and Mccoy visit a planet that regularly drops their concern for anybody who is sick since they are not valuable to others without an ability to ward off sickness.\n \n I don't like the way you view people who have no capability to survive on their own. It sounded to me like you said \"Let the sick die and move on to more profitable things\". For as much a pro-lifer as you are, I would think you would show a little more compassion for handicapped people. \n \n I have a friend who has a sister who is a year older than I am, but has a mental condition. (Can't remember the name) I could probably beat her in an intelligence test five times over. She might not be very profitable for society even when she grows up, but her family supports her and loves her. Would you think it justifiable if someone, in the name of society's beneficial interests, went over there and killed her so she wouldn't be draining her family's resources?\n\n \n I am not attempting to express my own views on this issue. I am trying to show how pro-choice people hold a double standard. If the reasons they give for aborting an unborn child are valid, then why don't we hear them attempting to apply these same standards and reasons to the previously mentioned situations. I'll tell you why. Because the people in the previously mentioned situations often have a way to make themselves heard, they can vote, they can do something. Unborn children have nobody to protect them except their mother, and the courts have made it all too easy for a mother to deny her child that protection for purely selfish reasons.\n \n I did not intend to make it appear as though this was my feeling on the subject. I am simply pointing out the double standards that pro-choice people hold.",

   "If you are truly interested in the scientific validity of life beginning at conception than follow this link. http://www.e-forensicmedicine.net/code.htm\n\n \n Scientific validity? Let's take a really quick look at how scientific these people are... [boldface added]\n \n \nEach chromosome is packed with a long string of deoxyribosenucleic acid commonly known as DNA.\n\n That's deoxyribonucleic acid. If they can't even get that right, it's not looking good.\n \n \nThis code is in the form of four chemical bases, cytosine, adenine, thymidine and guanine that are arranged in various sequences ....\n\n That's thymine. Evidently, these guys are ignorant of DNA; thymidine is a nucleoside, not a base.\n \n \nJeffrey's technique known as the restricted fragment length polymorphism method (RFLP) ....\n\n That's restriction fragment, as in DNA cleaved by restriction endonucleases. If these guys were actually educated about RFLP, they'd know what the acronym stands for.\n \n And my personal favorite:\n \nThe important thing to remember is that the fertilized egg or zygote contains all of the genetic material needed to create the fully expressed individual and includes inherent complex encoding for individual human interjection and all the other associated qualities characteristic of human personhood. [emphasis original]\n\n So do skin cells, bone cells, liver cells, muscle cells, and the vast majority of cells in the human body. If I peel off a small piece of skin, but let the cells therein die, have I committed homicide? If I donate a part of my liver to someone needing a transplant, and his body rejects the liver, is it infanticide?",
