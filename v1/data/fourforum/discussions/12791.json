Those captured usually have a distorted sense of The US. They are going to afraid and most likely beleive they will be mistreated. To conform to those perceptions only adds to the credibility of those who recruit our enemy, hardens the captured against us and gives meaning and resolve to those actively engaged.\n \n I am not trying to take a shot at Christians, but maybe this will be better understood by you.

You are a Christian correct? So regretably my 1st post quoting you was well, not well thought out, I blame lackacoffee. In the 2nd, I stated in more abbreivated terms than this- that the thread is about Jesus sanctioning waterboarding and you posted \"waterboarding isn't torture\", and, essentially, it isn't but even if it is the terrorists do way worse. So since you haven't answered the topic of the post and state this, I was seeking what you thought of Jesus personally sanctioning the use of waterboarding which was why this thread began. Perhaps I missed your denial or affirmation of post #1's article? If so, pardon my analogies, which appeared to have angered and confused you regarding my curiosity.\n \n Now in respect to the \"little eye for an large eye\" type of interrogation argument. I.e.- they hurt us worse we only hurt them a little, so we have the moral high ground. I'll drop analogies for a real scenario. The KGB used sensory deprivation tanks to isolate, scare, and with the use of microphones in the tanks, brainwash \"political dissidents\". This left no physical damage and rarely caused death with physician observation who watched for cardiac events and/or strokes. It drove the subject crazy on occasion but you have to break a few eggs to make an omelette. KGB also used isolated, soundproof, windowless rooms and sleep deprivation as well as irregular feeding times to disorient and wear down victims. This gained much the same result as the SDT at a lesser cost, no physical damage, physicians were present, still the chance of insanity. Some of these victims were innocent yet broke and signed trumped up confessions. The Soviet Union had a huge muslim population and a long war with Afghanistan, I suppose they saw the occasional Islamic fundy too. In fact Soviet soldiers captured by mujahadeen (sp?) in Afghanistan had the skin flayed off their bodies while still living (among other atrocities), by Taliban \"freedom fighters\" decades before we landed there. Does this mean the KGB had the moral high ground? For using even less painless enhanced interrogations than waterboarding when possible while their countrymen were inhumanely butchered? Who were those \"when convenient evil enemy\" Taliban fighters with the busy knives not-too-covertly helped by? By virtue of whose help did the Taliban consolidate power for a repressive regime in Afghanistan? Who picked up and bugged out as soon as the Soviets had had enough, because Afghanistan wasn't in the national interest? Oops. And this article uses this they're worse than we are logic to conclude Jesus would approve of waterboarding? Great, I'm sure the Soviet trinity of Marx, Lenin, and Engels would approve of waterboarding a single prisoner 183 times most of those after we'd got the most useful life saving information out of the scumbag.\n \n I'm not happy after 33 years (to answer your question) in the land of the free where we believe every man is created equal, that I have to live with that scenario. And \"that (my) priorities and sense of justice which (are) in serious need of a reality check\" need to be changed to tactics and justifications that are not foaming at the mouth decapitation bad, but nevertheless belong in the USSR.

   "Not at all. What I'm suggesting, and I think is quite obvious is that waterboarding is not torture in comparison to what occurs in the REAL WORLD. It doesn't break bones, draw blood or even cause the recipient to lose consciousness. It scares them for Gods sake!!! \n \n And they don't do it frivolously or to be cruel, but only to enemy combatants whom they believe have information which can help us prevent a terrorist attack.\n \n I mean, if waterboarding is torture then the US Military has tortured virtually every single American service person who has gone through basic training, because they have all been waterboarded in preparation for what occurs if captured by our enemies who will and do, do much worse than that to captured service people.\n\n \n That is odd When I went thru Basic at Ft Leonard Wood MO I wasn't waterboarded. When I went thru AIT Chemical Operations at Ft McClellan AL I went thru a live nerve agent excercise, but no waterboarding.\n \n That's like saying a drag race isn't really a race compared to the Indy 500. Would you waterboard your kids for misbehaving? \n \n The only way to win a war where the goal is anything but complete destruction of the enemy you must win their hearts and minds. Torture only reinforces the perception of the US as evil and immoral. It creates resentment and is a propaganda tool used by the enemy to instigate rebellion.\n \n The information gathered is circumspect and must always by verified, which often isn't immediatley possible. There has never been a ticking bomb scenario and even if there was all the captive would have to do is wait out the hour or day and then he won't be asked anymore or he can tell them 10 minutes before detonation.\n \n We as a nation are supposed to hold ourselves to a higher standard. At least that is what we say when we condemn nations that use tortue. It doesn't matter if we only use it sometimes or we don't use the more violent methods. In the big picture it's far more damaging to us.\n \n It's a popular defense used often, where do you draw the line, at what point and under what circumstances are the actions justified and then not. I mean is it ok if we think a bomb will kill 1, 10, 100.\n \n And finally as happens very often, what if the person is innocent? Do you really think some of these people are going to just forget about going thru this. People get millions of dollars for false imprisonment lawsuites. Some of these people would end up on the top 20 list of holders of US debt if they were allowed to go to court.

You ramble on with your fictional what ifs, as if they have any basis in fact or reality at all, and as if you know how and what I believe. \n \n The fact is that we live in a real world where moral relativity matters. When we use water boarding to gain intel from terrorist combatants captured on the battlefield is treated as a worst crime than when this evil enemy beheads innocent civilians and our soldiers with dull knives, then it is your priorities and sense of justice which is in serious need of a reality check. \n \n \n \n Point out where I have celebrated the murder of this late term abortionist. You can't, because I haven't. What I have rightfully done though is not feel sorrow that his unique willingness to abort viable children is gone forever. The question is, why aren't you equally as offended for the thousands of innocent viable babies this abortionist murdered as you are for his single death? It seems that as usual and in typical fashion your priorities are out of whack once again.\n\n \n Do we allow police officers to torture pediphiles to find the child or see if they know of others? Do we torture kidnappers to learn the location of victims and accomplices? Do we torture murderers to learn the location of the bodies? Do we allow soldiers in the field to rape, plunder and pillage? Are these horrible acts that sometimes warrant execution? \n \n Do I need to answer these questions for you? Do you understand why?\n \n The Papal Inquisitions gave us one fact that without it's activities we would never really be sure of. Detailed records of the reliability of information gathered thru various means of torture was found to be unrealiable. \n \n The treatment of enemy combatants can and has repeatedly been used to strengthen the determination and resolve to oppose thier opponents. \n \n As to the off topic abortion doctor, any loss of life should be met with some sense of grief, whether accidental, necessary, maliciously or in ignorance. We are a country that is trying to be one of fairness. We attempt to allow the majority to live as they see fit without while still protecting common rights of the minority. (Please don't argue here on how succesful we are at doing it. The point is the idea). If you disagree with abortion turning vigilante should not be a solution met with encouragement of even indifference. \n \n This doctor was doing something that he, by the will of the people, was allowed to do. If the will of the people is that abortion not be legal there is a way for that to happen. Many states hearing the concerns of the minority have enacted requirements and standards to abortion. All things considered probably as fair as POSSIBLE.\n \n If the headline read Religuz Rite Homey puts a cap in a Lefty Street Loco for killing members of the Fetus Posse Crew would the emotion be the same as if Religious woman shoots doctor for performing abortions?

Pouring water on someone to save lives is perfectly acceptable IMHO.\n\n \n Afghanistan, late 70's-early 80's the Soviet Union was embroiled in there own version of our Vietnam war. \"Freedom fighters\" arose in Afghanistan who started shooting down Soviet planes and mi-24 Attack helos with the then new Stinger man protable surface to air missile. The Red Army encountered so much resistance from these \"freedom fighters\" they couldn't effectively rule Afghanistan and left. Wow victory even a Rambo movie to immortalize the event. So did the supplier of the wonderful Soviet killing missiles, leaving a war-torn vacuum of a country that these \"freedom fighters\" seized control of by virtue of superior weaponry (I mean Afghanistan is just mountains and goats and butchers, to hell with the people they won't make us richer). Hence the Taliban gov't who after about 20 years of instituting what the post 9/11 US called a \"repressive gov't\" (and it was) and suddenly the former \"freedom fighters\" are deemed part of the \"axis of evil\", invaded in this \"moral crusade against terror\" (how dare the terror we financed 20 years ago come back on our heads, shame on them!). Well looks like thats failed US policy doesnt it? \n \n Don't get me started on failed US policy regarding Iraq since the mid 70's, Iran since the mid 70's, and the repressive gov't in Saudi Arabia (one of the worst in human rights violations) that's America's best friend (how did the Saud faction stay in power? and Osama is part of the Wahabi faction? Hmmmmm).\n \n Point is, Americans seem moral when only on the receiving end of their own world justice. Our hand however big or small in perpetuating the suffering of these people is disregaded instead we say how dare they bring it here? We're righteous. Justification and morality has a wicked backlash.\n \n I figure thats shameful enough but these people fight back and we torture them once again in the name of morality. My friends and neighbors might die, so lets keep making brilliant foreign policy failures that anger them even more.\n This costs us money, time, soldiers, civilian casualties, friends around the world, our credibility, and brings our morals into question.

Why risk our higher ground as a nation, why make matters worse. Did you know that terrorism has in fact increased since 9/11? It all ties back into terrorism.

Tiller case will proceed to trial | KansasCity.com Prime Buzz\n\n \n Jury Acquits Kansas Abortion Provider Dr. Tiller\n NY Times: Jurors Acquit Kansas Doctor in a Late-Term Abortion Case, by Joe Stumpe:\n \n After years of investigations and four days of testimony, jurors here took just 45 minutes on Friday to acquit a controversial abortion doctor of charges that he performed 19 illegal late-term abortions in 2003.\n Kansas law permits late-term abortions when two independent doctors agree that the pregnant woman would be irreparably harmed by giving birth\n \n Prosecutors charged that the doctor, George Tiller, had an improper financial relationship with a doctor from Lawrence, Kristin Neuhaus, who provided a second opinion in the 19 cases cited.\n \n Dr. Tiller's clinic is one of three in the United States that perform late-term abortions, and he has been reviled by anti-abortion forces for decades. \n \n In 1986, a bomb exploded on the roof of his clinic here, Women's Health Care Services. In 1991, some 2,000 protesters were arrested outside during summer-long protests; in 1993, Dr. Tiller was shot in both arms by an anti-abortion activist while driving away from the clinic. Protests continue there almost daily.\n \n emoticon_smile",

   "Afghanistan, late 70's-early 80's the Soviet Union was embroiled in there own version of our Vietnam war. \"Freedom fighters\" arose in Afghanistan who started shooting down Soviet planes and mi-24 Attack helos with the then new Stinger man protable surface to air missile. The Red Army encountered so much resistance from these \"freedom fighters\" they couldn't effectively rule Afghanistan and left. Wow victory even a Rambo movie to immortalize the event. So did the supplier of the wonderful Soviet killing missiles, leaving a war-torn vacuum of a country that these \"freedom fighters\" seized control of by virtue of superior weaponry (I mean Afghanistan is just mountains and goats and butchers, to hell with the people they won't make us richer). Hence the Taliban gov't who after about 20 years of instituting what the post 9/11 US called a \"repressive gov't\" (and it was) and suddenly the former \"freedom fighters\" are deemed part of the \"axis of evil\", invaded in this \"moral crusade against terror\" (how dare the terror we financed 20 years ago come back on our heads, shame on them!). Well looks like thats failed US policy doesnt it? \n \n Don't get me started on failed US policy regarding Iraq since the mid 70's, Iran since the mid 70's, and the repressive gov't in Saudi Arabia (one of the worst in human rights violations) that's America's best friend (how did the Saud faction stay in power? and Osama is part of the Wahabi faction? Hmmmmm).\n \n Point is, Americans seem moral when only on the receiving end of their own world justice. Our hand however big or small in perpetuating the suffering of these people is disregaded instead we say how dare they bring it here? We're righteous. Justification and morality has a wicked backlash.\n \n I figure thats shameful enough but these people fight back and we torture them once again in the name of morality. My friends and neighbors might die, so lets keep making brilliant foreign policy failures that anger them even more.\n This costs us money, time, soldiers, civilian casualties, friends around the world, our credibility, and brings our morals into question. And no I'm not a leftist, or a conservative, it doesn't matter anyways they both chewed the pooch. Lives of Americans are worthwhile enough to torture the same people we have oppressed with our political backstabbing? How much bloods on our hands? Ask a Kurd.\n\n \n What is it about you flaming leftists that you can corrupt and twist any historical facts in such a way as to demonize the good guys? And by good guys, I mean US. \n \n The reality is that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan had absolutely nothing in common with Vietnam at all so your claim that it was the soviets version of our Nam is just inane drivel with no basis in fact at all. What Afghanistan was, was a massive land grab by a totalitarian government which saw the natives as weak, unsophisticated technologically, and poor. They saw the opportunity to overwhelm this impoverished country with their military power and then control whatever natural resources/OIL they could harvest from the land.\n \n One of their most infamous techniques for demoralizing the average afghani was to drop booby trapped toys out of helicopters so innocent children would pick them up and blow hands off and otherwise seriously and permanently wound them without actually killing them. They fire bombed complete villages from the air without ever looking the victims in the eye.\n \n Enter Ronald Reagan who saw the carnage taking place and he supplied the Muhajadeen with hundred thousand dollar stinger missiles which were able to take out 100 MILLION dollar Russian Choppers and Migs in short order. All of a sudden the cost was becoming too high for the soviets when they saw that comparable technology brings comparable results.\n \n Now tell me, what was wrong or evil for us to aid these people who had no chance of defending themselves before we leveled the playing field? And in what world would you ever expect those same people to say thanks by turning those weapons on us 20 years later? \n \n America may have been guilty of being gullible and naive, but never were we imperialistic in our desire to invade other lands and force them to exist according to our laws and constitutional ethic. The evidence of that is found in afghanistan itself in that we never imparted our way of life on them at all. Only in the warped mind of the loony leftists can America be blamed for doing the right and moral thing at the time, and demonized for the irrational decisions made by a people we personally saved from being over run by the USSR.",

I had no idea your self image was so terribly weak that my accurate characterization of you would send you over the edge to self destruct. \n \n \nMy whole point is that the afghans were wronged by america, who could have continued support and/or at the least kept the murderous thugs we used so obviously from taking over the country and opressing these people. Instead silence.\n\n \n The afghans weren't wronged by America! They were saved by us when they needed help the most and NO OTHER COUNTRY ON EARTH CAME FORWARD TO HELP THEM. And here's the rub, on another debate, you leftists will criticize american imperialism for forcing ourselves on Iraq and Afghanistan today by not just rescuing them from their enemies, be they the Taliban, Al-Qeda or Saddam, and getting out of there. You say we are intruding on their culture and abandoning our historic principles of not intruding on a culture and forcing americanism on another people. \n \n But when Reagan did precisely that! Went in and gave them the materials needed to defend themselves from being overtaken and dominated by the Soviets, you now say in hindsight that we should have done precisely what you are condemning us for doing in the present. We cannot win with the leftists who will first criticize, then condemn america at every turn, no matter what we do. Until of course we completely submit to the evil which seeks to dominate us and the people become powerless and voiceless paupers who are completely silenced, mindless unquestioning robots who blindly follow the will of the leftist power elite which the democrats who you trust will undoubtedly be if they get their way.\n \n \n And you prove my point here \"America needn't be 100% right in a world of gray areas and where national self interest is a cold hard reality which you will evidently accept for every other country except your own.\" No, I'm aware of this. Im saying america has the responsibility to lead by example and failed. Now we demonize these people, and wonder what the lambs ever did to the lions. Now we say they do worse to us, by jove let's ratchet it up. What garbage, I'm not so wrapped up in american superiority that I can ignore the wrong we did, and instead call these people subhuman and not treat them accordingly to our own rule of law, and for this I am guilty of all your insults? I think someone should empty your bag of chips, cause your not all that.\n\n \n The problem with you and your ilk is that you have tunnel vision. You are either incapable of seeing both sides objectively or are being brainwashed by the sources you rely on for the info which corrupts what you believe to be true.\n \n You see, in the real world, every country has their national self interest to consider first and foremost. If america considered what was best for everyone else before what was best for its citizens we wouldn't be the current world superpower with the largest target on our head as we do. THAT IS CALLED REALITY JWF. I HOPE THAT FACT DOESN'T SEND YOU OVER THE EDGE AGAIN. \n \n So Reagan assisted the afghanis by supplying the arms they needed to fight off an invading nation. The afghans already had the will, they just needed the where with-all. How could he have ever foreseen that islam would become radicalized in 20 years with an ideology to either convert the world to islam or destroy any and all who opposed that agenda. Because when all is said and done that is what radical islam is about whether you liberals can see it or not. So Reagan didn't fail at all, he acted according to the current understanding of the time. And he took great personal political risk in aiding the afghanis as he did. Are you aware of the congressional hearings held by the DEMOCRATS which attempted to charge him with crimes for sending the arms to Afghanistan which saved them? That history isn't important to you is it? Now, back to the radicals...\n \n There is no call for summits or calls for negotiated peace from these violent radicals. They have given us the options in the fatwas which they signed in blood. EITHER CONVERT TO ISLAM AND SUBMIT TO ALLAH, OR DIE! That is the choice they offer. I was born into islam and have family members who live in the middle east, as we speak. I know first hand how the arab mind works and how islam justifies deceit, lying and betrayal if it leads to defeating ones enemy. I know that these militants will gladly kill 10,000 faithful moslems in the process of killing 10,000 so called infidels. The reason for this is that they believe they are just sending the 10,000 faithful moslems to paradise as martyrs for allah as they send the infidels to hell.\n \n Now, what does this tell you about this enemy JWF? It tells me that this ideology has absolutely NO respect for human life at all. There is nothing Godly or Holy about the god they allege to worship and serve. They target innocents purposely for murder and mayhem on a world wide scale in order to terrorize and intimidate the planet into submitting to their unholy demands. \n \n And you liberals are so easily distracted that you can only look at us and blame our government once again and always for the crimes against humanity which these murderers commit on a world wide scale. So forgive me for not handling you with kid gloves. But as far as I'm concerned, as long as you are either so willfully ignorant, or deluded that you continue to blame the victims for the crimes of the murderers, then you deserve to be treated as harshly as you are treating the country which gives you the freedom to spew your anti american trash without fear of being picked up as you would be if you lived in the middle east and dared to speak against the enemy you are ignoring as you condemn our country. \n \n Just one more thing, you will find like minded anti american jerks here who will align with you in every debate as long as you continue to condemn America while ignoring the geopolitical realities in the world we must navigate as a nation today. Just remember that we have a president in Obama now who is everything the extreme socialist leftist could want, So when we are destroyed as a nation in one hours time, as it finally hits you that the incredible beacon of freedom and light which was the america that existed when your parents were born is gone forever, and even if you survive the initial blast that your life wont be worth living; just remember that you wont be able to blame the republicans. It will all be on Obama and the democratic majority.",

It will all be on Obama and the democratic majority.\n\n \n So I ask you to quit flaming and you condescendingly refuse then wonder why you get a paragraph back? Shudders call a moderator. In the what 3 times this has gone around you went from how we bravely helped the Afghans, to well America wasn't and didn't need to be 100% right but thats of no consequence, back to we bravely helped the Afghans. We helped them to help the Soviets lose- period. I won't argue in circles. I won't be referred to as a socialist by someone who hasn't even looked up the few posts I've written. Good God towing the partisan conservative mindless junk is at least as dishonest as accusing me of spewing the looney leftist line. Bush is right? Obama is a socialist dream? They both are socialist dreams. Neither of them is fiscally responsible, they both pander to the Saudi's (at least Obama isn't in business with them like daddy and Jr.), and for God sakes who started this bailout madness and socialist trend? Bush. Uh oh. How could he know Obama would nationalize it from there. Yawn. Do you think Obama would have been elected without conservative/Christian votes? Do you think abortion bans would be voted down without conservative/Christian votes? Do you think the gays you bash all over this place mercilessly have the rights you'd take away from them without conservative/Christian votes? Hypocrite, don't preach that slimy political line to me, while shallowly assuming I'm a leftist, it gives you the credibility of Larry Craig. \n \n Further your holy war on Islam is disturbing. Your diatribe sounds like kill them all before they kill us. And frankly I know what Islam is I have spent over a year in Israel at a time more than once, I've seen the bombings, heard the Katushas, I got handed an Uzi once and thank God I didn't have to use it. As far as a people goes I've rarely met a nicer people. They really seriously want to know God and serve Him, I don't believe in their god nor their book but I made Muslim friends there that I still enjoy debating with and witnessing to. I met plenty of Muslim Christians and I am still honored to know them. I also met the radicals on many occassions and have rarely feared more for my life. But God was with me. I take offense to demonizing these people and I don't care if they were your people. Don't you ever quote a post by me again and demonize Muslims as a people. Oh I know you said radicals then expanded to villify the religion and ideology, then follow it up nicely with a nuclear scenario, death for Islam or us hey? Hateful garbage and just as bad as the rhetoric they recruit terrorists with. That's as sickening as Jewish kapos in Nazi death camps that helped opress fellow Jewish inmates for leniency and extra moldy bread crumbs. I DO NOT CARE HOW BAD THESE PEOPLE ACT THAT DOESNT GIVE US THE RIGHT TO TORTURE AND KILL THEM ALL. Or to think America is so snow white clean muslims have nothing to complain about, as if we haven't turned a blind eye when it could have gone far towards curbing terrorism and oppression.

   "So I ask you to quit flaming and you condescendingly refuse then wonder why you get a paragraph back\n\n \n I'm sorry that you're so weak that you take any honest criticism of what you represent to be flaming. But I don't know how to debate your ilk without calling a spade a spade.\n \n \nFurther your holy war on Islam is disturbing. Your diatribe sounds like kill them all before they kill us. \n\n \n You condemn me for labeling you a leftist when all you do is respond like a leftist by taking my honest criticism of radical islam and then deducing that I am endorsing killing them all. See why it's so easy to peg you for what you represent?\n \n \nAnd frankly I know what Islam is I have spent over a year in Israel at a time more than once, I've seen the bombings, heard the Katushas, I got handed an Uzi once and thank God I didn't have to use it.\n\n \n Then you know first hand that the vast majority of arabs just want to live in peace with Israel, but it's the radicals who refuse peace at all cost. So why are you disagreeing with me and attempting to paint me as someone who hates all moslems when my own family is of islamic descent? \n \n \n As far as a people goes I've rarely met a nicer people. They really seriously want to know God and serve Him, I don't believe in their god nor their book but I made Muslim friends there that I still enjoy debating with and witnessing to. I met plenty of Muslim Christians and I am still honored to know them. \n\n \n Agreed on all counts. I know the heart of most moslems is no different than that of all other people who just want to live lives of peace and security without fear from an oppressive government. Sadly though, most moslems who live in islamic countries don't have the freedom to think and believe as we do without fear of violence from those who wield the power in their communities. \n \n \nI also met the radicals on many occassions and have rarely feared more for my life. But God was with me. I take offense to demonizing these people and I don't care if they were your people. Don't you ever quote a post by me again and demonize Muslims as a people. Oh I know you said radicals then expanded to villify the religion and ideology, then follow it up nicely with a nuclear scenario, death for Islam or us hey? \n\n \n Here is where you blow it again by expanding what I said to mean something I never said at all. Quote where I said death to islam, or us, or that we must nuke and kill ALL MOSLEMS. Go on, show where I said any of the dishonest drivel you attribute to me.\n \n \n Hateful garbage and just as bad as the rhetoric they recruit terrorists with. That's as sickening as Jewish kapos in Nazi death camps that helped opress fellow Jewish inmates for leniency and extra moldy bread crumbs. I DO NOT CARE HOW BAD THESE PEOPLE ACT THAT DOESNT GIVE US THE RIGHT TO TORTURE AND KILL THEM ALL. \n\n \n Again, like a good extremist who must lie about the opposition, you accuse me of condoning or calling for the right to torture and kill them all because of the 1 or 2% of radicals among them. So go on and post my call for this action. Show where I said these things in any way you liar.\n \n You see why I am unable to respond to you with respect? It's because you can't interpret what I say honestly in any way. You must exaggerate what I say in order to interpret it to be as violent and evil as you can in order to demonize me. This tells me that you prefer the lie to the truth. \n \n \nOr to think America is so snow white clean muslims have nothing to complain about, as if we haven't turned a blind eye when it could have gone far towards curbing terrorism and oppression. We didnt even touch Iraq or Iran and our failed policys there. \n\n \n \n When did I say America is snow white? Post where I said that. I actually said that \"like\" every country on Earth, our government seeks to protect its own interests first. That's reality, not that we always do the best thing for others. But we did do the right thing for Afghanistan by arming them so they could defend themselves against the soviets. Your condemnation of us at every turn is the lie which the left tells at every turn where our government is concerned. As you ignore the sins and self interest which every other country on earth exhibits at every turn. That reality seems beyond you to grasp or appreciate as you aid our enemies in condemning us as if we set out to do the most evil and intrusive thing possible. You become the friend of our enemies by repeating the propaganda and lies they tell. Therefore you are no better than those enemies whom you aid by spewing the hate you so proudly speak against your own country. \n \n \nNot to mention the arguably largest muslim sponsor of terrorism- Bush's best buddies the Saudis. A country that won't even allow Christian bibles much less Christianity or basic human rights. Bush kept a Koran given to him by the Saudi's in the White House (do you think they would have loved a Christian bible in return seeing that Bush is Christian- no), how quaint, I think Obama keeps a Koran too. \n\n \n Do you think I'm here to defend Saudi Arabia in any way? You would be wrong. This is another example of your inability to accept the geo-political realities which exist in the real world though. We live a country which is a finely tuned machine which keeps running because of the oil and its byproducts which lubricate the gears of our industry and infrastructure. \n \n Then add to that reality, the environmental whackos who have and will fight drilling for, and harvesting our own massive oil deposits which could give us oil independence from the M.E. within a decade. And then we have your buddy Obama who just announced this morning that he can live with Iran making nuclear power for peaceful purposes but opposes Nuclear power plants in America at all cost. Google \"France's Nuclear Power Program\" for an education of how safe the technology is today and how far behind other western countries we are in utilizing this clean and safe energy. Here's a start for you: French Nuclear Power: WNA\n \n So since I have explained reality once again to you, would you spit in the face of the person who held your very economic, industrial and social survival in their hands? I think not, not unless you were once again suicidal. So what would you propose we do about the Saudi's since you have all the complaints but no solutions to offer?",

So why are you disagreeing with me and attempting to paint me as someone who hates all moslems when my own family is of islamic descent? \n\n You need to replace your Pat Robertson the CIA should assasinate Hugo Chavez rantings with some common sense and Christian love and honesty and here's why. \n \nThere is no call for summits or calls for negotiated peace from these violent radicals. They have given us the options in the fatwas which they signed in blood. EITHER CONVERT TO ISLAM AND SUBMIT TO ALLAH, OR DIE! That is the choice they offer.\n \n Fear them.\n \nI know first hand how the arab mind works and how islam justifies deceit, lying and betrayal if it leads to defeating ones enemy.\n \n I'm sure were all wondering why you generalize here instead of saying how the militants twist there own scriptures. Law of Abrogation or not, not all Arabs run their lives by this.\n \nI know that these militants will gladly kill 10,000 faithful moslems in the process of killing 10,000 so called infidels. The reason for this is that they believe they are just sending the 10,000 faithful moslems to paradise as martyrs for allah as they send the infidels to hell.\n\n Fear more.\n \nIt tells me that this ideology has absolutely NO respect for human life at all. There is nothing Godly or Holy about the god they allege to worship and serve.\n\n Fear a lot. I hope you mean the ideology of the mullahs that recruit young Arabs to do the bombings they are too cowardly to do, instead of lumping all Arabs together like above. \n \nThey target innocents purposely for murder and mayhem on a world wide scale in order to terrorize and intimidate the planet into submitting to their unholy demands.\n \n Fear fear fear.\n \nthen you deserve to be treated as harshly as you are treating the country which gives you the freedom to spew your anti american trash without fear of being picked up as you would be if you lived in the middle east and dared to speak against the enemy you are ignoring as you condemn our country.\n \n Actually I've been there and done far worse I've witnessed for Christ.

Let's just continue with the unclear generalizations above and turn it into this they're going to do worse than we do again. We're justified. Why don't we invade them all? Why don't we treat them like the Canaanites you've called them elsewhere? Why don't we wipe them out using Joshua. Something even Israel couldn't do. I know the rhetoric and I know where it leads. And I'm not dumb enough to let it fly. \n Second, why shouldn't I be contemptuous of this ongoing hypocrisy fest? You haven't answered the question I posted several posts back which is the topic of this whole thread. \nBack to the drawing board I wont use any analogies this time if that helps you. In a thread concerning an article made by a Christian claiming that Jesus would sanction waterboarding you stated...Naturally, this provokes my curiosity. You are a Christian correct? So regretably my 1st post quoting you was well, not well thought out, I blame lackacoffee. In the 2nd, I stated in more abbreivated terms than this- that the thread is about Jesus sanctioning waterboarding and you posted \"waterboarding isn't torture\", and, essentially, it isn't but even if it is the terrorists do way worse. So since you haven't answered the topic of the post and state this, I was seeking what you thought of Jesus personally sanctioning the use of waterboarding which was why this thread began.\n So, I assume by virtue of your silence you think something we sent a Japanese soldier to prison for 15 years in 1947 and labeled it a war crime is something we ought to do right now? And that Jesus would sanction it. \n \nWhen did I say America is snow white? Post where I said that. I actually said that \"like\" every country on Earth, our government seeks to protect its own interests first. That's reality, not that we always do the best thing for others. But we did do the right thing for Afghanistan by arming them so they could defend themselves against the soviets. Your condemnation of us at every turn is the lie which the left tells at every turn where our government is concerned.

You become the friend of our enemies by repeating the propaganda and lies they tell. Therefore you are no better than those enemies whom you aid by spewing the hate you so proudly speak against your own country. \n\n \nWhat is it about you flaming leftists that you can corrupt and twist any historical facts in such a way as to demonize the good guys? And by good guys, I mean US.\n\n One other commented on this gem. There's your liberal conspiracy, Mr. Gibson.\n \nOnly in the warped mind of the loony leftists can America be blamed for doing the right and moral thing at the time, and demonized for the irrational decisions made by a people we personally saved from being over run by the USSR.\n\n \nThe afghans weren't wronged by America! They were saved by us when they needed help the most and NO OTHER COUNTRY ON EARTH CAME FORWARD TO HELP THEM.\n\n \nSo Reagan didn't fail at all\n\n \nthen you deserve to be treated as harshly as you are treating the country which gives you the freedom to spew your anti american trash without fear of being picked up as you would be if you lived in the middle east and dared to speak against the enemy you are ignoring as you condemn our country.\n\n \nas it finally hits you that the incredible beacon of freedom and light which was the america\n\n Getting the idea, you liar? \n \nDo you think I'm here to defend Saudi Arabia in any way? You would be wrong. This is another example of your inability to accept the geo-political realities which exist in the real world though. We live a country which is a finely tuned machine which keeps running because of the oil and its byproducts which lubricate the gears of our industry and infrastructure. \n\n So we can support opressive gov'ts, if it suits us? And OBL doesn't see that as justification? Of course not poppycock! This isn't relevent to letting thugs run Afghanistan without doing a thing to prevent it, just because they didn't own squat that we could exploit. Not in any way.\n \nThen add to that reality, the environmental whackos who have and will fight drilling for, and harvesting our own massive oil deposits which could give us oil independence from the M.E. within a decade. And then we have your buddy Obama who just announced this morning that he can live with Iran making nuclear power for peaceful purposes but opposes Nuclear power plants in America at all cost. Google \"France's Nuclear Power Program\" for an education of how safe the technology is today and how far behind other western countries we are in utilizing this clean and safe energy. Here's a start for you: French Nuclear Power: WNA\n\n Way to still disguise your partisan regurgitations. You know if I were bashing Carter or Clinton or Obama you'd say nothing of the sort and just agree like the conservatist puppet/sheeple you really are. Yet you defend Reagan and both Bush's as if its a national duty, what hypocrisy you think anyone with a high school equivalency test education would be swayed by that argument unless they already agreed with you? And You wonder why I don't except a word of your purely partisan tirades? \n \nSo since I have explained reality once again to you, would you spit in the face of the person who held your very economic, industrial and social survival in their hands? I think not, not unless you were once again suicidal. So what would you propose we do about the Saudi's since you have all the complaints but no solutions to offer?\n\n You just spat in Obama's face, oh great one. So, why don't you go you sit in the president's seat, you and I know you want to. I know your hypocrisy will lead the world down the same old slope. You know that anyone that doesn't bow to your religious/political views is doomed anyways. Great Armageddon recipe.",

YOU FAILED AS GOD.\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n The problem with your god is your claims of him being an all knowing, all loving, and all powerful creator. He could be like Aunt Clara on \"Bewitched.\" She was the nicest lady, but she would inevitably speak the wrong words while casting a spell and all hell would break loose. But she always tried her best to remedy the situation. You couldn't help but love her, no matter what happenned as a result of her somewhat challenged magical powers, her heart was always in the right place. A very humble and unassuming character. Just the kind of personality that most mortals seem to warm up to.\n Since god is created by man, just like the characters on \"Bewitched\", god could have been written like Aunt Clara. Unfortunately they wrote him like Endora. A scowling, bruding, self riteous, egotistical maniac. Who finds joy and humor in the suffering of mortals which she has deliberately caused.\n Sound familiar?",

   "Whether or not man has free will vs. predestination is quite a fight. Although a change in belief requires a changing of will, when we pray for God to change someone's view (be it a conversion, doctrinal change, change of attitude, etc.) what we're really asking is for God to intervene and change the will of the person. And obviously, those with faith believe prayer works. My belief is it's not either/or but both/and. Citing Pharoah as well as Romans 8:30 tempers the free will argument a bit. To paraphrase Spurgeon free will vs. predestination are like parallel railroad tracks stretching past the horizon, never crossing. According to him they meet at the Throne of God.\n \n As far as why sickness/sin/death/holocausts/innocents dying/disease/bad breath/slavery/rape/incest/suffering/accidents/athlete's foot is allowed in this world by a perfect God, I believe it's because of John 3:16- For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. He, after all was the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). Also Matt. 13:35 (may allude to IMO), John 17:24, Eph. 1:4, Heb. 4:3; 9:26, 1 Pet. 1:19-20. God allowed sin, consequences thereof, and death and gave us His Son (of whom the Levitical sacrifice foreshadowed) as His ultimate expression of love for humanity. \n \n And yes God has always been responsible for the evils that happen in this world. He took them upon Himself and died in payment for them. Since he was slain before the foundation of the world, he always has been and always will be. \n \n I know love it or leave it. It's impossible for me to rationalize as well. I certainly will not maintain rejecting my views is a one way ticket to hell. emoticon_frazzled",

Not being a Christian for example. If you step on that mine, you will suffer for all eternity. Your God knows from the start who is not going to be a Christian, which is essentially allowing them to do it. Now we ask, did God make them do it? Since God made them with information already available, then yes, God did make them do that. What was the point of Adam and Eve? When God knew ahead of time that the woman he created from a rib bone was going to eat from a tree and throw everything into \"fall\" mode, that makes God completely responsible for all events that have taken place. As a result all mankind must seek salvation from a world they had no choice in being born into. How about applying free will to people before they are born? Giving them a choice of whether or not they want to take a chance on being part of the rat race. Let them know ahead of time that by consenting to become a human being on this planet what could and probably will happen to you before death. Explain to them what life is like when you are handicapped. Explain how life can be enjoyable for some, but with the knowledge that an inevitable death awaits all. Explain how accepting the religious beliefs of the family you are born into can send you to hell, if they are not the \"right\" ones. Explain how accepting the non-religious views of the family you were born into can also send you straight to hell. Explain how you might not be sent straight to hell if you have never ever ever ever heard the gospel or the name Jesus Christ. Explain how you WILL be sent to hell if have never ever ever ever heard the gospel or the name Jesus Christ, but you are homosexual.\n So free will if you want to call it that would have to begin before we pop out of the womb. I am afraid if given that choice, God would not have many contestants on his \"reality T.V.\" show.\n If you want to talk about love, compassion, forgiveness, etc, please do not include your God in the same sentence.",

The fact that he suppossedly knew about the fall because of mankinds imperfect nature makes him either a fool or a masochist. It's one thing for a human being to create something and be unsatisfied with the outcome. It's entirely another issue for God to manufacture a faulty product, especially when he knew it was faulty. Cain killing Able was the red flag for a total product recall. No product recall, instead God sends Cain packing where he finds a wife and procreates to the point where God has to wipe them all out with a flood. Meanwhile he pissses and moans about the sinful nature of his children, that he already knew would have a sinful nature. That behavior is true of most parents. I find it hard to buy that God in his infinite wisdom is no better and in many cases not as good as human beings with their children.\n \n \n Archangel:\n You seem unaware that the laws which regulate Gods relationship with humanity and all living things are as absolute as the laws of physics such as gravity which is also absolute and unbending in its application to our world. \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n You seem unaware that there is no evidence that shows that besides your belief.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Are you suggesting that because God did see all of the mistakes humanity would make before He even created us, that He never should have created life in the first place? \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Great question and I would have to say yes.

Despite the numerous intentional and untintional additions and subtractions including those in the Old Testement which thankfully Christians realized The chosen people of God, The Jews who got it directly from God had somehow, made some mistakes which have been corrected by the faithful.\n \n I sure would not want to be Paul if he got it wrong. \n \n Try telling a roomfull of women libbers they don't have any free will choices.\n \n Why what would happen?",

Now go ahead and tell how God is not making a decision for anyone. And if God decides to send you to the slums of Ensenada, he also made some financial decisions for you as well. If he decided to send you to China, and your a baby girl, he decided that you should either be abandoned or aborted or both. Which brings up another pertinent observation. When God knows what babies will be aborted why does he allow the mothers to conceive? Is this not the same God that knocked Mary via the Holy Spirit? If God magically caused Mary to conceive, he should certainly be able to cause other mothers NOT to conceive. God's silent indifference concerning abortions creates a demand for the Dr. Tillers of this world.",

There is sustantial evidence, evidence that goes beyond reasonable doubt, that much of what makes up Christianity today was added well after Christ died, was in response to threats from internal and external alternative beliefs, was politically motivated, was a result of ignorance in science and history and was intentional for personal gain. That doesn't necessarily mean that there is no God or that Jesus didn't exist.

I mean, can you be any more vague in your opposition stance? Or are you afraid that if you are too specific you will embarrass yourself by revealing how ignorant you are regarding the messianic prophecies which Jesus represents?\n\n \n Let's see how badly Archangel Fails:\n \n 1) Isaiah 1:26: \"And I will restore your judges as at first and your counsellors as in the beginning; afterwards you shall be called City of Righteousness, Faithful City.\" Some Jews interpret this to mean that the Sanhedrin will be re-established. (Isaiah 1:26\n \n Nope. Doesn't exist currently, and previous attempts have all had significant issues particularly in finding acceptance in Israel. \n \n 2) Once he is King, leaders of other nations will look to him for guidance.\n \n Jesus is King? Huh. Where? \n \n 3) The whole world will worship the One God of Israel (Isaiah 2:11-17\n \n I'm not sure I need to even state how that doesn't exist\n \n 4) He will be descended from King David (Isaiah 11:1) via Solomon (1 Chronicles 22:8-10. 2 Chronicles 7:18\n \n This one is a potential, primarily because Mary is allegedly decedent from David. But Christ is Sinless. So how can he be decedent from those who are tainted by original sin? That makes no sense. If Christ's Sinless trait takes precedent, he cannot be a decedent of David.\n \n 5) The Moshiach will be a man of this world, an observant Jew with \"fear of God\" (Isaiah 11:2)\n \n But Christ wasn't a man of this world, but a corporeal form of God. So much for that. \n \n 6) Evil and tyranny will not be able to stand before his leadership (Isaiah 11:4\n \n Really. One needs merely to look around to know that's bunk for Christ\n \n 7) Knowledge of God will fill the world (Isaiah 11:9) \n \n Huh. There are still plenty of people ignorant of Christanity, much less other religions and Gods\n \n 8) He will include and attract people from all cultures and nations (Isaiah 11:10) \n \n Fair enough, I'll give you this one. It's vague enough though to include a number of historical prophets.\n \n 9) All Israelites will be returned to their homeland (Isaiah 11:12)\n \n I got a Jewish neighbor. And I don't live in Israel. FAIL.\n \n 10) Death will be swallowed up forever (Isaiah 25:8\n \n LOL. No Commentary Needed\n \n 11) There will be no more hunger or illness, and death will cease (Isaiah 25:8\n \n .....emoticon_rolleyes\n \n 12) All of the dead will rise again (Isaiah 26:19)\n \n Unless the government has been doing a super good cover up, There hasn't been a Zombie infestation lately. \n \n 13) The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness (Isaiah 51:11)\n \n Huh. Last I checked, the Holocaust came after Jesus Arrival. Eternal Joy and gladness = Mass murder? Huh.\n \n 14) He will be a messenger of peace (Isaiah 52:7) \n \n Perhaps, I'll give you this one. But again, it's vague enough to include people like Obama as the Jewish Messiah. emoticon_xgood\n \n 15) Nations will recognize the wrongs they did to Israel (Isaiah 52:13-53:5)\n \n Anyone want to check on the Middle East Peace Process? emoticon_xhoho\n \n 16) The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance (Zechariah 8:23)\n \n No commentary needed\n \n 17) The ruined cities of Israel will be restored (Ezekiel 16:55) \n \n Sure, why not? But this also could make a great many of historical people the Jewish Messiah. Like Balfour. Seriously. \n \n 18) Weapons of war will be destroyed (Ezekiel 39:90\n \n No commentary needed\n \n 19) The Temple will be rebuilt resuming many of the suspended mitzvot. \n \n I don't see no temple! Fail\n \n 20) Jews will know the Torah without study\n \n Unless my jewish friend is lying to me, that hasn't happened\n \n 21) He will give you all the worthy desires of your heart \n \n ### does that mean and how does one measure it? \n \n 22) He will take the barren land and make it abundant and fruitful (Isaiah 51:3\n \n Sure, why not? But this also could make a great many of historical people the Jewish Messiah. Like Balfour. Seriously. \n \n So that's four with one questionable. That's 18%. Less than my earlier estimate. \n \n Your big mouth gets you into a world of trouble.",

Or are you afraid that if you are too specific you will embarrass yourself by revealing how ignorant you are regarding the messianic prophecies which Jesus represents?\n\n \n Ask and you shall receive. Links throughout for further enlightenment if you so choose to look. All from reputable sources. \n \n You place a lot of faith that men from a long time ago, some of good intentions and some not so good, guessed correctly what God's words for humanity were. The originals are long gone, we know as fact changes to scripture occurred often, some accidental, some intentional, of which some were for honest reason, but some not so honorable. \n \n Questioning the honesty of 1st thru 16th century man is not the same as questioning the the authority or validity of God.\n \n \n \n Question\n \n Why did the majority of the Jewish world reject Jesus as the Messiah, and why did the first Christians accept Jesus as the Messiah? \n \n Answer\n \n \n It is important to understand why Jews don't believe in Jesus. The purpose is not to disparage other religions, but rather to clarify the Jewish position. The more data that's available, the better-informed choices people can make about their spiritual path.\n \n Jews do not accept Jesus as the messiah because:\n \n 1) Jesus did not fulfill the messianic prophecies.\n 2) Jesus did not embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah.\n 3) Biblical verses \"referring\" to Jesus are mistranslations.\n 4) Jewish belief is based on national revelation.\n \n At the end of this article, we will examine these additional topics:\n \n 5) Christianity contradicts Jewish theology\n 6) Jews and Gentiles\n 7) Bringing the Messiah\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n 1) JESUS DID NOT FULFILL THE MESSIANIC PROPHECIES\n \n What is the Messiah supposed to accomplish? The Bible says that he will:\n A. Build the Third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28).\n B. Gather all Jews back to the Land of Israel (Isaiah 43:5-6).\n C. Usher in an era of world peace, and end all hatred, oppression, suffering and disease. As it says: \"Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall man learn war anymore.\" (Isaiah 2:4)\n D. Spread universal knowledge of the God of Israel, which will unite humanity as one. As it says: \"God will be King over all the world -- on that day, God will be One and His Name will be One\" (Zechariah 14:9).\n \n The historical fact is that Jesus fulfilled none of these messianic prophecies.\n \n Christians counter that Jesus will fulfill these in the Second Coming, but Jewish sources show that the Messiah will fulfill the prophecies outright, and no concept of a second coming exists.\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n 2) JESUS DID NOT EMBODY THE PERSONAL QUALIFICATIONS OF MESSIAH\n \n A. MESSIAH AS PROPHET\n \n Jesus was not a prophet. Prophecy can only exist in Israel when the land is inhabited by a majority of world Jewry. During the time of Ezra (circa 300 BCE), when the majority of Jews refused to move from Babylon to Israel, prophecy ended upon the death of the last prophets -- Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi.\n Jesus appeared on the scene approximately 350 years after prophecy had ended.\n \n B. DESCENDENT OF DAVID\n \n The Messiah must be descended on his father's side from King David (see Genesis 49:10 and Isaiah 11:1). According to the Christian claim that Jesus was the product of a virgin birth, he had no father -- and thus could not have possibly fulfilled the messianic requirement of being descended on his father's side from King David!\n \n C. TORAH OBSERVANCE\n \n The Messiah will lead the Jewish people to full Torah observance. The Torah states that all mitzvot remain binding forever, and anyone coming to change the Torah is immediately identified as a false prophet. (Deut. 13:1-4)\n Throughout the New Testament, Jesus contradicts the Torah and states that its commandments are no longer applicable. (see John 1:45 and 9:16, Acts 3:22 and 7:37)\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n 3) MISTRANSLATED VERSES \"REFERRING\" TO JESUS\n \n Biblical verses can only be understood by studying the original Hebrew text -- which reveals many discrepancies in the Christian translation.\n \n A. VIRGIN BIRTH\n \n The Christian idea of a virgin birth is derived from the verse in Isaiah 7:14 describing an \"alma\" as giving birth. The word \"alma\" has always meant a young woman, but Christian theologians came centuries later and translated it as \"virgin.\" This accords Jesus' birth with the first century pagan idea of mortals being impregnated by gods.\n \n B. CRUCIFIXION\n \n The verse in Psalms 22:17 reads: \"Like a lion, they are at my hands and feet.\" The Hebrew word ki-ari (like a lion) is grammatically similar to the word \"gouged.\" Thus Christianity reads the verse as a reference to crucifixion: \"They pierced my hands and feet.\"\n \n C. SUFFERING SERVANT\n \n Christianity claims that Isaiah chapter 53 refers to Jesus, as the \"suffering servant.\"\n In actuality, Isaiah 53 directly follows the theme of chapter 52, describing the exile and redemption of the Jewish people. The prophecies are written in the singular form because the Jews (\"Israel\") are regarded as one unit. The Torah is filled with examples of the Jewish nation referred to with a singular pronoun.\n Ironically, Isaiah's prophecies of persecution refer in part to the 11th century when Jews were tortured and killed by Crusaders who acted in the name of Jesus.\n From where did these mistranslations stem? St. Gregory, 4th century Bishop of Nanianzus, wrote: \"A little jargon is all that is necessary to impose on the people. The less they comprehend, the more they admire.\"\n \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n 4) JEWISH BELIEF IS BASED SOLELY ON NATIONAL REVELATION\n \n Of the 15,000 religions in human history, only Judaism bases its belief on national revelation -- i.e. God speaking to the entire nation. If God is going to start a religion, it makes sense He'll tell everyone, not just one person.\n Judaism, unique among all of the world's major religions, does not rely on \"claims of miracles\" as the basis for its religion. In fact, the Bible says that God sometimes grants the power of \"miracles\" to charlatans, in order to test Jewish loyalty to the Torah (Deut. 13:4).\n Maimonides states (Foundations of Torah, ch. 8):\n The Jews did not believe in Moses, our teacher, because of the miracles he performed. Whenever anyone's belief is based on seeing miracles, he has lingering doubts, because it is possible the miracles were performed through magic or sorcery. All of the miracles performed by Moses in the desert were because they were necessary, and not as proof of his prophecy.\n What then was the basis of [Jewish] belief? The Revelation at Mount Sinai, which we saw with our own eyes and heard with our own ears, not dependent on the testimony of others... as it says, \"Face to face, God spoke with you...\" The Torah also states: \"God did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us -- who are all here alive today.\" (Deut. 5:3)\n Judaism is not miracles. It is the personal eyewitness experience of every man, woman and child, standing at Mount Sinai 3,300 years ago.\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----\n \n 5) CHRISTIANITY CONTRADICTS JEWISH THEOLOGY\n \n The following theological points apply primarily to the Roman Catholic Church, the largest Christian denomination, and the one most familiar to the Western world.\n \n A. GOD AS THREE?\n \n The Catholic idea of Trinity breaks God into three separate beings: The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19).\n Contrast this to the Shema, the basis of Jewish belief: \"Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is ONE\" (Deut. 6:4). Jews declare the Shema every day, while writing it on doorposts (Mezuzah), and binding it to the hand and head (Tefillin). This statement of God's One-ness is the first words a Jewish child is taught to say, and the last words uttered before a Jew dies.\n In Jewish law, worship of a three-part god is considered idolatry -- one of the three cardinal sins that a Jew should rather give up his life than transgress. This explains why during the Inquisitions and throughout history, Jews gave up their lives rather than convert.\n \n B. MAN AS GOD?\n \n Christians believe that God came down to earth in human form, as Jesus said: \"I and the Father are one\" (John 10:30).\n Maimonides devotes most of the \"Guide for the Perplexed\" to the fundamental idea that God is incorporeal, meaning that He assumes no physical form. God is Eternal, above time. He is Infinite, beyond space. He cannot be born, and cannot die. Saying that God assumes human form makes God small, diminishing both His unity and His divinity. As the Torah says: \"God is not a mortal\" (Numbers 23:19).\n Judaism says that the Messiah will be born of human parents, and possess normal physical attributes like other people. He will not be a demi-god, and will not possess supernatural qualities. In fact, an individual is alive in every generation with the capacity to step into the role of the Messiah. (see Maimonides - Laws of Kings 11:3)\n \n C. INTERMEDIARY FOR PRAYER?\n \n The Catholic belief is that prayer must be directed through an intermediary -- i.e. confessing one's sins to a priest. Jesus himself is an intermediary, as Jesus said: \"No man cometh unto the Father but by me.\"\n In Judaism, prayer is a totally private matter, between each individual and God. As the Bible says: \"God is near to all who call unto Him\" (Psalms 145:18). Further, the Ten Commandments state: \"You shall have no other gods BEFORE ME,\" meaning that it is forbidden to set up a mediator between God and man. (see Maimonides - Laws of Idolatry ch. 1)\n \n D. INVOLVEMENT IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD\n \n Catholic doctrine often treats the physical world as an evil to be avoided. Mary, the holiest woman, is portrayed as a virgin. Priests and nuns are celibate. And monasteries are in remote, secluded locations.\n By contrast, Judaism believes that God created the physical world not to frustrate us, but for our pleasure. Jewish spirituality comes through grappling with the mundane world in a way that uplifts and elevates. Sex in the proper context is one of the holiest acts we can perform.\n The Talmud says if a person has the opportunity to taste a new fruit and refuses to do so, he will have to account for that in the World to Come. Jewish rabbinical schools teach how to live amidst the bustle of commercial activity. Jews don't retreat from life, we elevate it.\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n 6) JEWS AND GENTILES\n \n Judaism does not demand that everyone convert to the religion. The Torah of Moses is a truth for all humanity, whether Jewish or not. King Solomon asked God to heed the prayers of non-Jews who come to the Holy Temple (Kings I 8:41-43). The prophet Isaiah refers to the Temple as a \"House for all nations.\"\n The Temple service during Sukkot featured 70 bull offerings, corresponding to the 70 nations of the world. The Talmud says that if the Romans would have realized how much benefit they were getting from the Temple, they'd never have destroyed it.\n Jews have never actively sought converts to Judaism because the Torah prescribes a righteous path for gentiles to follow, known as the \"Seven Laws of Noah.\" Maimonides explains that any human being who faithfully observes these basic moral laws earns a proper place in heaven.\n \n For further study of the Seven Laws of Noah, see:\n \n Bnei Noah of Fort Worth\n www.fastlane.net [5]\n \n Path of the Righteous Gentile\n Noahide Laws, The Seven - Jewish Knowledge Base\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----\n \n 7) BRINGING THE MESSIAH\n \n Maimonides states that the popularity of Christianity (and Islam) is part of God's plan to spread the ideals of Torah throughout the world. This moves society closer to a perfected state of morality and toward a greater understanding of God. All this is in preparation for the Messianic age.\n Indeed, the world is in desperate need of Messianic redemption. War and pollution threaten our planet; ego and confusion erode family life. To the extent we are aware of the problems of society, is the extent we will yearn for redemption. As the Talmud says, one of the first questions a Jew is asked on Judgment Day is: \"Did you yearn for the arrival of the Messiah?\"\n How can we hasten the coming of the Messiah? The best way is to love all humanity generously, to keep the mitzvot of the Torah (as best we can), and to encourage others to do so as well.\n \n Despite the gloom, the world does seem headed toward redemption. One apparent sign is that the Jewish people have returned to the Land of Israel and made it bloom again. Additionally, a major movement is afoot of young Jews returning to Torah tradition.\n \n The Messiah can come at any moment, and it all depends on our actions. God is ready when we are. For as King David says: \"Redemption will come today -- if you hearken to His voice.\"\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n For further study, read \"The Real Messiah\" by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan\n \n Online resources on the Jewish view of Jesus:\n Jews for Judaism\n Outreach Judaism - responds directly to the issues raised by missionaries and cults.

   "Let's see how badly Archangel Fails:\n \n Your big mouth gets you into a world of trouble.\n\n \n Why is it that you always pull a daewoo and boast and bluster and claim victory in advance as you make this about a personal attack by saying that Archangel \"FAILS\" when you never actually answer the question posed or prove anything at all? It is you who fails to comprehend what you are discussing at even the most basic level, spiritually speaking. Here in quotes is my original question.\n \n \nIs posting a complete link without specifying what prophecies he has and hasn't fulfilled \"YET\", and you consider this a rational, logical rebuttal to my post? \n\n \n You see the bolded \"YET\" little child, the only thing you bring to this forum beside your denials of the truth in Gods word of course, is your incomparable ignorance of anything spiritual. You must attempt to impugn my intelligence by attempting to show that I fail somehow rather than just showing with real and true understanding, which you sorely lack, how the bible itself is wrong. You can't show this because it isn't wrong at all.\n \n You fail to understand that the bible very clearly describes and prophecies about 2 returning Kings/Messiah's. This is why so many Jews rejected Jesus, because He wasn't the conquering king they were seeking at the time of his coming. But hey, since you're a scoffer and a mocker who hates the truth and will never take my word for any of this, here's a link that will explain the two Messiah's: The Returning King: The \"Two Messiahs\" in Zechariah - http://www.jewsforjesus.org/publications/issues/15_5/returningking/ with an excerpt. Hopefully this will educate you to understand that not all prophecies have been fulfilled yet.\n The Returning King: The \"Two Messiahs\" in Zechariah\n \n Zechariah 9:9-10 -- A King of Peace\n \n Israel certainly had her share of disappointing kings. The books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles attest to this history. But in Zechariah 9:9-10, the prophet points to a coming king who is unique.\n \"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!\n Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem!\n Behold, your king is coming to you;\n He is just and endowed with salvation,\n Humble, and mounted on a donkey,\n Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\n And He will speak peace to the nations;\n And His dominion will be from sea to sea,\n And from the River to the ends of the earth.\"\n This isn't just any king. The prophet tells the people of Israel to be joyful, to get excited, because the promised one, the one sent from God, the long awaited king, is coming. And so this passage has been interpreted as messianic; that is, it is often supposed that the king in this passage is none other than the Messiah, the savior of Israel.\n \n Traditional Judaism teaches that, \"The messiah is a G-d fearing, pious Jew, who is both a Torah scholar and a great leader. He is to be a direct descendent of King David, anointed as the new Jewish King. (In fact, the Hebrew word for messiah 'Moshiach' means 'anointed one.')\"1\n \n Many Jewish people do not give much thought to the coming of a Messiah anymore, and those who do often picture him as a mighty conqueror, even a superhero-type figure. But here in Zechariah 9 the picture is very different the king is not coming to fight a war; he comes in gentleness and meekness. He is the king over all the earth and he has all authority, but he comes in this humble fashion, riding on a baby donkey, as opposed to a chariot or even a great horse.\n \n This passage of Scripture provides a picture of a Messiah-king, a deliverer of salvation, gently offering his kingship to Israel and to the world he is a man of peace for all peoples. He will proclaim peace to all the nations, not just to Israel.\n \n In our world today peaceful people may win prizes, but they don't necessarily command authority. We've come to expect a certain amount of confidence, even arrogance, from our leaders. We expect them to do what they have to do to maintain order. Especially in Israel and the Middle East, it is difficult to fathom that someone could come to such power on peaceful terms. A king who does not fight? Yet in this passage, that is exactly what is promised.\n \n Zechariah 14:2-4 -- A King of War\n \n Later, however, Zechariah gives another description of the coming king, a picture quite different from that of chapter 9. Let's take a brief look at the context for his statement:\n \"For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured. Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.\"\n This picture is very much like an epic battle scene from a movie full of bloodshed and tragedy and triumph. Then in verses 8-9 we read:\n \"And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the Lord will be king over all the earth; in that day the Lord will be the only one, and His name the only one.\"\n Chapters 9 and 14 are the central passages in Zechariah telling of this king who will reign over all the earth. In chapter 9 the king is humble, but in chapter 14 he is a force to be reckoned with. In the latter picture, the king is a conqueror; he comes in wrath, meting out judgment to the enemies of Israel. This is perhaps a more traditional picture of Messiah, a mighty hero who fights on our behalf.\n \n Mysteriously, this passage seems to suggest that this Messiah-king is none other than the Lord God himself, God coming to fight on behalf of his people (see page 8). In any case, we are presented with a dramatically different picture of the king here than the one we see in Zechariah 9.\n \n Two Descriptions, Two Kings?\n \n So the question is, does this king who reigns over all the earth come gently, riding on a donkey in peace? Or in great wrath, ready to do battle? Is Zechariah contradicting himself? This is a big puzzle for Jewish scholars as well. But this is not the only place in the Scriptures where we find seemingly divergent pictures of Messiah (see chart on page 5). For example, Micah 5 tells us he is born in Bethlehem, the city of David. But in Daniel 7 the prophet tells us he will arrive, riding on the clouds of heaven. Is the Messiah going to be cut off (killed) as predicted in Daniel 9, or will he come in regal splendor and reign forever, as Isaiah 9 tells us? Is he the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 or a royal king portrayed in Psalm 2?\n \n In response to these two seemingly opposite pictures of Messiah, some rabbis decided that there must be two messiahs, the Messiah ben Yosef who would come and suffer and Messiah ben David, who would come as a conquering king.\n \n Another Jewish tradition explains the two contrasting portraits of Messiah like this: \"If the people of Israel will be righteous, the Messiah will come in the clouds of Heaven. If they will not be righteous, he will come as a poor man riding upon an XXX\" (Sanhedrin 98a).\n \n Are such explanations necessary or is it possible that one individual might \"fit the bill\" of both pictures; someone who would be both a king of peace and a king of power, a humble servant and a conqueror? If so, what would this extraordinary person look like?\n \n The Once and Future King\n \n There is still another Jewish view concerning the two pictures of the Messiah-king that accurately fulfills the portrait we see in Zechariah and elsewhere in the Hebrew Scriptures. This view actually predates the other two mentioned. It's the position presented in the New Testament.\n \n The writers of the New Testament were Jewish people, living in the first century, who believed that the prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures described one Messiah, a great king who was to come twice, first as a servant, then as conqueror. They believed that Y'shua (Jesus) was the fulfillment of both expectations.\n \n Y'shua was not a typical king. His was a life marked by humility. He was a man of gentleness and peace. But the peace he offered was different from what most people think about it was a peace that comes from the depth of personal spiritual solutions that Y'shua offered to people who would follow him.\n So cmon back daewoo, er, I mean little child. (Sorry, it's just so easy to confuse you two based on your dishonest style of attacking and using intimidation while proving nothing at all.) And tell me how complete your understanding is of the bible and prophecy as you again claim I fail. Only in debating you and when relying on your complete ignorance do I seem to fail in these debates according to your irrational rants.\n \n PS. And pappillion001 this post is directed at you also. I see no reason to repeat myself since this answers your ignorance of the facts also. Thanks for playing though... :)",

You must attempt to impugn my intelligence by attempting to show that I fail somehow rather than just showing with real and true understanding, which you sorely lack, how the bible itself is wrong. You can't show this because it isn't wrong at all.\n \n You fail to understand that the bible very clearly describes and prophecies about 2 returning Kings/Messiah's. This is why so many Jews rejected Jesus, because He wasn't the conquering king they were seeking at the time of his coming. But hey, since you're a scoffer and a mocker who hates the truth and will never take my word for any of this, here's a link that will explain the two Messiah's: The Returning King: The \"Two Messiahs\" in Zechariah - http://www.jewsforjesus.org/publications/issues/15_5/returningking/ with an excerpt. Hopefully this will educate you to understand that not all prophecies have been fulfilled yet.\n The Returning King: The \"Two Messiahs\" in Zechariah\n \n Zechariah 9:9-10 -- A King of Peace\n \n Israel certainly had her share of disappointing kings. The books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles attest to this history. But in Zechariah 9:9-10, the prophet points to a coming king who is unique.\n \"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!\n Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem!\n Behold, your king is coming to you;\n He is just and endowed with salvation,\n Humble, and mounted on a donkey,\n Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\n And He will speak peace to the nations;\n And His dominion will be from sea to sea,\n And from the River to the ends of the earth.\"\n This isn't just any king. The prophet tells the people of Israel to be joyful, to get excited, because the promised one, the one sent from God, the long awaited king, is coming. And so this passage has been interpreted as messianic; that is, it is often supposed that the king in this passage is none other than the Messiah, the savior of Israel.\n \n Traditional Judaism teaches that, \"The messiah is a G-d fearing, pious Jew, who is both a Torah scholar and a great leader. He is to be a direct descendent of King David, anointed as the new Jewish King. (In fact, the Hebrew word for messiah 'Moshiach' means 'anointed one.')\"1\n \n Many Jewish people do not give much thought to the coming of a Messiah anymore, and those who do often picture him as a mighty conqueror, even a superhero-type figure. But here in Zechariah 9 the picture is very different the king is not coming to fight a war; he comes in gentleness and meekness. He is the king over all the earth and he has all authority, but he comes in this humble fashion, riding on a baby donkey, as opposed to a chariot or even a great horse.\n \n This passage of Scripture provides a picture of a Messiah-king, a deliverer of salvation, gently offering his kingship to Israel and to the world he is a man of peace for all peoples. He will proclaim peace to all the nations, not just to Israel.\n \n In our world today peaceful people may win prizes, but they don't necessarily command authority. We've come to expect a certain amount of confidence, even arrogance, from our leaders. We expect them to do what they have to do to maintain order. Especially in Israel and the Middle East, it is difficult to fathom that someone could come to such power on peaceful terms. A king who does not fight? Yet in this passage, that is exactly what is promised.\n \n Zechariah 14:2-4 -- A King of War\n \n Later, however, Zechariah gives another description of the coming king, a picture quite different from that of chapter 9. Let's take a brief look at the context for his statement:\n \"For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured. Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.\"\n This picture is very much like an epic battle scene from a movie full of bloodshed and tragedy and triumph. Then in verses 8-9 we read:\n \"And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the Lord will be king over all the earth; in that day the Lord will be the only one, and His name the only one.\"\n Chapters 9 and 14 are the central passages in Zechariah telling of this king who will reign over all the earth. In chapter 9 the king is humble, but in chapter 14 he is a force to be reckoned with. In the latter picture, the king is a conqueror; he comes in wrath, meting out judgment to the enemies of Israel. This is perhaps a more traditional picture of Messiah, a mighty hero who fights on our behalf.\n \n Mysteriously, this passage seems to suggest that this Messiah-king is none other than the Lord God himself, God coming to fight on behalf of his people (see page 8). In any case, we are presented with a dramatically different picture of the king here than the one we see in Zechariah 9.\n \n Two Descriptions, Two Kings?\n \n So the question is, does this king who reigns over all the earth come gently, riding on a donkey in peace? Or in great wrath, ready to do battle? Is Zechariah contradicting himself? This is a big puzzle for Jewish scholars as well. But this is not the only place in the Scriptures where we find seemingly divergent pictures of Messiah (see chart on page 5). For example, Micah 5 tells us he is born in Bethlehem, the city of David. But in Daniel 7 the prophet tells us he will arrive, riding on the clouds of heaven. Is the Messiah going to be cut off (killed) as predicted in Daniel 9, or will he come in regal splendor and reign forever, as Isaiah 9 tells us? Is he the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 or a royal king portrayed in Psalm 2?\n \n In response to these two seemingly opposite pictures of Messiah, some rabbis decided that there must be two messiahs, the Messiah ben Yosef who would come and suffer and Messiah ben David, who would come as a conquering king.\n \n Another Jewish tradition explains the two contrasting portraits of Messiah like this: \"If the people of Israel will be righteous, the Messiah will come in the clouds of Heaven. If they will not be righteous, he will come as a poor man riding upon an XXX\" (Sanhedrin 98a).\n \n Are such explanations necessary or is it possible that one individual might \"fit the bill\" of both pictures; someone who would be both a king of peace and a king of power, a humble servant and a conqueror? If so, what would this extraordinary person look like?\n \n The Once and Future King\n \n There is still another Jewish view concerning the two pictures of the Messiah-king that accurately fulfills the portrait we see in Zechariah and elsewhere in the Hebrew Scriptures. This view actually predates the other two mentioned. It's the position presented in the New Testament.\n \n The writers of the New Testament were Jewish people, living in the first century, who believed that the prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures described one Messiah, a great king who was to come twice, first as a servant, then as conqueror.

How can you sit there and be so confident that the Jews have it all wrong. Especially considering Christians have on a number of occasions altered texts. One of the criteria for texts to be considered for and included in of the Christian Canon was that it had to uphold then current doctrine.\n \n Even if for the sake of argument I say ok 2 messiahs or same one on two different occassions. If you would bother to read what I posted you would see \n \n A) Mine is coming from a Jewish source. Yours from Jews for Jesus, which sorry to break this to you, but they aren't really Jewish. I don't see how they could have anything but a Christian slant on the issue since it would make for a rather akward scenerio if as beleiver in Jesus they belived in scripture that disqualified him as the Messaiah.\n \n B) There are a number of reasons given in my previous post that disqualify Jesus as being one or the 1st incarnation but here are some more\n \n The Jewish Concept of Messiah and the Jewish Response to Christian Claims \n \n \n 1) The word &#8220;Messiah&#8221; is an English rendering of the Hebrew word &#8220;Mashiach&#8221;, whose translation is &#8220;Anointed&#8221;. It usually refers to a person initiated into G-d&#8217;s service by being anointed with oil. (Having oil poured on his head. Cf. Exodus 29:7, I Kings 1:39, II Kings 9:3). \n \n \n 2) There are many Messiahs in the Bible. Since every King and High Priest was anointed with oil, each may be referred to as &#8220;an anointed one&#8221; (a Mashiach or a Messiah). For example: &#8220;G-d forbid that I [David] should stretch out my hand against the L-rd&#8217;s Messiah [Saul]...&#8221; I Samuel 26:11. Cf. II Samuel 23:1, Isaiah 45:1, Psalms 20:6. \n \n \n 3) The Hebrew word &#8220;HaMashiach&#8221; (lit. the Messiah) describing a future anointed person to come does not appear anywhere in the Bible. Since the Bible makes no explicit reference to the Messiah, it is unlikely that it could be considered the most important concept in the Bible. Indeed, in Jewish thought, the Messianic idea is not the most crucial. However, in Christian thought, the Messiah is paramount- a difficulty in light of its conspicuous absence from scripture. \n \n \n 4) Where does the Jewish concept of Messiah come from? One of the central themes of Biblical prophecy is the promise of a future age of perfection characterized by universal peace and recognition of G-d. Isaiah 2:1-4; Zephaniah 3:9; Hosea 2:20-22; Amos 9:13-15; Isaiah 32:15-18, 60:15-18; Micah 4:1-4; Zechariah 8:23, 14:9; Jeremiah 31:33-34. \n \n \n 5) Many of these prophetic passages speak of a descendant of King David who will rule Israel during the age of perfection. Isaiah 11:1-9; Jeremiah 23:5-6, 30:7-10, 33:14-16; Ezekiel 34:11-31, 37:21-28; Hosea 3:4-5. \n \n \n 6) Since every King is a Messiah, by convention, we refer to this future anointed one as The Messiah. The above is the only description in the Bible of a Davidic descendant who is to come in the future. We will recognize the Messiah by seeing who the King of Israel is at the time of complete universal perfection. \n \n \n 7) The Bible never speaks about believing in the Messiah. Because his reign will be an historically verifiable reality, self-evident to any person, it won&#8217;t require belief or faith. \n \n \n 8) Because no person has ever fulfilled the picture painted in the Bible of this future King, Jewish people still await the coming of the Messiah. All past Messianic claimants, including Jesus of Nazareth, Bar Cochba and Shabbtai Tzvi have been rejected. \n \n \n 9) The claim that Jesus will fulfill the Messianic prophesies when he returns does not give him any credibility for his &#8220;first&#8221; coming. The Bible never speaks about the Messiah returning after an initial appearance. The &#8220;second coming&#8221; theory is a desperate attempt to explain away Jesus&#8217; failure. The Biblical passages which Christians are forced to regard as second coming (#5 above) don&#8217;t speak of someone returning, they have a &#8220;first coming&#8221; perspective. \n \n \n 10) According to Biblical tradition, Elijah the prophet will reappear before the coming of the Messiah (Malachi 4:5-6). In the Greek Testament, Jesus claims that John the Baptist was Elijah (Matthew 11:13-14, 17:10-13). However, when John the Baptist was asked if he was Elijah, he denied it (John 1:21). The Gospel of Luke 1:17 tries to get around this problem by claiming that John the Baptist came in the spirit of Elijah. However: \n \n a] Malachi predicted that Elijah himself would return, and not just someone coming in his spirit.\n \n b] When asked about his identity, John the Baptist didn&#8217;t claim to have come in the spirit of Elijah - he claimed no association with Elijah at all.\n \n c] The prophesy about the return of Elijah says that he would restore the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. There is no evidence that John the Baptist accomplished this. \n \n \n 11) According to the Jewish Bible, the Messiah must be a descendent of King David. (Jeremiah 23:5, 33:17; Ezekiel 34:23-24) Although the Greek Testament traces the genealogy of Joseph (husband of Mary) back to David, it then claims that Jesus resulted from a virgin birth, and, that Joseph was not his father. (Mat. 1:18-23) In response, it is claimed that Joseph adopted Jesus, and passed on his genealogy via adoption. \n \n \n There are two problems with this claim: \n \n a) there is no Biblical basis for the idea of a father passing on his tribal line by adoption. A priest who adopts a son from another tribe cannot make him a priest by adoption;\n \n b) Joseph could never pass on by adoption that which he doesn&#8217;t have. Because Joseph descended from Jeconiah (Mat. 1:11) he fell under the curse of that king that none of his descendants could ever sit as king upon the throne of David. (Jeremiah 22:30; 36:30). \n \n \n To answer this difficult problem, apologists claim that Jesus traces himself back to King David through his mother Mary, who allegedly descends from David, as shown in the third chapter of Luke. There are four basic problems with this claim: \n \n a] There is no evidence that Mary descends from David. The third chapter of Luke traces Joseph&#8217;s genealogy, not Mary&#8217;s.\n \n b] Even if Mary can trace herself back to David, that doesn&#8217;t help Jesus, since tribal affiliation goes only through the father, not mother. Cf. Num. 1:18; Ezra 2:59.\n \n c] Even if family line could go through the mother, Mary was not from a legitimate Messianic family. According to the Bible, the Messiah must be a descendent of David through his son Solomon (II Sam. 7:14; \n \n I Chron. 17:11-14, 22:9-10, 28:4-6) The third chapter of Luke is useless because it goes through David&#8217;s son Nathan, not Solomon. (Luke 3:31)\n \n d] Luke 3:27 lists Shealtiel and Zerubbabel in his genealogy. These two also appear in Matthew 1:12 as descendants of the cursed Jeconiah. If Mary descends from them, it would also disqualify her from being a Messianic progenitor. \n \n \n What I find hard to beleive is how you can actually sit there and think that Christians understand Jewish scripture better than Jews. That Christian interpretation is accurate and the Jews are the ones who have copied it down wrong. You won't even bother to look at how the Christian bible came to be and the history of the people who caused it to be. You want to say anybody who doesn't beleive like you is ignorant or spritually bankrupt. Good thing for us you didn't live 300 years ago then you could just burn us as heretics and go one living your fantasy. You must be so blissfull, wrong but your ignorance protects you from unwanted truth. If you want to play your going to have to try much harder or you will continue to get spanked all up and down this forum. bah bye now come back when you think you can play in the big sand box\n \n ==========================================================================================================\n \n \n \n Why is it that you always pull a daewoo and boast and bluster and claim victory in advance as you make this about a personal attack by saying that Archangel \"FAILS\" when you never actually answer the question posed or prove anything at all? It is you who fails to comprehend what you are discussing at even the most basic level, spiritually speaking. Here in quotes is my original question.\n \n \n \n You see the bolded \"YET\" little child, the only thing you bring to this forum beside your denials of the truth in Gods word of course, is your incomparable ignorance of anything spiritual. You must attempt to impugn my intelligence by attempting to show that I fail somehow rather than just showing with real and true understanding, which you sorely lack, how the bible itself is wrong. You can't show this because it isn't wrong at all.\n \n You fail to understand that the bible very clearly describes and prophecies about 2 returning Kings/Messiah's. This is why so many Jews rejected Jesus, because He wasn't the conquering king they were seeking at the time of his coming. But hey, since you're a scoffer and a mocker who hates the truth and will never take my word for any of this, here's a link that will explain the two Messiah's: The Returning King: The \"Two Messiahs\" in Zechariah - http://www.jewsforjesus.org/publications/issues/15_5/returningking/ with an excerpt. Hopefully this will educate you to understand that not all prophecies have been fulfilled yet.\n The Returning King: The \"Two Messiahs\" in Zechariah\n \n Zechariah 9:9-10 -- A King of Peace\n \n Israel certainly had her share of disappointing kings. The books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles attest to this history. But in Zechariah 9:9-10, the prophet points to a coming king who is unique.\n \"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!\n Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem!\n Behold, your king is coming to you;\n He is just and endowed with salvation,\n Humble, and mounted on a donkey,\n Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\n And He will speak peace to the nations;\n And His dominion will be from sea to sea,\n And from the River to the ends of the earth.\"\n This isn't just any king. The prophet tells the people of Israel to be joyful, to get excited, because the promised one, the one sent from God, the long awaited king, is coming. And so this passage has been interpreted as messianic; that is, it is often supposed that the king in this passage is none other than the Messiah, the savior of Israel.\n \n Traditional Judaism teaches that, \"The messiah is a G-d fearing, pious Jew, who is both a Torah scholar and a great leader. He is to be a direct descendent of King David, anointed as the new Jewish King. (In fact, the Hebrew word for messiah 'Moshiach' means 'anointed one.')\"1\n \n Many Jewish people do not give much thought to the coming of a Messiah anymore, and those who do often picture him as a mighty conqueror, even a superhero-type figure. But here in Zechariah 9 the picture is very different the king is not coming to fight a war; he comes in gentleness and meekness. He is the king over all the earth and he has all authority, but he comes in this humble fashion, riding on a baby donkey, as opposed to a chariot or even a great horse.\n \n This passage of Scripture provides a picture of a Messiah-king, a deliverer of salvation, gently offering his kingship to Israel and to the world he is a man of peace for all peoples. He will proclaim peace to all the nations, not just to Israel.\n \n In our world today peaceful people may win prizes, but they don't necessarily command authority. We've come to expect a certain amount of confidence, even arrogance, from our leaders. We expect them to do what they have to do to maintain order. Especially in Israel and the Middle East, it is difficult to fathom that someone could come to such power on peaceful terms. A king who does not fight? Yet in this passage, that is exactly what is promised.\n \n Zechariah 14:2-4 -- A King of War\n \n Later, however, Zechariah gives another description of the coming king, a picture quite different from that of chapter 9. Let's take a brief look at the context for his statement:\n \"For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured. Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.\"\n This picture is very much like an epic battle scene from a movie full of bloodshed and tragedy and triumph. Then in verses 8-9 we read:\n \"And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the Lord will be king over all the earth; in that day the Lord will be the only one, and His name the only one.\"\n Chapters 9 and 14 are the central passages in Zechariah telling of this king who will reign over all the earth. In chapter 9 the king is humble, but in chapter 14 he is a force to be reckoned with. In the latter picture, the king is a conqueror; he comes in wrath, meting out judgment to the enemies of Israel. This is perhaps a more traditional picture of Messiah, a mighty hero who fights on our behalf.\n \n Mysteriously, this passage seems to suggest that this Messiah-king is none other than the Lord God himself, God coming to fight on behalf of his people (see page 8). In any case, we are presented with a dramatically different picture of the king here than the one we see in Zechariah 9.\n \n Two Descriptions, Two Kings?\n \n So the question is, does this king who reigns over all the earth come gently, riding on a donkey in peace? Or in great wrath, ready to do battle? Is Zechariah contradicting himself? This is a big puzzle for Jewish scholars as well. But this is not the only place in the Scriptures where we find seemingly divergent pictures of Messiah (see chart on page 5). For example, Micah 5 tells us he is born in Bethlehem, the city of David. But in Daniel 7 the prophet tells us he will arrive, riding on the clouds of heaven. Is the Messiah going to be cut off (killed) as predicted in Daniel 9, or will he come in regal splendor and reign forever, as Isaiah 9 tells us? Is he the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 or a royal king portrayed in Psalm 2?\n \n In response to these two seemingly opposite pictures of Messiah, some rabbis decided that there must be two messiahs, the Messiah ben Yosef who would come and suffer and Messiah ben David, who would come as a conquering king.\n \n Another Jewish tradition explains the two contrasting portraits of Messiah like this: \"If the people of Israel will be righteous, the Messiah will come in the clouds of Heaven. If they will not be righteous, he will come as a poor man riding upon an XXX\" (Sanhedrin 98a).\n \n Are such explanations necessary or is it possible that one individual might \"fit the bill\" of both pictures; someone who would be both a king of peace and a king of power, a humble servant and a conqueror? If so, what would this extraordinary person look like?\n \n The Once and Future King\n \n There is still another Jewish view concerning the two pictures of the Messiah-king that accurately fulfills the portrait we see in Zechariah and elsewhere in the Hebrew Scriptures. This view actually predates the other two mentioned. It's the position presented in the New Testament.\n \n The writers of the New Testament were Jewish people, living in the first century, who believed that the prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures described one Messiah, a great king who was to come twice, first as a servant, then as conqueror. They believed that Y'shua (Jesus) was the fulfillment of both expectations.\n \n Y'shua was not a typical king. His was a life marked by humility. He was a man of gentleness and peace. But the peace he offered was different from what most people think about it was a peace that comes from the depth of personal spiritual solutions that Y'shua offered to people who would follow him.\n So cmon back daewoo, er, I mean little child. (Sorry, it's just so easy to confuse you two based on your dishonest style of attacking and using intimidation while proving nothing at all.) And tell me how complete your understanding is of the bible and prophecy as you again claim I fail. Only in debating you and when relying on your complete ignorance do I seem to fail in these debates according to your irrational rants.\n \n PS. And pappillion001 this post is directed at you also. I see no reason to repeat myself since this answers your ignorance of the facts also. Thanks for playing though... :)[/QUOTE]",

   " Because Joseph descended from Jeconiah (Mat. 1:11) he fell under the curse of that king that none of his descendants could ever sit as king upon the throne of David. (Jeremiah 22:30; 36:30). \n\n \n There's all kinds of problems with your examples and your depiction of the Messiah, the genealogy of Jesus, etc. Your example above is not even universally shared by other Jews. For instance:\n \n \"We find rabbinic sources which also agree that God reversed the curse on Jeconiah, which they attribute to repentance on Jeconiah's part. We even find the idea that the Messiah will descend from Jeconiah--exactly the opposite of what some say is impossible! Some of these sources are as follows:\" \n \n Jewish Encyclopedia \n \n Jehoiachin's sad experiences changed his nature entirely, and as he repented of the sins which he had committed as king he was pardoned by God, who revoked the decree to the effect that none of his descendants should ever become king (Jer. xxii.30; Pesik., ed. Buber, xxv. 163a, b): he even became the ancestor of the Messiah (Tan., Toledot, 20 [ed. Buber, i. 140]). --Louis Ginzberg, \"Jehoiachin,\" vol. 7 p. 84. \n \n Rabbi A. J. Rosenberg on Jeremiah 22:24 (20th c.) \n \n Malbim calls to our attention that in the prophecy of Haggai (2:23), God says, \"On that day I will take you, Zerubbabel, and I will make you like a signet,\" for the King Messiah will be like a signet ring on God's right hand, so to speak. Just as the name of the owner of the ring is engraved on his signet ring, through which he makes himself known, so will God's name be known in the world through the King Messiah, through whom His miracles will be known. He says here that, though, in the future, Coniah will be the signet on My right hand, for the Messiah will spring from his seed, now I will remove him from there. --Ibid., p. 183. Malbim is an acronym for Meir Loeb ben Jehiel Michale, a 19th c. rabbi and commentator. 22:24. \n \n Encyclopedia Judaica \n \n Even the decree that none of his descendants would ascend the throne (Jer. 22:30) was repealed when Zerubbabel was appointed leader of the returned exiles (cf. Sanh. 37b-38a). --\"Jehoiachin\" (9:1319). \n \n Rabbi A. J. Rosenberg, on Jeremiah 22:30 (20th c.) \n \n In this, too, no man of his seed shall prosper, namely that no one will occupy the throne of David nor rule in Judah. Although we find that Zerubbabel, his great grandson, did rule over Judah upon the return of the exiles, the Rabbis (Pesikta d'Rav Kahana p. 163a) state that this was because Jehoiachin repented while in prison. They state further: Repentance is great, for it nullifies a person's sentence, as it is stated: 'Inscribe this man childless.' But since he repented, his sentence was revoked and turned to the good, and he said to him, \"I will take you, Zerubbabel, and I will make you a signet\" (Haggai 2:23). They state further: Said Rabbi Johanan: Exile expiates all sins, as it is said: \"Inscribe this man childless,\" and after he was exiled, it is written: '(1 Chron. 3:17) And the sons of Jeconiah, Assir, Shealtiel his son'--[Redak]. --A. J. Rosenberg, Jeremiah: A New English Translation (New York: Judaica Press, 1985), vol. 1 p. 185. \"Redak\" is an acronym for Rabbi David Kimchi (13th c.), whose opinion Rosenberg cites. The Problem of the Curse on Jeconiah in Relation to the Genealogy of Jesus - http://www.jewsforjesus.org/answers/prophecy/jeconiah/\n \n Second, it&#8217;s not a biological son of Jeconiah, or of Solomon who is going to be the Messiah, but God / the Son of God (Jeremiah 23:5-6, Isaiah 9:6-7, Psalm 2, etc.).  This is confirmed in Matthew, that that which was conceived in Mary is of the Holy Spirit (God &#8211; Matthew 28:19; Acts 5, etc.).\n \n You say: \"According to the Bible, the Messiah must be a descendent of David through his son Solomon (II Sam. 7:14;...)\" \n \n That's highly debatable also:\n \n Note carefully the language used about Solomon: &#8220;I will establish his kingdom&#8230;I will establish his throne forever&#8230;.I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever&#8221; (1 Chronicles 17). \n \n There was, however, a divine condition clearly laid out: &#8220;I will establish his kingdom forever IF he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws, as is being done at this time&#8221; (1 Chronicles 28:7). Was Solomon unswerving in carrying out God&#8217;s commands and laws? Hardly!  The scriptural record is very clear:\n \n From 1 Kings 11:1-8 - \n \n 1 King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughter&#8212;Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites. 2 They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, \"You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.\" Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love. 3 He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. 4 As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been. 5 He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech [a] the detestable god of the Ammonites. 6 So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not follow the LORD completely, as David his father had done. \n \n 7 On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites. 8 He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods. \n \n From 1 Kings 11:9-13\n \n 9 The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD's command. 11 So the LORD said to Solomon, \"Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates. 12 Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son. 13 Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.\" \n \n Solomon did not meet God&#8217;s conditions, and his throne was not established forever. It is the Throne of David&#8217;s which was to meet the condition. (Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus, Vol. 4, pages 90-91)",

   "Id have to agree with the Jews for Jesus material being junk. Not neccesarily because of its content (although I'd definately check it twice!), but because of their methods. Standing outside synagogues on the Day of Atonement eating ham and cheese sandwiches openly and defiantly in front of disgusted Jewish worshippers, in order to \"witness\" to them that the law of Moses is done away with is just reprehensible. The New Testament would have several issues with that. As far as I know they've stopped that. \n \n These 'witnesses to the Jews' wait at bus stops and subway terminals I've even seen them at airports for God's sake, just literally accosting anyone wearing a skullcap and arguing with them to the point of yelling. I've had several run ins with them and in my opinion, I consider them anti-missionary in themselves, by distorting the gospel so thoroughly through their methods that I find it hard to believe crack addicts could see the truth in them.\n \n Over the years I have seen them tone down a little, but their organization still rightly carries the stigma they earned. They'd do far better to disband and form another one and keep on making progress on how to witness to anyone in general and Jews in particular. \n \n So you'd prove your points better citing the actual Bible verse or Jewish material that supports your point and making your own argument on why it is valid and applicable, rather than citing, posting, or linking to J4J junk.",

Apollos used the scriptures to convince many Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. Acts 18:28 says, \"... he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.\" This was in about 53 AD, around 20 years after Christ's crucifixion. Since the vast majority of the portion of scripture commonly called the \"New Testament\" had not yet been written, it is apparent that when Acts 18:24 refers to \"the scriptures\", it is referring to the portion of scripture commonly called the \"Old Testament\".\n \n There are at least four reasons that provide evidence that the 39 books of the Old Testament date back to a time long before Jesus Christ's earthly ministry:\n \n 1. It was proven by the finding of the dead sea scrolls, which include the Old Testament writings and predate Christ's earthly ministry. \n 2. Even those of the Jew's religion, who do not believe Jesus Christ is the Messiah, agree that these 39 books were written prior to 300 BC. \n 3. The Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures, was initiated in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus (285-246 BC). Obviously, the Old Testament had to have already been written in order to have been translated. \n 4. Jesus Christ and the various New Testament writers frequently quoted from the books of the Old Testament.\n \n Some skeptics have tried to contend that there must have been some collaboration between the many writers of the Bible. However, there were many Old Testament prophets scattered over a 1000-year period who have given detailed descriptions regarding the same events which have proven to be accurate. So the skeptics' charges of collaboration are not at all credible.\n \n Abundant evidence of the deity of Jesus Christ is revealed through the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies and through symbols (also called types or shadows) of Jesus Christ. Thus, we can see how the coming of the Messiah was all in God's plan and was foretold in the Old Testament.\n \n Fulfilled Prophecies\n The following prophecies concerning Jesus Christ were given in the Old Testament during the time frame of approximately 1700 BC - 400 BC. These prophecies were fulfilled hundreds of years later, during Jesus Christ's life on earth. Each of the prophecies listed below are followed in parentheses by the scripture references for both the prophecy and the fulfillment.\n \n 1. He would be born of a Virgin (Isaiah 7:14 and Matthew 1:18). \n 2. He would be of the tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:10 and Luke 3:23, 33). \n 3. He would be of King David's seed (Jeremiah 23:5 and Luke 3:23, 31). \n 4. He would be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2 and Matthew 2:1). \n 5. He would be a prophet (Deuteronomy 18:18-19 and Matthew 21:11). \n 6. He would teach with parables (Psalms 78:2 and Matthew 13:34). \n 7. He would be preceded by a messenger (Isaiah 40:3, Malachi 3:1, and Matthew 3:1-2). \n 8. He would enter Jerusalem on a colt (Zechariah 9:9 and Luke 19:35-37). \n 9. He would be betrayed by a friend (Psalms 41:9 and Matthew 26:47-50). \n 10. He would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver (Zechariah 11:12 and Matthew 26:15). \n 11. He would be forsaken by His disciples (Zechariah 13:7 and Mark 14:50). \n 12. The money would be thrown in the temple and used to buy the potter's field (Zechariah 11:13 and Matthew 27:5-7). \n 13. He would be accused by false witnesses (Psalms 35:11 and Matthew 26:59-60). \n 14. He would be silent before His accusers (Isaiah 53:7 and Matthew 27:12-14). \n 15. He would be beaten by his enemies (Isaiah 50:6, 53:5, and Matthew 27:26). \n 16. He would be spit upon and beaten (Isaiah 50:6 and Matthew 27:30). \n 17. He would be struck in the head with a rod (Micah 5:1 and Matthew 27:30). \n 18. He would be mocked (Psalms 22:7-8 and Matthew 27:29, 31). \n 19. His hands and feet would be pierced (Psalms 22:16, Luke 23:33, and John 20:25).\n Note that this was predicted hundreds of years before crucifixion was invented. \n 20. Men would gamble for His clothing (Psalms 22:18 and John 19:23-24). \n 21. He would intercede in prayer for His transgressors (Isaiah 53:12 and Luke 23:34). \n 22. He would suffer thirst (Psalms 22:15 and John 19:28). \n 23. He would be offered gall and water (Psalms 69:21 and Matthew 27:34). \n 24. He would cry, \"My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me!\" (Psalms 22:1 and Matthew 27:46). \n 25. He would be cut down in His prime (Psalms 89:45 and 102:23-24). \n 26. None of His bones would be broken (Exodus 12:46, Psalms 34:20, and John 19:32-33). \n 27. They would look upon Him whom they had pierced (Zechariah 12:10 and John 19:34). \n 28. He would be executed with thieves (Isaiah 53:12 and Matthew 27:38). \n 29. He would be buried in a rich man's tomb (Isaiah 53:9 and Matthew 27:57-60).\n \n Note that the majority of these prophecies concern the death of Jesus Christ and the events surrounding it. This is especially interesting considering the fact that none of Christ's disciples realized that Jesus Christ was going to die.\n \n In Luke 18:33, Christ, referring to Himself as \"the Son of man\", told His disciples what would happen to Him, \"And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.\" That would have been pretty easy to understand, but God hid the saying from their understanding. The next verse, Luke 18:34, says, \"And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.\"\n \n Despite the fact that Jesus Christ had told them plainly, His disciples still did not realize He was going to die and rise again. The Jews knew from the Old Testament prophecies that the Messiah would be a King that would reign over Israel forever. So they naturally assumed (incorrectly) that the Messiah must never die. Not even His disciples knew about Christ's death, and the Old Testament prophets would have known even less. So there would be no reason for the Old Testament prophets to have written anything about the death of the Messiah, except for the divine hand of God who knew the future. The prophets themselves did not even understand that they were writing of the Messiah's death.\n \n Now we come to two of the most interesting prophecies:\n \n Messiah to come to His temple\n The Messiah, being preceded by a messenger (John the Baptist) will suddenly come to His temple. Malachi 3:1 says, \"Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in ....\" The Roman army destroyed Jerusalem and the temple in 70 AD, and the temple has not yet been rebuilt in all these 1900 plus years. Many non-Christian Jews have been looking for the Messiah to appear for centuries. But this passage makes it clear that the arrival of the Messiah could not have taken place between 70 AD and the present.\n \n Daniel's Prophecy of the 70 Weeks\n While the prophet Daniel was captive in Babylon in about 538 BC, God revealed the prophecy of Israel's 70 weeks to him in Daniel 9:24-26. \"Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people (Israel) and upon thy holy city (Jerusalem), to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off (killed), but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city (Jerusalem) and the sanctuary (the temple) ....\" In this prophecy, the following sequence of events are revealed.\n \n A. There would one day be a commandment to rebuild the city of Jerusalem, which the Babylonians had destroyed years earlier. This was fulfilled in 445 BC by Artaxerxes, king of the Medo-Persian Empire (465-424 BC), nearly a century after the prophecy was given. See Nehemiah 2:1-8 for the account of how Nehemiah asked Artaxerxes for the permission and the means to rebuild the ruins of the city of Jerusalem. In Nehemiah 2:1, we see that this took place \"... in the month Nisan (the first month of the Hebrew calendar which occurs in early spring), in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king (445 BC) ....\"\n \n B. From the giving of this commandment to the Messiah would be 69 weeks of years (seven plus threescore and two) after which the Messiah would be cut off (killed). This was fulfilled when Jesus Christ was crucified on the 14th day of Nisan (the passover) of 32 AD, right on schedule.\n \n Here is how the calculation of the 69 weeks of years works: Weeks of years are sevens of years, and seven times 69 is 483 years. But we know from the detail of the seventieth week provided in the book of Revelation, that these years are 360 days rather than the years on our present calendar which, figuring in leap years, are approximately 365.25 days. Revelation 12:14 describes the second half of the tribulation as \"a time, times, and half a time\" (1 + 2 + 1/2 = 3 1/2 years). Revelation 12:6 says this is \"a thousand two hundred and threescore (1260) days\", and Revelation 13:5 says it is \"forty and two months\". Since 1260 / 42 = 30 and 1260 / 3.5 = 360, we know that in this prophecy, God is counting months as 30 days each and years as 360 days each. Since the tribulation is a part of the 70 weeks of Daniel's prophecy, we know that the 360-day years must be used. So to see how many of our years this is, we calculate 483 * (360 / 365.25) = 476 years, 0 months, and a few days. Moving forward from the 445 BC date, this brings us to the early spring of 32 AD (476 - 445 + 1 = 32), when Jesus Christ was crucified. The one must be added to account for the fact that there is no \"year 0\". The year after 1 BC was 1 AD. The calculation here is somewhat simplified and shows that at a minimum, the prophecy was accurate to within a very few days. Some scholars have used additional evidence for the difficult task of calculating this prophecy to the exact day. To do this, they have to know the day of the month that the commandment of Artaxerxes was given plus the astrological history of moon phases as viewed from Jerusalem, since the months of the Hebrew calendar are based upon observance of the moon phases. As for me, I am more than satisfied to know that the prophecy was accurate to the month 5796 months in advance (12 * 483 = 5796), but readers who are inclined to pursue the more detailed calculation to the exact day are welcome to do so.\n \n Now one might wonder why God didn't use our 365.25-day years in His prophecy? We cannot be certain, but perhaps He was using the same number of days per year that the earth had when He created it. We know from Genesis 7:11 and 8:3-4 that a calendar with 30 day months was used before the great flood. It may be that in the catastrophe of the flood, the earth's rotational speed was increased slightly. One way this could happen would be if the earth's density were increased due to the tremendous seismic activity and the collapse of the water canopy which God used to trigger the flood. Genesis 7:11-12 says, \"... all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\" This increase of density would have increased the earth's rotational speed by reducing its moment of inertia in the same way that spinning ice skaters spin faster when they pull their out-stretched arms in closer to their bodies. If the period of the earth's revolution around the sun did not change, then there would be more days per year after the great flood than there were before the flood. Now let's continue to the next event in the sequence of the Daniel 9 prophecy.Evidence that Jesus Christ is the Messiah",

   "Id have to agree with the Jews for Jesus material being junk. Not neccesarily because of its content (although I'd definately check it twice!), but because of their methods. Standing outside synagogues on the Day of Atonement eating ham and cheese sandwiches openly and defiantly in front of disgusted Jewish worshippers, in order to \"witness\" to them that the law of Moses is done away with is just reprehensible. The New Testament would have several issues with that. As far as I know they've stopped that. \n \n These 'witnesses to the Jews' wait at bus stops and subway terminals I've even seen them at airports for God's sake, just literally accosting anyone wearing a skullcap and arguing with them to the point of yelling. I've had several run ins with them and in my opinion, I consider them anti-missionary in themselves, by distorting the gospel so thoroughly through their methods that I find it hard to believe crack addicts could see the truth in them.\n \n Over the years I have seen them tone down a little, but their organization still rightly carries the stigma they earned. They'd do far better to disband and form another one and keep on making progress on how to witness to anyone in general and Jews in particular. \n \n So you'd prove your points better citing the actual Bible verse or Jewish material that supports your point and making your own argument on why it is valid and applicable, rather than citing, posting, or linking to J4J junk.\n\n \n Putting aside your personal but irrelevant criticisms of the Jews for Jesus for a minute, is there anything about the factual content of this link which you can oppose as not being true and accurate scripturally? Are you denying for example, that Zechariah doesn't describe two different types of Messiah's? Or that two different types of Messiah's aren't described and expected through out OT Prophecies?\n \n \nWhy is it that you always pull a daewoo and boast and bluster and claim victory in advance as you make this about a personal attack by saying that Archangel \"FAILS\" when you never actually answer the question posed or prove anything at all? It is you who fails to comprehend what you are discussing at even the most basic level, spiritually speaking. Here in quotes is my original question.\n \n You see the bolded \"YET\" little child, the only thing you bring to this forum beside your denials of the truth in Gods word of course, is your incomparable ignorance of anything spiritual. You must attempt to impugn my intelligence by attempting to show that I fail somehow rather than just showing with real and true understanding, which you sorely lack, how the bible itself is wrong. You can't show this because it isn't wrong at all.\n \n You fail to understand that the bible very clearly describes and prophecies about 2 returning Kings/Messiah's. This is why so many Jews rejected Jesus, because He wasn't the conquering king they were seeking at the time of his coming. But hey, since you're a scoffer and a mocker who hates the truth and will never take my word for any of this, here's a link that will explain the two Messiah's: The Returning King: The \"Two Messiahs\" in Zechariah - http://www.jewsforjesus.org/publications/issues/15_5/returningking/ with an excerpt. Hopefully this will educate you to understand that not all prophecies have been fulfilled yet.\n The Returning King: The \"Two Messiahs\" in Zechariah\n \n Zechariah 9:9-10 -- A King of Peace\n \n Israel certainly had her share of disappointing kings. The books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles attest to this history. But in Zechariah 9:9-10, the prophet points to a coming king who is unique.\n \"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!\n Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem!\n Behold, your king is coming to you;\n He is just and endowed with salvation,\n Humble, and mounted on a donkey,\n Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\n And He will speak peace to the nations;\n And His dominion will be from sea to sea,\n And from the River to the ends of the earth.\"\n This isn't just any king. The prophet tells the people of Israel to be joyful, to get excited, because the promised one, the one sent from God, the long awaited king, is coming. And so this passage has been interpreted as messianic; that is, it is often supposed that the king in this passage is none other than the Messiah, the savior of Israel.\n \n Traditional Judaism teaches that, \"The messiah is a G-d fearing, pious Jew, who is both a Torah scholar and a great leader. He is to be a direct descendent of King David, anointed as the new Jewish King. (In fact, the Hebrew word for messiah 'Moshiach' means 'anointed one.')\"1\n \n Many Jewish people do not give much thought to the coming of a Messiah anymore, and those who do often picture him as a mighty conqueror, even a superhero-type figure. But here in Zechariah 9 the picture is very different the king is not coming to fight a war; he comes in gentleness and meekness. He is the king over all the earth and he has all authority, but he comes in this humble fashion, riding on a baby donkey, as opposed to a chariot or even a great horse.\n \n This passage of Scripture provides a picture of a Messiah-king, a deliverer of salvation, gently offering his kingship to Israel and to the world he is a man of peace for all peoples. He will proclaim peace to all the nations, not just to Israel.\n \n In our world today peaceful people may win prizes, but they don't necessarily command authority. We've come to expect a certain amount of confidence, even arrogance, from our leaders. We expect them to do what they have to do to maintain order. Especially in Israel and the Middle East, it is difficult to fathom that someone could come to such power on peaceful terms. A king who does not fight? Yet in this passage, that is exactly what is promised.\n \n Zechariah 14:2-4 -- A King of War\n \n Later, however, Zechariah gives another description of the coming king, a picture quite different from that of chapter 9. Let's take a brief look at the context for his statement:\n \"For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured. Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.\"\n This picture is very much like an epic battle scene from a movie full of bloodshed and tragedy and triumph. Then in verses 8-9 we read:\n \"And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the Lord will be king over all the earth; in that day the Lord will be the only one, and His name the only one.\"\n Chapters 9 and 14 are the central passages in Zechariah telling of this king who will reign over all the earth. In chapter 9 the king is humble, but in chapter 14 he is a force to be reckoned with. In the latter picture, the king is a conqueror; he comes in wrath, meting out judgment to the enemies of Israel. This is perhaps a more traditional picture of Messiah, a mighty hero who fights on our behalf.\n \n Mysteriously, this passage seems to suggest that this Messiah-king is none other than the Lord God himself, God coming to fight on behalf of his people (see page 8). In any case, we are presented with a dramatically different picture of the king here than the one we see in Zechariah 9.\n \n Two Descriptions, Two Kings?\n \n So the question is, does this king who reigns over all the earth come gently, riding on a donkey in peace? Or in great wrath, ready to do battle? Is Zechariah contradicting himself? This is a big puzzle for Jewish scholars as well. But this is not the only place in the Scriptures where we find seemingly divergent pictures of Messiah (see chart on page 5). For example, Micah 5 tells us he is born in Bethlehem, the city of David. But in Daniel 7 the prophet tells us he will arrive, riding on the clouds of heaven. Is the Messiah going to be cut off (killed) as predicted in Daniel 9, or will he come in regal splendor and reign forever, as Isaiah 9 tells us? Is he the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 or a royal king portrayed in Psalm 2?\n \n In response to these two seemingly opposite pictures of Messiah, some rabbis decided that there must be two messiahs, the Messiah ben Yosef who would come and suffer and Messiah ben David, who would come as a conquering king.\n \n Another Jewish tradition explains the two contrasting portraits of Messiah like this: \"If the people of Israel will be righteous, the Messiah will come in the clouds of Heaven. If they will not be righteous, he will come as a poor man riding upon an XXX\" (Sanhedrin 98a).\n \n Are such explanations necessary or is it possible that one individual might \"fit the bill\" of both pictures; someone who would be both a king of peace and a king of power, a humble servant and a conqueror? If so, what would this extraordinary person look like?\n \n The Once and Future King\n \n There is still another Jewish view concerning the two pictures of the Messiah-king that accurately fulfills the portrait we see in Zechariah and elsewhere in the Hebrew Scriptures. This view actually predates the other two mentioned. It's the position presented in the New Testament.\n \n The writers of the New Testament were Jewish people, living in the first century, who believed that the prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures described one Messiah, a great king who was to come twice, first as a servant, then as conqueror. They believed that Y'shua (Jesus) was the fulfillment of both expectations.\n \n Y'shua was not a typical king. His was a life marked by humility. He was a man of gentleness and peace. But the peace he offered was different from what most people think about it was a peace that comes from the depth of personal spiritual solutions that Y'shua offered to people who would follow him.\n So cmon back daewoo, er, I mean little child. (Sorry, it's just so easy to confuse you two based on your dishonest style of attacking and using intimidation while proving nothing at all.) And tell me how complete your understanding is of the bible and prophecy as you again claim I fail. Only in debating you and when relying on your complete ignorance do I seem to fail in these debates according to your irrational rants.\n \n PS. And pappillion001 this post is directed at you also. I see no reason to repeat myself since this answers your ignorance of the facts also. Thanks for playing though... :)\n",

   "There's all kinds of problems with your examples and your depiction of the Messiah, the genealogy of Jesus, etc. Your example above is not even universally shared by other Jews. For instance:\n \n \"We find rabbinic sources which also agree that God reversed the curse on Jeconiah, which they attribute to repentance on Jeconiah's part. We even find the idea that the Messiah will descend from Jeconiah--exactly the opposite of what some say is impossible! Some of these sources are as follows:\" \n \n Jewish Encyclopedia \n \n Jehoiachin's sad experiences changed his nature entirely, and as he repented of the sins which he had committed as king he was pardoned by God, who revoked the decree to the effect that none of his descendants should ever become king (Jer. xxii.30; Pesik., ed. Buber, xxv. 163a, b): he even became the ancestor of the Messiah (Tan., Toledot, 20 [ed. Buber, i. 140]). --Louis Ginzberg, \"Jehoiachin,\" vol. 7 p. 84. \n \n Rabbi A. J. Rosenberg on Jeremiah 22:24 (20th c.) \n \n Malbim calls to our attention that in the prophecy of Haggai (2:23), God says, \"On that day I will take you, Zerubbabel, and I will make you like a signet,\" for the King Messiah will be like a signet ring on God's right hand, so to speak. Just as the name of the owner of the ring is engraved on his signet ring, through which he makes himself known, so will God's name be known in the world through the King Messiah, through whom His miracles will be known. He says here that, though, in the future, Coniah will be the signet on My right hand, for the Messiah will spring from his seed, now I will remove him from there. --Ibid., p. 183. Malbim is an acronym for Meir Loeb ben Jehiel Michale, a 19th c. rabbi and commentator. 22:24. \n \n Encyclopedia Judaica \n \n Even the decree that none of his descendants would ascend the throne (Jer. 22:30) was repealed when Zerubbabel was appointed leader of the returned exiles (cf. Sanh. 37b-38a). --\"Jehoiachin\" (9:1319). \n \n Rabbi A. J. Rosenberg, on Jeremiah 22:30 (20th c.) \n \n In this, too, no man of his seed shall prosper, namely that no one will occupy the throne of David nor rule in Judah. Although we find that Zerubbabel, his great grandson, did rule over Judah upon the return of the exiles, the Rabbis (Pesikta d'Rav Kahana p. 163a) state that this was because Jehoiachin repented while in prison. They state further: Repentance is great, for it nullifies a person's sentence, as it is stated: 'Inscribe this man childless.' But since he repented, his sentence was revoked and turned to the good, and he said to him, \"I will take you, Zerubbabel, and I will make you a signet\" (Haggai 2:23). They state further: Said Rabbi Johanan: Exile expiates all sins, as it is said: \"Inscribe this man childless,\" and after he was exiled, it is written: '(1 Chron. 3:17) And the sons of Jeconiah, Assir, Shealtiel his son'--[Redak]. --A. J. Rosenberg, Jeremiah: A New English Translation (New York: Judaica Press, 1985), vol. 1 p. 185. \"Redak\" is an acronym for Rabbi David Kimchi (13th c.), whose opinion Rosenberg cites. The Problem of the Curse on Jeconiah in Relation to the Genealogy of Jesus - http://www.jewsforjesus.org/answers/prophecy/jeconiah/\n \n Second, it's not a biological son of Jeconiah, or of Solomon who is going to be the Messiah, but God / the Son of God (Jeremiah 23:5-6, Isaiah 9:6-7, Psalm 2, etc.).  This is confirmed in Matthew, that that which was conceived in Mary is of the Holy Spirit (God - Matthew 28:19; Acts 5, etc.).\n \n You say: \"According to the Bible, the Messiah must be a descendent of David through his son Solomon (II Sam. 7:14;...)\" \n \n That's highly debatable also:\n \n Note carefully the language used about Solomon: \"I will establish his kingdom...I will establish his throne forever....I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever\" (1 Chronicles 17). \n \n There was, however, a divine condition clearly laid out: \"I will establish his kingdom forever IF he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws, as is being done at this time\" (1 Chronicles 28:7). Was Solomon unswerving in carrying out God's commands and laws? Hardly!  The scriptural record is very clear:\n \n From 1 Kings 11:1-8 - \n \n 1 King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughter-Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites. 2 They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, \"You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.\" Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love. 3 He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. 4 As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been. 5 He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech [a] the detestable god of the Ammonites. 6 So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not follow the LORD completely, as David his father had done. \n \n 7 On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites. 8 He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods. \n \n From 1 Kings 11:9-13\n \n 9 The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD's command. 11 So the LORD said to Solomon, \"Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates. 12 Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son. 13 Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.\" \n \n Solomon did not meet God's conditions, and his throne was not established forever. It is the Throne of David's which was to meet the condition. (Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus, Vol. 4, pages 90-91)\n\n \n This interpretation is a possibility, you never mention that the throne was never restored after the exile and a governorship was the rank restored to the line. It also calls into question Gods choice of words. Your version makes God a being driven by emotion who says one thing in anger and later regrets and forgives.\n \n I could argue the point but that would simply distract from the bigger picture. You can have this one undisputed, what about the 20+ other reasons from my two earlier posts?\n \n I have said before and will say it again, I am not with all of this looking to convince anybody there is no God. I think questioning the validity and integrity of scripture is not the same as questioning the validity or integrity of God. I think the evidence is overwhelming that man has reworded, lost, forgotten, withheld and manipulated scripture. The reasons are not as important as the the fact it happened, except maybe to the degree that reasons can assist in restoration. Knowing that what we have today is not what we began with I am surprised, especially from those of faith, there is more effort to keep the distortions than to correct them.\n \n Look at it this way if you signed a contract and 20 years later the other party was not in compliance with the terms of the agreement showing you a contract that had been altered to justify their actions, would you accept that? Would you look for your copy and comapare to see what was changed to see what were the real terms and conditions?",

They are not and never were, for example a homogenous society that held to one unerring belief in the messiah. This particular anti missionary document uses some material/extra reading from if not total believers then former believers that Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson was and/or as I've heard up to a few years past his death still might be the messiah. I don't hang out among Chabad followers like I used to though. I'm geographically removed from them at present. Many statements on the anti missionary document might be said to be the majority opinion on the matters it discusses, it may well be. But that it denies the concepts of alternative views regarding the messiah among Judaism is laughable and I'd think insulting. Kind of like saying every Christian in the world believes that the Pope forgives their sin and bows down to images of Mary. \n \n Just off the top of my head, there were 3 isms among Judaism during Jesus' time 2 of them mentioned in the Bible (Saduccees and Pharisees), along with the Essenes mentioned by Josephus. There were undoubtably more, and even factions within these groups that competed for power based on opposing ideas.

   "\n \n I could argue the point but that would simply distract from the bigger picture. You can have this one undisputed, what about the 20+ other reasons from my two earlier posts? \n\n \n I'll pick your best one, IMO.\n \n You wrote: 9) The claim that Jesus will fulfill the Messianic prophesies when he returns does not give him any credibility for his &#8220;first&#8221; coming. The Bible never speaks about the Messiah returning after an initial appearance. The &#8220;second coming&#8221; theory is a desperate attempt to explain away Jesus&#8217; failure. The Biblical passages which Christians are forced to regard as second coming (#5 above) don&#8217;t speak of someone returning, they have a &#8220;first coming&#8221; perspective. \n \n As you are probably aware, there are a number of ancient rabbinic quotes that regard Isaiah 53 as the Messiah. Here's a link to some of them, and one example:\n \n Isaiah 53 Rabbinical Commentary\n \n Rabbi Moses Alschech(1508-1600) says, concerning Isaiah 53:\n \"Our Rabbis with one voice accept and affirm the opinion that the prophet is speaking of the Messiah, and we shall ourselves also adhere to the same view.\"\n \n We can debate the modern Jewish interpretation that Isaiah speaks of Israel (and not the Messiah) at another time. But for now, I'll stand with the ancient Rabbis and agree Isaiah 53 speaks of the Messiah.\n \n Isaiah 53:1-12 \n \n Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?\n 2 He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.\n 3 He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.\n 4 Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted.\n 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.\n 6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.\n 7 He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.\n 8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken.\n 9 He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.\n 10 Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand.\n 11 After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied ; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.\n 12 Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.\n \n Obviously, the \"Suffering Servant\" of Isaiah 53 dies. Yet in verse 10 we see this:\n \n \"Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand.\n \n And that's the 2nd Coming. Though he dies, yet his days are prolonged, and he will see his (spiritual) offspring.\n \n By the way, nowhere in the Old Testament does it say the Messiah will only come once.\n \n In fact, Daniel 9:25-27 speaks of the Messiah, though some deny that. I have a number of Rabbinic quotes if you'd like to see them, confirming this passage speaks of the Messiah. \n \n Anyway, the Jews always teach that when Messiah comes, there will be peace. But in Daniel 9:25-27 the Messiah is \"cut off\" (an idiom for being killed) and then WAR REIGNS UNTIL THE END.  So the Messiah comes, is killed, then there is war, and we know from other scriptures that eventually there is peace. \n \n So either the Jews need to change their theology to accomodate what I just presented, or there's two Messiahs that must come, OR there's just one Messiah with a 2nd Coming. The latter fits the scriptures the best.",

Which is it, EZ?\n \n That is certainly one of the most clear verses on that, but there are also others.\n \n How about Luke 21:32, Matthew 24 (esp. verse 34), and Mark 13:30?\n \n From Matthew 24: \n \nJesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings.\n 2 Do you see all these things? he asked. I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\n \n 3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. Tell us, they said, when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?\n \n 4 Jesus answered: Watch out that no-one deceives you.\n \n 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many.\n \n 6 You will hear of wars and rumours of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.\n \n 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.\n \n 8 All these are the beginning of birth-pains.\n \n 9 Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.\n \n 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other,\n \n 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.\n \n 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,\n \n 13 but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.\n \n 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\n \n 15 So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation', spoken of through the prophet Daniel&#8212; let the reader understand&#8212;\n \n 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.\n \n 17 Let no-one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house.\n \n 18 Let no-one in the field go back to get his cloak.\n \n 19 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!\n \n 20 Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.\n \n 21 For then there will be great distress, unequalled from the beginning of the world until now&#8212; and never to be equalled again.\n \n 22 If those days had not been cut short, no-one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.\n \n 23 At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it.\n \n 24 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect&#8212; if that were possible.\n \n 25 See, I have told you ahead of time.\n \n 26 So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.\n \n 27 For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.\n \n 28 Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.\n \n 29 Immediately after the distress of those days\n \n 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'\n \n \n \n 30At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.\n \n 31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.\n \n 32 Now learn this lesson from the fig-tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.\n \n 33 Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.\n \n 34 I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.\n 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.\n \n \n\n \n (I'll also note off topic the discrepancy between verse 27: For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. with the verse in which he claims his coming will be like a thief in the night. You cannot get any more opposite from a thief than a visible lightning stormemoticon_cool )\n \n \n And those are just Jesus' words. We also see the same elsewhere, such as in 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17: \n \n \nAccording to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.\n\n \n So even the early Christians beleived the statement I mentioned at the top of the post, and note that it was made by Jesus. Interesting, isn't it?",

   "Alright then, let's look at a few of them.\n \n We have (what C.S. Lewis called \"the most embarassing verse in the Bible\" IIRC): Matthew 16:28, Mark 9:1, and Luke 9:27 all saying the exact same thing: \n \n \n So, either some of these people are still alive, or Jesus already came and you missed it, or he lied. Which is it, EZ?\n \n\n \n Like I said, you're a rookie.\n \n Does Matthew 16:28 teach the kingdom already came on earth and it has been here all along?\n \n V.27-28 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\"\n \n First it says they will see the Son of man coming in his kingdom before they died. They did. The next chapter continues:\n \n Matt 17:1 Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, led them up on a high mountain by themselves.\"\n \n In Mark 9:1-10: And He said to them, \"Assuredly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will not taste death till they see the kingdom of God present with power.\" Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves; and He was transfigured before them.\n \n Also Luke 9:27-37: \"But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God.\" Now it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray\".\n \n So how did they see this? They saw the glory of His kingdom on the Mt. of Transfiguration. \n \n Mk.9:2 \"He was transfigured before them- the light came from within him not from without showing the glory that was hidden from them since his birth. This is why Jesus is called \"the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person\" (Heb 1:3) he forever is \"the Lord of glory\" (1 Cor .2:8). When John sees Jesus in heaven he is enthroned, and seen in his glory revealed. Rev 1:16 \"His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength.\n \n While Jesus is PRAYING he is transfigured; and Moses and Elijah both appear in glory (Lk.9). Matthew states Jesus' face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light, Mark reports He was transfigured that his clothes became shining, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them . Luke says the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe became white and glistening. His glory showed through his human nature, even his clothes.\n \n Mt.17 \"While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, \"This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!\" If they were not there for his baptism when God spoke from heaven and the Spirit came upon him like a dove, they were here experiencing something more spectacular. Just as a cloud covered the mountain and the glory of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days (Exod. 24:15-18) Moses once again is on a Mountain engulfed in the cloud and hearing God's voice from heaven. This too is called a holy mountain by Peter.\n \n The presence of Moses and Elijah are associated with the kingdom, they were expected by the Jewish people to return at the end of the age with the Messiah. This is why Peter wanted to build them tabernacles. He thought the kingdom had arrived with their being present and seeing Jesus glorified.\n \n The three closest disciples were given a preview of what it would be like in the kingdom, this is how Peter describes it in 2 Pt. 1:16-18 \" For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming (parousia) of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with him on the Holy mountain.\"\n \n Jesus said previously, some would not die until they see the coming of the kingdom in power.\" They did even though it was temporary. (letusreason.org)\n \n And just so you will have knowledge of Jesus' Kingdom:\n \n Question: \"What is the Kingdom of God?\"\n \n Answer: The kingdom of God is the rule of an eternal sovereign God over all creatures and things (Psalm 103:19; Daniel 4:3). The kingdom of God is also the designation for the sphere of salvation entered into at the new birth (John 3:5-7), and is synonymous with the \"kingdom of heaven.\"\n \n The kingdom of God embraces all created intelligence, both in heaven and earth that are willingly subject to the Lord and are in fellowship with Him. The kingdom of God is, therefore, universal in that it includes created angels and men. It is eternal, as God is eternal, and it is spiritual-found within all born-again believers. We enter the kingdom of God when we are born again, and we are then part of that kingdom for eternity. It is a relationship \"born of the spirit\" (John 3:5), and we have confident assurance that it is so because the Spirit bears witness with our spirits (Romans 8:16). (Gotquestions.org)\n \n Nice try, though.\n \n I'll be back in a few minutes to potty-train you on your other question.\n \n By the way, what evidence do you have for the so-called goddess \"Brigid\"?

   "I don't think the historical Jesus of Nazareth would have oked waterboarding -- or, I don't see any basis for such an assertion. He himself was tortured to death since execution by way of crucifixion was a slow and suffering ordeal. Interestingly enough, though this a central characteristic of the story -- i.e. death by way of torture -- Christianity, in its organized form, over the centuries, has advocated and employed such methods itself, and rather indiscriminately.\n \n I do give John McCain credit for coming out against torture, and as someone who experienced it himself. At first, he seemed to cave in a bit to the pressure of his party, but I think (or like think) that he eventually \"came to\" himself and remembered what he was about, including his own views, as a Christian.\n \n Torture is wrong; there's really no way around this, folks. If you'll permit me the license: you'll lose your soul in this labyrinth. I don't doubt that some people involved in our government believed they were acting in the best interests of Americans. And I'm sure, at times, they really do get information that's important. But overall, the best of torturers will tell you that it's highly unreliable, and, most importantly, I think you all know, in your heart of hearts, that this is simply wrong. And it's terrible, terrible global leadership.\n \n To the person (I'm sorry, your handle slips my recall, at the moment) who said \"a room filled with women libbers\" would defend the notion of free will ... well, I am a \"women's libber\" and I do not defend the notion of free will. I don't discount its possibility, but all the evidence shows me that free will is a ridiculous misnomer, and something that doesn't exist. We live in a universe based on laws of cause and effect and there is no decision made by a human being which happens apart from natural reasons.\n \n That doesn't mean I don't believe that people have RIGHTS. I most certainly do, and I most certainly believe women are no less entitled to rights than men.\n \n Aren't you a \"women's libber\"? Don't you think so?\n \n It's self-evidently thus! ;)",

   "By the way, and this is true, you can ask Archie:\n \n Archie believes in the existence of dragons, yes, the kind of animals slaughtered by Saint George. \n\n \n Here's an interesting one. Unlike most posts that winston writes, this drivel is actually worth responding to. Regarding Dragons, I have never said I believe in their absolute existence. What I have argued in debates, and produced, is the extensive evidence from numerous eye witness accounts which have survived the centuries. And these accounts are recorded in many diverse civilizations and cultures which had little or no contact with each other at the time. \n \n I marvel at the poor deductive reasoning of these deniers of historical events and creatures which they reject out of hand for no practical or logical reason at all. When the same creature which happens to be extinct now existed in so many diverse cultures over so many centuries, it boggles the mind that people can insist that these are shared myths.\n \n Here's a link which describes many various historical references to Dragons, or were they Dinosaurs? We don't know. But something existed as recently as a thousand years ago which people called Dragons, and which modern day atheists and evolutionists deny existed at all since they refuse to accept that man has coexisted with dinosaurs. Dinosaurs\n \n It's the same thing with the Great Flood. Pretty much every single ancient civilization on Earth had(s) a flood myth. And it is absolutely impossible that it was shared from one original story and passed along since we are dealing with a time before world wide travel occurred unless it did happen. If it is a true myth, then there is no explanation for it existing all over the world as it does. \n \n Here is a link which documents flood traditions from around the world. Explain the similarities if these are just myths which have no original basis in fact at all. Abiogenesis and the Origin of Life \n \n What this evidence shows is that there is much we don't know and can't confirm today regarding our recent ancient history. And yet we have people right here on this forum which declare without doubt that alleged evidence of evolution which makes claims going back hundreds of millions of years is absolutely correct.

   "Not only that, is it so odd that there are flood myths? Civilizations tend to form on rivers, due to water for both farming and transportation (trade).\n \n Rivers flood.

Terra is a fascinating program, but what is perhaps most fascinating about it is that it exists because its creator, John Baumgardner, is a fundamentalist Christian who believes, in accordance with the Bible, that the Earth was created by God less than 10,000 years ago.\n \n In fact, Baumgardner created Terra expressly to prove that the story of Noah and the flood of Genesis 7:18--\"And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the Earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters\"--happened exactly as the Bible tells it. Not only did he come up with a tool used by geophysicists around the world but his \"numerical code\" actually proves the Bible is correct. Or at least in Baumgardner's view it does. Back to Scripture.\n \n The question of origins has bedeviled Western civilization ever since the explanations offered by religion collided with science. Terra is an attempt to reconcile the most literal reading of Scripture with the most advanced science in existence. Written in the computer language Fortran, Terra takes the spatial volume of the Earth's mantle--2,000 miles of silicate rock that surrounds the Earth's solid iron core--and imagines it as 10 million three-dimensional cells. The mantle rock is in a solid state, but over millions of years it moves and flows, behaving as if it were a fluid, not a solid. Deeper than 100 miles inside the Earth, rock reaches 70 percent to 80 percent of its melting temperature--between 4,000 and 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The mantle rock churns or \"convects\" for the same reasons boiling water rolls in a pot: Cooler, heavier material (water in the pot, silicate in the Earth) on top sinks while hotter material nearest the heat source (the flame under the pot, the Earth's core) is lighter, and so rises.\n \n Terra divides the mantle into hexagonal cells, assigning each one a value for heat, direction, velocity, and other unknowns as if creating 10 million small blocks to make up an immense, three-dimensional Rubik's cube. Terra then \"runs\" each piece through time and watches where each will go. Add all the pieces together, and Terra gives you a 3-D map of a huge mass convecting through time. A young computer expert named Jamie Painter last year created a powerful graphical program so that Terra can express in pictures what it is calculating mathematically. On a television in the lab you can watch the stunning images of the planet's interior moving before you. Neon greens and blues representing cooler material swirl with hot yellows and fiery reds inside a sphere, and you see how the mantle has pushed the continents around on the planet's surface from, say, 120 million years ago, during the Cretaceous Period, up until today. Dramatic conversion.\n \n Baumgardner, however, believes that not only the Earth, which most geologists estimate is 4.6 billion years old, but also the universe itself, which astrophysicists peg at around 13 billion years, is actually only a few thousand years old. He did not always take the Bible so literally. Fifty-three years old and 6 feet tall, he grew up on a farm near Lubbock, Texas, the eldest of four children. His father was a professor of animal nutrition at Texas Tech, and his family was, as he tells it, essentially agnostic. But after getting a master's from Princeton in electrical engineering and returning to Texas (he also has a Ph.D. in geophysics from UCLA), he joined a Presbyterian college Sunday school class. \"I'd never encountered people who were studying the Bible like one would study any other subject,\" he says. \"It turned out they were studying the Gospel of John in the New Testament, verse by verse, which largely focuses on the question of who is this person, Jesus Christ. And I had to admit that never in my life had I considered that question.\" Baumgardner experienced what he calls \"a dramatic conversion experience, something I didn't expect. My attitude toward the opposite sex changed significantly. I had been in a rather exploitative mode up to that point. I found that I used to drink to relax and be more friendly with people, and all of a sudden I found myself with a better high than I'd ever known before and I sensed that the alcohol was impairing it. It was like a curtain was pulled back on a dimension, a supernatural dimension, that I'd never known before. It was the biggest discovery of my life.\"\n \n For the first five years after this epiphany, Baumgardner \"didn't give that much attention to the issue of creation. I was well indoctrinated in evolutionary theory.\" But that changed as he moved deeper into Christianity, which brought him to the \"conviction . . . that indeed there had been a major catastrophe in the Earth's past that accounts for a large fraction of the geological features we observe at the Earth's surface today.\" Baumgardner believes that around 6,000 years ago, when \"God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the Earth\" (Genesis 6:5), he caused an enormous blob of hot mantle material to come rushing up at incredible velocity through the underwater mid-ocean ridges. The material ballooned, displacing a tidal wave of seawater over the continents. This, Baumgardner says, was the flood on which Noah sailed, the water covering the mountains and destroying \"every living substance . . . which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle.\" Then, after 150 days (Genesis 7:24), the bubble retreated with equal speed into the Earth, and the continents began re-emerging above the water, sending the runoff back to the oceans at around 100 miles an hour. (A very fast river with a huge erosion capacity runs at only about 10 miles an hour.)\n \n Baumgardner says that this runoff would have been sufficient to create the Grand Canyon and other massive geologic features and to deposit the various sedimentary layers in about one week. The science Baumgardner uses to account for these extraordinary happenings is a sort of niche physics called runaway subduction. A theory proposed in the 1960s under another name by a physicist at General Electric, runaway subduction posits that the potential energy in the cold, heavy crust of the Earth is like the potential energy in a rock held above the ground. Drop the rock, and its potential energy is turned by gravity into kinetic energy, and into heat when it hits the ground. As gravity pulls the rock, so it pulls the gigantic, heavy plates of ocean floor under the continents into the hotter, lighter mantle, which is silicate rock. As the plates deform the surrounding rock, the mechanical energy of deformation is converted into heat, creating a superheated \"envelope\" of silicate around the sinking ocean floor. Silicate is very sensitive to heat, so it becomes weaker, allowing the plates to sink faster and heating the envelope still further, and so on, faster and faster. As the plates pull apart, the gap between them grows into a broadening seam in the planet. This sends a giant bubble of mantle shooting up through these ridges. Which displaces the oceans. Which creates a huge flood. Which sets to floating a small, gopher-wood ark containing one human family and every animal, two by two.\n \n By the numbers. Terra proves that this is true--or, more precisely, that it could be true, provided one accepts certain assumptions. Run Terra one way, and you can watch Noah's flood take place before your eyes, mathematically calculated by a supercomputer. Run Terra another way, and you get the standard geological story of 4.6 billion years. The results obtained from the code are--as Baumgardner readily points out--dependent on the numbers fed into it in the first place. Almost all physicists calculate the age of the planet at 4.6 billion years because they assume that mantle viscosity--a measure of the rock's liquidlike flow--has been consistent throughout time and so use the value that applies today. They add other ingredients like the speed of the tectonic plates--measured, for example, by the displacement across the two sides of the San Andreas fault--and arrive at the conclusion that one full deformation cycle of the mantle occurs about every hundred million years, giving the 4.6 billion figure. But Baumgardner says scientists wrongly assume that geology happens consistently, that there could have been no catastrophe, no Noah's flood. \"If you look at the geological record,\" he insists, \"there are fingerprints of catastrophe everywhere one looks.\"\n \n Baumgardner offers the following physical evidence for his views: He notes, first, that different radiometric dating methods give vastly different ages. To date rock, geologists commonly use three types of unstable (radioactive) \"parent\" isotopes--samarium, rubidium, and potassium--which decay into stable \"daughter\" elements: neodymium, strontium, and argon. The rates of decay of these elements are well known, and thus the ratio of parent-to-daughter elements in a rock reveals its age. But different isotopes yield different dates for the same rocks. As an example, Baumgardner points to the Cardenas basalt, a Precambrian volcanic rock found in the Grand Canyon's inner gorge. He says the rock has been dated at 1.7 billion years using samarium, at 1.1 billion years with rubidium, and at 0.7 billion years with potassium. \"All I'm saying as a scientist,\" says Baumgardner, \"is that there's reason to question radiometric measurements.\" He also cites several odd features about the layers of the sedimentary record, such as the common geological feature of erosional channels, like the sunken rivers running through Zion National Park. The walls of these channels, created by rainwater eroding uplifted terrain, show the cross sections of sedimentary layers laid down over millenniums.\n \n But while the evidence of erosion and sedimentation is all around (the Mississippi Delta, the Ganges taking soil from the Himalayas), surprisingly few erosional channels can be seen in the sedimentary layers themselves. \"In my opinion, the present is emphatically not the key to the past as far as the geological record goes,\" Baumgardner says. Fossil record. Another piece of evidence he points to is the fact that coal--fossilized plant matter--is found in concentrated seams rather than spread out, as forests generally are. This indicates to Baumgardner that a huge mass of water--a flood--swept floating trees together, depositing them in thick layers. He points out that the sedimentary layer in the Grand Canyon known as the \"Tapeats sandstone,\" which contains the first evidence of multicellular life (trilobite trackways), also contains evidence of catastrophic violence. Baumgardner believes this layer marks the beginning of the Genesis flood, which killed every antediluvian creature, including the dinosaurs, which were not saved by God in Noah's ark. (Baumgardner believes that humans and dinosaurs coexisted before the flood and, citing Job 40-41, believes in fire-breathing dinosaurs--what we would call dragons.) This layer is the location of the Cambrian explosion--the fossil record of a sudden burgeoning of life, with almost every phylum represented, from starfish to vertebrates to arthropods.\n \n Among geologists, there is universal agreement that Baumgardner's views are simply wrong. The fact that the sedimentary record contains anomalies is unremarkable, they say. There are always anomalies. The real debate is about physics and belief. Runaway subduction, these scientists add, requires the suspension of the most basic laws of physics. The theory requires a Through the Looking Glass world where nothing is as it seems and no scientific principle--from gravity and electromagnetism on down--exists as it exists today. Baumgardner himself says, \"The only way to square the radiometric data with a flood that caused all these changes is to conclude that one aspect of the catastrophe was rapid radioactive decay.\" But what this means is that for a few years the universe behaved completely differently, compressing processes which now take millions of years into merely days.\n \n This is not impossible. It just contradicts almost every existing piece of evidence. Brad Hager, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology geophysicist, notes that the time scale of the Earth is determined by how fast rocks conduct heat, or \"thermal diffusivity.\" \"If you were to choose,\" says Hager, \"to believe that by some miracle the diffusivity of the Earth was different before we learned to measure it, then you could speed up these calculations. But it would mean that rocks conducted heat differently in the past.\" Yet Hager has only respect for Baumgardner's computer program. Indeed, there is universal agreement that Terra, created to prove the Bible literally true, is one of the most useful and powerful geological tools in existence. \"Baumgardner is seen as one of the world leaders in numerical models of mantle convection,\" says Hager. Agrees Gerald Schubert of the University of California--Los Angeles Department of Earth and Space Sciences: \"As far as the code goes, Baumgardner is a world-class scientist.\" Baumgardner the Christian is well known in Los Alamos. Most people shake their heads wryly or with open irritation at the mention of his name. Abe Jacobson, an atmospheric scientist, says Baumgardner is \"known here in the Los Alamos community as a Christian rabble-rouser.\n \n My wife is a schoolteacher here, and Baumgardner regularly takes issue with the teaching of evolution in the public schools, but personally he is nice enough.\" Baumgardner the scientist, however, is accepted completely among scientists, perhaps because he so easily maintains what Jacobson calls his \"disconnect.\" He does not push his religious views on his colleagues. \"I've never become personally involved in these issues,\" says Hager. \"I avoid discussing the topic with John.\" In Los Alamos, Baumgardner, his wife, Jean, and their daughter regularly attend Calvary Chapel, which sits atop a mesa over the Rio Grande. Most members of the church believe, as Baumgardner does, that God created the river around 6,000 years ago. Terra can prove this for them. Or it can prove that the ancestral Rio Grande flowed massively across this plain in the late Tertiary Period, between 2 and 5 million years ago. One can look down at the river from Calvary Chapel's mesa and believe whatever one wants to about it. Belief does not need the blessing of science. But to John Baumgardner both a Christian and a scientist, apparently it does.\n \n A. Terra models thermal convection of the Earth's mantle over time and can calculate its past and future, representing the flow graphically. B. In this frame, Terra adds heat from the Earth's core to the equation. C. Here, the program takes into account increasing pressure at greater depths inside the Earth. D. The model can also add the variable of density or strength, which increases with depth.Global Flood - The Geophysics of God\n \n Can Flood geology explain thick chalk beds?\n \n Startling evidence for Noah's Flood\n \n Coal beds and Noah's Flood\n \n And let's not forget this link: Flood Stories from Around the World  Maybe someone will now answer my question as to why so many diverse cultures and people had so many common themes to their own flood traditions before world wide communication was even possible.",

If you bothered to actually look at the flood stories, very few of them share anything in common aside from water. Many of them have large numbers of people surviving. Many are river/lake based and don't flood the entire world. Many have survivors only surviving because they swam and certain Gods within their polytheistic views intervened. Only a relative few bother to save animals.\n \n Explain to me how the Chinese flood stories were the river floods just the country because a mythical dragon is angry yet thousands of people survived is the same flood story as that found in the Bible. \n \n You won't because you can't.

In fact several (actually many) contradict the stories it claims are proof of a global flood. Not to mention the sheer lack of any physical evidence. We know for a fact that you cannot defend your global flood belief on the basis of science. It took 20 pages before a creationist attempted to deal with the arguments in the cited thread.

Since when? In the link I just proved, I cited a regional flood as actually plausible. I allegedly can't explain the origins...... despite doing just that over two years ago, not to mention discussing how rivers actually flood and how floods are a common occurrence on this planet. \n \n \nOnce again you make absolute statements without offering one iota of evidence to support your claim.\n\n \n Anyone who's read this thread knows exactly what I'm talking about. \n \n \nFor you to now, today, claim that because every Messianic Prophecy has yet to be fulfilled when the Messiah's work on Earth with Humanity is not yet completed is the epitome of hubris and arrogance, not to mention a complete ignorance of Gods word. But that pretty much defines you, doesn't it!\n\n \n But to shut your lying mouth up, here's your quote. \n http://www.4forums.com/political/357606-post203.html\n \n Your argument is that Christ is the Jewish Messiah because he will allegedly at some unspecified point in time return and fulfill all of the requirements. \n \n The problem is that such logic dictates that anyone from the future qualifies as the Jewish Messiah on such grounds. There is absolutely no evidence for Christ's eventually return or that he will actually fulfill the requirements other then the written word of people long dead. I can write that Joe Noname is actually the Messiah and write he will fulfill the prophecies. Both have the same level of truth. And neither can be proven. \n \n Your argument is stupid as it makes anyone in the future the Jewish Messiah. \n \n \nYou debate like a child who lashes out and insists he's right and then you get mad when we ignore your infantile rants. I have your number Patrick. You are pathetic in your debating style, and like daewoo in your demands that you are right while proving nothing substantial at all. You really need to find some more honorable role models since you're still a child.\n\n \n LOl.

Says the one who denies evolution yet uses its products on a daily basis. Says the one who relies on the following list:\n \n 1) Relying on threats of Hell\n 2) Claiming everyone else is spiritually dead\n 3) Calling everyone who disagrees an bigot\n 4) Calling everyone who disagrees an atheist\n 5) Calling everyone who disagrees an philosophical coward\n 6) Calling everyone who disagrees an troll\n 7) Stop pretending that refutations of your posts don't exist\n 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes (Freaky Links anyone?)\n 9) Stop tying disagreements on your interpretation of Christanity to be an rejection of Christanity\n 10) Claiming to be an victim when you are losing\n 11) Claiming everyone is lying or distorting what you say (especially when you fail to provide evidence or meet challenges to prove this)\n 12) Claiming to be of the moral high ground when you freely embrace 1-11.\n \n \nI would rather be comical and offer some humor around here than be the example of pathetic and cynical negativity which the likes of you and penfold and your ilk represent at every turn on these forums.\n\n \n If that was true, why are we all laughing at you?",

Agrees Gerald Schubert of the University of California--Los Angeles Department of Earth and Space Sciences: \"As far as the code goes, Baumgardner is a world-class scientist.\" Baumgardner the Christian is well known in Los Alamos. Most people shake their heads wryly or with open irritation at the mention of his name. Abe Jacobson, an atmospheric scientist, says Baumgardner is \"known here in the Los Alamos community as a Christian rabble-rouser.\n \n My wife is a schoolteacher here, and Baumgardner regularly takes issue with the teaching of evolution in the public schools, but personally he is nice enough.\" Baumgardner the scientist, however, is accepted completely among scientists, perhaps because he so easily maintains what Jacobson calls his \"disconnect.\" He does not push his religious views on his colleagues. \"I've never become personally involved in these issues,\" says Hager. \"I avoid discussing the topic with John.\" In Los Alamos, Baumgardner, his wife, Jean, and their daughter regularly attend Calvary Chapel, which sits atop a mesa over the Rio Grande. Most members of the church believe, as Baumgardner does, that God created the river around 6,000 years ago. Terra can prove this for them. Or it can prove that the ancestral Rio Grande flowed massively across this plain in the late Tertiary Period, between 2 and 5 million years ago. One can look down at the river from Calvary Chapel's mesa and believe whatever one wants to about it. Belief does not need the blessing of science. But to John Baumgardner both a Christian and a scientist, apparently it does.\n \n And why did you ignore the other links I posted which answer your question more completely?",

   "And let's not forget this link: Flood Stories from Around the World  Maybe someone will now answer my question as to why so many diverse cultures and people had so many common themes to their own flood traditions before world wide communication was even possible.\n\n I wonder, Arch, if you actually read through some of them to actually claim this \"so many common themes\" bunk.\n \n Let's look at a few, just to see what deception you are up to with providing this source with your claims (copied from the source you gave).\n \n Gunwinggu (northern Arnhem Land):\n The woman Gulbin traveled from the south, looking for a place to put herself as djang. At length, she killed a snake, began cooking it, and slept while it cooked. But the snake was the daughter of She who lives underground. That snake made water rise, threatening to drown the woman, and at last the Snake came up and ate her. Later the Snake vomited her bones, which became like rock. [Berndt & Berndt, pp. 84-85]\n \n Two girls traveled, making places. With fires, they attracted two men to marry them. But one day the four of them killed the daughter of Ngalyod, the Rainbow Snake. The mother came looking for her child, and they saw storm and rushing water coming. They tried to escape by climbing rocks, but the water rose and drowned them. The Snake ate them, carried their bones for a long time, and vomited them out in the same place, named Malbaid. They became like rocks. [Berndt & Berndt, pp. 279-280]\n \n The first people were living in what is now the middle of the sea. In ignorance, some of them knocked a maar rock, a dangerous Dreaming rock. After they went home, rain fell for a long time, and fresh water came running in search of them. In panic, the people swam around trying to get to dry land. There was no place they could go except for the rock Aragaladi, but Aragaladi was not a real rock; Snake had made it rise up for them. Snake came looking for the people, urinating salt water. A man came from the mainland in a canoe, but he drowned in the middle of the sea. Snake came and swallowed the people and later vomited their bones. She made the place deep with sea water. Those first people became rocks. Nobody goes to Aragaladi now. \n \n Hm. no Ark, no one survives, everyone climbs onto a rock and is then eaten by a Snake that urinates salt water! And then the Snake vomits out their bones and they become rocks! \n \n Sound's just like Noah!\n -\n -\n Gumaidj (Arnhem Land):\n When a storm came up, two sisters who were gathering shellfish swore at Namarangini, the spirit man who sang up the rain. He heard, grabbed the younger sister, and tried unsuccessfully to copulate with her while the older sister beat him with a branch. He took her to the hut at his camp, made a fire, and tried again, but he discovered there was a cycad nut grinding stone in her vagina. He removed it with her stick for beating cycad nuts, and then he copulated with her easily. When they had finished, she made herself into a fly and returned to her husband. Her husband discovered the stone was missing, and he killed her by pushing a heated stick through her vagina into her stomach. The next morning, the other sister discovered that she was dead and knew that her husband had killed her. The Fly and Sandfly women cried for their sister and beat her husband, driving him away. He died and turned into a certain milkwood tree. When the women cried, rain fell heavily and continued falling for several weeks. They made bark rafts. A rush of water from inland washed them out to sea, to Elcho and other islands. At sea, you can still hear them crying. Women lost their grinding stones from their vagina when the flood washed them out to sea. [Berndt & Berndt, pp. 287-289]\n \n So, first, where does it say this is a worldwide flood? Second, I don't recall any Grinding Stones in vaginas in Noah's tale, nor people turning into flies or milkwood trees.\n \n -\n -\n Manger (Arnhem Land):Crow got into an argument with two other men because he accidentally let green ants contaminate their fish. They took back their fish, and Crow took back the goose eggs he had brought. They fought. Crow defeated them and left saying they'd fight again. Crow went to his mother's tribe. When the other two men appeared, the tribe put on a ceremony rather than quarrelling more. When everyone else had fallen asleep, Crow climbed a tree and chopped off a branch, which fell and killed the two men. Then he poured out a bag of honey which came down so heavily it flooded the area. All the people turned into birds. \n \n This one doesn't even have WATER (nor is the flood of honey worldwide)! OR AN ARK!!!!!! And last I checked, people didn't turn into birds in Noah's tale!\n \n This one has absolutely nothing in common with Noah's story, and yet your source hocks it as being similar.\n \n I'll note that several other Australian ones on there came AFTER christianity came to the area in recent times!\n \n -\n -\n Then we have:\n Hawaii:Lalohona, a woman from the depths of the sea, was enticed ashore by Konikonia with a series of images. She warned him that her parents, Kahinalii and Hinakaalualumoana, would cause the ocean to flood the land so that her brothers, the pao'o fish, may search for her. At her suggestion, they fled to the mountains and built their home in the tops of the tallest trees. After ten days, Kahinalii sent the ocean; it rose and overwhelmed the land. The people fled to the mountains, and the flood covered the mountains; they climbed the trees, and the flood rose above the trees and drowned them all. But the waters began to subside just as they reached the door of Konikonia's house. When the waters retreated, he and his people returned to their land. This flood is called kai-a-ka-hina-lii. \n \n Yeah, that shows Noah's Ark! Wait - there was no ark there! But they must still be similar! emoticon_rolleyes\n \n -\n -\n Maidu (central California):\n As the Indians of old lived tranquilly in the Sacramento Valley, a mighty rushing of waters came suddenly, so that the whole valley became like an ocean. Many Indians were overtaken by the waters, and the frogs and the salmon overtook and ate many others. Only two escaped to the hills, but the Great Man made them fruitful, so the world was soon repopulated with many tribes. One man was a chief of great renown over all the nations. He went to a knoll overlooking the waters that covered the fertile plains of his ancestors. For nine sleeps he lay there without food, meditating on how that water had come there. At the end of nine sleeps, he was changed so that no arrow could harm him. He commanded the Great Man to let the waters flow from the plains. The Great Man opened the side of a mountain, and the waters flowed away to the ocean.\n \n So, a flood occurs in Sacramento Valley (don't think the world is contained in that valley). People get eaten by salmon and frogs(lol). Two people run to the hills to survive. The side of a mountain is opened to drain the waters in the valley.\n \n Sound's EXACTLY like Noah's flood!!!!!\n \n -\n -\n Shasta (northern California interior):\n Coyote encountered an evil water spirit who said, \"There is no wood\" and caused water to rise until it covered Coyote. After the water receded, Coyote shot the water spirit with a bow and ran away, but the water followed him. He ran to the top of Mount Shasta; the water followed but didn't quite reach the top. Coyote made a fire, and all the other animal people swam to it and found refuge there. After the water receded, they came down, made new homes, and became the ancestors of all the animal people today.\n \n So. Coyote fights with a water spirit, shoots it, and runs to Mount shasta, which the waters can't reach (funny, I thought \"Every hill\" was covered.......), and then people swam to a fire that he starts on the mountain.\n \n Sound's JUST like Noah!!!!!!\n \n That's all I really have time for now, and that was just a cursory search.\n \n You should really rethink your source there, bud............",

It won't convince either of us.\n \n \n \n \nNo again Brigid, radical islam doesn't mourn for anyone who disagrees with their satanic gospel.

That you would compare born again believers to them shows how utterly blind you are to any true spiritual truth at all. Just more reasons to mourn your spiritual condition.\n Funny how you pull this radical Islam out of your arse when I mentioned no such thing. If you're really interested, though, go to a site called CARM to the forums there. There I have met up with a number of radical Christians who don't mourn for anyone either. They delight in the fact that the 'wicked atheists', etc. are going to be tortured forever.\n \n Seems there is not much difference between the radicals of either religion.\n \n \n \n\n Your delusions are seriously deep if you actually believe that Hades has any real resemblance to what your pagan myths and lies claim. \n Erm, my beliefs as a Wiccan have nothing to do with Hades, dude!\n \n I am merely stating what the GREEKS believed about their Hades (as I mentioned in the first post -\"what if the Greeks were right\"). And what I stated is what they believed. Got a problem with it, take it up with the ancient Greeks!\n \n \n \nBut I wont debate the foolishness you believe as I'm not even familiar with the source for your beliefs. \n\n \n It's called Wicca.\n \n \nI will only say that the more convinced you are in these lies you promote, the more shocked you will certainly be in that final day when you leave this world for the other side of the veil.\n\n But I'm not promoting it nor do I believe in it. I am simply stating common knowledge of the Greek beliefs. I already told you in another post my own beliefs as a Wiccan.\n \n \n\n Because I have experienced His love and kindness which indwells me every second of my life in the person of His Holy Spirit. \n And how do you know that is not your Satan decieving you in the most ironic way possible: Making you believe in someone that will end up being him, while the true God is really sitting back and seeing who is smart enough to figure it out?\n \n You have no way of knowing this.\n \n \nI know because I am constantly convicted of sins which you wouldn't even acknowledge as sins at all. \n\n I don't acknowledge \"sins\". I do acknowledge malevolent and harmful actions, and follow a very simple moral code (that is even more incentive than my own disgust at malevolent actions to not commit them), expressed in two ways.\n \n The first is I beleive and follow the Wiccan Rede (similar to your Christian Golden Rule) which states: \"An' it harm none, do what ye will\". Following this, I do (or at least try my hardest to do) things which will not cause harm to anyone. ANd if ins some way I DO bring harm to someone, I make amends and OWN UP to my actions.\n \n The second part is the Law of Threefold Return, stated in the Rede: \"Mind the Threefold Law ye should, Three times bad and three times good.\"\n So if I DO harm someone, I get that revisited on me threefold.\n \n \n\n And because acts which you promote as right and normal are so abhorrent to the spirit which resides in believers as to disgust us.

Perhaps he's afraid of people no longer worshipping him........\n \n In any case, I could care less if your God thinks I'm abhorrent or the best thing since sliced bread.

But what you all fail to understand or recognize is that your lack of belief in the true and only Creator of all that was, is and ever will be means nothing when all is said and done. You will still stand before Him one day and beg Him to forgive your blind and willful ignorance as you so boldly denied Him throughout your wasted life. You will all attempt to make excuses for why you attacked, condemned and mocked all of the people like me He sent to you who spoke of His love, and attempted to get you to look inside yourself for Him based on our promises that He is there knocking on the door of your heart if you will only seek Him sincerely. \n \n These truths are all self evident and will haunt you for all of eternity in a place too harsh to describe in human terms. Whether you believe them or not these warnings are true and real and worthy of serious consideration since they will one day prove to have been the most important decisions of your life and you blew it on all counts if you die apart from the Holy Messiah who gave His life so that you might live a more abundant life. \n \n So now you and your atheist cohorts can come back at me with your usual condemnations, but all I am doing here is attempting to get you to seek a deeper truth than any of us can achieve on our own while you have the opportunity to fellowship with the God who created you in His image for precisely that purpose.

   "There's all kinds of problems with your examples and your depiction of the Messiah, the genealogy of Jesus, etc. Your example above is not even universally shared by other Jews. For instance:\n \n \"We find rabbinic sources which also agree that God reversed the curse on Jeconiah, which they attribute to repentance on Jeconiah's part. We even find the idea that the Messiah will descend from Jeconiah--exactly the opposite of what some say is impossible! Some of these sources are as follows:\" \n \n Jewish Encyclopedia \n \n Jehoiachin's sad experiences changed his nature entirely, and as he repented of the sins which he had committed as king he was pardoned by God, who revoked the decree to the effect that none of his descendants should ever become king (Jer. xxii.30; Pesik., ed. Buber, xxv. 163a, b): he even became the ancestor of the Messiah (Tan., Toledot, 20 [ed. Buber, i. 140]). --Louis Ginzberg, \"Jehoiachin,\" vol. 7 p. 84. \n \n Rabbi A. J. Rosenberg on Jeremiah 22:24 (20th c.) \n \n Malbim calls to our attention that in the prophecy of Haggai (2:23), God says, \"On that day I will take you, Zerubbabel, and I will make you like a signet,\" for the King Messiah will be like a signet ring on God's right hand, so to speak. Just as the name of the owner of the ring is engraved on his signet ring, through which he makes himself known, so will God's name be known in the world through the King Messiah, through whom His miracles will be known. He says here that, though, in the future, Coniah will be the signet on My right hand, for the Messiah will spring from his seed, now I will remove him from there. --Ibid., p. 183. Malbim is an acronym for Meir Loeb ben Jehiel Michale, a 19th c. rabbi and commentator. 22:24. \n \n Encyclopedia Judaica \n \n Even the decree that none of his descendants would ascend the throne (Jer. 22:30) was repealed when Zerubbabel was appointed leader of the returned exiles (cf. Sanh. 37b-38a). --\"Jehoiachin\" (9:1319). \n \n Rabbi A. J. Rosenberg, on Jeremiah 22:30 (20th c.) \n \n In this, too, no man of his seed shall prosper, namely that no one will occupy the throne of David nor rule in Judah. Although we find that Zerubbabel, his great grandson, did rule over Judah upon the return of the exiles, the Rabbis (Pesikta d'Rav Kahana p. 163a) state that this was because Jehoiachin repented while in prison. They state further: Repentance is great, for it nullifies a person's sentence, as it is stated: 'Inscribe this man childless.' But since he repented, his sentence was revoked and turned to the good, and he said to him, \"I will take you, Zerubbabel, and I will make you a signet\" (Haggai 2:23). They state further: Said Rabbi Johanan: Exile expiates all sins, as it is said: \"Inscribe this man childless,\" and after he was exiled, it is written: '(1 Chron. 3:17) And the sons of Jeconiah, Assir, Shealtiel his son'--[Redak]. --A. J. Rosenberg, Jeremiah: A New English Translation (New York: Judaica Press, 1985), vol. 1 p. 185. \"Redak\" is an acronym for Rabbi David Kimchi (13th c.), whose opinion Rosenberg cites. The Problem of the Curse on Jeconiah in Relation to the Genealogy of Jesus - http://www.jewsforjesus.org/answers/prophecy/jeconiah/\n \n Second, it's not a biological son of Jeconiah, or of Solomon who is going to be the Messiah, but God / the Son of God (Jeremiah 23:5-6, Isaiah 9:6-7, Psalm 2, etc.).  This is confirmed in Matthew, that that which was conceived in Mary is of the Holy Spirit (God - Matthew 28:19; Acts 5, etc.).\n \n You say: \"According to the Bible, the Messiah must be a descendent of David through his son Solomon (II Sam. 7:14;...)\" \n \n That's highly debatable also:\n \n Note carefully the language used about Solomon: \"I will establish his kingdom...I will establish his throne forever....I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever\" (1 Chronicles 17). \n \n There was, however, a divine condition clearly laid out: \"I will establish his kingdom forever IF he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws, as is being done at this time\" (1 Chronicles 28:7). Was Solomon unswerving in carrying out God's commands and laws? Hardly!  The scriptural record is very clear:\n \n From 1 Kings 11:1-8 - \n \n 1 King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughter-Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites. 2 They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, \"You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.\" Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love. 3 He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. 4 As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been. 5 He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech [a] the detestable god of the Ammonites. 6 So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not follow the LORD completely, as David his father had done. \n \n 7 On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites. 8 He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods. \n \n From 1 Kings 11:9-13\n \n 9 The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD's command. 11 So the LORD said to Solomon, \"Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates. 12 Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son. 13 Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.\" \n \n Solomon did not meet God's conditions, and his throne was not established forever. It is the Throne of David's which was to meet the condition. (Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus, Vol. 4, pages 90-91)\n\n \n Sorry I got busy with work and school and wasn't able to get back here until now. I didn't want you to think I had given up, so in response\n \n You can't take a Jew get them to believe in Christianity and still claim they are Jewish. Give something from Jews who don't believe Jesus was the Messiah to support your claims and we'll talk.\n \n \n One of the fundamental points about the Messiah is that he must be descended from the House of David, and not only from the House of David, but a certain branch of the House of David. This presents great problems for Jesus being the the Messiah.\n Christians believe that Jesus was born of a virgin birth, he had no father. As we all know lineage is paternal we see this clearly in Number 1:2\n \"Take a census of all the congregation of the people of Israel, by families, by fathers' houses, according to the number of names, every male, head by head\" (see also Number 1:18).\n Therefore it is hard to see how Jesus could be from the House of David as he has no father. Christians answer that his lineage is through Joseph. Even if somehow we accepted that lineage could travel through\n a NON-BIOLIGICAL parent, it wouldn't help as the purported lineage of Joseph is not from the right(Messianic) branch of King David. In Matthew, Joseph's lineage is presented as going through Jeconiah. However Jeremiah clearly states that Jeconiah was cursed and none of his descendents would asend to the throne.\n The curse effectively removes Joseph, a direct descendant of Jeconiah, from ever being a claimant to the royal throne. Jesus couldn't possibly inherit the throne from him, even if we ascribe Joseph's lineage to Jesus.\n Even more interesting, is that Luke gives a different genealogy where Joseph is descended from Heli. Some Christians try to answer by saying that Luke is describing Mary's lineage. However, there is no support for the notion that it is Mary's line. Besides, it is irrelevant, because lineage is paternal. Luke's genealogy presents a different problem as well, as the lineage goes from David to Nathan (not Solomon). However the Bible clearly states that the Messiah would descend from Solomon:\n 1 Chron 22:9-10\n 9.Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace, for I will give him peace from all his enemies, for his name shall be Solomon...\n 10.He shall build the HOUSE for my name, and he shall be my son, and I will be his father, and I WILL establish the throne of HIS kingdom over Israel FOREVER.\n Again this lineage (not through Solomon)effectively removes Joseph, from ever being a claimant to the royal throne as God states that he established Solomon and his descendents on the throne forever. Therefore, Jesus couldn't possibly inherit the throne from Joseph, even if we ascribe Joseph's lineage to Jesus.\n \n To sum up, we have the following problems with Jesus being the Messiah:\n 1) If Jesus had no father(virgin birth) then he is not from the House of David\n 2) Even if we allow Jesus to use the lineage of Joseph (his non-bioligical father) the lineage in Matthew goes through the cursed branch of Jeconiah and therefore cannot be the Messiah and the lineage in Luke is not through Solomon.\n 3) The lineages in the NT conflict\n \n I have responses to what are the typical arguments below.\n \n He's still of the House of David by blood through Mary. Geneology is traced throught the father, but you can still be of a given house through the mother\n \n Also, by being the adpoted son of Joseph, he gets the legal rights as well. He avoids the curse of Jeconiah by not beeing of his seed, but still gets the legal lineage to David through Jeseph and the blood relation to David through Mary\n \n It is a yes or no question, if genealogoy is traced through the father then the mother is out. The OT clearly states that genealogy is based solely on the father.The point about Jews tracing lineage through the mother is incorrect. For someone to be Jewish their mother needs to be Jewish. However, their lineage is through the father only. This is the way Judaism has always been (this is recorded in the Talmud). \n \n While the inheritance of physical posessions would be valid from the Jewish standpoint, unfortunately it wouldn't work for inheriting the status of a Kohen or a king. The reason for that is that blood lineage is treated differently than transference of physical property in the Jewish law, and requires without exception an uninterrupted bloodline. Jesus would therefore have no problem inheriting a house and posessions from Joseph, but he would need to be from the PHYSICAL lineage of David and Solomon to qualify for the kingdom. \n \n There are two problems here. The first is there is no basis for 1st century Jews to go around adopting children and even if we say ok he was adopted he would not get the benefit as if he were born of Joseph. \n \n Even ignoring the obvious problem that lineage is only paternal, neither genealogy is fit for the Messiah (Joseph's because of the curse and Mary's because it is not from Solomon) Therefore 0 + 0 = 0. How does it help that Mary's line avoids the curse, Mary's line still can't be the Messiah because it is not descended from Solomon. The bottom line is that Joseph was descended from Jeconiah who was cursed and Mary was not descended from Solomon making neither of them nor their descendents fit to be the Messiah.",

   "\n To sum up, we have the following problems with Jesus being the Messiah:\n 1) If Jesus had no father(virgin birth) then he is not from the House of David\n 2) Even if we allow Jesus to use the lineage of Joseph (his non-bioligical father) the lineage in Matthew goes through the cursed branch of Jeconiah and therefore cannot be the Messiah and the lineage in Luke is not through Solomon.\n 3) The lineages in the NT conflict.\n\n \n See, a lot of your Jewish misconceptions occur because you still don't get it that the Messiah is to be God (Jeremiah 23:5-6; Psalm 2 Isaiah 9:6-7). \n \n Here's just one example of where even a number of Jewish Rabbis believed the Messiah would be divine:\n \n Jeremiah 23:5-6 Shows That the Messiah Was to be God Himself\n \n Buried within the pages of the book of Jeremiah lies one of the most precious and revealing prophecies of the Messiah to be found within the bounds of the Hebrew scriptures. In it, we see revealed that the Messiah, the Branch whom God was going to raise to fill the throne of David, would be given the name of the LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, YHWH Tsidqenu (Wnq@d+x! hw*hy!). As we will see below, this phraseology points us to the divine nature of the Messiah, specifically that He was to be YHWH Himself. Below, this shall be briefly explored, and some of the more common Jewish objections to this proposition will be examined.\n \n Let us look at the passage in question,\n \n \"Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD (JEHOVAH) OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.\" (Jeremiah 23:5-6)\n \n From what is said in this passage, we see that this portion is specifically Messianic in content. This is seen both from the term \"Branch\" (tsemach - jm^x#), and from the Davidic ancestry of the King who was to be raised up.\n \n The name \"Branch\" is almost universally accepted as Messianic, both by Jews and Christians alike. This term is a metaphor, literally meaning \"shoot\" or \"sprout\", and signifies the new life that Messiah was to bring to the Davidic monarchy, which was presumed dead. Further, the implications of the name were that Messiah would bring new life to all mankind, not just to His people Israel. This description as \"Branch\" appears several times in the Hebrew scriptures. It appears in Isaiah 4:2, where the Messiah's presence in the coming Kingdom is described as \"beautiful\" and \"glorious\". In Isaiah 11:1, the Branch is said to come from the \"stem of Jesse\", and is filled with the Spirit of God. In Jeremiah 33:15, the Branch again is said to come from the royal line of David. Yet, this same Branch from the royal line is termed God's servant in Zechariah 3:8, and is described as a man who will carry out God's work in Zechariah 6:12.\n \n The rabbis recognised that Branch was a name for the Messiah. R. Y'hoshu'a notes this as a name for Messiah from Zechariah 6:121. Rav Huna also refers to this as a Messianic name2, with Buber concurring in his commentary notes on that statement3.\n \n Likewise, the instances in Jewish rabbinical literature in which the Messiah is explicitly understood to be descended from David are too numerous to list more than a sampling here. Moses Maimonides pointed to the statements of Numbers 24:17 when he wrote,\n \n \"And there he says: 'I see him but not now', this refers to David; 'I behold him but not nigh', this refers to King Messiah; 'A star shall step forth out of Jacob', this refers to David; 'and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel', this refers to King Messiah.\"4\n \n Rav Y'huda taught that the Messiah would be \"another David\", and that the Messiah and the first David would rule as King and viceroy, respectively5. The Aramaic Targum of Jonathan b. Uzziel likewise interprets Jeremiah 23:5 specifically in the sense of the Messiah's descent from David, even translating \"branch\" as \"Messiah\"6. Levey notes that in his Targum, Jonathan expands the name \"LORD our righteousness\" to read \"may vindication be accomplished for us by the Lord in His day\", a paraphrasical explanation of \"YHWH Tsidkenu\" which the commentator felt impelled to explain because of the Messianic idea contained in the verse7. Thus, the interpretation of Jeremiah 23:5-6 as Messianic would seem to rest on a solid Biblical foundation, and is also supported by the understanding of Jewish traditional theology.\n \n Most interesting to our point here is that many of the rabbis recognised that the Messiah would be God. R. Abba bar Kahana explicitly stated that the Messiah's name would be \"LORD (Adonai)\", and quotes Jeremiah 23:6 as evidence 8. Smith remarks that the Jewish teachers frequently interpreted this name in Jeremiah 23:6 as a personal name of the Messiah (rather than as a title for Israel or Jerusalem) in the Targumim, Midrashim, and Talmud 9. In the Peshikta Rabbah, we find the statement,\n \n \"You find that at the beginning of the creation of the world King Messiah was born [and] that he emerged in the thought [of God] even before the world was created...\"10\n \n The First Book of Enoch reiterates that the Messiah (there called the \"Son of Man\") was hidden in God from the beginning, before the creation, and even that the kings and rulers of the earth worship the Son of Man, setting their hopes in him and petitioning for mercy at his hands14, something directed appropriately only to God. Perhaps most explicitly of all is the statement found in R. Simeon b. Yochai's comments on the Zohar,\n \n \"There is a perfect Man, who is an Angel. This Angel is Metatron, the Keeper of Israel; He is a man in the image of the Holy One, blessed be He, who is an Emanation from Him; yea, He is Jehovah; of Him cannot be said, He is created, formed or made; but He is the Emanation from God. This agrees exactly with what is written, Jeremiah 23:5-6..., of David's Branch, that though He shall be a perfect man, yet He is &#8216;The Lord our Righteousness.&#8217;\"15\n \n More in the link:\n \n Jeremiah 23:5-6 - The Messiah as God\n \n As for the genealogies supposedly contradicting each other, that's never been proven. Tradition has Luke showing Mary's male ancestry. We just don't have all the records anymore so this will remain an open debate on the genealogy.",
