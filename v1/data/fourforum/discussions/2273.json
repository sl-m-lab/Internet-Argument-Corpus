   "From what I know of the New Testament of the Bible, there is very little about making large institutions of worship (aka the Church). I thought Jesus taught about values that we should live our lives by, not tithe. Doesn't having a huge corporation-like entity that governs your spiritual beliefs sort of contradict the intent of the New Testament teachings? Why do you need to attend church? Can someone explain why it is necessary to visit a place where you mechanically perform a ceremony that has no personal meaning to you (lipservice prayer), when someone could just as easily practice their beliefs at home in their own ways? I think there's actually a forbidden gospel that speaks ill of organized religion, but I can't remember the name of it. What do you think?",

   "If you eliminate all churchs and everyone quits going to them then you will probably see a reduction in the importance of religion to the average person. This would go to show that churchs are important to religion.\n\n I agree. There are more reasons:\n (1) To give one another encouragement. There are many people that believe that \"once saved, always saved\" and it tends to make them complacent. I think they shelter themselves under religion instead of God. Then again there are those that feel you can take the wrong road at any given point and wonder off from &#8220;The Way&#8221;. Those that know that a choice, any choice can land you in trouble are those that need each other for encouragement and comfort.\n (2) To learn from another&#8217;s mistake. Some churches allow members to get up and voice their opinion on subjects, thus giving those who have been there and failed or those who have yet to get in that certain place/position ideas of how to correct their mistakes. Boards like this is what I would consider a church in some ways.\n (3) To find out about their community. Newspapers and town counsels hardly ever focus on the very bad aspects of a community. Churchgoers feel a need to know in order to reach out. Some never bring up religion unless asked by those they are helping.\n (4) To form sub-ministries. A group will go to different areas, some miles away, in order to comfort the sick, the poor, prisoners, etc.\n (5) Last, but not least; to praise their God. Keeping in touch with Him is critical. Although some do go to church to show off their new vehicle or latest line of clothing, most go to show God they care.",

I think there is an assumption that everyone in organized religion is mechanically participating like a zombie. That can happen but it is not an absolute. To suggest that is to pretend to know the hearts and minds of all of those people.\n \n Furthermore, I'm not sure how knowing the meaning of something makes it unmeaningful. I'm not sure how knowing the meaning of something is a cause--effect relationship that results in a mechanical obligation.\n \n Lastly, speaking in terms of Christianity, and more specifically, Catholicism, the Catholic \"faith\" cannot be seperated from the \"religion.\" They are one and the same for the simple fact that Jesus instituted sacraments which he wanted us to carry on. The initial Christian community was also just that--a community that worshipped communally. Jesus started a church. Modern day organized Christianity is a natural result of that.",

Where in the bible does it say that you have to perform catholic sacraments to achieve salvation? the sacraments were instituted hundreds of years after Jesus's supposed ascension by papal coucils, not Jesus himself.\n\n Here is a brief explanation. (There is much more Holy Scripture and Holy Tradition (and history) to substantiate this).\n \n Eucharist instituted by Christ:\n Luke 22:17-19  \"And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, 'Take this, and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine utnil the kingdom of God comes.' And he took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, 'This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\"\n \n Eucharist necessary for salvation:\n John 6:53  \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\"\n \n Eucharist practiced prior to declaration/further explanation of councils of the Church:\n Acts 2:42  \"And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread   and the prayers.\"\n \n Acts 20:7 \"On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread...\"\n \n Baptism instituted by Christ:\n Matthew 28:19  \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...\"\n \n John 3:22  \"After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea; there he remained with them and baptized.\"\n \n Baptism necessary for salvation:\n John 3:5 \"Jesus answered, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.\"\n \n Baptism practiced prior to declaration of councils:\n Acts 2:37-38  \"Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, 'Brethren, what shall we do?' And Peter said to them, 'Repent, and be baptized   every one of you in the name of Jesus' Christ for the forgiveness of yours sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\"\n \n Acts 8:38  the ethiopan eunuch was baptized by Philip\n \n Confession instituted by Christ:\n John 20: 22-23  \"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.\"\n \n Confession necessary for salvation:\n 1 John 5:16  \"If any one sees his brother committing what is not a mortal sin, he will ask, and God will give him life for those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin which is mortal; I do not say that one is to pray for that. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin which is not mortal.\"\n \n James 5:19  \"My brethren, if any one among you wanders from the truth and some one brings him back, let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from the error of his way   will save his soul from death   and will cover a multitude of sins.\"\n \n Confession practiced prior to the decree of councils:\n 2 Corinthians 5:18  \"All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation...\n \n James 5:16  \"Therefore, confess your sins to one another...\"\n \n By the way, are there any other sacraments besides Catholic sacraments?",

   "From what I know of the New Testament of the Bible, there is very little about making large institutions of worship (aka the Church). I thought Jesus taught about values that we should live our lives by, not tithe. Doesn't having a huge corporation-like entity that governs your spiritual beliefs sort of contradict the intent of the New Testament teachings? Why do you need to attend church? Can someone explain why it is necessary to visit a place where you mechanically perform a ceremony that has no personal meaning to you (lipservice prayer), when someone could just as easily practice their beliefs at home in their own ways? I think there's actually a forbidden gospel that speaks ill of organized religion, but I can't remember the name of it. What do you think?\n\n \n I have only read part of the replies on this board due to my time constraints but here is my stab at this. \n \n The church was established by Jesus. Not necessarily a hierarchy of people. He confered leadership in a group he called elders. The conferred authority in a group called deacons. The reason for eldership was a plurality of leadership so that none would be more important than the others, so that the needs of people could be met through giving and so that people could be taught about the kingdom of God. The reason for the deacons is because the practical needs of the people became far too numerous for the elders to meet them. \n \n Somewhere around the 3rd or fourth century the church started developing written doctrine and slowly moved leadership to a single person. The written doctrine was in response to a group of individuals that were teaching things then considered to be herasy. They felt the need to outline what was correct and what was not so as to know who to trust. There was a LOT of persecution of the early church (people thrown to lions, beheaded, etc for not worshipping Roman Gods). Who to trust was a crucial item.\n \n The singularity of leadership was so as to establish a final authority as to what was appropriate doctrine. This is where the church blew it in my mind. Jesus never intended his church to have a single person in authority. He conferred authority to a group. (this is my opinion and the roman catholic church has a different opinion).\n \n People meet in groups so as to understand and meet the needs of the group. The new testament clearly states that the members of the body were given different gifts for the purpose of meeting the needs of the body. They are clearly compared to a body where it says that a foot or hand or ear or eye are all part of one body and all are necessary.\n \n A side note, In earlier days, news was given so that the needs of people could be met. You received the news of things you could do something about (so and so's barn burneed last night, lets take over some clothes and food to help or help rebuild etc). Now we are inundated with information that we can do nothing about. It is a significant distraction that enables us to live completely self contained and selfishly. The problem is some of the church has given in to this and are distracted to the point of no longer meeting needs but instead grabbing numbers.\n \n Anyway, more than you asked for, but I look forward to hearing what you think.",

   "The question is \"Is organized religion a good idea\"?\n \n Well it depends on the affects of such an orginization. For instance while I may have extremely large problems with the doctrine and some of the beliefs of Christianity, Christianity as an organized religion often has good affects. In some cases such an orginization of Chrisitans produces homeless shelters, community projects, and charity.\n \n \n Now I do not recognize Islam has an extremist religion but in cases of organized Islam (this also applys to other religions) it can lead to negative affects. These include the degrading of women, propoganda, dictatorships, and terrorism.\n \n I do not mean to pick on any religion in paticular. I recognize that the religions I have listed as well as many others have both postive and negative affects as well as moderates and extremists.\n \n Now as another negative affect of organized religion I believe that in many caes it leads to conversion of dependent minds for emotional and pyscologial reasons. Such is the process of brainwashing, which I find to be a negative affect.\n \n \n - Again the notion that \"organized religion\" is a good idea rests completely upon such an orginization would have.",

It is good to be debating with you again. \n \n I have considered what you say. HOwever the written doctrine did not start coalescing until the 3rd or 4th century AD. Also, I see nothing in the verses that you quoted which indicate Peter is the SOLE leader, only that he should be shepherding. There is not one shepherd for many flocks. There are many. As I stated in my earlier post, my reading of the bible shows that the leadership of the church was conferred in a plurality of leaders. The Bishop only started to show up in the latter days of the beginning of the church. There are indications that were a plurality until such time as certain influential individuals began writing about the need to develop doctrine. At the time there was a great deal of persecution of the church and there were many false prophets at the time. MANY. In order to protect themselves they began writing doctrine so that all the various churches would know and agree on various things. \n \n I think the didache is one of the documents that begins to show the change concerning the idea of baptism. I am aware that the roman catholic church uses sprinkling as do some protestant denominations. The didache I believe outlines first living (running water) should be used if available to baptize those that believe (immediately by the way). If that is not available then standing water (cold), then standing water warm, the pouring water cold, then warm, and finally sprinkling if only a little bit or it is impractical. \n \n I am currently taking a class on ancient church history and am learning a great deal and can see the progression. I am reading things written by Origin and Pliny the younger, and others. It is quite fascinating. Until well after 300 years after Christs death it was widely accepted that there were to be a plurality of leaders in the church. The apostles themselves accepted this. Paul even contended with Peter on one occasion in scripture. Peter's will did not stand as final and none of the other apostles recognize that ever.",

Doctrine does develop from the Revelation of God. This does not mean that it changes altogether. Its meaning is sometimes more fully comprehended and extended with time. \n \n \nThe persecutions caused the writing of doctrine. They are what caused various men to define what doctrine was so as to prevent the imposters from gaining headway. That is mostly what I was talking about.\n\n I agree with you again. Much of what the Church held as Tradition was not formally defined (written down) until heresy challenged it. Everyone accepted initially, then it is challenged with erroneous doctrines and then it is defined to destroy the false teaching and maintain the truth of the original Revelation of God.\n \n \nAs for acts chapter 11 verse 18, I am uncertain the will part.

(Actually God did through Peter) Read Acts 15:7 \"...God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel.\" Now, I do not deny that the behavior of Peter was wrong and that is what Paul reprimanded him own. The behavior of other hopes has also been bad but they are all men prone to sin. Their teaching in the capacity of the Church is without error though.\n \n \nWe have debated this before, but I have gained a little more education. I look forward to your response.

But he intended that hierarchy to have a leader just as God has always appointed a father to lead his people since Old Testament times. But has it occurred you that even if your theory on the hierarchy stands, then that hierarchy is found in the Catholic Church, the one descended from Jesus' hierarchy, the apostles. (The Church recognizes the authority of all bishops throughout the world by the way.)\n \n \n I agree with most of what you say. The Didache is often cited by Catholics. Doctrine does develop from the Revelation of God. This does not mean that it changes altogether. Its meaning is sometimes more fully comprehended and extended with time. \n \n \n I agree with you again. Much of what the Church held as Tradition was not formally defined (written down) until heresy challenged it. Everyone accepted initially, then it is challenged with erroneous doctrines and then it is defined to destroy the false teaching and maintain the truth of the original Revelation of God.\n \n \n Are you sure Peter did not come up with it? (Actually God did through Peter) Read Acts 15:7 \"...God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel.\" Now, I do not deny that the behavior of Peter was wrong and that is what Paul reprimanded him own. The behavior of other hopes has also been bad but they are all men prone to sin. Their teaching in the capacity of the Church is without error though.\n \n \n All is well on my side. Except for my dad experiencing an illness but he is recovering very nicely.\n\n \n Maximus: Peace and Grace to you. I do not believe that Jesus intended his flock to be splintered. I do believe that it is an act of God that the flock was splintered due to some of the shepherds feeding on the sheep. God did not always provide a shepherd. God originally had himself as the head of the tribes of Israel. The prophets did not shepherd according to the same sense we use the word today. They merely related the word of God as He spoke it to them. God never intended for His people to be led by anybody but himself. He did not intend for a singular leader. He appointed groups of leaders in the new testament. They were to be in submission to Jesus Christ not one human being. We see clearly the results of one human running things. It was not the collective leadership that lead to the splintering of the flock, but rather the abuses of the one leader. This is very clear in the reformation. However it is also seen clearly in the early church, especially where Arianism is concerned. It was one individual that attacked the doctrine of Jesus being fully God and full man. However, we see that the doctrine was cared for in the plurality at the council of Nicea.\n \n The desire for multiple leaders is not what has caused the division. You put the cart before the horse. The division has resulted in many singular leaders, each going their own way. Individual leaders, never intended by God, is what caused the mess. The mess is the result not the cause.\n \n We see God's intention that He be at the head when the children of Israel requested a king for their own because until that point they were lead by God alone. So the children of Israel selected Saul, because he was beautiful and strong. He promptly dumped God in favor of himself. (This is human nature). God then chose a man after his own heart, not because he thought they should have a singular leader, but because he allowed it. God often allows us to choose that which is not best. \n \n As to Peter and Paul, Peter did indeed have one of the first gentile converts, but then slipped in his own sin and accepted the instruction of the judaizers. Paul repudiated him. It is this interdependence of multiple leaders that has kept any semblence of purity in the church. Imagine if Peter were the head dog, then Pauls, rebuke would have meant nothing and we would require people to be circumsized, and to not eat with unclean to this day. Or more likely, chrisitanity would have disappeared all together. \n \n Thanks again for the renewed debate.",

He did not intend for a singular leader. \n\n What do you think of the roles of Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, the judges, Saul, David, and Solomon? The pope also relates the word of God as He spoke it in the Revelation of Jesus and as he now speaks it. The pope is a messenger.\n \n \nHe appointed groups of leaders in the new testament. They were to be in submission to Jesus Christ not one human being. \n \n In what Church does this group of leaders reside historically?\n \n \nWe see clearly the results of one human running things. It was not the collective leadership that lead to the splintering of the flock, but rather the abuses of the one leader. This is very clear in the reformation. \n \n There are many things clear about the reformation. There were abuses in the Church that needed reforming. These abuses did not require that Luther break from the Church to start his own church, splintering the one Christ started. These abuses did not require the invention of new doctrine that had not been present for 1500 years. \n \n \nThe desire for multiple leaders is not what has caused the division. You put the cart before the horse. The division has resulted in many singular leaders, each going their own way. Individual leaders, never intended by God, is what caused the mess. The mess is the result not the cause.\n\n Multiple leaders is not the problem. That is why the Church has bishops throughout the world who have teaching authority. However, the bishops must be in unison. The pope maintains that unity.\n \n \nAs to Peter and Paul, Peter did indeed have one of the first gentile converts, but then slipped in his own sin and accepted the instruction of the judaizers. Paul repudiated him. It is this interdependence of multiple leaders that has kept any semblence of purity in the church. Imagine if Peter were the head dog, then Pauls, rebuke would have meant nothing and we would require people to be circumsized, and to not eat with unclean to this day. Or more likely, chrisitanity would have disappeared all together. \n \n I think the scriptures concerning Peter's evangelization of Gentiles in Acts 11 and 15 tells us that your scenario above would not have come about. Peter was at fault in behavior but not in teaching.\n \n Peace.",

   "From what I know of the New Testament of the Bible, there is very little about making large institutions of worship (aka the Church). I thought Jesus taught about values that we should live our lives by, not tithe. Doesn't having a huge corporation-like entity that governs your spiritual beliefs sort of contradict the intent of the New Testament teachings? Why do you need to attend church? Can someone explain why it is necessary to visit a place where you mechanically perform a ceremony that has no personal meaning to you (lipservice prayer), when someone could just as easily practice their beliefs at home in their own ways? I think there's actually a forbidden gospel that speaks ill of organized religion, but I can't remember the name of it. What do you think?\n\n \n You are very correct...here is something you might of been looking for\n \n For you cross sea and land to make a single convert, and you make the new convert twice as much a child of hell as yourselves. Matthew 23:15 :) cheers!",
