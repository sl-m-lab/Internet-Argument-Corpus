   "According to Wikipedia {the free encyclopedia} \"recycling is the reprocessing of materials into new products. Recycling generally prevents the waste of potentially useful materials, reduces the consumption of raw materials and reduces energy usage, and hence greenhouse gas emissions, compared to virgin production.\" The recent discussion concerning global warming has focused primarily on alternative sources of fuel for the purpose of transportation. However, another very important pro-environment tool is recycling. The effort needs to involve more than the consumer and the government. It needs to involve those who sell {and profit} from those products that can be recycled. For example, the manufactures of bottles and cans along with the producers of what's sold inside them as well as the grocery stores that distribute them must take on a greater economic role in the process of recycling. The voluntary \"blue bag at the curb\" approach is a good start but it relies primarily on the altruism of the consumer. \n \n The question is: does the consumer bear sole responsibility for what happens to a can or bottle that contains the product used? or should some of that responsibility be borne by those who profit from its' use? Are these responsibilities being borne already and are they equitable? Some time ago bottlers would charge a five-cent \"deposit\" on a bottle to be \"refunded\" when the consumer returned the bottle. It would seem that this concept could be reoperationalized for a whole host of products. The consumer could clean the bottle or can, return it to the grocery story for a \"refund\" and the grocery store would return it to the producer then to the manufacturer etcetera each receiving a \"refund\" along the way. When all parties involved have an economic incentive to participate, recycling will make a much larger contribution towards preserving the environment.",

   "I see some problems with that approach. Many places still have a 5 cent deposit on cans and bottles; bring the can to any designated recycling area and you get your nickle back. And while some people do, many don't. I look on the curb on recycling night and there are plenty of cans and bottles. It's simply not worth people's effort to schlep a load of empty cans down to some place just to get $2.55 back. You could of course up the deposit to something meaningful, but that would hurt sales of products that come in those containers, and would be unfair to those who can't conveniently pop down to the recycling center, or who don't have room to store a bunch of empty bottles and cans.\n \n I think if you want to increase recycling you have to make it more convientient. Let people put it out with the trash once a week or two, minimize how much sorting they have to do, put recycling cans next to public trash cans. Make it easy to recycle and many people will do it; make it expensive not to recycle and you'll get alot of back pressure.",

   "We have had a bottle bill in Oregon for over 30 years and it is fairly successful. You never see littered deposit bottles. They are talking about expanding it to the ubiquitous bottled waters. (You'd think that dehydration was dangerously imminent that way some folks constantly cling to their overpriced water.) Anyway, it is a pain to take them back (perhaps if I drank less or did it more often). There are these recycling machines at the grocery stores; you chuck them in and get a slip to take to the cashier. It takes a long time. I usually pile up a shopping cart, leave it at the machine center, and go buy groceries. It is always gone by the time I return. I often just recycle them at the curb and lose the deposit another way. Occassionally I have left a separate bag of deposits bottles at the curb and those are gone by morning. \n \n You are exactly correct, however, I think the more convenient it is. The more likely people will recycle. Between the curbside recycling and the deposit bottles, and if I am energetic enough to compost veggie scraps, there is barely any trash anymore. The sorting is still too tricky and they keep changing the rules. It gets to be second nature, however. I am always shocked at other places in the country when I see folks throwing glass and plastic and newspaper in trash cans. Most of the public places have some recycling cans near trash cans. \n \n There has got to be a critical mass achieved whereby there is a market for the recycled goods. If they are cheaper to procure than virgin resources, that will tip the scales.",

   "I will say that the 5 cent deposit does have its uses. The aforementioned $2.55 isn't worth the hassle for me, but that's real money for some people. In places that don't have seperate public recycling cans the deposit is a way to see to it that someone finds it worth while to fish the can out of the trash and get it turned in. I have seen some cities that have trash cans with wire baskets on top. Trash goes in the bottom and recyclables go in the basket. The city doesn't collect the recycleables though. They're just there so that the homeless or whoever can get them easily without having to dig up all the rest of the trash and make a mess. For a one time investment of about 2 bucks per can the city gets more stuff recycled, less mess gets made, and the homeless have an easier time getting a bit more money.",
