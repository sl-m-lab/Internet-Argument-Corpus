I can't think of many situations where the canadian government would care if non-Canadian citizens were married or not, and none serious enough that they wouldn't just take your word for it. But like I said, I'm no expert on the topic. Can you supply details?",

(Opinion -- pdfexternal link)\n \n \"The issue is not about the transformation of the traditional definition of marriage, but about the unequal dispensation of benefits and privileges to one of two similarly situated classes of people,\" the court said in its 4-3 ruling.",
