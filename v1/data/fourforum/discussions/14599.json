Building that in such a place is also an insensitive act.\n\n So building a place of worship and burning a religious text are both insensitive acts? Not sure I agree with that type of logic. \n \n You probably already know that I don't really hold any religious belief. I hope you also know that I respect the right of every individual to hold their own beliefs. That is why I have supported the right to build the mosque near ground zero. I would have supported the building of any place of worship there. I do not support the burning of books, including religious texts, especially when doing so is for nothing more than provocation. Tolerance is a two way street. \n \n With that in mind, I would like to publically ammend my position on the mosque near ground zero:\n \n I no longer support the building of a mosque two blocks away from ground zero. I also no longer support the right to build any religious place of worship, regardless of denomination, within a 2 block radius of ground zero. Any existing religious structures should also be razed out of equity. \n \n \n \n'Course, as usual, the people who blow something up over their book being burned will go mostly un-condemned while the pastor burning the book will be the object of blame.\n\n \n I hold every individual responsible for their own actions. Intolerance, bigotry, and hatred are deplorable no matter who practices them, be it muslim terrorists or a chuch group in Florida. \n \n If their actions incite violence, then the blood is on their hands as well as the terrorists. Even General Petraeus has come out against it saying:\n \n \n\"Images of the burning of a Koran would undoubtedly be used by extremists in Afghanistan -- and around the world -- to inflame public opinion and incite violence,\" Petraeus said. \"Were the actual burning to take place, the safety of our soldiers and civilians would be put in jeopardy and accomplishment of the mission would be made more difficult.\" \n\n \n Yet, Terry Jones -the leader of this band of imbiciles, says this: \n \n \n\"We understand the general's concerns, we are taking those into consideration,\" Jones was quoted saying. \"We feel it's maybe the right time for America to stand up. How long are we going to bow down? How long are we going to be controlled by the terrorists, by radical Islam?\" \n\n You can only be controlled by another human being if you let them control you. I don't know about Jones and his followers, but I bow down to no man, and no man controls me. The majority of America has already stood up, and told these book burning retards to sit down. The problem being, the majority of muslims will only see that a christian American pastor is buring their sacred religious text. They will not see the fact that the majority of Americans find this pastors actions as deplorable as they do. \n \n \n\"We will not be responsible,\" Jones said. \"We are only reacting to the violence that is already there in that religion.\" -Terry Jones\n\n Ah yes, the ever popular 3rd grade \"they started it\" response. Didn't jesus say to turn the other cheek?",

   "The spiritual demonism of Terry Jones:\n \n.... Terry Jones, the man behind the action, is the pastor of the Dove World Outreach Center, a church that manages to attract a Sunday congregation of just 50 people, members of the radical fringe of the evangelical movement. ... What is less well known is that the pastor led a charismatic evangelical church, the Christian Community of Cologne, in the western German city up until 2009. Last year, however, the members of the congregation kicked founder Jones out, because of his radicalism. One of the church's current leaders, Stephan Baar, also told the German news agency DPA that there had been suspicions of financial irregularities in the church surrounding Jones.\n \n A 'climate of fear and control' had previously prevailed in the congregation, says one former member of the church who does not want to be named. Instead of free expression, 'blind obedience' was demanded, he says.\n \n Various witnesses gave SPIEGEL ONLINE consistent accounts of the Jones' behavior. The pastor and his wife apparently regarded themselves as having been appointed by God, meaning opposition was a crime against the Lord. Terry and Sylvia Jones allegedly used these methods to ask for money in an increasingly insistent manner, as well as making members of the congregation carry out work.\n \n .... Former church members are still undergoing therapy as a result of 'spiritual abuse,' Sch\u00e4fer said. According to Sch\u00e4fer, Jones urged church members to beat their children with a rod and also taught 'a distinctive demonology' and conducted brainwashing....\n\n Islamophobe's Past in Germany: Terry Jones Accused of 'Spiritual Abuse' at Cologne Church - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International",

Most people actually think it is.\n \n \n \nThat is for the people of Manhattan to decide, who seem to be in favour of the development.\n\n \n 46% according to one poll of Manhattenites with 38% opposed and 18% undecided. I am sure AZ agrees with this kind of thinking.\n \n Opposition consistently is over half of respondents oppose, the same poll when expanded to other areas of New York, was overwhelmingly opposed.\n \n \nThen it was about Muslims turning it into some shrine.\n Except they can can walk up to it already.\n\n \n Disagree, I have no problem with that, it is a very fine line that is being danced around, but if you want to argue the points then you need to grasp them or at least portray them accurately.\n \n \n \nThen its about potential propaganda on another continent.\n Americans worrying about views in another country?

The fatwa's of the ECFR's chairmain, Yussuf al-Qaradawi, are clear on how this tendency in Islam sees democracy and universal human rights:\n \n * On the separation of state and church (secularism)[citation needed]: \"Since Islam is a comprehensive system of `Ibadah (worship) and Shari'ah (legislation), the acceptance of secularism means abandonment of Shari'ah, a denial of the Divine guidance and a rejection of Allah's injunctions. (...) the call for secularism among Muslims is atheism and a rejection of Islam. Its acceptance as a basis for rule in place of Shari'ah is a downright apostasy.\" [5].[citation needed]\n \n * On equal rights for women[citation needed]: \"Those misguided people cudgel their brains in finding out lame arguments that tend to give both males and females equal shares of inheritance ... it's the nature of woman to be maintained and cared for by man ... irrespective of whether she is poor or rich.\" [5].\n \n * On democracy -where per definition a majority vote might differ from the commands in the Qur'an and Sunnah,[citation needed]: \"the Shari'ah cannot be amended to conform to changing human values and standards, rather, it is the absolute norm to which all human values and conduct must conform ...\" [6].\n \n * On the freedom of religion[citation needed]: \"All Muslim jurists agree that the apostate is to be punished. However, they differ regarding the punishment itself. The majority of them go for killing; meaning that an apostate is to be sentenced to death.\" [7].\"\n \n European Council for Fatwa and Research - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n http://snipurl.com/14af9p\n \n As for Sharia gaining in Europe\n \n Sharia's Inroads in Europe - Italian Court: 'Beaten Up for \"Her Own Good\"' :: Hudson New York\n \n <bt: The Multicultural Endgame: Sharia Law Rules Europe\n \n ISLAM - EUROPE Sharia and English law: a weakened Europe abandons humanism - Asia News\n \n Islamic groups want Germany Sharia law warns Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble - News - Bild.de\n \n The push for Sharia Law is in its infancy, but all things start small and given the numbers and control it exerts on I am glad I will be dead before it claims the world, I just feel very sad for the women of the future.

   "There's no indication he was trying to provoke violence at all by burning the book. Do you actually think Jones was out to try to incite bombings???? Get real.\n\n Violence and bombing are your words, not mine. I think Jones was well pleased that he was able to do just enough to spark a few protests and cause a few radical muslims to go on television, chant 'death to America', and burn a few flags. That way Jones can turn around and point out what irrational, evil, angry people muslims are. And meanwhile, he feasts in the spotlight. Intentional provocation, simple as that. \n \n \n \n \nBut what is the point of such an extreme comparison? There are people that let a racist epithet slip sometimes, but that doesn't mean we should put them in the same category as someone who murders a black person. The difference is so extreme that they really don't warrant being mentioned with each other, IMO. I think it's generally very poor taste to categorize taking a match to a piece of printed text with killing a bunch of people, even if both happen to be motivated by bigotry.\n\n A white guy dressed in a white robe standing on the corner shouting 'nigger' at a passing black and that same white guy walking up and shooting the passing black are both perfect examples of hate and intolerance. They are certainly not equal acts, nobody would claim them to be. You are bordering on building your own strawman with your line of argument there. The point is that they are both hateful and intolerant acts\n \n Again...you find it strange that I categorize them both as hateful intolerant acts? I believe I have stated before that I do not equate them, yet they both categorize as hate and intolerance. Categorize does not equal equate.",

So far you have brought up fear mongering which the Imam is now doing and a place for prayer. As to the this is taken from the park51 website\n \n \nFuture plans for Park51 include a world-class facility which will house a mosque. Intended to operate as a separate 501(c)(3), the mosque will be a welcoming prayer space accessible to Park51 members as well as all New Yorkers, but will be independently run.\n\n \n This in in addition to the meditation rooms. The numbers I hear are @ 1000 - 2000 people. That is not a prayer space. I will let you estimate how many sqft is necessary to hold that many people. \n \n Again believing in God doesn't mean you get to do whatever you want when you want.

   "KABUL, Afghanistan - Thousands of protesters angry over the burning of a Quran by a Florida pastor stormed a U.N. compound Friday in northern Afghanistan, killing at least 12 people, including eight foreigners. The desecration of the Muslim holy book fueled resentment against the West at a critical moment in the Afghan war.\n \n The demonstration in Mazar-i-Sharif turned violent when some protesters grabbed weapons from the U.N. guards and opened fire, then mobbed buildings and set fires on the compound, officials said. Demonstrators also massed in Kabul and the western city of Herat.\n \n The topic of Quran burning stirred outrage among millions of Muslims and others worldwide after the Rev. Terry Jones' small church, Dove Outreach Center, threatened to destroy a copy of the holy book last year. The Florida pastor had backed down but the church went through with the burning last month.\n \n -snip- \n \n Several hundred people also protested the Quran burning at several sites in Herat, a city in western Afghanistan. Protesters burned a U.S. flag at a sports stadium in Herat and chanted \"Death to the U.S.\" and \"They broke the heart of Islam.\" \n \n About 100 people also gathered at a traffic circle near the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Police directed traffic around the demonstration in the capital. One protester carried a sign that said: \"We want these bloody bastard Americans with all their forces to leave Afghanistan.\" \n \n The Gainesville, Florida church's website stated that after a five-hour trial on March 20, the Quran \"was found guilty and a copy was burned inside the building.\" A picture on the website shows a book in flames in a small portable fire pit. The church on Friday confirmed that the Quran had been burned. \n \n In a statement, Jones did not comment on whether his act had lead to the deaths. Instead he said it was time to \"hold Islam accountable\" and called on the United States and the U.N. to hold \"these countries and people accountable for what they have done as well as for any excuses they may use to promote their terrorist activities.\" \n \n Last week, Afghan President Hamid Karzai issued a statement calling the burning a \"crime against a religion.\" He denounced it as a \"disrespectful and abhorrent act\" and called on the U.S. and the United Nations to bring to justice those who burned the holy book and issue a response to Muslims around the world. \n\n \n \nIf their actions incite violence, then the blood is on their hands as well as the terrorists.\n\n \n \nThe problem being, the majority of muslims will only see that a christian American pastor is buring their sacred religious text. They will not see the fact that the majority of Americans find this pastors actions as deplorable as they do.\n\n \n \nWhen we look on TV and see a group of muslims burning our flag or protesting us (the great satan), we think 'wow, those are evil people...they simply hate us for no reason'. Wrong! People like Jones are the reason. I'm not out to prove anything to the radical muslims, and I don't feel any need to appease them or cower in fear of them. However, I think that it is important to show respect and tolerance, even in the face of our greatest enemies. We need to be mindful of the messages we send around the world. Remember that all they would see if Jones lit up a pile of Korans is a TV image of them burning. It is doubtful that they would hear the fact that the rest of America thinks that these imbiciles are ignorant bigots. Just as we never hear about the millions upon millions of muslims who don't hate the US at all. All we see are the radicals who want to kill us. We need to understand that like Jones, the radicals that want to kill us represent a small but head-turning demographic within their respective population.\n\n \n \nDoes it occur to you that if Jones had never threatened to burn the Korans, there would be nothing to react to in the first place? \n \n I condemn anyone who resorts to violence, just as I condemn ignorant, hate-inciting bigots. \n \n Hate and intolerance are still hate and intolerance, whether you are burning books or blowing up people. I have no room for either.\n\n \n ........Why?",
