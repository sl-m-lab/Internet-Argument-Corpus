   "Well, the haste of Saakashvili's announcement that acts of terrorism against the gas pipeline Mozdok-Tbilisi and power line in Karachaevo-Cherkesia were planed by Russia diversion against Georgia gives rise to doubts. Look, do you realy think Russia will be damaging its own network and then spend huge money to fix it? IMO Saakashvili's opinion is opinion of insane man. There's no logic in it Yes, this situation looks like a provocation, no doubt, but provocation from the Georgian side. And Georgian officials and Mass media reaction proves it. At first, it's Saakashvili's active reaction on the accident, which came before we got info on acts of terrorism. And Georgian journalists were so queerly fast to come to the accident place. It gives the impression that Saakashvili and Georgian journalists knew the acts of terrorism would happen in good time. I suppose this is a new proof of the I-net info about intrigues of Georgian special forces, which had been trained by US instructors in Georgia close to the Russian boarder.",
