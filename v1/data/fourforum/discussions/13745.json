   "After our HSA/TSA completely failed to stop the attempted Christmas bombing in Detroit, Napolitano stated that \"the system worked.\" That's outrageously ridiculous. The only thing that prevented hundreds from being blown out of the sky and hundreds more killed on the ground, was the bomber's poor choice of detonator. He had enough high explosive on him to blow a gaping hole in the plane. \n \n \n\n What U.S. Intelligence Knew About the Underpants Bomber \n Mark Hosenball \n If you've been wondering how alleged failed transatlantic underpants bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was able to board a plane for the U.S. after his father had warned of his terrorist sympathies, you need to understand the different databases of suspected terrorists and how they operate. The only entry in the U.S. intelligence community's principal electronic database of suspected terrorists mentioning Abdulmutallab was based on a visit by the suspect's father to the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, Nigeria, according to two U.S. national security officials. Here is a chronology of what happened:\n \n Abdulmutallab's father, wealthy Nigerian banker Dr. Alhaji Umaru Mutallab, spoke in person with officials at the embassy in the Nigerian capital on Nov. 19, said the officials, who asked for anonymity when discussing an ongoing investigation. During this meeting the senior Mutallab informed embassy officials that he was worried that his son had become involved with Islamic extremists; he specifically expressed concern that his son had either visited, or otherwise been in contact with, militants based in Yemen. Following the meeting, the officials said, the father's information was circulated within the embassy, including to representatives from U.S. intelligence agencies stationed there. The next day, Nov. 20, the embassy sent a cable to Washington, reporting what Alhaji Mutallab had said. \n \n Within days of the cable reaching Washington, the information from it was entered in TIDE, a master list of around 550,000 terrorism suspects maintained by the National Counter Terrorism Center, the national security officials told Newsweek. This office, a unit of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, was set up after the 9/11 attacks to ensure that information on terrorist suspects was rapidly shared among all relevant U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. (A detailed fact sheet on TIDE's origins and operations is posted on the Intelligence czar's Web site here) The TIDE database is the government's most comprehensive compilation of intelligence on known terrorism suspects. But, according to officials, it's also often very raw information which lacks the kind of legal substance that U.S. officials believe is required before such intelligence is used to restrict an individual's travel, for example by putting them on a \"no-fly list\" or special screening list maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center, a separate interagency unit run by the FBI.\n \n What U.S. Intelligence Knew About the Underpants Bomber - Declassified Blog - Newsweek.com\n\n \n If you read the entire article, you see how it's easy for potential terrorists to slip through this Swiss Cheese security system. If that's Napolitano's idea of a system that works, she needs to go. :xcensored",

That you might not have enough evidence to convict? Nobody says the trial has to be televised, trials in the UK are not, so you're not giving the defendant a microphone to the world's media.\n\n \n Let me give you a real world example of why it is so ludicrous to try the 9/11 terrorists, and the other terrorists who were captured on the battle fields in foreign countries in a New York Civilian Court which our insane government is planning to do. Since these enemy combatants were captured in the process of attempting to kill and murder americans and civilians in the countries they were captured in, according to the rules of war they were taken into custody as enemy combatants. According to the Geneva Convention they can legally be held in prison until the end of the war they have committed to fighting in. \n \n We all know that our war is a defensive war against these committed Jihadists who have vowed to fight until either we are dead or they are dead. They don't serve just 4 years and then resume their civilian lives like we do. So when these murderers are brought before an american court which is run according to american civilian constitutional laws, before the trial even begins the defense attorneys are going to stand up and demand that all charges against their clients be dropped immediately and they be allowed to walk out of the court to prepare their class action civil suits for illegal detention for however many years they have been held.\n \n Of course the Prosecution/Government will stand up and protest this ludicrous claim and the Judge will ask the defense attorney what evidence he has that these terrorists rights have been denied them or abused. The defense attorney will respond that not one of his clients every received their Miranda Rights upon being arrested so their constitutional rights have been denied them for as many as 9 years. I dare say your honor that the civil suit will be sizable, reaching into multiple millions of dollars. \n \n And you know what? The judge will have to agree with the defense according to american civilian law. That's why non american foreign combatants have no place in a civilian court of law. they belong in a military tribunal where soldiers belong who have committed crimes as foreign combatants against a country they consider to be foreign enemies. It's a no brainer really. For anyone except this insane administration.",
