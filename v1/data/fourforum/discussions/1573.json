NOT on what I believe to be the correct answer. (I hate it when people do that.)\n \n Let's agree on the format then I will start the thread. Cool?\n \n See the rules for debates thread done by DSAdevil. I agree with those rules except I propose 7 posts instead of nine. Also, NO interlopers. No one else should post on the thread until I submit the final decision. DSA: You will need to record the results in the appropriate locale.\n \n Let me know folks. whoops one more thing. You each will have one week to post.",
