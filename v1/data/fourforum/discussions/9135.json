He/she is not. Of the 3 branches of government the people are represented in the House of Representatives, the states in the Senate and the executive branch represents no one, it executes and administers the policies set by the representative branches. FWIW, the electoral college does not even require that the states choose presidential electors by popular vote. The states are free to choose their presidential electors by drawing lots if they so choose. That your state chooses to use the popular vote gives you the same say as everyonbe else in your state. It does not mean your vote counts as much as the vote of anyone in any other state.",

The only problem now is shaving federal power to what the constitution says. \n \n In theory the breakdown of power is supposed to be as follows: (federal)\n [*]People[*]Congress (legislative)[*]Executive[*]Judicial\n Currently the executive and judical has the most with the congress trying to get rid of as much as possible and the people having next to nothing :)",

If you ever look at the tracking of a stock over the course of a week you will see the thing go up and done like crazy as it changes. Many graphs will show this as it looks like a bunch of peaks and valleys going nuts. This is how public opinion is...changing at a crazy rate with very little consistency or calm changing behavior. Now, if you attach a \"trend analysis\" to that graph you get a nice sloping line that won't change at every whim but is rather gradual. This is what a republic does....smooths things out, makes change more gradual, and allows time for opinions to really be looked at before being put into place.\n \n So thats how I look at it :)",

   "First:\n If you want to get technical, America is a Federal Constitutional Republic who's government operates as a Representative Democracy through the Congressional System. \n \n In other words, in theory, we are a republic that practices representative democracy. I did not think I needed to be that specific for you, but there you go. \n \n Second:\n I understand how the electoral college works. I understand why we came up with the idea of using the electoral college (though we did not think of it). I understand how the votes are counted, and the role that electors play in the process. I do not like a system that could in theory allow (and has 2 possibly 3 times [4 if you count 1824]) someone to win the popular vote, yet lose the electoral vote and not become president. If 21,000,000 people vote for X, and 21,000,001 vote for Y, Y should win. And I guess I should not say that not every vote is counted. In theory, every vote is counted....but not every vote matters (winner take all concept). Also, the electoral college plays to and protects a 2 party system, leaving little hope of ever getting anything other than the tradiitional Republican / Democrat trash that we have seen for the last 30 years who are too busy arguing over party lines than to actually work together to accomplish anythying. \n \n Third:\n I did not call for getting rid of the presidency, senate, congress, or anything else for that matter other than the electoral college. Just because I do not like the way we vote does not mean that I do not believe in the insitutions we vote for. There is a distinction...one that I am sure you are both smart enough to understand. \n \n Fourth: \n I general, the American public is ignorant to the political system in this country, and how we actually put poeple in office. Moreover, the American public by large is uneducated about who we are putting into office. I know and have met many people who simply go and vote straight ticket, or vote for who their church says to vote for...or who their boss says they should vote for...or who the AARP says they should vote for. Many people do not take the time to educate themselves about the issues, the candidates, and where the candidates stand on the issues. I want no part of this red and blue 2 ring circus. I would rather waste my time on this forum telling you why I will not waste my time going to vote. :)",
