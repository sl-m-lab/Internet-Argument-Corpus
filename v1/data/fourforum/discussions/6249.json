Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures...\"\n \n \n If we had conclusive proof about fetal pain, would it change not only the way abortions are performed but also if they were performed (after the designated 'pain point') at all?",

   "Actually, this bit is more important:\n \nFetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks' gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. \n \n \n It means that before 23 weeks, there is nothing to feel pain with and it takes even longer for the full apparatus of pain to build up. (20 weeks = 140 days = 5+months - well over a half of the pregnancy).",

I'm not sure what the point is here...but I guess it is related to the unborn.\n \n It is interesting to point out that someone with a spinal cord injury might not be able to feel pain as well.",
