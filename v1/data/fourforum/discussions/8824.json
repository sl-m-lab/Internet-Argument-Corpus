   "Getting back on topic, here's an editorial about Chris Matthews in particular, who's become peculiarly silent on the matter all of a sudden . . . \n \n \"One of the biggest media figures boycotting the Plame story has been MSNBC host Chris Matthews who has yet to mention the scandal at all since the Armitage report broke, a dramatic contrast to the 27 times he mentioned the \"scandal\" in the five months leading up to it. Last night, I went to a press conference/party held by MSNBC and National Journal celebrating a new venture the two media outlets are launching together. Quite a few NBCers were there, including Chris Matthews. I struck up a conversation with the host about the topic of Plame and why he hadn't talked about the story at all. Here's a rough transcript of our discussion which I wrote down shortly thereafter:\n \n Q: So I've noticed you haven't done anything on the whole Valerie Plame story since the Armitage story broke. Why not invite Joe Wilson on the show to defend himself?\n \n A: Because he'd say basically the same thing he always says. 'My wife had no involvement in getting me the mission.' He'd just repeat it over and over.\n \n Q: Maybe, but isn't it at least worth showing your viewers that this guy has no credibility considering how much you talked about the story before? Shouldn't he be held accountable for wasting all our time? Why not invite one of his representatives or defenders on the show?\n \n A: Well, the story's just gotten so complicated. I mean, it's just such a mess. Because what if it's true that Armitage was the source, but those other guys [presumably Rove and Scooter Libby], also were leakers, what then?\n \n Q: Isn't that a question worth exploring on your show?\n \n A: It could be but the problem is that Dick Cheney has so many apologists it's ridiculous. So many journalists like Bob Woodward will say or do anything just to get access to him. And then all the people in the administration too.\n \n Q: I don't see why this is stopping you from mentioning the story at all. The viewers at least need some sort of closure don't they?\n \n A: Hey listen I need to get out of here. I have to get back home.\n \n After that remark, Matthews left the conversation. He stuck around for about 15 minutes before leaving.\n http://newsbusters.org/stories/matthews_says_plame_story_too_complicated.html",

Libby is no less guilty not only of leaking the name, but of lying before the grand jury to cover it up.\n \n The likely scenario here is that the Bush administratio, probably rove, libby, and Cheny, spread the name around. Armitage picked it up and didn't realize it was classified. He has refered it several times as \"gossip that was going around\".\n \n This is really the only thing that makes sense. According to the bush adminsitration, they declassified the information and then classified the fact that they had declassifed it (they never explained why they would do classify the declassification, but its the bushies...they classify everything). Why declassify it if you are not going to release it??\n \n THAT is what kept Rove and Libby from being indicted for mishandling classified information. Cheney came out and said \"we declassifed it\" and those charges died.",

   "Fiedman was wrong about that, JP. The depression started when a great big honking equity bubble popped (the msot public even there was black thursday, but the bubble included real estate as well). The Fed tried to fight inflation by tightening the money supply, but demand for expansion capital was FLAT. Using rates to tighten the money supply only works if it cools demand for expansion capital, thus clowing the creation of fiat money. If there is no demand for expansion capital, it does not matter where you put rates. Despite the rate rises, commerical borrowing was unchanged, which indicates that the rate increases did not have their desired effect.\n \n Unfettered captialism did not cause the depression, nor did a contraction of money supply. What caused the depression was largely the loose fiscal policies of the fed that caused the boom in the 20's. They ran a policy that led to the creation of huge amounts of capital and equity markets soaked it up, building na ever bigger bubble. \n \n We have this problem where people fear deflation and we take extraordinary measures to combat it. In reality, deflation is kind of the ugly side of the market cycle. It is a natural phenomenon that shoudl be allowed when it comes. If we boost liquidity to combat deflation, we ultimatly end up building bigger and bigger bubbles (because markets WILL soak up the excess capital) then, when those bubbles burst, things are terrible nto becuase deflation HAS TO BE devestating, but because we have put it off and built a false economy. The problem has not gone away...the disease has not been cured...the painkiller just made us feel better for a while. \n \n Andrew Mellon had it right:\n \n \n\"Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. . . . [That] will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. People will work harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people\"\n\n \n They had built an unsustainable economy, and the depression was essentially a correction.\n \n The problem is that for nearly 100 years now our economy has been built on a capitalist theroy that is flawed. I am not necessariyl saying that capitalism as a whole is junk, just portions of it that unfortunatly have played heavily into our economic planning. The component of which I speak is the infinite growth doctorine. In order for capitalism as we practice it to work and be effective, it requires that you never stop growing. Infinite growth is required. Now, any reasonable person can look at that and immediatly recognize that when you are dealing with a finite number of people and a finite number of resources, infinite growth is simply not possible. By trying to emulate infinite growth, though we set ourselves up for major falls. We essentially pretend our economic base grew when in fact it did not, and this invariably leads to collapse when reality finally sets in. \n \n If you look at the foundations of that economic theory, it is easy to see how the mistake was made. Our economic theory was essentially forged by people who lived in a bigger world with a lot fewer people in it and a LOT mroe room for growth. It is likely that it never occured to the british that one day they might end up having to pay handsomly for resources instead of just taking them. It certainly never occured ot the Americans that their resources may one day become scarce. Bad news...it happened, and now we are stuck trying to push a system based on an infinite availability of resources in a world where resources are starting to become scarce.",

Armitage outed Plame well before Libby and Fitzgerald knew that through Armitage's sworn testimony...which occurred prior to Libby's false statements in my read of the events is accurate.\n\n \n BUT, Libby outed plame to 3 different reporters over a week before armitage passed the information on to Novak (Miller, Pincus and Russurt). What liobbey got in trouble for was lying to the grand jury specifically about the timing of those conversations. He essentially tried to time shift them by 2 weeks, as well as to imply that the reporters he leaked it to already had the information and were simply looking for confirmation when in fact none of them had the information.\n \n Now that the Armitage conneciton is in the open, it is pretty clear that what happened is that Libby leaked the information to several reporters and none of them ran with it. We know the Bush administration was spreading it around (this also was part of the fitzgerald investigation and the root of the \"mishandling of classified materials\" charge). Finally Armitage, who heard it as \"gossip going around\" mentioned it to Novak, who used the information in his story.\n \n Then, when it became apparent that somebodies head was going on the block, Libby tried to make it appear that he had not leaked it originally, but rather that he had discussed it AFTER some unknown individual had leaked it to Novak. \n \n So, in comes Carl Rove, who testifies. Subsequent testimony shows that mant of his statements were, like Libbys, lies that were specifically designed to shift the time frame. BUT, before anythign can really be done, the Bush adminstration sends Cheney out to say that HE had declassified the material, so leaking it was not a crime. \n \n This DOES shed a lot of light on Libbys actions. For example, it did not make a whole lot of sense that he would lie just to switch the time frame. I think everybody was confused about that becuase it was assumed that Libby and Rove conspired to leak it to novak. Frankly, Fitzgerald looked a little silly focusing on that. BUT now that we know that Fitzgerald knew who leaked it to Novak, that makes a lot more sense.

Funny how you think that the money supply had something to do with companies going bankrupt and millions of people loosing millions on margin calls.\n\n \n \n JPs position is not out of line with speculaiton on the matter. In fact, Milton Friedman actually believed that the depression was cayse primarily though a contraction of the money supply, and that had the fed increased money, it woudl not have happened. Basically, he championed the greenspan approach to the bursting of a bubble... print money and try to inflate the bubble away. \n \n Now we have seen a few central banks try to do that in a few different countries, so we know it does not work. If you try to inflate the bubble away you simply end up with an even bigger bubble in another segment of the market. Greenspan tried to inflate away a trillion dollar dot com bubble and now we are sittign on a $3 trillion real estate bubble. Looking at other countries that have had RE bubbles burst, that is kind of the final chapter, there is typically no market large enough to take in that kind of money, and the effects of such a burst are so devestating at the consumer level that the economy cannot absorb the shock. \n \n The view JP is putting forth here was for a number of years (and still is to some extent) the \"correct\" answer to the \"why we had the great depression\" question. It is only with the addition of a fairly modern hindsight that we can see that the theory falls down.",

Even the outskirts of the major cities were reminicent of Rawanda, with cardboard shanty towns stretching on for miles. \n \n Now that the average salary for production workers has fallen below $2 per day, foreign firms are in there to exploit the cheap, educated labor pool to make junk for export.\n \n I was there looking at potential vacation properties. I checked out locations in Argentenia, Venezuela, Chile and Belize. Argentenia was the only place that we required an armed escort to leave the major cities.

Since a nasty side effect of that 3000% inflation was the default on hundreds of thousadns of home loans, there are a hell of a lot of people living in those shanty towns and squatting. \n \n \nThat may not mean much to you as you're a fan of current US administration and their fiscal policies. Keep an open mind. 3000% inflation is not for those dependent on anything but his or her own abilities.\n\n \n Personally I watch Argentenia pretty closely, and it scares the hell out of me. I have always wondered how well the US public is likely to take a massive standard of living shift. The population of Argentenia is very similar to that of the US, an educated population largely accustoemd to wealth and creature comforts. The results of the economich shifts there have not been pretty. They do manage, to some degree, to keep the major cities fairly safe, but once you leave those safe havens, you are anybodies victim. That is one major difference in argentenia, though. Their cities were primarily populated by the wealthy. They kep the poor trash out of the city limits.
