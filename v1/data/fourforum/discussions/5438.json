   "Actually, I'm sort of neutral about this. Maybe Europe ought to get it a try and see if they make a go of it. On the other hand, the fact that they have been such fair weather \"friends\" I sort of want the Euro to go down in flames. But that's just me.\n ============================\n \n How long can the euro live as an orphan?\n The Daily Telegraph ^ | 28/05/2005 | Ambrose Evans-Pritchard\n \n \n Break-up of family home makes the currency vulnerable to a double No vote, writes Ambrose Evans-Pritchard\n \n The prospect of a double \"No\" to Europe's constitution in France and Holland has already claimed its first victims, catching hedge funds off guard as the euro slumped to seven-month lows against the dollar, and battering Turkish, Balkan and East European bonds.\n \n This is just a foretaste of what could happen once investors start to think through the euro's long-term chances of survival in a \"post-federal\" Europe that is no longer moving ineluctably towards ever-closer union.\n \n Can a stateless currency hold together in a mere \"zone\" of 12 sovereign states, with a half-constructed legal base, while its economies are moving in starkly different directions? France's Jacques Chirac may not have been exaggerating when he warned on Thursday that a No would lead to the \"breakdown\" of Europe.\n \n In Rome, Italy's Silvio Berlusconi was already taking precautionary steps, summoning Moody's credit watchdog to the Palazzo Grazioli in a bid to fend off a calamitous downgrade of Italian sovereign debt.\n \n In London his finance minister pleaded for patience from hedge funds and money barons, promising to stop Italy's public debt - 106pc of GDP and rising - from spiralling out of control. He offered to sell the state's most precious assets if necessary, though not much remains beyond the Pantheon and Abruzzo National Park.\n \n Hubristic talk that the euro would soon displace the dollar as the world's reserve currency has been silenced by a flurry of analysts' reports warning that monetary union is becoming unmanageable and could collapse, leaving holders of Italian, Greek and Portuguese state bonds with a wicked haircut.\n \n Joachim Fels, Morgan Stanley's eurozone economist, wrote of a cocktail of \"lethal\" developments facing monetary union, predicting that a French No vote could prove to be the trigger that prompts investors to rethink the credit-worthiness of the high-debt states. \"The bond markets are far too complacent about the risk of an EMU break-up,\" he said.\n \n Europe's elites reacted with scorn when he first began to ring alarm bells. \"Now they are listening,\" says Fels...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/05/28/cceuro28.xml&menuId=242&sSheet=/money/2005/05/28/ixcoms.html",
