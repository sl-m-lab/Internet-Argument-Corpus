   "so this is my first thread let a know if i will fit in here? i wrote this after hearing a question on slavery reparations in the iowa debate?\n \n Slave reparations\n \n I am for giving slavery reparations to all black slaves and making the slave owners pay it! Given that slavery was abolished 150 years ago and both parties are dead and no black man women or child have been a slave in U.S. since then. I think its people looking for a hand out and how much would be enough? How much money would it take to pay for the horrible things that slave owners did to your great, great, great, great, grandparents? If reparations are paid are people going to never bring up slavery reparations again? How would we learn from this grave mistake? How are reparations going to move this country and it people forward? Who should pay for them? Tens of millions of family's came to America after slavery was abolished, black and white. Should they all pay an extra tax or receive money for something there ancestors did not even experience?\n \n Think forward think proactive for example there is a black man running for president and people of all colors are voting by the millions for him. Black people have just as much a chance as white although I believe black people have to fight a lot harder for that chance. Getting ahead in life is a choice, stay in school don't do drugs. And for god sake speak properly if you want people to take you seriously i.e. name one black or white that speaks \"Ebonics\" that is successful in America that is not an actor, singer, and pro athlete it's hard. I believe most young black children believe the only way they will be rich is if they are a pro athlete or a rapper this is not rout there are successful black men and women in all types of successful careers: congressmen, senators, governors, lawyers, judges, doctors, scientist, CEO's, astronauts the list goes on forever and it continues to grow. The black Americans that are joining this growing list are people who make a difference and want better life not just for them but for their children's children. \n I hear black Americans saying Germany paid the Jews reparations why can't the U.S. pay us? And this is somewhat true. In 1952 West Germany agreed to pay Israel reparations for slave labor, property stolen by the Nazi, and persecution of the Jews. This was 7 years after the war. Reparations were paid direct to Jewish survivors and close surviving relatives i.e. widows, widowers, children and parents no Jew got money for another Jews death or slavery that was not a survivor or immediate family member. Other money was set aside by Israel to build infrastructure, schools, temples and buildings in Israel a country which was to become a sanctuary for persecuted Jews from around the world. In fact you had to move to Israel to really even collect full reparations. So should America displace all African Americans wishing to collect slavery reparations to Africa and then pay them? So for you to compare reparations paid to the people who experienced the holocaust to today's black Americans getting slavery reparations whose great ancestors experienced slavery is an insult to the Jews and Jewish holocaust survivors.\n \n I hear African Americans say there ancestors were forced to come here in their argument for slavery reparations and there is no doubt that they were. during that time Africa was according to history, a beautiful \"peaceful\" place to live mostly small self-governing tribes and yes there was wars between rival tribes but there was also plenty food clean water and freedom and if they were given the choice to become slaves in America or stay in their village they would stay in Africa. But in coming to the U.S. some good came out not for them, or even their grandchildren, but for the black Americans who live today. Much of the land your African ancestors were forced from are third world countries today. Turn on the news and you will see a much different Africa your ancestors left. They are starving there is little food and clean water millions die every year from starvation and disease and millions more are slaughtered like cattle by militias and their own government. Ask yourself is this a place you want to live? While you're out clothes shopping their children are making your clothes in sweatshops while you're learning algebra there learning how to field strip ak47s while you're fighting for reparations they are fighting to live. The U.S. pledges millions of dollars in food and medical aid to them should they instead give that money to black Americans. I think buy bring this in to the argument you are saying.\" I deserve reparations because I could be in Africa\" in that case how about a one way plane ticket? I doubt anyone would want to take that.\n I hear black Americans who say they want free college tuition in part of their reparation claims. Now this is a step in the right direction but it is also one step back in the wrong direction. As this would be racist whites, Mexicans and Asians would have to pay for collage but black Americans would not. Every one of every race would have to pay a higher tax that only on race could take advantage of isn't goal here to stop racism and racial preference. This would be giving preference to one race and not the other. Whoever there are hundreds maybe thousands of free government funded scholarships that any race can apply for and there are private ones as well aimed at race ever here of the (United Negro College Fund) give them a call if you are looking for free tuition or better yet you could join the military they pay for college and it looks great on a political resume if you're looking in to changing this country \n If you still believe after reading this that you are owed slavery reparations and they are your only hope this, than your hope is lost and I'm sorry for there are many private and government programs out there aimed toward black Americans to help you get on your feet and ahead in life. And yes there could be more. So what are you going to do ask for slavery reparations? Or get ahead in this country and make something of yourself and create more jobs and programs for Americans.\n \n \n \n \n By J.P. Donoghue \n I hate saying \"black Americans\" or\" African Americans\" I would rather just say Americans but given the topic it would be hard not to. And I'm sorry if one of those or both offend anyone",

   "Since all Americans pay taxes, who would be paying the reparations? \n Would it go so far as to \"not tax\" blacks so as to insure that they were not paying themselves? \n American blacks have in the last 20 years resorted to calling themselves \n \"African Americans\". Why? Iron Courage brought up the differences in today's Africa and the Africa of the days when people were being abducted and sold into slavery. The facts concerning slavery, are that the English and French slave traders could never have captured Africans in the numbers that they did without collaboration from native Africans. Familiarity of terrain and tribal habits being a major obstacle for the invaders. Remember, killing and conquering was not the goal. The goal was to capture alive the most healthy and sellable. There is no way to attack a tribe with the intent to capture the warriors without a fight. Which would likely kill the best of the tribes, without deceit. \n Great efforts to put white America on a guilt trip should at least have been shared by the Brits, French and Africans who made slavery a possibility in America.",

   "If the conversation is limited to reparations for black slavery in the United States and is not to include the global slave trade market, there is no sense discussing it. The attempt should be to make the originator pay for slavery-related damages to a race of people and should be directed toward civilizations in the far distant past rather than take the form of some ridiculous attempt to have the present day Americans pay the present day blacks for something that neither one of them had a thing to do with.\n \n Slavery has been around for thousands of years. Slavery still exists. (Try India, Pakistan and others where children are bought and sold for labor and sex. Even in the US today, the sex-slave trade is alive and well.)\n \n Egyptians used Jews....make them pay.\n \n Germans used Jews....make them pay.\n \n Japanese used Americans....make them pay.\n \n Americans stole everything the native American Indians had...make them pay. Let's give all the land back to the decendents of the redskins.\n \n \n Africans were enslaving and selling other Africans when the Dutch started buying them. Make the decendents of the African slaves who enslaved Africans pay the decendents of the African slaves. Black pays black. They are the ones who started the trading of black slaves anyway. Make the Dutch pay. (Good luck!) \n \n My ancestors had nothing to do with slavery. Why should I pay a single nickle to someone who does not deserve it anyway and certainly shouldn't be looking to me to pay for something that some African tribe started in the first place?\n \n Reparations is just another way for worthless bums like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to use the media to gain sympathy for their poor, oppressed brothers and sisters...forever and ever and ever and ever.\n \n You'll hear Little Jimmy Carter come out for reparations too. A lot of liberals will favor it forever just as a vote-attracting tool for the liberal/socialist movement.\n \n If my opinions of reparations are not clear to you, please educate yourself and call me back.",

   "How about we just call it even. Otherwise, we'd have to get out the calculator and find out what the world owes the US for saving the freedom of all the nations against Nazis and Communism and etc...\n\n You see? I agree with you here though on another issue you go liberal bashing up my backside. You don't know anything about me. There is a time for personal responsibility to take the place of blame for sins of the father, or the great great great great great great grandfather. There is also a time to realize that we all need each other to survive, and that you can succeed without having to cause others to fail. Slavery was wrong, but it is done. \n \n As far as your example, take the French for another. After defending France from the Commie horde for four decades, their major aircraft manufacturer wins a bid against our own to supply jetliners to a major airline. They were able to do this with their nationalized industry because their government didn't bear the cost of their own defense for all that time. So our defense of another nation results in the subsidy of one of their industries' defeat of one of our own. \n \n Do you think that's fair? Of course it isn't. Should Airbus pay reparations to the employees of Boeing? Of course not. Should the policy have been considered more thoroughly? Of course it should have.\n \n Free trade isn't fair trade, protectionism isn't equal, though I'm for it when it is, tit for tat with a competitor. Do you think that liberal of me?\n \n I don't think anyone should pay anybody anything for reparations, but we should still do what we can to uplift our fellow man. It's our responsibility as humans. Why do we give tax breaks to churches and charities? Why do we allow donation deductions? If we are truly giving, we shouldn't care about the return. Is that liberal of me, too?\n \n I don't really give a damn about Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan or Mexico. Am I a pinko? I feel bad for blacks, but I don't feel responsible. Am I a commie? I don't really care about you, either, any of you. Yet I don't wish you any harm, though I suspect the world may indeed be a better place without some of you around, I wouldn't suggest you kill yourselves. That's entirely your choice.\n We don't really owe each other anything.",

There was a time frame for that to happen, it almost sort of did in a negligible way, and what little former slaves did get in help from the government was swindled away just as quickly.... by the FREE MARKET!!!\n \n It's been lack of familiarity with our society and the free market that has kept the poor disenfranchised. Of course, whenever any ethnic group (especially of color) happens to come close to achieving a new milestone of movement towards equality, they are discriminated against by statute or other government endorsed sanction or set of actions. \n \n Do some research about California's race laws, especially the ones about who could and couldn't own land, intermarry, etc. There was a time that an American white who married someone of a certain ethnic group would lose their property because of it.\n \n All we can do is try and move forward together.

   "Paying reparations is BS especially when the biggest supporters of it are people who don't want to work, or contribute to society in any way shape or form! My mother came from Colombia over 25 years ago. She is mestizo. Should the Spanish, or Portuguese pay reparations to the rest of mestizo/indigenous South America? What about the Jews. Should Rome, Germany, Japan, Egypt, have to pay reparations to them? Slavery isn't a black condition, as much as some American hating blacks think it is.... Almost every culture/race has been subject to some form of slavery, or indentured servitude. The Same goes with affirmative action. My mother came from money in South America, and after my Grandfather died all of his estranged children from other women came with lawyers and swallowed everything that was my Grandmother's (his legal wife), and my mother's. My mom was 16 at that time. They came to the USA and she began working cleaning houses, and from there she built her medical billing business with her sister and they have both made a success of themselves. She's 48 now! To hell wit affirmative action, and other \"minority help\" programs. It's absolute garbage that we as tax paying American's have to cater to people that refuse to work, and #### out 7 kids to keep their lazy lifestyle. When people genuinely need the help it's one thing, but when it's obvious that someone is milking the system because of their color.... No wonder racism still exist.... It's either a product of being uneducated, and misinformed, or because YOU aren't doing anything to better the situation of YOUR people. BTW before anyone of \"color\" takes offense to this, grow up!

I think its people looking for a hand out and how much would be enough? How much money would it take to pay for the horrible things that slave owners did to your great, great, great, great, grandparents? If reparations are paid are people going to never bring up slavery reparations again? How would we learn from this grave mistake? How are reparations going to move this country and it people forward? Who should pay for them? Tens of millions of family's came to America after slavery was abolished, black and white. Should they all pay an extra tax or receive money for something there ancestors did not even experience?\n\n \n Slave owners do owe African Americans something, no one else does. I don't, and neither do any of my fellow white Americans because we were not slave owners.
