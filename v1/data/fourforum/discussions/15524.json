   "This is what he said.. from your link...\n \n Muslims are calling for the execution for homosexuals in America, this was just released yesterday and it shows you that they themselves are upholding the laws that are even in the Bible, the Judeo Christian God. They seem to be more moral than even the American Christians do. Because these people are livid about enforcing their laws, they know homosexuality is an abomination. And I continually reach out to the homosexual communities on this radio show, and I warn them, which ones love? Here you have Obama condemning it behind the backs of the homosexuals but to their faces he's promoting it. I say this to my gay friends out there the ones that continuously nitpick everything I say. Hollywood is promoting immorality and the God of the Heavens in Jesus names is warning you to flee from the wrath to come, yet you have Muslims calling for your execution. If America won't enforce the laws, God will raise up a foreign enemy to do just that's what you're seeing in America today. Read Leviticus 26 America.\n \n He's supporting the fact that Muslims Kill Homosexuals. He even says \" If America won't enforce the \" LAW\" then God will raise up a foreign enemy to do just. \n \n His case against Rachel Maddow is dead on arrival, just another Homophobic religious zealot trying to cash in ... How pathetic.",

Maybe it will start making some of these commentators start treating religious groups with more fairness when it comes to issues like this.\n \n Rachel Maddow, MSNBC sued for defamation\n\n \n Well, outside of a biased news souce like World Net Daily, the Huffington Post puts a different spin, and more than likely, closer to the truth:\n \n Rachel Maddow Sued By Christian Rocker Bradlee Dean\n \n \"Dean charged Maddow with deliberately ignoring a disclaimer that he issued which stressed that he was not calling for gay people to be killed. He said Maddow's airing of his statement caused \"serious\" harm to him and the ministry he runs.\n \n Actually, Maddow did read the disclaimer--\"we have never and will never call for the execution of homosexuals\"--just after airing Dean's statement.\n Dean also said he is an ally of Michele Bachmann, and accused Maddow and the \"left wing media\" of using him to harm her presidential prospects. Even though he is filing a multi-million dollar lawsuit, Dean said that \"money is not the issue.\"\n \n MSNBC called the suit \"baseless\" in a statement.\n \n \n Nothing to see here.- poet.",
