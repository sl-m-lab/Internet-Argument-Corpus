   "How Much Does America Pay for Supporting the Israelis?\n \n by Tom Stauffer\n \n Alfred Lilienthal posed the question of what the cost of supporting Israel was to the US 40 years ago, when the price tag for Americans was low.\n \n Today the answer is knowable and daunting - the figure comes to at least $1.6 trillion through the end of 2002.\n \n That is some three times the much-publicized cost of the Vietnam War (all figures are expressed in current dollars, corrected for inflation). The overall cost to the US of all aspects of conflicts in the Middle East is even higher _ more than $2.6 trillion.\n \n But the multi-dimensioned costs of supporting and protecting Israel make up nearly two-thirds of the total.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2236\n \n \n The High Price of American Alliance With Israel\n \n By Lisa Guliani\n \n The U.S. government doles out more money per year to help Israeli citizens than it does to help Americans. Think about how bizarre that is for a moment. Yet, nobody DARES to challenge this openly. Okay, so I'll challenge it.\n \n And, in FY2003, our President requested \"Foreign Assistance\" funds for Israel as follows:\n \n *For Counter Terrorism for FY 2002: $28 Million\n *For Foreign Military Financing: $2.1 Billion\n *For Economic Support: $600 Million\n *For Refugee Settlement Funds: $60 Million\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.federalobserver.com/archive.php?aid=5901",

   "The Strategic Function of US Aid to Israel\n \n By Stephen Zunes\n \n Dr. Zunes is an assistant professor in the Department of Politics at the University of San Francisco\n \n Since 1992, the U.S. has offered Israel an additional $2 billion annually in loan guarantees. Congressional researchers have disclosed that between 1974 and 1989, $16.4 billion in U.S. military loans were converted to grants and that this was the understanding from the beginning.\n \n Indeed, all past U.S. loans to Israel have eventually been forgiven by Congress, which has undoubtedly helped Israel's often-touted claim that they have never defaulted on a U.S. government loan. U.S. policy since 1984 has been that economic assistance to Israel must equal or exceed Israel's annual debt repayment to the United States. Unlike other countries, which receive aid in quarterly installments, aid to Israel since 1982 has been given in a lump sum at the beginning of the fiscal year, leaving the U.S. government to borrow from future revenues. Israel even lends some of this money back through U.S. treasury bills and collects the additional interest.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.washington-report.org/us_aid_to_israel/index.htm\n \n \n The Real Cost of US Support for Israel: $3 Trillion\n \n http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/article.asp?ID=831",
