Maybe you don't own a tv, maybe you don't own a brain. Who knows, it could be both. But during the 3rd and final debate the issue of immigration was brought up. Here is George Bush's response:\n \n \n \n \"I see it as a serious problem. I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue.\n \n We're increasing the border security of the United States. We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.\n \n We're using new equipment. We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across.\n \n And we'll continue to do so over the next four years. It's a subject I'm very familiar with. After all, I was a border governor for a while.\n \n Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. They're coming here to work. \n \n If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. And that's what's happening.\n \n And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary  worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.\n \n That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. \n \n It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families. See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.\n \n It also means it takes pressure off the border. If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border. It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.\n \n Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty. I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior. There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen. And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.\n \n If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.\n \n And here is where my opponent and I differ. In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.\"\n \n \n \n \n Bush explicitly stated, word for word, \"it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty.\" How much clearere can he get?",

Very little would be considered an undisputed fact. I'm speaking predominately about the Political Forum. Go back to when Bush first introduced the plan to \"legalize illegals\" and you'll see that EVERYONE that responded labeled it amnesty. It doesn't get any simpler, someone who snuck into the country illegally could apply for citizenship at a later date after meeting certain criteria.

It is impossible. We can't put them in jail when they try to come over again, so it just creates a revolving door where they come here illegally, get caught, go back to Mexico, and try again until they get across. These illegals are a burden to our society. We as taxpayers pay for their healthcare and government subsidized housing and education. If we offer a temporary work program with the possibility of becoming a legal citizen, they will have to pay taxes and therefore contribute to public and social service here in the US rather than mooch off of the taxpayers.\n \n \n \nHere in California we don't have room for the illegals that are here now, let alone people coming in under a \"work visa\" program. All the programs, emergency services and the like, are being drowned under the weight of illegals.\n\n \n Illegals will eventually have to leave if they can't get a job. If we require ALL employers to ask for a document proving either US citizenship or a temporary work card before hiring, all illegals will have no reason to come here because they won't be able to work. We then punish corporations and businesses who hire people without these documents, and in turn that encourages Mexicans to go through the legal process.\n \n \nCan you give me the source of your numbers? I'm not sure we would know how many come over, but regardless 3 million a year is overburdening the rest of us. And the \"work visa\" program helps this how?\n\n \n \n Sure, from the September 20 TIME magazine...\n \n -In 1 year, 3 million illegals make their way across the US/Mexico border.\n \n -This is triple the number of Mexicans who come here legally (that means that if we get rid of the incentive for illegals to come here, we could alleviate 3 million people who don;t pay taxes flooding our economy each year).\n \n -\"No one knows how many illegals are living in the US, but estimates run as high as 15 million\"\n \n -(Sorry, the 7 million stat referred to something else.) In a 9 month period in 2003, border patrol apprehended 1.1 million illegals. For every 1 apprehended, 3 get across.\n \n \n \n The reason illegals come here is to get work. The temporary work visas helps out both us and Mexico. The way it is now without the work visa, 3 million illegals come here each year and flood the job market. They don't stay here temporarily, they remain here. At the same time, they don't pay taxes, which all other US citizens do, yet the benfit just as someone who does pay taxes. By imposing very strict laws on businesses to ask for a green card, form of US citizenship, or a worker card before hiring someone we can get rid of the illegals who come here because they won't be able to get jobs.

   "Nobody has a plan that will deport illegals.\n\n \n Agreed. And that is something we should do.\n \n \n\n It is impossible.\n\n \n This I don't believe.\n \n \n\n We can't put them in jail when they try to come over again, so it just creates a revolving door where they come here illegally, get caught, go back to Mexico, and try again until they get across.\n\n \n And, according to your stats, they have a better chance of getting across than getting caught. Why not just try again?\n \n \n\n These illegals are a burden to our society. We as taxpayers pay for their healthcare and government subsidized housing and education. If we offer a temporary work program with the possibility of becoming a legal citizen, they will have to pay taxes and therefore contribute to public and social service here in the US rather than mooch off of the taxpayers.\n\n \n Why would they want to? What incentive do they have? The \"work visa\" program gives them what exactly? The ability to pay taxes?\n \n \n\n Illegals will eventually have to leave if they can't get a job.\n\n \n Hah! Then why aren't they leaving now?\n \n \nIf we require ALL employers to ask for a document proving either US citizenship or a temporary work card before hiring, all illegals will have no reason to come here because they won't be able to work. We then punish corporations and businesses who hire people without these documents, and in turn that encourages Mexicans to go through the legal process.\n\n \n Yes yes yes! That would be a great plan! We have those laws in place but nobody enforces them. If we go after the corporations that hire illegals, we can stop the incentive of coming over. Wonderful. I'm glad someone here sees this. Unfortunately, we are talking about the \"work visa\" program.\n \n \n\n Sure, from the September 20 TIME magazine...\n \n -In 1 year, 3 million illegals make their way across the US/Mexico border.\n \n -This is triple the number of Mexicans who come here legally (that means that if we get rid of the incentive for illegals to come here, we could alleviate 3 million people who don;t pay taxes flooding our economy each year).\n\n \n Completely agree with that second point. If we could stop them coming in, we'd be in better shape. The \"work visa\" program not only does nothing about those already here and more coming in illegally, it invites those who don't want to try illegally to come in legally.\n \n \n\n The reason illegals come here is to get work. The temporary work visas helps out both us and Mexico. The way it is now without the work visa, 3 million illegals come here each year and flood the job market. They don't stay here temporarily, they remain here.\n\n \n I agree. Now, why would they want to come in under a work visa, pay taxes and then have to go home? What is the incentive to work under a work visa? And what provision is there to stop them from staying after the visa expires? We don't crack down on those here illegally now. What makes you believe we'll crack down in this program?\n \n \n\n At the same time, they don't pay taxes, which all other US citizens do, yet the benfit just as someone who does pay taxes.\n\n \n All this and more! Illegal immigration is a huge problem.\n \n \n\n By imposing very strict laws on businesses to ask for a green card, form of US citizenship, or a worker card before hiring someone we can get rid of the illegals who come here because they won't be able to get jobs.\n\n \n You don't get it. What incentive is there for employers to hire those here legally (who would probably want higher pay if they pay taxes) vs. illegal workers? What incentive is there for Mexicans to get a \"work visa\", besides to avoid having to cross the desert? What provisions are there for those coming across illegally? This \"work visa\" program is stupid stupid stupid. We are inviting people to come over legally and nothing to show that we will actually go after them if they stay. It's like legal illegal immigration.\n \n \n\n In turn, we get employees when we need them and when we don't, they go back to Mexico, unlike illegals who stay here and place a burden on society as a whole.\n\n \n Why would they leave? Why wouldn't illegals stay? Not only will the \"work visa\" program not stem the illegal tide, it will invite more people in!\n \n \n\n Why would an illegal come here if he knew he couldn't get a job? The temporary work visa encourages Mexicans to follow the legal process and discourages illegal immigration by making it a crime for those doing the hiring to hire illegals. If these laws are followed, there will be no incentive for illegals to come here.\n\n \n It encourages nothing until we actually deport those here illegally. It is already a crime to hire illegals... but it isn't enforced. You're right, if the laws were followed then there would be no incentive. However, that is true now. If the laws were followed now there wouldn't be a problem that required this program. This program is basically just adding the same laws again, or stricter punishment. However, if they aren't followed anyway why would stricter punishment matter?",

We have current laws on the books that would do what we want to stop immigration. And you say now Bush wants to create new laws that do the same thing, but aren't enforced now.

   "Sigma,\n Here is a simple breakdown of the problem with illegal immigration and what we can do to alleviate it.\n \n \n Problems with illegal immigration\n Each year, 3 million people are coming over here illegally, 3 times the number of people who come here legally and go through the long and drawn out process. Companies would prefer, with our very loose enforcement of the laws, to hire someone for cheaper. Someone here illegally is willing to work for $2 an hour because they will pay no taxes, but somehere here legally, who has to pay taxes, can't afford to make $2 an hour. This encourages illegals to break the rules and come here because they will benefit more than if they receive US citizenship and have to pay taxes. There are approximately 15 million illegals in the US right now. Since they don't pay taxes, how do they get healthcare, housing, and education for them and their children? The government, in the form of our taxes, pays for this. Another problem is the overcrowding we face without the illegals. Many jails are close to their limits. With 3 million illegals making it across and over 1 million being caught each year, we simply don't have the room to put them in our jails, only to have them sent back to Mexico and try again. When they are thrown in jail, they are given a public defender, which you and I are paying for, and they are taken care of with our tax dollars in prison. They are sent back to Mexico and try again, and we continue to go through this endless cycle until the finally get over here, and we still end up paying for them. We are trying to give those who we catch plane tickets to southern Mexico. TIME interviewed several of those apprehended and they said they will just try again in a week. This is no deterrent whatsoever.\n \n \n Solutions to combat illegal immigration\n There are a few solutions to help limit illegal immigration. We can construct an enormous wall to keep them from coming over, which will be expensive, controversial, and probably be fought tooth and nail by the ACLU. Another option is to place more National Guard troops on the border, which will be at an astronomical cost and will require thousands of troops, which will also take away our ability to station troops overseas. I think the best solution is to severely enforce our current laws and punish any and all corporations who continue to hire illegals to the fullest extent. I think the temporary worker program will be a nice complement to the strict enforcement of our current laws. Mexicans will be able to register to get a temporary worker card, and when farmers, for instance, need work and are having trouble finding workers, they call the organization in charge of the program and request workers. This way, illegals have no reason to want to come here if they can't find a job and won't be taken care of by us taxpayers. We should also encourage those who want to move to America to do so legally. Those who are doing that now are being punished for following the law because we are having to limit the number we can allow in the US each year because of the outrageous number of illegals who come here. It only makes sense that if we strictly enforce our current laws we will drastically reduce the illegals who come here. We need to also cut off any and all public services to those illegals who continue to come here, and as soon as we find them, we should deport them back to Mexico. As it is now, they simply try again because they know if they get across they'll get a job. But if we enforce the laws and deport those illegals who we find here, they will eventually get the picture that they won't be taken care of here at the expense of us taxpayers and that they cannot get employed here.",

   "Can I just state the obvious. Illegal workers work for less money than legals. Not only is their wage less than the legal minimum wage, there are no employer taxes. Bookkeeping is taking cash out of the til and handing it to them. The employer saves, can I say, mucho bucks. The employers are not going to be nearly as fascinated by the new legal status applicants. The employers like the illegals. They work for peanuts and they're quiet and grateful.
