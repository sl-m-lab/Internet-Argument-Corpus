Miller\n A bipartisan group of Maryland lawmakers has organized more than 500 church congregations for a huge rally in Annapolis to lobby for a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex \"marriage.\" (Metropolitan)\n\n \n Here's a little something for ya....\n \n Baltimore Presbyterians Back Gay Marriage\n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff \n \n Posted: November 20, 2004 12:01 am ET \n \n \n (Baltimore, Maryland) In a meeting that lasted less than an hour the Baltimore district of the Presbyterian Church (USA) has voted to support a suit by same-sex couples seeking the right to wed in Maryland. \n \n The ACLU of Maryland filed the lawsuit on behalf of nine same-sex couples and a man whose partner recently passed away who would like to be able to marry one day. \n \n Friday the Baltimore presbytery notified the court that it wished to be added to the list of amicus curiae supporting the ACLU position.\n \n A church spokesperson said that the so-called friend of the court brief has not yet been written but predicted that other religious groups would also join the suit.\n \n The decision by the Baltimore presbytery puts it at odds with Presbyterian Church (USA) law. The Church forbids churches from solemnizing same-sex relationships and does not allow openly gay clergy.\n \n In July the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) legislative assembly narrowly rejected a measure Friday to allow regional governing bodies to ordain gay clergy and lay officers. (story) \n \n Conservative Presbyterians had warned that a vote for gay ordination at the denomination's national meeting could cause the largest split in the church since the Civil War, when slavery split the church into Northern and Southern factions.\n \n Opponents of the proposal said a network of 1,300 congregations with 450,000 members was poised to break away. The network, called the Confessing Church Movement, holds as a central doctrine the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman.\n \n The gay marriage is slowly winding its way through Maryland courts and is expected to be decided in the state Supreme Court.\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2004",
