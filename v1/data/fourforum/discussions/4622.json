   "That's right, we didn't know how useful a tool it was for government to seperate the people from their property rights, money, and freedoms. The Democrats are the ones who try to use that tool. \n\n \n Lets take a look at some of these. On the global warming, you are partially correct. The democrats certainly like to beat that drum. At the same time, though, teh republicans have been happy to drag it out when it suits them, such as when they feel compelled to beat companies in Ecuador over the head with something for daring to undercut US corporations.\n \n \n \nDemocrats and Republicans equally support gun control??? LOL\n\n \n From a practical standpoint, yes. Take a look at current gun control laws such as the Brady bill, the GCA of 1968, and the gun owners protection act (what a joke) passed under reagan. The Brady bill was a bipartisan bill. The GCA of 68 was a republican bill. The gun owners protection act was a democratic bill, but if you look at the voting specs on it, it enjoyed strong support from both sides, and Ronald Reagan, being the super republican that he was, signed it into law. \n \n Face it, Marc, your govertnment does not want you armed. Can you blame them? Looking at the current and near future economic status of our nation, including the fact that the middle class is rapidly becoming the lower class, which is one hell of an adjustment, and in reality there is no real hope of turning this around. Couple this with the fact that we are facing a huge nergy problem in the near future. I got an email in my inbox today (a forward). It was a public statement from exxon that they estimate that by 2008 (best case), we will have an 8% oil deficit (8% more demand than supply will provide for). Consider, for the sake of scale, that the big \"oil shortage\" int he 70's, which caused oil prices to jump by over 400% overnight, was caused by a short term 5% shortage. This is an 8% shortage, and projected to get worse every year after 2008. \n \n I can certainly understand why, given the circumtances (a population of largely worthless people whose skills are aimed at the service sector being forced to face a reality which includes hunger and third world living conditions), our politicians would strive to ensure that in the future we will not be able to drag them out and shoot them. Deluding yourself into believeing that one or the other big political parties is somehow a friend to gun owners is not a good way to work the problem, though.\n \n \n \nDemocrats and Republicans equally oppose Christianity??? LMAO\n\n \n Honestly, there is only a very portion of the population that opposed christianity. Neither big party really seems to. this si the case of a VERY small minority whining VERY loudly.\n \n \n \nHow about TAXES?? It's easy to see which party seeks to increase the size and scope of government - the one who seeks to RAISE taxes, not CUT them. I know, there's no difference, right? emoticon_xclown \n \n \n Bush has increased the size of governemtn more than any president since reagan. In recent history, Clinton has increased the size of government the least. Bush passed his tax cuts, then went on to rack up the biggest deficit in history in order to pay for his massive increase in government. Besides being irresponsible, this forced tax burden to the states, which raised taxes in order to pay their bills. Most Americans are paying MORE taxes today than they were before the tax cuts, and Bush knew this would be the case when he passed them. \n \n \n \nLarge corporations donate to Republicans largely because they want to be left ALONE, from things like environmentalist and safety bureaucracies. Democrats get more than just a little money from trial lawyers and the teachers unions, to name only two.\n\n \n Realistically, until the whole school vouchers thing came up, teachers were big supporters of the republican party. I think that if you look into it, you will find that both parties recieve substantial contributions from both corporate sources, wealthy individuals, and unions. \n \n On the whole \"environmental\" thing, I personally have found that under democratic leadership, we get more regulations, but less interventions since they fail to adequatly fund enforcement. Under republicans, we get fewer new regs, but they fund the heck out of enforcement, which hits you pretty hard in the pocket book for compliance. Additionally, while the democrats tend to go after the big polluters (dow chemical), the republicans seem to leave the big guys alone and go after small businesses (me). \n \n At the end of the day, on environmental and safety issues, I prefer the democarats. Let them harass billion dollar corporations. They can afford it. The republicans, going after small business types who cannot afford it just so they can look like they are doing something, are a pain.",

I would agree, however, that these differences are of less consequence than past difference. But the parties certainly are different.\n \n \nProve it. Stop avoiding the question. How can something both support be a difference?\n\n \n Which issues in history have seen a complete split between both parties? There were likely some, but I would argue that the vast majority of issues were not split in such a fashion. But if you pick out a political issue today, I can tell you the specific differences between the average Democrat and the average Republican.\n \n Take the issue of Gun Control: although both parties might agree that some measure of control is necessary, Democrats are far more likely to push for much stronger gun control than Republicans. A Democrat would be far more likely to want to ban guns altogether; certainly a Republican would be very unlikely to hold such a belief. Again, I don't deny the existence of exceptions and support from both sides, but this is still a very distinct and present difference.\n \n I can draw similarly distinct differences in the areas of gun control, school vouchers, religion in publically-funded places, the environment, abortion, taxation, welfare, medical spending, social security, military spending, military use, gay bisexual and transgender rights, hate crime policy, affirmative action, privacy policy, censorship policy, stance on flag burning, stance on restricting the actions of businesses, and many others, I'm sure. I could certainly name the differences between Kerry and Bush on almost all of these issues, and I would even argue that Democrats and Republicans tend to hold a very different belief about the ends of government.\n \n Now none of the things I've mentioned may be as significant as a few specific and important policy differences of past parties like, say, slavery, but even so, I'm willing to bet that the differences between partiers were not often so significant in the past, either.\n \n I do think that having more involvement with a specific party results in a better idea of the differences between those parties. I also think that less people associate their own views along a party line, and that is probably because of a better education, a society that is more accepting of differences, and politicians who try to pass a very generic message so that they will be elected.",

   "Lets take a look at some of these. On the global warming, you are partially correct. The democrats certainly like to beat that drum. At the same time, though, teh republicans have been happy to drag it out when it suits them, such as when they feel compelled to beat companies in Ecuador over the head with something for daring to undercut US corporations.\n\n \n Do U.S. politicians really have that much power, to beat foriegn companies over the head? I'll bet most foriegn companies and their politicians would disagree with you on that.\n \n \n \nFrom a practical standpoint, yes. Take a look at current gun control laws such as the Brady bill, the GCA of 1968, and the gun owners protection act (what a joke) passed under reagan. The Brady bill was a bipartisan bill. The GCA of 68 was a republican bill. The gun owners protection act was a democratic bill, but if you look at the voting specs on it, it enjoyed strong support from both sides, and Ronald Reagan, being the super republican that he was, signed it into law. \n\n \n Republicans are by far the lesser of the two evils.\n \n \nFace it, Marc, your govertnment does not want you armed. Can you blame them? Looking at the current and near future economic status of our nation, including the fact that the middle class is rapidly becoming the lower class, which is one hell of an adjustment, and in reality there is no real hope of turning this around. Couple this with the fact that we are facing a huge nergy problem in the near future. I got an email in my inbox today (a forward). It was a public statement from exxon that they estimate that by 2008 (best case), we will have an 8% oil deficit (8% more demand than supply will provide for). Consider, for the sake of scale, that the big \"oil shortage\" int he 70's, which caused oil prices to jump by over 400% overnight, was caused by a short term 5% shortage. This is an 8% shortage, and projected to get worse every year after 2008. \n\n \n Concealed carry has been making some headway lately. Since we now have Republicans in control of both houses and the President, gun control doesn't seem to be making any real leaps and bounds these days. I think economic problems will arrive long before the American people are disarmed. \n \n \nI can certainly understand why, given the circumtances (a population of largely worthless people whose skills are aimed at the service sector being forced to face a reality which includes hunger and third world living conditions), our politicians would strive to ensure that in the future we will not be able to drag them out and shoot them. Deluding yourself into believeing that one or the other big political parties is somehow a friend to gun owners is not a good way to work the problem, though. \n\n \n Noting that one party is far less of a threat than the other isn't a delusion. You're in a very small minority when you say the U.S. people are largely worthless. That's not a put down, I'm sure you really believe that, but it must be a wierd feeling to live in a country that you despise, and refuse to move to another country, and you seem worship other countries. It's the reason I'm still a little suspicious about your actually being an American.\n \n \n \n \nHonestly, there is only a very portion of the population that opposed christianity. Neither big party really seems to. this si the case of a VERY small minority whining VERY loudly. \n\n \n And almost all of that very small minority are Democrats. And the most effective loudness they have is the many ways they cleverly work to increase the power of activist judges. \n \n \n \n \nBush has increased the size of governemtn more than any president since reagan. In recent history, Clinton has increased the size of government the least. Bush passed his tax cuts, then went on to rack up the biggest deficit in history in order to pay for his massive increase in government. Besides being irresponsible, this forced tax burden to the states, which raised taxes in order to pay their bills. Most Americans are paying MORE taxes today than they were before the tax cuts, and Bush knew this would be the case when he passed them. \n\n \n \n I was talking mainly about federal taxes, not the increase in the size of government, mainly due to 9/11/01. If more in tax is being paid, it's due to economic growth. It's the Republican plan.\n \n \n \nRealistically, until the whole school vouchers thing came up, teachers were big supporters of the republican party. I think that if you look into it, you will find that both parties recieve substantial contributions from both corporate sources, wealthy individuals, and unions. \n\n \n That's true. There's some corruption, but attempts to do nothing but remove the power of MONEY from politics leaves a big hole - there's simply nothing else to replace it. \n \n \nOn the whole \"environmental\" thing, I personally have found that under democratic leadership, we get more regulations, but less interventions since they fail to adequatly fund enforcement. Under republicans, we get fewer new regs, but they fund the heck out of enforcement, which hits you pretty hard in the pocket book for compliance. Additionally, while the democrats tend to go after the big polluters (dow chemical), the republicans seem to leave the big guys alone and go after small businesses (me). \n\n \n Unenforced mandates are not a good thing. I'd like to see some examples - I've never seen a political debate where the Republican declares a lack of pressure on small business, and the opposing Democrat states that he wants to leave the small business alone. I've seen it the other way around though. I guess there are exceptions to every rule, maybe if a Arlan Spector were debating Zell Miller, or George Voinovich were debating..........Joe Lieberman. Those would be rare exceptions though.\n \n The term \"small business\" is interpreted too many different ways. It seems like there are only two definitions of business size; Fortune 500, and \"small business\". Didn't you say your business had $40 million per month in expences? Many people don't consider that \"small\". I tend to think of small business as employing only a few, with an owner who doesn't make any more than the average factory worker. And who is one lawsuit away from losing every single thing he has - someone who has no workman's comp., or unemployment safety nets. \n \n \nAt the end of the day, on environmental and safety issues, I prefer the democarats. Let them harass billion dollar corporations. They can afford it. The republicans, going after small business types who cannot afford it just so they can look like they are doing something, are a pain.\n\n \n DuPont is a billion dollar one, it's a pain for me when Dupont is harassed. It's true they can afford it - I'm reminded of it every time they charge me $300 for $30 worth of car paint. \n \n In my area, local Republicans have clearly opposed auto emissions testing more than local Democrats. That hardly concerns \"billion dollar corporations\".",

Did you know that Clinton allowed Tyson and other polutry producers to skirt pass a number of health regulations, similar to what Bush is doing with the beef? Amazing how they would rather pander to special interests then the health of the US. Another example, democrats seem not inclined to fix the welfare system of the US that by all means is broken. A broken system that sees little good results and sucks taxpayer's dollars. Another example, Dems are not hitting the republicans on Medicare, which will become a HUGE problem in the next few years. Their negligance is dealing with such a issue, even letting the bill Bush passed is going to shaft us ALL. There are PLENTY of other examples, and it's another reason why I loathe parties.\n\n \n Well, I guess I should say that I am a Democrat because I agree with the party ideology, not because I believe that certain Democrats were great or certain Republicans were bad. I am open to the idea of voting for someone of a different party, and I have certainly done so in the past. But I don't think that people with the right morals and values should stay out of the primary parties; we would be better off with those kinds of people being elected.",

   "\n I'm serious too. America is set up as for the most part, free and open. Those who \"get it\", and choose to spend their energy gathering wealth, find that by offereing the appearance of \"stability, teamwork, fairness\", that the average person eats it up and never asks questions. They grow their empire on the backs of \"helots\". If U.S. workers aren't helot enough for you, try multinational inc...such as Nike, who has an army of indonesians working for nothing, to build their empire.\n \n Just look at marc9000's comments for instance. It reads to me like some warped bizarro land...I mean, has the aristocracy really brainwashed the average person into a \"helot\", a slave to the propoganda and rhetoric? Yes, indeed.-Mach\n\n \n I thought the 'American Dream' was an ideal vehicle to utilize required labor during that past period of high prosperity. They were provided with motivation (higher standard of living), pursuit of belief systems as a structured social outlet and political ideals to feel they had proper representation.

Those former middle classed citizens who now feel their world is falling apart will experience regret that the illusion was never completed, and probably go to their graves lamenting 'the good old days'.",

Assuming that people take that 4% of current social security and invest it, and make an average return of 7% per year (which is average return for low to moderate risk managed fund investment), in only 107 years, they will have enough in their little retirement fund to retire.

   "Than you say in the next post:\n You are not \"getting it\", mach.\n I have often heard people say \"The first million is the hardest, after that it is easy\". This is incorrect. The hardest part of acquiring wealth is recognising and accepting the fact that you have been lied to your entire life. There is only one political party. The little differences that they toss out there for the helots to chew on are nothing, and \"both sides\" are lying to you. Lets take a look at some of the big \"wedge issues\" of late:\n \n\n \n You missed it Daewoo. You confused my statement of \"how the parties message is communicated\" with me thinking a particular political party \"tells the truth\". I never claimed that. I'm talking about the differences in the two parties, in this case, delivery of message. Democracts often go for reasoned arguments. The truth may indeed be exactly opposite of what they preach, however, I do see an enormous difference in the communication methods the two parties use.\n \n I can, and I think anyone can, fairly easily tell two party messages apart, based soley on how they sell their message. You honestly think the current republicans in power communciate their message the same way the average democrat does? I don't. Either way, I don't entertain the fantasy that people on average tell the truth, I'm sure it's clear now.\n \n \n\n Social security:\n You have the republicans saying it is in trouble and they are going to save it by privitization. This is a lie. The privitization wont make anough difference to matter. It will simply pump equity markets.\n The Democrats on the other hand claim there is no problem, and that the trust fund will take care of the situation. This is also a lie. The trust fund is essentially a big IOU that we have no hope of repaying. \n \n \n Get serious for a minute please. You know why republicans want to change it. The party despises entitlements, always have. They want to remove them all. Democracts don't, in fact, they put them in place. The difference is night and day. Whether or not you agree with either of their suggestions, is completely irrelevant. The point is, again, that they are DIFFERENT, MARKEDLY different, that is, COMPLETE OPPOSITES on their philosophy with regards to entitlements.\n \n As to your beating the conservative propoganda drum by claiming it is indeed a crisis, you're not making sense. Please define \"Crisis\". It obviously doesn't make sense given say..oh, our national debt, or maybe the Bush tax cuts, or the medicare problems in comparison...or....why go on?\n \n \n http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_03/b3916024_mz007.htm\n  The net present value of the shortfall in revenues over the next 75 years is $3.7 trillion, only about one-third of the net present value of the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 and about 0.7% of gross domestic product projected for the same period. An immediate payroll tax increase of about 2% would eliminate this gap. So would paring the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 back by less than 50%, and transferring the added revenues to Social Security.\n \n \n \n \nAbortion:\n I can't believe how much time people spend debaitng what is essentially a dead issue. Abortion is here, and is pretty much here to stay, unless the supreme court goes back and essentialy overrules itself. thsi is not going to happen, and both sides know it. It keeps the helots occupied, though, so they pretend it matters,\n\n \n Then you agree the republicans have the opposite view about abortion than democracts support. I agree, it's dumb for fundies to push for this above all the other problems we have in the world, but the key here is the difference in the two parties, and the fact that the side you agree with, low and behold is the democractic position (I'm not a democrat by the way).\n \n Why do the republican fat-cats allow such **** to gain so much publicity? They want to control the helots, and it's what the idiot helots want..their witches and cauldrons and gods of rain. The democracts take the opposite approach, right or wrong, they are quite the opposite.\n \n \nGun control:\n This one is just stupid. The gun control we have now is likely here to stay, and there is not likely to be much more. The powers that be understand that any more restrictions, and the supreme court will have to look at it, and neither side of the isle wants that, since both sides are the same. \n \n Far down on the importance rung....(see below).\n \n \nCreation/evolution\n This one is just stupid. If they want to teach both, who cares? If they want to teach only one, again, who cares? This is nothing but a big ******* match between the fundis and the liberals who are bored enough to feel a need to pick on another persons religon. Pathetic.\n\n Hardly a political platform issue. This issue is about ignorance vs knowledge. It's once again diametric opposition.\n \n -------------------------------------\n \n Ask yourself this. What is the current republican admin prioritizing?\n War\n Privatizing part of social security\n Beating the war drum of christian fundies through Shiavo, Ten Commandmants, abortion, etc.\n \n #1 Do you think democracts would prioritze the same issues? I don't.\n Would they be \"better\" issues? I have no idea, but I'm pretty sure they would be markedly different.\n \n #2 If you do agree they would have different priorities, what exactly is it that you claim makes them \"one party\"? Honestly, what is it? Are they both political parties? Yes. Are they both stiving for power? Yes.\n \n Is that the similarity you're seeing..that they are both political parties?\n \n -Mach",

Further, given the intense competition, predators and prey both become better at their game of survival. \n \n #2 Hide the nature of the predators from them. Make them feel they are safe, secure, living a wonderful existence. Fewer predators, more and more prey, the few predators are fat and happy, and would like nothing more than to stay that way forever.\n \n For every person you keep in the dark, out of the game, unware that they too can be a predator, you both decrease your competition, and increase your supply of prey. A clear win for the minority.\n \n I suspect our two parties might side more for one, than the other.\n \n -Mach",
