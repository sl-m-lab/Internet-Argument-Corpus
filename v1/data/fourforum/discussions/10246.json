The invalidating evidence is voluminous.\n\n \n This is precisely where your delusions and blind prejudice deceives you samiinh. If you understood that humanity is in a spiritual battle against very real forces of darkness who seek to steal our souls from our heavenly Father, then you would know that the other religions on Earth are not belief systems that were founded within the minds of corrupt men only, but were created by the god of this World and are Cults designed to mislead men away from the one true God. I believe Joseph Smith, just like Mohamed were sincere in that they met with Angels who gave them their particular Gospels.\n \n There is just one problem with their beliefs though, and that is that no Angel of God/light would ever create and deliver their own Gospel to Humanity because they know they too are Creatures and not worthy of Worship as only the true Creator is. But remember that Lucifer, also known as the god of this World, the Prince of Darkness, the Father of lies etc. etc. was also the highest Archangel in Heaven before he fell from Grace for attempting to elevate himself to a god for wanting to be worshiped himself. It is he who delivered the false gospel to Joseph Smith and also to Mohamed, and he also created Baal, Budhism, Hinduism, and every other false religion that has ever existed and been forgotten with time as all false belief systems must.\n \n So yes samiinh, I have always condemned cults as false in that they don't worship or glorify the living God, but I have never implied that they don't possess power from the god they worship. It's just that their god is evil, controlling, demonic and leads to ultimate death rather than the God of light and love that Jesus is Messiah of and leads all who believe in Him to.

The accent is on the resulting total deception, or Satan wouldn't appear to be an angel of light.\n \n So my question to you still stands: given that Satan can appear as an angel of light and deceive totally, how do you know whether you experienced an angel of light, or were totally deceived by Satan for his ends?\n \n Secondly, given that in other posts you accuse those who question you of being childish (asking childish questions), why do you appear on debating forums with unprovable claims and assertions? Some of us are trying to engage you, Arch, but at every turn you seem to avoid the issue and post long paragraphs of totally irrelevant evangelising material. I hope you see that we aren't here for that. Play ball, if you'd be so kind. emoticon_xhoho",

And also, you refuse to accept any answer I give you that doesn't jive with what you want to hear. For example, since we're not dealing with a minister of satan who was sent to deceive me but satan himself as appearing as an Angel of light, then he would have used his appearance to fool me. But my Angels never appeared to me at all, only to those who meant me harm. He also would have used his power to lead me into the compromising position only to cause others whom he controlled for evil/violence to finish me off or at least hurt me by attacking me. Yet in both cases I was protected from violence by my Angels. And make no mistake about it, those whom I was protected from did mean me harm, whether it was violence, seduction or potential disease through unsafe sex.\n \n The difference between us and the reason this debate is stacked is because I am attempting to answer you honestly based not on my personal desires but on scriptural principles. With every new post you change the goal posts and redefine your questions in an attempt to stump me. You have no desire to learn the truth but to simply try to make me look like a fool. It make for difficult communication when I know your agenda is not the truth but to mock my beliefs.",

   "I would like to address your statement that one cannot prove or disprove the existance of God. I ask you, \"Who told you that God existed?\". \"Were you born into religion?\" \"Do you know anyone who spoke to God, other than what you have read in the Bible?\" \"Does it not strike you as odd that when someone in our time speaks to God, it is always by himslef with not witnesses?\" \"When was the first Bible written telling stories about a God?\" Have you ever considered that all the stories in the Bible happened thousands of years ago and none since?\" \"Did God simply decide to take a break and not give man the power to part water, build a boat to save the world from his wrath, and all the other stories in the Bible?\" The bible relies on BLIND FAITH. No proof, but simply faith. Logic dictates that there is no God just as your logic today takes the position that all Gods before yours were false. Just my opinion.\n\n \n Not just your opinion. Clearly illogical. The proof of the non existential is impossible. I cannot prove that God exists, that does not mean he does not. To prove the non existence of anything you must prove it in all circumstances for all times for all dimensions for all spacial anomalies etc. It is simply not possible. That is why there are major logical holes here. The thread is based on fallacy. I do not propose that God does exist. I simply point out that it cannot be proven either way. One cannot prove the existence of the fourth dimension either nor can one prove the existence of it. It may only be hypothesized. Good luck on your logical proof.",

   "Interesting thread. I adopt Einstein's position on god. \"I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt by modern science. [He was speaking of Quantum Mechanics and the breaking down of determinism.] My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality.

Of course, if such were treated as the truth it is then ALL is cast into doubt.\n As a representative of evil, I can walk into a church, bath in holy water and openly profess with my mouth that Jesus is the Christ and Lord.\n Something the bible says demons can't do nor can the unsaved.\n \n Of course, being a book of hypocricy, the bible also talks about how false prophets will rise among the believers to deceive and mislead them...\n \n But, Charlie, the key word is APPEARS.\n Appearances are deceptive. \n Thus, from my belief, all the fake erm faith healers are servents of the devil. All they do is give the impression that they've done something when in actuality they did nothing.\n \n This goes many ways.
