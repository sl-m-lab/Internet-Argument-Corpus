   "Amphibians to Reptiles\n \n * Proterogyrinus or another early anthracosaur (late Mississippian) -- Classic labyrinthodont-amphibian skull and teeth, but with reptilian vertebrae, pelvis, humerus, and digits. Still has fish skull hinge. Amphibian ankle. 5-toed hand and a 2-3-4-5-3 (almost reptilian) phalangeal count.\n \n * Limnoscelis, Tseajaia (late Carboniferous) -- Amphibians apparently derived from the early anthracosaurs, but with additional reptilian features: structure of braincase, reptilian jaw muscle, expanded neural arches.\n \n * Solenodonsaurus (mid-Pennsylvanian) -- An incomplete fossil, apparently between the anthracosaurs and the cotylosaurs. Loss of palatal fangs, loss of lateral line on head, etc. Still just a single sacral vertebra, though.\n \n * Hylonomus, Paleothyris (early Pennsylvanian) -- These are protorothyrids, very early cotylosaurs (primitive reptiles). They were quite little, lizard-sized animals with amphibian-like skulls (amphibian pineal opening, dermal bone, etc.), shoulder, pelvis, & limbs, and intermediate teeth and vertebrae. Rest of skeleton reptilian, with reptilian jaw muscle, no palatal fangs, and spool-shaped vertebral centra. Probably no eardrum yet. Many of these new \"reptilian\" features are also seen in little amphibians (which also sometimes have direct-developing eggs laid on land), so perhaps these features just came along with the small body size of the first reptiles.",

   "\"Why are we so quick to believe that a one-of-a-kind, hunch-backed skeleton 400,000 years old is suddenly the \"missing link\"? A few years after this discovery, some different fossils-supposedly one million years old-were found in another part of the world and were called the \"missing link.\" Is there a link between these two links? And where are all of the other missing links? Where is the chain of evidence that shows how the unique parts of creatures evolved? How did the eye develop? How did we get a heart, stomach, other organs, teeth, hearing, smell, nerves, muscles, bones, and skin all in one nice, neat package?\" \n \n Resource: http://www.icr.org/pubs/btg-a/btg-144a.htm\n \n Try explaining that.",

   "Just because they looked like eachother or had amphibian/reptile features DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY ARE LINKS!\n\n \n Ok, so they share characteristics that modern forms have, show a gradual change in a linear sequence and they're not transitional?\n \n For the third time, please, stop dodging the question, what is YOUR definition of a transitional form?\n \n \nThere should be MILLIONS of links between those creatures because they evolved over \"trillions and trillions of years\"\n\n \n This is disingenuous and dishonest. It shows a general lack of knowledge about the process of fossilisation. No Palaeontologist says there should be \"MILLIONS of links\", if they do, provide references. \"Trillions and trillions\" of years is just a flat out lie. Absolutely no-one claims anything like that sort of time scale for the natural history of earth.\n \n \nbut there aren't any! All you can show me are 4 \"links\". Where are the other millions?\n\n \n Well are there 4 or are there none? What about the Archaeopteryx lineage, why do you keep avoiding the question by changing the subject? It's no wonder scientists get annoyed with creationists.",
