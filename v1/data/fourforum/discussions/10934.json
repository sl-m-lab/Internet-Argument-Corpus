That was more than the $17 billion median estimate of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. \n \n Overseas sales grew at the fastest pace in six months as higher export taxes and an appreciating yuan failed to damp demand. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn today reaffirmed a forecast that China's economy will expand 10 percent this year amid a spreading financial crisis sparked by the U.S. housing slump. \n \n ``Global demand is holding up reasonably well,'' said David Cohen, an economist at Action Economics in Singapore. ``The growth momentum in China's economy is sufficient to help balance out whatever is happening in the U.S.'' \n\n \n This is a point I have been trying to make for quite a while. As the US fails, that is GOOD for china because it turns more US consumers into bargain hunters and if you are trying to stretch your dollar, low cost chinese goods are the obvious choice. More detailed data is not yet available, but the trend has been toward increased exports primarily to the US and Europe coupled with greater domestic demand (chinese consumers). \n \n I think that we can pretty much put to bed the idea that the rest of the world is going to bail out the US with this one. Frankly China is holding enough of our dollars that there cannot possibly be any kind of bailout of the US without china on board, and they would be foolish to do that when it very clearly goes against their interests. I also think we can dismiss the idea that the destruction of the US economy would mean the destruction of the world economy. It will certainly lead to some pain, probably long term pain for the eurozone, but assuming the trends we have seen out of Asia and India continue it will not be too long before demand lost in the US is made up in those places.",

Should be interesting to see who else goes this path. \n\n \n I guess what shocks me is not jsut the action, but how blatant the action is. Frankly, it woud be more subtle for the fed to take these assets as long term collateral on debt, essentially monetizing them. If we are going this route instead I have once again underestimated the problem. \n \n This is a license to steal and an admission by the government that they consider the entire financial market a writeoff all rolled into one. Assuming that other mortgage insurers take this same path (and lets face it, they would be stupid not to), trillions of dollars in AAA rated securities would be downgraded to junk overnight. \n \n \nBy the way, when is CitiBank going bankrupt? Have the auditors commented on them being a going concern?\n\n \n Not sure. I actually have an inside guy at citibank but he is not saying ANYTHING. He said they have actually fired a few people due to commnets they have made either via Email or in phone calls from their desks, which would imply that they are listening in on their employees phone calls. I would say that any company that is taking steps like that to enforce silence in their senior staff has got ot be in serious, serious trouble.\n \n The last I heard, they would be crippled but survive as long as credit card spending remianed high and defaults remained low. Looking at the news it would appear that card defaults are shooting through the roof.",
