   "Yeah, I know. We've had our hearts broken so many times. I remember when I used to post regularly in the NYTimes gay rights forum, and we were all so excited about our efforts to elect Al Gore. We thought, well we have been losing on so many fronts with all the DOMA laws being passed by the states, but our hope lies in Al Gore! We gay and bi and trans folks gave him our hearts, thought we had a victory, and then saw it snatched away. Some people said, \"No more with politics! It's just corrupt, and the Republicans will steal any victory we get.\" Others of us were dismayed, but we gradually got over the blow. Then came the war, and we had to mobilize against that. Meanwhile, we began to have some victories, in the courts especially. We had Lawrence v. Texas, which was followed by the court ruling in Massachusetts, where we won marriage rights. \n \n Then came the election of 2004, and again we got our hopes up, only to have them dashed again in November. The gloomy morning after John Kerry's loss seemed to many of us to be the low moment of modern American politics. But we picked ourselves up yet again and went forward. There would be more victories and more losses for our movement for equality. \n \n Now here it is four years later. Bush is really leaving this time. And we have a new opportunity for a new romance with a new leader. Have we been disappointed too many times to love again? \n \n It's clear to me that electing a President will not win us equal rights and fair treatment under the law and in the society. But it can certainly help, especially if the President uses the bully pulpit to support equality. Barack Obama, like Hillary Clinton who lost, has never supported fully equal marriage rights. But there is the possibility, which he has left open. \n \n It strikes me that for many reasons, Barack Obama will be a far better President than John McCain. I think it's time we give our hearts, and our hands, to Barack Obama, not because he will be our savior, but because he can as President help out our movement to win full equality and fair treatment for lgbt people. He won't win those for us, but it will be helpful for us to have a President who supports something close to equality.",

   "Personally, I don't want a 'romance with a leader'. I want someone who will simply lead honestly and not try to over-extend his power. I don't want 'Camelot'. What concerns me about Obama is that many are getting caught up in the fluff of Obama-mania and not looking at policy specifics and accomplishments. He seems to be for civil liberties in some areas and in others it seems he would more likely take them away (such as 2nd amendment rights). And who knows where he stands on national security. I think most people aren't single-issue voters, and neither am I.",

And I was a Hillary Clinton supporter, because I found her to be more specific in what she proposed to do and more experienced than Obama. But given that she will not be the Democratic nominee, we have to assess the relative merits of the two candidates we now have. I disagree with most of what McCain stands for and says he would do in office. I agree more with Obama on the issues than I do with McCain. McCain has far more experience in public office than Obama has, which is a plus in McCain's favor. But my opposition to most of his positions is so strong that it outweighs the experience factor. I am not entirely comfortable with Obama's inexperience, to be honest. But I will support him anyway and work to get him elected. \n \n Since this is the gay rights section of the forums, we should talk about Obama v. McCain on gay rights issues. At least in the past, the two men have taken what have sounded like similar positions on same-sex marriage. But since he began running for President, McCain has been playing more to the religious right and to the right in general than he had previously. I trust Obama to be a friend to gay people and a supporter of equal rights more than I trust McCain to be a supporter of equal rights.",

   "I love Obama. I love to listen to him speak. He has a positive overall tone to his speeches. \n \n But for me Obamas support for the gay community, his anti war stance, and his care for those less fortunate out weigh all other issues.\n He had me with this debate :)\n http://www.youtube.com/v/kDQwa6-KJsI&hl\n http://www.youtube.com/v/zrp-v2tHaDo&hl\n \n I love Obama so much that I would take a bullet for the man.\n \n \n McCain is no supporter of equal rights. He is an enemy to the gay community and seeks our enemies support. He may have not supported the federal marriage amendment but as more states begin to have gay marriage he will call for the amendment.",
