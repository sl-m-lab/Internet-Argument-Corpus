I've read maybe 10 pages and find it interesting from a historical and philosophical perspective, but incredibly unrealistic when it comes down to the actual actions that occur within the book.",

It's a framework from which to launch discussions of various philosophies, and later in the book is used as an example of a philosophy. The presentations of the various philosophies were clear and interesting, and as far as I recall fairly accurate. All in all I'd call it an interesting and accesible introduction to philosophy.",
