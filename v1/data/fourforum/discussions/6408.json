At first, these strikes were in support of the South Vietnamese forces, but later the restrictions against attacking North Vietnam were lifted and the effort changed to that of the interdiction of supply lines. The first of these raids against the North was a raid by 15 B-52Ds on railway yards and oil storage facilities at Vinh. Three days later, the airfields at Bai Thuong were hit. On the weekend of 15-16 April, targets near Hanoi and Haiphong were attacked. By mid-April, virtually all of North Vietnam had been cleared for bombing raids, for the first time in more than 3 years. On May 10, the name of the operation against North Vietnam was changed to Linebacker. \n \n In the meantime, negotiations were underway in Paris between National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and North Vietnamese leader Le Duc Tho, trying to establish some sort of framework under which the US could withdraw from an increasingly unpopular war and still leave some sort of military parity between North and South Vietnam. On October 23, progress in the peace talks in Paris led the US to call off all air operations above the 20th parallel, which put Hanoi and Haiphong off-limits. This effectively halted Linebacker. Unfortunately, this gave the North Vietnamese a breathing spell in order to strengthen their defenses and repair the damage to their key lines of communication.http://www.danshistory.com/vietnam.shtml#line2\n \n\n \n Linebacker II\n \n \n\n Day 11 - Dec. 29, 1972\n Operation LINEBACKER II which had begun on December 18, 1972, had flown over 3,000 sorties in 11 days and dropped nearly 40,000 tons of bombs on a handful of targets scattered in and around the Hanoi and Haiphong area of North Vietnam was nearing completion. December 29, 1972 was the final evening for B-52s to bomb North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Eleven days after the bomber crews had begun this operation America's involvment with the B-52s over North Vietnam was finished. Their mission had been sucessful in obtaining their objective. Peace talks in Paris which had came to a stale mate in October 1972 were resumed on January 8, 1973. In less than 30 days after the final bombs were released from the B-52s Le Duc Tho and Henry Kissinger reached a final agreement to end the hostilities between the two nations and obtain the release of America's Prisoners of War. Le Duc Tho and Henry Kissinger signed the Paris Peace Accords on January 27, 1973. Within 60 days after the signing 591 American Prisoner's of War were released and returned to the United States. \n http://members.aol.com/dpoole1272/home/day11.htm\n \n",

   "The bombing of N. Vietnam brought them back to the Paris peace talks. That is well-documented fact. Extrapolate that to continuous shock and awe type bombings and I don't think that N. Vietnam would have been able to sustain a war in the south while defending the North against such an onslaught.\n The relationship between Operation Linebacker II and our withdrawal is simple. Force NV to the table, sign an agreement and get the Hell out. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n See above\n \n The relationship was in mass bombing causing the civilian population to lose its will to support war. The two nukes took the place of several saturation bombing campaigns and showed Japan that we could inflict the same effect as saturation bombing with only ONE plane. If you don't think that had a sobering effect on the Japanese public support for continuing the war, you're wrong. The peace movement grew exponentially in a matter of days post-bombs.\n And I've already talked about the effect of the V weapons on the UK. I wish that I remembered the title of the book that I read on the use of the V weapons against the UK. IT gave very specific detail on the movement of UK airwings towards defensive positions as well as documenting the extreme amount of bombers dedicated to nothing but knocking out V-weapon launch sites. It literally consumed the bulk of England's airforce, leaving the US' air force to carry out the bulk of other missions.\n\n \n You certainly have a typical American Patriot's myopic view of history by attributing our withdrawal from Vietnam to bombing exercises. Do you also discount Russia's WW2 contribution? Incidentally, England did the daylight bombing of German cities, US at nights. For another history lesson as an addition to your rocketry hobby:\n \n ~Starting in June, 1944, Germany fired 9,521 V-I/2 bombs on southern England, of that number under 1,000 being the V2. Of these 4,621 were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire or by RAF fighters such as the new turbojet fighter, the Gloster Meteor. An estimated 6,184 people were killed by these flying bombs. By August only 20 per cent of these bombs were reaching England.~ \n \n If you study WW2 allied air operations, V1/2 launch sites (those that weren't on rail cars) were always a secondary bombing target. The rail cars were targets of opportunity for fighter aircraft but generally remained in tunnels or on sidings under camouflage during daylight hours. Both V1/2 were being manufactured at Peenem\u00fcnde with slave labor, which was subjected to intensive bombing because it was also the center for German advanced weapons and rocketry development including the V series as thoroughly described in many history books and von Braun's career.",

By August only 20 per cent of these bombs were reaching England.~ \n\n To the best of my knowledge, not ONE V-2 was shot down. The Allieds didn't possess the ability to hit a supersonic target going straight down. \n \n\n If you study WW2 allied air operations, V1/2 launch sites (those that weren't on rail cars) were always a secondary bombing target. \n\n Well, you forced me to find the book. It's called \"Impact: The History of Germany's V-Weapons in World War II by Benjamin King (former Command Historian of the US Army Transportation Center, Fort Eustis and Timothy Kutta, former Marine officier and freelance writer specializing in military affairs.\n \n Not true, p168 \"During the month of january, ski sites became the sole mission of the Ninth Air Force and of the 1146 sorties that tooki off from their airfields, 802 actually reached the target. Unable to bomb targets in Germany due to bad weather, the Eighth Air Force added its weight to the attacks near the French coast. In January it launched large raids on four days for a total of 1444 sorties, 1034 of which found their targets. \"\n So saying that V1/2 sites were secondary targets is just plain false. \n \n\n The rail cars were targets of opportunity for fighter aircraft but generally remained in tunnels or on sidings under camouflage during daylight hours. Both V1/2 were being manufactured at Peenem\u00fcnde with slave labor, which was subjected to intensive bombing because it was also the center for German advanced weapons and rocketry development including the V series as thoroughly described in many history books and von Braun's career.\n\n \n \n \n Chapt. 12, The Reckoning\n \n\n In their short operational life, the V-weapons accomplished a great deal. In the air they forced the Allies to divert thousands of aircraft and and hundreds of thousands of tons of bombs in an unsuccessful attempt to stop them. On the ground the Allies committed over 2500 antiaircraft guns, more than two hundred of the world's most advanced radar sets and over a quarter of a million men and women to protect London and Antwerp. Operationally, the V-sites in France were a major objective of the Allied armies in Normandy. Field Marshall Montgomery was compelled to include neutralization of the V-sites in Holland as part of his plan to seize a bridge over the Rhine, and his ill-conceived attack failed. The V-weapon assault on the Port of Antwerp curtailed the port's activities and forced the Allies to open the port of Ghent.\n \n\n \n Now, I don't know about your knowledge of history, but that clearly demonstrates a major effort by the Allies to counter the V-weapons. Incidentally, the bridge was the \"Bridge too Far\" that the movie was made about.\n \n Further on, they state:\n \n\n On the strategic level, no other German weapon prompted the formation of a cabinet level organization like the Crossbow Committee. \n",

   "Might I suggest that you do some reading up on British anti-V weapon startegies. You'll see that more air defenses and fighters were committed to preventing V's from hitting the UK than were allocated to fighting the war.\n\n \n A rather nebulous statement considering air defenses were dual role- interceptors and flak batteries had to be maintained anyway to fend off incursions by the Luftwaffe into UK airspace, they just required tweaking to counter V-1's. I'd suggest you read up on the nature of air defenses and interceptors- off course more are going to be employed over the UK than elsewhere, in the same way the majority of Bomber Command wa employed in the stategic bombing campaign.\n \n \nIn terms of body count, the V weapons were not effective, but the effect it had on the population was devastating. They truly were considered terror weapons.\n\n \n You again overstate their effect, and as I said earlier they never empitied London of most of its population. I'd also suggest you read Albert Speer's biography for an inside view on the colossal utilisation of resources the V-2 programme alone represented- everything considered their effect was minimal considering what they cost to develop.\n \n \nThe A-bomb's effect on Japan was the primary thesis of my reply to georged. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Who has already pointed out the inconsistent nature of that arguement.",

(more stats: Feb 1994 - the 9th flew 12 attacks against launch sites using 2311 aircraft; the 9th used 1341 out of 1741 total heavy bombers to bomb launch sites.)
