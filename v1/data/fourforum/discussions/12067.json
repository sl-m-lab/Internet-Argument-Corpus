   "The fact is that the oppositions argument isn't a revisionist argument at all.\n\n And thus another person demonstrates that they don't understand what the core of the California \"revision vs amendment\" argument is all about in the first place.\n Moreover, time and time again people approach this issue with THEIR PERSONAL understandings, instead of taking into perspective the California legal landscape.\n If somebody were to stand up in front of the California court and IGNORE the previous ruling and refuse to take into account its implications in this issue, it would be to their detriment.\n \n \n \nIt is the homosexuals argument which plays on terms like equality and discrimination which is the the revisionist argument.\n\n No. That is not \"the revisionist argument\".\n THIS is what is being talked about regarding \"revision vs amendment\"\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/11930-prop-8-revision-amendment.html#post332264\n \n \n \nThe reason that's the case is because there are many limitations on marriage but only homosexuals claim they are being discriminated against.\n\n And if you rewind a little over 40 years, the exact same thing could be said about interracial marriage.\n Archie's reply is a non-argument, and false at that.\n Multiple other groups state discrimination in marriage, but there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS prohibiting their marriage.\n Little things like child rape, lack of consent, and other issues.\n \n \n \nAnd these limitations were never created to discriminate against homosexuals at all since they have existed as long as the concept of traditional marriage has existed in this Country.\n\n That is actually irrelevant.\n Just because a discriminatory practice was put into place without the express desire of discrimination does not mean anything about the validity of the discrimination.\n That's like saying \"Oh. We didn't mean for Jim Crow laws to discriminate against blacks, so it's okay!\"\n \n And more to the claim being made, what an absurd claim.\n If one looks at the chronology of the \"gay marriage laws / amendments\", one easily can see that it was a direct response to Lawrence v Texas. When sodomy laws were removed from the books, so was the \"legitimate state interest\" prohibiting gays from marrying.\n \n If one would stop and THINK, the legitimate state interest against pedophile \"marriage\" is that pedophilia is illegal.\n But when \"sodomy\" laws were repealed, the anti-gay activists lost their legitimate state interest. (Ignoring for the moment that sodomy laws didn't have a legitimate state interest in the first place...)\n \n All these things that the regular anti-gay poster on these boards ignores are inter-connected. There is a method behind the approach being used, both on the pro-gay and the anti-gay side.\n \n \n \nOnly in this generation of militant homosexual aggression is the traditional definition of marriage under attack as a tactic in order to normalize the homosexual lifestyle from a public policy perspective. Once marriage is redefined for homosexuals, then homosexuality itself will be perceived as right and normal as heterosexuality is and that is one of the main moral boundaries which traditionalists oppose crossing. \n\n It doesn't matter how many times Archie's claim is proven false, he repeats it ad nausieum.\n \n Archie? MASSACHUSETTS.\n Gay marriage is legal there. Has been for some time.\n Do you really believe that \"homosexuality itself is perceived as right and normal as heterosexuality\" in the state of Massachusetts???\n The obvious answer is no.\n \n Can you show me ANY Christian who will think \"Oh. Gay marriage is legal now? That must mean it's now okay.\"\n NO.\n \n YOUR FEAR is irrational.\n \n \n \nThe fact is that homosexuals have the same right to marry that straights have.\n\n Again, this claim is like saying \"There are laws outlawing Jewish symbology jewelry. But Jews can wear a Christian Cross necklace just like Christians can. Ergo, we all have the same right!\"\n \n \n \nIt is special rights which they seek to impose by redefining marriage.\n\n It is a \"special right\" for marriage to cater exclusively to straights, but never to give any benefits to gays.\n \n \n \nAnd once they accomplish that special right, according to the American legal process, every other non traditional marriage interest will have a precedent setting case law in which to justify their own reason for having a non traditional marriage.\n\n This has repeatedly been explained to Archie for why this is false.\n \"other non traditional marriage interests\" have LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS against them.\n \n Archie (and some who think like him) love to deceitfully pretend that MAKING THE ARGUMENT is all that is relevant.\n But that's grotesquely false.\n Discriminating against gays has NO \"legitimate state interest\".\n Never has. Never will.\n \n Preventing child rape and pedophile marriage HAS a legitimate state interest. PROTECTION OF THE CHILD who is harmed by pedophilia.\n We could go down the list for other \"non traditional marriage interests\" and why they similarly fail.\n In fact, WE HAVE gone down the list, but Archie cowardly ducks the argument.\n \n \n \nFor a great fictional, yet totally realistic example of this slippery slope in action, watch last nights episode of Boston Legal. Denny and Allan fight a homosexual group in court for the right to marry even though they aren't gay. It's interesting to see the gay lawyer's attempt to imposes the same prejudices on Allan and Denny which homosexuals are currently accusing the straight community of imposing on them. Again, the double standard in their thinking is blinding in its hypocrisy.\n\n I submit to the court that this is another sign of Archie's delusional nature.\n He thinks TV proves his point...\n \n Archie, does ANYBODY HERE HAVE the opinion of the \"homosexual group\" shown in that TV show?\n Does ANY GAY GROUP OUT THERE actually have that opinion?\n I'm going to watch it tonight anyways, so it would be wise if you didn't try to lie.\n (As if you'll even answer the question in the first place...",

Would you care to look at how the 14th amendment has been applied over its history?\n\n \n I'm really not sure how you disagreed with me. You realize that the Fourteenth Amendment was not in the original ratification, right? \n \n \nIn doing so, you have just castrated the power of the court to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority. By your response, the court's decision must match the majority. And as already noted, it's the MAJORITY THAT WANTS the discrimination in the first place.\n\n \n Yes, that's true. If the majority places discriminations in place and the Court is bound to enforce the law as written, then the Court is bound to enforce that discrimination. That is democracy, and that is the rule of law. If we choose to undermine that democracy, which we have done, we have to be very careful where that leads. What we end up with is less and less of a representative democracy.\n \n Who has the power at the end of it? Certainly not \"the people\".",
