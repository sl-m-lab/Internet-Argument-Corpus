I don't mean to imply it referencing the 700 wives thing as it only states that Soloman wasn't leading a good life.\n\n Let's look at the full context...\n \n 1Ki 11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, [and] Hittites;\n 1Ki 11:2 Of the nations [concerning] which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: [for] surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.\n 1Ki 11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.\n \n 1Ki 11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, [that] his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as [was] the heart of David his father.\n 1Ki 11:5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.\n 1Ki 11:6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as [did] David his father.\n 1Ki 11:7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that [is] before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. \n \n These passages in context clearly establish that the sin (that was not like his father David) was in FALSE GOD WORSHIP.\n Loving STRANGE women. Not \"multiple\" women, which is actually something David did as well.\n Verse 2 EXPLICITLY references what God had ACTUALLY said not to do, and then Solomon VIOLATED that command.\n \n \n What we have here is a son driving home after school and running several red lights. The father grounds the kid for running the red lights.\n And along comes somebody else trying to implicate it was the \"driving home after school\" which was the problem. Ignoring the fact that the other family sons / daughters do it without problem, and that when the father was talking about the grounding he explicitly referenced running the red lights.",

Please, let me know if you disagree at this point . . . \n \n Let's skip forward a bit to Deuteronomy 21\n \n The Right of the Firstborn \n 15 If a man has two wives, and he loves one but not the other, and both bear him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love, 16 when he wills his property to his sons, he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn, the son of the wife he does not love. 17 He must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double share of all he has. That son is the first sign of his father's strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him.\n \n See how there is a law specifically about what to do if you have two wives. Hang on, I hear you cry, it doesn't say that god approves of this man having two wives. You're right, but don't you think god might have mentioned a note of disapproval at this point when specifically dealing with the subject. Or perhaps it just slipped his mind.\n \n Personally, I would regard making laws that deal specifically with polygamy (okay bigamy), without mentioning any disapproval, as tacet approval.

How the Israelites had to go to OTHER PEOPLE'S CAMPS, killing off the men and non-virgin women, in order to kidnap their virgin daughters to force them to be \"wives\"...\n Israelites killing off other nations so they can take women as \"wife\" hostages is a repeated anthem in the Old Testament.\n \n It's similar (regarding the driving force of the situation) to a phenomenon we see in MODERN society which involves MODERN polygamy. The \"Lost Boys\" where the boys are KICKED OUT of the polygamous society cause there aren't enough wives to go around.\n Cause when you grow up in a (roughly) 1:1 ratio of men:women, and then you marry off in 1:3+, you will get men who don't have any women.\n \n It's just that the Hebrew God thought it was much more moral to tell his guys to just go around and kill off neighboring village men instead, to make up for the fact that polygamy leaves a shortage of wives for men ????\n \n Repeating the question, HOW is polygamy an answer to an assumed situation where women are seen as inferior???\n For that assumption, man marrying a woman and her being subservient to him? Conceivable.\n POLYGAMY? Not a real consequence/solution of that assumption.\n \n \n \nWe have to get away from looking at the Bible void of historical context, which I see a lot of when it comes to critics of religion.

And if there is a legitimate state interest for not recognizing a right, then it is possible for the government to discriminate.\n WITHOUT a legitimate state interest, the government SHOULD NOT have the power to discriminate.\n \n THAT is what \"marriage rights\" are about.\n So when you refer to gays and \"real marriage rights\" in the future, please be more forthright in admitting what our REAL issues are...",

It was a very NORMAL practice then, and some progressives have no problem with polygamy TODAY. So the whole argument that uses polygamy against Christians is pretty specious.

Heck, what are you gonig to do with the Mormons who have had no problem continuing the practice in some cases?

There shouldn't be an expectation on people to have to admit the obvious. The MORE important point is that if God had no problem with polygamy, it pretty much makes the Bowers-video moot in terms of using THAT particular attack of hypocrisy against Christians. He doesn't seem to have condemned cases of more than two people in a marriage, in the Bible. He DID clearly condemn cases of two people of the same gender in sexual relationships. \n Big whoop.",

   "Um ... no, it means that aspect of marriage wasn't particularly important to him. So what?\n\n Your logic is amusing, but the conclusion is agreed upon.\n Primarily cause there isn't any way to dispute it without chasing your tail.\n God didn't care about polygamy.

And then insisting the police can't act upon that...\n :xbanghead\n \n The point is simple.\n If YOU for ONE SECOND think that \"God\" taking that (supposed) approach has any credibility or intelligence, then you have to question why he didn't do the same for other, MORE PRESSING issues like I described.\n \n \"Kids are going to have sex anyway\".\n AND GOD STILL SAYS IT IS WRONG.\n So why is polygamy so different that he would abstain from saying it was wrong, since you just tried to use the \"they were going to do it anyways\" argument... :xbanghead\n \n As for my side of things? I'll address it while you refuse to address yours.\n POLYGAMY HARMS PEOPLE.\n Consensual sex does not. Sex (barring pedophilia, age of consent laws, and other extreme examples) should not be illegal.\n The difference is that one is legal, and the other is not.\n \n \n \nNo, slavery falls under the oppression thing. It's MUCH easier to condemn in terms of the Bible. \n\n Brigid already beat me to that punch, and it was a knock-out.\n As much as you don't want to admit it, your God was happy to hand out double-standards and favoritism for his Israelites.\n \"Thou shalt not kill.... except when I tell you to wipe out entire races of people\"\n God established two different types of slavery. One for Hebrew slaves, which was to work off debt and treated 'nicely'.\n One for the non-Hebrew slaves, who were treated as property. \"Oppression\" was never a concept applied to them in the bible.\n \n \n \nDude, I said nothing of the sort, nor was I implying anything of the sort.\n\n The problem here is that you've left a ridiculously unexplained gap in your argument.\n WHY were the women of yesteryear incapable of equality and equal protection under the law, while the women of today are (presumably) capable and deserving of equal protection under the law?\n \n You give no explanation, so here's your chance.\n Why do I feel you're going to cut and paste around that?\n \n \n \nNo one here has argued it was THE solution. It was a way society dealt with the problem of women not having support unless they were married, and God allowed it to happen. \n\n :xbanghead\n This is like saying \"Well, the blacks would be lynched if they didn't have somebody to protect them, so of course they needed a white owner\".\n You are claiming a \"solution\" to a problem, when the problem has not been addressed.\n The PROBLEM was the bible's misogyny towards women, which REFUSED TO LET THEM HAVE support outside man's existence.\n If women could have owned land and worked for a living, they could have SUPPORTED THEMSELVES.\n \n It's like saying God \"allowed\" slavery to avoid lynchings, ignoring the fact that it's a situation of INVOKING a problem, to avoid another problem WHICH STILL EXISTS.\n \n \n \nLook, the issue here is that the video raises polygamy as if it's some sort of hypocritical problem.\n\n \"hypocritical problem\"?\n No. You have missed the point.\n It is NOT \"polygamy\" which is the hypocritical problem.\n \n The \"hypocritical problem\" lies in THE PEOPLE who say \"I want a traditional marriage\", but then REFUSE to recognize what the \"traditions\" actually are.\n The \"hypocritical problem\" lies in THE PEOPLE who say \"I want a bible based marriage\", but then REFUSE to recognize what the Bible actually did for marriage.\n \n THAT is the \"hypocritical problem\".\n \n \n \nIf you have a problem with inequality between the sexes, then take that issue up.\n\n I have a problem with using your claims of \"inequality between the sexes\" as an issue JUSTIFYING polygamy.\n YOU are the one making that claim, so I take it up with you.\n Sound appropriate?\n \n \n \nHeck, what are you gonig to do with the Mormons who have had no problem continuing the practice in some cases?\n\n Yeah. You really don't get what we're really saying.\n The Mormons would be LESS hypocritical, and more consistent with keeping with \"traditional / biblical\" marriages.\n That's what I say about them.\n \n \n \nSo you sure can't call them hypocritical (when they've clearly EMBRACED God's allowance for polygamy), and they're among your biggest \"pro-family\" groups.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Oh Joshie.\n This is but ONE of MULTIPLE problems with the \"anti-gay marriage\" crew.\n And the consistent solution is often worse than the inconsistent one. \n \n Take \"pro-life\" for example.\n Some people want refuse embryotic stem cell research because of fears of \"killing\" embryoes.\n It's inconsistent in that these particular embryoes are going in the trash anyways.\n So the options are either a) benefit people through scientific endeavors, or b) go in the trash.\n Now, a REAL and CONSISTENT look at \"pro-life\" would want to PREVENT those embryoes from being disposed of in the first place.\n They would want to attack the SOURCE of disposing those embryoes. The IVF clinics\n But the inconsistent ones don't.\n Some consistent ones DO want to ban IVF, but it's like a hydra.\n Show yourself consistent, and now you've created a new enemy in parents who NEED IVF to procreate. emoticon_xgood\n \n Likewise with the \"polygamy\" groups.\n Sure, they are \"consistent\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n But let's look at the \"family values\" in their consistency.\n Ever hear of \"The Lost Boys\"? These polygamous groups have to KICK BOYS OUT to maintain their high female to male ratios.\n Their \"family values\" lead them to KICKING OUT their sons.\n Great \"family values\", huh...\n \n You want to know what the real solution to all this is? It's a bitter pill.\n Admit the bible is screwed up and stop trying to take your moral cues from thousands of years old goat-herders who thought poly-fabric clothing was bad.\n \n \n \nI didn't say it was the IDEAL solution. (An ideal solution would have been a perfect society to begin with, but then humankind would be some kind of automaton thing) But clearly, when more women can marry a man in a patristic society, it means more women are not out on the street with no means of support.

I just killed this hooker and we've got a witness\"\n \"Okay Mark. So let's kill the witness.\"\n \n \n \nFoundit, there's no \"admitting\" to something I never saw a problem with to begin with.\n\n Jyoshu, there IS \"admitting\" to something that I haven't seen admitted here before.\n Simple enough, right?\n \n \n \nThere shouldn't be an expectation on people to have to admit the obvious.\n\n :xbanghead\n ROFLMAO! OMG! That's funny.\n Jyoshu, I have been carrying on a conversation with Steeeeve who has been saying that God opposes polygamy.\n I have REPEATEDLY had conversations with apologists who proclaim that God had a problem with polygamy.\n So, in my experience, I WISH there shouldn't be an expectation.\n But there is a REASON for why I see it as a big deal!\n \n \n \nThe MORE important point is that if God had no problem with polygamy, it pretty much makes the Bowers-video moot in terms of using THAT particular attack of hypocrisy against Christians.\n\n Yeah.

No-one is saying otherwise. I suppose we should also throw out all the writings of Thomas Jefferson too as a founder of the American republic, as he also owned slaves and therefore participated in such a system.

I would hope you would.\n \n Furthermore, it is clear that God has allowed humankind as a whole to make their choices and build the human society, warts and all. That includes slavery, as well as many other ills. An omnipotent God could indeed, I suppose, snap his fingers and force some instant magical sudden sea-change where slavery somehow goes from being widespread to being non-existent, but that would take away the free-will of human beings. THAT's what I meant earlier by God not imposing, which you guys misunderstood and jumped on. No, he works within the system human society built for itself, warts and all. An analogy of this concept today is that prisons are pretty terrible places too, sometimes, but there are still laws today that require people to go to prison--even though they may be killed there in gang violence, get raped, etc. Do you also think modern day judges should stop sending people to prisons because it can be a horrible place? \n \n \nBut make no mistake. You ARE IGNORING A SIGNIFICANT and VERY REAL lesson of \"slavery is okay\" that DOES exist in the bible.\n\n \n So when Thomas Jefferson didn't get rid of his slaves and participated in that society and system by buying them, you consider him to be teaching a lesson, saying \"slavery is okay\"? emoticon_wow",

Again, you need to take into account other parts of the book if you're going to make conclusions about the book in general, rather than ONLY those two verses.\n I gave you a heck of a lot more than two verses, Jyoshu.\n \n \n\n No one is claiming the Bible didn't say ...\n \"No Pork.\n Punish Gays for having gay sex.\n You shall not kill.\n Stone children that badmouth you.\n You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, land, property, etc..\n Don't eat shellfish.\n Leave those women alive if they are vigins and take them as sex slaves.\n Don't look back at Sodom and Gomorrah.\n Don't eat from the Tree. \"No one is saying these things don't exist in scripture. \n\n I KNOW no one is saying that. I never implied anyone was. You really don't get what I posted that list for, do you? You really didn't grasp it?\n \n I posted it to show that God (in your BIBLE) DOES enforce \"his will in many, many areas on the people of Biblical times\", thus making your incredulity over God enforcing it in the area of slavery rather absurd.\n \n Just as easy as it was for God to enforce his will with all of the above, all he had to do was say: You shall not own slaves. Simple as that, Jyoshu.\n \n INSTEAD, he not only allows them to have slaves, BUT TELLS THEM WHERE TO GET THEM.\n \n That's like me, a cop, not only allowing a group of bank robbers to walk right past me, but then POINTING OUT A CAR SOMEONE LEFT RUNNING THAT THEY CAN USE TO GET AWAY!\n \n \n \n \nNo one is saying the Bible as a whole doesn't have inconsistencies. You two are spending an ENORMOUS amount of effort arguing very obvious matters against someone who is COMPLETELY aware of them and the inconsistencies they pose. But I'm not going to come to conclusions about God or the Bible as a whole based on ONLY these few verses when there are other verses that give a much different perspective. I'll take ALL of them into account, thank you, rather than just the ones you guys are cherry-picking.\n\n Given that you have not provided such verses, I really could care less if you claim we are \"cherry-picking\". All that matters is that God DID condone slavery, and instructed them how to take slaves.\n \n As simple as it was to say \"you shall not murder\", he could have said \"You shall not keep slaves\"\n \n \n\n That sort of mentality assumes God and humans are on the same level. They aren't. God can do what he wants--he's GOD, remember?\n\n Yes, he can. That doesn't make him RIGHT. Foundit beat me to the youtube link - take a good listen to it and really really think carefully about the analogy there.\n \n \n \n Humans are to obey God when he tells those humans to do something. You might as well be arguing that a father should be a teetotaler just because he tells his teenage son not to have go out and get drunk.\n\n If that father claims to be perfect, then yes.\n \n \nAgain ... doesn't take into account that one party here has an omniscient perspective, while the other doesn't. If one party has complete insight into the entire future events and actions of a given group, it completely changes the situation. If you KNEW ahead of time that the 30-year old Hitler was going to do years later what he would go on to do, then you'd be pretty immoral to NOT make sure he was either taken out or put as far down the social ladder of society as possible (why gee, in Bible times, the lowest rung was slavery/servitude!) that he couldn't rise to where he could commit his atrocities, right?? I would hope you would.\n\n Well then, funny how your omnicient and all-powerful God DIDN'T do so........ \n \n You just shot yourself in your own foot, Jyoshu. \n \n And no, I'd just, if I was your God, prevent the particular sperm and egg from joining, not kill him (or make sure he was taken out) or make sure he's low down on the social ladder *shrugs*. Simple as that.\n \n You yourself realize, with your above statement about Hitler, however unconsciously, that you are more moral than your own God (or rather than what your Bible says about your God and you believe).\n \n \nFurthermore, it is clear that God has allowed humankind as a whole to make their choices and build the human society, warts and all. That includes slavery, as well as many other ills.\n \n See the above list that you quoted to see how much bunk this argument is. Sure he's (if he existed) allowed bad things to happen, etc. But HE INTERVENED AND ENFORCED HIS WILL, giving them commands (certainly doesn't sound like letting them build their own society.......). W\n \n hy no command against slavery? Don't you think that's be a bit more important than wearing mixed-thread clothes or eating shellfish? Did he just not \"get\" to the slavery section of his law-books when he was shoving laws into your Bible's Hebrew society?\n \n \n \nSo when Thomas Jefferson didn't get rid of his slaves and participated in that society and system by buying them, you consider him to be teaching a lesson, saying \"slavery is okay\"? emoticon_wow\n\n \n If you show Thomas Jefferson (who, by the way, is never claimed to be perfect, all powerful, or anything) instructing the people where and how to get their slaves and which slaves are okay to keep for life and pass down as property and which slaves you should only keep for a certain amount of time, then yes, I would consider him to be teaching a lesson, saying \"slavery is okay\".\n \n So, I'll be waiting until you find that!",

There are plenty of Christians here who would happily explain to you that God told HUMANS not to do something, but he never said it applied to himself.\n \n Secondly, way to take the statement out of context...\n Those last two/one commandment(s) read \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's ...\"\n God talked about not coveting WHAT BELONGS TO OTHER PEOPLE.\n \n Here, you talk about God coveting something you admit belongs to him anyways???\n :xbanghead\n \n Either your knowledge of the bible is insufficient, so you didn't realize the commandment in question specifies coveting THY NEIGHBOR's property, or you were purposely leaving that out...\n \n \n \nSpeaking of \"sin\", an ignorant description ....\n\n I see no way in which those comments apply.\n They aren't replying to anything I said.\n They aren't applicable to anything I said.\n Moving on...\n \n \n \nAnd this is where you anti-Christ's ...\n\n \"you anti-Christ's\"???\n ROFLMAO!!!\n \n Actually, it's more an issue where I take issue with some of Jesus's followers.\n I personally think this world would be a lot better place if his followers would actually try to behave like him.\n Too often, they ignore his words and take comments out of \"Leviticus\" for their personal action cues...\n \n \n \nAnd this is where you anti-Christ's get your britches in a tissy.

Stop pretending that me violating one of their commandments somehow justifies discrimination based solely on a religious justification without a secular one.\n \n \n \nAnd this is a \"simple truth\" because YOU say so? This was not a \"simple truth\" 200 years ago in this country.\n\n I'm sorry, but WHAAAA????\n \n Are you telling me that 200 years ago, my statements of \"Forced slavery is wrong. It is wrong to \"own\" another human being.\" were actually inaccurate?\n \n Now please understand that I am not talking about POPULAR OPINION here. I am not talking about whether people back then WANTED slavery to be legal, and whether their PERSONAL OPINIONS were that it was okay.\n I am talking about how regardless of the time, slavery is wrong.\n \n If YOUR PERSONAL OPINION is that slavery was okay 200 years ago, then please let me know and we can go from there.\n Again, I am not talking about what PEOPLE AT THAT TIME thought, but rather YOUR belief on the issue.\n (for example, if you had lived 200 years ago, your personal morality would hold that it would be okay to own a slave)\n \n \n \nThe fact is every great civilization has had some component of slavery in its economic makeup and just because we have \"evolved\" into a more civilized society, does not mean that God puts a greater value on life now then He did 2000 years ago.\n\n So it's humans who have evolved, and not God.\n Interesting. I have a similar position that some Christians object to.\n \n \n \nBTW we still have slavery.., we just call it \"illegal immigration\".\n\n If that comment was intended to be humorous, I find it in poor taste.\n If it was intended to be factual, you really don't understand what \"slavery\" is...\n \n \n \nNasty? In the Penguin thread didn't you just call homosexuals, and I quote \"British cigarattes\"? \n\n Not only that, he thought it was a demonstration of having a spine to use that word...\n Perhaps his definition of \"nasty\" is contingent on how is the recipient of the abuse?",

If your point involves no value judgement on the situation, I could care less that you consider it such.

As Steeeeve tried to explain to you, you're taking something and extrapolating it as being ok for all people everywhere.\n \n \nI am not advocating ignoring the rest of the book.\n\n \n Then why are you doing it? Because you clearly aren't taking it into account.\n \n \nNo Dorothy. Don't look behind the curtain at all.\n Just trust what the wizard is telling you to believe...\n\n \n Like adhering the generalization that the Bible says slavery is ok? Umm hmm.\n \n \nWhich brings us back to the bible's CONTRADICTORY NATURE.\n\n \n Only for those who want to fixate on that. Some of us understand the Bible has contradictions, and understand that completely. Did you actually think you're telling me something I didn't already know? 'Cause frankly, I'm probably more familiar with Biblical contradictions than you are, Foundit.\n \n \nYOU want to fixate on passages that say it's wrong to oppress others, TO IGNORE the examples of the bible telling the Jews to oppress others.\n\n \n Who cares???\n I suppose you'd rather me \"fixate\" on passages that are focused on what YOU want to fixate on here? Nah... I'm not out to try and find guilt with the Bible. If that's what you want to be about, knock yourself out. Your crusade.\n \n \nadmit the contradiction.\n\n \n Dude, I've long done that. \n And you were harping in \"reading comprehension\" ....\n \n \nYou're not even saying anything.

I don't CARE whether or not you think it's \"rectified.\" I'm simply telling you how it is. Whether or not you are willing to see the reality that it does BOTH is up to you. \n \n \nThe passages on how it is OKAY to own people have already been quoted by Brigid.\n Leviticus 25:44-46, for example.

Someone was inspired by God to write them.\n \n \nemoticon_wow\n Wow dude.\n Have you ever met Christians?\n\n \n So much for trying to avoid generalization, eh ... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nFOPIOI?\n Or is it more an issue where YOU SINGULARLY are wasting an enormous amount of effort ignoring the REAL POINT of our replies.\n\n \n If I though the \"real point\" of your replies really mattered, sure. \n Frankly, I don't. The issue of contradictions in the Bible is something I accepted and worked through DECADES ago. It's completely understandable to anyone who understands the Bible was written by many different people from different perspectives. Sometimes it seems it's critics are more fundamentalist in their criticisms than its adherents.\n \n \nThe bible has multiple passages that are okay with slavery.\n\n \n Meh. \n It also has multiple passages about treating people justly and with love. (shrug)\n \n \nSecondly, how is that not like the example I gave?\n The kids and their father ARE on separate levels, right?\n From the perspective of the kids, can't the father do what he wants?\n \n But the REAL difference is that from a MORALISTIC society, we hold the father to standards that you REFUSE to hold God to.\n You are incapable of observing that God is flawed.\n\n \n Sorry, but God can indeed do what he wants. He's not beholden to your views of how he should act, and the difference there between an omniscient God and humans is so enormous, any analogy you put forward trying fit BOTH under a moralistic standard is woefully inadequate. The one who's commands DETERMINE morality isn't bound by some outside standard. The idea that HE'S bound by the standard he places on humans isn't even valid.\n \n Bottom line: Look, no one's making you embrace the Bible or any other religious text.

Obviously, the Desmond Tutus' and ML King Jr's and Mel Whites' found something noble and good in its pages.

Because THAT'S the sort of silly logic you're employing here. \n \n \nThe bible instructs people on the proper way to own a slave.\n You want to ignore the implicit lesson in that. I get that.\n\n \n No, you clearly aren't getting it, at least what's important here. What you're doing is like someone saying that the Bible tells us to forgive our enemies, and then turning right around and claiming such a statement ACTUALLY means it's ok to be someone's enemy. That the Bible SUPPORTS being someone's enemy. You just aren't getting it.\n \n \nI don't think you appreciate the significance of it.\n Contradictions demonstrate that the bible is errant.\n\n \n I already said here that I'm no inerrantist. That a book with that many authors from that many contexts and perspectives has errors doesn't really matter to me; it's completely expected.

There's a narrative where God tells the Israelites to go get slaves. For a more general admonition, it does tells how to deal with slaves in the culture and in fact in the NT tells to treat them well. You're acting like an over-zealous prosecutor here trying to implicate someone by pulling things out of context and time-frame. Your applying 'do-you-beat-you-wife' type of tactics to the Bible here, and anyone other than you and fundies knows that it's too complex of an issue for that.\n \n \nAgain, you spend an awful lot of time on things you say don't matter...\n You protest WAYYY too much, and WAYYYY too loudly.\n\n \n You're getting into FOPIOI territory here. Particularly ironic since you're the one trying to make such a big deal here about the Bible and slavery.\n \n \nDo you realize that the people at the time didn't see a contradiction?\n Just like people didn't see a contradiction between \"all people are created equal\", but then counted black slaves as 3/5 of a person?\n \n But again, you ignore the ORIGINAL mentality of the authors where you want to, don't you... In the end, the rational recourse is to think for yourself.\n\n \n (Shrug) Just like Jefferson and many of our founding fathers of the republic. Funny though, that you don't seem to be calling for them to be implicated and their writings to be thrown out even though they even OWNED slaves. (!!) See, I think the real problem here for you is that folks generally understand that people operate and act within the context they live in. I'll keep striving to go by the admonition of love and forgiveness in the Bible, thank you, and choose not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, as many other like King, Tutu, White, etc. who are likely more credible on this than you have done. Clearly, most people understand the value of taking the good from something. and not letting the warts keep them from doing that. Pity that you don't.\n \n \nGod CAN do what he wants, just like a mob boss can do what he wants cause he has the force.\n Doesn't make it right.\n\n \n \"Doesn't make it right\"? Who's morality is God beholden to, Foundit? You're trying to make him succumb to a morality that he puts on FINITE humans? We're back to the problems with that line of thinking--it's the sort of morality that wouldn't let someone stop the Hitlers of the world, if they know the end of the story. \n \n \nAt least I have a reason for my position. It could be flawed, but there is no rational reason for thinking so.\n\n \n What 'position' is that? Going on crusades against religion by trying to play up it's inconsistencies? yeah, I'm sure you DO have a reason for that.\n \n \nYou're a subservient slave all right.\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n Yeah. I guess that's why I made it clear I'm no inerrantist, and well know that the Bible has inconsistencies.\n \n Geez, dude.\n By the standards you're demanding, ANYONE who's ever done good having been inspired by their religion is a \"subservient slave.\" ML King, for example .... I really don't think you WANT to keep this schtick up.\n \n \nBlind faith is a dangerous game. It's not the rational move.\n\n \n I've never said I think faith should be 'blind', Foundit. Again, I really think you need to take this up with the people who DO that sort of thing.\n \n \nJyoshu, I'm not the one with blinders on here.\n I have REPEATEDLY FREELY ADMITTED that the bible has examples of inspired good.\n YOU are the one who refuses to admit its inspirations of evil... emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n But you're only JUDGING it based on one side of that coin. THAT'S the problem. The side that best feeds and comes out of anti-religious prejudice, interestingly enough. emoticon_xangel",

Yes, you acknowledge that there are contradictions but you don't explain how the bible can be used to justify anything becuase which portion of the bible do you read from? The good stuff or the bad stuff? What people do with the bible is deem others sinful when the bible itself doesn't even live up to the most basic moral standards of today.

If he didn't mean it or changed his mind then what does that say about the rest of the bible? Especially the parts that are contraversial?\n \n Let's go back and compare the bible to the constitution. You can't change the bible as who would have the authority to do so?

Yes, you acknowledge that there are contradictions but you don't explain how the bible can be used to justify anything becuase which portion of the bible do you read from? \n\n \n Personally, I think you're making this waaaaaayy too complicated. The things people should justify with the bible if they want are good and compassionate acts. And they do. When it's used to justify evil, that's a bad thing. I have no idea why God told the Israelites to go and take slaves in that passage, but where God did that, I don't see that as meaning people can just go and take slaves. There are a lot of things God did that we don't know for certain why he did them. God told Hosea to take a prostitute for a wife. Does that mean I think God wants people to take prostitutes for wives, in general? No. He didn't give some general command toward humanity to do either one. We no more need to assume that's what he meant when we criticize the Bible than when religious people take that sort of approach with the Bible themselves.\n \n \nFine, then all the gay stuff in the bible doesn't matter either because I think god changed his mind and you can't prove otherwise.\n\n \n No one is making you go by any one interpretation of the Bible's take on same-gender relations. You're free to read it however you choose.\n \n \nBut you are ignoring the bad\n\n \n No, I'm not ignoring it. After all, I'm having a conversation about it with you, am I not? That's not ignoring. I just choose to not ignore the good in the Bible as well. In fact, I choose to live in a way that aspires to that good, or least I hope. What would you prefer people do here? Abandon the Bible? I see no point in that. It has a lot of good things in it. Obviously, you have little to worry about here as there's not a lot of enslaving going on. I think the fact people generally don't go out and nab people for slaves is indicative that the way you and Foundit see the Bible is not very typical at all. I think most people are able to read between the lines better than that, and take context and culture into consideration. \n \n \nLet's go back and compare the bible to the constitution.

It is a document recognized as not being perfect and becuase it is not it is changable.\n\n \n I think you're misunderstanding what I mean. You guys are wanting to make a blanket claim the Bible is pro-slavery. With such an over-simplification view as that, one could condemn Jefferson because HE owned slaves. One could condemn many of the founding fathers and say we should condemn their work. But we don't do that--we revere them DESPITE that. We do that because we realize they operated and lived in a particular context and culture that, unfortunately, allowed slavery. That's the way the Bible is. It was written in such a culture. \n \n \nBack to the abolitionists, if I owned a slave, where in the bible would I be wrong? I'm sure there is something (I honestly don't know) and I'm asking you to show me the error of my ways.\n\n \n I think the abolitionist view of the Bible is based more on the broader concepts of equality human rights from scripture and the compassion-based teachings of Jesus and elsewhere in scripture. (Interestingly, this further mirrors the way slavery was eventually deemed unconstitutional.)\n \n If you are truly interested in this topic, here is a good article that brings out both sides of the issue as well as the difficulties that both sides faced by trying to use Biblical justification.",

   "So .... if God told his people in the OT to sacrifice animals, you assume that means they should KEEP doing so even today??? Because THAT'S the sort of silly logic you're employing here. \n\n Again you try to shift the goal-posts...\n I was clearly talking about your claim that God WOULD NOT use his \"command-giving powers\" to alter a culture's action, in an area like slavery.\n Instead of addressing that issue, you instead try to shift the topic of discussion by fixating on something I WAS NOT COMMENTING ON.\n \n It's bizarre how you CONTINUALLY try to insinuate that God would not give commands to shape a culture, and then habitually refuse to defend that claim against obvious refuting comments.\n \n \n \nNo, you clearly aren't getting it, at least what's important here. What you're doing is like someone saying that the Bible tells us to forgive our enemies, and then turning right around and claiming such a statement ACTUALLY means it's ok to be someone's enemy. That the Bible SUPPORTS being someone's enemy. You just aren't getting it.\n\n You are very wrong in your analogy.\n First of all, Having an enemy can have absolutely nothing to do with the actions of a person. Ghandi didn't go around beating people up, but HE had enemies. Jesus didn't sin at all (supposedly), and HE had enemies.\n \n But going a step further, < snort <, you HAVE TO BE JOKING.\n The Bible is filled with examples of \"go out and kill this nation\". Go out and slaughter the neighboring country's men and non-virgin women folk, taking the virgin women folk as your wives.\n The biblical God ordered actions THAT OBVIOUSLY CREATED enemies.\n And then you want to talk about whether or not \"it's ok to be someone's enemy\" by a biblical standard???\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n God's commands of murder and mayhem CREATED enemies.\n I don't think the biblical God gave a pile of excrement about that reality, beyond killing them off...\n \n \n \nI already said here that I'm no inerrantist. That a book with that many authors from that many contexts and perspectives has errors doesn't really matter to me; it's completely expected.\n\n I'm going to have to create a new abbreviation where you take the INTRO to my point out of context, quote JUST that without the MAIN POINT I was making, and then pretend you've refuted something.\n \n To repeat my comment, which you obviously side-stepped...\n What else is wrong then?\n Laws on homosexuality? Laws on wearing poly-fabric blend? Laws on planting two crops in the same field?\n If \"I believe...\" is the only real justification you have for a morality, and you admit that the SOURCE of your beliefs is errant, where does that leave it?\n \n I am talking about the CONSEQUENCES of errancy, which you have failed to recognize...\n Paul is one great example!\n Look at the tone of Jesus's comments. How he led his people.\n Judge not, lest ye be judged. Take the beam out of your own eye before talking about the mote in your brother's eye.\n \n And then Paul comes along and changes the mentality approach. While Jesus didn't point fingers, Paul is happy to point out others in condemnation.\n I can't help but think that when early Christians were picking and choosing what books to include in the bible and which books to exclude, they picked Paul cause he fit in with their continuing Pharisee and Sadducee mentality.\n \n \n \nWhen did you stop beating your wife? \n\n Do you even understand the meaning of that question?\n Cause your attempt to apply it here demonstrates that you clearly haven't a clue.\n \n That question makes an assumption about an act, and then asks a question assuming the act occurred.\n Me? I'm just asking you a question about something YOU DO NOT WANT to answer. Not the same thing. I make no assumptions.\n \n \n \nNo, it DOESN'T say that except in a specific case toward a specific nation at a specific time. \n\n You are ridiculously wrong.\n Leviticus 25:44-46 is one great example.\n \n And regardless, your response is amazing.\n If I said \"I didn't say any guy could kill his wife. I just had some specific cases for some specific wives\", would that be that much better? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nThere's a narrative where God tells the Israelites to go get slaves. For a more general admonition, it does tells how to deal with slaves in the culture and in fact in the NT tells to treat them well. You're acting like an over-zealous prosecutor here trying to implicate someone by pulling things out of context and time-frame.\n\n What absurd junk.\n NOTHING is pulled out of context.\n I wish there was a mandatory requirement that any time somebody claimed \"out of context\", there was a requirement for PROOF of \n 1) what was said,\n 2) what the context actually establishes, \n 3) how the two differ.\n \n Cause here, there is NOTHING that demonstrates this was just about a \"specific\" time.\n \n \n \nYou're getting into FOPIOI territory here. Particularly ironic since you're the one trying to make such a big deal here about the Bible and slavery.\n\n FOPIOI???\n YOU are the one who brought YOUR perspective on the issue.\n And when I respond to YOUR COMMENT, suddenly it's \"FOPIOI\"...\n :xbanghead :xbanghead\n \n When you first introduced that term, I KNEW you were going to use it as a means to complain about others talking about your own comments...\n \n \n \n(Shrug) Just like Jefferson and many of our founding fathers of the republic. Funny though, that you don't seem to be calling for them to be implicated and their writings to be thrown out even though they even OWNED slaves.\n\n Say whaaaa????\n \"to be thrown out\"???\n Please. Quote me in what I am actually saying that justifies that assessment.\n \n \n \nSee, I think the real problem here for you is that folks generally understand that people operate and act within the context they live in.\n\n I think the real problem here for you is that you use phrases like \"within the context they live in\", refusing to recognize it revolves around SECULAR ADVANCEMENTS IN SOCIETY.\n The bible is supposed to be eternal and unchanging.\n It says \"No gay sex\", so supposedly that standard exists forever.\n \n But suddenly you have some passages you don't like, so you start talking about \"context\" as if it's an excuse to ignore the previous ACTUAL WORDING... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nI'll keep striving to go by the admonition of love and forgiveness in the Bible...\n\n Except when it comes to people who don't share your politics, like Byrd...\n Eh?\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n...and choose not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, as many other like King, Tutu, White, etc. who are likely more credible on this than you have done.\n\n What does it take you to admit what my actual position is???\n I have ALWAYS admitted the bible includes comments regarding good.\n I am not talking about \"throwing out\" the entire book.\n \n I am talking about the implications of recognizing an ERRANT book on \"morality\", and how it requires JUDGMENT to evaluate its claims (like no pork, no poly-fabric clothing, no homosexual sex) and to REJECT those that are obvious nonsense.\n \n The really sad part is that people like you UNDERSTAND that for some issues.\n But for other issues, like homosexuality, you refuse to see the light of day and how archaic and nonsensical the demands of the bible are.\n \n \n \nClearly, most people understand the value of taking the good from something. and not letting the warts keep them from doing that. Pity that you don't.\n\n At this stage, your arguments are just plain BLOWI.\n I have repeatedly admitted the bible has good in it.\n You refuse to utilize intellectual integrity in admitting that...\n \n \n \n\"Doesn't make it right\"? Who's morality is God beholden to, Foundit? You're trying to make him succumb to a morality that he puts on FINITE humans? We're back to the problems with that line of thinking--it's the sort of morality that wouldn't let someone stop the Hitlers of the world, if they know the end of the story.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n And here is part of the problem of your blind religious faith.\n You actually think that it's an issue of STOPPING HITLER, that is somehow a \"good\" out of God allowing GENOCIDE, SLAVERY, and MISOGYNY in the Bible...\n \n YOU HAVE NO JUSTIFICATION for that assumption, but you make it in order to try and justify God's OBVIOUSLY IMMORAL acts.\n The really funny thing about this is Hitler happened.\n I can't help but wonder if Jyoshu thinks that we shouldn't have allowed women the right to vote, or else kept slaves, or maybe just killed the entire country of Germany in world war I in order to stop Hitler...\n \n One of the things that makes \"Hitler\" such an extreme evil is that he PRACTICED GENOCIDE.\n Yet, we turn around and GOD practices genocide for a variety of nations, and suddenly it's for the purpose of PREVENTING a Hitler???\n \n That's like saying \"I'm going to burn this village to the ground in order to save this village\"... :xbanghead\n \n \n \nWhat 'position' is that? Going on crusades against religion by trying to play up it's inconsistencies? yeah, I'm sure you DO have a reason for that.\n\n The betterment of mankind by ACTUALLY THINKING about the situation, and using SECULAR LOGIC and MORALITY to evaluate things instead of just cause some \"burning bush\" supposedly told somebody something a few thousand years ago.\n \n If today, some guy came up to you on the street and told you that you had to do something cause a burning bush told him, you'd judge him crazy.\n But if somebody says it happened thousands of years ago, you take it as a moral imperative...\n \n \n \nYeah. I guess that's why I made it clear I'm no inerrantist, and well know that the Bible has inconsistencies.\n\n Again, you take MY comment out of context.\n I wasn't talking about your position on \"errancy\".\n I was talking about how you're a slave to believing that whatever somebody tells you that God told him, you HAVE to go for it...\n You REFUSE to think for yourself about some ridiculously obvious examples of Biblical evil. THAT is where you are a slave.\n \n \n \nI've never said I think faith should be 'blind', Foundit. Again, I really think you need to take this up with the people who DO that sort of thing.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n You talk about \"preventing Hitler\" in order to justify some of the Bible's most absurd evils, and then you say that you don't think faith should be \"blind\"...\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n What's next?\n You insist people should look both ways before crossing the street, then you put a football helmet on backwards, and run through the cross-walk?\n Your CLAIMED position, and your ACTUAL position are two different things.\n \n \n \nBut you're only JUDGING it based on one side of that coin. THAT'S the problem. The side that best feeds and comes out of anti-religious prejudice, interestingly enough. emoticon_xangel\n\n \"anti-religious prejudice\"???\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I talk about QUESTIONING the belief, and you claim that is \"anti-religious prejudice\"...\n And I am NOT judging it based on only one side of the coin.\n \n What I am saying, taking Sanford as an example, is that if you have a person CLAIMING they are for one thing, then finding out that he behaves in an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT manner, then you gotta question WHAT HE WAS REALLY ABOUT in the first place.",
