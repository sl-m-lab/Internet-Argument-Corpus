   "Here is a hint for all you wart suffers. In 1996 I developed a large wart on my index finger. I tried for 6 years every treatment there was from home wart removers to having a doctor freeze it off, did that one every month for 2 years. I tried having the doctor use acid, I tried the wart lotions, bandaids, razor blades. Until having a converstion with a friend of mine , who is a PA, looked at the wart and I told her what I had done for several years. She was amazed that nothing worked. She explianed that the treatments of acid and freezing work by creating irritation so that the immune system attacks the wart. \n \n Over the past several years we bulit a house in the woods and I had more poison ivy then grass. When I mowed I would get poison ivy all over my legs. I looked into why poison ivy acts the way it does and found that the urushiol oil causes an immune reaction in humans. I put two and two together and rubbed poison ivy into the wart and a coulpe of weeks later the wart was gone. Let me say that the itching was way better then the repetitive torture of getting the wart frozen off.\n \n Of course I am not extreamly reactive to posion ivy so I wouldn't want someone who is to try this if it is going to kill you.",
