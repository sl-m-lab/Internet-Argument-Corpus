   "One friend was telling me of a lot of people who are angry about the government, almost to the point of violence.

Just recently we have the Corn husker kickbacks, Florida&#8217;s deal The Union exemptions etc in order to get this Healthcare Bill that 75% of We the People didn&#8217;t want!\n \n Not to mention all of the scam gun laws they FORCED down our throats, causing 250 Congressional representatives, 39 states and the Vice President sign the brief in Heller. 58 senators and 251 members of the House of Representatives have filed a joint brief in favor of McDonald arguing for &#8220;Fundamental Right&#8221; status and incorporation under both &#8220;due process&#8221; and &#8220;P&I&#8221; and 38 states have filed a joint brief arguing for 2nd.

We are ALL Righteously Yelling Enough is Enough! \n \n Democratic Representatives REFUSE to listen to their Constituents, The ONLY owners of this country! \n \n WHAT BOVINE EXCREMENT! And I was putting that mildly! emoticon_smile \n \n One thing is becoming very clear. Many on the Left do not like the Constitution, committing genocidal war on it&#8217;s Bill of Rights, and walking all over our Constitution and through our minds with their Dirty, Muddy Feet, trying to remake our country into a Godless Utopian living Dante&#8217;s Inferno that they so desperately want. THIS has got to STOP!!!!!! Get it Lefties!!!\n \n  The Declaration of Independence says this. \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\n \n You are tearing this country apart, trying to steal away the Government we all love and want! \n \n So let us support YOUR wish to make whatever Utopian government you want by supporting your desire for succession. You can take California, Washington and Oregon, and the Liberal states on the East Coast, if the vote along with you, but let us stop this destruction of a system of government we like! \n \n If they vote for succession, then so be it, but you must live by whatever We the People chose and if you stay, you MUST respect the Rule of Law and the governmental confines of our Constitution!\n \n I say, let us support you in every way, with this hearty goodbye. \n \n It is YOU!

Humm. Well maybe we are not mistaken after all! \n \n Dude. You have states filing suits, just like they filed briefs in Heller and McDonald telling the Government their laws are becoming excessive and that they WANT the Bill of Rights to apply to the state governments as well. That makes it the entire government that is wrapped up with these differences. Not just a few wack jobs with a few signs that you hope people will believe. \n \n Who has ever heard of such things? I am 62 and I am telling you from my prospective, this is truly bazaar! Things are out of wack, and people are recognizing it, even if you do not wish to. \n \n And If healthcare was so right why did they have to bribe our Congressional leaders in order to SLICK us into it? Why did we have to hear about the Deeming rule and the Slaughter rule, if you had the 2/3rds votes? Why did they have to tell SCIU that they would be exempt from paying the Cadillac tax! Apparently even your union was happy about the particulars of paying for it. \n \n This whole process has left a foul smell in America, and people are recognizing it for what it is. \n   14 states file suit against health care reform  \n \n I am telling you that our differences are coming close to unrecognizable. Stick your head in the sand if you wish, but it is NOT us who are trying to change things. Congress has had to declare everything on earth Commerce in order to have the Constitutional authority to act on it. \n \n It is all just B.S. \n \n Live under the confines of the Constitution. Change it if you think you can muster the votes. But that would correct way of creating change. The Lawful way! That's too hard! your side whines! \n \n The solution, in the end, may end up being to dissolve our bands like India and Pakistan did.

   "At most it will lead to another Timothy McVeigh type incident. But where were these angry people when the Republicans decided to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to fight a war because of WMDs that turned out to be imaginary? I guess passing new health care legislation in an effort to help out millions of uninsured people must be the greater offense. As long as the government uses its money to kill people rather than help people then it must be okay. I suspect the vast majority of these \"scam\" gun laws will be unaffected by Heller or MacDonald. That's why people from such organizations as the Brady Campaign continue to remain optimistic. Of course, if the Supreme Court had the courage and honesty to come out and tell the truth about the Second Amendment instead of some watered down version of the right focused on private self defense they probably would end up offending gun control advocates more. But that's unlikely to happen. The well regulated militia was meant to be a defense against tyranny. The fact that gun activists don't advocate a restoration of the old militia laws shows that they are more interested in coming up with a convenient argument against the gun laws they personally dislike (e.g. we can't have gun registration because they had it in Nazi Germany blah, blah, blah....) than in protecting Americans against actual tyranny. Most gun activists don't understand that liberty and responsibility are two sides of the same coin and they probably never will.\n\n \n Interesting that you know part of Nazi history but tout health care:\n Hitler&#8217;s and Obama&#8217;s health enabling acts\n Both anti rights gun laws and mandated health care was foisted on the people by Hitler.",

   "iangb. As Doc points out, the Constitution, The Supreme Law of the land, sets forth a list of Rights so Fundamental that our Founders saw as self evident and Constitutionally protected them. It also included a list of other negative Rights against the Government, and restraints on how it was to operate. It is a government that we want. \n \n However, there was even a directive sent from this administration to watch for people who talk a lot about the Constitution. What? You can't talk about the Constitution? The Supreme Law of the land. Yet the Left wants to make even more gun laws against our Inalienable Right, that If we violate, that they will take Great Pleasure is watching us go to jail! After all, That would be the LAW, and their are No Excuses when violating the Law! That hypocrisy is totally unbelievable, and unacceptable. Either the law is, or it isn't. It can't be both ways.\n \n Congress's approval rating horrendous. The Presidents approval rating has finally dropped below 50% Does that mean that, since we elected this government, we are now stuck to accept anything they pass? I don't think so. There are Constitutional constraints, and it is the law.\n \n Democrats totally run the government right now, and it is a majority that made the Republicans absolutely irrelevant. But, just look at all the slick deals they had to cut in order to get healthcare passed. They literally fought themselves, and tore themselves apart in the bargain. But the Republicans are the party of NO! Give me a break!\n \n When they lost their Super Majority in the Senate, the People of Massachusetts, (who incidentally have Universal healthcare) sent a message that everyone heard loud and clear. It was yet another shot heard around the world from Massachusetts. Even my Communist Congressman Dennis Kucenich said this election meant something profound. Congress ignores this massage at their own peril. \n \n But then even more slick deals occurred to get it passed. \n \n The Left doesn't like to talk about this, but Democratic Congressman Bart Stupac got death threats from the Left if he didn't change his vote. Yet another hypocritical position? \n \n It is becoming increasingly clear that many on the Left do NOT want to live under a government that we currently have, or under a government who is restrained by our Constitution, and they desperately want to change it. They have an ideal government in mind, and they want to create it.\n \n We on the other hand do not want to live under a government they will create. \n \n The people on the Left are pretty much good people, generally, but they must resort to every dirty trick in the book in order to slime us, and it is tearing us apart. We are not the people they must paint us in order to gain enough votes to stay in power. You saw some of it in this thread. Oh the (Insert whatever)ers are raciest, and or such and so. Elect our people! Not Them!!!! \n \n I am sure that they will likely say the same about us. \n \n In other words, our differences are pretty much irreconcilable, and we all know it. \n \n So how do we fix this? \n \n I proposed a solution that can be amicable to both. They get exactly what they want, and we get to keep the government that our Founders built. We will be friends again, and each will enjoy the government that each wants.\n \n Otherwise, what is the outcome? What if we go even further Right after the next set of elections? What will the Left do? How will they feel? \n \n We care about that! \n \n Currently, we seem to be locked into a never-ending death struggle that will surely tear us, and our country apart. All great powers fall, and we seem to be watching the demise of the U.S. as a World Power and a great society.\n \n I see the Status Quo as currently unsustainable.",

To be more precise, what *Tither* wants.\n \n The fact remains that the government has been democratically elected and can do whatever they feel like, as long as it remains legal. In fact, there are plenty of lawsuits being formulated against democrat ideas such as the healthcare overhaul on the basis that it isn't legal, but I doubt any will be successful.\n \n Democrats may reap the consequences of their actions come the next voting season - that remains to be seen, although it looks like public opinion of the healthcare changes is rising again now that it's actually passed (and - dare I say - some of the lies told about it have been more firmly laid to rest). But that change in government will come as a result of the will of the People, not as a result of the vocal actions of a disgruntled minority who claim to represent the whole.\n \n Without meaning offence, this all sounds a bit like sour grapes. The guy you don't like got into power, the guy you don't like is doing things you also don't like. That doesn't make it undemocratic.\n \n \nThe people on the Left are pretty much good people, generally, but they must resort to every dirty trick in the book in order to slime us, and it is tearing us apart.\n What I'd say is currently most dividing the political landscape at the moment is hyper-partisanship - catalysed by Obama, but originating from Palin, Beck and the Tea Party movement as much as from any radical left-wingers. Because a lot of Obama's policies have a slightly more liberal lean to them than the US is used to (note they still aren't hugely liberal - a major reason for the democratic split on healthcare was that it didn't include the public option that the further left was chasing), many republicans are now at the stage where they will reject a democrat proposal purely on the basis that it is democrat in origin. The Tea Party and the more vocal political commentators (Beck et al) are poisoning the well, and a lot of the conservative forum-goers I know (and like!) are falling into the trap as well - every time you see a reference to 'Obummer' etc is a reflection of the same partisanship that Simone suffers from, coming from the opposite side of the spectrum.\n \n As to your 'solution' - at the moment, given that the Democrats are in power, I'd more be expecting the Right to up and off rather than the Left. It certainly seems that the threats of violence have been right-wing-based, of late. Anyhoo, such a 'solution' would lead to a particularly vicious civil war - if not one of arms, then of economics, social stigma and apartheid based on the colour of your bumper stickers. Much better to actually sit down and talk rather than force the divide wider than it already is.\n \n We're all mostly good people - just with different ideas about how the world works, and how it should work. Unfortunately it seems that at the moment people are concentrating purely on the ideological differences and ignoring the fact that, in the end, most of everyone wants what's best for their country. This makes for interesting reading, if only for a minute or so.",

   "1363 posts and you don't think you've given any clue about your wants on these topics? What did you think you were doing in them, then, if not justifying those wants? I can't help but feel that you haven't actually read my post, you've just focused on a few words and knee-jerked out a response.\n Anyway - as I said, I was specifically talking about Tithers 'wants' as he implied in the OP; mainly gun laws and health care laws that he agrees with, for the most part, though you could probably just generalise that to 'legislation passed by the government'.\n \n You really need to read the whole of what I've written rather than just the start of a few sentences, or you're going to keep on telling me I'm wrong while viciously agreeing with me.\n If it is legal, they can do it. I haven't claimed anything else.\n \n Indeed. As I said, I doubt anything will come of it, though.\n \n *shrug*\n I haven't been all that concerned with the meat of the bill itself, as it really doesn't affect me - I'm more interested in the rhetoric that gets flung around as a result, and the effect it has on the public opinion. \n From what I've seen, republicans have made some massive blunders - they are just as guilty as anyone else about not reading the document in question, so they've been throwing out some pretty whopping truth-benders in the hope that the resulting public pressure would cause the democrats to cave in. Now that the bluff (or not...) has been called and the bill is law, those half-truths are being exposed, so the fact that there may be some actual blunders in the paperwork that both parties missed is not anywhere near as crippling for the dems as it could have been otherwise.\n \n But I digress.\n \n My thanks for being a prime example of the 'well-poisoning' that I mentioned above.\n Ironically, the tables are now turned - the Right (as individuals note, not as a whole) is considering some violent acts instead - not because they hate America, but because they disagree with the direction America is going in.

The lean of the president doesn't affect his decisions - but it certainly affects the actions of those who are politically affiliated.\n \n Tranquillisers?\n\n \n Let's get some things straight. Government has 3 duties, to protect property, presever contract and provide for the rule of law. Their job is not to constrain freedom but to encourage it. Not to tax people into slavery nor to issue tyrannical dictates demanding actions such as purchase of a product like healthcare by gov't fiat. The president's duties are to control the executive branch to see that the duties of the executive are fullfilled and properly executed. His job is not to issue writs of mandamanus to the citizenry. You play between the two like a drunken sailor plays the flute. They work for us, we do not work for them. We are the boss, they are our elected servants and we pay them well, too well. You must confuse your government with no Constitution with ours which has a Constitution and is Republican, not democratic. That is why you fail to see the contempt by the executive branch who even attacks the Supreme Court Justices in a State of the Union address. Just the idea of him taking the speaker's stand with his head raised so everyone could peer up his nostrils is unbecoming and a breach of the separation of powers. It is not a dictatorship!! He acts like he is and it is evident. The last picture of Consecue comes to mind when he made his final decree by/or fiat. You might visit constitution.org site and get an education. Your basis for intelligent conversation is lacking any common ground for you to even attempt to debate our government, the duties and what is wrong. BTW, the part you bolded ignored the true meaning of the phrase that preceeded it. Slight of hand there slick?",

The president who promised change has certainly brought change to Washington, but this polling data shows that any hope that still remains is skipping town on the next train out of Union Station.\" \n \n The poll shows 40 percent of respondents expect the quality of health care will get much worse under \"Obamacare,\" as the president's plan is dubbed, and another 10.4 percent said it will get a little worse. Some 19.8 percent they believe and hope it will improve much. \n \n Nearly 72 percent of voters said they were much less likely or somewhat less likely to support an incumbent in Congress who backs \"granting citizenship to millions of people who are now living illegally here in the U.S.\" - essentially an amnesty program. \n \n Some 82 percent of voters are much less likely or somewhat less likely to support incumbents who back more bailouts for banks and companies. Nearly 60 percent oppose incumbents who support \"economic stimulus\" legislation.\n \n Support for \"cap and trade,\" a plan expected to raise taxes on energy dramatically, earns opposition from nearly 50 percent. \n \n The antipathy towards Congress also extends to Obama, the survey revealed. \n \n \"Not that President Obama is riding high after signing the health bill into law - in fact, his job approval rating has dropped to 41 percent from 46 percent a month ago. Men have turned hard against the president ... just 30 percent of men say he is doing a good job.\" \n \n Women had a higher opinion of Obama, with a bare majority of 52 percent giving him positive marks. \n \n Last month's poll had included a warning for incumbents. \n \n At that time 54 percent of those who had a \"very favorable\" opinion of the tea party movement said they would vote for the challenger - any challenger - in November. One-third of those who held a \"somewhat favorable\" opinion and four in 10 who held a \"very unfavorable\" opinion would do the same.\n \n While those who were not sure was a statistically high 33 percent of the total, 41 percent of respondents said they would support a challenger to only 26 percent for the incumbent. \n \n The February poll showed only 2.8 percent of Americans believed Congress' job performance is excellent, including only 7.5 of Democrats.\n",

Only 30% believe that those in Congress have a better understanding of the key issues facing the nation.\n \n When it comes to those issues, 47% think that their own political views are closer to those of the average Tea Party member than to the views of the average member of Congress. On this point, 26% feel closer to Congress.\n \n Finally, 46% of voters say that the average Tea Party member is more ethical than the average member of Congress. Twenty-seven percent (27%) say that the average member of Congress is more ethical.\n\n \n Oh oh, Only 30% believe that those in Congress have a better understanding of the key issues facing the nation.

   "  CBO report: Debt will rise to 90% of GDP \n President Obama's fiscal 2011 budget will generate nearly $10 trillion in cumulative budget deficits over the next 10 years, $1.2 trillion more than the administration projected, and raise the federal debt to 90 percent of the nation's economic output by 2020, the Congressional Budget Office reported Thursday. \n \n In its 2011 budget, which the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released Feb. 1, the administration projected a 10-year deficit total of $8.53 trillion. After looking it over, CBO said in its final analysis, released Thursday, that the president's budget would generate a combined $9.75 trillion in deficits over the next decade. \n \n \"An additional $1.2 trillion in debt dumped on [GDP] to our children makes a huge difference,\" said Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"That represents an additional debt of $10,000 per household above and beyond the federal debt they are already carrying.\" \n \n The federal public debt, which was $6.3 trillion ($56,000 per household) when Mr. Obama entered office amid an economic crisis, totals $8.2 trillion ($72,000 per household) today, and it's headed toward $20.3 trillion (more than $170,000 per household) in 2020, according to CBO's deficit estimates. \n \n That figure would equal 90 percent of the estimated gross domestic product in 2020, up from 40 percent at the end of fiscal 2008. By comparison, America's debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at 109 percent at the end of World War II, while the ratio for economically troubled Greece hit 115 percent last year. \n",

Economists say that deficits of that size are unsustainable and could put upward pressure on interest rates, crowd out private investment in the economy and ultimately erode the nation's standard of living.\n \n \"While the president is intent on ramming through Congress a new trillion-dollar health-care entitlement, he appears far less concerned with addressing the looming crisis of entitlement spending already on the books,\" said Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the Budget Committee. \"Instead, he delegates this task to a 'Fiscal Commission' -- which would not even report until after the next election.\"\n\n \n   Bernanke: Medicare, Social Security could be casualties of mounting deficit \n The growing deficit could force the federal government to raise taxes or change entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Social Security, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said this week.\n \n If the country fails to demonstrate fiscal responsibility, the country faces a loss of financial stability and robust economic growth, he said. The speech comes just weeks after President Obama signed into law a nearly $1 trillion healthcare reform bill. Critics contend it will increase deficits, even though the Congressional Budget Office determined it will reduce deficits. \n\n Uh. change entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Social Security. Isn't that rationing? I'm just saying!\n   Key Fiscal Leaders Sound Dire Deficit Warnings \n In separate events, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke, White House budget director Peter Orszag and Congressional Budget Office director Steve Elmendorf all said the nation is on a perilous fiscal path that must be reversed or the U.S.'s economy will suffer grievous harm. \n \n \"The arithmetic is, unfortunately, quite clear. To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some combination of the above,\" Bernanke said.\n \n \"These choices are difficult, and it always seems easier to put them off -- until the day they cannot be put off any more,\" he said. \n \n In response to a question, Orszag said the administration has no official position on the merits of instituting a VAT. He said that comments this week supporting that idea by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker were given by Volcker in his \"private capacity.\"\n \n Elmendorf, the CBO chief, also said Wednesday that the nation's fiscal course is \"unsustainable\" and that fundamental reforms are needed. \n\n \n A VAT (Value added tax) in which every time something is made and stops to have somewhere else to have something done, a hidden tax is applied every time the quote value is added. Thus raising the price of all goods and services. \n \n Plus a Cap and Trade tax. Which Candidate   Obama said, energy prices would have to necessarily skyrocket. \n \n You now have been informed. Deal wisely with the information.",
