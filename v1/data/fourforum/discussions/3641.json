   "I was raped at a young teen age and it took me until I was 25 and married for 6 years even to get that out of my mind. Everytime I had sex I would freeze up and definitely would not enjoy it. Jennifer is getting married this Saturday, 3 months after the so called rape. Does this make sense? Let me know what you think. Let the media know what you think. Who is the loving family she talks about? We just want to know. Is this a pattern? Let us know what you think about the whole situation. Herbes 2 she mentioned. Would you marry a man knowing you have this, what precautions, and will she now get pregnant just so she does not have to return to active duty?",

I simply don't see themilitaries motivation to cover up such an event. It also seems that , given the charges made here, it would be appropriate to publish the results form the rape kit, which she should be able to obtain with no difficulty. \n \n I agree that if she was really raped the guy should be punished. I just don;t see enoguh evidenc ein this article to form an opinion one way or the other. It is long on emotion and implied impropreities and short on facts.\n \n From the fact that they threatened to charge her with filing a false police reprt after a few days, it would certianly seem that they investigated, reviewed the reports from the hospital and the results from the rape kit (which take a couple days to get back), and found her story to be lacking.",
