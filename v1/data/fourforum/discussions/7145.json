   "My son informs me he has transferred the tracks from over a thousand CDs to his 6OGB iPod. So he takes about 13000 songs about with him in his pocket - which it would take nearly four weeks to listen to on a 24/7 basis. But does he really \"need\" all that choice? I would bet that he will never listen to more than a tiny fraction of the stuff. This is technological overkill.\n \n I've toyed with the idea of buying myself an iPod \"for Christmas\" - mainly to satisfy my craving for gadgets. But I never listen to some of my CDs, so what's the point of copying them to an iPod and never listening to them on that ingenious little instrument either?",

   "I have an Iriver H-10 20gig. It playes music, has a digital FM radio, MP3 FM recorder, MP3 voice recorder with Line imput. Photo album, and text viewer ( you can read books in PDF format). It has 40 pre set EQ's, a custom equalizer and color screen. Battery lasts 20 hrs and includes usb 2.0 cord and charger. Requires NO software. Just Windows Media Player 10. It comes with an updater CD if you dont have WMP 10. It comes in 3 models a 10 gig, 20gig and a 40gig. 10 gig is usually $200. 20gig is $270 at Bestbuy.com. And the 40 gig $400. Since itrunes deverts ripped music from a CD from MP to itunes, it compresses the track which shortens the wavelength within the track. Anotherwords faster streaming, but less quality. The Ipods earbuds have a metal screen which creates friction and reverb on certain tracks. The IRiver's earbuds are plastic with insulation inside. I currently use Sony earbuds which go into the ear canal ($40). Thses are 10 times more powerful than conventional earbuds and are very very nice indeed. So before you buy into the iPod craze check out iRiver. Trust me I have gone through seven MP3 Players and this one is by far the best. Go to iriveramerica.com or bestbuy.com to check it out. Oh and it also has SRS WOW EQ as well, and when i said MP3 FM recorder I mean it recordes in MP3 format right from the player. And the FM radio is digital with stereo output.",
