   "Today is our primary day here in Ohio, and I thought I'd send out a comparison of the positions of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on issues of concern to gay people. I checked out the Human Rights Campaign website, and it turns out that their positions are identical. They both support equality in every way except marriage.

   "That's an interesting 'glass-half-full' way of putting it. In other words they are anti-gay-marriage. I realise they are probably more gay-friendly than the Republican candidates though.\n\n \n Well, the positions of the Democrats on same-sex marriage are somewhat muddled, I think, at least according to the information in the Pew Forum. Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama voted against the proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. So did John McCain. In terms of what the two Democrats have said, both have suggested that same-sex marriage should be up to the states. McCain has said the same thing. But McCain's website talks about protecting the traditional family, which is clearly aimed at appealing to the anti-gay Republicans. \n \n Here is a link to the Pew information and excerpts focusing on the two Democrats and the one Republican who are viable candidate:\n \n http://pewforum.org/religion08/compare.php?Issue=Gay_Marriage\n \n \"Clinton opposes same-sex marriage and favors civil unions but said she would not stand in the way if New York passed a law legalizing same-sex marriage. In the U.S. Senate, she opposed amending the Constitution to ban gay marriage. While she has solicited and received the support of gay and lesbian groups, many gay activists were alarmed over her March 2007 comment that the morality of homosexuality was up \"to others to conclude.\" She later released a statement saying that she does not believe homosexuality is immoral....\n \n \"Obama says that he believes \"marriage is between a man and a woman\" but he wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he remains \"open to the possibility that my unwillingness to support gay marriage is misguided ... I may have been infected with society's prejudices and predilections and attributed them to God.\" He supports granting civil unions for gay couples and opposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In March 2007, Obama initially dodged questions about the morality of homosexuality. He later went on to say on national television that he did not believe homosexuals are immoral....\n \n \"McCain says marriage should be between a man and a woman and that states should regulate marriage law. He opposed a federal constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, but endorsed an Arizona ballot initiative to limit marriage to a man and a woman. He also supported the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which banned federal recognition of gay marriage and domestic partnerships.\"",

There are a lot of complicated issues that have to be resolved before the Democratic convention, such as what will happen with Florida and Michigan, and what will happen with those super-delegates? The whole thing is unclear right now, largely because of how the party organized the nominating process. That process has produced much uncertainty about who the nominee will be. One thing we know: Hillary Clinton is not giving up, and she does have a shot at getting the nomination, certainly a better shot than she had before yesterday. I hope that now she will be treated with more respect than she has been up to this point.",

That's why people are suspicious of her intentions on this issue.\n\n \n Suspicious? Obviously she wants to win the race, and that's her intention. She is trying to win. So is Obama. And he has no claim to a moral high ground either. They are both trying to win. \n \n Clinton did not break any rules. I think she does have an argument when it comes to seating the delegates from Florida, because she won there and all of the candidates' names, including Obama, were on the ballot. Michigan is different, because Obama was not on the ballot there. I think, though, that Howard Dean is right that once the party issued its decision not to seat the delegates chosen in those primaries, they probably need to stick to that. I think they are going to have to come up with some way to seat delegates from both Michigan and Florida, probably by holding a do-over. \n \n The Democratic Party certainly has made a tangle of the nominating process with its rules that keep the outcome up in the air. I think the biggest reason for this is the proportional allocation of delegates, which in a sense is fair to all candidates but prevents the party from coming up with a clear winner. We Americans are used to winner-take-all elections; we are not used to this kind of system. We would probably be in quite a different situation if we had winner-take-all state primary races. Hillary might actually be on top, because she has won the votes in the big states with the most delegates. But because of the proportional allocation, and the relative closeness of the races, no one candidate can command a substantial lead in delegates. Even when a candidate loses, he or she wins delegates.\n \n I read one op ed piece yesterday, in the Washington Post I believe, that argued that this extended primary season actually benefits the Democrats, not the Republicans. The writer noted that the ongoing battle keeps the Democrats in the news and keeps Democratic voters interested, while McCain has to try to come up with ways to generate news and keep himself visible and keep Republicans motivated. The writer also argued that the attacks by the Democrats on each other, so long as they do not go overboard, will actually help the Democratic nominee, because these are the attacks that the Republicans will make. The Democratic candidates can practice responding to these attacks in their back-and-forth with each other before the Republicans get a chance to attack the Democratic nominee. It's an interesting argument.",
