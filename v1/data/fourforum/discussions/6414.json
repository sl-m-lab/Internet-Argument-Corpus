   "Man admits 'honour killing' of his sister\n By A Correspondent\n \n \n \n THE youngest of three Turkish brothers charged with murdering their sister in a so-called honour killing has admitted that he pulled the trigger, but as the trial opened in a Berlin state court yesterday he insisted that he acted alone. \n Hatun Surucu, 25, was killed in February by three shots to the head on a street near her home. The case outraged Germans and brought to light the honour killings and forced marriages among the nation's Turkish population. \n \n \n \n According to prosecutors, Ms Surucu's brothers lured her to a bus stop with the intent of killing her because they were ashamed of her Western lifestyle. \"I killed my sister,\" Ayhan Surucu, 19, said in a statement read by his lawyer. He said that he regretted the act and insisted that his two older brothers were not involved. \n \n Mutlu Surucu, 26, who has German citizenship, and Alpaslan Surucu, 24, a Turkish citizen, as is his younger brother, pleaded not guilty. All three face charges of second-degree murder. \n \n Hatun was a German citizen, born and brought up in Berlin, but was forced to return to Turkey to marry a cousin in 1998. A year later she gave birth to a son in Berlin and refused to return with her husband to Turkey, prosecutors said.\n \n \n \n \n http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-1780748,00.html\n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1332 Islamic Honour Killing: Muslim Woman Forced to Drink Poison for Seeing Christian Man \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1315 Islamic Honour Killing: Five Family Members Gunned Down \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1313 34 Islamic Honour Killings in Lahore This Year \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1285 The Fascism of Shariah: Islamic Court Orders Man to be Surgically Blinded \n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1257\n Female Genital Mutiliation is an 'Honour'\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1255\n Islamic Honour Killings in review\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1253\n Islamic Honour Killing in the UK\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1248\n Islamic Honour Killing For Phone Photo\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1244\n Islamic Honour Killing in Amsterdam\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1243\n 'Every minute in the world a woman is raped, and she\n has no one to blame but herself\"\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1241\n Islamic Honour Killing in Broad Daylight: Woman\n walking with fiance murdered\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1236\n Veiled Threat\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1223\n Islamic Honour Killing: Brother Murders Sister Raped\n and Impregnated by Father\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1208\n Islamic Honour Killing in Germany, Muslim Students\n Cheer Act\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1142\n Over 100 unsolved Islamic honour killing cases could\n be reopened in the UK\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/966\n Islamic Honour Killings: Brother Rapes Sister, Parents\n Kill Her\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/937\n Rape victim marries her rapist to avoid Muslim shun\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/820\n Islamic Honour Killing in Norway\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/497\n Islamic Honour Killing of Teen Rape Victim\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/480\n Burned alive: A harrowing tale of a failed honour\n killing\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/203\n Islamic Honour Killing Confession Caught on Tape\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/146\n Gang Rapists Defense: Cultural Relativism\n \n See also:\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/113\n Islamic Honour Killing: Brother gets 4 months for\n killing sister",

But the issues and topics he chooses as his troll bait are certainly topics that deserve attention and should not be swept under the rug, censored, or discussed in low-breath.\n Speaking generally, of course......\n\n Agreed.\n \nI think that exposing the archaic beliefs and customs that are common amongst people of the Islam faith and the middle east, at large, helps to educate others as to just what kind of society we are going to be forced into dealing with as the world continues to steer towards globalism.\n\n Archaic? Who sets the standards? Are the beliefs of Christianity, an older religion, also archaic? I support educating ourselves (as well as \"others\") in an honest effort to learn the truth, not to support a preconceived notion. \n \nAre we sure we want to play ball with these kind of people on an on-going basis?\n\n I am not sure what \"play ball\" means here. If you mean should we attempt to peacefully coexist and improve relations with the fastest growing religion on earth (\"these kind of people\"), it would be foolish not to. \n \n We are from Venus and they are from Mars. Sometimes it seems that the only thing we have in common with them is that we are all classified as physically human beings and happen to reside on the same planet. We are worlds apart from them idealogically. \n\n Really? I believe MOST practitioners (real or alleged) of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddism and Hinduism all have a lot in common, and that the education mentioned will bear this out. I am not referring to radicals who distort their religion to justify evil. Islamic terrorism no more represents Islam than did the KKK represent Christianity.\n \nPersonally, because we are, in fact, living in a country often referred to as the melting pot, I am one that would prefer to not mix their particular ingredient into our society. I would have no objection to them doing whatever they want to do on their side of the world and doing what it takes to keep them there. I just wish our government would feel the same way.\n\n Archie Bunker would be proud! Just what \"particular ingredient\" are you referring to? There are 6 million Muslims in the U.S.. They come from over 60 African, Asian, European and Middle Eastern nations; they are immigrants, refugees and many have been here for generations. Regardless of your preference, their \"ingredient\" is part of our society.\n You said that these topics deserve attention. I submit that they deserve objective consideration.\n Dono",

If I moved to their land, I would expect that I honor their beliefs and customs. I would ask the same if they chose to live here. So far, I really have nothing against the Muslims I have known here in America. So as far as the idea that a few extremists of Islam do not represent the group as a whole, I can handle.

I would bet they are already here.\n\n I have been here over three score and ten and I have never had a Muslim try to convert me. I have had hundreds of Christians make the try at my door, on the street, on TV, and even at sporting events. You are correct, extremism is growing and the wise will ask, \"Why is that happening and what can we do to stop it\". We are perceived in many places as \"the great Satan\", bent on another Crusade against Islam. Instead of trying to change that perception, we collectively view Islam, the world's fastest growing religion, as a \"back-wooded religion\". Of course, a unilateral invasion of a sovereign Muslim country that did not attack us didn't help (another thread). You can bet your boots \"they are already here\", and the greatest impediment to their recruiting comes from the 6 million loyal American Muslims, not from those who lump all in their \"back-wooded\" religion together. It is always wise to know your enemy and to have the ability to separate them from your friends. That takes some effort and dedication.\n \n \nAnd yes, I conceed that my opinion does sound a bit like Archie Bunker and that is not like me at all.

   "As with most religions, there are both extremists (that jsaid2009 points out) and the moderates. Of course, we cannot generalize our opinions of an entire religion - Islam in this case - based on the extremists but neither can we ignore them as a fringe aberation since they seem to hold a very disproportionate voice and influence in Islamic society. \n \n Their willingness to use ruthless tactics to push their cause often seems to leave the moderates too afraid to speak out against them. This is something that scares me about the Islamic world. If the silent majority is indeed moderate, then why don't we hear more from them? Are they frightened into silence? If so, then extremist ideas might spread simply because moderate voices are silent.",
