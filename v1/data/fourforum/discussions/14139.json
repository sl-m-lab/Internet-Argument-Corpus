   "Wow, basically they are quite simply admitting that they are out to deceive and lie via exaggeration. The fact that such opposition to fiscal conservatism is getting desperate is another sign of the grass-roots sea change that's taking place in this country.\n \n \"Opponents of the fiscally conservative tea party movement say they plan to infiltrate and dismantle the political group by trying to make its members appear to be racist, homophobic and moronic.\n \n Jason Levin, creator of Crash The Tea Party!, said Monday the group has 65 leaders in major cities across the country who are trying to recruit members to infiltrate tea party events for April 15&#8212;tax filing day, when tea party groups across the country are planning to gather and protest high taxes.\n \n \"Every time we have someone on camera saying that Barack Obama isn't an American citizen, we want someone sitting next to him saying, 'That's right, he's an alien from outer space!'\" Levin said.\n \n Tea party members said the backlash comes from ignorance.\n \n \"They can't actually debate our message and that's their problem,\" said Bob MacGuffie, a Connecticut organizer for Right Principles, a tea party group that also has members in New York and New Jersey.\n \n The tea party movement generally unites on the fiscally conservative principles of small government, lower taxes and less spending. Beyond that the ideology of the people involved tends to vary dramatically.\n \n Levin says they want to exaggerate the group's least appealing qualities, further distance the tea party from mainstream America and damage the public's opinion of them.\n \n \"Do I think every member of the tea party is a homophobe, racist or a XXXXX? No, absolutely not,\" Levin said. \"Do I think most of them are homophobes, racists or XXXXXX? Absolutely.\"\n \n The site manifesto says they want to dismantle the Tea Party by nonviolent means. \"We have already sat quietly in their meetings, and observed their rallies,\" the site said.\n \n Another tea party organizer said the attempt to destroy the movement was evidence its message is resonating.\n \n \"We've been ignored, we've been ridiculed. Well, now they're coming after us,\" said Judy Pepenella, a co-coordinator for the New York State Tea Party. \"Gandhi's quote is one we understand: 'First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, then you win.'\" - Foes of tea party movement to infiltrate rallies",

Instead the healthcare bill was more like a way to force poor people to buy healthcare insurance. It probably benefited the healthcare companies in the short run (and as we know corporations tend to see about 6months in front of their face) and drug companies. Has Obama done more in 1 year than Bush did in 8? Well not yet but he is on path to do more than Bush did to screw us over financially. \n \n The fact that the TEA party didn't exist during the Bush years is exactly why I am a little skeptical of them. I mean not much has changed yet only now do we see people being upset. If republicans are back in office is the tea party going to just say \"well, that's good enough\". This remains to be seen. Does the tea party support the only path to get us into fiscal responsibility? This path is higher taxes lower spending. BOTH, not just one. Sadly we have to pay for the sins of the baby boomers. I don't see many tea party activists hoping for this.\n \n Daewoo may be a little pessimistic (no offense ha) at times but I'm not and when I'm a little skeptic...I worry :)",

Already we're seeing fallout here and here from this is causing enormous damage.\n \n \n Instead the healthcare bill was more like a way to force poor people to buy healthcare insurance.\n\n \n Exactly. That's the point.\n \n \nThe fact that the TEA party didn't exist during the Bush years is exactly why I am a little skeptical of them. I mean not much has changed yet only now do we see people being upset. If republicans are back in office is the tea party going to just say \"well, that's good enough\". This remains to be seen. Does the tea party support the only path to get us into fiscal responsibility? This path is higher taxes lower spending. BOTH, not just one. Sadly we have to pay for the sins of the baby boomers. I don't see many tea party activists hoping for this.\n\n \n IMO the fact that Bush basically lost all moderate and centrist support from Republicans for the most part (only keeping the Bush die-hards) is indicative that many of the people who would largely later make up the TEA party did at least stop supporting him. I mean Republicans for most part no longer supported the Iraq war and he was getting to where he was being criticized by members of his own party for the fiscal problems. It's true they didn't get as vocal until Obama starting taking things so much to the left, but I think that sort of sent them 'over the edge' so to speak, to where they were ready to form a protest movement. Again, Obama has effectively 'taken over' a lot of the private sector at this point in a way that we have never really seen. We really are in uncharted territory here. \n Again, if you are for limited government, keeping taxes low, and limiting spending, you are basically a 'TEA partier', whether you know it or not, because those are your values. You may not be at these rallies, but the values are the same. I think people get a little 'scared' of what appears to be organized movements, even if they are for good values. Yes, Republicans have embraced the TEA party, but that is because their values of fiscal responsibility falls more in line with the Republican platform and message. That is what I was trying to get across to Daewoo, rather than indicating that actions don't matter, which was a strawman he created to respond to. I think that if Republicans get back in office the TEA party will not INITIALLY oppose them because they are, quite simply, the party that espouses fiscal conservatism more than the other. (Even if Bush deviated from this.) But if they start acting like Democrats and start blowing money and over-spending, then yes, I think they will protest again. Just as many Republicans abandoned support for Bush.\n \n \nDaewoo may be a little pessimistic (no offense ha) at times but I'm not and when I'm a little skeptic...I worry :)\n\n \n I know. I'm a skeptic at times too. But we can't let skepticism--and worse, cynicism--be the controlling factor. At some point we have give credit where credit is due even if that means saying one party did something right while the other didn't.",

Writing a very, very large check and turnign Bushs entire administration over to the Iraqis for a war crimes trial would probably do it. \n \n \n See, you keep bringing up Bush, but some of us find it odd that (given you were SO critical of Bush) your rhetoric over Obama just hasn't been there nearly as much, given how much government has become entangled with the private sector in such a short time.\n \n \n Then you are an ID10T. I have opposed almost all of Obamas insane spending. If you are really going to try to make me out as some kind of closet Obama supporter you have apparently already had that lobotomy. \n \n \nI think you're one of those people who like to put on an air of independent criticism, but in reality you're not so independent as you like to think. Because if you were, you'd be at least just as outraged as you were with Bush was in office.\n\n \n Instead I am MORE outraged. Not for the same reasons as you, since I actually take the time to look beyond the talking points...\"the message\". The up side to that is that my reasons for outrage actually make sense. \n \n \nTo address your point about message versus actions, of course I look at actions, probably more than you do. The fact that I brought up the issue of message doesn't mean I don't look at actions. There's no action in the tea party that leads me to believe they truly aren't for limited government and fiscal responsibility. The TEA party didn't even exist as an organized entity during the Bush years so it's not really fair to hold the previous administration against it when it didn't even exist.\n\n \n WRONG. Go to a teabagger rally. Suggest we cut the military by 40%. Let me know how that turns out for you.\n \n That is the ABSOLUTE minimum we can cut our military and still have a solvent nation in 2015. What you see the teabaggers whining about is social programs like food stamps, and the health care overhaul, and other programs that basically amount to pocket change. Most of them do not seem to be interested in fiscal responsibility at all. They are just using it to push an agenda. \n \n \nNevertheless, if you're someone who is for more limited govt, less spending, keeping taxes low, and frustrated with how Washington IS spending, you basically ARE a TEA partier. You may not attended protests, but you are one in terms of values. I think people like you just have sour grapes because there are actually people standing up now and exercising their right to protest. You should be commending them. But the uber-cynics like yourself are always going to look down on such a movement just on the basis that it came mostly from one political party, and that it's somewhat organized (though very loosely).\n\n \n Nope. I am down on them because their rhetoric makes no sense. They are mud slingers pretending to be fiscal conservatives. No more, no less.\n \n What is worse, they are probably going to cost the republicans the chance to take back congress. They are going to split the conservative/moderate conservative vote and hand the election to the democrats. This is the same way we ended up with Clinton as president. Ross Perot split the republican/conservative vote and Bush, who was considered a shoe in prior to Perot running, lost.",
