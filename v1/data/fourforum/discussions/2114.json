   "Continuing my Dman style \"carpet posting\" from the truth seeking b-52 of righteousness...\n \n Wednesday, Apr. 07, 2004 10:41 AM EDT\n Kerry: Terrorist Shiite Al-Sadr 'A Legitimate Voice'\n \n In an interview broadcast Wednesday morning, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry defended terrorist Shiite imam Moqtada al-Sadr as a \"legitimate voice\" in Iraq, despite that fact that he's led an uprising that has killed nearly 20 American GIs in the last two days.\n \n Speaking of al-Sadr's newspaper, which was shut down by coalition forces last week after it urged violence against U.S. troops, Kerry complained to National Public Radio, \"They shut a newspaper that belongs to a legitimate voice in Iraq.\"\n \n In the next breath, however, the White House hopeful caught himself and quickly changed direction, adding, \"Well, let me . . . change the term legitimate. It belongs to a voice - because he has clearly taken on a far more radical tone in recent days and aligned himself with both Hamas and Hezbollah, which is a sort of terrorist alignment.\"\n \n But Kerry again seemed to voice sympathy for the Shiite terrorist when asked whether he supported al Sadr's arrest. \"Not if it's an isolated act without the other kinds of steps necessary to change the dynamics on the ground in Iraq,\" Kerry told NPR, in quotes first reported by the New York Sun.\n \n \"If all we do is make war against the Iraqi people and continue an American occupation, fundamentally, without a clarity as to who and how sovereignty is being turned over, we have a very serious problem for the long run here,\" Kerry added. \"And I think this administration is just walking dead center down into that trap.\"\n \n On March 28, the U.S.-led coalition authorities closed al-Sadr's newspaper, al-Hawza, for 60 days, the Sun reported. L. Paul Bremer, the chief U.S. administrator in Iraq, charged that said the newspaper had published false stories blaming the coalition forces for local acts of terrorism.",

The point is that he said the guy was a legitamate voice for the Iraqi people. I do not think that Kerry is right but I do see merit in your paragraph but you got to remember this is one city one guy in a big country and he does not speak for the majority. My point in this topic is to show the LONG history of troop harming activites that the good senator has engaged in...",
