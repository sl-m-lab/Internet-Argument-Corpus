They are working to confine the rioting to a single area, and waiting for it to burn itself out. This is the same thing the LAPD did with the LA riots. They let the rioters have part fo the city and tried to keep it contained there.

The whole thing is just idiotic and has been a failure everywhere it has ever been tried.

Please keep in mind that Americans do not travel, preferring instead to stay at home and marvel at our superior culture and lifestyle (though how they know it is superior since they have never seen anything else I cannot explain).\n \n As such, many, if not most, Americans tend tot think of \"Europe\" as a country, with the individual countries assigned status similar to statehood here in the US.\n \n AS such, it is difficult for many to grasp the fact that riots in Paris are tantamount to if we tuned on the news tomorrow and saw \"riots in Quebec\". Interesting, but any suggestion that N America was in flames would be pathetic.\n \n Just to clarify for Americans:\n \n Paris is a city in France, which is a country in Europe. People in Paris are rioting because the frogs have never done a good job of integrating immigrants, preferring to stick them in slums and treat them like second class citizens. \n \n The people are likely rioting for 3 reasons:\n \n 1. They are tired of being treated as second class citizens\n 2. They are tired of living in the slums\n 3. It is fun to riot, loot, and pillage. \n \n Thisi s not a religous war.

That is just my opinion, of course, after spending a little time in that dump of a city. More than once I had the impulse to grab a Frenchman and throttle him, and I was only there for three weeks. If I had to live there, I would burn the place to the ground, too.\n\n \n It is both a class and religious war.
