   "For me, personally, God is one being, one person in that of Jesus Christ. I cannot separate Him into three parts or the unity of three. Even though the Bible says, &#8220;Father, Son and Holy Ghost,&#8221; I can feel only one. In our attempt to see how He works, how He feels, how He is we try to establish some sort of human attributes to His majesty. In doing so I&#8217;m afraid we have divisions or denominations of faith.\n He has performed miracles in my life, so He is a Miracle worker. He has setup His government in my life, so He is the Authority. He has brought peace to my life and in my family, so He is a Peacemaker. He has brought me joy, so He is my Delight. He has fulfilled his Word, so He is a Promise keeper. He has given me strength, so He is my Power. He has changed my life from evil to good, depression to pleasure, failure to success, so He is the Almighty. He saved my soul, so He is my Savior.\n All that I am I owe to Him for He shows me daily that He loves and cares for me. I can&#8217;t see how I lived so long without Him, but am glad that He made Himself known to me. I wondered about Him, doubted Him and denied Him, but still He made Himself known to me and for that I am grateful.\n He is my Lord and my God; that is who God is&#8230;to me.",
