The only problem with it is that it's a complete load, useful only to justify governments doing what they love to do - expand, regulate and waste money.\n \n The actions taken during the \"great depression\" actually prolonged it, which is why in every previous depression, where little or no action was taken, the depression was short lived and mild.\n \n The longer the government prevents the market from righting itself the worse this will get. Had there been no bailout, we'd be looking at a recovery early next year. As it currently stands the government is keeping the living dead banks and auto industries around, sucking the life out of the productive economy.\n \n Notice how each week, we have a new scheme to spend loads of money to \"fix\" the economy. The next, we hear that it wasn't nearly enough, and we need far, far more. Guess what? It will NEVER be enough. The economy will ALWAYS \"need more\".

They spent large amounts on new bridges people really didn't use or on new roads when the originals were fine. Or new expansions to subways that only slightly reduced congestion. What Obama's plan for the most part (I'll agree that there is plenty of irrelevant #### in it) is to spend it on infrastructure that needs it. Our roads, sewage, electrical and mass transit are in bad state of affairs. Comparing a country with good systems that didn't need such massive additional spending to us, whose has bridged, roads, highways, sewer systems, electrical lines all dating back to the 50s isn't fair or honest.

If the spending to infrastructure can increase efficiency as well as allow expansion, it may actually work. Especially if it's bringing out public schools into the 21st century. It really comes down to how they spend it. If they spend it on stupid #### like sports centers, then we're pretty much screwed. But if they spend it on highly efficient energy transfer grids, high tech schools, mass transit and high capacity roads, that's entirely another story. I do believe that some cities included renewable energy proposals. That ALONE could spark huge amounts of innovation and manufacturing to meet the demand. Again, it really comes down to how they spend it. My biggest problem with the spending plan, outside of its cost is the failure to remove cost ineffective proposals. \n \n \nAnd as for the zombie banks...I'm not sure what your point is with this as I haven't read what you are referring to but we are supporting failing banks...that was the goal of the first 700 billion bailout.\n\n \n Not really.

This is not only evidenced by Japan but by our own country in the 30s where GDP went up thanks to government spending but the second it stopped the economy tanked again.\n \n \nNot really. Japan's infrastructure at the time wasn't bad. They spent large amounts on new bridges people really didn't use or on new roads when the originals were fine. Or new expansions to subways that only slightly reduced congestion. What Obama's plan for the most part (I'll agree that there is plenty of irrelevant #### in it) is to spend it on infrastructure that needs it. Our roads, sewage, electrical and mass transit are in bad state of affairs. Comparing a country with good systems that didn't need such massive additional spending to us, whose has bridged, roads, highways, sewer systems, electrical lines all dating back to the 50s isn't fair or honest. I recently went to Japan. Even the roads out to the country are brand spanking new and in excellent condition. Can't say that about the roads here. \nWhether we need it or not is irrelevant to whether it makes economic sense or not given that the plan is to take on a huge debt. I have long sense said that infrastructure upgrades are good investments for a country but not when you using it to jump start an economy...even more so when you use debt to finance it. Think of it as buying a home you couldn't afford and then taking on more debt to fix it up so so it functions better. Now think of that when no one is buying homes (this is a metaphor and not specific to anything current). That is basically the situation we have now and what Obama's plan is. \n \n \nThat depends. If the spending to infrastructure can increase efficiency as well as allow expansion, it may actually work. Especially if it's bringing out public schools into the 21st century.\nThere is little evidence to show this works, if any. We built a number of needed infrastructures in the 30s but it didn't help the long term picture. On the plus side with that, we actually didn't take on that much debt (in comparison). You add in the fact that we are doing this with debt and you just delay a problem for the future. You can't fix a debt problem with more debt.\n \n \n It really comes down to how they spend it.\nI disagree. It comes down to how you solve an economic problem of debt. Is it to create more debt or to let values adjust naturally. \n \n Bailouts by a government have never ever worked yet we always try and come up with different excuses to why the last time didn't work.\n \n \nNot really. Zombie banks were banks in Japan that had huge amounts of non-performing loans that were given government money merely to stay alive. There were effectively no regulations or required reforms. That's not the case here. In some ways, enforcing M2M is preventing us from going down that path.\nMark to market is a bad idea for the exact opposite reasons everyone hates it now. Without getting into a boring accounting lesson (being as that is what I do) it is more of a problem when times are good than when times are bad. In fact, it is extremely accurate when times are bad.\n \n Again, the US is bailing out the banks. Just from today the of the $700 billion: \"$187.5 billion provided to banks in an effort to get them to resume more normal lending\". Paulson has already stated he wants to buy up some of the bad debt or rather \"insure\" it. Who can keep up though since it changes every week it seems.",

   "Can Corporate Capitalism function in a society without internal and external stability and security? Can it function when the framework for market capitalism doesn't exist? Can it function efficiently when corporations are required to pay for all of the infrastructure necessary to do what they do? Meaning pay and build all of the roads, the sewage and water lines, electrical lines, and harbors/airports? \n \n Keynesian Policies are far more then merely government spending to get out of a recession.\nI think India and China and some other countries answered this question as \"yes they can\" because many companies do. However, infrastructure does provide ease for companies and like many things in nature you take the least obstructive path. Companies are willing to build the roads and put in the pipes if labor cost is too high though...thus outsourcing. \n \n Also, many railroads are built by corporations.\n \n I don't think Keynesian policies can be described as any government intervention in the country. It is more of using government to stimulate an economy and business creation. I think this goes a little far. Government is more about benefiting the citizens than business. So it is more indirect than Keynesian implies.",

This was mainly because tanks were not in demand anymore but like you said, when the US was the only available producer they thrived!\n\n \n You have to admit, though, that the targeted war spending (requiring the ability to be converted rapidly to peace time production for war time factory construction, etc...) was pretty effective. \n \n The post WWII recession was relatively light, all things considered. \n \n Last Nail in the Coffin | Money and Markets: Free Investment Email Newsletter\n \n \nThe 2009 federal deficit will be $1.186 trillion! Even after adjusting for inflation, that's more than the combined cost of the Vietnam War ($698 billion) and the Korean War ($454 billion) ... 4.6 times more than the entire S&L bailout of the 1980s ... and 5.5 times larger than the Louisiana Purchase:\n \n In sheer dollars, the 2009 federal deficit will shatter every record deficit of every nation in history. \n \n Already, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the federal deficit has ballooned to $485 billion, an unprecedented increase of 353% compared to the previous year. If it continues to grow at that pace, it will make all the above estimates look small by comparison.\n \n\n \n That is JUST the deficit, and that prediction relies on some pretty dodgy assumptions:\n \n \n \nThe CBO implicitly assumes that the debt crisis is largely behind us - no more big bank failures, no more GMs or Chryslers, no more international debt defaults and no Wall Street meltdown. But the very size of its own deficit projection - reaching 10% of GDP - makes that assumption highly questionable.\n \n 2. The CBO assumes that federal revenues will remain relatively stable at 17.6% of GDP, only slightly below the 18.3% historical average. That means there can be no depression, no unemployment disaster, no tsunami of corporate red ink and no plunge in federal tax revenues.\n \n \"Just make believe those events can never happen!\" goes the rationale.\n \n What about the government data showing that the unemployment disaster is already here? \"Largely ignore that, too,\" seems to be the underlying theme.\n \n 3. The CBO assumes that the economy will recover after 2009, and the government will get most of its bailout money back. For the TARP program, for example, the assumption is that the cost will be only 25% of the total amount loaned or invested. The remaining 75%, it figures, will be paid or earned back. \n \n",
