   "I'm not sure what your point is here. Are you actually blaming people who are pro-choice for the grissly lot of very poor women who choose abortion because they cannot afford to have a child? That is quite suprising given that it is the Democratic party (largely pro-choice) that is the one most supportive of social programs along the lines of what you suggest and the Republican party (largely pro-life) who limits aid to such women (all of those accusations of \"tax and spend\" liberals come to mind). Otherwise, are you blaming the poor women for choosing abortion because they cannot afford to have a child and you discount that as a reason? Please make your point more clearly.\n\n \n Not all social programs work, some do some don't.\n \n As for the Democrats and Republicans, I am neither, however, when it comes to democrats and their \"social progams\" half the time, they are pitiful attempts of ??? god knows what.\n \n Lets be real, there is so much red tape in politics, both sides have their hands in the pockets of the lobbyist, labor union, ect., its just disgusting. Case in point, a recent issue: mininum wage \n \n Text from Ted Kennedy.\n \n The bill I favor would raise it to $5.65 right away, $6.75 a year from now, and $7.25 two years from now. Again and again, however, our Republican colleagues have refused to give minimum wage workers any raise at all, let alone the raise they deserve\n \n RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS\n \n \u0095 The Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour in three steps: \n \n \u0095 $5.85 60 days after enactment; \u0095 $6.55 one year later; \u0095 $7.25 one year after that\n \n \u0095 Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earn $10,700 a year, $4,500 below the poverty line for a family of three. Since Congress last acted to raise the minimum wage in 1996, the value has eroded by 18 percent.\n \n \u0095 Every day the minimum wage is not increased it continues to lose value, and workers fall farther and farther behind.\n \n AND THIS ONE MAKES ME LAUGH THE MOST\n \n  To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage would have to be more than $8.50 an hour today, not $5.15. \n \n who in the heck is crunching those number?! We had way more buying power in the 60s with minimum wage. Today, Buying power at $8.50...WHAT?????????\n \n Come on people wake up, impeach all of our elected officials and let's start from scratch. \n \n As much as I appreciate democrats for wanting a higher minimum wage, for the federal employees, placing the poor just above poverty, its a freaking slap in the face, it's a darn joke. Oh but don't get me started with the republican party right before dinner, I'll lose my appetite.\n \n Then again, I could be wrong! Maybe $8.50 an hour IS buying power. \n \n I dare the democrats to put their balls back on and push for $15.00 an hour. $15.00 an hour for a 40 hour week is only $31,200 yearly and that is gross literally, and guess what that equates to in many areas of the U.S; a \"living wage\", moreso than $5.85, or $6.55, or $7.25 that the under-achieving democrats want.\n \n Don't get me wrong, I'm happier with the Dems than the Republicans on this issue, but its so unfortanate that both parties are bought by lobbyist.\n \n Doesn't anyone see the whole picture and what is happening to our workforce. We let corporations get away with paying less by reducing the full-time employee and more part-time employees, which equates to less pay and less benefits, we let corporations all but remove from existance the pension system for a less favorable 401Ks, or offer nothing. Woohoo nothing.\n \n It used to be, you worked your youthful life (until the 50s or 60s) and come the retirement years, the company's retirement plan, along with social security let you live a decent retirement, nowadays, you work all your youthful life and come retirement, there is no residual income from the company(ies) you were loyal to, and to boot, your social security isn't enough to make ends meet. Your prescription coverage is all messed up and you are financially strapped. \n \n I personally don't blame the general public for this mess, our dear friends in politics and their buddies who have special interest, screwed us over, from the left and the right. Thanks.\n \n As in the other thread, talking about minimum wage, we the people need to take a hard line to the politicians and their special interest buddies and not adjust the already over-inflated payscales that some unions have gotten.\n \n Remember, John Kennedy and his speech. I'm paraphrasing here: Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. \n \n Our fellow countrymen, who are not lazy, work long hard hours and are still at the poverty level need us to help them. \n \n Let's bring the working-poor up to par, but that doesn't mean for those who make a decent living already to cry for more. We need to give our fair share. That is what America is all about...isn't it?",

   "$31,200 is a lot of money, that's what? About GBP17000? That's far more than a living wage, especially given that cost of living in the US is less than it is over here. I would suggest that $10-11 is a more resonable target. The alternative is to require that any organisation must maintain a certain maximum ratio of highest wage to lowest wage 10:1 or even 20:1 will have considerable impact in wages for the lowest paid.

At least its better than nothing. I'm sure that, as you say, the power of lobbies plays a large role as well but we are stuck with that system (unless we all volunteer to give, say, $100 per person for election funding in order to be able to restrict lobbyist donations). \n \nI personally don't blame the general public for this mess, our dear friends in politics and their buddies who have special interest, screwed us over, from the left and the right.

That is what America is all about...isn't it?\n\n Many if not most politicians may be bought off and not working for the average American but people do have to realize that we are the ones that voted them in and are letting them get away with it. I think there is a lot of complacency on the part of most Americans - lower and middle class - when it comes to the rights of the poor and underpriviledged since people buy into the American Dream and actually think that they do have a non-negligable chance of getting rich themselves so they feel a certain sympathy toward the rich because they think that they could be reach that level with hard work and education. They are deluding themselves. Apparently, there weren't many people who objected to the repeal of the estate tax mostly for such reasons. If they concentrated on the rights of their own socio-economic class (and I'm not talking communist class-warfare here, just simple common sense), then they might actually find the government working in their favor for a change. People have to vote based on their interest and the interest of those they think deserve consideration, not vote on red herring issues such as gay marriage, etc. How else can we change things if not through intelligent voting?",

   "my figure is right on the money :) Give or take a dollar.\n \n Listen, politicians and analysts distort the data most of the time. For example any given US President will stand before his public and say \"we've created 4 million jobs, the economy is good (pssst, but they forget to inform you they lost 6 million jobs the year before under the same administration)\n \n So people think hey we got a real good president here, and that is not that case, he lost 2 million jobs, but they will have you believe that he created 6 million. It's BS.\n \n When a president stands before you and says we've had a surplus in the budget for 4 years, one would think, hell, we are doing darn good emoticon_xhoho , but its political mumbo jumbo, in no time since we started our national deficit was it ever EVER reduced, but the general population thinks hey we had a surplus for 4 years, our deficit must be way down, but nope, its all distorting data to fool the general public.\n \n So when someone tells you, well, if you take the Consumer Index Number and multiply it to the presidents birthday, you will see we are better off now than in the 60s. You see it's all smoke and mirrors on their \"theories\" and how they calculate things. \n \n I live in reality and the reality is money equal opportunity, and to obtain opportunities you need money.\n \n What's one of the typical american dream. Owning a home. Lets go back in time shall we.\n \n I bought a house in 1995 and the minimum wage was 4.25 which equals $8,840 for the year and for me to pay that amount off, it would have taken 12 3/4 years to pay that principal amount.\n \n The person I bought that house from bought it in 1969 for 14,000 \n minimum wage was 1.60 equals 3328 for the year and to pay off that house would have been paid off in 4 1/4 years\n \n that same house is going for 350,000 now and with a minimum wage of 5.15 which is 10,712 a year, and to pay off the house it would have taken me 32 years.\n \n And they (our politicians) say we had less buying power in the 60s. I don't think so!!!!\n \n Remember Clinton's last year in office, not to make you cry or anything, but gas was 99 cents a gallon, now its over 3 dollars a gallon.\n \n Our dollar is stretched thin, more than ever before, these are real numbers and not some ficticious equation analyst think up that are inaccurate and not the true financial strain the people are feeling.\n \n So the next time, you see a market analyst spouting, \"hey if you adjust for inflations, gas was much much more expensive in the 80s\" cuss him/her out for me.\n \n Now, back to my 15.00 an hour. Remember that house above and with 15 dollars an hour, that is 31,200 for the year and it will take you 11 1/4 years to pay off. Now that is an adjustment people can actually live with and call it a \"living wage\". \n \n You know the working poor need to make a Living wage people, anything less than 13 dollars is not a LIVING wage. Living for what? Not being able to afford the american dream?",

I am not citing an idea, I am stating a fact with empirical evidence to back it up. In my industry, few are paid the absolute minimum wage, but many are paid some derivative of the mininum wage. If a manager is currently paid twice the minumum wage, he will want to retain that relationship or suffer a perceived reduction in his wage. The entire scale does rise. There are many artful methods of disguising price increases. I'll stick with McDonalds here. Examine the menu changes that have surrounded minimum wage hikes in the past: the introduction of new sandwiches, the restructuring of \"meal deals\", the slight reduction in the size of a filet of fish sandwich, etc. They must and do maintain labor costs at a consistant percentage of sales. It may happen over some protracted time frame, but it will happen. Entry level wages commonly purchase a relatively stable basket of goods. This basket of goods has risen in price in a pattern that tracks closely with the rise in the minumum wage. Sometimes slightly above the rate of rise for the wage, sometimes slightly below. The wage earner is no better off. In Canada, they now control the wage that dentists and doctors make on the high end. They are a step closer to slavery than we are. Is this what you want? How much should a 32 oz. coke cost anyway? How about a routine office visit to your family doctor? Please express your answers as a percentage of the daily \"living wage\", and have them approved by the National Price Equity Board.",

Due to our bloated standard of living driven by unrealistic wages we're in the process of migrating from an industrial to service economy, a debtor nation with one primary product of Petrodollar debt.

Normally when the price of a product increases, others go down or people switch to subsitutes. \n\n \n From a striclty technical standpoint, no. IF the supply decreases to the point that people seek replacements, the demand will fall until the price on the item in question falls to cometitive levels.\n \n The substitution effect was used for years to understate us inflation. The classic example is \"If steak is too expensive, people will switch to hamburger\". The problem with this is that you can carry it pretty far. If hamburger gets too expensive, you can switch to dog food...if dog food gets too expensive, you can switch to rats and squirels that you chase down and kill with a stick in your yard. \n \n Inflation is supposed to be calcualted using a FIXED basket of goods over a given period of time. \n \n \nWith gasoline you really don't have a subsitute and most products need gas to supply their product. So if gas goes up and no prices can go down to balance that increase does this force an increase in wages and thus inflation?\n\n \n Energy is a SERIOUS problem and should never have been eliminated from inflation calculations. They did so, switching from an inflation calculation to a \"core\" inflation calcualtion due to the oil spikes. The logic was that the prices were the result of short term supply side disruptions, so it would be foolish to base long term economic planning on numbers caused by a short term problem. At the time, that did make some sense. The problem is that after the supply shocks were over, they did not put energy back in there.\n \n Energy is without question the foundation upon which our economy is built. Attemptign to manage our economy without considering energy is just plain foolish. \n \n As far as energy pushign wages which pushes inflation, that has not been the case int he US for years. For years, wage have lost ground to inflation. minimum wage increases have had little or no effect on the economy as a whole. \n \n People get tripped up on this because from a simplistic viewpoint, wage increases should be directly tied to inflation. That is not the case thogh becuase of rising worker productivity. A guy making burgers at Mc Donalds today is mroe productive than one that worked there 30 years ago. 30 years ago, the burger maker stood there and flipped burgers. Today, that put them in the double sided cooking press thingy, clamp it down, and set the timer. While he is waiting for the timer to go off on the burgers, he can meander over and make some fries. Technological advancements have made us more productive (if not more skilled) at a rate that far exceeds the capital costs of that technology. The guy flipping burgers at McDonalds today can safely be paid 3 or 4 times as much (inflation adjusted) than the guy flipping burgers 30 years ago because the guy flipping burgers today is more productive than the guy 30 years ago.",

   "The US minimum wage in 1975 was $2.10/hr. In current purchasing power dollars, that's equivalent to $7.63/hr. If one considers that due to technology a current burger flipper is twice as productive as he/she was in 1975, the pay for flipping burgers should be $3.82/hr. But, that same labor quotient now produces French fries to justify the $7.63/hr. Simplistic, but we need someone like Matthew to tell us costs and productivity without divulging proprietary information. Perhaps the fries don't justify burger wages due to margins and retail prices and that person also makes coffee. Or vice-versa. \n \n What's a job worth? Some feel it should, by government decree, provide a living for the worker. One would have to be extremely frugal or hold more than one straight-time pay job to survive solely on the US minimum wage. So the question becomes at what standard should those who command minimum wage spend their lifes within society? As equals? As a capitalist, I find that a bit hard to digest, nor do I want them starving to death or they'll attack me. \n \n What should minimum wage buy in the exchange of personal contribution for society's benefits? I view it as forcing those fit and able but unable to increase their income to participate in wage sharing for residence and food purposes with a mate or other unassociated individuals in no limited number at that same income level. 503C clothing outlets disguised as charities offer inexpensive clothing and cable TV is a must for even the poor to keep them entertained now that they no longer read. How many to a residence? What about transportation? Obviously no personal vehicles for those living at minimum wage level and in the US, with inadequate public transportation outside maybe three major cities, that creates a new generation of workers in the US dependent on family and the government including the volunteer US military. \n \n I'd be interested in what other posters consider a standard of life that minimum wage should provide and the justifications.",

   "Given that the nature of our societies requires that some people will have to live their entire lives on minimum wage, then yes. In the UK minimum wage works out around GBP200/week. Take home pay then comes to about 171/week. Of this buying healthy food will set you back about GBP30. Transportation about GBP12 depending on how far you have to travel to work. Rent, bare minimum if you live in a shared house about GBP50, more likely GBP75 or more. I also forgot phone costs, about GBP3/week. Electricity and gas something in the order of GBP10-15/week. Clothing and shoes spread over the course of a long period of time about GBP2-3/week. You also realistically need to have home insurance, about GBP2/week. If you keep a very tight budget that comes to GBP106/week, assuming you don't have any debts from being unemployed, don't need to replace any furniture etc. A TV licence is also generally considered essential and will set you back another GBP3/week. Also you can pretty much double the rent if you live in London.\n \n Part of the problem is that a lot depends on how many people you need to support. Yes you can support one person on minimum wage in the UK, but a living wage means that working full time you should be able to support a family, even without any savings or luxuries, or even replacing essentials like clothing, it's virtually impossible.

   "A little historical consideration of minimum wage increases:\n \n http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&sid=atp2MiOAZ3Xc&refer=home\n \n Higher Minimum Wage No Longer Seen as Sure-Fire U.S. Job Killer \n Aug. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Prominent economists of all ideological persuasions long believed that raising the U.S. minimum wage would retard job growth, creating unintended hardship for those at the bottom of the ladder. \n \n Today, that consensus is eroding, and a vigorous debate has developed as some argue that boosting the wage would pull millions out of poverty. \n \n A moderate increase in the minimum wage won't raise unemployment among low-skilled workers, according to recent studies, many economists say. They are joined by some business executives who say they can live with that, especially if it's coupled with tax relief. \n \n \"My thinking on this has changed dramatically,'' says Alan Blinder, a former Federal Reserve vice chairman who teaches economics at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. \"The evidence appears to be against the simple-minded theory that a modest increase in the minimum wage causes substantial job loss.'' \n \n The debate over how to help struggling American workers was at the center of a battle in Congress last week over whether to increase the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour by 2009 from the current $5.15. The measure failed after Democrats objected that the wage increase had been linked to a plan to roll back the federal estate tax for many multimillion-dollar estates. \n \n Democrats said they would try to revive the measure before the November elections without the estate tax provision. \"The Senate won't adjourn until hard-working Americans get the help they need,'' said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. \n \n Keeping Pace \n \n Blinder and others note that the federal minimum wage, last raised in 1997, is at its lowest level in 50 years when adjusted for inflation. \n \n \"Workers' wages need to at least keep pace with inflation,'' says Andrew Puzder, chief executive officer of Carpinteria, California-based CKE Restaurants Inc., which owns the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurant chains. Puzder says he supports a reasonable increase in the minimum wage along with some form of tax relief for small businesses. \n \n In a Wells Fargo-Gallup poll taken in March, 46 percent of small-business owners said the minimum wage should be increased, and 86 percent said the wage had no effect on them. \n \n \"The wage has been left at such a low level for so many years now that inflation has eroded it,'' says Scott Anderson, a senior economist at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co., the fifth-biggest U.S. bank. \"It's not as onerous to employers as it once was.'' \n \n Traditional View \n \n Edward Lazear, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, says President George W. Bush is willing to work with Congress on finding ways to boost the minimum wage that won't significantly harm businesses. \"He's not opposed to changing the minimum wage, but it has to be done in a sensible way,'' Lazear said in a July 24 interview. \n \n Other economists still argue that the traditional view is right. \n \n \"The law of demand says simply that the higher the price of anything, the lower the quantity that will be taken,'' says William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the Washington-based National Federation of Independent Business. \"This law has never been incorrect in predicting market behavior.'' \n \n Most evidence suggests \"that a minimum wage increase causes some job loss among low-skilled workers,'' says David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine. Neumark has written studies critical of research casting doubt on that view and has testified before Congress against minimum-wage increases. \n \n Changing Views \n \n This view once was widespread. A 1978 American Economic Review survey found that 90 percent of economists said the minimum wage boosted unemployment among low-skilled workers. \n \n Today, that number would probably be cut in half, says Robert Solow, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge who won the 1987 Nobel Prize in economics. \n \n A turning point in the debate came in the 1990s as states such as New Jersey began boosting their mandated wages above the federal level. \n \n In 1995, Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger published research on unemployment trends among fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and neighboring Pennsylvania. They found that the number of jobs rose in New Jersey compared with Pennsylvania, even though New Jersey had a higher minimum wage. \n \n The study, while not perfect, \"provided evidence that went against the common view,'' Solow says. \"It changed the way many economists look at minimum wage.'' \n \n 'How Small the Effect' \n \n \"The debate now has become over how small the effect is as opposed to how large,'' says Arindrajit Dube, a labor economist at the University of California at Berkeley. \n \n Binder acknowledges that it's an \"intellectual puzzle'' why a boost in the minimum wage wouldn't lead to wider unemployment, because the economic laws of supply and demand dictate that it should. \n \n Explanations include cost savings from reduced job turnover, increased productivity as a result of better worker morale and the attraction of higher-quality employees through higher wages, Blinder says. \n \n To workers whose pay is at or near the minimum wage, raising it makes sense. \n \n \"I want a raise in the wage not just to boost me up, but because it will help us out as a country,'' says Sandy Mayes, a 39-year-old mother of four from Louisville, Kentucky, who says she sometimes takes minimum-wage jobs to supplement the $17,800 a year she earns as a teachers' assistant. \"Working in a school, I see parents who work themselves to death to live below average, and their kids suffer tremendously.'' \n \n Social Consequences \n \n A boost in the minimum wage would benefit about 15 million people, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research group partially funded by labor unions. Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the institute, estimates that the average minimum-wage worker generates 54 percent of his or her family's total weekly earnings. \n \n \"The social consequences of raising the wage have become increasingly important,'' says Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, former chief economist for the World Bank in Washington and now a professor at Columbia University in New York. \n \n Some economists say the 1997 increase had no impact on job growth. \n \n \"We saw no ripple effect at all in the unemployment rate,'' Stiglitz says. \"Unemployment just continued to go down.'' The minimum wage increase, he said, \"was totally swamped by other factors going on in the economy.''",

   "Now, I am not going to defend everything the oil companies do but I will say this. I did not hear any complaining when oil companies were trading oil for $20 a barrel and they were not making the profits like they are today. Even some took losses. But it is pay time for oil companies and they, like anyone would do, are going to ride it for all they can. \n \n Back to minimum wage, if it really were only a lowly worker that wanted a wage increase then I would say that it is no problem. But since all of them would be getting wage increases, the strain on small businesses would increase and many would operate at less than optimum efficiency.

   "OK, but it's perfectly hunky dory when the price-gauging oil companies raise the price of gasoline at the pump and their incredible profits, and run the costs of everything up, but when a lowly worker bumps his or her income up it totally screws up the economic picture?\n \n Go figure!\n\n \n Oil is a commodity with calculated finite production. Prices are currently driven by speculation based primarily on aggressive US foreign policy. Blame your government, not the oil companies. Gasoline is also a commodity with finite refining capacity. If you look at oil company ROIs, they're far below other industries. We're the largest single oil consumer with an economy based on oil. Consider the US a junkie without the ability to feed our own addiction and it has zero to do with minimum wage. \n \n The lowly worker needs to spend less time in front of the boob tube and more time in understanding who he/she casts a vote for. Any government making the unachievable promise of protecting its citizens while bankrupting a country should be an obvious fraud to even the lowest worker on the totem pole.

   "A little historical consideration of minimum wage increases:\n \n http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&sid=atp2MiOAZ3Xc&refer=home\n \n Higher Minimum Wage No Longer Seen as Sure-Fire U.S. Job Killer \n Aug. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Prominent economists of all ideological persuasions long believed that raising the U.S. minimum wage would retard job growth, creating unintended hardship for those at the bottom of the ladder. \n \n Today, that consensus is eroding, and a vigorous debate has developed as some argue that boosting the wage would pull millions out of poverty. \n \n A moderate increase in the minimum wage won't raise unemployment among low-skilled workers, according to recent studies, many economists say. They are joined by some business executives who say they can live with that, especially if it's coupled with tax relief. \n \n \"My thinking on this has changed dramatically,'' says Alan Blinder, a former Federal Reserve vice chairman who teaches economics at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. \"The evidence appears to be against the simple-minded theory that a modest increase in the minimum wage causes substantial job loss.'' \n \n The debate over how to help struggling American workers was at the center of a battle in Congress last week over whether to increase the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour by 2009 from the current $5.15. The measure failed after Democrats objected that the wage increase had been linked to a plan to roll back the federal estate tax for many multimillion-dollar estates. \n \n Democrats said they would try to revive the measure before the November elections without the estate tax provision. \"The Senate won't adjourn until hard-working Americans get the help they need,'' said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. \n \n Keeping Pace \n \n Blinder and others note that the federal minimum wage, last raised in 1997, is at its lowest level in 50 years when adjusted for inflation. \n \n \"Workers' wages need to at least keep pace with inflation,'' says Andrew Puzder, chief executive officer of Carpinteria, California-based CKE Restaurants Inc., which owns the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurant chains. Puzder says he supports a reasonable increase in the minimum wage along with some form of tax relief for small businesses. \n \n In a Wells Fargo-Gallup poll taken in March, 46 percent of small-business owners said the minimum wage should be increased, and 86 percent said the wage had no effect on them. \n \n \"The wage has been left at such a low level for so many years now that inflation has eroded it,'' says Scott Anderson, a senior economist at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co., the fifth-biggest U.S. bank. \"It's not as onerous to employers as it once was.'' \n \n Traditional View \n \n Edward Lazear, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, says President George W. Bush is willing to work with Congress on finding ways to boost the minimum wage that won't significantly harm businesses. \"He's not opposed to changing the minimum wage, but it has to be done in a sensible way,'' Lazear said in a July 24 interview. \n \n Other economists still argue that the traditional view is right. \n \n \"The law of demand says simply that the higher the price of anything, the lower the quantity that will be taken,'' says William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the Washington-based National Federation of Independent Business. \"This law has never been incorrect in predicting market behavior.'' \n \n Most evidence suggests \"that a minimum wage increase causes some job loss among low-skilled workers,'' says David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine. Neumark has written studies critical of research casting doubt on that view and has testified before Congress against minimum-wage increases. \n \n Changing Views \n \n This view once was widespread.

I'd be willing to bet that a cut in the pay of the top 10% by about 10% would easily fund a doubling of the minimum wage.

The problem is that if you go to an expensive restaurant, you will generally tip more for the same quality service than in a cheap restaurant. Now, waiters in both do the same job and deserve the same pay. You can't regulate for that sensibly but they should at least be able to count on earning enough to live on if they do their job properly.\n\n Actually, they really aren't doing the same level of work.
