   "http://www.pinpointevangelism.com/aboutus1.htm\n \n http://youtube.com/watch?v=PpekhawaMz8\n \n In this day and age, about 75% of Americans give their religion as Christianity.\n The other 25%? I think it's fairly safe to say we have heard about it. That we understand the fundamental ideas of Christ coming to save us from our sins, but for our own personal reasons we choose not to believe.\n \n With that said, why does the approach that is shown in the video above still exist?\n Specifically, people \"standing on the street corner\", yelling at people passing by, telling them how rotten their lives are.\n (Notice the sign: \"Do you love your sin enough to burn in hell forever?\" emoticon_rolleyes )\n \n I can't help but want to ask these people, \"Does it ever work?\"\n Such actions instigate confrontation. Not conversion.\n \n And if one realizes that such tactics do not work, then the question becomes \"Why do they do it?\"\n Does it satisfy some individuals' need for confrontation and instigation?\n Is it part of a need to foster a false sense of superiority?\n Is it financial in drumming up $$$ for their church?\n Or do they sincerely want \"conversion\", but just not realize their tactics turn people away from Christianity?",

   "It largely depends on whether you view the act of evangelising or the result of conversion as being the important one. If conversion is your aim then you will use appropriate means to your audience, if evangelism is your sole aim then shouting on a street corner will suit you down to the ground.\n \n It is rather like the debate between the role of government and charity. Christians on the left believe that the important thing is that help and healing is given to those who need it, and that because government can do this more effectively than charity, government should be used. Those on the right are more interested in what is given, hence the emphasis on tithing and individual action, rather than on actually changing the situation of people in need. Dom Helda Camara summed this up pretty well (see my sig).",

   "In my opinion, the only place it can work enough for anyone to possibly justify it for the sake of anyone being converted is in other cultures where people don't get turned off by it nearly as much, such as in many African countries and India. I think the cons far outweigh the pros of it in the U.S. and probably most any place in Europe. I think the main reason it still exists is simply because it's a carry-over from times past when it was more common. To be fair, there are 'street preachers' who aren't nearly as confrontational in their content as this guy.",

That's pretty much the definition of Evangelical. However, as is obviously the case, not everyone who calls themselves Evangelical feels that way. For many it's the spiritual equivalent of being the school yard bully. The same way a bully needs to beat kids up to feel tough and strong, the you tube guy needs to tell everyone how horrible their souls are so that he can feel better about his own. It's the classic \"make yourself feel bigger by telling others how small they are\" tactic. And of course religion makes a perfect outlet for this sort of behavior, since there is absolutely no way to show that the guy is wrong. He can claim salvation and call down damnation on others all day long, and there's no way to show that he's incorrect; his facade is perfectly safe.",

But, that's only if you're attacked.\n After that...\n And for every one who is defensive, there's another who's receptive.\n People have an odd tendency to connect things. Have a bad day, week, life and all of a sudden, something may just ring true in that preachers rhetoric.\n Gays are the root of your problem and gays spawn from Satan. If you join his glorious troupe of true believers, you're bound to be rewarded...or something...anything is better than your sucky life. And this preacher was put here by God just so YOU personally would hear the message...cause you're speeeccciiiaaallll!\n Everyone thinks they're special. Even secretly.\n Well, except those of us who strive to be background noise.\n We're the ones who really get away with murder. Because no one notices.\n But that's a different topic.\n \n \n Look, you don't have to worry about little old me...there's a multibillion dollar a year industry that works on exploiting human psychology.\n So much works on a subconscious level that it bypasses that initial knee-jerk reaction. \n \n Also, part of cultic programming is thought blocking. Preventing those thoughts from sinking into the subconscious where they can take root and lead to conflicting beliefs. \n Most people aren't part of a cult (or thoroughly indoctrinated into one...if they were, it's doubtful they'd be out in a place to even hear the street preacher) so, the preacher's 'seed' has as good a chance of laying dormant to take root later.\n Such as in a time of crisis...when you might actually think for a moment on what that 'crazy' person said...it could be true. \n \n And YES, people DO intentionally act obnoxious* if it suits their purposes.\n At times, I've been quite successful at it.\n \n *many who practice this don't call it that, however. They'd say it's the unvarnished truth.\n \n \n \n \n If you're really opposed to what they're doing...the best defense is to KNOW what they're doing and how effective it is.\n Just like a con.\n No one thinks that they're gullible enough to fall for a con...until they do. Then pride gets in the way more often than not.\n But, just like a con, there's a method to it. Some do it instinctively or are naturally adept at it.\n Look at politicians.\n 99.9% of EVERYTHING out of their mouths and exhibited in their body language is scripted. You think it's just speech writers they employ? \n Tonal infliction, enunciation, mannerisms and body gesticulations.\n Like dance and theater.\n \n The soap box preacher is employing a tried and true (existed for thousands of years) form of oratory.\n And if your initial reaction is defensive rather than dismissive...he's working.\n He's gotten you to respond.\n On an emotional level.\n Free from most thought.\n \n That = TEH WIN!1!\n Well, actually how can he loose?\n Look at us. We're wasting our time discussing him right now.\n \n If you wanted to seriously compete with him, you'd learn what he's doing. Know his material...better than he does.\n Then, you can go out, stand next to him with a louder voice and proclaim the \"BETTER NEWS!\"\n \n I mean, who wants the good news when you can have the Better News?",

They could be followers of either group or simply bystanders watching the show. The bystanders are there, quietly absorbing what's going on. They're the marks of both groups 'debating'. Much like the lurker is the real audience here when we all fight one another. My personal preference would be to the annoying preacher. Because he's just spewing for anyone to see and not targeting anyone specific initially in this instance. However, as pointed out, it's the students (I assume that's what they are) who are attacking him. Rightly or wrongly is a matter of opinion. But, he does have a right to free speech and freedom of religion. They also have a right to not have the peace disturbed. However, rather than seek legal redress, they try to shut him down with disjointed and ineffective attacks.\n It does appear a securiy guard shows in the end however.\n \n The only 'bullies' here are the hecklers.\n And the preacher doesn't run. Rather, he engages them (not super effectively but, he's not there to convert them...but the bystanders). \n If he somehow gets them, it's just icing on the cake. \n \n \nExcuse me for saying so, but that's just plain ridiculous.\n \"Mass consciousness level\"?\n If this were truly ANY sort of effective, you would see politicians out there screaming: \"Elect me or you're going to hell!\".\n The very real reaction that this \"preacher\" got was ridicule.\n\n \n Yes, politicians have similar approaches.\n No, they don't use threats of hell but they do use other scare tactics.\n A common (more than common, it's ALWAYS used) political ploy is to outline all the troubles and then say the solution is to simply elect them because they have 'plans'.\n Only in some limited circumstances will they outline those plans in anything approaching generalized detail.\n No, it's: \"Look, gas is at an all time high, the economy is in a recession, the Iraq war is dragging on without end, the sun is expanding, polar ice caps melting and the weather is causing food shortages...elect me and I'll fix it because I stand for change you can count on.\"\n \n What's the real difference from that and: \"Your family is broken, crime is rampant in this immoral society, there is no respect for traditional values, fringe groups have their desires come before your most basic needs, follow my god and all will be fixed with a miracle of faith.\"\n \n \nI think you miss the very real distinction between a street-corner preacher yelling at the top of his lungs, and a \"Truth\" commercial.\n The \"Truth\" commercial is covering a subject that EVERYBODY ACCEPTS a FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH on.

One sided and biased to get a desired result.\n \n I must also reverse the question.\n What exactly do the hecklers think they're accomplishing?\n In reality, they do as much damage to their cause as they help it.\n Ironically, pretty much what you think of the preacher.\n \n The Truth ads are effective because of how they work. They drone and drill away until you slowly conform to thinking what they say is absolutly true...pretty much what you've done here in your description on them.\n \n \nBy analogy, those people who REJECT Christianity aren't going to be persuaded, cause they don't believe it to be true at all. Not like people know that tobacco kills.\n\n \n Actually, converts grow on trees.\n And not everyone 'knows' that tobacco kills. For every commercial you can show where people die in droves from tobacco related deaths, one could be made showing people relaxing and enjoying their short, limited life through the use of a legal practice. Plenty of elderly people puffing away. That's what propaganda is. Just showing you one possible 'truth'. And one truth is that plenty of old people smoke away without ill effects. \n What the Truth ads are geared towards are young people who are ignorant of how marketing works and are easily pursueded by such shock tactics. Those who'd be likely to support the given cause...with money and votes. How many elderly people are \"Straight Edge\" and how many youth are?\n \n If you pay attention, most of those comemrcials do present a 'younger' crowd or a younger person impacted by the results of 'smoking'.\n This is intentional.\n Do you really think the target audience would care if a commercial showed 296 elderly people 'falling over dead each minute' due to cigarette smoking?\n Survey says NO!\n Oh, and yes, surveys are used to determine the impact of various permutations of commercialism.\n \n \n \nYou got the \"spewing\" part right.\n \n There are just sooo many levels at which this attempt in the youtube video is destined to fail that it isn't even funny.\n 1) Bullying results in a closed mind. Not persuasion.\n\n Initial raction is not a permanent reaction and as said, the bystanders (as witnessed in the video you posted) are the real audience. \n \n2) As you mentioned \"one on one (or even peer pressure...\", this guy is doing the OPPOSITE. He is going one on MANY. Encouraging a group mentality to REJECT his advances. Allowing people to lose themselves in the safety of the group, to reject the outsider.\n\n I've watched dozens of these videos in recent years on youtube. He was going one on 'anonymous'...not MANY as you think. It wasn't until he was directly attacked that it became him against 'many' (actually a handful of disjointed ill-organized kids who didn't know what they were talking about. Odd, he did have supporters there too (holding sign for example) who didn't jump in. \n \n3) He's losing the home court advantage. He is going, UNINVITED, to OTHER PEOPLE'S TURF, and invading with his preaching. If he were invited, it would be more conducive. If he were in his OWN environment, it would be more conducive.\n\n In many situations, you don't need to be invited. If he's a student at that University (which is a remote possiblity) or a tax payer (a definate possiblity) he's about as welcome there as any other group which wishes to spew. There is no 'home court' advantage. There's only comfort in numbers. And as mentioned, both sides have this. He has his fellow there as a silent supporter (sign holder) and the kids have each other thinking they're saying something of importance that can refute him. And they don't. The closest was the girl in the beginning...and it was clear her 'christianity' isn't supported by the bible...she appeared to not know it at all. Simply made stuff up and pushed it off as 'it's in the bible.' \n Furthermore, this is what biblical evangelism is actually about. Spreading the message to the non-believers.\n When I engaged that street evangelist a coulple of months back, I was capable of going toe to toe, passage for passage in the bible with him as well as using decent logic and better rhetoric than he to shut him down. And that was a case of being directly confronted. Not of someone spewing blindly to anyone.\n \n4) Suppose I'm a \"Widget\" person. I want to persuade you to be a \"Widget\" person.\n Would it make much sense to show you how much of an ### I can be to try to persuade you to be a \"Widget\" person?\n OTHER Christians look at this guy and think \"I don't want to be anything like him\". (And of course, Christian dogma is NOT responsible for his obnoxious behavior. IMO, he's violating a few bible verses.)\n How can we expect a non-Christian to be persuaded to become more like this obnoxious \"preacher\" guy?\n\n And here you're wrong. It's your opinion that this guy is obnoxious and you don't want to be like him. Just as it's mine that I'd rather see a mass grave with the rotting bodies of the 'college' students presented than to actually deal with them. See? Different conclusions based on the same material presented.\n Also, there are plenty of other 'Christians' who'd LOVE to have his conviction and ability to say what they believe in public. Lacking fear in being attacked by hecklers and rude children (which is what the college students are).\n \n And, why do I know that manhy Christians would love to be able to do this?\n Because I've sat with them in their churches and heard it with my own ears.\n Many lament that they aren't like the Mormons or Jehovahs Witnesses and able to spred their faith.\n And an FYI, the Mormons and JWs (and other sects) DO NOT send just anyone out. They TRAIN them. Recall back a few months about that church shooting in CO. (it's talked about in these forums). Well, the 1st shooting before the one at New Life in CO. was at a missionary training center.\n \n Now, if you want to back up your assertation with biblical verse to state this preacher was violating th bible, I'll take you on and cite scripture that shows he was doing EXACTLY what the bible calls for.\n I've done this before. \n I'm Zardoz! I like to use the bible. Got one on top of my computer ALL the time. ;)\n \n But, if you want to know how people will be pursuaded by this guy. This one in particular?\n For one, I was very much more offended by the rude punks that attacked him with their own brand of nonsense. \n The Buddist guy most likely doesn't know anything about that faith that he didn't hear 3rd hand. Basically, the message you'd hear from him is 'chill out, have fun and don't be mean to each other. Oh, and we call the golden rule Karma.'\n The man was able to keep going and deal with several people at once. He was unashamed of raising his voice to be heard and subjecting himself to the attacks of unbelievers.\n That takes some fortitude.\n \n \n \nAnd therein I question what is \"won\"?\n Do people really find \"emotion\" to be so easily transformed from one extreme to the other?\n From disgust or repugnance, to acceptance and respect?\n No.\n\n Emotion is often irrational.\n He's gotten you engaged. He's taken the lead and directs the discourse. He's tossed out several strawmen and beats upon them and isn't easily countered. He's fairly comported and didn't move from his spot. He doesn't invade anyone's personal space. His body language is mostly 'open', and engaging. \n And yes, emotions, if you have a decent guide, can be transmutted from one exteme to the other. It happens many times. \n \n \nWe are talking, but I don't see anybody changing their minds.\n And in THAT, he has lost.\n\n We've continued his campaign for him. You even re-posted the video for others to watch.\n What we're discussing is the tactics employed in this style. The medium used.\n Other people may digest the message over the medium and come to different conclusions. \n Even you and I have drastically different conclusions based on this video.\n I see a minor annoyance in the preacher. One I can fight and win on his own grounds using his own ammo...the bible. I find more annoyance in the dewds who are heckling them.\n Typical 'liberals' who are so full of themselves and their own superioirity that they are totally blind to their own ignorance and short comings. \n Hopefully maturity will set in.\n But, it's doubtful. \n \n \nTaking this a few steps further (okay, a few miles further), think about the whole \"terrorism\" thing.\n Terrorism's aim is to persuade the enemy to act a certain way by coercion.\n But it has the opposite reaction. It hardens the resolve of the opponent.\n\n Uhhh...\n TERRORISM WORKS!\n This is a foregone conclusion. This has been discussed on these forums countless times. The side that does not have the conviction to win looses in the end. \n How many terrorist groups have become legitimate organizations?\n How many times do we hear appeals to 'talk' to the terrorists to find a resolution?\n \n And, I'm Zardoz. For the sake simplicity, I was arrested in 2000 on a charge of 'terrorism' in the US. I was totally innocent of that.\n Also for the record, I fully support the use of terrorism to achieve ones ends. \n \n And for clarification, the hecklers were more engaged in an act of terrorism than the preacher was in this video. Their behavior was more immature and deplorable that his. They sought to silence someone they disagreed with. \n \n \n\"Emotion\" is not a friend of this preacher if the \"emotion\" is negative.\n Negative emotions don't just magically transform into \"positive\" ones, unless in extreme situations like \"Stockholme syndrome\".\n\n Just as in advertisement, there's no such thing as bad PR.\n Emotion takes you OUT of rational, intellectual thought and puts you into the irrational field this preacher lives in. He's disarmed his opponents...at a college campus (you know, place of THINKING) by doing this.\n In the end, the only response the budhist guy had was to litterally dance like a ####ing monkey and shout incoherantly.\n \n \n In a review of the video, I'd say Preacher man scored 19 (he lost points for 'pointing' and for using strawmen...but gained points for using strawmen effectively) to -5 for the dewds.\n \n The dewds don't know the bible despite making references to it. They asked direct questions that were answered by the pastor yet when asked in returned by the pastor a direct question, they were dumbfounded and had no rebuttal.\n The Mountaind Dew-tard buddist had to resort to 5 year old behavior and 'dance' in a mocking manner. I know who to go to to get weed when I'm on campus but...seriously, if that was a student...I'm left speechless.\n Oh, and the dewds also used strawmen in their own attacks.\n Ones that the preacher refuted (check out the comments on 'what is sin'.)\n \n *sigh*\n \n Any other questions?\n \n \n So, in conclusion, we get to see another thread displaying propaganda.\n You attack the boisterous preacher and in your blind bias over look the same sins of the hecklers.\n \n You asked a question in the OP on why such tactics are still employed and I answered as best as I could.\n Because they have been proven to work for centuries.\n They are taught, refined and are seen in many other cases.\n \n And, also, in the end, because the person using them believes that it is what he is supposed to do as outlined in the bible.\n That's the little book of myths that believers use as a guidelines for their beliefs and practices. \n \n The best form of rebuttal would have been to have had a majority of students approach him and ask him to Matthew 10:14 it right out of town.\n \"If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.\"",

   "1) In a review of the video, I do see the preacher as bombastic but the only bullies are the hecklers who can't just dismiss him as another crackpot but seek to shut him up as his beliefs contradict theirs.\n Furthermore, they don't even know the material being discussed (the bible and Christian theology).\n\n 1) First of all, I in no way *praise* the hecklers. They lose a LOT in style and content points.\n 2) The preacher is clearly trying to coerce people into following him with threats of hell. He meets the definition of \"bully\".\n \n \n \n2) If you watch the video, you'll note several people simply standing around. They could be followers of either group or simply bystanders watching the show. The bystanders are there, quietly absorbing what's going on. They're the marks of both groups 'debating'. Much like the lurker is the real audience here when we all fight one another.\n\n One of the reasons I posted this was to figure out if anybody is ever actually persuaded by these actions. The \"street preacher\" going onto a campus, and preaching about \"hell\" to try to \"convert\".\n And so far, I haven't seen anybody but you who thinks it can be effective. Which is entirely different from KNOWING it to have actually WORKED in some instance.\n \n This is part of an iceberg. There are NUMEROUS \"christian\" groups that go around to \"gay pride\" to proclaim how much god frowns upon or hates (or whatever terminology they want to use) gays or homosexuality.\n Quite frankly, I have been one of the \"several people simply standing around\" in those instance, and I would hope you wouldn't take that as meaning I have any real thought of believing their junk.\n \n You think those people standing around could be \"absorbing\"?\n I think they're observing a circus side-show.\n \n And on that, I will again try to repeat my question for the masses.\n Is ANYBODY EVER converted by these tactics?\n (And I would prefer to hear from somebody who WAS converted, and not somebody like Archie with dubious honesty...)\n \n \n \nHowever, as pointed out, it's the students (I assume that's what they are) who are attacking him. Rightly or wrongly is a matter of opinion. But, he does have a right to free speech and freedom of religion. They also have a right to not have the peace disturbed. However, rather than seek legal redress, they try to shut him down with disjointed and ineffective attacks.\n\n I'm a little shocked that you don't realize the students ALSO have a right to free speech.\n They have a right to protest.\n Responding to him IN KIND is not an infringement upon the preacher's rights.\n \n \n \nAnd the preacher doesn't run. Rather, he engages them (not super effectively but, he's not there to convert them...but the bystanders). \n If he somehow gets them, it's just icing on the cake.\n\n That last sentence baffles me, because I thought that was what we were discussing.\n HOW can the actual act of CONVERTING somebody be the \"icing on the cake\"?\n WHAT is the actual \"cake\" then?\n \n \n \nYes, politicians have similar approaches.\n No, they don't use threats of hell but they do use other scare tactics.\n A common (more than common, it's ALWAYS used) political ploy is to outline all the troubles and then say the solution is to simply elect them because they have 'plans'.\n Only in some limited circumstances will they outline those plans in anything approaching generalized detail.\n No, it's: \"Look, gas is at an all time high, the economy is in a recession, the Iraq war is dragging on without end, the sun is expanding, polar ice caps melting and the weather is causing food shortages...elect me and I'll fix it because I stand for change you can count on.\"\n What's the real difference from that and: \"Your family is broken, crime is rampant in this immoral society, there is no respect for traditional values, fringe groups have their desires come before your most basic needs, follow my god and all will be fixed with a miracle of faith.\"\n\n The real difference?\n A politician doesn't stand up and say \"YOU are broken\".\n Let me repeat that so it sinks in. The politician does not stand up and say \"YOU are broken\", cause that would automatically create a barrier for election.\n \n The politician is typically about blaming SOMEBODY ELSE. Liberals blame the conservatives and vice versa. Republicans blame the democrats and vice versa.\n Politicians do not stand up and try to blame the person they are trying to get to vote for them.\n For example, evangelicals have the highest divorce rate.\n But conservative politicians blame GAY MARRIAGE or GAYS for the problem instead. And the state WITH gay marriage has the LOWEST divorce rate.\n Do you think a politician would have much of a hope by blaming evangelicals for their own divorce rate problem? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n That's a HUGE difference, and why it would MAKE NO SENSE to go for the \"bombastic\" approach cause it comes off as confrontational, and arouses defense.\n \n \n \nPeople who don't care...\n Apathetic people who could go either way?\n So...you say using shock tactics is acceptable...when you think it is.\n\n < yawn <\n Did I say I wanted it illegal for the preacher to do what he was doing?\n No.\n \n So let's not create \"you say...\" scenarios regarding something that is not my position.\n What I AM saying is that the preacher's tactics are INEFFECTIVE.\n And I am explaining why TOBACCO's tactics have a GREATER CHANCE at being effective.\n \n \n \nActually, the Truth ads are just another form of propaganda.\n Most forms of communications involve a form of propaganda. One sided and biased to get a desired result.\n\n And I don't deny it's \"propaganda\" either.\n If you want to comment on my actual point, regarding why tobacco's propaganda has a greater chance at being effective than this street preacher, then please go back and do so.\n \n Taking it a step further, LOOK at how tobacco's propaganda plays out.\n Do the \"Truth ads\" ever say \"You're acting immorally for smoking\" or \"You're bad for smoking\"? NO.\n What they DO is SHIFT the focus of WHO is being bad to the TOBACCO EXECUTIVES. And they show the risks of what could happen to the person who is smoking.\n If the \"Truth ads\" came out and said \"Don't smoke cause it'll make you a bad person\", that would be less effective.\n \n \n \nI must also reverse the question.\n What exactly do the hecklers think they're accomplishing?\n In reality, they do as much damage to their cause as they help it.\n Ironically, pretty much what you think of the preacher.\n\n It's an excellent point to bring up the hecklers.\n I think they are blowing off steam. I see it as \"feeding a troll\" on a message board.\n I think they think they are \"refuting\" him, but it seems we can agree that their tactics (for the most part) are not effective at CONVERTING somebody.\n They are acting in a way that would be agreeable to people who THINK LIKE them, and the confrontational act \n \n \n \nThe Truth ads are effective because of how they work. They drone and drill away until you slowly conform to thinking what they say is absolutly true...pretty much what you've done here in your description on them.\n\n ROFLMAO! I can't remember the last time somebody performed such a well-executed zinger at me.\n \n But as for the reasoning for \"Truth ads are effective\", I disagree. I see them as having a hope at being effective because people KNOW that cigarettes make you sick. People typically have some knowledge of a history of cigarette companies battling the \"truth\" on cigarettes and health. And people typically already have some disregard for \"big companies\" that are callous towards consumers.\n It's relying on EXISTING emotions and knowledge. It shows people \"You know cigarettes make you sick, but do you know what a stoma looks like. Have you seen what cigarette smoking can do to your face (with wrinkles) over the years\"\n \n I can't help but think if \"drilling away until you slowly conform\" had a chance of working, then the Reagan's \"just say no\" would have had a chance.\n But the truth is that telling people JUST to do something is ineffective.\n You need PERSUASION to convert somebody.\n \n \n \nActually, converts grow on trees.\n And not everyone 'knows' that tobacco kills. For every commercial you can show where people die in droves from tobacco related deaths, one could be made showing people relaxing and enjoying their short, limited life through the use of a legal practice. Plenty of elderly people puffing away. That's what propaganda is. Just showing you one possible 'truth'. And one truth is that plenty of old people smoke away without ill effects.\n\n Good points on \"propaganda\".\n You're right that tobacco does not \"kill\" everyone. You're right that my hasty generalization ignores the fact that Uncle Frank started smoking at 16, then died with a cigarette in his hand when he got hit by a bus at 75.\n The accurate statement is that smoking increases the chances for cancer, yadda, yadda, yadda.\n \n \n \nWhat the Truth ads are geared towards are young people who are ignorant of how marketing works and are easily pursueded by such shock tactics.\n\n The same could be said regarding cigarette ads, before laws forced cigarette companies to stop targetting young people.\n \n \n \nInitial raction is not a permanent reaction and as said, the bystanders (as witnessed in the video you posted) are the real audience. \n I've watched dozens of these videos in recent years on youtube. He was going one on 'anonymous'...not MANY as you think. It wasn't until he was directly attacked that it became him against 'many' (actually a handful of disjointed ill-organized kids who didn't know what they were talking about. Odd, he did have supporters there too (holding sign for example) who didn't jump in.\n\n I suspect the \"supporters\" came with him. Not converts in the crowd.\n (Perhaps I shouldn't make that claim on the day I brought my \"You're going to burn in hell\" sign with me to work...)\n \n And actually, regarding the hecklers I think you bring up another point regarding \"intended\" vs \"actual\".\n One against many.\n A pretty significant \"propagandic\" perspective which can work to the preacher's advantage.\n Plus, the hecklers get more people to stop and watch as well. Drawing an audience, much like people looking at a car crash on the side of the road will cause others to want to stop and watch.\n \n But seriously. Referring to the \"hecklers\" as \"attacking\" is just plain propagandic, in its own right.\n They have a right to free speech and protest just like he does.\n \n \n \nIn many situations, you don't need to be invited.\n\n You miss the point.\n It isn't about the legal CAPABILITY to do what he's doing, but the PERCEPTION of him doing what he's doing.\n Being an outsider \"invading\" the territory, \"disturbing\" the peace.\n Definitely not illegal, but not pleasant imagery when it comes to providing \"openness\" for listening to the message.\n \n \n \nFurthermore, this is what biblical evangelism is actually about. Spreading the message to the non-believers.\n\n To put this a little more plainly, I see this as more \"invading\" somebody's territory than say a street-side preacher.\n Nobody owns the street either, but typically nobody considers a side-walk \"their\" area either.\n \n There was a story a while back about the \"Sisters of perpetual indulgence\" who went and sat in on a catholic mass in full \"garb\".\n I was annoyed.\n But they \"had a right\" to do what they did.\n Regardless of their \"right\", they acted in a way on somebody else's \"turf\" that was out of place.\n THAT is the effect I am talking about.\n \n \n \nAnd here you're wrong. It's your opinion that this guy is obnoxious and you don't want to be like him. Just as it's mine that I'd rather see a mass grave with the rotting bodies of the 'college' students presented than to actually deal with them. See? Different conclusions based on the same material presented.\n\n But part of the dichotomy here is that you bring this up as an \"either/or\" situation.\n If we could present that image, and ACTUALLY PREVENT the dead students, that would be one thing.\n \n But in this case, I don't think he's actually \"preventing\" anything. He hasn't persuaded anybody.\n \n \n \nAlso, there are plenty of other 'Christians' who'd LOVE to have his conviction and ability to say what they believe in public. Lacking fear in being attacked by hecklers and rude children (which is what the college students are).\n\n There is that word \"attacked\" again, for people who are exercising the same rights that he is using...\n And while some may wish to have his conviction, I think they may question his tact and effectiveness.\n Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.\n \n \n \nNow, if you want to back up your assertation with biblical verse to state this preacher was violating th bible, I'll take you on and cite scripture that shows he was doing EXACTLY what the bible calls for.\n\n Mat 10:14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. \n \n While Jesus did call for people to spread the word, he didn't tell them to be a pest about it.\n If your message isn't received, then LEAVE.\n \n \n \nBut, if you want to know how people will be pursuaded by this guy. This one in particular?\n For one, I was very much more offended by the rude punks that attacked him with their own brand of nonsense. \n The Buddist guy most likely doesn't know anything about that faith that he didn't hear 3rd hand. Basically, the message you'd hear from him is 'chill out, have fun and don't be mean to each other. Oh, and we call the golden rule Karma.'\n The man was able to keep going and deal with several people at once. He was unashamed of raising his voice to be heard and subjecting himself to the attacks of unbelievers.\n That takes some fortitude.\n\n You just went from \"persuaded\" to \"fortitude\".\n I don't believe there is an effective correlation, especially when one doesn't believe the person's position in the first place.\n By that standard, shouldn't Fred Phelps have his church just growing by leaps and bounds?\n \n \n \nEmotion is often irrational.\n\n True, but it's still a barrier for persuasion if there is a negative emotion created.\n People don't typically say \"Oh wait. I've got an *irrational* emotion, so I should disregard it in trying to evaluate this blow-hard's message\".\n \n \n \nHe's gotten you engaged. He's taken the lead and directs the discourse. He's tossed out several strawmen and beats upon them and isn't easily countered. He's fairly comported and didn't move from his spot. He doesn't invade anyone's personal space. His body language is mostly 'open', and engaging. \n And yes, emotions, if you have a decent guide, can be transmutted from one exteme to the other. It happens many times.\n\n There is a huge difference between \"it happens\", and \"it will happen when you go onto a college campus and start yelling at kids that they're going to hell\".\n I have no doubt \"it happens many times\".\n \n My point is that for THIS time, when THIS guy is being so confrontational, it's not going to happen.\n \n \n \nWe've continued his campaign for him. You even re-posted the video for others to watch.\n What we're discussing is the tactics employed in this style. The medium used.\n Other people may digest the message over the medium and come to different conclusions. \n Even you and I have drastically different conclusions based on this video.\n I see a minor annoyance in the preacher. One I can fight and win on his own grounds using his own ammo...the bible. I find more annoyance in the dewds who are heckling them.\n Typical 'liberals' who are so full of themselves and their own superioirity that they are totally blind to their own ignorance and short comings. \n Hopefully maturity will set in.\n But, it's doubtful. \n\n < yawn <\n A preacher goes uninvited to a college campus to disturb its relative peace and quiet by yelling at the students telling them they are going to hell (with signs for proof).\n And it's the hecklers who are \"so full of themselves and their own superiority\"...\n \n It's an issue of \"look at the neighbor's yard so mine doesn't look as bad\"...\n \n \n \nUhhh...\n TERRORISM WORKS!\n This is a foregone conclusion. This has been discussed on these forums countless times. The side that does not have the conviction to win looses in the end. \n\n HOW does it work?\n Does it work by PERSUADING the opponent to change their mind?\n NO.\n THAT is the issue at hand, so please don't lose sight of it.\n \n What you describe as \"terrorism works\" is the same way that \"war works\".\n \n \n \nHow many terrorist groups have become legitimate organizations?\n How many times do we hear appeals to 'talk' to the terrorists to find a resolution?\n\n If we're going to go this route, I would prefer these not be \"rhetorical\" questions and you actually give examples.\n Cause quite frankly, al Qaeda would be an excellent example of how some say we should \"talk\", but most of our \"talk\" is heard through explosions.\n \n \n \nAnd, I'm Zardoz. For the sake simplicity, I was arrested in 2000 on a charge of 'terrorism' in the US. I was totally innocent of that.\n Also for the record, I fully support the use of terrorism to achieve ones ends. \n\n Well, I haven't heard anything so ridiculously and grossly repugnant and vile on these boards in a while.\n So you support killing innocents in order to achieve a \"political\" point?\n \n Quite frankly, you just did a lot to decimate any credibility towards your position, IMO.\n \n \n \nAnd for clarification, the hecklers were more engaged in an act of terrorism than the preacher was in this video. Their behavior was more immature and deplorable that his. They sought to silence someone they disagreed with.\n\n How can you \"silence\" somebody by TALKING to him?\n \n And furthermore, your classification of \"terrorism\" makes me wonder if you know what it means.\n terrorism: violent or destructive acts (as bombing) committed by groups in order to intimidate a population or government into granting their demands \n \n They were not being \"violent\" or \"destructive\".\n You are becoming increasingly propagandic in categorizing their actions, in order to side-step the conversation of the preacher's lack of effectiveness.\n \n \n \nJust as in advertisement, there's no such thing as bad PR.\n\n That statement is usually made by people who want you to pay them for how they are going to deal with that situation...\n And the statement usually goes \"bad PUBLICITY\".\n PR means \"public relations\".\n If you seriously don't think there is no such thing as bad public relations, then may I ask if you work for George Bush?\n \n \n \nEmotion takes you OUT of rational, intellectual thought and puts you into the irrational field this preacher lives in. He's disarmed his opponents...at a college campus (you know, place of THINKING) by doing this.\n In the end, the only response the budhist guy had was to litterally dance like a ####ing monkey and shout incoherantly.\n\n So?\n If a rather intelligent person came out and passionately talked about how blacks should be slaved, and he was only countered by a nitwit who could only \"dance like a monkey\", the monkey still wins ...\n The person endorsing slavery would not convince anybody just because a \"monkey\" was there.\n \n You keep trying to change the subject to the hecklers, like they somehow make the preacher more believable.\n \n \n \nIn a review of the video, I'd say Preacher man scored 19 (he lost points for 'pointing' and for using strawmen...but gained points for using strawmen effectively) to -5 for the dewds.\n\n See the above.\n Just because somebody may think the preacher \"performed\" better doesn't make his ACTUAL MESSAGE one that is accepted by default.\n \n \n \nSo, in conclusion, we get to see another thread displaying propaganda.\n You attack the boisterous preacher and in your blind bias over look the same sins of the hecklers.\n\n Speaking of \"propaganda\"...\n \"attack\"????\n I started out this thread by simply asking if people saw his actions as effective in converting.\n And if not, then what is his REAL point in doing what he does.\n \n And now you label my position as an \"attack\"?\n \n \n \nYou asked a question in the OP on why such tactics are still employed and I answered as best as I could.\n Because they have been proven to work for centuries.\n They are taught, refined and are seen in many other cases.\n\n And again I say FALSE.\n You keep giving counter-examples that have significant and CRUCIAL differences which demonstrate why the one is destined to fail, and the other will succeed.\n \n With tobacco, it is not a criticism OF THE SMOKER, while the preacher IS performing criticism of his audience.\n With tobacco, there is an underlying truth at work that is ALREADY ACCEPTED. Perhaps painted in a \"propagandic\" manner involving a \"you will die\" mentality instead of the actual fact of \"you have a XXX% increased chance for cancer, ....\", but it's involving an ALREADY ACCEPTED truth nonetheless.\n For somebody who does NOT believe in Christianity, this preacher is doomed to fail.\n \n \n \nAnd, also, in the end, because the person using them believes that it is what he is supposed to do as outlined in the bible.\n That's the little book of myths that believers use as a guidelines for their beliefs and practices. \n\n I've had people walk up to my door and ask me if I wanted to talk to them about Jesus.\n I respectfully say \"No\", and they ACCEPT that answer and don't bother me.\n THAT is the type of behavior that is outlined in the bible.\n \n By your vague interpretation, if a Christian ran up on stage during the democratic convention and grabbed the microphone and started preaching (or just started preaching on the convention floor), that would be \"outlined in the bible\". And the people who booed would be \"hecklers\" who were \"silencing\" him, who should get \"negative points\" because they aren't more articulate.\n And the \"Christian\" would win by your point system to boot...\n \n \n \nThe best form of rebuttal would have been to have had a majority of students approach him and ask him to Matthew 10:14 it right out of town.\n \"If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.\"\n\n What a coincidence.\n My thoughts exactly.",
