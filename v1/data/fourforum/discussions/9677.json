   "What gives God the right to boss us around? Is it simply because of his power and intelligence? If we were as powerful as him, would he still have a claim over us?\n\n Yep. The ultimate example of Might Makes Right.\n \n \nI find it somewhat unfair that God completely determines our fate, that he can do anything with even a thought.\n\n Life ain't fair, I don't think there's and real statement in the Christian Bible stating or implying fairness. A form of Justice and Mercy but no fairness.\n \n \nWhat gives him the right to do something like that? Simply because he created us? Because he has superior intelligence? What if I wish to revoke God's claim over me? How would I do that, and how would I also protect myself from the devil when I have seceeded from God's power?\n\n Rights don't exist. It's a made up concept. Power and ability and compromise is all that's there. So, yeah. Once again Might Makes Right and if you don't want to believe so...to bad.\n \n \nGod sounds a bit like a bully to me. He tells us what to do and what not to do, and we don't have any say in it.

If someone is super powerful and intelligent, does that mean he/she can do whatever he/she wishes to anyone less intelligent? I'm a bit confused here.\n\n Pretty cool huh? All you need to do to act in godliness is be chaotic. Pick on some for no good reason and reward others for equally no good reason. \n \n Personally, I'd say this 'God' is nothing more than a typical delusion cooked up in the subconsious part of the mind of collective humanity where the homosexual masochistic part lives. The part who wants an abusive older man to spank their bums while they say in return 'I love you too.'\n Of course, most hide this nature by being homophobic and cruel to one another.\n \n *shrug*\n \n I just made all that up, but, it does sound plausible and can be used to get out of a speeding ticket. ;)",

Why should they leave the religions they follow in ood faith and have 'experiences' with to follow yours? You have hypocracy in your House. I've seen more idols/ graven images in a Christian building than in a Mosque for example.\n \n Furthermore, I'd contend that as in the movie Dogma, mere seperation from God could be a form of hell. Yet, multitudes of humanity haven't experienced this God as you believe to have done. How can a just God punish those who really never 'knew' him and were only told about Him?\n \n This is akin to an absentee father who might be sending a support check to some children and not to others, coming into their lives when they are grown men and stating, \"Yo, I'm yer daddy, I have the power to read your mind, do you love me? If you do sincearly, I'll give you a BMW, if not I'll shoot you in the head!\" \n \n I also know from human psychology that 'experiences' can be counterfeited on a fairly consistent basis. Self delusion is one manifestation. How could an intelligent person who knows this and has witnessed it not come to a conclussion and blindly trust the teachings of others who more often than not are little better than your back alley drug addict in their line of thinking?\n \n So, while I don't doubt your personal experiences, I do doubt their origins at the moment. If you are trying to convert me and I see a plank in your eye due to human weakness why would I even dream of following your god?\n After all, if He produces dysfunctional misfits who are destructive from a point of view and really doesn't seem like a nice guy, why want to be one too? Just so I can cozy up with him for all eternity. Can I just choose oblivion, a life without end seems tedious.\n \n \n *this is generalizations (You meaning Christianity), I really don't have a grasp on you personally.",

Should I 'worship' them as I would a god?\n \n I was watching an episode of Stargate last night that dealt with this same question, worshiping something that's merely stronger or more powerful than you. It basically stated that strength is no justification or worthiness to worship.\n \n \n I guess I'm not off in my adoration of the All Mighty Dollar. I've seen far more miracles performed by it through the motivating grace of greed and desire than I have anything else. I'ts reliable more often than not and can provide my hearts desires and needs. All I need do is focus on it, respect it, love it. It doesn't even claim to desire this. But, then again, it can be humble when it wants to be. It's found nearly everywhere. It's even focused on excessively and against the commandments of other religions when tithing is pushed and offerings demanded. Their buildings are built with it, their pockets lined and their holy books printed all due ot the Almighty Dollar through which nothing would exist. \n It goes by many names in many different tongues. Dollar, Peso, Franc, Mark, Yen, Euro...\n It is THE Universal god of man.\n If you don't believe so, try living without it.",

   "This right here is the crux of the mass delusion within the natural man, that each individual can legitimately have their own personal truth, and that they actually possess an actual TRUTH. That is the false premise that sends most of humanity to eternal separation from the living God and Creator. Only He is actual TRUTH in this life, any other belief system is false and based in a lie. But heathens and pagans have been worshiping statues since the begining which does confirm our innate need to respond to our God, but also to our foolishness to think we can form our own god out of raw materials like wood, stone, or metal.\n\n \n The concept of this kind of God does not make sense to me. This God has given us over 100 different religions, and he says you have to randomly choose the correct one or you're going to hell. There is no more or less evidence supporting one religion over another. Its just random choice, and if you get it wrong you go to hell. And then he plants all of this false evidence to contradict almost every single religion out there. So, which one do you believe? He has offered no proof or evidence to favor the so called \"real\" religion, he just lets you play a guessing game, and if you guess wrong, you are eternally punished.

Is it simply because of his power and intelligence? If we were as powerful as him, would he still have a claim over us?\n \n I find it somewhat unfair that God completely determines our fate, that he can do anything with even a thought. What gives him the right to do something like that? Simply because he created us? Because he has superior intelligence? What if I wish to revoke God's claim over me? How would I do that, and how would I also protect myself from the devil when I have seceeded from God's power?\n \n God sounds a bit like a bully to me. He tells us what to do and what not to do, and we don't have any say in it. We are sentient beings, we should have rights. Simply because he/she created us, does that give them ultimate claims over us. If someone is super powerful and intelligent, does that mean he/she can do whatever he/she wishes to anyone less intelligent? I'm a bit confused here.\n \n Nowhere is the existence of God questioned in this post. The question was, is this God worth worship. How can you argue whether God is or is not a bully without acknowedging his existence? There are no leaps to make when the argument is presented as it was. Were the argument more akin to the four step process ye posit, I would be more in agreement with ye. But then, matters of faith and matters of logic do not move in the same circles.
