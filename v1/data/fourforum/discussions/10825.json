I really don't like animosity and don't deal with hate and bitterness in my daily life. And I realized I was responding in kind to these debaters who use corrupt tactics and insults with anyone who opposes their arguments.\n\n \n If that was true, you would have had no problem stopping those behaviors. \n One who claims that they want to foster healing and an good atmosphere would examine their faults and contributions to the problem and stop them. The first step to fixing an personal flaw is accepting that you have the personal flaw. Attacking others for telling you your personal flaws when you are trying to stop those does not help your promise. \n \n \nAnd you can clearly see the response I got on this very thread from these same posters to my attempt at putting the animosity behind us. To say I'm frustrated would be an understatement. But I still agree with your perspective and will attempt to make peace with who ever is willing to treat me with respect and change the negative energy that is created by these same posters.\n\n \n A fair amount of my posts to you are now largely about fact checking. I cited several examples of where you could have avoided problem by simply plugging them into Google and seeing if they were valid. And I am trying to do it in a polite fashion. \n \n I'm TRYING to give you advice to lower the amount of flak you are taking.",

Stop making accusations that he can't back up. Stop making claims for which there is no evidence. Stop running away from tough questions. Pay attention to the information that is given to him. Stop using fallacious arguments.\n \n But Archie has specifically said that he has no interest in responding to our points. All he wants to do is post his opinion and ignore anything that is said, whether it's mere dissent or bona fide counter evidence. He views anything contrary to his interpretation of the world as a personal attack.\n \n For this behavior, I have no qualms about ripping him a new one for each and every instance of this hypocritical nonsense. Unfortunately, I can't possibly keep up, so I have to make my posts count.",

   "It seems as if I have caused quite a lot of turmoil with my post. That was not my intent. The point of my post is that we all play to an audience in a debate and to be accurate, reasonable, logical, passionate while being polite, and to (at the appropriate times) be humble is what the audience will notice. This doesn't mean you have cower in the corner when attacked, call them on it. I've found that when attacked if I point out the attack, and remind the attacker that I have treated them politely and treated their point of view with respect, and that I expect the same from them. Point out that name-calling doesn't advance their point of view or argument. Try to reason with them politely. I have noticed that over the past 40 to 50 years that the American public has become quite disrespectful and rude. All it takes is a look at our congress to see it. They act like a bunch of spoiled brats banging their spoons on their high chairs. We are a civilized society lets try to act like one.\n\n \n As a commissioned demogogue in the service of the Anti-christ, I must say you're incorrect.\n History has proven that impassioned rhetoric, complete with personal attacks, is great for motivating sympathetic listeners to action. Respect for one's enemies is a sign of weakness and never ending attacks on them can often spurn them onto brash and ill-thought behavior.\n Getting your opponent to sling mud too goes to illustrate that they are, indeed, no better than you and it also justifies your own actions. Like for like.\n In the end, all will be the same and the dark lord of the underworld wins by default. *rah* Moral corruption. The prefered form of diabolical recruitment.\n \n As to your observations on Congress...ever witness the political systems of other countries?\n At least there are no fiticuffs on the floor over competing ideologies.\n A shame really.\n Something really must be done...",
