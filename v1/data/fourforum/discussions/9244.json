The link was posted in the original post. \n \n Do you dismiss all interpretations of the Bible? Or is your interpretation the only correct one? IMO the common interpretation is nothing more than a convenient tool to spew hatred towards gays.\n\n \n Well, no, no one dismisses all interpretations of the Bible. Even those that think it's all a hoax are still using an interpretation. I'd say anyone with an interpretation is going to think their's is the correct one, wouldn't you? \n \n I disagree that the common interpretation is just a tool to spew hate--because most people with that interpretation don't spew hate at all. There are a very few very high profile people that do, and because of that it tends to give people in your movement an excuse to paint all Christians who have that interpretation the same way as those few people.",

   "Alrighty ... then let's use your phraseology. emoticon_xgood What IS the scientific BASIS for giving food and shelter to the homeless?\n\n If we must use your silly example, science tells us that feeding people allows them to meet vital nutritional needs, which is beneficial for their well being. Helping people is the moral goal, science and reason allow us to say if we're succeeding or not. \n \n \n Because you and Themoose sure seem to think religion is a bad basis for morality.\n\n Well, at least we got that much through to you. :)\n \n \n\n No, Kronos, that's why YOU think I would. And really, I think you're probably smart enough to know that the religious stance does not equate to prejudice, but rather to Biblical interpretation, so the chain yanking you're doing is pretty transparent.\n\n A religious stance, in and of itself might not, but in this case it clearly does. When asked why you follow one part of Leviticus and not another, you claim that one part is a moral law and the other isn't. When asked how you knew the difference you waffled. The answer is clear; you wanted to consider some parts to be moral to justify thoughts you already had, and you wanted the other parts to not be moral so that you could ignore them. Which is exactly why pretending that a religious stance equals a moral stance doesn't work.\n \n \n\n Now please, let's not get into another one of your accusational spats here. The admin doesn't like it, and frankly it's counterproductive. \n\n The admins can speak for themselves, I think. \n \n \n\n Who's standard is THE standard then? Where is the committee who sets the rules??\n\n Ah yes, the committee. The straw man you always grasp at this point in this discussion. So for the Nth time, here we go.\n \n The \"rules\" developed over time, based on what worked. The basic tenet of morality, help people don't hurt them, is apparently necessary if people are going to survive in groups of any size larger than an extended family. Groups that didn't adopt this morality didn't survive, those that refined it successfully flourished. \n \n And how about you try answering my question instead of bouncing another back? If people can define morality however they want, then does that not make the term meaningless?\n \n \n\n It's strange that on one hand you argue against the idea of religion's view of morality that there is an over-arching universal standard, but then in the same post you seem to hold to an idea (non-subjective morality) that would require there to be an over-arching universal standard.\n\n Not strange at all if you ever paid attention to what was being said to you. I've tried to explain this to you multiple times. Of the various moral codes that man tried through the ages, one worked better than the rest, and that one survived. \n \n \n\n Is it just the idea that morality might actually have theistic basis that bothers you so, rather than some persons', as a standard?\n\n In one sense yes, but in another that's almost backwards. The problem with theistic morality is that we have no way of confirming what God thinks. So any theistic morality inevitably becomes one person's interpretation. You yourself said that you have gone through Leviticus and decided, with no basis that you can explain, that some of it is moral law and some isn't. I want a real moral standard, not just what one person thinks.",

Just because somebody declares a \"moral\" view on an issue does not mean that the human rights aspect stops existing.\n \n \"Morally\" most religions declare other religions to be wrong.\n But from a \"human rights\" perspective, we acknowledge that different religions have a right to exist, and that discrimination on the basis of religion is wrong.\n \n \n \nHaving that moral view doesn't mean hate for gays; it just means the view the issue differently. That's the reason many people who believe that gay actions are wrong are not racist or prejudiced; and it's the reason numerous high profile black people and some associated with civil rights have come out against the gay pride movement at times. The attempt to associate the issue of homosexual actions with human rights is really a gay pride movement strategy that has worked in some cases, and hasn't in others.\n\n The reason people come out against civil rights for gays is because they are opposed to gays.\n \n And Jyoshu, considering our discussions you should know better. We've talked endlessly about \"actions\" vs \"being gay\".\n How many \"civil rights\" have discrimination against gays because they commit gay sex?\n The PREDOMINANT form of civil rights discrimination is against people JUST for BEING GAY.\n \n When people say they are against the gay \"action\", but then discriminate against gays REGARDLESS of any knowledge as to whether or not the gays have actually \"acted\" upon their attraction, is a clear sign that the issue is BEING gay and not ACTING gay.\n \n The part in the article where they talk about gays being \"chaste\" would fit the BEING gay.\n Demanding they be silent on the issue is a demonstration of the church's prejudice against people BEING gay.",

We all agree that moral and good are closely related terms; being moral is a good thing. But if you can call anything you like moral that goes out the door.

The facts of the matter are that they were hurting people, and therefore acting immorally, and this can easily be shown via logic and reason. Face it, people can reframe anything, there's nothing that's immune to that. But if one uses science and reason than it's much harder to reframe things. Logic can't be reframed away, bogus reasoning is much easier to expose than bogus theology. I can wave my hands and call all sorts of actions \"helpful\" if I couch them in terms of religion or emotion or something of that sort. But if I can back up my assertions with reason than you can follow them and understand why I think I'm being helpful, or point out where I'm wrong. If you want your moral code to be solid and not subject to reframing than it must rely on reason and logic. Use science to tell if something is helpful or harmful, use reasoning to see if that conclusion is being used correctly. You're proposal has people reframing things from the get go, by changing the very defintion of moral as they see fit.

When we are discussing the religious issue, we are talking about a spiritual issue. There is no qualitative difference between a person who has been called by God to abstain from heterosexual sex and one called to abstain from homosexual sex.

Are you understanding what I'm saying?\n \n \n...the sacrifice of a gay person, with regard to their sexual orientation, is greater than the sacrifice of a straight person, with regard to their sexual orientation.\n\n \n How on earth do you get the idea that it's a \"greater sacrifice\" for a gay person than a straight person? THEY BOTH have to be celibate in that situation. If anything, it might even be harder for the straight person because there are far more reminders of hetero intimacy in the world around them, reminding them of what they don't have.\n \n \nYou're missing the point.\n They CAN be separate, but saying that a thing is a \"moral issue\" does not preclude the possibility of a simultaneous human rights issue.\n Just because somebody says \"morality\" doesn't mean an issue isn't a human rights issue.\n\n \n Yeah, so? It sounds like you're drawing a distinction between the two. I don't see how this pertains to what we're talking about.\n \n \nYou can't invoke the statements of others who don't think GAY rights issues aren't civil rights issues, and then hide back behind your \"own\" position that you aren't against \"being\" gay. You can't have it both ways. Either stick to people who ONLY desire legislation against gay ACTIONS, or acknowledge that the people who you are trying to 'quote' for an opinion actually have an opinion that contradicts your own...\n\n \n I DON'T have it both ways--I'm talking about gay actions.

Apparently I was wrong. You keep trying to bring society' rules for getting along into this as if THAT'S the universal standard of morality, and I've demonstrated already that it's not because morality sometimes goes above and beyond that, or falls short. A reading of Matthew chapters 5 and 6 gives a number of examples of how society's rules may indeed help people get along, but they don't suffice for morality in any compassionate sense. I guess you CAN let your morality be limited to society's rules for getting along if that's what you want to do, but it's certainly not where I want to stop. So to that end, sure, society's rules CAN be someone's morality, Kronos. Feel better? \n \n \nLike I said, you keep trying to generalize the situation to ignore the fact that gays are having to sacrifice more under that dogma than straights. Can you just admit that?\n\n \n From a spiritual standpoint, that's not what matters--remember, many gays just want to obey God. If God tells them to not have sex, not drive a car, not eat pork, whatever ... then that's what they do. The fact that you find God to be discriminatory frankly doesn't alter the spiritual situation any whatsoever.\n \n \nThere is a quantitative difference between ALL gay people being \"called to abstain\", and relatively few who are \"called to abstain\". And what do you classify as \"called to abstain\"? Possibly priests who have the luxury of CHOOSING whether or not they want to be priests? As opposed to gays who have NO choice as to whether or not they want to express their sexual orientation?\n\n \n No, see, you have a fundamental musunderstanding of God's calling and the Christian life, here. If God calls a straight person to abstinence, they have no more choice to disobey than a gay person would when God calls them to do that. BOTH are sin, from God's perspective, if they disobey. You say that the priest has a luxury to just say no and not be a priest, but that's not true. He'd be in disobedience if he does that.\n \n Now re. your 1st point, you're just complaining about numbers--that it happens that all gay people have to abstain and not all straight people. That doesn't matter from a spiritual standpoint; if that's what God wants, that's what He wants. Now YOU many not believe that, but many gays DO and prefer to put their religion over their sexuality.\n \n \nOkay. Now that we have established that simply saying \"X is a moral issue\" does not preclude \"X\" from ALSO being a civil rights issue...\n Can you NOW explain why X=Gay issues are not \"civil rights\" issues.\n\n \n They may be. I'm not arguing that they aren't. But for MANY of them, it's a spiritual and religious issue, and THAT'S what I'm talking about. That's where this is morality being played out rather than just a 'civil rights' issue. Remember--we're talking about statements by the Catholic church on living, not on laws. \n \n \nOh. Silly me. They just want to tell gays to REMAIN SILENT so that policy on the gay issues cannot be questioned... Telling them to not ADMIT that they are gay obviously means that the policy has to be questioned... It's amazing how you keep trying to pretend that acknowledging the existence of gays is an issue of \"propaganda\" and \"controversy\" on the part of gays. Yet over and over again, it's the anti-gay crowd who are the ones insisting that we remain silent in ways that they NEVER place on themselves.\n\n \n I didn't say I completely agreed with Catholics in this. I'm not even Catholic. I'm just telling you why they've said what they've said regarding the silence issue. I think a better approach would probably be to note that some people are indeed inclined toward same-sex relations ('being gay'), and not require the silence aspect so much. Obedience to God can still be emphasized without requiring them to be silent about the matter. But you have to realize that the Vatican isn't stupid; they saw what happened in the Anglican community and the damage that was caused there, and they don't want that. \n \n You also need to remember that the RCC sometimes tends to sway too far in reaction to things, and I think this is simply another case of the RCC doing that. They're responded to the mere possibility of people causing an uproar and propaganda by expecting complete silence from gay Catholics. That's an overkill reaction, consistent with the way the RCC has responded to many things throughout history.",

We don't, the range is very small. \n\n \n But there IS a range. And it seems to change a LOT from person to person from what I see. One person is against any war at all. Another is all for it. That's a HUGE difference involving the killing of thousands of people, not just some minor range difference. One person is against the death penalty, the other is all for it. A tribe in South Africa interbreeds, with no marriage standards, and is constantly at war with other tribes. Groups in Utah would be perfectly happy with one man to 10 wives. One person sleeps around with 2 or 3 partners a week, another has been with only one very loved person his or her whole life and married for decades. The range goes on and on ...\n \n \nThere is a common thread that runs through any moral code worthy of the name.\n\n \n Wait a minute ... are you now saying there can be more than one moral standard?

If you can do that than I'll conceed that you have a point. You can't ask for fairer than that.\n\n \n Well, I'd say that a moral code certainly doesn't HAVE to have compassion, but it's better to. It can just \"get along with people\" instead. It seems to me that ANY one who follows the basic rules of society to get along (but doesn't go the extra steps of compassion) would be using morality without compassion. See my last paragraph below for how the two are different. And I'm starting to think part of the problem here is that you are viewing \"moral\" in the sense of only being benevolent, and I'm viewing it more in a broader sense--that morals can be bad OR good.\n \n \nAs I said, I don't see that it is changing. The basic morality hasn't changed, only how evenly it's been applied. Show me otherwise if you have an example.\n\n \n I don't see how you can say that! Do you not think there has been progress over the centuries? We no longer conquer and colonize Africa as Western nations--we send them aid and funding (though we should be doing a lot more!). While the death penalty once involved torture and prolonged beheading, we now put people to sleep with drugs. (and many countries are doing away with the death penalty.) The Aztecs used human sacrifice regularly--nobody does that anymore. And we now strive, as a world, to make sure there won't be another Nazi genocide repeat. These are all examples of morality being something that changes (not static)--because peoples' morality changes. It's really nothing more than more and more people happening to hold to personal moral views that happen to be like others as well.\n \n \nSociety's rules are based on compassion. You simply push harder than the average person. Same underlying morality, you just expect greater compliance.\n\n \n No, they are not based on compassion. If they were they wouldn't stop at things like not killing each other, or not stealing. Those are based on the need to get along. Compassion would be taking the 'not-stealing' standard and thinking \"wow, that thief may be stealing because he's hard up for money and food--I think I'll just GIVE him what he's trying to steal as well and double it while I'm at it.\" See what I'm saying? Incidentally, this is the reason that far more Christian charities exist than secular ones: it's that people in some religions tend to base their morality on something loftier than simply getting along. That's not to pat Christians on the back, but simply to demonstrate a real world example of what I'm talking about.",

   "But there IS a range. And it seems to change a LOT from person to person from what I see.\n\n Before we go on I've got to drive home this point. Not everyone lives up to the moral standards. Doing the right thing often calls for sacrifice, a sacrifice that not everyone is willing to make. So just because someone is saying they hold such-and-such a position, and just becuase the issue is a moral one, doesn't mean that they are actually basing their decision on their morals. They could very easily be rationalizing to justify a decision based on something utterly divorced from morality. So simply pointing out that two people hold different positions doesn't demonstrate that they hold two different moral codes. \n \n \n\n Wait a minute ... are you now saying there can be more than one moral standard? More than one code?\n\n I am saying that there is one underlying basis for morality, but that people can go to different degrees as to how far they allow morality to run their lives.\n \n \n\n that morals can be bad OR good.\n\n Ok, you've totally slipped out of the realm of defintions of morality that I'm familiar with. I thought I had some idea what you meant by moral before, but now I have no clue at all. Are you still going to refuse to give anything like a defintion? Or must a wander in the dark here?\n \n \n\n I don't see how you can say that! Do you not think there has been progress over the centuries? \n\n I think the huge bulk of moral progress in the last couple of millenium has been in people's willingness to extend moral behavior to a wider group. People used to only apply moral behavior to their family/clan. Then to their village, then to their countrymen or religious bretheren. But they allowed themselves to think of people outside that group as not being worthy of moral consideration. You don't murder your mother, you don't rape your sister, but the \"other\" is beneath contempt, and therefore you're not subject to moral considerations when dealing with them, kill and rape all you want. The other could be a neighboring state, a different race, gays, whoever. But progress has been in realizing that everyone is deserving of being treated morally, not in the changing of what is meant by moral.\n \n \n\n These are all examples of morality being something that changes (not static)--because peoples' morality changes.\n\n No, as I say above those are all examples of morality being applied more equitably.\n \n \n\n It's really nothing more than more and more people happening to hold to personal moral views that happen to be like others as well.\n\n Um, that's exactly what I said before, when explaining why we now have a common moral basis. There's one moral basis that actually works, compassion, and so it's the one that's been adopted. Compassion didn't just \"happen\" to be popular, it's the one we use because it works. \n \n Note, I'm using the standard defintion of compassion here, not the WWJD defintion.\n compassion: sympathetic consciousness of others' distress together with a desire to alleviate it, from merriam webster\n \n \n\n No, they are not based on compassion. If they were they wouldn't stop at things like not killing each other, or not stealing. Those are based on the need to get along. Compassion would be taking the 'not-stealing' standard and thinking \"wow, that thief may be stealing because he's hard up for money and food--I think I'll just GIVE him what he's trying to steal as well and double it while I'm at it.\" See what I'm saying? \n\n I see two things. First, that what you call compassion is a much stronger term than the standard defintion. You're talking about taking compassion as far as you possibly can. But more importantly, I see that you aren't disagreeing with my point, you simply aren't understanding it. The rules of society do in fact say that giving a thief all the food and money he wants would be a wonderfully compassionate, and therefore moral, thing to do. We just don't assume that everyone is going to be sufficiently morally advnaced to pull that sort of behavior off all the time.\n \n \n\n Incidentally, this is the reason that far more Christian charities exist than secular ones: it's that people in some religions tend to base their morality on something loftier than simply getting along. That's not to pat Christians on the back, but simply to demonstrate a real world example of what I'm talking about.\n\n I don't think so. People who dedicate themselves to religion are dedicating themselves to a moral lifestyle, or at least many are (obviously there are exceptions). The morality they're dedicating themselves to is the same as everyone elses, they're just commited to putting more effort into it.",

   "God also calls many heterosexuals to abstain 100% as well.\n\n Since you've shown an interest in quoting statistics (100%...)\n \n Under your dogma, 100% of gays are asked to abstain 100% of the time.\n Rough estimate, what percentage of straights are asked to abstain 100% of the time? Would 0.1% be a close estimate? Less than that?\n \n Are we talking just priests for the specific sects that believe priests need to be celibate?\n \n \n \nActually the number is probably not so far apart as you may think, because there are not anywhere near as many homosexuals as there are heterosexuals.\n\n Well, we can examine that as soon as you give the above number.\n \n Although I have to pause and note what you just did there, which I find hilarious. You want to compare STRICT numbers, as in number of people to number of people, exploiting the fact that there are more heterosexuals than homosexuals.\n \n A more even-handed approach would compare per capita percentages. But it shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody that you didn't choose that... emoticon_xangel \n \n \n \nFrom a spiritual standpoint, that's not what matters--remember, many gays just want to obey God. If God tells them to not have sex, not drive a car, not eat pork, whatever ... then that's what they do. The fact that you find God to be discriminatory frankly doesn't alter the spiritual situation any whatsoever.\n\n You keep wanting to talk about the \"spiritual standpoint\" so you can ignore the fact that we're talking about asking something of 100% of all the gays, as compared to what I expect will be less than 0.1% of all the straights.\n \n \n \nNo, see, you have a fundamental musunderstanding of God's calling and the Christian life, here. If God calls a straight person to abstinence, they have no more choice to disobey than a gay person would when God calls them to do that. BOTH are sin, from God's perspective, if they disobey.\n\n Fine.\n Can you point out to me then the people that are \"sinning\" by refusing to answer God's call? And precisely HOW a person knows they are \"called\" by God? Is it similar to a schizophrenic hearing voices?\n \n And can you also point out to me the bible passages which establish they are \"sinning\" by not answering God's call?\n \n \n \nNow re. your 1st point, you're just complaining about numbers--that it happens that all gay people have to abstain and not all straight people. That doesn't matter from a spiritual standpoint; if that's what God wants, that's what He wants. Now YOU many not believe that, but many gays DO and prefer to put their religion over their sexuality.\n\n Amazing how irrelevant that is to you, but obviously relevant to others.\n \n But, even from a \"spiritual\" stand-point, the point is that the BURDEN IS NOT THE SAME. What is asked of the average homosexual IS NOT the same as what is asked of the typical heterosexual.\n \n comedian Lynn Lavner observed: \"The Bible contains six admonitions concerning homosexuality and 362 admonitions concerning heterosexuality. I do not mean to imply by this that God hates heterosexuals, only that they seem to require a great deal more supervision.\"\n \n \n \nThey may be. I'm not arguing that they aren't. But for MANY of them, it's a spiritual and religious issue, and THAT'S what I'm talking about. That's where this is morality being played out rather than just a 'civil rights' issue. Remember--we're talking about statements by the Catholic church on living, not on laws. \n\n You have just shifted COMPLETELY away from your original statement regarding the perspective of some that gay issues are not civil rights issues.\n I guess I'll have to take that for what it's worth...\n \n And before you even try to obfuscate what you said earlier, let me remind you...\n \"That's the reason many people who believe that gay actions are wrong are not racist or prejudiced; and it's the reason numerous high profile black people and some associated with civil rights have come out against the gay pride movement at times. The attempt to associate the issue of homosexual actions with human rights is really a gay pride movement strategy that has worked in some cases, and hasn't in others.\"\n \n \n \nI didn't say I completely agreed with Catholics in this. I'm not even Catholic. I'm just telling you why they've said what they've said regarding the silence issue.\n\n It's funny how you admit you are not a Catholic, but then you pretend to speak for the Catholics.\n I'm just curious. Are Catholics stupid? \n Is that why they ACTUALLY said that gay Christians should be completely in the closet, but what they ACTUALLY MEANT to say was just that they shouldn't cause a \"ruckus\" in the church instead?\n \n \n \nI think a better approach would probably be to note that some people are indeed inclined toward same-sex relations ('being gay'), and not require the silence aspect so much. Obedience to God can still be emphasized without requiring them to be silent about the matter. But you have to realize that the Vatican isn't stupid; they saw what happened in the Anglican community and the damage that was caused there, and they don't want that. \n \n Yeah. I guess while this country may have been \"founded\" on Christian ideals, with the listed ideals being democracy, freedom of speech and expression, and freedom to lobby for change in the government, these obviously aren't \"Christian\" issues that are espoused...\n \n \n \nYou also need to remember that the RCC sometimes tends to sway too far in reaction to things, and I think this is simply another case of the RCC doing that. They're responded to the mere possibility of people causing an uproar and propaganda by expecting complete silence from gay Catholics. That's an overkill reaction, consistent with the way the RCC has responded to many things throughout history.\n\n Funny how the RCC shows such a greater intolerance for gays than they do pedophiles in their clergy...\n But of course, this all CAN'T POSSIBLY point to any possible \"prejudice\" towards gays. Of course not. In \"religion\", that's just unthinkable...\n < end sarcasm <",

How's that?\n \n \nSure, but they don't pretend it's moral [to murder family members].\n\n \n But they don't act as though it's immoral, either. The point is that there are people of which their morals allow for them to do that. Again, I'm not talking about morality only in the sense of good things.

It seems you believe most everything as compassionate to some degree, and that it's all just a matter of degree. I view compassion as going above and beyond what would be expected of someone just to get along with others. And I suspect that if you ask most people if holding a kid in your house until the cops arrive, they wouldn't associate \"compassion\" with that to any degree. Perhaps even the next item on your scale as well. But they wouldn't associate them with being harsh either.\n \n \nIn Les Mis, where the thief steals the bread and the priest gives him the sliver as well, and everyone considers it to be a fine, noble act. Just because people don't live up to their ideals doesn't mean they don't exist.\n\n \n In what form do these universal nobler ideas exist in society, then? In the back of peoples' minds knowing there's a nobler way to live? In their subconsciousness? Are you suggesting people actually think these nobler things before they act and then don't do them? Because if they do THAT, then it's even worse you see--they don't have the excuse of ignorance. But if they don't think of the nobler ideals at all, and react to situations by only thinking of the non-noble ways to respond, then I don't see how you can really argue that these nobler ideas really do exist with everyone. I think they exist with SOME people, and not with others. Some people are inclined to react more compassionately than others, and as such morality is a very individualitic thing. It varies from person to person. :) \n \n \nSure, that's how most people react. If people instinctivly acted in a manner that we call moral we wouldn't have needed to develop a moral code, or have societal pressure to enforce it. \n\n \n But not everyone calls the same things 'moral.'

It doesn't. These are two very different issues. Many people who believe gay behavior should not be relegated to the 'normal' are very much against racism--in fact there are some IN the civil rights movement that have made statements in the past asserting that the gay pride movement shouldn't be identifying itself with it. Even one of ML King's own family members have pointed this out. (They know it's often a morality issue, not a prejudice one.) Sure, it may make you feel more empowered about your movement to associate it with civil rights, but that doesn't make it valid.

The point is that there are people of which their morals allow for them to do that. \n\n I'm really confused here. Do you really think that eveyone always does what they think is right? No one ever has a guilty conscience or feels bad about something they've done? Or understands that there's a way they're supposed to act, but they just don't care? Or lets greed, hate, anger, or lust cloud their better judgement? You realize that people like that make up 99.9% of the world, don't you? No one is morally perfect. \n \n \n\n In what form do these universal nobler ideas exist in society, then? In the back of peoples' minds knowing there's a nobler way to live? In their subconsciousness? \n\n To a greater of lesser degree, yes. We are exposed throughout our lives to stories of nobel and ignoble deeds, and are taught that we should emulate the noble. It's rarely spelled out that such-and-such is specifically moral, and this-other is immoral, although that does happen on occasion. Mostly it's something we're exposed to, and then hopefully the lesson is reinforced throughout life. Obviously some people pick it up better than others.\n \n \n\n Are you suggesting people actually think these nobler things before they act and then don't do them? Because if they do THAT, then it's even worse you see--they don't have the excuse of ignorance. \n\n Like I said, morals need to be learned. Some do better than others, and I suppose it's possible that some never have the chance to learn them at all, if their situation is bad enough. I'm not sure why you think knowing what the right thing to do is and failing is worse than thinking that evil actions are moral, but unless it's crucial to your argument I don't see any reason to pursue that.\n \n \n\n But if they don't think of the nobler ideals at all, and react to situations by only thinking of the non-noble ways to respond, then I don't see how you can really argue that these nobler ideas really do exist with everyone.\n\n Just to clarify. There's one basis for morality. I'm not saying that everyone applies it or learns it equally.\n \n \n\n But not everyone calls the same things 'moral.' Or they call different things moral. That's the problem with your argument.\n\n Let's take an example. Is the death penalty moral? We have two sides that have different answers. You're claiming this means different morals, but that isn't the case. You have to look at the arguments. The NO side says that killing is wrong. Compassion, clearly. The YES side says it removes a danger to society and brings peace to the victims families. Again, that's compassion, but compassion towards the families and society in general. The arguments both start at the same point, they just apply the principle of compassion in different ways. If you think about it I think you'll find that all moral debates boil down to that problem. In what way should the principle of compassion best be applied? It's not always a trivial question, and I think the fact that the answer isn't always obvious has led you to think that there are a multitude of viable moral codes out there.",

   "If that's the case, then we have utter moral relativism, yes? The term \"moral\" has no relationship to anything like good or evil.\n\n \n I think among people, moral relativism certainly IS a reality. People are both good and bad and one person may view one act as morally bad that another views as morally good, and vice-versa.\n \n \nDo you see that \"personality\" and \"universal personality\" are entirely different things? You can define personality, \"the complex of characteristics that distinguishes an individual\", without saying that everyone has the same personality.\n\n \n But you're the one who, of the same logic were applied, would be arguing for a 'universal personality.' By your very view of morality, it's universal. Your logic doesn't seem to account for individualism at all, other than degree of some universal standard.\n \n \nReally pushing that individualist aspect, aren't ya? :)\n Ok, if that's what you consider morals, than what good is the term? You're pushing moral relativism here, where anyone is justified to call anything good or evil. And it also means that people will have things they call morals that are based on prejudice, hate, fear, greed, you name it. This definition utterly divorces \"moral\" from any common defintion of \"good\".\n\n \n Like I said, I realized in the last couple of posts you were viewing the term \"moral\" only in the context of benevolency rather than in the broader sense. I think a better phrase to use for the perspective you're coming from is \"morally good\" rather than just \"moral\". To some degree we've been arguing from two definitions. I'm talking about morals in the sense that one's morals can be good OR bad. And no, I'm not talking about relativism--I'm talking about the simple fact that some people have bad morals. This is simply reality.\n \n \nI'm really confused here. Do you really think that eveyone always does what they think is right? No one ever has a guilty conscience or feels bad about something they've done? Or understands that there's a way they're supposed to act, but they just don't care? Or lets greed, hate, anger, or lust cloud their better judgement? You realize that people like that make up 99.9% of the world, don't you? No one is morally perfect.\n\n \n In terms of rule-for-getting-along-in-society? Sure. Most people know better than to kill someone, because society frowns on that. But regarding morals, I think you give people in general here way too much credit here. Most people, I think, never even consider going the extra mile, or forgiving the thief that just robbed their home. \n \n \nLike I said, morals need to be learned. Some do better than others, and I suppose it's possible that some never have the chance to learn them at all, if their situation is bad enough. \n\n \n I would simply say that's their morals, and most of society doesn't hold to them.\n \n \nLet's take an example. Is the death penalty moral? We have two sides that have different answers. You're claiming this means different morals, but that isn't the case. You have to look at the arguments. The NO side says that killing is wrong. Compassion, clearly. The YES side says it removes a danger to society and brings peace to the victims families. Again, that's compassion, but compassion towards the families and society in general.\n\n \n Ok, that's fair enough--I can see your point regarding this example. But what's most interesting with your thinking here is that any side of most any ideology (no matter how insipid) could be construed as morally good. To me, THAT'S moral relativism. \n \n At the same time I think this example only shows that either side could conceivably try to claim a morally-good high-ground; it doesn't disprove the idea that there can be both good or bad morals with people. That a person's morality can be bad. Someone, for instance, could care neither for the death row inmate NOR for the victims' family, and just as soon they all be dead (a general disdain for society and people in general, perhaps).",

It isn't about people having different opinions. It means that there is no moral standard, that any position can justifiably be called moral. \"Justifiably\" is key here. This isn't just people saying that it's moral, but being wrong. This is about anyone being able to call anything they like moral, and being just as correct as the next person. Is that or is that not what you're advancing here?\n \n \n\n But you're the one who, of the same logic were applied, would be arguing for a 'universal personality.' \n \n Yes, but the point is you weren't! It shouldn't have taken me five posts to drag a defintion out of you.\n \n \nYour logic doesn't seem to account for individualism at all, other than degree of some universal standard.\n \n Exactly!

I think a better phrase to use for the perspective you're coming from is \"morally good\" rather than just \"moral\".\n \n There is more that one way to be good, but if you're acting morally than you're acting good. That's part of the standard usage. Moral behavior is good, and immoral behavior is bad. That's the way the term is used.\n \n \nI'm talking about morals in the sense that one's morals can be good OR bad.\n\n Which goes against common usage.\n \n \n\n In terms of rule-for-getting-along-in-society?\n\n Ok, that's your term, not mine.

Most people, I think, never even consider going the extra mile, or forgiving the thief that just robbed their home. \n\n So what? I've said multiple times that not everyone has learned morals as well as others, and that you're talking about a very high level of moral behavior. You're not contradicting, or addressing, my point.\n \n \n\n Ok, that's fair enough--I can see your point regarding this example. But what's most interesting with your thinking here is that ANY side of most any ideology could be construed as morally good. To me, THAT'S moral relativism. \n\n No, don't put words in my mouth. I never said or implied that any side of most any ideology could be construed as morally good, just either side of a real moral debate. My entire point here is that if you start at a common point, and stick to reasonable thinking, then you can't call anything you want moral or immoral. Not all answers will be easy to reach, but you can come to many definite conclusions.\n \n \n it doesn't disprove the idea that there can be both good or bad morals with people. \n\n Ok, because you're using your own defintions here I have no idea what you're trying to say.

Not \"bad morals\". If I'm following you, and I by no means assume I am, you seem to be thinking that rapists have sat down and come up with a system of thought whereby rape is a good thing to do. He would call those good morals, and you, opposing him, would call them bad morals. Is that right? If it is than I would ask you to drop that usage, because I think you're the only person in the world to use it, and it's confusing. The rapist does not think that raping is good; he knows it's bad, he simply doesn't care, or at least not enough to stop. The rapist is immoral if he knows what he's doing is wrong, or if his mind is broken to the point where he doesn't know right from wrong then he's amoral. That's the common uasge.",

It means that there is no moral standard, that any position can justifiably be called moral. \"Justifiably\" is key here. \n\n \n \"Justifiably\" is too much in the eye of the beholder. Realistically, any position can justifiably be called moral depending on what justification is used. You're back to the idea of some universal standard (this time of 'justification') that really isn't set in any official or standard way. Your view seems to be very black and white, and there's just too much gray area in the world, in society, an with various issues.\n \n \nExactly!

Ok, because you're using your own defintions here I have no idea what you're trying to say. What are \"bad morals\"? Spell it out, because that's an oxymoron from the dicitionary's point of view.\n\n \n Not so: from dictionary.com: 'morals' is defined as \"principles or habits with respect to right or wrong conduct.\" So it depends on how the terms are used. The dictionary includes 'morals' as a noun and as such it can be either. As far as I'm concerned, the adjective \"immoral\" is just another way of getting across the idea of \"bad morals\" so feel free to use the adjective \"immoral\" if you prefer. (\"Immoral\" cannot be a noun--e.g. \"immorals\"--but \"moral\" CAN be the noun use--e.g. \"morals\"; and when used as a noun certainly does not denote ONLY benevolent values. It can denote either benevolent OR malevolent (as I just pointed out). If you use 'moral' only as an adjective, then yes, I suppose it denotes benevolent things. Do you understand what I'm saying here? Someone's morals can be either good OR bad.\n \n \nSo what? I've said multiple times that not everyone has learned morals as well as others, and that you're talking about a very high level of moral behavior. You're not contradicting, or addressing, my point.\n\n \n I would entirely agree that not everyone has learned to be morally good. It just seems to me that your thinking doesn't allow for the idea of a malevolent belief system. Look, yours is your model to go by, and that's fine. I'm not criticizing it. We're sort of just arguing two ways of saying the same thing here, as I mentioned earlier. \n \n \nYeah, that's called ammoral, or possibly evil. Not \"bad morals\". \n\n \n It certainly can be \"bad morals.\" This has gotten down to adjective versus noun use, and as such there's no point in continuing. Again, I say we're arguing two ways of getting the same idea across.\n \n \nIf I'm following you, and I by no means assume I am, you seem to be thinking that rapists have sat down and come up with a system of thought whereby rape is a good thing to do.\n\n \n YES!

Now that may be a temporary way of thinking for them and so they may feel sorry afterwards, but they've decided to do it.\n \n \nHe would call those good morals\n \n \n Probably not in most cases--though I'd say that's not impossible.

   "\"Justifiably\" is too much in the eye of the beholder.\n\n No, it's not. By your definition anyone can call anything moral. Your defintion is the justificiation. If your defintion holds than anyone is allowed to call anything moral and no one can say they are wrong. They can say \"I don't think it's moral\" but they can't say \"it isn't moral\".

Any morals that dump something in the good bin that you would put in the bad? Or are you trying to say that actions that are morally bad are bad morals? Confusing the action with the classification system used on the action, as it were.\n \n \n \n I would entirely agree that not everyone has learned to be morally good.

There might be rapists that have justified it in their minds, it feels good to them, and it seems right to them to assert power over someone else. \n\n I'll buy the \"it feels good to them\" part, although that has nothing to do with morals. But if you're going to claim that rapists think it's right to rape people you're going to have to back it up with some real evidence, because that's an absurd claim. They know it's wrong, but they do it anyway.\n \n \n \n Now that may be a temporary way of thinking for them and so they may feel sorry afterwards, but they've decided to do it. \n\n You seem to have a real problem with this concept.

Becuase your whole argument seems to be based on the premise that people only do what they think is moral, and that's just not even remotely true.

But there are other examples from history where people did things that they definitely called moral that I would say were not. The Nazis killing the Jews.\n\n Justification of the holocaust had nothing to do with morals, and everything to do with politics, fearmongering, and insanity. Can you show me anything said by the Nazis that even vaugley resembles a moral argument for genocide?\n \n \n \n Some have argued that slave owners felt they were moral in what they were doing.\n\n Sure, by saying that blacks were sub-human, and that making slaves out of them was a civilizing, not to mention evanglelical, process. Which is to say, they were basing their moral arguments on compassion. If they had applied science and reason as well they would have noticed that their premise about the sub-humanity of blacks was incorrect, however. Their moral foundation was the same as ours, they just didn't apply it evenly.

All you can point to is that some people are sometimes compassionate. Or you've attempted to indicate that compassion is a scale of some sort, even including actions with no benevolent or non-benevolent value as examples of being on the 'compassion scale'. Your logic has been that compassion can be defined so broadly that it is merely lack of malevolency. You've claimed compassion is the basis for universal morality, then basically defined compassion as something that be pretty much non-substantive and merely doing no harm alone. I don't view compassion that way, and I don't think that's common understanding of it either. I think most people view compassion as going above and beyond doing nothing, in most cases.\n \n \nMay I just point out that that is probably the worst dictionary on line?

Only \"fit\" moral systems survived, and those were benevolent ones.\n\n \n Wow! That's just flat out not the case in so many instances. In fact, more often than not down through history, the very opposite occured. For instance, it was certainly no evolution of good morals (or just 'morals' as you put it) that led to a situation today where many native American tribes have largely been eradicated here due to European greed. And if only the good societies survived, how is it that malevolency is still a problem in the world? (not just a small problem mind you, but a huge problem--more war-related deaths have occured in the last 100 years than in any century preceding it.) If anything, the western society has \"evolved\" to it's present place and time through malevolency and war, rather than being good.\n \n \nAnd as I explained, we're not. The critical point that I'm trying to get across is that your idea that anyone can call anything they like moral simply doesn't work. I'm not talking about a system, I'm talking about the system.\n\n \n I'll say it again--there is no \"the system\" in terms of peoples' morals.\n \n \nI'll buy the \"it feels good to them\" part, although that has nothing to do with morals. But if you're going to claim that rapists think it's right to rape people you're going to have to back it up with some real evidence, because that's an absurd claim. They know it's wrong, but they do it anyway.\n\n \n So you think anytime someone does something immoral, they always know it's wrong? I already said I can agree that applies for societal rules. But I think you give people, particularly the sorts that rape others, way too much credit in terms of always having a conscience about what they're doing.\n \n \nYou seem to have a real problem with this concept. People do things they know are wrong. Do you trully not get that?\n \n \n I get what you're saying of course, but I don't agree. No, they know society doesn't want them to do it, and that it's against the law. There's a difference, and that's what I've been trying to tell you. (you say that has nothing to do with what you are saying but it has to do what what I'M saying. Because I chalk up what you're saying as society's rules for getting along.) I already agreed that they may do things they know goes against soceital rules. Twice now. But do you really think every rapist feels sorry for his actions? Do you really think every rapist thinks, while he's carrying out his heinous act \"oh, I really shouldn't be doing this. It's wrong.\" No. His morals might be such that he doesn't do that. he may, in fact NEVER feel sorry for his actions and believe there is not a darn thing wrong with it. \n \n I wish you were right, and that everyone in the world agreed on what was right and wrong and knew what to do. That there really was a Universal Morality\u0099. It would be a lot better world. But it's not that way.\n \n Let's break this down, to see where we are.\n I say that morals vary from person to person, and that not everyone holds to the same morals. I also say that morals can be bad or good.You say (if I understand you correctly) that there is some universal morality, and that somehow everyone knows what it is, or is on the process of discovering what it is. You view morals as only being good.\n That's our core disagreement. Period. We can carry on if you want, but I think we should lleave it there and say that we disagree on the means, but that we agree on the ends--that everyone should try to be good and compassionate; whether that involves changing their morals from bad to good, or adopting the universal morals--whichever way one wants to say it.\n \n What say ye?\n \n \nJustification of the holocaust had nothing to do with morals, and everything to do with politics, fearmongering, and insanity.\n\n \n Oh come now. Are you saying that you think not a single Nazi ever though ridding the world of Jews was the right thing to do? Did you know that Mein Kamph was basically \"the very Bible of every Nazi\" even prior to Hitler's rise to power? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf)\n \n \nSure, by saying that blacks were sub-human, and that making slaves out of them was a civilizing, not to mention evanglelical, process. Which is to say, they were basing their moral arguments on compassion. If they had applied science and reason as well they would have noticed that their premise about the sub-humanity of blacks was incorrect, however. Their moral foundation was the same as ours, they just didn't apply it evenly. \n\n \n Their moral foundation the same as ours, and they were basing their moral arguments on compassion??? No. I'm sorry, but I think you are giving them way too much the benefit of the doubt here. They were basing their moral arguments on the fact they wanted someone to plow their cotton for them.\n \n \nThe proof of this is simple; if they trully thought slavery was fully moral then they wouldn't have objected to whites being slaves either, right? But of course they would have. So it's not their morals that were different, it's how they thought of blacks.\n\n \n It seems to me that this only proves that their view was not tied to the more compassionate idea of equality. You can just as easily explain it by saying they viewed blacks malevolently and wanted whites to not have to work.",

Where'd you pull that one from?\n \n \n You've claimed compassion is the basis for universal morality, then basically defined compassion as something that be pretty much non-substantive and merely doing no harm alone.\n \n I think you decided ahead of time that you didn't like my argument, and then read what you wanted to read. This has nothing to do with what I've said. See above about why I'm not presenting proofs yet.\n \n \n \n \n I'd say a bad belief system is bad morals. Tendency to do bad is bad morals. Tendency to do good is good morals. It's not that complicated, really. It's really just another way of saying a lot of what you're saying.\n \n If it's not complicated than describing it shouldn't be this hard. First off, you say that bad and good can be made up as you go along, so whose \"bad\" are you talking about here. If I think an action is good and you think it's bad, is that bad morals for you but not for me? Or is it only bad morals if the person doing the action thinks it's bad? If I think an action is bad and you agree, and I do it anyway, is that bad morals? The problem here is that you think all these terms have no fixed meaning from one person to the next, so if they're all relative you have to be extra careful about what point of view you're speaking from.\n \n \n \n Wow! That's just flat out not the case in so many instances. In fact, more often than not down through history, the very opposite occured. For instance, it was certainly no evolution of good morals (or just 'morals' as you put it) that led to a situation today where many native American tribes have largely been eradicated here due to European greed.\n \n But we don't do that anymore now, do we? Viola!\n \n \n \n And if only the good societies survived,\n \n Please try to pay attention. Not good societies, benevolent moral principles.\n \n \n \n how is it that malevolency is still a problem in the world? \n \n Because morals are contrary to human nature. People have no instinct to be benevolent to anyone outside their family group, that's why we needed to develop morals. As long as human nature is essentially selfish there will always be malevolency.\n \n \n \n I'll say it again--there is no \"the system\" in terms of peoples' morals.\n \n\n And that's exactly the point I'm trying to drive home here. You say there isn't, I say there is. We are NOT saying the same thing, as you've now twice claimed. That's what I'm trying to get across here.\n \n \n \n So you think anytime someone does something immoral, they always know it's wrong?\n\n There are people with mental disorders which prevent them from telling right from wrong, and those who simply were never taught. But by and large yes, when people do something immoral they know that it's wrong. That's why they feel bad about it, or rationalize their actions, if their moral sense is developed enough to care at all.\n \n \n \n I already said I can agree that applies for societal rules. But I think you give people, particularly the sorts that rape others, way too much credit in terms of always having a conscience about what they're doing.\n\n Then show me anything to back that up. Show me anything that might lead me to believe that a rapist thinks that raping is moral. \n \n \n \n (you say that has nothing to do with what you are saying but it has to do what what I'M saying. Because I chalk up what you're saying as society's rules for getting along.) .\n\n Read that back to yourself. I'm telling you that your interpretation is wrong, but your going to keep using it anyway because that what you've chalked it up to. I've seen how you're using the phrase and I'm telling you that your interpretation of that phrase and what I mean by morals are not the same thing.\n \n \n \n But do you really think every rapist feels sorry for his actions? Do you really think every rapist thinks, while he's carrying out his heinous act \"oh, I really shouldn't be doing this. It's wrong.\" No. His morals might be such that he doesn't do that. he may, in fact NEVER feel sorry for his actions and believe there is not a darn thing wrong with it. \n\n Then what you're describing is some who hasn't developed any morals to the point where they effect him. Just as I know that the ancient Hebrews would think that poly-cotton shirts were taboo but I don't care, the rapist knows that he shouldn't rape but doesn't care. He knows what's considered right, but simply has so little moral devolpment that he doesn't let this knowledge effect him. What he does not do is develop some code whereby raping is considered good. That's really giving the rapist too much credit, to think that they would put in the mental effort to develop a code of conduct to justify his acts. He doesn't care about justificiation, he's just acting on what he wants.\n \n \n \n I wish you were right, and that everyone in the world agreed on what was right and wrong and knew what to do. \n\n I really wish you would pay more attention. First off, the points of disagreement on what is right and wrong are few and far between; people are vastly in agreement about what is moral. And I've already explained, several times, how you can start at a common point and reach different conclusions in a few situations. Try to look at it the other way. If you were right, and everyone could call whatever they liked moral, then why do we have so much agreement about right and wrong, even across cultrural and religious lines? Why don't we have 6 billion distinct moral codes, most of which are incompatible with the rest?\n \n \n I say that morals vary from person to person, and that not everyone holds to the same morals. I also say that morals can be bad or good.You say (if I understand you correctly) that there is some universal morality, and that somehow everyone knows what it is, or is on the process of discovering what it is. You view morals as only being good.\n That's our core disagreement. Period. We can carry on if you want, but I think we should lleave it there and say that we disagree on the means, but that we agree on the ends--that everyone should try to be good and compassionate; \n\n \n First a correction. A moral action is a good action. That's the adjective form. Morals, the noun, are a system of determing good and bad and, in and of themselves, are neither good nor bad. The principles our moral code are based on are good. That may be what you meant, but \"morals are good\" is simply way too oversimplified to let stand.\n \n That aside, I'm not sensing alot of progress, so if you want to call it quits then fine. However, you must admit that based on your defintions saying that someone is acting on their morals is an almost meaningless statement. \"morals\" conveys nothing specific to you, and can't even be associated with good. If we can at least settle that it'll save time in the future.\n \n \n \n Their moral foundation the same as ours, and they were basing their moral arguments on compassion??? No. I'm sorry, but I think you are giving them way too much the benefit of the doubt here. They were basing their moral arguments on the fact they wanted someone to plow their cotton for them.\n\n You were the one saying that some had moral arguments. OI course most of them just wanted cheap labor, and weren't using morals to justify it at all.",

   "So you are, in fact, arguing for moral relativism, where the term moral has no consistent meaning.\n\n \n Like I said, I think moral relativism is a very real thing. It happens all the time. I not arguing I think that moral relativism is the way to go, but I'm glad we're in agreement that it's there.\n \n \nOf course I haven't proven it yet. You don't even understand what I'm trying to say yet, and I certianly don't understand everything you're saying. We are no where near the point of developing enough common ground for you to follow any sort of proof I would lay out.\n\n \n Yes, Kronos, I do understand your position; doesn't mean I have to agree. I don't. I don't believe there is a universal morality among all human beings.\n \n \n? Where'd you pull that one from?\n \n I think you decided ahead of time that you didn't like my argument, and then read what you wanted to read. This has nothing to do with what I've said. See above about why I'm not presenting proofs yet.\n\n \n You argued that compassion was more of a scale, giving such examples as calling the cops on an intruder as an act of compassion. That's so non-substantive in terms of compassion, it's basically exemplifying compassion simply on the basis of 'doing no wrong.' I think most people think of compassion differently than that.\n \n \nIf it's not complicated than describing it shouldn't be this hard. First off, you say that bad and good can be made up as you go along, so whose \"bad\" are you talking about here. \n\n \n No, please try to pay attention. I didn't say they could be made up as they go along. I'm saying moral values vary from one person to the next, and they do.\n \n \nIf I think an action is good and you think it's bad, is that bad morals for you but not for me? Or is it only bad morals if the person doing the action thinks it's bad? If I think an action is bad and you agree, and I do it anyway, is that bad morals? The problem here is that you think all these terms have no fixed meaning from one person to the next, so if they're all relative you have to be extra careful about what point of view you're speaking from.\n\n \n Who decides the 'fixed meaning?' It's not like there's a committee. (Yeah, I know, you hate me using that term.) Even if you try to chalk universal morality up to society and it's standards, when it's all boiled down society is still made up of individuals. Perhaps the best way to describe our difference here is the following:\n My position: morality starts at the individual level, and influences society's universal values;Your position: think morality starts at the society universal level, and influences individuals' values. (correct me if I'm wrong)\n I think it's possible it could be both. Can you agree with that? Can we find common ground that it could go both ways?\n \n \nBut we don't do that anymore now, do we? Viola!\n\n \n Well let's see, the world's one remaining superpower just invaded a middle easter country, currently occupies it, and has killed a lot of people. Yes, still happens. Doesn't sound like social moral evolution to me. Maybe social immoral evolution. emoticon_frazzled \n \n \n \nBecause morals are contrary to human nature. People have no instinct to be benevolent to anyone outside their family group, that's why we needed to develop morals. As long as human nature is essentially selfish there will always be malevolency.\n\n \n But earlier you responded positively to the idea the good principles existed in the minds of people, in their subconsciousness. Is this not human nature? Or do you think the good morals are only learned, and that people are, by default, bad? I also think it's interesting that you are essentially saying that malevolency is an individual trait here. And here's another thought--if benevolency has been evolving in the human race as you argue, then how did it start to begin with? What set it in motion? It had to have started with individuals. Somewhere, some one had better morals than the others around him or her. \n \n \nAnd that's exactly the point I'm trying to drive home here. You say there isn't, I say there is. We are NOT saying the same thing, as you've now twice claimed. That's what I'm trying to get across here.\n\n \n But we're arguing two different models, that's all. At the end of the day, we're both for people being good and acting benevolently. How we get there is a difference in means, not ends. \n \n \nThere are people with mental disorders which prevent them from telling right from wrong, and those who simply were never taught. But by and large yes, when people do something immoral they know that it's wrong. That's why they feel bad about it, or rationalize their actions, if their moral sense is developed enough to care at all.\n\n \n I'd say they know that people, in general, frown upon it and that society disapproves. I would not go so far as to say that they're somehow tapped into (or participating in) some universal morality making them regret their actions or thinking 'this is wrong' while they're raping someone. \n \n \nThen what you're describing is some who hasn't developed any morals to the point where they effect him.\n\n \n Right! Excellent. HE hasn't developed the morals--not entering into some universal morality. \n \n \nthe rapist knows that he shouldn't rape but doesn't care. He knows what's considered right, \n\n \n But he only knows that other people out there don't want him to rape. THAT'S really all it is. He knows society frowns on it. Now that may play out in guilt and regret, but I see no reason to think it's any more than him knowing people are against his actions. \n \n I think a better way to describe what you're talking about is \"having a conscience\". Everyone probably has some degree of a conscience; I don't think that's the same thing as morals; it's certainly not what I think of as morals. But even peoples' consciences can vary somewhat from person to person!\n \n \nWhat he does not do is develop some code whereby raping is considered good.\n\n \n I think you've misunderstood here--I'm not saying he think's it's benevolent to rape. (is that what you mean by \"good\"?) I'm saying that his morals are only about the benefit he gets from raping and in that sense it's 'good' to him. It IS good from his perspective, because it fulfills him. I've not argued that he thinks it's a benevolent act. But his morality is different from others'; he forces his need for personal fulfillment on people--those are different morals than most people.\n \n \nI really wish you would pay more attention. First off, the points of disagreement on what is right and wrong are few and far between; people are vastly in agreement about what is moral. \n \n \n I don't think so! In your world, there would be no moral delimmas; no moral debates. Everyone would just know! They'd all be in agreement. Everyone would know that going to war for the wrong reasons is wrong, there would be no racism, no cases of genocide in the world. World hunger would not be an issue. And even in the way you responded to my examples earlier in social debates like the death penalty, it was still disagreement on which one constituted the MORE moral action. (satisfying the victim's families, or not killing someone else.) I don't see vast agreement there.\n \n \nTry to look at it the other way. If you were right, and everyone could call whatever they liked moral, then why do we have so much agreement about right and wrong, even across cultrural and religious lines? Why don't we have 6 billion distinct moral codes, most of which are incompatible with the rest?\n\n \n The areas that we have agreement on are only the areas that happen to benefit society (and really not even all of them!). We don't have agreement on other things. Like I said earlier, IMO there's a difference between conforming to society's rules and having a moral code. Now I do think those can overlap--obviously they do in many cases.",

If you just don't want to debate here because you don't want to debate, just say so. There's no need to act like you didn't have my understanding of morality right in front of your eyes from early on--you just either missed it or ignored it.\n \n And just to make the record clear to others--the main disagreement from the get-go was whether morality (HOW EVER it's defined) is universal or not. It doesn't really matter, in this case, how morality is defined because there's no reason to think morality by ANY definition would be truly universal.
