   "What's everyone's opinion on them?\n \n -Wez\n\n \n Less than enthusiastic!\n \n I'm very concerned by this proposed scheme- firstly how much is everyday person going to have to fork out on one of these things? The London School of Economics (LSE) has just published an analysis on the likely expense of implementing the system and has said that the governments \u00a35.88bn over 10 years is far too low and a cost of \u00a312-18bn is far more likely. In their estimation that is a minimum cost range as it does not consider the cost of legal battles against organisations (like Liberty) and individuals whose chose to refuse cards on moral/legal grounds. LSE decribes these costs as being \"substantial\".\n \n Remember the Poll tax? groups set up to give legal advice to those who refused to pay their tax, and this organised opposition cost the judicary large sums of money fighting battles against the objectors. The same could happen with ID cards- with the advent of the WWW opposition will be on an altogether larger and co-ordinated level.\n \n This sounds like the scheme could be very costly- and the government has already indicated it will pass the cost of the scheme on, in part at least, to the citizens (well, subjects if we are to be exact) of the UK. How often will the ID card then have to be renewed? how much is that going to cost? we already have 10 year passports and 10 year photocard driving licences which we pay for.\n \n Cost aside there are the more serious issues around how ID cards will affect our day to day lives:\n \n -what will become dependent on them?\n -will we have to carry them at all times?\n -when will be obliged to produce them?\n -under what circumstances will the Police be able to insist we show our ID card?\n -what will the consequences (ie. criminalisation) of not producing an ID card when required?\n -how quickly can a replacement be arranged?\n \n I'm also worried that once we have ID cards we are stuck with them forever more. In addition, once a scheme is passed in law it them becomes much easier to alter it to tighter limits than would have been acceptable at its introduction- ie. to begin with it might only be necessary to produce an ID card when requested at a Police station within 7 days, as applies a driving liscence at the moment. This law could then be altered in the future, for example, to make them mandatory to carry at all times.",

But usually you only get asked for ID if you look under 18 or in some places 21.\n \n With a credit card, we have a method of Chip and pin where you enter your pin number into the keypad once your card has been swiped, before that was introduced a signature was used to verify identity.\n \n To rent a movie, when you join a Rental shop you can produce 2 forms of ID such as a house hold Bill or a bank statement, then you can rent any movie you want as long as you meet that age restriction of the film.\n \n For Withdrawing money, you usually go to a cash machine(ATM) to lift money.

   "Here is one reason to dislik the UK National ID card\n http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/article_18169.shtml\n \nHome Office disagrees but hides behind \"commercial confidentiality\" card...\n \n The cost of the government's proposed biometric national ID card scheme will more than treble to \u00a318bn, according to a report by experts at the London School of Economics (LSE).  \n A regulatory impact assessment by the Home Office last year put the cost of the controversial ID card scheme at around \u00a35.5bn over 10 years but the LSE study to be released later this week estimates the actual cost will work out at between \u00a312bn and \u00a318bn. That would mean the cost of a biometric ID card rising from the current Home Office figure of \u00a393 paid by each citizen to a cost of more than \u00a3300 per individual.\n \n \n snip\n \n Hosein also questioned the suitability of multiple biometric identifiers to be used in such a vast and complex project. \n \n \"There aren't any large-scale biometric ID schemes like this anywhere in the world. I don't think biometric technology was made to be done on this scale,\" he said. \n \n The Home Office said it disagreed with the LSE figures but declined to reveal the cost of setting up the ID card scheme citing \"reasons of commercial confidentiality\". \n \n A spokeswoman also declined to comment on why the government figures should be trusted when it had already revised the cost and purpose of the ID cards upwards three times from an initial \u00a325 per card back in 2003 to the current figure of \u00a393.\n \n\n \n In USD that would be something like 30-40 billion dollars.

   "Later of course you could add a whole load of useful stuff onto it, so that rather than Sainsbury's, Nightclub, Petrol cards etc it all gets added onto the current one along with NHS files so ambulance workers and docters can get instant case history (unless you purposely chose not to have it added by going private or suchlike). As a precaution its not hard to imagine ID insurance (maybe compulasory like car insurance) so ID theft amounts to little more than someone from eastern europe gaining entry to the UK for a bit, but with not problems for you - much in the same way as credit card fraud. However ID cards are going to be a lot more personal - an email (to your official government address, if they don't mind giving us a physical one based on where we live seems odd that they can't give us an official electronic one based on who we are) informing us of what was done is hardly too much - whilst the odd video rental one a weekend might go unnoticed, a visa to Kiribati might raise a few eyebrows",

   "Well, the Government won the vote in the commons this evening with a cyncial compromise on the issue of ID cards not being complusory. So now we have a \"voluntary\" ID card scheme until 2008 when you will have to get one if you make passport application. I'm very unimpressed and feel sorry for the 20 Labour MP's who had the guts to rebel but will be judged against the complicity of their fellow party members when the next election comes round.",

   "I absolutely agree with the anti-ID card sentiments.\n \n My business is my own, unless I am comitting a crime the Police have no right to know who I am or what Im doing. If they do suspect me of comitting a crime there already exist adequate, totally voluntary, methods of verifying my identity.\n \n The passing of the ID Cards bill will lead, in effect, to making ID cards manditory by the \"back door\" as it were. By 2010, if Labour are still in power, they will have passed laws requiring ID cards to be produced for any and all common, everyday tasks, to the point where other methods of verifying identification are rendered obsolete.\n \n I have a debit card, my student ID and my birth certificate, and that is all I will ever have. If any attempt is made to make ID cards manditory, overtly or otherwise, I will refuse to carry one, even if that leads to a criminal prosecution, because if people dont take a stand on such issues, we may as well just start calling ourselves a Dictatorship today and be done with it.",
