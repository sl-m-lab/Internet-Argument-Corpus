   "I say waste this guy, the sooner the better....What say you?\n \n I know \"Little Man\" won't agree though....... :) \n \n http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/21/courtmartial.akbar.ap/index.html\n \n Soldier guilty of premeditated murder in deadly Kuwait grenade attack\n \n Friday, April 22, 2005 Posted: 0353 GMT (1153 HKT)\n \n \n FORT BRAGG, North Carolina (AP) -- An Army sergeant was convicted Thursday by a military jury of premeditated murder and attempted murder in a grenade and rifle attack that killed two of his comrades and wounded 14 others in Kuwait during the opening days of the Iraq war.\n \n Hasan Akbar, 34, now faces a possible death penalty, which the 15-member jury will consider at a hearing that begins Monday.\n \n Prosecutors say Akbar told investigators he launched the attack because he was concerned U.S. troops would kill fellow Muslims in Iraq. They said he coolly carried out the attack to achieve \"maximum carnage\" on his comrades in the 101st Airborne Division.\n \n The verdict came after 2 1/2 hours of deliberations following seven days of testimony in a court-martial -- the first time since the Vietnam era that an American has been prosecuted on charges of murdering a fellow soldier during wartime.\n \n Akbar stood at attention as the verdict was read by the colonel who headed the jury panel. The defendant chewed his lip but gave no other outward sign of emotion. Defense attorneys acknowledged that Akbar carried out the attack but argued he was too mentally ill to have premeditated it and was fueled by emotion.\n \n Killed in the middle-of-the-night attack were Army Capt. Christopher Seifert, 27, who was shot in the back, and Air Force Maj. Gregory Stone, 40, who suffered 83 shrapnel wounds. The 101st was preparing to move into Iraq in support of the U.S. invasion when the attack occurred in March 2003.\n \n \"Sgt. Akbar executed that attack with a cool mind,\" prosecutor Capt. Robert McGovern said during closing arguments, cocking Akbar's unloaded M-4 rifle and pulling the trigger twice for emphasis. \"He sought maximum carnage.\"\n \n The prosecutor said Akbar planned carefully and stole grenades that would achieve maximum destruction in the brigade command section of Camp Pennsylvania in Kuwait.\n \n Defense attorney Maj. Dan Brookhart countered that Akbar was concerned the invasion of Iraq would result in the deaths of Muslims and that U.S. soldiers would rape Iraqi women.\n \n He said the prosecution's depiction of Akbar as a cold-blooded killer ignored that the defendant was sufficiently mentally ill -- though not insane -- to be confused and fearful about the impending invasion of Iraq.\n \n The defense lawyer scoffed at an Army psychiatrist's testimony that Akbar suffered merely from \"the blues\" -- not any serious mental problems.\n \n \"It doesn't Imake any sense. This guy doesn't have the blues,\" he said. \"He is mentally ill.\"\n \n Brookhart said Akbar's actions after the initial attack showed he wasn't intent on achieving maximum destruction. He said Akbar stopped his attack with a nearly full clip still in his M-4 rifle and three more grenades. He also noted the defendant didn't try to flee during the chaos following the attack.\n \n Akbar, who turned 34 Thursday, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder. Jurors -- nine officers and six non-commissioned officers -- had the ability to consider lesser charges, but chose not to.\n \n During Thursday's arguments, relatives of the victims cried when prosecutors showed pictures of the bodies on a large TV screen. When a prosecutor pointed at Akbar, nearly yelling that he was responsible, Akbar sipped from a coffee mug.\n \n If sentenced to death, Akbar would become the sixth soldier on military death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He also could be sentenced to a life sentence.\n \n The case was moved from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, home of the 101st, to Fort Bragg because the division still was in Iraq and Bragg is home of the 101st's higher command.",

Five years ago I had a 52 year old man that I supervised at work, that was the shining model of the way a man should be in real life. He is a great father /husband, employee, absoutely loved by all that work with him, me included. He is a big, strong guy, can pick up a 200 pound electric motor off of the floor, with just a grunt, but in person he is a gentle lamb...\n \n \n He is a deeply religous person, going to his church 3 days a week faithfully. I would see him often at his desk, saying a prayer over his brown sack lunch. He came to work one monday, not sayimg much to anyone, and seemed troubled. That mood being TOTALLY wrong for him, I got him in private and asked if he had problems with me , or anything else going on at work. He said no, all was fine at work, it was something that had happened to him at church yesterday. I told him I was just a ear for him, that it wasnt any of my business, but I was listen ...\n \n He told me that his preacher was having a sermon about the eye / tooth scripture posted above. As he was finishing preaching the \"turn the other cheek\" scripture, he spoke of how people really need to \"live\" that teaching, to prove their faith. He asked this man , my employee, to come up beside him by the pulpit, and be with him. My employee went up as requested and stood beside his preacher. The preacher started loudly speaking the \"turn the other cheek\" scripture again, and just as he said the \"cheeK'' word, he slapped this man so hard across his right cheek, his head went sidewise. This man has neck muscles like the guvernator too. ..\n \n As my employee told me this, his voice was cracking, making evident to me the emotional hurt and insult he recieved by being treated that way by a person he trusted and respected so much, his preacher. I asked him was his preacher now in a intensive care unit , he said no, the bible teaches him to turn the other cheek....\n \n \n If that had happened to me , the preacher would have been slapped back, except with a closed knuckle fist , and until he was on the stage floor looking up at me.. One of the reasons for so many people not having any thing to do with religion, is for this very scenario ( not always assaults, but a lot of words and personal judging by the self righteous) this man had done to him. Because when people that get fanatical about scripture, take it out of context in their OWN interpretation, and do more harm from the bibles teachings , than good, it leaves fallout. There is only ONE teaching, one verse, that I know of that will WORK for all human beings to abide by on this earth, that will deter the crimes / hateful actions against humanity . And that is...\n \n \n The old Golden Rule we had in school in the sixties: It says \" DO ONTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO ONTO YOU\" If all mankind would live by that rule and, drop that \" turn the other cheek idealology\", we would be better suited as human beings for survival in todays times. That \"cheek\" verse did NOT live in humans past that day of its teachings SO, living that \"cheek \" verse in today's society , a society that is a self centered , predatorial type, will only result in people becoming victims more often. If one wants a verse or scripture that will be a cure-all for societies ills, the old \"Do onto others \" will work. For example, I dont want to harm, rob, kill, molest, step on others for personal gain, or commit adultery with my best friends wife, etc , BECAUSE I...... jmo",

   "\n The old Golden Rule we had in school in the sixties: It says \" DO ONTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO ONTO YOU\" If all mankind would live by that rule and, drop that \" turn the other cheek idealology\", we would be better suited as human beings for survival in todays times. That \"cheek\" verse did NOT live in humans past that day of its teachings SO, living that \"cheek \" verse in today's society , a society that is a self centered , predatorial type, will only result in people becoming victims more often. If one wants a verse or scripture that will be a cure-all for societies ills, the old \"Do onto others \" will work. For example, I dont want to harm, rob, kill, molest, step on others for personal gain, or commit adultery with my best friends wife, etc , BECAUSE I...... jmo\n\n \n Do as you would be done by amounts to the same thing as turn the other cheek.

Nobody wants other people to strike them on the cheek so they should not strike others.\n\n \n \n I respectfully disagree, the golden rule is not the same idealology as the verse \"turn the other cheek and love thy enemy\" that you have posted above. . If one is \"turning the other cheek\" that means they have ALREADY been slapped. If the preacher had followed the golden rule , he would not have slapped my employee, because he would NOT have wanted someone slapping him, PLUS he would not have taken the chance of being slapped back , by this bruiser of a man. The preacher knew he could get away with it, because he knew my friends faith in the scriptures, and that he would not hit back. My buddy should have broke that guys arm off and handed it back to him...\n \n Your scripture of Jesus teaching his followers to \"turn the other cheek\" when offended, set my friend up for that assault/ridicule by his preacher. How about we keep religous scripture in the religion forum , because it has no place in a crime debate forum ?. Crimes committed on people are real, visible, touchable . Religion is a individuals personal belief in a faith unseen and unprovable by science. Posting scripture to validate or not, the usage of a death penalty is way off base in the year 2005. jmo",

Prision isnt a walk in the park, so learn to comprehend and understand reasonings past your simple minded conservative thoughts.\n\n \n Basically, 'liberal's' don't think the fetus is 'alive' and thus see nothing wrong in expelling it. Conservatives think differently. An impass.\n Many just can't grasp the notion...even if it's heavily laden in verbage used that both sides view the 'fetus' differently. IMO, most arguements between the 2 camps get no where.\n \n \n As to Duo Maxwell and others ^, ever been behind bars? Even in America?\n Not exactly a walk in the park but, closer to a walk down a dark street in a bad part of town. Most wouldn't want to be there if given another choice but it really isn't that bad. It's something you can get used to. I've personally been on both sides of the 'prison' thing. Prison is full of people who often think they're getting a fairly decent deal. Only thing is trying to figure out what to do with your time to entertain yourself.\n Conservatives want to 'punish' people who do wrong. Liberals often want to rehabilitate them or simply remove them peacefully from society so they can do no further harm.\n But, punishment can be too harsh and some can appear rehabilitarted or find a way to get back into society to cause more harm. I personally think we should sent them to a near inescapable penal colony. Yeah, some place inhospitableish. We can call it Australia. ;)\n \n Also, the economic proofs used to oppose the death penalty are about as weak as you can get.\n The simple matter of the disparity in the figures comes from the thoroughness used in most death penalty cases. More is placed on something believed to be permanent that they want to make sure they're doing it right.\n When the notion is that they're just going to lock you up (for a LONG period of time) they (judicial system) really don't give much of a **** and will stick you with a craptacular public defender if you can't afford one yourself.\n Thus, the cost is lower.\n \n So, I personally don't pay much heed in using financial issues in dealing with justice issues. Morality and other issues, I'll listen to but some one saying it's cheaper to kangaroo court some poor schmuck into a lengthy prison sentance over a viscious homocide rather than spend the time, money and effort to ensure that he's as guilty as you think is pretty pathetic.* \n Almost like how a liberal will bemoan a corporations concearn for it's share holders over thinking of the damage it does to the environment and shoddly product it pushes onto consumers. Bean counting. It's the same thing.\n * Unless I'm making the statement, then, of course, it's complety rational and good.\n \n \n Can you prove that abortions are done on a headache? \n\n Teehee, pretty large claim there however it's not a literal claim just like the bad hair day comment. VOC isn't a good debator since his points are meandering and generic.\n However, do consider there was a recent case where a woman refused a Cesarian in the US for rather selfish issues and caused the death of one of her twins she was carring. So, such extrapolation isn't too hard to believe.\n So, yes, in the realm of 40 millionish abortions in the US, it's not too hard to believe that a woman would have an abortion for such a silly reason.\n Hell, people murder citizens (living grown people) for less. \n \n ...Are YOU looking at me funny? Blam.\n ...She stole my shampoo! STAB.\n ...I'm too lazy and cheap to get a divorce (quite a few murders).\n ...Want to get even with your wife...kill the living baby.\n ...Ummm...Idonno...I just kilt em.\n \n So, if someone doesn't think the unborn is living and is chemically imbalanced (such things happen with pregnancies), it's plausabile to think one would abort a fetus for really any fricking reason imaginable. We're human after all. We do lots of things for dumb reasons.\n \n \n Hold on a sec...\n \n Yep, that chic I went to high school got an abortion because she got a ticket for running a red light. emoticon_rolleyes \n You know why you can't find much in the way of documented reasons on why people get an abortion? It's because they don't tell and most people don't ask. And most of what's presented is often hearsay.\n Something quite different than when you're pushed infront of some detectives and actually questioned over your motives for murdering someone.\n \n \nattempt to discredit my sources and i will throw a volley more back at you. \n\n You're too cute.\n Post links, ask someone to spend time refuting them then promise to bury them with more of the same if they do...almost like telling them not to even bother.

Heck, I even go there myself. emoticon_cool \n \n I'd address a post to VOR...but, really...I'd think he's got his head full of knowledge already.

Put it down to me being an Anglican if you like but I'm still stuck on the fence on this one, and my libertarian tendencies say that unless there is a compelling, incontrovertible reason to make something illegal it should remain legal.

   "Why is that weak? \n\n Because the numbers are often taken out of context and often subjectively juggled. And really don't provide a clear basis for why something is done IMO.\n \n Some are, in essence, saying: 'It cost only $1 to toss a schmuck into jail, WHAT A BARGIN!, and it cost $10 to put him to death. Sounds good to take the cheaper option. You're not doing permanet damage by executing the suspect AND, you're saving a shat load of money. Win-win as far as some are concerned.\n But, you really get what you pay for in many cases when it comes to the judicial/ penal system. Look at the OJ trial. A lot of money spent on obsfucating lawyers and legal wrangling. 'If it does not fit you must aquit'. Well, the glove would fit if he first took off that silly rubber glove he was trying to fit the leather one over and spent the same amount of time trying to fit a form fitting race glove on. Ever put on on? They don't go on like a winter mitten. But, get some expensive advice so you know how to make it appear it doesn't fit...and razzle dazzel.\n Same with a public defender. Being a person who's had some encounters with the law (I was and am aways not guilty of course ;) ) I can tell you there is a disparity in how the courts run. This is a common cry amongst liberals who can point at the numbers on who get's what punishment.\n The money spent on a death penalty case often represents the thoroughness of the prosecution in proving their case as well as the thoroughness of the defense representing the defendant.\n When you skimp on these expenses, it's reflected how thorough the case is tried.\n So, there are less 'innocent' people on death row than compared to a general population prison. \n If you think disparity in justice is a good thing, then you are close to morally bankrupt. In essence, I see the people argueing the issue of cost, not only as utilitarian (I can live with that) but as simply not caring to do the best job with criminals as possible. \n But, of course, we really can't try all suspects with the same vigilance we do in murder cases so, we really have an impass.\n So, spend some time behind bars as an innocent man (been there myself) and tell me people care equally about you as they would if you were on death row.\n There aren't many protests about freeing imprisoned people as there are for freeing a death row inmate. It's often tied to religious and idealistic attitudes. No one really cares about people in jail as they do some one who might get killed.\n Which is why we have these debates. They're more emotion driven than anything else.\n \n \n \n \nOh boy. I'm not even sure where to start with you. Let's start at where the money comes from and see what you know. Do you know how capital punishment cases are funded?\n\n It doesn't matter how they are funded. The issue is still argueing on the amounts of money spent. Which is what you were doing. Your message was 'It's cheaper to lock them up than to execute them'. Which is true in a literal sense. What I'm saying is you get less justice based on the funds (resources) spent. Otherwise, the liberals wouldn't be pointing to how many minorities, poor and disenfranchied are on death row as compared to wealthy.\n \n \n \n \nWell, that may happen in a few but it hardly represents the whole, which VOI (insanity) is trying to state. That's a clear cut use of the fallacy of composition. \n\n Well, it could be a minority of abortion cases. It's a reasonable assumption based on observations of human choices...but, we probably won't ever know for certain. The thing is, you were instantly dismissive of VORs hand waving and asked for proof when, in this subject, little will be found. And what is found is nearly always easily dismissed as either hearsay or attributed to the agendas of a fanatical anti-abortionist.\n \n \nI tried the long way. I buried him under a 7 page single space paper on why the penalty fails. He didn't respond to any of it. Besides, I know that tatic shuts him up in the past so I merely copied a post that worked (word for word) and posted it here. Do you see him responding? :) \n\n \n I know, it get's exasperating when you think you're right and you're dealing with someone who doesn't seem to want to listen or is equally dismissive of your stance and proofs. We could do the mature thing and walk away since we aren't going to get anywhere, we could try to fight them so that others won't be lead by their nonsense that goes unchalleneged or we can just mock them.\n I'm sure you're doing what you feel comfortable with but, I am reminded by that poster on the net 'Argueing on the internet is like running in the special olympics...even if you win, you're still a retard.'\n I'm here for entertainment purposes. To vent a spleen and occasionally to learn...very occasionally. It's not that I learn much of anything new but I do get insight into how other people think and what their thought processes are.\n VOR may be a highly paid, college educated person but, the vision I get is some hillbilly in a trailer with the TV playing non-stop christian channels in the background and he types away on his comp.\n \n \nI suggest you not make assumptions off of one post. VOR doesn't bother anyways. Look at his responses. Do you think he would respond to a long post as to why he's wrong? Hell no. Link postage is merely a way to even the energy expediture against him. \n\n While appearing as assumptions, they're actually based on a high level of education and experience. After a period of time it's not hard to peg a mark...or identify someone based on the limited information you're given.\n I could be way off. I sometimes am. But...not that often. \n \n \nAt least I can back my claims with proof. VOR will never be able to do that. \n\n But, backing your claims can take time. Something people who just come to vent don't really have. Besides, it's not really proof. It's more akin to haveing others support your statements. Some who do so may be subjective. Others may have an agenda in doing so. To further their own ideas.\n Both liberals and conservatives types have such bobble headed intellectuals who'll publish anything. And both sides have experts that will find some way to refute the others claims.\n I'm sure any site VOR would even dream of linking too would be dismissed as biased and non factual.\n \n \nBelieve me I tried the long way. I tried the short way. I tried mocking him. I tried translating his sentences to make him look bad. Just run a search on him to see how he respond to long posts. It's quite pathetic. I suggest you learn frm our mistakes and merely copy and paste arguments that already refute him instead of wasting more time.\n\n Translate his sentances to make him look bad?\n I agree with the conclusions that VOR makes. I'm against abortion and nominally for the death penalty. Over time, I have eased on the death penalty issue...it's just not a high priorty to execute people for me.\n I'm athiestic (agnostic) and don't draw my conclusions (how ever flawed or correct they may be) from a book...or the interpretations of that book.\n \n I don't refute him. Nor you. Just the means by which you think you're winning a debate by.\n After all, the likelyhood of your links merely being there as a reflection of your need to substantiate your beliefs is higher than you posting them with any real desire to convert the unconvertable.\n \n \n Oh, and it's entirely plausible that VOR is posting in the inflammatory manner he does purely to get people rilled up.\n For every ill concieved remark he makes, someone is willing to jump into a 90 post debate. Is he really that stupid...or some twisted puppet master.\n \n Dance my little monkey. Dance.",

The fluid is produced from the amniotic membranes and from fetus' urine. Its function is to protect the baby from temperature changes, trauma and allow it the freedom to move about and stretch. It also keeps the uterine wall expanded so it won't compress the growing fetus and placenta. The fetus swallows, breaths, and digests the amniotic fluid. By the end of the pregnancy there is approximately 1000ml (1 liter) of fluid in the amniotic sac. The fluid is basically clear or a little cloudy in color and is continually being made.

Fetal breathing movements were episodic and occurred 31.8 per cent of the time. Aanalysis of continuous recordings in 10 fetuses from 09:00 to 17:00 hours demonstrated that the percentage of time spent breathing per hour was greater in the afternoon than in the morning. The number of gross fetal body movements was also greater in the afternoon than in the morning. The percentage of time spent breathing was significantly greater during the hour following the noon meal than during the hour preceding the noon meal. It was concluded that real-time ultrasonic scanning permits identification of fetal breathing movements and that between 09:00 and 17:00 hours the character of these movements is related to the time of the day and to the ingestion of food by the mother.\n \n PMID: 637085 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] \n \n \n I don't know, is it just moving like it's breathing but not really breathing?\n \n Ok.

   "I think if anyone really wants to question Mr. Reason's reasoning, (or lack thereof,) they would make the effort to prove these judges he speaks of are not, in fact, \"liberal\" judges. My gut feeling is that you will find a majority of these judges actually wear flag lapel pins and vote Republican. With the kind of money judges make, I can reasonably assume they are Republican as the fat cats usually are. Yet again, that would expose his posts to be no more than the rightwing hate-spew that has become all too familiar. I would do it myself but I personally need no further proof of Mr. Reason's illegitimacy. I already have all the proof I need, by reading his past posts, to rest my mind, beyond a reasonable doubt, that The Voice of Reason, is anything but.\n \n Of course, if I understand Mr. Reason's positions, by my recent observations, he undeniably equates:\n \n Good=Republican conservatives\n Bad = Democrat, liberal, traitors, scumbags.\n \n It should be as easy enough to prove he's wrong on this one as it is on almost everything else he is proven wrong on so far.\n \n One thing I can say for this gentleman is that he doesn't embarass easy and he keeps getting back in the ring over and over again, regardless of the knock-outs delivered to him on a daily basis.
