Bush\n President of the United States of America\n 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W.\n Washington, D.C. 20005\n \n Dear Mr. President:\n \n We the undersigned write to you because of our concern regarding recent disclosures of a \"Downing Street Memo\" in the London Times, comprising the minutes of a meeting of Prime Minister Tony Blair and his top advisers. These minutes indicate that the United States and Great Britain agreed to by the summer of 2002 to attack Iraq, well before the invasion and before you even sought Congressional authority to engage in military action, and that U.S. officials were deliberately manipulating intelligence to justify the war.\n \n Among other things, the British government document quotes a high-ranking British official as stating that by July, 2002, \"Bush had made up his mind to take military action.\" Yet, a month later, the you stated you were still willing to \"look at all options\" and that there was \"no timetable\" for war. Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, flatly stated that \"[t]he president has made no such determination that we should go to war with Iraq.\" \n \n In addition, the origins of the false contention that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction remains a serious and lingering question about the lead up to the war. There is an ongoing debate about whether this was the result of a \"massive intelligence failure,\" in other words a mistake, or the result of intentional and deliberate manipulation of intelligence to justify the case for war. The memo appears to resolve that debate as well, quoting the head of British intelligence as indicating that in the United States \"the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\"\n \n As a result of these concerns, we would ask that you respond to the following questions: \n 1) Do you or anyone in your administration dispute the accuracy of the leaked document? \n 2) Were arrangements being made, including the recruitment of allies, before you sought Congressional authorization to go to war? Did you or anyone in your Administration obtain Britain''s commitment to invade prior to this time?\n 3) Was there an effort to create an ultimatum about weapons inspectors in order to help with the justification for the war as the minutes indicate?\n 4) At what point in time did you and Prime Minister Blair first agree it was necessary to invade Iraq?\n 5) Was there a coordinated effort with the U.S. intelligence community and/or British officials to \"fix\" the intelligence and facts around the policy as the leaked document states?\n \n These are the same questions 89 Members of Congress, led by Rep. John Conyers, Jr., submitted to you on May 5, 2005. As citizens and taxpayers, we believe it is imperative that our people be able to trust our government and our commander in chief when you make representations and statements regarding our nation engaging in war. As a result, we would ask that you publicly respond to these questions as promptly as possible.\n \n Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n Simone",

He was a winner! emoticon_rolleyes \n \n But this is truly a non-issue (not because it's not really an issue, but because if people didn't care before that their government lied them into a war, why would they care now?)\n \n This article pretty much sums up my opinion, so I don't have to do so much typing:\n \n http://www.politicalgateway.com/main/columns/read.html?col=355\n \n \nAt the time it was obvious to anyone with half a brain that the Bush administration's intelligence was \"being fixed around the policy.\" Everyone knew it, many of us were saying it, the American people ignored it, but the war went on just the same.\n ...\n Dearlove went on to state: \"The case was thin because Saddam was not threatening his neighbors and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran.\"\n \n Are you surprised by any of this? I'm not.\n \n What is surprising is the how the Democrats are clamoring, again, like little school kids on the playground during recess trying to egg on a fight between two bullies. The fact that we were misled regarding WMD's is hardly news. The fact that the intelligence was flawed and probably invented to fit the situation isn't anything new either. So what's the big deal?\n ...\n I'm sorry, but it is not the case. This is not the Watergate burglary and it is not a fabricated Gulf of Tonkin incident. It is nothing new, just a new version of something that is old - so old it has become all but too boring.\n \n The critics of the war, all of them Democrats, have accused Bush and his top aides of misusing what has since been shown as limited intelligence in the prewar period. The notes of the meeting between Dearlove and Blair now prove it. So what? The same critics have been unsuccessful in getting an investigation into the misuse of the intelligence and as long as they are in the minority they never will. What are they expecting to happen here that didn't happen in Britain? \n\n \n The only reason that Bush will not be impeached is not because no one cares.\n It's that the true leaders of the democratic party were fully behind the invasion of Iraq. Even their candidates were very in favor of it. And they just don't have nearly the stamina that the Republicans had during the Lewinski thing. \n \n I mean it's great. \n \n Clinton gets impeached for lying under oath.\n Bush says \"I don't testify.\"\n \n Clinton must be a XXXXX, that's all he had to say.\n \n Now Clinton is best buds with Bush and his family.\n \n Anyone who votes in a national election is a retard.",
