   "Pell challenges Islam - o ye, of little tolerant faith\n \n AUSTRALIA'S most influential Catholic has said the Koran is riddled with \"invocations to violence\" and the central challenge of Islam lies in the struggle between moderate and extremist forces as the faith spreads into a \"childless Europe\".\n \n The Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal George Pell, said reading the Koran, the sacred text of Islam, was vital \"because the challenge of Islam will be with us for the remainder of our lives - at least\".\n \n But in a speech to US Catholic business leaders, Dr Pell said Western democracy was also suffering a crisis of confidence as evidenced by the decline in fertility rates. \"Pagan emptiness\" and Western fears of the uncontrollable forces of nature had contributed to \"hysteric and extreme claims\" about global warming.\n \n \"In the past, pagans sacrificed animals and even humans in vain attempts to placate capricious and cruel gods. Today they demand a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.\"\n \n Dr Pell said the September 11 terrorist attacks had been his personal wake-up call to understand Islam better.\n \n He had tried to reconcile claims that Islam was a faith of peace with those that suggested the Koran legitimised the killings of non-Muslims.\n \n While there was room for optimism in fruitful dialogue between faiths and the common human desire for peace, a pessimistic response began \"with the Koran itself\".\n \n Errors of facts, inconsistencies, anachronisms and other defects were not unknown to scholars but difficult for Muslims to debate openly, he said.\n \n \"In my own reading of the Koran, I began to note down invocations to violence. There are so many of them, however, that I abandoned this exercise after 50 or 60 or 70 pages.\"\n \n Last year, Dr Pell courted controversy when he drew a link between Islam and communism.\n \n His speech on Islam and Western democracies was delivered in Florida on February 4 but only appeared on the archdiocese's website on Wednesday.\n \n Dr Pell said every nation and every religion, including Catholicism, had \"crimes in their histories\". In the same way, Islam could not airbrush its \"shadows\".\n \n Claims of Muslim tolerance of Christian and Jewish minorities were largely mythical and he wondered about the possibility of theological development in Islam when the Koran was said to come directly from God.\n \n \"Considered strictly on its own terms, Islam is not a tolerant religion and its capacity for far-reaching renovation is severely limited,\" he said.\n \n However, like Christianity, Islam was a living religion and the existence of moderate Islam in Indonesia was proof of the softening impact of human intervention.\n \n Democracy and moderation did not always go hand in hand and an \"anorexic vision of democracy and the human person was no match for Islam\", he said.\n \n http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pell-challenges-islam--o-ye-of-little-tolerant-faith/2006/05/04/1146335872951.html\n \n Kudos, George Pell!\n \n The full article can be found at\n http://www.sydney.catholic.org.au/archbishop/addresses/200627_681.shtml",

   "Many of the world's major religions have fundamentalist/extremist wings, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. I suggest you pick up a copy of Karen Armstrong's The Battle For God. \n\n I am well aware of Karen Armstrong's apology for Islamic hate. However you referring me to another book, without actually discussing anything in it for debate is, as I see it, exceptionally lazy, as is your opening statement; a truism. The old 'go look somewhere else to find the evidence that proves me right'.\n \n \n \nGiven that Islam is one of the fastest growing religions on the planet, I can see why Rev. Pell would view it as a 'challenge'.\n \n\n Since you're content to merely direct me somewhere else, rather than 'deabte'.....\n http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles6/AlJazeerahAfrica.php\n \n \nHas he read his own Bible?\n\n Have you? Are you aware of the way either the Bible or the Koran were constructed.\n \n If you understood this, you'd understand both his argument and that of Karen Armstrong's - and why she's wrong. I'll start you off, and I'll be brief.\n \n The Bible deals with man's fall into an un-ideal state. God allowed many things as a parent allows a child different behaviour. Jesus was foretold and He came basically to set us right again. Jesus is our benchmark, NOT Solomon, David, or Moses. It is why Christians worship on a Sunday, and eat pork, etc. We are NOT Jews. You wishing to draw some argument (no doubt) about the slaying by Jews of people in the OT in order to argue how this is they way Christians must act would be a straw-man... luckily I've headed that argument off.\n \n Secondly Christians continue to fail to meet this ideal. This does not make the ideal wrong. Nor does it make it not ideal. You can measure us against that. When Christians act heinously it is in spite of Christianity. When Moslems act heinously it is BECAUSE of Islam.\n \n Muhammad's career started out from a position of weakness and he argued in favour of peace and love and co-operation. However, as his power grew, especially in Medina, his words grow decidedly harsher. When his followers pointed out that some of his words were inconsistent with earlier words he claimed that God had given him a 'better' verse. This is the commonly known idea of 'abrogation'; that when two verses seem to conflict, the most recent verse is accepted.\n \n Thus the tolerant verses of his beginnings are abrogated by later verses.\n \n They are, Christianity and Islam, in one sense thus complete opposites. One starting (in Judaism) with wars, that lead to Jesus' words of peace. Islam starting off in peace and ending up favouring wars.\n \n If you wanted to be informed on this subject and use The Legacy of Jihad: Islamic Holy War and the Fate of Non-Muslims -- by Andrew G Bostom as a reference you will see him outlining the fact that Jihad (expressed as 'war' and not merely a 'struggle') is advocated by all of the major Islamic schools.\n \n That's why you're encouraged by him to read the Koran and test his words. That's good advice, hey?\n \n For more detail...\n Abrogation\n Sura 2:106 \n Nothing of our revelation (even a single verse) do we abrogate or cause be forgotten, but we bring (in place) one better or the like thereof. \n 16:101 \n And when We put a revelation in place of (another) revelation, - and Allah knoweth best what He revealeth - they say: Lo! thou art but inventing. Most of them know not.\n \n Intolerance\n Starting off with God hating non-Moslems...\n 2:6 As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is all one for them; they believe not.\n 2:7 Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be an awful doom.\n To calling Jews names...saying that the Jews are the greediest people...\n 2:96 And verily, you will find them (the Jews) the greediest of mankind for life and (even greedier) than those who - ascribe partners to Allah (and do not believe in Resurrection - Magians, pagans, and idolaters, etc.). Everyone of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years. But the grant of such life will not save him even a little from (due) punishment. And Allah is All-Seer of what they do.\n \n to actually killing non-believers\n \n 9:5 \"Slay the idolaters wherever you find them. ... lie in ambush everywhere for them. If they repent and take to prayer and render the alms levy, allow them to go their way ...\" \n 5:34,35 \"Those that make war against God and His apostle and spread disorder in the land shall be put to death or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or be banished from the land. They shall be held up to shame in this world and sternly punished in the hereafter: except those that repent before you reduce them ...\" \n 8:39 \"Make war on them until idolatry shall cease and God's religion shall reign supreme\"\n \n and not just 'idolators', but Jews too...\n \n 32.25 - \"And He has caused to descend from their strongholds the Jews that assisted them. And he struck terror into their hearts. Some you slaughtered and some you took prisoner\"\n \n You're not even meant to take non-Moslems as friends.\n Surah Al-Ma'idah\n Ayah [51] \n O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliya' (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliya' to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliya', then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust).",
