Then we issue an ultimatum to this country saying that if they dont give up all harbored terrorists, or find out where they are very fast, we will be bombing one major city in 48 hours.

IT doesn't matter worth a hill of beans if your opponent has a better economy, military, more influence or more political power. None of that means anything at all. What does it take to pull off a terrorist attack? McVeigh did it with about $3000 worth of fertilizer and fuel oil. He 9/11 hijackers did it with some plane tickets. You have to wonder if they were smart enough to charge them on a credit card.....\n \n Sure, there are folks in the middle east who know where these people are. THere are people in America that know where these people are. We know they are in Pakistan, Thailand, Saudi Arabis, Bali, and a bunch of other places. We also know there are some right here in the good old US of A. THe problem with fighting terrorists is that for all intents and purposes they are geurilla fighters. They are mobile and they are flexible, and by the time you figure out where they are and get there to do something about it, they have melted into the shadows. At one time terrorists were a little more open in their conections. We tied terrorists to the libyan government and IRan for years. Now we have a lot more trouble making such connections. Their technology has improved, making it easier for them to communicate but harder for us to detect it. THey have also become much more tight lipped and harder to infiltrate.

When applied to extremists using guerilla tactics modernized by technology, they mean little in that balance of power. \n Use your best and that enemy will respond in kind, plus gathering additional support and stepping up to the new level of aggression. I know there are enough bio and nuclear weapons unaccounted for and sold from former USSR arsenals to allow eventual retaliation to any level of aggression we care to employ.\n \n Introducing democracy to the Mideast simply isn't going to be as cut and dried as mowing down our Native Americans. Did we learn nothing from Vietnam? Iraq doesn't have China standing behind it as a threatened neighbor, but Islamic Law will never be compatible with our western style democracy without constant, overwhelming military occupation to eventually break the spirit and cultural history of Iraq.

If the bomb an airport, we take out a whole terrorist training camp, they threaten us with bio-warefare, tactically nuke an entire city. What that will make them only dig deeper? Good I want them so far underground that the light of day is forgotten by them. emoticon_xkill \n \n I am not a right winger, I am not a warmonger, I am just fed up plan and simple.\n\n \n OK yes the US should stand up for itself whenever we are threatened. However trying to impose our will on entire cities doesn't exactly strike me as being an action taken against just terrorists. You have to understand that if France came over here and somehow beat us in a war then forced us to all fly a French flag that would make about 90% of us into terrorists. So what if France nuked one of our cities after that? Well then the gloves are off. First of all France would lose all support around the globe and find little support if they face serious retaliation. Secondly you can be sure that serious retalliation would find them and they would be in serious trouble.\n \n If you are fed up then call up your senators and tell them to help prevent the next terrorist attack from occurring by helping end illegal immigration. Tell them to wake the hell up and lock down our borders. That is the first thing we have to do is make sure we are safe at our borders. I'm very surprised this hasn't happened already.\n \n \nYou want this to stop? Write your congressman and tell him that we no longer wish for them to use our tax dollars to support Israels real estate and ethnic cleansing policies. Tell them we no longer want to support the tyranical and totalitarian government of Saudi arabia. Let them know that using US tax dollars to support coups so we can install tyrant dictatorsall over the world who will give US corporations preferential treatment is unacceptable. \n \n It is fine that you are fed up enough to be willig to kill a bunch of civilians. you want it to be over, though, and you need to get fed up enough that you are willing to actually do something about it to make it better, as opposed to just striking out and making it worse.\n\n \n First of all dropping support for Israel does nothing for us at this point. Number one, the terrorists rush into and take Israel. Hello nuclear stockpile, meet your new terrorist masters. Enter the age of nuclear warfare. Then we drop support for Saudi Arabia. The country probably doesn't collapse but the government could fall leading to a worse regime in its place. That puts our entire economy at risk if Saudia Arabia and Iraq are both unable to put out oil for a period of time. This entire action would lead to another age of instability in the Middle East and the next time a country in that region invades another it may just be Iran taking hold over the region as they would be the only real power left there. At what point would you be willing to again go back to using tax payer money to protect us from problems in the Middle East?\n \n I do agree with you that killing civilians is not the answer. Probably 95% of all Arabs don't want war and just want to live their lives. However, to make things better we must also not just suddenly abandon the region. The results would be unpredictable and dangerous.",

   "Why not let the ME sort itself out? Does Israel have nuclear delivery systems that can reach any of the major three powers; China, Russia or the US? Take Israel out if they use nukes under our current WMD policy. We've been told this isn't about oil, if the ME can't produce Canada has enough reserves to last while forcing us into alternative fuels. The technology is there, all that's needed is economic rationalization. Capital investment would flood a forced changeover and reduce adaption costs to a workable level as the profits would be more than acceptable. \n \n IMO few posters realize this is a new type of war, a war of economic attrition. Bin Laden or whomever takes his place can continue to antagonize us to a point of spending roughly $250 billion a year or more until we, one way or the other, yell uncle. Even though we're the largest, we are a declining economic power feeding on our existing national wealth and the larges of foreign bond buyers with no sight of relief and a plethora of domestic economic and social problems. \n \n A simple solution, but unfortunately most Americans believe our crusades are in their best interests because that's what they're told to believe. It's patriotic, Christian and the 'right' thing to do. To repeat myself; hopefully those who support doing the right thing have amassed substantial liquid personal wealth not tied up in overvalued equity markets or bloated real estate values to tide them over while we're doing the right thing.",

   "You do realise that AQ is a proper (and CIA trained) terrorist group, so it operates in cells. Bin Laden has aboslutely no idea where most of them are, other than one or two cells running training camps that he would oversee. Countries that support them would only know where they are and who they are though efforts of inflitrating them with spies. \n No one in AQ will really know who else is in it, or how big it is, or what other cells are planning because this is the strength of the cell system - it can slowly organise to pull of a big thing with a few cells together but is very resistant to inflitration and reveals practically no information if you try to catch one of the cells.\n \n \n Bombing cities will do nothing, our secret services are better than these rogue nation's ones (they'd better be or we are in serious trouble), we probably have more idea of where specific terrorists and training camps are than they do.",

As long as we're addicted to oil, feel we must control the sources and support Israel's polices, our fiscal and quality of life situations with regard to civil rights will continue to deteriorate. We continue to underestimate our enemy and overestimate our capability of containment of that enemy. If Iraq is unable to throw off our dominance with true sovereignty, doubtful, I guarantee the Saud's oil production will become a primary target of Islamic fundamentalists. They've managed to halt Iraqi oil production with 150,000 US troops in that country, and if they reduce Saud production by only 10%, we'll see true economic chaos in world commodity markets. We're playing serious poker holding no good cards after the draw, which we forced with a bad bluff.",
