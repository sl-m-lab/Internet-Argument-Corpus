That is what the Focus on family are doing to turn people against gays, occasionally turning to some shady stuff.\n \n Why can't HRC do something to promote large scale understanding of gays and lesbians?

I thought since she took over way too much time and energy was being spent on $200 a plate dinners, $400 a person galas and the like.\n I found it elitist and pandering. \n I had a long talk with Elizabeth Birch this past summer. Jokingly she invited me into a betting pool with Hilary on how long Cheryl would last.",
