   "Guys, listen. This whole Iran, China, and pretty much the whole topic of the world having a arsenal of these nuclear weapons has made me think. Why don't we democratic countries and monarchies get rid of our nuclear warheads in an act of peace towards many countries.\n We are never going to need them. \n Half of our nuclear arsenal is from cold war era and earlier. Most of it keeps piling up. No country needs nuclear warheads. Some people remember the disasters in Japan after the nuclear strike on their land. Lots of damage. \n Nuclear missiles are not good for the planet either. If they are used in the wrong ways, it can obliterate the earth. I think this should be on our agenda for this year to rid of nuclear arms. We wil never use them. No country has the balls to get into a nuclear war whether it be with us or another country. Cause it could get serious and damage the planet badly.\n Let me know what your opinions are.",

   "You say we are never going to need nuclear weapons.\n \n From a geopolitical standpoint, of course we're never going to need to USE them, but that's not what they're for.\n \n The reason we don't just get rid of them, and don't want other countries to have them, is that while we've got total nuclear superiority no one can stop us doing anything we want to do, hence the current world situation.\n \n One dimension of the Iraq war is linked to this; it was a show of force to show the world that the US can do whatever it wants whenever it wants, and no one can do a damn thing about it.",

   "And to be honest Johnny boy, before you make any more embarrassing posts on this forum, I suggest you read a whole lot of history books and newspapers so that the next time you decide to put your thoughts on the record you actually say something factual, interesting and debate worthy.\n \n I mean it. No offense intended. Seriously. Go and do some reading. I don't know who you are, but your posts read like a 5 year old employed by Fox News.",
