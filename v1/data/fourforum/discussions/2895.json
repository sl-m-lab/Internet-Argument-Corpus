   "Has anyone noticed the strong similarities between the two current murder investigations for Laci Peterson and Lori Hacking? For one, both cases involve the husband as investigator's primary suspects. Both Scott Peterson and Mark Hacking also have a history of lying to their spouses...with Scott admitting an affair with another woman (Amber Frey) and Mark having lied about his career and schooling for years.\n \n With so much currently going on with both trials, (such as the judge in the Peterson case putting the trial on hold because of new found evidence, and the investigators in the Hacking murder digging a landfill each day looking for the body of Lori Hacking) I thought to start a discussion group here and see what everyone's opinions are.\n \n I also wanted to mentioned that Court TV just announced that Nancy Grace (I love this lady) will be keeping us updated on both trials through a live nightly broadcasts next week, at 8pm each night (Monday - Thursday). For those following either or both cases, this helps us stay one day ahead of what get printed in the newspapers. Perhaps we can use the topics she brings up as sources of discussion here as well.\n \n Susie",
