   "Whitewashing Black Racism - IBD - Investors.com\n \n \nWhy haven't national media outlets reported on the vile and violent rants of the New Black Panther Party (NBPP) thugs whose 2008 voter intimidation tactics got a pass from the Obama administration?\n \n Simple: Radical black racism doesn't fit the Hope and Change narrative. There's no way to shoehorn Bush-bashing into the story. And, let's face it, exposing the inflammatory rhetoric of the left does nothing to help liberal editors and reporters fulfill their true calling - embarrassing the right.\n \n Last week, Justice Department whistleblower J. Christian Adams came forward with damning public testimony about how Obama officials believe \"civil rights law should not be enforced in a race-neutral manner, and should never be enforced against blacks or other national minorities.\"\n \n In the wake of Adams' expose on how the Obama DOJ abandoned default judgments against the NBPP bullies for the sake of politically correct racial politics, a shocking video clip of one of the lead defendants in the Philadelphia voter intimidation case resurfaced on the Internet. It shows bloodthirsty King Samir Shabazz during a 2009 National Geographic documentary interview spewing:\n \n \"You want freedom? You're gonna have to kill some crackers! You're gonna have to kill some of their babies!\"\n \n These NBPP death threats and white-bashing diatribes are nothing new to those who have tracked the black supremacy movement. In August 2009, nearly a year ago, I reported on a sign on display outside NBPP defendant (and elected member of Philadelphia's 14th Ward Democratic Committee) Jerry Jackson's home.\n \n It reads: \"COLORED ONLY: No Whites Allowed.\" In July 2009, I interviewed poll watcher/witness Christopher Hill, whom Shabazz and Jackson called \"cracker\" several times while Shabazz brandished his baton.\n \n \"They physically attempted to block me,\" Hill recounted. He also saw a group of elderly ladies walk away from the polling site without voting while the duo preened in front of the entrance. \"If you're a poll watcher, you shouldn't be dressed in paramilitary garb,\" Hill said, as he wondered aloud at what would have happened if he had showed up in the same sort of costume.\n \n In May 2009, I reported on the affidavit of civil rights attorney and poll watcher Bartle Bull, who witnessed the NBPP thuggery in Philadelphia and reported on billy club-wielding Shabazz's election day boast: \"You're about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.\"\n \n In the fall of 2008, just days before he showed up to hector white poll workers, Shabazz told the Philadelphia Inquirer: \"I'm about the total destruction of white people. I'm about the total liberation of black people. I hate white people. I hate my enemy ... The only thing the cracker understands is violence ... The only thing the cracker understands is gunpowder.You got to take violence to violence.\"\n \n The desire to kill, subordinate and demonize white people is a staple of NBPP propaganda. An NBPP Trenton, N.J., chapter \"block party\" music video posted on YouTube calls on black followers to \"bang for freedom,\" \"put the bang right into a cracker's face,\" and \"if you're going to bang, bang for black power ... hang a cracker ... if you're going to bang, bang on the white devil ... burying him near the river bank with the right shovel ... community revolution in progress ... banging for crackers to go to hell, we don't need 'em.\"\n \n Chanting \"Black Power,\" Minister Najee Muhammad, national field marshal for the New Black Panther Party, and Uhuru Shakur, local chairman of the Atlanta NBPP chapter, issued a pre-Election Day 2008 threat to \"racists and other angry whites who are upset over an impending Barack Obama presidential victory.\"\n \n Said Muhammad: \"Most certainly, we cannot allow these racist forces to slaughter our babies or commit other acts of violence against the black population, nor our black president.\"\n \n That's rich, given that the only racists talking about slaughtering babies are the ones with New Black Panther Party patches on their puffed chests.\n \n If a Tea Party activist threatened to kill the babies of his political opponents, it wouldn't just be front-page news. It would be the subject of Democrat-led congressional investigations, a series of terrified New York Times columns about the perilous \"climate of hate,\" a Justice Department probe by Attorney General Eric Holder, a domestic terror alert from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and another Important Teachable Moment Speech/Summit from Healer-in-Chief Barack Obama.\n \n But with the racism shoe on the other foot, Team Obama and its media water-carriers are exhibiting the very racial cowardice Holder once purported to condemn. Thanks to Obama's feckless Department of Injustice, these black supremacist brutes are free to show up on the next national Election Day at polling places in full paramilitary regalia with nightsticks, hurling racist, anti-American epithets at those exercising their right to vote and at those protecting the integrity of the electoral process.\n \n The reaction of our national media watchdogs: Shhhhhhhh.\n\n \n And some have the nerve to complain about Americans who don't want to tolerate illegal immigrants and them getting amnesty in this country. Meanwhile nobody is saying a thing about the Black Panthers advocating a violent genocidal movement against whites.",

   "As opposed to FooFoo Brain Conservatives, are getting tired of the Mickey Mouse hysteria over the \"New Black Panthers.\":\n \nWell-known conservative dismisses faux outrage over New Black Panthers\n 12:46 pm July 19, 2010, by ctucker\n Because so many conservative commentators specialize in trying to make white citizens feel threatened by a black president, the agitation over alleged voter intimidation by the New Black Panthers isn't going away any time soon. Fox News, with a ratings hit, is having way too much fun with it.\n \n But any conservatives who actually think for themselves ought to take a look at a piece conservative scholar Abigail Thernstrom wrote for the National Review's Web site, in which she dismissed the case as \"small potatoes.\"\n \n Thernstrom, appointed by George W. Bush as vice-chairman of the Civil Rights Commission, is a highly-respected conservative scholar with a long record of criticizing affirmation action and other policies on race that she dismisses as \"politically correct.\" But she refuses to go along with the trumped-up outrage over the New Black Panthers. She wrote:\n \n The two Panthers have been described as \"armed\" - which suggests guns. One of them was carrying a billy club, and it is alleged that his repeated slapping of the club against his palm constituted brandishing it in a menacing way. They have also been described as wearing \"jackboots,\" but the boots were no different from a pair my husband owns.\n\n Well-known conservative dismisses faux outrage over New Black Panthers | Cynthia Tucker",
