   "So many people are going backwards in the problems of the Palestinian-Israeli Crisis when we must look forward for the answers to solving this conflict. Today State of Israel is taking historical ground breaking actions that are a move towards peace. 500 Palestinian prisoners have been released from Israeli prison. Many of who were never charges with a crime. The Israeli government promising not to destroy any more Palestinian homes in retaliation for Palestinian acts of aggression. Prime Minister Sharon promising to pull out the Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip by July 2005. This is the first step in the right direction toward peace that has been made in a long time. \n \n The Israelis are still planning on controlling the border around the Gaza Strip including between Egypt, the Mediterranean Sea as well as the air space. The international community of nations needs to help the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip create a viable independent state. The creation of jobs and a strong economy for the people in the Gaza Strip should be at the top of the list. Improving the condition of life of the people in the Gaza Strip and West Bank of Palestine will bring peace and security to the people of the Holy Land once the borders of a the two states are agreed upon by both parties. The border of the City of Jerusalem will be the big stumbling block between the two states coming to agreeable terms.\n \n Take the debate forward looking for new and creative ideas to resolve this crisis. Stop rehashing the past and take it into the future focusing on how we can resolve the problems of today. Only by coming to term with the problems will we find the answers. The international community of nations must have a massive aid program immediately to help the Palestinian people reconstruct the infrastructure and economy of their state. The international community of nations cannot afford to let this situation deteriorate backwards neither can the State of Israel or the Palestinian people. The State Palestine as an act of good faith could offer residency to Peace Now Israelis as well as Israeli couples that are mix marriages of Jewish and Muslim people. \n \n If the government of Israel and Palestine come to a bilateral peace agreement both side will greatly benefit from. The Jewish people for the first time will have a homeland in peace opening new doors with the international community of nations. The status of State of Israel will greatly improve among the nations of the world creating new opportunities for the people of Israel. New and stronger diplomatic ties will form with the people of Israel creating new bridges of understanding and trust between the people. With the State of Israel coming to agreeable terms Land for Peace the international community of nation will guarantee the security of Israel from any foreign attacks. Similar as any attack on any Eastern European nation is an attack on NATO.",
