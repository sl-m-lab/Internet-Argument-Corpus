   "Simone,\n Thank you for your thoughtful questions.\n \nA visible church? Why is it so important to found a visible church?\n\n Why a visible church? To lead the people in Jesus' stead after he was gone. More importantly, Jesus was God incarnated. He put a face on God. He was the spirit of God enfleshed. He was physical and VISIBLE...no longer an unseen, ethereal, spirit God. This is the most profound reality of God humanity has ever experienced. Jesus also established sacraments that give visibility to invisible graces of God through his Church that strengthen our bond with God. Thus the body and the physical show us the invisible goodness of God and truths about God. \n \n The physical is an integral part of our relationship with God. So therefore, in keeping with the Incarnation...of bringing God into a visible, intimate form... Jesus established a visible church to give flesh to the spiritual and continue his mission. He did this so that we would not have all of these questions about the 33,000 different takes on Christianity, to eliminate false prophets. He did this so that we could be sure without fail of his message to us. He did this to eliminate confusion and solidify our union with him.\n \n Why the Church? Why the Incarnation? Why the scourging? Why the Crucifixion? Why the Resurrection? \n \n Because that's the way he chose for Redemption of the world and all mankind. He came into the world to be with us as intimately as possible and he still resides with us everyday especially in the Church and her sacraments--very specifically the Eucharist. \"Lo, I will be with you always even to the end of time.\"\n \n \nAuthority? Did Jesus demand that he have \"authority\"?\n\n \"All authority on heaven and earth has been given to me.\" Matthew 28:18.\n \n \"I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" Matthew 16:19\n \n \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.\" John 20:22-23\n \n \nWhy is there so much obsession with authority? What is this thing \"authority\" that it is so important?\n\n When I say authority, its importance is not one of rule and dominion although the followers must be obedient. Its primary import is to maintain the unity of the Church and prevent distortion of the truth.\n \n \nMarching in lockstep? Is it necessary for the members of the church march in lockstep? Um, you know what that sounds like.\n\n Although the Church is universal and accepting of all cultures, races, and nations there must be unity within that diversity. The Church is all things to all men so that it can relate to all men--as Jesus would have. But this relation does not compromise essential truths--just as Jesus did not compromise the truth. That is where all must march in lockstep. If you do not then you end up believing, practicing, and professing a different creed than the Church and a different creed than Jesus left us. \n \n John 17:20-23 \"I do not pray for these only, but also for those who believe in me through their word, that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they may also be in us, so that the world may believe that thou has sent me. The glory which thou hast given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and thou in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them even as thou hast loved me.\"\n \n \nAs a former Christian and a thoughtful student of the teachings of Jesus, I found it necessary to disavow the authoritative church as being unworthy of calling itself an authority to lead followers of Jesus. Authority smacks more of coercion than of love and even Benedict XVI must own that love is the heart of the matter.\n\n Sometimes authority is love. We know this simply by looking at the relationship of parents to children, teachers to children, and definitely Mother Church to her children.",

What authority did it hold if the Son of God did not bring it?\n\n obviously at some poipnt someone with some objectivity and a desire to see things go right analysed the world condition and found it lacking terribly. this happens as we grow older; our experience and field of vision broadens. but does this \"trend\" of the world getting \"worse\" with time imply that if we go back in time far enough, that man was at one point perfect? this is what the bible suggests, and is central to the entire doctrine of christianity, since it promises to restore mankind, at least spiritually, to the status of perfect once again.\n \n in reality, is \"redemption\" needed to curb the greed, violence, poverty, abuse, etc in the world?first of all this assumes that man was perfect at some point, which would imply that genesis is at least partially true. second, it assumes that man can be restored to this perfect state by believing that he has been redeemed. i dont know about you, but even though a motivational seminar might make you believe you can be rich, it takes a lot more than that to actually make you rich.\n \n leading people to be \"good\" requires much more than a belief. it requires a program, or should i say programming. people can become what they desire to become, but they need to be programmed to do so. the church used to work this way, but recently lost their effectiveness because opposing programming surpassed a critical mass, and it undermined church programming.\n \n i think im beginning to rant, but basically what im saying is christianity seems to me to have much more political roots than spiritual. the spiritual realm need not even exist for the concept to be effective.",

Even if you say that it's due to technology, a truly \"enlightened\" society would have recognized the killing power of modern technology and adjusted its actions accordingly.\n \n One doesn't have to subscribe to the specific view of sin and atonement in the Bible to see that people are capable of some pretty horrible things, and small things as well, that are still wrong.",

I suspect the same can be said of voting in some cases, but I'd have to do some research to know for sure.

The terminology that was used must have raised eye brows, because that is the exact same terminology that Augustus used when promotiing his worship as the Divine Son of Julius Caesar. Read up on it.

Why would Jesus say, \"You are Peter, and on this rock of myself I will establish my church?\" Remember he was responding to Peter's affirmation that he was the Son of God. \n \n One must consider that Jesus would have said the aramaic word for rock which is kepha. The same word means Peter. The verse (Matthew 16:18) would have been, \"You are kepha, and on this kepha I will build my church...\" The word play relating Peter to the rock is obvious. We know Peter was, in fact, kepha because he is called such in scripture (albeit a Greek rendering): John 1:42, 1 Corinthians 1:12, 1 Corinthians 3:22, 1 Corinthians 9:5.\n \n Furthermore, none of the early Church Fathers at the beginning times of the Church understood the verse in that way. Their writings show that they believed Peter to be the rock:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Origins_of_Peter_as_Pope.asp\n \n Finally, it really doesn't matter in this case whether the rock is Jesus or Peter. The historical fact remains that the Church that Jesus established whether on the rock of himself or Peter was the Catholic Church. Should one trust in the original Church that Jesus himself established?",

   "Jesus is not the rock in this context. Peter is the rock. Peter means rock. This is why Jesus called Simon \"Peter\".\n\n \n You need to go into more depth, Jo:\n \n In the Gospel of Matthew we read: \n \n Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He began asking His disciples, saying, \"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?\" And they said, \"Some say John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.\" He said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\" And Simon Peter answered and said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" And Jesus answered and said to him, \"Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades shall not overpower it.\" ?Matthew 16:13-18\n \n The Roman Catholic Church interprets Jesus here to say, \"You are Peter, and upon you, Peter, I will build My church.\" Peter would be the rock upon which the Church would be built [552, 586, 881]. He would be the \"prince of all the apostles and visible head of the whole church.\"\n \n There are several problems with this interpretation. The first is that someone reading Matthew's Gospel in Greek, the original language of the New Testament, would not have immediately concluded that Peter was the rock. In the Gospel of Matthew, when Jesus said to Simon, \"You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church\" (Matthew 16:18), His choice of words was significant. Though Peter?s name means rock (petros), Jesus did not say, \"You are Peter (Petros), and upon this rock (petros) I will build my church.\" What He said was, \"You are Peter (Petros), and upon this rock (petra) I will build My church.\"\n \n The word Jesus chose to use for rock, petra, is a feminine noun that refers to a mass of rock. The New Testament uses this word in Matthew 7:24,25 to refer to the bedrock upon which a wise man built his house. Petra is also found later in Matthew?s Gospel with reference to Jesus? tomb, which workers had carved out of solid rock (Matthew 27:60).\n \n Peter's name, Petros, on the other hand, is masculine in gender and refers to a boulder or a detached stone. Greek literature also uses it of a small stone that might be picked up and thrown.\n \n What Jesus said to Peter could be translated, \"You are Stone, and upon this bedrock I will build My church.\" His choice of words would indicate that the rock on which the church would be built was something other than Peter.\n \n Anyone reading the Gospel of Matthew in the original Greek language would have noticed the difference. The reader would have had to pause and decide what was meant by \"upon this rock\" (Matthew 16:18). The reader would not immediately have equated the rock (petra) with Peter (Petros), because the words are different.\n \n To determine the best interpretation, the reader would have had to look more closely at the context. This is the second and greatest weakness with the Roman Catholic interpretation: It fails to give proper emphasis to the context.\n \n The context of Matthew 16:13-20 is not about Peter; it is about Jesus. It starts with a question that Jesus raises about His identity: \"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?\" (Matthew 16:13). It reaches a climax with Peter?s declaration: \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God\" (Matthew 16:16). It concludes with the Lord warning His disciples \"that they should tell no one that He was the Christ\" (Matthew 16:20).\n \n When Peter correctly answered Jesus? question as to His identity, the Lord remarked, \"Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven\" (Matthew 16:17). Peter?s insight into Jesus? true identity was a revelation from God. In this context, Jesus, making a play on words, says, \"You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church\" (Matthew 16:18).\n \n The context argues for interpreting \"this rock\" as referring back to the revelation and its content. In other words, the Lord Jesus as \"the Christ, the Son of the living God\" (Matthew 16:16) would be the solid rock upon which the Christian faith would rest. Every doctrine and practice would be founded upon Him. Every true believer would hold to a common conviction: Jesus is \"the Christ, the Son of the living God\" (Matthew 16:16).\n \n The cultural context of the passage also supports interpreting \"this rock\" as referring to Jesus in His identity as the Son of God. Matthew wrote his Gospel for a Jewish audience. He expected his readers to be familiar with Old Testament imagery.\n \n How would a Jewish reader interpret \"upon this rock\"? G. Campbell Morgan answers, \"If we trace the figurative use of the word rock through Hebrew Scriptures, we find that it is never used symbolically of man, but always of God.\" For example:\n \n There is no one holy like the Lord; Indeed, there is no one besides Thee, Nor is there any rock like our God. ?1 Samuel 2:2\n \n For who is God, but the Lord? And who is a rock, except our God? ?Psalm 18:31\n \n Is there any God besides Me, Or is there any other Rock? I know of none. ?Isaiah 44:8\n \n The wider context of the New Testament also confirms that Jesus, not Peter, is the rock. For example, Peter himself wrote of Christ as a rock (petra):\n \n For this is contained in Scripture: \"Behold I lay in Zion a choice stone, a precious corner stone, and he who believes in Him shall not be disappointed.\" This precious value, then, is for you who believe. But for those who disbelieve, \"The stone which the builders rejected, this became the very corner stone,\" and, \"A stone of stumbling and a rock (petra) of offense.\" 1 Peter 2:6-8\n \n Paul also refers to Christ by the Greek word petra. In Romans he wrote of Christ as \"a rock (petra) of offense\" (Romans 9:33) over which the Jews had stumbled. In First Corinthians he wrote of a spiritual rock encountered by Israel in the wilderness. He identified that rock, saying, \"...and the rock (petra) was Christ\" (1 Corinthians 10:4).\n \n (reachingcatholics.org)\n \n Cheers....",

But I will reiterate and elaborate here.\n \n Peter the Rock\n There are many problems with a denial of Peter as the foundation of the Church in Matthew 16. There are the problems of language and translation, grammar, geography, significance of the keys as it relates to the Old Testament, the reason for name changes, and the testament of the Church Fathers. There are too many indications in scripture of Peter's primacy to be discounted as mere coincidence.\n \n Was it necessary that Christ establish Peter as the anchor and foundation of his Church? One might just as well ask if the Incarnation of Christ was needed by God our Father to bring about our salvation. God is omnipotent and omniscient so it is a denial of God to say that he could not grant us salvation without embodying Himself in Christ. Yet, he sent Christ, though He is capable of performing Christ's mission Himself without taking on human form (excluding any Trinitarian chicken versus egg tangents). Why did He do this? We can never fully know. We can never fully grasp, as humans, God's plan and will. Yet He did will that Christ be our Savior. Perhaps, it was the best way to make humans understand (as much as possible) his plan. He related to us on our level. So too, Christ did not need Peter, but he chose Peter. Christ was the most efficacious way of bringing about our salvation and Peter was the most efficacious way of establishing Christ's Church on earth. The statement of Paul on Christ does not exclude the statement of Christ on Peter. As Christ was the cornerstone that the Jews rejected because they didn't recognize him, Peter is the stone of foundation for the Church that Protestants reject because they do not recognize him.\n \n In Greek, \"Petros\" is used to refer to the name of Peter while \"petra\" is used to refer to the rock. The claim is that \"petros\" refers to a small stone, while \"petra\" refers to a massive rock. Therefore, Christ is referring to Peter as a small stone and to the declaration of faith or Himself as the large stone. There are several problems with this argument. The major problem is the fact that the Greek does not matter. Jesus did not speak in Greek; he spoke in Aramaic. Matthew's Gospel was originally written in Aramaic. In Aramaic the word for rock is \"kepha.\" Remember that Peter is referred to as Cephas and Kephas in scripture also.\n \n The use of \"petros\" and \"petra\" came about with the translation from Aramaic to Greek. The Greek word for rock, \"petra,\" is feminine in gender. Although it could be applied to the reference to a stone rock, it could not be applied to Peter as a name because he was obviously a male. The substitution of the masculine \"petros\" was necessary. That is why it appears to many whom are ignorant of the subtleties of Greek (myself included) that Jesus is saying, \"You are a little rock (petros) but upon this big rock (petra) I build my Church.\" Another refutation of this meaning is the fact that petros and petra were synonyms in first century Greek. The distinction between the two words was gone by the first century. If the author wanted to make a distinction he would have used the Greek word lithos.\n \n So for a closer idea of what Christ said, one must substitute the Aramaic, \"You are kepha and upon this kepha I build my Church.\" The true play on words Jesus intended can be seen using the Aramaic. The English rendering of this is closer to the original than the Greek because English nouns do not express gender. It could just as well be written, \"You are Rock and upon this rock I will build my Church.\" ** The name change, in itself, is significant. The change of name was a change of role or vocation as in the name changes pronounced by God upon Abram (Abraham) to become the father of the faith and Jacob ( Israel) to become the progenitor of the tribes of Israel named after his sons. (If Jesus would have said, \"You are Simon and on the rock of your profession I build my Church\" then I could see your idea on Peter's profession. However, with the name change occurring at that very moment along with the grammar problems, and what I discuss below, this theory does not hold up). \n (** from www.catholic.com click on Peter and the Papacy) \n \n One must also consider the geography. Jesus and the apostles were in the district of Caesarea Philippi (Matthew 16:13). This city was built and named by Philip Herod in honor of Caesar Augustus to gain favor with Rome. The city was formerly named Panias in ancient times in honor of the god Pan. The ruins of this ancient city lie near a huge rock promontory 200 feet high and 500 feet long that are part of the Mount Hermon range of mountains. Pagan idols once decorated this mountain. Father Stanley Jaki describes it thus in his book And On This Rock, \"A splendid pagan city lying in clear sight of a huge wall of rock. At the top of that wall there glitters the white marble of a temple dedicated to Caesar. At the bottom, there is an outwardly idyllic sanctuary of Pan. Immediately to the left of that sanctuary there is a fathomless cavity full of water, one of the three sources of the Jordan.\" One of three sources of the river Jordan flowed from this mountain. The Jordan gave life to Israel. Jesus knew the power of symbolism, as no one will argue when they read the numerous parables of the gospels. The faith of Christianity flows through the rock of Peter to give life as the Jordan flowed through the other rock. The cavity mentioned in the quote was known by the inhabitants as the \"Gates of Sheol\" -but the gates of hell would not prevail against Peter and the Church. Besides the symbolism effected above, Jesus was definitely trying to drive home two important points to the apostles: 1) Christ is true God, not Caesar or Pan 2) the temple of the false gods are built upon a huge, unmovable rock but Christ's Church would be built upon the more immense rock of Peter. Remember Jesus' teaching earlier in Matthew that one must build upon a foundation of rock, not upon sand. The Church of Christ is built upon Christ the cornerstone primarily and Peter the Rock secondarily. ** \n \n (**Patrick Madrid, Pope Fiction (Santa Fe: Basilica Press, 1999), 37-50. Karl Keating, Catholicism and Fundamentalism (San Francisco: Ignatius Press), 198-214)\n \n The next issue is the \"keys of the kingdom.\" Again Jesus uses Old Testament parallel and symbolism. The authority to bind and loose was given to all of the apostles as indicated by the plural Greek in Matthew 18:18. I have no argument with that. But the fact that it was given to Peter first and in a special way in Matthew 16:19 is relevant and this is indicated by use of the singular pronoun. Only Peter was given the keys. What's the big deal about the keys? Read Isaiah 22:15-25. In ancient times cities were walled. Huge gates guarded the entrance and could only be unlocked by huge keys. The kingdoms of ancient times were obviously ruled by kings. However, the king could not be continuously running to the gates to let people into the city. So the king gave the keys to the city to his steward. Keys that were so big the steward had to carry them on his shoulder. The steward controlled whom the king would and would not see. (This is the origin of the modern honor of giving someone a key to the city.\n \n As one reads Isaiah 22, he realizes how much authority the steward possessed. He was second only to the King. He was Prime Minister. Peter was designated as the steward/prime minister of Christ. Christ is the King. Look at the Old Testament reference to Daniel 7 in Luke 1:32-33, \"...and the Lord will give to him the throne of David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n Then read closely the passage of Isaiah... \"Come, go to this steward, to Shebna, who is over the household...and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your girdle on him, and will commit your authority to his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David; he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. And I will fasten him like a peg in a sure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house. And they will hang on him the whole weight of his father's house, the offspring and issue...\" Jesus knew Old Testament scripture better than anyone. He was making parallels between the keys of his heavenly kingdom and the way the keys were passed in the ancient kingdoms of Israel! Jesus would ascend his throne in heaven and leave Peter as his steward on earth (thus Peter's supremacy as Pastor does not contradict Christ's role as chief shepherd, rather Peter's supremacy comes from and is designated by Christ to rule the earthly Church once Christ was in heaven). All authority is committed to Peter's hand to rule over the household of his Father. \"None shall open what he shuts\"=none shall loose what he has bound and vice versa. He would become a throne of honor to the father but he does not detract from the Father. He has only the power granted to him by Christ but this power is much greater than Protestants pretend. \n \n Now consider also the significance of the pope speaking ex cathedra, that is \"from the chair.\" What chair and why is this chair so important? This chair is the chair of Moses. In Matthew 23 Jesus told his disciples to do what the Pharisees told them to do because they sat on the chair of Moses. \"Do what they tell you, but not what they do.\" Read Exodus 18 explaining the chair of Moses. It was the chair of judgement, the chair from which Moses instituted God's laws. Jesus put a new steward in the chair. As Moses was given his authority at Mount Sinai by God, Peter was given his at the mountain of Caesarea Philippi by Jesus. Moses had the power to judge, \"Moses sat to judge the people.\" He also had teaching authority, \"and you shall teach them the statutes and the decisions, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.\" Peter has these powers because he sits on the new chair of the Church. Moses spoke for God and Peter spoke for Jesus. \n \n Another clear example of Peter's primacy can be found in the Gospel of John, chapter 21: 15-19. Jesus' words here designate Peter as shepherd. Jesus again singles out Peter to lead the flock, in effect Jesus appoints Peter to be the chief shepherd. The Church did not appoint Peter shepherd, it only recognizes that Christ appointed him shepherd. The Church is obedient to Christ in accepting Peter. If one thinks that the designation of shepherd is not a designation of leadership then remember how often Christ referred to himself as the shepherd. \n \n Now, there is a volume of other evidence pointing toward Peter as prime minister that is more than coincidence, as I mentioned above. Although Peter was not the first to be called, after being called he always seemed to be first. In Matthew 10 he is listed first in the list of the apostles. The Greek word protos is used to designate him. This word means \"foremost,\" \"best,\" or \"chief.\" Peter's name is listed first in every scriptural listing of the apostles and sometimes they are referred to as \"Peter and the others.\" (Judas is always listed last). Peter's name is mentioned 195 times in the New Testament, more than all of the other apostles added together. The next closest is John at 34 times. Jesus chose Peter's boat from which to preach and work miracles. Peter is the only apostle to be personally prayed for by Jesus (Luke 22:31-32) and he tells Peter to \"strengthen his brethren.\" The risen Christ appeared first to Peter (Luke 24:34, 1 Corinthians 15:5) then the other apostles. Peter headed the meeting to replace Judas, he led the apostles in preaching on Pentecost and received the first converts, he performed the first pentecost miracle, inflicted the first punishment, excommunicated the first heretic, etc. As cited previously, the Church Fathers also testify to Peter's primacy.",

   "EZ,\n \nPerhaps not every rock in Scripture is God / Jesus but there's so many of them you have to acknowledge Jesus is the primary one, and can't just dismiss it on the basis you mentioned. \n\n Yes, Jesus is the primary rock. I attested to that in my last post.\n \n \nCatholic means the called out assembly (of Christ). The church is a spiritual church, vs. a structural one, with Jesus as the chief cornerstone.\n\n Was Jesus simply a spiritual God? Or was he also a physical God? Did he put on flesh and come into the world or did he remain as a spirit? \n \n \nThe earliest Christians said the stone the builders rejected is Christ (Acts 4:12), and salvation is found in no one else. \n \n The stone the builders rejected is a different stone than that of Matthew 16:18. Read the Church Fathers that I cited.\n \n \nPeter is the smaller stone / rock, second to Christ. Like I posted earlier, when Peter correctly answered Jesus' question as to His identity, the Lord remarked, \"Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven\" (Matthew 16:17).

Christ is the one who overcame the world and upon whom everything rests.\n\n Again, I attested in my post that Jesus was the primary rock and Peter the secondary one. But Peter is the rock referred to in Matthew 16:18...the Rock Foundation of the earthly Church to protect the Revelation of Jesus until he comes again. Why was Peter named a smaller rock or stone by Jesus?\n \n The context does not argue for interpreting the rock as Jesus. It doesn't make sense. I have presented this earlier.\n \n But let's say you are right for this next question. Even if the rock of Matthew 16:18 is the rock of Peter's confession, what Church was founded upon this rock? The Catholic Church? Should one trust in the Church that Jesus started or ones that mere men started?\n \n \nPlus, even Peter and Paul identified Jesus as the Rock.\n\n True.\n \n \nPeter himself wrote of Christ as a rock (petra):\n \n For this is contained in Scripture: \"Behold I lay in Zion a choice stone, a precious corner stone, and he who believes in Him shall not be disappointed.\" This precious value, then, is for you who believe. But for those who disbelieve, \"The stone which the builders rejected, this became the very corner stone,\" and, \"A stone of stumbling and a rock (petra) of offense.\" 1 Peter 2:6-8\n \n Paul also refers to Christ by the Greek word petra.

He identified that rock, saying, \"...and the rock (petra) was Christ\" (1 Corinthians 10:4).\n\n You wrote this in response to my question on why you thought Jesus renamed Peter Kephas, ROCK. It doesn't answer the question, as many of your posts here have not addressed the point at hand.\n \n \nBut you're welcome to your viewpoint.\n\n Yes. A viewpoint backed by the Church Jesus started...a living church 2,000 years old that can trace its ancestry in an unbroken line back to the apostles who walked with Jesus. How old is your church? I ask again, did Jesus start the Catholic Church? \n \n http://www.whostartedyourchurch.com/\n \n I guess we will let others decide whose presentation is more convincing. I'm going out of town for a week. I will check in when I get back.\n \n Peace.",

   "like e_faith said, you cant really stop a christian from questioning and thinking for himself. i would add, however, it is generally discouraged. the pastor is usually expected to do the thinking for the congregation, because independent thinking almost always results in dissention of the church, sometimes to the point of the congregation spliting into smaller factions, where either part of the church loses its faith completely, or creates a splinter church of its own, depending on the nature of the disagreement\n \n when people think for themselves, it upsets the equilibrium of the status quo. independent thoughts are so often opposed to what is being preached from the pulpit that it messes up what is already established. by discouraging this, the leaders in power can maintain their position and authority, and everybody is happy\n \n this is also a reason why religion and politics are such close cousins\n\n \n While I think there are churches where the pastor does the thinking, my church does not do that. People are taught, like any classroom, but are highly encouraged to dissent and discover the meaning of scripture. God communicates to us through that.

Too often other views are only seen in the context of outsiders and opponents, and religious and irreligious people snipe at each other from fixed positions.\n\n this is very different from the experiences i have had with churches personally. i grew up under the pentecostal churches, and to me they seem to be the most wholistic, in terms of fundamentalist teachings, among all churches i've studied. they take the bible literally, and deem it as totally true and inerrant, as well as plain and literal, i.e., what is says is what it means. the pentcostal church is one of your prime examples of what a fundamentalist church is. \n \n the good thing about fundamentalist doctrine is that it maintains a very high standard. god's word is absolutely true, so just do what it says. all questions are answered in the bible. fundamentalists are very versed in scriptural reference, since they base all their teachings directly out of the quoted scriptures\n \n the bad thing about it is that at some point, it is nearly inevitable that some questions about a contradiction or interpretation is going to arise, which usually causes irreconcilable discrepancies. very often a splinter of the congregation may leave the church and form its own sub-denomination. i always wondered as a child why it is \"open-bible\" churches have the most sub-denominations, and only discovered why recently.\n \n the dilema is this: how do you base a christian church on partial and derivative doctrine? among fundamentalist churches, the main thrust is that there is only ONE way to god. you must follow the biblical procedure. its not something you can achieve by your own means. or is it?",

   "this is very different from the experiences i have had with churches personally. i grew up under the pentecostal churches, and to me they seem to be the most wholistic, in terms of fundamentalist teachings, among all churches i've studied. they take the bible literally, and deem it as totally true and inerrant, as well as plain and literal, i.e., what is says is what it means. the pentcostal church is one of your prime examples of what a fundamentalist church is. \n \n the good thing about fundamentalist doctrine is that it maintains a very high standard. god's word is absolutely true, so just do what it says. all questions are answered in the bible. fundamentalists are very versed in scriptural reference, since they base all their teachings directly out of the quoted scriptures\n \n the bad thing about it is that at some point, it is nearly inevitable that some questions about a contradiction or interpretation is going to arise, which usually causes irreconcilable discrepancies. very often a splinter of the congregation may leave the church and form its own sub-denomination. i always wondered as a child why it is \"open-bible\" churches have the most sub-denominations, and only discovered why recently.\n \n the dilema is this: how do you base a christian church on partial and derivative doctrine? among fundamentalist churches, the main thrust is that there is only ONE way to god. you must follow the biblical procedure. its not something you can achieve by your own means. or is it?\n\n \n \n I find when someone from the pentalcostal background discusses theology, they never can seem to look at more than one or two sentances in a row to base their conclusions on. They reinforce their belief about the first phrase, taken out of context, with another prhase in another part of the bible, also taken out of context. It doesn't bother them that the two areas they are using are talking entirely about different things. Their theology is the theolog of sound bites.",

   "The CofE approach is more about trusting God rather than your own instinct about what the Bible means. There are two approaches to dealing with differing interpretations of the bible, one is to bury your head in the sand and say \"I'm right, everyone else is gonig to hell\", the other is to accept that there is an ambiguity, and work with others to try and discover through prayer and discussion what God actually wants.\n\n \n From what I've seen of Anglican churches here in the U.S., they vary greatly in their approach. Some are pretty open-ended in interpretation, others could practically pass for an evangelical church. We have one near where I live that has a statement of belief in line with pretty much any evangelical church I've ever seen. And then there are the Anglican churches that have split off and formed their own Anglican congregations of late so they can be free to worship in a more traditional interpretation of scripture rather than a more open-ended one.\n \n I think I'd be pretty comfortable in an Anglican church, and I personally like a more liturgical worship style.",

In the text \"Peter\" in the Greek is petros, while \"rock\" is petra. These both come from a common root, but they are diverse in meaning as the following authorities show. Liddell and Scott's Greek English Lexicon is the standard work on classical Greek, and has been for many years the standard lexicon in most colleges. This work says of petra: \"A rock, crag, Lat. Rupes, scepulus; petros being a stone, Lat. Saxum: a ledge or shelf of rock (in the sea).\" But this work under a separate entry says of petros: \"A piece of rock, a stone.\"\n \n Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, which is the standard work on New Testament Greek, remarks on the word petra: \"A rock, ledge, cliff; a. prop.: (Matthew 7:24 sq.; 27:51, 60; Mark. 15:46; Luke 6:48; 1 Cor. 10:4) (on which see pneumatikos, 3a); a) projecting rock, crag, (Rev. 6:15 sq.); rocky ground, (Luke 8:6, 13). b). a rock, large stone: (Rom. 9:33; 1 Pet. 2:6 [7]). c). metaph. A man like a rock, by reason of his firmness and strength of soul: Matthew 16:18 [some interpp. regard the distinction (generally observed in classic Greek; see the Comm. and cf. Schmidt, Syn. Ch. 51, 4-6) between petra. the massive living rock, and petros, a detached but large fragment, as important for the correct understanding of this passage;].\" Here are two standard works, one on classic and the on New Testament Greek, and they agree.\n \n The word of the Lord in Isaiah 28:16 is especially appropriate at this time for our consideration. \"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.\" None but outright unbelievers can doubt the applicability of this to the Lord Jesus, when both Paul, (Rom. 9:33-10:4) and Peter, (1 Pet. 2:6-8) quote it in relation to Christ. Note from this prophecy that the purpose of God is: (1) To lay this Stone in Zion, the place where the Church was founded. (2) The laying of this Stone was for a foundation. (3) This foundation was not to be such unstable materials as constitutes all mankind, but was \"tried. . .precious. . . sure\" as a foundation. \n \n And what of the numerous times that David makes mention of the Lord as \"The Rock of my salvation,\" and other expressions, such as: \"Who is God save the Lord? Or who is a rock save our God?\" (Ps. 18:31). \"Be thou my strong rock, for an house of defense to save me. For thou art my rock and my fortress,\" (Ps. 31:2-3). \"He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved,\" (Ps. 62:2). \"And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God was their redeemer,\" (Ps. 78:35).\n \n \"And again, what of Psalm 118:22: \"The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner,\" which is quoted in the New Testament in reference to the Lord Jesus, (Matthew 21:42; Acts 4:11). Or of Isaiah 8:14: \"And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,\" which is also quoted by both Peter and Paul in reference to the Lord. Here the word translated \"rock\" is the Greek word petra both in the Septuagint, (Greek version) in Isaiah 8:14, and in the New Testament quotations of it in Romans 9:33 and 1 Peter 2:8.\n \n The Lord Jesus is very commonly pictured in the Old Testament as the \"Rock,\" and so, any Jew who was familiar with His Scriptures would have recognized Jesus' words in Matthew 16:18 as a reference to Isaiah 28:16, and so, He it is upon whom the Church is built. \n \n We may certainly expect that the apostles would know upon whom the Church was built, and if the \"rock\" mentioned in Matthew 16:18 were Peter, he would certainly be recognized and honored as such by the other apostles.\n \n Yet such is manifestly not the case, for Paul quotes a portion of both Isaiah 8:14 and 28:16 as referring, not to a mere man, but to the Lord Himself, (Rom. 9:33). And he goes further by saying, \"And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ,\" (1 Cor. 10:4). He refers to the Rock that gave forth water to the Israelites in the desert during the forty years of wandering, but he uses the same word-petra-as is found in Matthew 16:18.\n \n But as to the foundation, he dogmatically says, \"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which Is Jesus Christ,\" (1 Cor. 3:11). Is this not clear enough for anyone? It should be, but apparently is not for some. The Church is founded upon a Rock, \"and that Rock is Christ,\" \"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\" Not only is Christ set forth as the rock that is laid for a foundation, but Scripture declares that there is no other foundation that has been, or can be, laid. Who will controvert this? To even endeavor to do so is to reveal one to have a deep-seated prejudice against the truth that results in knowing rebellion.\n \n \"For who is God, save the Lord? And who is a rock, save our God,\" (2 Sam. 22:32). See also Psalm 18:31 which quotes this. \"The Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation,\" (2 Sam. 22:47). \"The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me,\" (2 Sam. 23:3). \"Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my rock,\" (Ps. 28:1). \"For thou art my rock and my fortress,\" (Ps. 31:3). \"I will say unto God my rock,\" (Ps. 42:9). \"He only is my rock and my salvation,\" (Ps. 62:2). And many other such passages could be cited.\n \n http://www.pbministries.org/Theology/Davis%20Huckabee/Sermons%20To%20Baptist%20Churches/ch02_is_peter_the_rock.htm",

So the apostles also know that secondarily, the Church is built on the Rock of Peter. All of Peter's authority comes from Jesus (Matthew 28:18) and he would have no power or authority otherwise. He would have no power unless Jesus had given it to him and he did.\n \n Please read John 21:15-19 and keep Matthew 16:18 in mind as you do that. What do you think Jesus was doing in John 21? Did John realize Peter's role?\n \n Why do you think that 2 apostles other than Peter himself (Peter is not puffing himself up) write of the designation of Peter as the leader of the Church?

   "Well, the Catholic church was certainly astray when it was selling indulgences, and torturing heretics, and approving the crusades.\n\n If it weren't for the Crusades then we would likely be living in a Muslim world today. And the oppression of Islam is much worse than the liberty of Christianity.\n \n There were abuses and evils committed in the Crusades. One may condemn the abuse and recklessness of the Crusaders (the sacking of Constantinople for example) but can one condemn their self-defense and attempt to preserve Christianity? \n \n And when the Crusades are so often condemned then where is the condemnation of the Muslims for their original aggression? The Crusades (for the most part) were a justified reaction to Muslim aggression.\n \n The Crusades get bad press but few acknowledge that they were a response to Muslim aggression. The first Crusade took place well over 400 years after the Muslims first began attacking Christian lands. \n \n The pre-history of the Crusades is significant. The 1st Crusade was called in part because the Fatimid caliph of Egypt destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and ordered the destruction of all Christian churches. The Muslim army had been aggressively attacking Christian lands for hundreds of years. The Christian lands of Syria, Iraq, the Byzantine Empire, and even as far as Spain and France had been attacked by Muslims. Islam had its origins in \"conversion\" by conquering with Mohammed. Christians had to respond.\n \n Look at this timeline if you have any doubts about the aggressive military endeavors of Islam. The attack on Christian lands by Muslims 400 years prior to the 1st Crusade wasn't the only event. It was the first in a series of events stretching over many, many years.\n \n http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/christian/blchron_xian_crusades01.htm?iam=metaresults&terms=%20prince+arslan",

   "Well, the Catholic church was certainly astray when it was selling indulgences, and torturing heretics, and approving the crusades.\n\n (from a previous thread)\n Firstly, indulgences were not for sell (Canon 2327 excommunicates anyone who seeks material profit from indulgences). Secondly, indulgences did not grant forgiveness. An indulgence is the remission of the debt of temporal punishment (not the eternal punishment) due to sin after its guilt has been forgiven. It is the remission of sentence of penalty and not a commutation of the sentence or penalty. The remission of debt is not the remission of guilt. An indulgence has nothing to do with the guilt of the sin. In fact, an indulgence can only be gained by one who is not in a state of sin; one who has secured forgiveness of his sins by repentance and Confession. This does nothing to detract from the eternal salvation bought for us by Christ on the cross. Even after Christ's sacrifice, we are not exempt from suffering. \n \n Scriptural foundations for indulgences can be found in Matthew 16:19, \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" Jesus gave the Church the power to bind and loose, including the penalty for sin. This is the power the Church uses in granting indulgences. Paul gives us an example of remitting temporal punishment due to sin (as an indulgence does) in 2 Corinthians 2: 6-10 when he allows the man found guilty of sinning with his stepmother (1 Corinthians 5:1) back in to the church after learning of his repentance. There are many more examples in scripture where works can offset the consequences of sin (James 5:20 and 1 Peter 4:8 as well as many Old Testament verses)\n \n Indulgences can also be illustrated with a practical example. Suppose a boy throws a rock through the window of a store to win a bet with his friend (a sin). The boy feels badly after throwing the rock and confesses to the crime with an immediate apology (contrition and confession). The store manager knows the boy and he talks to the owner of the store about the incident. The owner gives the manager the permission to decide whether or not formal charges for vandalism will be pressed. The manager elects not to press charges for the indiscretion (forgiveness). However, he still has a broken window to repair (consequence of sin). He decides to let the boy work off the debt at the store by sweeping for 5 days. The boy comes in every day for 4 days on time. The boy has a very good attitude during his work. He actually helps the storeowner stock shelves and cleans out the freezer without the storeowner requiring it of him (good works/penance). Because the boy has shown a change of heart and reformed his ways the store manager cancels the debt of the remaining day (an indulgence). In effect the boy gets time off for good behavior. This does not change the fact that the boy sinned, nor is the sin abolished. Rather, the good works lessen the penalty of that sin. \n \n Again, I acknowledge that there were also abuses concerning indulgences in the time of Luther but the Church never sanctioned this. Indulgences were granted to those who would give alms towards the building of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. These people gave alms for a good work. Just as Christ gave a special blessing to the widow who gave her mite as an alm to the temple in Jerusalem, indulgences were granted to those who gave alms for St. Peter's.",

The fact that they had invaded and conquered without just cause, in itself, defeats that statement.\n\n \n And the Spanish invaded and conquered the natives in South America and northward without just cause. \n \n \nmaximus: They [the Muslims] were occupiers of a land that was not theirs, one they had overtaken by violence.\n\n \n And the Spanish were occupiers of a land that was not theirs, one they had overtaken by violence.",
