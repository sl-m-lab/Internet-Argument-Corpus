By your definition, all the elections in the past 20 years have been bad. If you are going to the voting booth and saying: \"well, X is a piece of ####, but he's not as bad as Y, so I'll vote for X\", then you should not be voting. People that go to the ballot box and pick the lesser of 2 evils are a large part of what is wrong with American politics. Have the self respect to demand something better.",
