Men and women DO SERVE together in the military, and the standards that apply to them can easily be applied to gays as well.\n\n \n Thank you, i was going to post a much more terse response but I refrained.\n \n One thing that many straight men overlook is that gay people pick from the same pool of people their friends AND lovers. Gay men had to learn from an early age to deal with \"the men they'll never have.\" Straight men seem to have a much bigger problem with this. IMO, it comes down to whether or not straight men are comfortable with their own sexuality. I have several straight, male friends. We shower at the gym after workouts or we have an afternoon, ocassionally, at the sauna together (cultural thing here in Germany). They're totally cool with me, as I with them. They're actually more affectionate to me than I am to them. But there's no \"sexual\" attraction for any of us.\n \n Another thing, I think it's more common for gay men to be friends with their ex's than it is in the heterosexual world. We've been learning to move on and detach our whole lives. This whole \"sex\" thing is more the hangup of unevolved heterosexual men. IMO. I don't see the problem as prevelant in europe as I see it in the states. I think it's fundamentalist-religion damage. \n \n Another argument to this is... two straight men can develop a very intense emotional bond in these extreme circumstances. If they're all in a foxhole under fire... who are these two men thinking about first? Again, this poster is relegating everything down to \"sex.\" He naively thinks that two straight men cannot have an intense bond. It's all just about dropping soap in showers and who's looking at my butt. Kind of sad, actually.",

We're men.\n \n \nIs it reasonable for a heterosexual to want to avoid close contact with a homosexual under certain conditions? Like being naked for example? There are gays that go to my gym, am I being homophobic if I purposely avoid showering with him?\n\n \n That's your problem, not the homosexual's problem. Homophobic? Well, in a way. I think in the most rudimentary definition, fear of homosexuals, then yes. From your few posts, I don't think you're prejudiced against homosexuals, just not informed. You're making decisions based on your misinformation. But it's the discomfort thing you need to figure out. As I said... a gay man is not going to wait for you to drop the soap. \n \n I live in Germany and here there is the \"sauna\" culture. Men and women, straight or gay, take sauna's, whirpools, damp sauna's together in the nude. Do you think every straight man is looking at all the naked breasts bouncing around? NO. Do you think all the gay men are looking at all the male genitalia flopping around? NO. Pretty much every gym here has a coed sauna in it. And the sauna's are used ALL the time. It's not about sex. This is where I think American culture is so strange. People try to sue Janet Jackson for flashing a boob for 2 seconds on TV. Nude sunbathing is considered immoral and is outlawed. The puritanical stupidity that has plagued the US all these years needs to stop sometime. You think 'dem darned gays are looking at my wee wee in the shower! I seriously doubt it. And IF someone looks, who cares? Straight guys check each other out all the time..... doesn't mean they want to have sex.\n \n \nI can surely pick my friends; naturally my interests would hardly mirror a homosexual's interests. Some are even quite feminine and would hardly be interested in the same subjects as me. Is it reasonable for me to be selective about whom my friends can be?\n\n \n I have no clue what that is suppose to mean. Do you think that gays don't have the same interests as straights? I have gay friends that are into fixing old cars, die hard football fanatics, Opera fanatics, fishing fantatics.... I mean... what do you think our \"interests\" are? Some homosexuals are feminine acting.... but, in my personal world, they are the exception to the rule. But I don't judge anyone for lisping. I think it's cool. We're all of God's creatures. Who am I to judge?\n \n You can be as selective as you want. But, if I only associated with gay, white men, my life would be not so rich. If I only associated with gays, what kind of life would that be? My best friend in the world is a married straight man and I'm godfather to his 3 children. I love this man dearly and why would I not be his friend ? because he is straight?\n \n If you met me, I would not fit into the stereotypical \"homosexual\" personae that you think you know about. I'm a black belt in tae kwon do. 6'1, 230pounds and kind of look like a vin diesel's older brother. When I go out with my straight friends, women hit on me.... guess it's a daddy thing or something. I'm into a lot of sports... Love keeping fit. Been learning how to play soccer with some of my neighbors here. It's been fun. Homosexuals are normal people... have varying interests. I actually even tried hunting last year. I didn't like it.\n \n I only tell you this to break down some stereotypes you're harboring. So, what is about me that you would not want to associate with?",

   "I can see your point, though I am confused about gay sex drive, your saying a gay man's sex drive is not feminine??\n\n Well, since we are talking about a gay man, I would guess it would most likely be masculine.\n \n \n\n Is it reasonable for a heterosexual to want to avoid close contact with a homosexual under certain conditions? Like being naked for example? There are gays that go to my gym, am I being homophobic if I purposely avoid showering with him?\n\n Yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. Why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? They're not going to do anything to you. If you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia.\n \n \n\n I can surely pick my friends; naturally my interests would hardly mirror a homosexual's interests. Some are even quite feminine and would hardly be interested in the same subjects as me. Is it reasonable for me to be selective about whom my friends can be?\n\n Gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. Their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. They are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. Gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. So while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice.",

   "\n The whole concept confuses me. If you want to be with a man then you think as a woman so you're with another man that wants to be a woman and what's that mean? You have two men that want to be women? How on earth does that work?? Not a clue here. You can't have a man that wants a woman, you're not a woman. You can only have a man that wants a man. Well if you want to be a woman and your mate wants a man, how is your relationship any benefit? The concept seems to be an endless loop that loses me at the beginning. .\n\n \n Now there is strong evidence that you are terminally confused! Homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex. Just think of it that way and all will be clear. There is no need for a male homsexual to think as a female in any way. Nor a female homosexual to think as a male. Perhaps you are confusing transgender effects with homosexuality - they are quite different.",

Orientation is only going to be an issue if someone intends to talk about it. \n\n What kind of conversations do you have Jyoshu in real life?\n Cause my conversations include stuff like \"What did you do last week-end?\"\n \"Well, me and the Mrs went and saw the new Steve Carrell flick\"\n \n It includes me going to the office / cubicle of my co-workers, and seeing pictures of their kids, or their wives, or .... in their cubes. Come to think of it, I think at least half of them have those types of pictures in their work areas.\n \n I've been in the military jyoshu, and when you're stuck under water for weeks on end, you DO talk about a lot of things, including people's sexual orientation because it IS a part of their lives.\n I don't think some people get the type of special privilege they advocate for yourself. Whereby they DO talk about their personal lives and the thing important in it, including sexuality, and then insist that gays should just keep their mouths shut and it's not a big deal to request them to be silent.\n \n \n \nActually, this is an excellent example of what I'm talking about. If a person who doesn't have a girlfriend is asked whether or not they have a girlfriend, the answer is ... well, 'no'. It really doesn't matter if they are straight or gay--either way they don't have a girlfriend and the answer is the same. There is absolutely no reason for them to need to say \"no, because I'm gay\" any more than a straight person saying \"no, but I'm straight, though!\". The only reason a person would want to add the 'I'm gay/straight' part is if they are intending to make that an issue. And I just don't see the point in that.\n\n That is a possibility people can choose.\n It is a SENSICAL one?\n \n Let me ask you Jyoshu, if I asked you if you have a boy-friend, would your first inclination be to just say \"No\"?\n Would it be just \"No\" and that's it with no added commentary?\n \n \n \nThough you clearly want to and want it to be the most important thing in your life.\n Sexuality doesn't have to be an issue in the military at all. In fact, I'd just as soon they focus on their job instead. I don't go to work everyday with a sign that says \"I'm straight\" or \"I'm attracted to women.\" Nor do I advertise it. Why should gay people feel they need to do that concerning their orientation?\n\n And in parade the false arguments.\n Jyoshu, there is a HUGE difference inbetween being able to simply acknowledge that something IS a part of your life, and making it the center-piece.\n \n In all your time at work, does ANYBODY know if you are gay or straight?\n You try to make it sound like we're whining because we can't come in on the first day at the job, stand on the desk and announce loudly \"I am gay!\". Trying to pretend \"Well, I don't do that, so ....\"\n \n When the truth is this is about simple acknowledgement of WHO WE ARE in daily conversations that play out over the weeks, months, and years that we are employed at a company.\n \n If people at your work KNOW that you are STRAIGHT, then quite frankly you have lost this argument.",

Some do throw their sexuality around and I think sets a bad example for everyone. Personally, I have never found sex with someone I do not love to have much meaning. Its like borrowing a car you'd never want to own or never get to own. It really hollow. The conversations and common interests die with the urge. \n \n I can count on one hand the number of women I have slept with, and I think that was too many really. I am not a prude, where there is genuine mutual attraction there can be Intimacy but safety first. I can't think of anything harder than two people with real affection making limits. Very smart thing to do though, and the best way to do it is to control where you hang out together.",

Our sexuality is part of what makes us human and to repress that even in public is to deny that vital part of Human nature.\n\n \n The Janet debacle was hysterical. I remember reading a newspaper article where some southern christian woman sued J Jackson because JJ \"shocked\" and \"insulted\" her religion. The case was thrown out.\n \n Also, I was flipping through the channels yesterday afternoon and there was a medical program on TV. (Public telelvision. Everyone gets this basic service in germany.) There was a topless hausfrau receiving a breast examination from a doctor. It was on one of the major stations. It just isn't a big deal in Europe. I think the US culture has made people so ashamed of their bodies. Everyone has breasts, butts and sexual organs. Many cultures are taught to pretend they do not exist. \n \n That being said, yes, I agree that we should not hide our sexuality; however, excessive groping in a public place is inappropriate no matter who it is. But, it's primarily done by the hetero's. I'm not sure I've ever seen any gays \"grope\" each other in a blatently public place that was not primarily gay. And I've lived in New York City, LA, San Fran and now Cologne. All incredibly liberal bastians of sexual freedom. But the problem I have is that many hets think we're \"flaunting\" our sexuality if we even hold our partners' hands! I am more uncomfortable holding a man's hand outside one of the gay ghetto's in the above-mentioned metropolis' in the US than I am in most of Germany, Netherlands, France, Spain, Great Brittian and Belgium, Sweden and Denmark.... let alone ALL of Canada. When I'm in public, holding my man's hand, I'm not thinking about... \"Let's show everyone we're gay!\" It just seems natural... I'm following the natural law of my body... a natural expression of my affection.\n \n I think the whole DADT thing is just that most guys were taught to think of \"ick\" when they think of two men holdings hands. It's nothing but the immature \"ick\" factor that was bestowed on them by religious wingnuts and a homophobic, rightist media. IMO. But what do I know, I'm just an opera singer.",

   "It looks like with the U.S. engagin both Iraq and Afghanistan they are conveniently turning a blind eye to gay soldiers. The policy seems to change as it suits the government. \n \n http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iusf0qzmyeUxdw-9g2DKh42LzkNwD8U21P1O0\n \n \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Even if no one is asking, Army Sgt. Darren Manzella has been telling anyone who'll listen that he's gay - without serious retribution so far from the military. Manzella, a medic who served in Iraq and Kuwait, has acknowledged his sexual orientation in national media interviews and again on Tuesday in a Washington news conference.\n \n \"This is who I am. This is my life,\" said Manzella, who received a combat medical badge for his service in Iraq. \"It has never affected my job performance before. I don't think it will make a difference now. And to be honest since then, I don't see a difference because of my homosexuality.\"\n \n Aubrey Sarvis, executive director of Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, said Manzella's case demonstrates the military is arbitrarily enforcing its \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy now that the country is at war.\n \n The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy prohibits active-duty service members from openly acknowledging whether they are gay or lesbian.\n \n Manzella still could be investigated now that he has left the battlefield. Every time he has said he is gay publicly can be counted as a violation of the policy, one of his attorneys said.\n \n Manzella first told a military supervisor about his sexual orientation in August 2006 while he was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, and working in division headquarters. Three weeks after Manzella made the revelation, his battalion commander told him an investigation had been closed without finding \"proof of homosexuality.\"\n \n A month later, Manzella was redeployed for the war in Iraq.\n \n Paul Boyce Jr., an Army spokesman, said he was unaware of an investigation of Manzella being opened or closed. He said the investigation would have been done by Manzella's Fort Hood unit, and officials there are on leave and unavailable to discuss the case.\n \n \"This particular soldier's unit only recently returned from the war to Fort Hood, Texas, so it's premature to speculate on any future actions until the young man's situation can be considered by his chain of command,\" Boyce said in a statement.\n \n Manzella, originally from Portland, N.Y., returned from the Middle East last month and went on leave shortly before Christmas. He will return to the 1st Cavalry Division at Ford Hood at the end of the month.\n \n A bill to eliminate the military's sexual orientation policy, filed by Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., is pending in Congress. Sarvis said the bill is unlikely to get out of committee during this election year, but hearings could be held.\n \n Elaine Donnelly, president of the Center for Military Readiness, said Manzella's commanders should have discharged him when they learned he was gay. Her group opposes allowing gays to join the military.\n",

Obviously, gays CAN do the job, otherwise we would be kicked out just on ground of incapability.\n The arguments for gay inclusion are numerous.\n The federal government has done at least two separate studies showing gays can serve in the military without detriment.\n NUMEROUS other \"modern\" countries' militaries allow gays to openly serve.\n And then there is the issue of how our government ignores its own policy out of convenience...\n \n If it's an issue of \"can't afford\", maybe we should be questioning why the military is allowed to \"afford\" a policy that is purely an example of prejudicial discrimination in peace-time.",

   "I don't think anyone should be prevented from serving their country. Gays are not 2nd class citizens and are no different than straight people. It's not my place (or anyones) to decide someone's capabilities based on sexual orientation. I also have a very big problem with the idea of \"you can be gay, I just don't want to know or hear about it\". Gays deserve to be able to talk about their relationships and issues, without being told they are jumping up and down proclaiming they're shouting it from the rooftops and trying to shove it down peoples throats. When you're in the military, you develop close bonds, you talk about your lives. Why should gays be deprived of something that seems so simple? \n \n Imagine for a second, the whole world were gay except maybe 8-10%. Say it was an oppressive society too. And gay people said to you straight people. I know you like the opposite sex, but I want you never EVER to express that. \" In that world, you wouldn't have a lot of role models on tv, in fact, you would see gay couples flaunting their sexuality. But everyone tells you, it's not okay for you. How would that make YOU feel? Would you not feel dehumanized????\n \n Ok, so it's a feeling of discomfort you get when someone says \"I'm gay!\". Perhaps you should examine WITHIN you WHY it makes you feel uncomfortable. Ponder for a second what about it makes you feel uneasy before pointing the finger outward. Examine what it is and think, \"what if I have issues with my own sexuality and not them?\" Just try it. Chances are, it is with you the problem lies. get to know some gay people as people so you can have an open mind. Maybe it will change your perception. Chances are you know some, who haven't made it apparent to you because of your blatant bigotry.\n \n Remember, when you point the finger at someone, there are 3 pointing back at you.",
