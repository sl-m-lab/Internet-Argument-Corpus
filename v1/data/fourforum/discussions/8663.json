   "Rhea County voters toss out commissioners who wanted to criminalize homosexuality\n \n Voters in Rhea County have elected five new people to the County Commission and say a short-lived request for a ban on homosexualty was only one issue in the change. \n \n People who live in the Dayton area say overcrowded schools and how the county is handling growth also drove the election on Thursday. \n \n Voters turned out incumbents Harold Fisher, Tom Davis and R. Paul Tallent. Incumbents Dennis Tumlin Brad Varner didn't seek re-election. Four incumbents were returned by voters. \n \n Fisher had been a commissioner for 20 years and was chairman of the body. \n \n In March 2004, commission members voted unanimously voted to ask state lawmakers to introduce legislation amending Tennessee's criminal code so the county could charge homosexuals with crimes against nature. \n \n Two days later, they rescinded the vote, saying they didn't understand they were voting to ban homosexuality in the county. \n \n Newly-elected member Bill Hollin says some constituents thought the gay ban wasn't as bad as the commissioners not understanding what they had voted to do. \n http://www.wbir.com/news/regional/story.aspx?storyid=36708",

   "Anti-gay rights group gives up\n Lack of signatures will keep referendum off ballot\n BY DAN KLEPAL | ENQUIRER STAFF WRITER\n Gay people will soon be protected against discrimination in the city of Cincinnati, for the first time since 1992.\n \n Equal Rights Not Special Rights, a group involved in a petition drive to force a referendum on whether gays should be protected against discrimination in employment and housing under the city's Human Rights Ordinance, withdrew its petitions Tuesday and requested that the referendum not be placed on the ballot in November, or in any future election.\n \n That decision ends a 14-year battle over whether gays should be protected as a class of people - a fight that caused Cincinnati to be viewed by many people around the country as intolerant.\n \n \n \"This shows how much the city has changed,\" said Gary Wright, co-chairman of a group called Citizens to Restore Fairness, which is in favor of protecting gays. \"This is a very important victory and is exactly the outcome we were looking for.\"\n \n Phil Burress, chairman of Equal Rights Not Special Rights, said he made the decision Tuesday after it became obvious that many signatures on the petitions were forgeries. His group had collected just two signatures more than the minimum 7,654 needed to force the referendum. A hearing was scheduled at the Board of Elections on Thursday, where more than 1,300 of those signatures were to be challenged as forgeries, or as being improperly altered by paid signature gatherers.\n \n The list of signatures to be challenged included Cuban President Fidel Castro, Reds owner Bob Castellini, former Hamilton County Commissioner Bob Bedinghaus and Enquirer reporter Greg Korte. Bedinghaus and Korte denied signing the petitions.\n \n \"Our own investigation revealed one person forged some names,\" Burress said. \"It was quite obvious. So we immediately said, that's not right. It's a shame it went on this long, but we're sorry the people aren't going to be permitted to vote in this issue.\"\n \n Jennifer Branch says that's hogwash.\n \n Branch, an attorney for Citizens to Restore Fairness, said the fraud was systematic.\n \n \"There were 1,300 reasons why those petitions were not going to be good enough,\" Branch said.\n \n Gay people were briefly protected when the ordinance was passed by City Council in 1992. It bars discrimination on the basis of race, religion, handicapped status, gender, Appalachian origin and sexual orientation.\n \n The next year, voters passed Article XII, which prohibited city government from treating sexual orientation as a protected class - thus removing protections afforded to gay people.\n \n Voters repealed Article XII in 2004, allowing council to put gays back on the list of protected people. In March, council voted 8-1 to do so; only council member Chris Monzel voted against it. The law had not taken effect, however, while the referendum effort was under way.\n \n Council member David Crowley led the effort to add gays to the ordinance. He was thrilled with the outcome Tuesday night.\n \n \"What surprises me is that Burress and whoever else is in charge knew they had seriously flawed petitions, yet they took it this far,\" Crowley said. \"It's such a waste of taxpayer money and time.\"\n http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006608160412",

   "State GOP suddenly dumps newly hired evangelical lobbyist\n \n \n Ben Lopez, the chief lobbyist and spokesman for the Traditional Values Coalition -- the Anaheim-based evangelical advocacy group led by the controversial Rev. Lou Sheldon -- has been fired from his new job as an outreach worker with the California Republican Party, sources said Tuesday. \n \n Lopez's hiring had been hailed by conservatives, who have been concerned about Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's moves to the political center, when it was made public late last week as the state Republican Party opened its convention. \n \n But gay and lesbian groups criticized the decision by the state Republicans to add Lopez, a well-known evangelical advocate, to the party's payroll and called on Schwarzenegger to renounce Lopez and Sheldon as intolerant. \n \n Mike Spence, who heads the conservative California Republican Assembly, said the decision to dump Lopez brings \"frustration that the governor's organization is not about the whole team effort. We're supposed to be unified behind the governor's staff like (Democrat) Susan Kennedy, and yet they fired the only person who could do church outreach.\" \n \n The hiring was seen as a move aimed specifically to shore up the governor's re-election support among evangelicals, who are a key voting group for state Republicans. \n \n Patrick Dorinson, the California Republican Party communications director, rejected that characterization, saying Tuesday that Lopez's work \"was through the convention, and that work is now completed.\" \n \n Yet on Sunday, Dorinson had given no indication that Lopez's job with the party would end. \n \n Dorinson on Sunday said only that Lopez was \"not authorized to be a media spokesperson\" for the GOP and would not be permitted to talk to the press in an official capacity. \n \n Lopez could not be reached Tuesday for comment, but sources said he was informed of the termination and \"given different reasons\" for it. \n \n Sheldon founded the Traditional Values Coalition in 1980. It has been described as one of the nation's most active evangelical lobbying groups -- and one that critics say has pushed anti-gay activities while fighting what Sheldon has called \"the homosexual agenda.\" \n \n Still, Sheldon has been tapped by insiders from Bush adviser Karl Rove to Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman, to advise politicians on ways to reach evangelicals. \n \n Lopez, reached Sunday by The Chronicle, didn't appear to know that his work was to end at the close of the convention. Indeed, he said he would be happy to discuss his hiring and his upcoming political work, but had been instructed to direct any press calls to \"the governor's campaign press office. ... That's the orders I'm under.\" \n \n Katie Levinson, spokeswoman for the Schwarzenegger campaign, said Lopez was not an employee of the governor's re-election campaign. \n \n California Republican Party Chairman Duf Sundheim said during the weekend that Lopez was one of more than 70 consultants helping the party talk to voter groups such as single mothers and Latinos. \n \n \"It is no different than any other outreach,\" Sundheim said.\n http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/23/BAGF5KNFKK1.DTL",
