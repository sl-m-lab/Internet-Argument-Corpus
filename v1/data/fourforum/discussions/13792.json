   "Actually guys, I looked into this last July when the Eddie Eagle-North Korea argument was made. I went to the Brady Campaign website to see what was being said about Eddie Eagle. I found archived articles where the BC had trashed EE as ineffective. \n \n That didn&#8217;t surprise me.\n \n What did surprise me, however, was that I found the BC had coped, almost word for word, the Eddie Eagle message when it created its own child safety program. The program was called &#8220;STOP 2 A Day in the Neighborhood,&#8221; and it was based on a video game.\n \n Here, for example, it the EE message:\n \n If you see a gun: STOP! Don't Touch. Leave the Area. Tell an Adult. \n \n Here is the Brady Campaign &#8220;STOP 2 A Day in the Neighborhood&#8221; message:\n \n You will learn that the best decisions to make when a gun is in your environment is first, not to touch it; secondly, get out of the area where the gun is; and thirdly, tell an adult/authority about the gun. These skills will help you to make smart, wise, and safe choices both in the game and in real life.\n \n Sara Brady drank the sweet, sweet Kool-Aid.\n \n BUT, I went back before I posted this to look at the BC program again and it&#8217;s gone. The BC has redone their entire website and the &#8220;STOP 2 A Day in the Neighborhood&#8221; program has disappeared without a trace or even an acknowledgment from the BC website. If you click the link I originally provided below (in the old post) you are simply redirected to another web page at the BC site. It is as if the BC wanted to erase all existence of the program, and do so as completely and utterly as anything Winston Smith ever put down a memory hole in his cubicle at the Ministry of Truth building. \n \n However, you can still find traces of the existence of the BC&#8217;s &#8220;Stop 2&#8221; program on the web if you google &#8220;Stop 2 a day in the neighborhood&#8221;&#8212;when the BC purged all mention of the program from its website it forgot to delete the page where you can attempt to order the program on CD, for example.\n \n Here is one of my two original posts on the existence of the Brady Campaign&#8217;s hypocritical cloning of Eddie Eagle: \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/12966-chilling-resemblance-between-north-korean-indoctrination-eddie-eagle-program-3.html#post360128\n \n \n If &#8220;Eddie Eagle&#8221; is an ineffective program with the real, hidden agenda of promoting gun ownership, then why did the Brady Campaign adopt the program&#8217;s message nearly word for word? \n \n Here is &#8220;Eddie Eagle&#8221; again (http://www.nrahq.org/safety/eddie/): \n \n &#8220;The Eddie Eagle GunSafe\u00ae Program teaches children in pre-K through third grade four important steps to take if they find a gun. These steps are presented by the program's mascot, Eddie Eagle\u00ae, in an easy-to-remember format consisting of the following simple rules:\n \n If you see a gun: STOP! Don't Touch. Leave the Area. Tell an Adult. \n \n [bold emphasis in original]\n \n Now see the plagiarism of the &#8220;Eddie Eagle&#8221; message in the new Brady Campaign video game http://bradycenter.org/stop2/\n \n Check out the launch of the new children and teens interactive gun prevention game! The STOP 2 program provides this virtual game that teaches and reinforces simple steps and skills to implement if children and/or teens find themselves in a situation involving a gun.\n \n The user learns to make safe, smart, healthy, life-saving decisions through five potential scenarios involving guns. The player is rewarded for making the right decisions by earning arcade tokens to play later in up to five mini-games at the arcade. The game changes each time it is played depending on the dialogue choices made by the player.\n \n Be sure to read the parent and teacher prologue to assist you in using the game as educational tool for single or group players.\n \n From the \"parent a teacher prologue\":\n \n Teaching Moments\n Parents and teachers can use this interactive game as an opportunity to instruct and role play with children and teens, by first helping students realize that they can indeed make a choice in any situation, thus empowering them to make the safe choices to never touch a gun, to leave the area/situation immediately and tell an adult and/or authority about the presence of a gun. Teachers and parents can involve an individual or small groups to play the game, pausing to discuss the consequences of available choices and relating them to wise, safe, and healthy decisions and outcomes. \n \n From the game launch window itself:\n \n &#8220;A Day in the Neighborhood&#8221; is a virtual adventure game. The game will take you through real life situations involving firearms where you must make tough, and possibly life altering choices. Like real life, this game is full of choices. You will learn that the best decisions to make when a gun is in your environment is first, not to touch it; secondly, get out of the area where the gun is; and thirdly, tell an adult/authority about the gun. These skills will help you to make smart, wise, and safe choices both in the game and in real life. \n",
