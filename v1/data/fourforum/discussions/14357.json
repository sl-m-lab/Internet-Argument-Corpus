   "I accidentally posted this thread in the environment forum and didn't realize about it until now. Hopefully the admin will delete that thread. My bad. emoticon_emb\n ______________________________________________________________________________________\n Mallcore\" is an umbrella term used to refer to nu-metal, melodic Metalcore, and melodic Deathcore (as a somewhat traditional Metalhead, I think all those genres suck, IMO.) \"Mallcore\" could refer to Glam Metal (an oxymoron, IMO) and Gothic Metal bands, but it normally refers to bands that have more of a \"core\" sound. I was sitting at this computer desk recently when a thought came to my mind and I found out what the term \"mallcore\" actually means.\n \n Mallcore is a combination of the terms \"mall\" and \"core.\" Most bands that play a genre with the term \"core\" at the end (e.g. Metalcore, Hardcore, Deathcore, and I think nu-metal should also have a name with \"core\" at the end) are disliked by traditional and NBM Metalheads partially because a lot of the musicians are scenesters who seem to have no understanding of metal culture or ideology, but mainly because they water down their music's heaviness in order to sell more albums. Selling a lot of albums isn't bad in and of itself, but the heaviness of the music must not be compromised in order to do so. That doesn't mean that ultra-chaotic forms of Noisegrind are the only acceptable Metal music, but there's a line between playing melodic music and selling out.\n \n \"Mall-core\" is insulting because traditionally, Metalhands are supposed to be anti-commercial and anti-fashion. While a lot of Metalheads might try just a bit too hard to look Metal, some of the greatest Metal musicians (e.g. Chuck Schuldiner, Scott Hull, Chris Barnes) never tried very hard to look Metal, yet they've left a permanent mark on Extreme Metal without all the \"Look at me everyone, I'm a hardcore Metalhead!\" Thus, to be said to have anything to do with trendiness, commercialism, or malls is considered an insult in Metal.",
