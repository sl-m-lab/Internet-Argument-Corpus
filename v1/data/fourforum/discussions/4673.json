   "Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion. [1 Timothy 1.7]\n\n St. Augustine of Hippo (A.D. 354-430), De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim\n But you should keep in mind that Augustine lived before the dawn of modern science. What he thought of as science was less like what we know as science today and more like what creationists view as science. Nevertheless, sometimes he was right, sometimes wrong.",

   "Your contempt is slightly misguided. Look to Augustine's god. Augustine is only attempting to emulate him, trying to punish you for the apple core in your hand.\nSoooo, I bear the stigmata of Eve because I am female?\n \n Oh, by the way, let's take a look at the actual Bible verse:\n \n Genesis 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\n \n I do hope that the King James version of the Bible is not too difficult for you to follow.\n \n OK, what is meant by \"the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\" Does seeking out scientific knowledge have any bearing on the meaning of \"good and evil.\" Is that is what is sought in scientific inquiry?\n \n \"Knowledge of good and evil\" refers to morality, understanding what moral behavior is, meaning that one must refer to the knowledge of God for guidance in this matter. God has very kindly provided the Ten Commandments as a guide, not to mention providing frequent additional directives throughout the texts of the Old and New Testaments.\n \n I think that these additional directives give sufficient evidence that God's \"good and evil\" does not refer to determining the structure of the atom, all of the scientific knowledge that humankind has amassed. Surely, if this had been God's intent, he would have encoded the structure of the atom within the texts of the aforementioned Testaments for our guidance, as well as all of the other scientific knowledge needed for humankind to flourish.",
