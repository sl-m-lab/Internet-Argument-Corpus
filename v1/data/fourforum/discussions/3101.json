   "The Smoking Gun: Matthew 21:5 \n \n \nbillsco says: Bible scholars point out a glaring error in the book of Matthew which strongly indicates to me that the author was not an eyewitness to any of Jesus' ministry as is historically claimed, \n \n \n Your remark that Bible scholars are pointing to anything appears most inaccurate, especially over any words in Matthew 21:5. Some wish to discredit the Bible by pointing out things in which they do not understand. Your descriptions above place words of scholars against historical claims, but offer no references. These are statements of generalities that prove nothing, except that you personally believe there is a problem. \n \n \nYou continue: but rather was some unknown scribe copying large sections of the Book of Mark-the oldest of the four gospels-\n\n \n If four of us followed Bill Gates around and gave 28 chapters on events pertaining to his life, over the next three years, then some parts would be the same, while others would be quite different. Suppose that 100 of us took on the task of detailing those accounts in sequential order, so that others could know the story of just how great this Bill Gates guy was in our day. Then, thirty of forty years later, a group of men gathered to decide take just 4 of them to include in their overall work on 'The Bill Gates Chronicles.' Do you suppose that those men would select four books that stated the exact same things? Or, would they take four accounts that complemented one another to paint a broader picture of things? Your argument above does not hold water, because too much of Mark is duplicated in Matthew. If Matthew's account is to be tossed out, then so must well over half of Mark. \n \n \nYou continue : -and simply creating new details to make it appear Old Testament prophesies had been fulfilled. This is a particularly fatal flaw, IMO, since it removes the author of the book of Matthew as a credible witness. Further, since neither Mark nor Luke were chosen disciples--we frankly don't know who they were\n\n \n Both Mark and Luke were travel companions of the Apostle Paul during his travels throughout the area. Mark was the cousin of Barnabas, who Paul takes with him in Acts 15:37, 39. Also see Mark in Acts 12:12, 25. Paul mentions Mark in Colossians 4:10. Luke is Paul's 'beloved physician' of Colossians 4:14. He is believed to have written the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts. Those two accounts contain the only uses of several Greek words in the New Testament containing root words used by physicians in that era. The fact is that Paul and his travel companions wrote well over half of the New Testament. According to all accounts, Paul, Luke or Mark never met Jesus of Nazareth in person. However, Paul and Luke had more education and professional training that all the other New Testament writers combined. \n \n Most of the common people 2000 years ago could not read or write in Greek or any other language. If they had a story to tell, then they would seek out an educated person like Luke or Paul to write their story. Since Luke was Paul's personal physician, then he had opportunity to run across many people who actually walked with Jesus. When you couple that with his abilities, then he becomes the best candidate to write the Gospel of Luke.\n \n \nYou continue: they thus relate a story which is at best third party, and the entire affair becomes very indistinct and problematic. The three synoptic gospels can rightly be open for probing criticism and honest doubt. If extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, the synoptic gospels have stepped further back from that burden of proof.\n\n \n These are common excuses given by unbelievers. They fail to realize that the principal writer of the Holy Text is the Holy Spirit that inspired the men to write, and not the men themselves. Also, it is written in such a way that unbelievers will never believe it, and the children of God will be fed by it at the same time. The Bible says, \"But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is {a matter} of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.\" 2Peter 1:20+21.\n \n \nYour smoking gun: In actual fact, the prophecy that Matthew quoted only refers to one animal:\n\n \n This is one of the easiest seeming contradictions to solve. Here is the New American Standard Bible translation. Matt 21:5 \"SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, 'BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.'\"\n \n \"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold your King is coming to you, gentle, and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.\" Matt. 21:5 [See Isaiah 62:11 and Zechariah 9:9]. There are not two donkeys here, but just one. The prophecy was very precise to say that the animal would not be just a mere donkey, but the colt of a donkey. How did God send the true King of Heaven into Jerusalem? Satan would have sent a legion, and an army, and a thousand Arabian stallions with chariots of gold. God sent His Son on a half grown donkey. So you are hung up on the fact that the Text says \"on a donkey, EVEN on a colt, the foal . . .\" Since you believe that to be two beasts, and have this huge problem to solve, then God's Word must be in error, and we are to toss out the entire Gospel of Matthew. \n \n The Bible has withstood the test of time from skeptics for the past 2000 years. In every case the seeming contradiction is created in the mind of the unbeliever. That is plenty of reason for him to discredit the validity of the Bible, but no reason for any believer to do the same. Next time at least qualify your statements by finding out who the main characters like Mark and Luke really are in reference to what the Bible says. \n \n Regards,\n \n Elijah",

   "Welcome back, terral03! It's nice to see you back here in your latest incarnation as Elijah. Wasn't Elijah the guy who took that fantastic chariot ride? You know, the one who slipped the surly bonds of earth, and flew off into lala land? Very apropos handle I must say. \n \n \n\n Your descriptions above place words of scholars against historical claims, but offer no references. \n\n \n \n Of course, how wrong of me not to credit my sources when I mentioned biblical scholars in my opening sentence. Especially since your rebuttal was full of accreditation. Who were your sources again? You will be providing proof from biblical scholars that Mark and Luke, the ones whose names are associated with the synoptic gospels, were one and the same and also companions to Paul in a later post, I assume? \n \n We learned a short time ago that odds of an ossuary bearing the inscription, \"James, the son of Joseph, brother of Jesus\" being the famous biblical characters were quite slim since those names were very common in antiquity and thus could be merely coincidental. Much more so with a single name like Luke. \"Mark\" is even more specious.\n \n For an expert biblical scholar, I would like to quote Richard Carrier, and include a brief excerpt from his work entitled, \"Why I Don't Buy the Resurrection Story.\"\n \n http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/resurrection/3k.html\n \n Occupation: Instructor of Ancient History, Graduate Student Fellow, Librarian's Assistant\n Degrees:\n \u0095 B.A. History (minor in Classical Civilization), UC Berkeley (1997) \n \u0095 M.A. Ancient History, Columbia University (1998) \n \u0095 M.Phil. Ancient History, Columbia University (2000) \n \n \n Quote: \n \"Luke's being a doctor is also merely a supposition. It can certainly be disputed. The physician companion of Paul may not be the author of Acts or the gospel attributed to him. We have no evidence, in fact, that he was. It was merely presumed by others, a century later. Luke doesn't sign either book, much less tell us his profession. His accounts are less fabulous, and thus show signs of an educated seriousness lacking in the other gospels, but these works display no details that would require him to have had an actual medical education. So we cannot know if he was a doctor. \n One might argue that there is then no basis for disputing the notion that the author of Luke was a doctor, but if it were sensible to believe everything that we have \"no basis for disputing\" we would have a lot of very odd beliefs. Why, by that reasoning, Alexander the Great was a sausage seller and an acrobat, and a magician on Wednesdays. But we have positive reasons to doubt that Luke, the author, was Paul's companion, \"Luke the doctor.\" First of all, Luke the author tells us the wrong stories about Paul's conversion, and gets many of Paul's ethical opinions wrong. His companion would not likely have made such mistakes. Luke also explains insanity as the product of demons, a very unmedical opinion of the matter, certainly showing that Luke was not a member of the Methodists or Empiricists, the only two schools of medicine with rational views about the world. Thus, if Luke was a doctor, he was a superstitious one, and no more reliable a witness to fact than any other superstitious man of his age.\"\n \n You are basing your claim that Luke was a companion of Paul on a supposition over a century removed from the fact. And again, I find your lack of credible experts to support your contention very telling. Not to mention the speciousness of who Mark was and the utter commonality of that name.\n \n \n\n If four of us followed Bill Gates around and gave 28 chapters on events pertaining to his life, over the next three years, then some parts would be the same, while others would be quite different. Suppose that 100 of us took on the task of detailing those accounts in sequential order, so that others could know the story of just how great this Bill Gates guy was in our day. Then, thirty of forty years later, a group of men gathered to decide take just 4 of them to include in their overall work on 'The Bill Gates Chronicles.' Do you suppose that those men would select four books that stated the exact same things? Or, would they take four accounts that complemented one another to paint a broader picture of things? \n\n \n \n Bill Gates has not performed any miracles which require extraordinary proof for extraordinary claims. Bill Gates is a person whose history is known to millions without 100 of us (whatever you mean by that) needing to detail his life. But most importantly, you are way off on your timeline if you are suggesting Jesus' work was chronicled and standardized within 30-40 years of his lifetime, and that the works complement each other. I don't know what to make of your above statement; it is so far off the mark in all regards.\n \n \n\n \n This is one of the easiest seeming contradictions to solve. Here is the New American Standard Bible translation. Matt 21:5 \"SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, 'BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.'\"\n\n \n The New American Standard Bible? Johnny-come-lately.\n \n \n\n \n The Bible has withstood the test of time from skeptics for the past 2000 years. \n\n \n Would that be The New American Standard Bible? \n \n In any event, welcome back terral03.",

But what puzzles me is how you turned from a genteel poster into a rabid, mouth-foaming ad hominem attack dog.\n \n For the record again, it is not my translation. Biblical scholars have noticed the fatal error. I should point out the experts in question are mainstream scholars, not Christian fundamentalist apologists. \n \n \n\n The first hermaneutic principle when translating the bible is that God is perfect and humans are not. If there is an apparrent (note the word apparrent) error then it is deemed human not God that has the problem. \n\n \n That is similar to Barney Fife's first rule in jailhouse decorum. \"Rule number 1: Obey all rules!\" Is that any different than your interpretation of hermeneutics? \"Rule number 1: Scripture must interpret Scripture!\" Is there any better definition of mental slavery than that? I only see a hermetically sealed mind, unable and unwilling to allow even the faintest glimmer of light to peak through. We have nothing to discuss if that indeed is your position.\n \n \n \n\n Matthew was undoubtedly an eye witness.

Their skills and capabilities would all be at different levels.\n\n \n How did you arrive at that conclusion other than by leaps and bounds? Evidence please, and feel free to use infallible Scripture since that is your standard.\n \n Matthew: \"Here comes Jesus, riding on an XXX and a foal.\"\n \n Unknown secretary and a figment of E.F.'s mind: \"You mean, on an XXX, even a foal?\"\n \n Matthew: \"No, on both he rides.\" \n \n Phantom secretary, who was Matthew's companion and faithfully recording live events, according to E.F.: \"Wow, I wish I could see that, but I'm too busy scribing! I'm not too good at it you know.\" \n \n Let's be honest. The author of Matthew was working from O.T. texts and from the author of Mark's book to make it appear as though Jesus had fulfilled prophecy. He was not an eyewitness, but a fabricator. An unfortunate sidebar to this smoking gun is that Zechariah 9:9 is not even referring to a future messiah. The entire problem could have been avoided had the author of Matthew not copied that mistake from Mark's interpretation and attempted to embellish it. \n \n One other thing. Matthew 21:1-3:\n 21:1 \n And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,\n \n 21:2 \n Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an XXX tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.\n \n 21:3 \n And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.\n \n Isn't that theft? Didn't Jesus break the 8th commandment by ordering his disciples to steal--here the mistake is again--two animals?\n \n What a terrible web we weave, E.F. We've got worms everywhere all right.",

It is my hope that you may understand more fully why this \"smoking gun\" is not some simple translational error, but one that calls into question fundamental assertions of your faith. \n \n It has been alleged by Christians that the Old Testament contains predictions about a coming Jewish Messiah, or \"anointed king\" and that Jesus fulfilled all of them. Predictions about his virgin birth, his ministry, his betrayal and crucifixion--in other words, the main outlines of his life --were covered by the major prophets, most notably, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. There is another grouping in the Bible, the minor prophets, who predicted more localized, inconsequential events and as a result are marginalized in importance. Zechariah belongs to this latter group, as you are probably aware. He wrote about events related specifically to Syria.\n \n Scholars have pointed out the disjointed writing style in Zechariah, noting how two different writers are probably at work, notably from chapter 9 onwards, but nevertheless have brought to light the person the author(s) was referring to in 9:9. They believe it was a Judean governor named Zerubbabel, a man of Davidic bloodlines, who rebuilt the Jewish temple. \n http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/robert_price/psychics.html\n \n Questions:\n \n Did Jesus and his disciples, being mistaken about the allusion in Zechariah, stage a similar event to make it appear prophecy was being fulfilled?\n \n Or did the author of Matthew, in attempting to make all apparent prophesies of the Messiah come true, mistakenly assume the same mistake of Mark, which was a misunderstanding of Zechariah, and continue to expand the fabrication?\n \n Those are the only two possibilities I can think of.

This is a particularly fatal flaw, IMO, since it removes the author of the book of Matthew as a credible witness. Further, since neither Mark nor Luke were chosen disciples--we frankly don't know who they were-they thus relate a story which is at best third party, and the entire affair becomes very indistinct and problematic.

All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an XXX, and a colt the foal of an XXX. And brought the XXX, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. \n \n In actual fact, the prophecy that Matthew quoted only refers to one animal:\n \n Zechariah 9:9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an XXX, and upon a colt the foal of an XXX. \n The word 'and' in this sense means 'even', and should be translated as an interpretation of the first object. \n \n New International Version \n Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. \n Revised Standard Version \n Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on an XXX, on a colt the foal of an XXX. \n Matthew misunderstood the meaning of the passage, and has Christ riding on two animals. \n \n The other gospel writers only mention one animal: \n Mark 11:2,7 And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him. And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him. \n \n Luke 19:30, 35 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither. And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. \n \n John 12:14,15 And Jesus, when he had found a young XXX, sat thereon; as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an XXX's colt. \n End of quote.\n \n How can it be asserted the author of Matthew was an eyewitness to this event? It is ludicrous-outright comical-- to picture Jesus astride two animals making his way into Jerusalem. Let us be honest, the author made a translational error, mistaking the classical Hebrew word \"even\" for \"and\". Yet what a mistake it is. It proves to me \"Matthew\", the traditional tax collecting disciple, did not write it, or may have been auditing clients on that Palm Sunday weekend instead of witnessing the events and faithfully recording them, or never heard of a triumphal entry, or...\n \n Not only is this gun smoking, but it smells to high heaven also.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you're talking about with your Matthew 21:5 comparison to Zechariah 9:9.

   "I'm not sure what you're talking about with your Matthew 21:5 comparison to Zechariah 9:9. Check this comparison out.\n \n http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2021:5;%20Zech%209:9&version=49\n\n To see the problem, you have to look at 21:5 in context. From the same site:\n \n21:2 saying to them, \"Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me.\n \n 21:3 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and immediately he will send them.\n \n 21:4 This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:\n \n 21:5 SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, 'BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.'\n \n 21:6 The disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them\n \n 21:7 and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their coats on them; and He sat on the coats\n\n Obviously, the translation of 21:5 should match Zechariah, since it's a direct quote in the same language. However, you can see here that other modern translations have followed Matthew's lead, misinterpreting 'even' as 'and'. \n \n Reading the rest of Matthew 21, only the word 'and' makes sense: he is clearly talking about two animals. The New American Standard bible, on the other hand, has done what Matthew failed to do when he sat down to write chapter 21: correctly translate Zechariah. Matthew got it wrong, and the 'smoking gun' of him not being an eyewitness is that that error propagated into the rest of chapter 21. Had he been an eyewitness he would have talked of only one animal, and would have immediately understood that the 'and' in Zechariah meant 'even'.",

And Jesus fulfilled that prophecy to a T by entering Jerusalem on a Colt, or a donkey which had never been ridden.\n\n That's certainly an issue in its own right, yes - but Matthew's gaffe is suggestive of the kind of post-hoc jiggery-pokery that shaped the bible's contents.\n \n As far as fulfilling prophecy goes, is it really prophecy if someone knowingly sets out to make it come true? Zechariah could have had the Messiah turning up walking backwards eating a pork pie - so long as any would-be messiah knows what he has to do :) And when all's said and done, the New Testament was written decades after the fact, with the Old Testament near at hand, a desire to spread Christianity burning in the breast, and nobody to say these prophecies hadn't been fulfilled. I respect your decision to believe they were, but I don't see any objective reason to agree.",

   "Bible scholars point out a glaring error in the book of Matthew which strongly indicates to me that the author was not an eyewitness to any of Jesus' ministry as is historically claimed, but rather was some unknown scribe copying large sections of the Book of Mark-the oldest of the four gospels--and simply creating new details to make it appear Old Testament prophesies had been fulfilled.\n\n \n Could you name thses scholars who pointed to Matt 21:5 as an error?\n \n If Matthew copied from Mark then how did Paul quote from it in his letter to Thessalonians (noted by Orchard)?\n \n If the account was written by an unknown scribe then how come all the earliest mss attribute it to the same person? And why pick the name of a disciple who is virtually unknown outside of the name on the Gospel account?",
