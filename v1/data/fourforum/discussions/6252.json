   "Seven Things I Wish Pro-Gay People Would Admit\n By Bob Davies\n \n 1. I wish they would admit that many people are not happy with their homosexuality or lesbianism, and that this conflict is internal, based on legitimate, intelligent religious and moral convictions--not just the result of a so-called \"homophobic\" society which is forcing guilt upon people who don't conform to a heterosexual ethic. \n \n Stop throwing out the cheap, inaccurate labels like \"internalized homophobia\" to explain our motivations. \n \n 2. I wish they would acknowledge that homosexuals and lesbians can experience significant change in their sexual feelings and desires, even though they may never be totally heterosexual in their sexual thoughts and feelings. \n \n Be honest enough to admit that such change is significant and genuine, even if it isn't complete. \n \n 3. I wish they would acknowledge that many former homosexuals and lesbians have found a greater measure of peace and satisfaction after leaving a gay or lesbian lifestyle than they ever experienced while embracing homosexuality. \n \n Not all \"ex-gays\" are miserable, plotting how to secretly fulfill their homosexual lusts without being caught. \n \n 4. I wish they would acknowledge that many former homosexuals and lesbians have genuine joy in their marriages. \n \n Most former gays and lesbians don't get married in a futile attempt to \"escape\" homosexuality; they marry as a natural consequence of resolving that issue in their lives. \n \n 5. I wish they would acknowledge that all people have as much right to pursue a heterosexual lifestyle as they do to pursue homosexuality. \n \n Former homosexuals and lesbians should not be harassed and castigated by the gay community. But I have never heard any gay or lesbian leaders speak out against the violence (such as bomb threats and physical/verbal abuse) which some people perpetuate against Exodus ministries. \n \n 6. I wish they would stop equating our decision to leave homosexuality with \"hatred\" and \"bigotry\" against gays and lesbians. \n \n We don't hate gays; we simply desire to live free of homosexuality. Don't put nasty labels upon our motives. That's being judgmental and unfair. \n \n 7. I wish pro-gay religious leaders would admit that their endorsement and promotion of monogamous homosexual relationships is a facade. \n \n Many--probably most--men and women involved in long-term partnerships are not sexually monogamous, but gay churches don't discipline members for committing \"adultery\" outside their \"gay marriage.\" Neither do they discipline gays or lesbians who have sex before entering into a \"holy union\" with their partner. \n \n http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/narth/7things.html",

I wish they would acknowledge that many former homosexuals and lesbians have genuine joy in their marriages.\n\n \n I feel like I am repeating myself. All I ask is that you point me to just one. \n \n \nMost former gays and lesbians don't get married in a futile attempt to \"escape\" homosexuality; they marry as a natural consequence of resolving that issue in their lives. \n \n \n Please cite evidence.\n \n \n5. I wish they would acknowledge that all people have as much right to pursue a heterosexual lifestyle as they do to pursue homosexuality. \n \n \n I would like for anyone to point out where one homosexual person has ever said that people had no right to engage in heterosexual sex. Please cite one person who has ever said that heterosexuals should not have the right to have sex with the opposite gender.\n \n \nFormer homosexuals and lesbians should not be harassed and castigated by the gay community. But I have never heard any gay or lesbian leaders speak out against the violence (such as bomb threats and physical/verbal abuse) which some people perpetuate against Exodus ministries. \n \n \n Former homosexuals are not castigated for being former homosexuals.

   "Let su fully examine the reality of this post! Shallwe....\n \n \n \n\n [i]1. I wish they would admit that many people are not happy with their homosexuality or lesbianism, and that this conflict is internal, based on legitimate, intelligent religious and moral convictions--not just the result of a so-called \"homophobic\" society which is forcing guilt upon people who don't conform to a heterosexual ethic. \n \n\n There are thousands of people who are unhappy they are gay, no gay person I know will deny this....why do you think we are denying it? But the reason is that they are programed from a young age that being gay is a bad thing. Just like this entire thread does...Being gay is not a bad thing or is it a good thing. It is what you do as a gay man or women that counts..\n \n\n Stop throwing out the cheap, inaccurate labels like \"internalized homophobia\" to explain our motivations. \n\n That label is very accuate for many people. I have never met or even read about someone who it doesn't apply to. If these people are trying to change their sexuality it is because they are afraid they will go to hell, they are afraid they will not be accepted, they are afraid they won't be happy....if they were not afraid, they wouldn't change their sexuality, they would just live their lives, find a mate, settle down....blah, blah...reminder a phobia is being afraid....\n \n\n 2. I wish they would acknowledge that homosexuals and lesbians can experience significant change in their sexual feelings and desires, even though they may never be totally heterosexual in their sexual thoughts and feelings. \n \n Be honest enough to admit that such change is significant and genuine, even if it isn't complete. \n \n\n This is so vague. the change isn't complete? how about the having the ex-gay movement admit that no one has changed. or that the number of those who have is very low. Instead the number is inflated beyond reality.....\n the ex-gay movement including S. Bennett, And exodus use to claim thousands had changed, then it one 100's of thousands, now it is 10's of thousands....and the change in numbers has only been in the past year or two...where is the evidence of these claims?\n example:\n \"Exodus now fields more than 400,000 inquiries each year at its headquarters in Orlando. A staff member directs each inquirer to the member ministry closest to his home, where he can receive counseling and support. \"The No. 1 call we get is from males struggling with homosexuality,\" says Mr. Chambers. \"The No. 2 call is from parents who have a child struggling with it.\"\n \n There are only so many ways to break down the callers; probably gay men, lesbians, parents, pastors, activists, generic straight people. If the largest number of callers are gay men, a conservative estimate would be 25% of the 400,000 callers are gay men.\n \n So Alan Chambers is claiming AT LEAST 100,000 gay men call every year for Exodus' information.\n \n For populations I'm using http://www.census.gov/statab/www/pop.html\n \n As of 2003 there are 107 million men above the age of 18 living in the US. I don't know the gay male population, but in the last national election 4% self-identified as gay or lesbian in exit polls. The gay male population, by all accounts, is significantly larger than the lesbian population. But a reasonable estimate for our purposes here might be 5 million gay men live in the US (a little less than 5% of the male adult population).\n \n Thus, Chambers is claiming that every year AT LEAST 2% of the gay male population calls for Exodus' help. Over a short time period (say five years) that would grow to 10%, or one in ten.\n \n That's an amazing claim.\n \n I'm sure most of the people reading this have at least 100 gay friends that they know well enough to be aware of whether they called Exodus in the past 5 years.\n \n I don't know of any in my closest 100 gay friends. In fact, of the many hundreds (possibly thousands) of my gay acquaintances, I only know of two in the past decade that have contacted an ex-gay group. I live in Los Angeles and have been out for a long time so my likelihood of knowing gay men who are \"struggling\" is much lower than if I were closeted in Baton Rouge. Yet still this claim seems extreme.\n \n Alan, I know you come on here sometimes. Tell us, are you claiming that over a five year period at least 10% of all gay men will contact your organization? Or, as you probably estimate the total gay population smaller than I, is it a larger percentage that call you?\n http://www.exgaywatch.com/blog/archives/2005/08/world_magazine_1.html#comments\n \n\n 3. I wish they would acknowledge that many former homosexuals and lesbians have found a greater measure of peace and satisfaction after leaving a gay or lesbian lifestyle than they ever experienced while embracing homosexuality. \n \n\n This could be acknowledged if you showed us some proof, but as of now we only see some very inaccurate studies and some testimonies that could be years old? There is no proof. It just sounds like propaganda to sell books, tapes, conferences, etc.... If it is really true, then why not do a real study on it? It would be a scientific break through if it were true. The reluctance to prove it as fact just tells us it is false.\n \n\n Not all \"ex-gays\" are miserable, plotting how to secretly fulfill their homosexual lusts without being caught. \n \n\n NOt all? so only some, so if most but not all, but it is still true....maybe one in ten isn't doing it but the other 9 are...what does this mean?\n \n\n 4. I wish they would acknowledge that many former homosexuals and lesbians have genuine joy in their marriages. \n \n\n Because there is more evidence aginst this being true than there is evidence to say it isn't!\n \n\n Most former gays and lesbians don't get married in a futile attempt to \"escape\" homosexuality; they marry as a natural consequence of resolving that issue in their lives. \n \n\n NEWSFLASH<<<<<<< Gay men having been getting married and staying married to women for years....they love there wives and children...they are still gay! What is this man's point here??? I was goping to get married, if I had I would have stayed married, I loved her. I wasn't that sexually attracted to her,really not at all, but I would have managed. It deosn't mean I wasn't gay!\n \n\n 5. I wish they would acknowledge that all people have as much right to pursue a heterosexual lifestyle as they do to pursue homosexuality. \n \n\n of course they do, but why would you want to pursue unhappiness? I could run off and join the circus too, doesn't mean it is a good idea.\n \n\n Former homosexuals and lesbians should not be harassed and castigated by the gay community. But I have never heard any gay or lesbian leaders speak out against the violence (such as bomb threats and physical/verbal abuse) which some people perpetuate against Exodus ministries. \n \n\n funny, I never hear the ex-gay movement fight for the rights of gays to have their rights, why should I fight for theirs? make sense...In fact the ex-gay movement is asking us to fight for their right to change, but fights against are right to not change. WOW, talk about guts!\n \n\n 6. I wish they would stop equating our decision to leave homosexuality with \"hatred\" and \"bigotry\" against gays and lesbians. \n \n\n Visit any website for an ex-gay movement and tell us exactly how we couldn't deduct bigotry and prejudice with the hundreds, upon hundreds of lies they have about gays......Alan Cummings the head of Exodus testifies against us in front of congress to deny rights to gays and we are not suppose to find it predjudiced and bigoted when he lies on the stand about the horrors of being gay????? get real?\n \n\n We don't hate gays; we simply desire to live free of homosexuality. Don't put nasty labels upon our motives. That's being judgmental and unfair. \n \n\n Then go ahead and live free of homosexuality, don't let me stop you, but don't stop me from living my life with my partner and demand I be treated like other (hetero) couples when I pay the same taxes as them! Go ahead, live free of what ever you like....but don't demand that I do it! Land of the free means you do what you want, I do what I want. Deal!\n \n\n 7. I wish pro-gay religious leaders would admit that their endorsement and promotion of monogamous homosexual relationships is a facade. \nNo one will admit to this. It isn't true. Simply enough this is a lie! Enough Said on that. Until god comes down and says otherwises....it is a lie!\n \n\n Many--probably most--men and women involved in long-term partnerships are not sexually monogamous, but gay churches don't discipline members for committing \"adultery\" outside their \"gay marriage.\" Neither do they discipline gays or lesbians who have sex before entering into a \"holy union\" with their partner.\n\n You have no evidence of any of this. I have been with my partner for 5 plus years and we have both been faithful to each other......get real!",

I wish they would stop equating our decision to leave homosexuality with \"hatred\" and \"bigotry\" against gays and lesbians. \n \n\n I agree.\n \n\n We don't hate gays; we simply desire to live free of homosexuality. Don't put nasty labels upon our motives. That's being judgmental and unfair. \n \n 7. I wish pro-gay religious leaders would admit that their endorsement and promotion of monogamous homosexual relationships is a facade. \n \n\n hmm. What if this isn't true?",

   "The harm of conversion\n therapy\n The studies cited above allege that a typical\n success rate for conversion therapies is\n about 30%. Surprisingly, those researchers\n never question what might have happened\n to the other 70%. The only comment that\n conversion therapists offer is that sexual\n orientation is difficult to change.21 All conversion\n therapy rests solidly on the assumption\n that homosexuality is in conflict with a\n fulfilling life, balancing out any risks from\n treatment in the eyes of those therapists. It\n is important to ask if these treatments\n might result in negative consequences,\n however.\n This author's fifteen years of clinical\n experience with gay men who have gone\n through some form of conversion therapy\n suggests a wide variability in the way people\n are affected. All of the following comments\n are based upon the author's own clinical\n observations and numerous anecdotal\n reports which await confirmation in controlled\n studies.\n Some-but not all-conversion therapy\n clients are harmed. In particular, those who\n have undergone treatments such as electric\n shock or drugs inducing vomiting while\n homoerotic material is presented are likely\n to have been harmed the most. Many such\n individuals seen in my practice are not only\n tormented by an exacerbated level of shame\n but are physically rendered \"asexual\"-not\n changed into heterosexuals, but no longer\n functioning as homosexuals either.\n In recent years, however, refugees from\n such cruel therapies have become less common\n in this author's practice as these treatments\n have fallen into disfavor. At present,\n the majority of former conversion therapy\n clients, or \"ex-ex-gays\", as they are sometimes\n known, have gone through a religious,\n prayer-based program or a talk-oriented\n therapy of some sort. Such individuals\n often experience continued depression\n over their homosexuality, compounded with\n a sense of shame over having failed at conversion\n therapy. Further, they may have a\n psychologically debilitating sense of having\n lost those important life elements-family\n of origin, religious affiliation, social support-\n for which there was still some hope\n as long as the individual was trying to\n change. Some former conversion therapy\n clients report extraordinary difficulties with\n interpersonal interactions, and particularly\n sexual intimacy, with same-sex partners.\n The author's own clinical practice and\n the views of other practitioners working\n with former conversion therapy clients suggest\n that the problems associated with conversion\n therapy are not limited to the client.\n The goal of conversion treatments is to\n involve other individuals in the client's\n romantic and sexual life. For the ex-spouses\n and children of conversion therapy \"experiment\n relationships,\" the sense of betrayal\n and loss can be devastating. Very often individuals\n and family members who have been\n caught in the conversion therapy process\n need counseling of their own.\n http://www.iglss.org/media/files/Angles_41.pdf",

   "In brief, the key points are:\n \n Ex-gay ministries are motivated by politics rather than faith. Their political agenda is to block any acceptance of gay people into society. By repeatedly insisting that sexual orientation can be unlearnt, they hammer home the message that gay people should not be given equal rights.\n \n This cause is also a highly-effective way to raise funds from fellow Christians - a cash cow, especially as fighting godless communism no longer opens people's purses, now that the Soviet Union has vanished.\n \n The medical, psychiatric and psychological professional bodies all disagree that sexual orientation can be changed. They have also said that so-called \"reparative therapy\" aimed at altering gay peoples' orientations does not work and may, in fact, be harmful.\n \n As a counter to these professional bodies, the Christian rightwing has an organization called the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, or NARTH. According to its policy statement, \"NARTH's most important function is to provide psychological understanding of the cause, treatment, and behavior patterns associated with the homosexual condition.\" NARTH uses as its starting point, the presumption that homosexuality is a developmental disorder or a mental illness, which it frequently compares to alcoholism, presumptions rejected by the professional bodies. However, NARTH frequently accuses these professional bodies of conspiracies against it.\n \n The true problem is more mundane. NARTH's studies are not peer-reviewed. Their own data about the success rate of sexuality conversion are muddled at best. There are no longitudinal studies (i.e. following up cases for many years), and without longitudinal studies, how does one show that there has been any permanent change in the subjects, as opposed to temporary denial? \n And there are countless examples of backsliding among even the leaders of these ex-gay movements, as discussed above.\n \n http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2003/yax-337.htm",

   "Ex-gays and gay rights are not separate issues.......The ex-gay movement works very hard at fighting against gays and lesbian rights.....\n \n \n \n \n \n Exodus Membership Director Campaigns against Gay Couples\n Randy Thomas, the membership director of Exodus, spoke at a press conference by the promoters of a constitutional amendment in Florida to ensure that gay couples are not allowed the same rights as heterosexual couples. As reported by the Florida Baptist Witness:\n \n Thomas, a former homosexual, said proponents of traditional marriage forced him to consider the legitimacy of homosexuality and \"gay marriage,\" which led to his departure from the homosexual lifestyle. \n \"I was not happy with the conservatives back in the 80's, but what they did was they challenged me to dialogue,\" he said.\n \n Thomas affirmed the coalition's repudiation of bigotry against homosexuals. \n \n \"We support a person's right to self-determination. But we don't want one person's determination to affect all of us,\" he added.\n \n \n I have a few thoughts on Thomas' statements and inclusion at the press conference.\n \n First, to the best of my recollection, gay marriage was never mentioned back in the 80's. There were no proponents of traditional marriage to force him to consider anything at all. This seems to be a newly concocted slant and frankly untrue.\n \n Second, why is Thomas at a rally to make certain that gay couples have restricted rights? Thomas is the MEMBERSHIP DIRECTOR of Exodus. Is Exodus actually trying to pretend that persons struggling with SSA are going to be drawn to Exodus by trying to stop them from marrying?\n \n It is not by accident that the membership director for Exodus is actively involved in the restriction of rights to gay people. I think it highly likely that the membership that Exodus is seeking to attract is not gay people at all. If your target is actually gay people, this seems either counter-productive or, at best, as waste of time.\n \n I can't be certain, but it seems at least likely that Exodus is seeking a different type of membership, perhaps anti-gay individuals or organizations, either political or religious. These seem the likely audience reached by this sort of effort.\n \n Third, Randy is claiming that \"we\" (presumably Exodus) supports self-determination. And yet when Randy was ministy manager for Exodus, in an article in Christianity Today he was quoted as warning that:\n \n Randy Thomas, ministry manager for Exodus International, an Orlando-based ministry helping people leave homosexuality, said Lawrence will shape public policy. \n \"This ruling gives validity to the gay community,\" Thomas said. In addition to potentially redefining the family, it further solidifies their position as a political and social force.\"\n \n \n Lawrence v. Texas was the Supreme Court decision that said that states could not criminalize gay people (i.e. it allowed them self-determination).\n \n It seems very clear that Thomas has a truth deficit.\n \n http://www.exgaywatch.com/blog/index.html",

   "You're right, you aren't on the same page as they are.\n\n \n Indeed. The narrow dictums of their religious dogma does not provide them with the scope of education necessary to fully understand sexuality. Do this, don't do that, don't question why. There are other sources of information on any issue, besides religious dogma, as dictated and unquestioned.\n \n \nThat's what dealing with temptation is all about. For others like NARTH, they focus on the psychological aspect; they truly do try to change people's desires and orientation. But that doesn't often work.\n\n \n No, they are only concerned about one's lifestyle or surface appearance as well, judging by the comments of NARTH's director. As long as a guy has a wife at home, has married straight men in his circle of friends, and only acts homosexually once a week, that guy is a success!(he appears to live a \"straight lifestyle\")....\n \n \n We seem to have travelled a long way from the radical claims being made so confidently on stage at Love Won Out. And we are about to depart even farther. \"Let's say,\" Nicolosi suddenly suggests, \"you work with a man for six months. Let's say he acts out once a week in the beginning, but when he acts out he tortures himself, beats himself up, thinks he's a pervert. After six months in therapy, he understands why he acts out. He's still acting out once a week, but it's more like a hollow ritual. He's not as upset with himself, he's more hopeful of change in the future. Now, his behaviour is still the same. Would you consider that a success?\" \n \n Would you? \n \n \"Yes,\" Nicolosi replies, \"I would consider that a success.\" Even the most successful ex-gay, he adds casually, is always going to have to keep an eye on himself, to make sure he \"doesn't fall\". \n \n But surely that is the opposite of inner change? It sounds closer to a definition of willpower. \n \n \"But he has changed! He's changed in the sense that, instead of living a gay lifestyle, he has a wife that he loves emotionally and sexually, and he has three kids, and his friends are married men. Isn't that a change? That's a change. He may still get a little same-sex titillation from time to time, sure, and he'd better be realistic about that. I mean, he's setting himself up for a fall if he really believes he won't. OK?\" \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1183596,00.html\n \n \nThe issue is when you expect everyone else to do that--it's not your place to expect everyone else to live the way you do. If some claim to have learned to live a heterosexual life, that's their decision.\n\n \n You're right. I don't expect them to live any way, however. If people want to be staright, let them be straight. If people want to live an unspoken lie, and merely appear straight, they can do that too. That person is still homosexual or gay. Sexuality is more than acting a certain way. This is a gay person who tries to avoid his or her gay sexuality.",

   "No, the point is (which you'd know if you'd read the thread from the beginning) that the victims in all too many cases of demonization are those claiming to be ex-gays.\n \n Why can't you just let them live their lives and leave them alone?\n\n \n \n I have read the thread from the very beginning. If you remember (which is something you conveniently won't do) I posted one of the first responses to that ridiculous link you started off the thread with. \n \n I (and a few others) found it interesting that the person who wrote those bullets feels compelled to demonize gays and our relationships.\n \n Gay people don't generally think of the ex-gay. It only comes up when these ministries are found to be funding anti-gay initiatives and spouting bigotted rhetoric. \n \n As for the typical 'ex-gay' (why don't they just call themselves straight if they're supposed to be cured), I couldn't care less about. The only time I call them on their bull is when you see them on television or in TIME magazine telling the rest of us happy XXXXXX that we SHOULD change just because they supposedly did. And I don't feel guilty for feeling a bit of schaudenfreud after seeing that media whore, John Paulk , fall from grace after being caught at Mr. P's. \n \n The only people I feel really bad for are the children that result from those tragic marriages that were doomed to fail from the get-go, as well as for those unfortunate children from extremely fundamentalist families who are forced to go to these conversion therapy sesssions.",
