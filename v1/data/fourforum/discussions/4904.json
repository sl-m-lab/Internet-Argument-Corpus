   "Ga. Gov. Signs Voter ID Mandate Into Law \n \n Fri Apr 22,11:56 AM ET U.S. National - AP \n \n By KRISTEN WYATT, Associated Press Writer \n \n ATLANTA - Gov. Sonny Perdue on Friday signed into law a requirement that voters show photo identification before casting ballots, legislation that had prompted most black lawmakers to walk out of the state Capitol. \n \n Previously, registered voters could present a Social Security card or other non-photo ID when they arrived to vote. Republicans, who control both legislative chambers, pushed the plan as a way to crack down on voter fraud. \n \n \n \"I believe this is a reasonable requirement,\" said Perdue, also a Republican. \"It will not be a hardship on any voter.\" \n \n \n Democrats argued the law would unfairly target the elderly, the poor and minorities - those most likely not to have photo identification. The state AARP and League of Women Voters joined Democrats and civil rights groups opposed to the plan. \n \n \n Black Democrats in the Legislature stormed out of the House and Senate the night the bill was approved, and rallies were held decrying the measure. Earlier this month, Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., publicly called on Perdue to veto the bill. \n \n \n The changes will not take effect until the U.S. Department of Justice approves the new law. Georgia, like other states with a history of suppressing minority votes, must get federal permission for changes in voting requirements. \n \n http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=519&ncid=703&e=3&u=/ap/20050422/ap_on_re_us/georgia_voter_id\n \n Can states legally deny people the right to vote because they don't have a Photo ID?",
