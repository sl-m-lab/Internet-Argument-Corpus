   " Advocates for abortion fail to understand the ramifications of their philosophy and the path that it leads towards. Eugenics and Euthanasia (so-called \"death with dignity\") are linked to abortion in many ways. \n\n Though there is some overlap in ideology between many pro-choice stances and Euthenasia, I see problems with you including Eugenics in the mix. The official definition of Eugenics from the Merriam-Webster on-line dictionary is: a science that deals with the improvement (as by control of human mating) of hereditary qualities of a race or breed . Discussions of Eugenics in the past (Nazi regime, etc.) involved the State being in control of human mating to achieve the goals of hypothetical improvement in the human species. State's intrusion into people's mating and reproductive choices goes against everything that pro-choice people believe in. Ironically, it is much closer to the pro-Life stance, which gives the State the right to control people's reproductive choices.\n \n As for Euthenasia, speaking at least for myself, that overlaps with abortion from the point of view that what is precious in a person is their mental existence. Before that mental existence develops (early fetus) or after it degenerates (severely brain damaged human in a vegetative state), there is no mental existence, no mind, no thoughts or emotions or feelings - nothing but a body. The worth of a body itself is much less, in my mind, to that of a body with a mind. Therefore, I advocate for the legality of abortion (before the third trimester) as well as the legality of Euthenasia of those who are so brain damaged that they no longer have a mental existence.\n \n As for physician-assisted suicide, I believe that, if someone is terminally ill and faces an excruciatingly painful death, then they should be able to choose to take their own life early in the least painful way possible through physician assisted suicide. The only concerns I have with this include:\n 1) There might be corrupt physicians that try to hasten the death of a terminal patient by trying to convince them to commit physician assisted suicide in situations where they themselves might not otherwise choose that path.\n 2) When a patient is suffering but not terminal, they may be so depressed that they wish to die in a situation where there is still reasonable hope.",

Went on to create one of the most abusive regimes against the sanctity of life despite his \"culture of life\" stance. \n \n Cambodia - When the Khmer Rouge regime waged genocide abortion was illegal. \n \n Rwanda - The supremely Christian nation of Rwanda in 1994 conducted one of the most steadfast and concentrated mass killings in recorded history.

Would later give WMDs to the pro-life Ba'athist regime of Iraq so they could be used to suppress Kurdish rebellion. \n \n George W Bush - Went as far to arm poor, defenseless Angolan children who were conscripted for war.

   "I am so sick and tired of beating this dead horse about Sanger was a racist/eugenics. Here, ONCE AND FOR ALL, I am going to END IT so you silly lifers can move on the better things...like making more unsympathetic comparisons to abortion and the holocaust or printing off more blown up abortion pictures. \n \n \n\n \"Birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race.\"\n\n \n The statement is too ambiguous to suggest anything about racism or eugenics. \n \n \n \n\n \"We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population. and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.\"\n\n \n The statement is taken completely out of context. Sanger was aware of African-American concerns, passionately argued by Marcus Garvey in the 1920s, that birth control was a threat to the survival of the black race. This statement, which acknowledges those fears, is taken from a letter to Clarence J. Gamble, M.D., a champion of the birth control movement. In that letter, Sanger describes her strategy to allay such apprehensions. A larger portion of the letter makes Sanger's meaning clear: \n \"It seems to me from my experience . . . in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas, that while the colored Negroes have great respect for white doctors, they can get closer to their own members and more or less lay their cards on the table. . . . They do not do this with the white people, and if we can train the Negro doctor at the clinic, he can go among them with enthusiasm and with knowledge, which, I believe, will have far-reaching results. . . . His work, in my opinion, should be entirely with the Negro profession and the nurses, hospital, social workers, as well as the County's white doctors. His success will depend upon his personality and his training by us. The minister's work is also important, and also he should be trained, perhaps by the Federation, as to our ideals and the goal that we hope to reach. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs \n \n \n \n\n \"Eugenics is ? the most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial, political and social problems.\n\n \n Why don't you try an actual quotation from Sanger instead of what someone else said in the Birth Control Review. \n Sanger on Eugenics.\n \n Eugenists imply or insist that a woman's first duty is to the state; we contend that her duty to herself is her first duty to the state. We maintain that a woman possessing an adequate knowledge of her reproductive functions is the best judge of the time and conditions under which her child should be brought into the world. We further maintain that it is her right, regardless of all other considerations, to determine whether she shall bear children or not, and how many children she shall bear if she chooses to become a mother (1919a).",

   "Time for a counterattack! Yee-ha!\n \n RACISM IN THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT\n \n - America's Promise Ministries(http://amprom.org/Trent.htm); In \"The Torture And Death of Saint Simon of Trent,\" claims that \"hundreds of thousands of children disappear every year in the world, perhaps some of them victims of zionist ritual murder[abortion]...\"\n \n - God's Order Affirmed in Love (GOAL) (http://www.melvig.org/jrm/jrm_toc.html); Look under, \"Jewish Ritual Murder,\" by Arnold Leese details almost every known instance of blood accusation without, however, including the results -the murders of thousands of Jews in retribuation. The piece ends with the speculation that the Lindberg baby was a Jewish ritual murder. \n \n - Most surprising of all is the American Life League's\n \"The Position Of The Jewish Faith On Abortion\" (http://www.all.org/plae/plae044.htm). They state that, \"The most galling irony of all is that the Jews are themselves completing the task that Hitler and all of his legions could not accomplish. It is also excruciatingly true that, for a period of eight centuries (from 1144 to 1945), virtually all of the major persecutions of the Jews were based upon unfounded allegations of ritual child murder. Now, in the United States, Jews enjoy freedom from genocide -- but have led the drive for legalizing the slaughter of preborn children, a uniquely Modernistic form of ritual child murder on a massive scale.\" ALL is a pretty legitimate Pro-Life group, almost like the National Right to Life Committee (a matter of fact ALL was made by a NRLC member) except more serious when it comes to abortion. \n \n - \"The first 'Holocaust,' with its possible imaginary mass slaughter, has been used to create a false sense of guilt in Christian nations by making them feel that their Christian heritage did nothing, really, to keep them from committing acts of vicious cruelty, and has been called, 'A sneak attack on Christianity.'\" - Father Paul Marx, President of Human Life International.\n \n \"...the white Western world is committing suicide...I guess we have 250,000 Vietnamese here already, and they are going to have large families; the Orientals always do. God knows how many Mexicans cross the border every night... And if we ever have to fight the Russians, I wonder if these people will be willing to stake their lives.\" - Father Paul Marx, President of Human Life International.\n \n - \"They have opened the floodgates of immigration, diluting our blood while slaughtering those of our Race by the millions. In fact, the White Race's proportion of the world's population is steadily declining.\" - Pro-Life Activist, Malcom Ross, on the destruction of the White race. \n \n - [The] \"final solution\" and Holocaust against the Jewish people, is a\n \"myth\"...The problem is there is a group trying to\n give the whole world, but particularly the Germans and the white\n Anglo-Saxons, a guilt trip for six million deaths that didn't\n take place and that's primarily it.\" - Ann Molloy, the president of the Victoria Pro-life Society\n \n - \"Almost all abortion doctors are Jews. Abortion makes money for Jews. Almost all abortion nurses are lesbians. Abortion gives thrills to lesbians. Abortion in Orange County is promoted by the corrupt Jewish organization\n called Planned Parenthood... Jews must be punished for this holocaust and murder of white children along with their perverted lesbian nurses.\" - Tom Metzger, fuhrer of the Fallbrook, California-based, White Aryan Resistance\n \n - Barry Wray, president of the local Pro-Life Society in\n Melville, Saskatchewan, told a Vancouver Sun reporter that he is\n an associate of Wolfgang Droege, the founder of the white\n supremacist Heritage Front (HF). Wray has said he also attended a\n 1986 Aryan Nations meeting at Hayden Lake, Idaho; a leading\n center of the white supremacist and Christian Patriot movement\n throughout North America. \n \n - Pro-Life Society president, Barry Wray, also boasts of his\n close association with Ernst Zundel, one of the largest\n publishers of neo-Nazi literature in the world.",

   "Funny how that contrasts with reality. Some of the most horrific atrocities in history were committed by pro-lifers. Once again, the blood is all over your hands...your philosophy is somehow rendering human life cheap. \n \n Hitler - Nazi Germany conducted one of the most harshest laws against abortion in German history. \"Abortion on demand\" was criminalized and abortionists were sentenced to death if found guilty. \n \n Stalin - Criminalized abortion after Lenin had legalized it. Went on to create one of the most abusive regimes against the sanctity of life despite his \"culture of life\" stance. \n \n Cambodia - When the Khmer Rouge regime waged genocide abortion was illegal. \n \n Rwanda - The supremely Christian nation of Rwanda in 1994 conducted one of the most steadfast and concentrated mass killings in recorded history. Over 800,000 were murdered with no more then a machete within less then a year. \n \n Catholic Church - Slaughtered millions upon millions of those based solely upon their beliefs but is the beacon of the entire Pro-life movement today. The Catholic Church's crimes against humanity include genocide, slavery and protecting war criminals. \n \n Ronald Reagan - Supported terrorism in Central America that killed, maimed and raped 100,000 innocents. Would later give WMDs to the pro-life Ba'athist regime of Iraq so they could be used to suppress Kurdish rebellion. \n \n George W Bush - Went as far to arm poor, defenseless Angolan children who were conscripted for war. Despite Angola's abuse on the pro-life \"culture of life\" Bush continued to arm while attaining $$$. \n \n Congrats, must feel good to have Stalin, Hitler, Reagan and etc. share your \"culture of life.\"\n\n \n \n I don't get why people link infamous people and actions with personal opinion. Personally, I don't think it makes you a bad person to share some of the same views as, say, Hitler. It's how you interpret these similarities. For example, just because I happen to be against abortion does not mean that I'm going to kill a bunch of people because they aborted their pregnancies. I don't like it, but I deal with it in the world around me. It's just plain foolish to try to guilt people about their beliefs by linking them to cruel people and actions. We don't kill of all the Republicans because a couple of them were corrupt, so we shouldn't label people this way. I know it's off topic, but I had to say it.:xbanghead",
