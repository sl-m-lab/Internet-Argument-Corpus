Studies of its inheritance through the sexual phase, and segregation from an amplified esterase marker gene, showed that crossing over occurred during oogenesis, but in in spermatogenesis, confirming previous cytological observations. Only a small number of progeny resulted from attempts at selfing fusion heterozygotes, and none of these was homozygous for the fusion. A2+3 paired in parallel alignment with the separate A2 and A3 to form a trivalent at prophase I of spermatogenesis. Fusion heterozygotes had a segregation problem at anaphase I of meiosis, A2+3 forming a chromatin bridge between the daughter spermatocytes in about 42% of dividing cells, which could be attributed to alternate orientation in the trivalent (A2 and A3 paired with opposite sides of A2+3) in the preceding metaphase I. Males heterozygous for an A2 dissociation were also studied and found to have much less of a segregation problem, despite showing similar orientation patterns at metaphase I. Possible reasons for this difference and the significance of the findings in relation to karyotype evolution in aphids are discussed.",
