We'll never know what would have happened if Al Gore was elected so I refuse to speculate on that issue. Bush is under the magnifying glass because he is president and his actions affect all of us, therefore what he does is fair game for discussion. You have to realize that a large number of Americans weren't and aren't for the Iraq war. Everyday there is a constant reminder in the news to fuel that fire. If you want to post propaganda about the war, you have to be ready to defend it. If you personally feel safer as a result of the invasion, your choice in November will be clear, for everyone else that never thought Iraq or Saddam was a threat to us, we'll take a look at all the candidates. I never blamed George Jr. for the recession, I only judge him on what he's done to get us out of it.",

I'm letting the rules of engagement from another board I participate on spill over to this respectable site. I'm sorry for that.\n \n I'll edit my post.\n \n As you may have guessed, as hawks and doves go, I'm a bird of prey.\n \n BTW, I think Bush's plan is benefiting the economy.

Although I will admit age and maturity don't always follow the same graph. Anyway, a lot of us that came from another forum are used to VERY strict rules, so were used to \"walking on eggshells\" as they say.

That means you'll be reading more and more 'good news' of 'unemployment claims drop'. \n \n But maybe there's hope for them with plenty of talk going around about reviving the draft. If draftees get the same pay/benefits as regular troops now receive, most could be making more than at their former occupations. Some risks, but a government funded college education and 'readjustment allowance' is part of the deal. Let's see, it took Saddam 400,000 troops to control Iraq, so the numbers would be about right.",
