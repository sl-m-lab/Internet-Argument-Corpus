When November comes around, Americans will decide if they really feel \"safer\" in this new more democratic world.\n\n \n This just underscores the gullibility of the American people. At the start of the war, polls were showing over 90% in favor. I can remember keeping my opinions to myself (not something I do very often) because otherwise I ended up debating with evrybody within earshot. NOTHING HAS CHANGED. Prior to the war, we knew everything we know now about Iraqs AQ connections, namely that they were suspect at best. The UN weapons inspection team was issuing monthly reports and saying \"we are getting cooperation, but there is nothing here. The intel is bad.\"\n \n Yet, over 90% of America lined up eyes open and jaws dropped as the Bussh administration beat the war drum. What is wrong with Americans? I have found that if I just assume that those in power are lying to us, I am usually right. This should not be news fro anybody. Dishonest politicians have become a cliche in America, yet every day there are folks right here on this board, who seem otherwise entirely reasonable, arguing that their golden boy would NEVER lie to the public. Everything that comes from the mouth of whoevers lies they happen to be believing lately are the god inspired truth.\n \n As far as whether or not Edwards will help Kerry, I don;t really care one way or the other. This election is not about who will best serve America. It is instead, like too many recent elections, about who you percieve to be the lesser of two evils. Is it ereally that much to ask that we get a canidate who is just a good guy, has not sold his sould to special interests, and who will resist the pressures put upon him by the political elite who run his party? \n \n The problem with electing the lesser of two evils is that no matter which way you go, you are still not getting anybody good.",

   "Like I said, a French  company. My initial digression from the topic of John Edwards was to correct a misrepresentation by someone who claimed Haliburton got a no-bid contract. They were trying to mislead you into thinking that Haliburton was given an unfair advantage over other eligible companies. There were no eligible companies. There was ONE French company that could have done but did not deserve the work!\n \n Apparently, you missed the thread some time back about the French War for Oil. It mentioned the company...and I think it also confirmed that it was the only company besides Haliburton qualified to do the work.\n \n You might ask yourself, what qualifies John Edwards to be the President of the United States?\n\n \n Jim, I was the one that stated Haliburton got the contracts \"no-bid\". This is a fact, regardless of the rationale, there were no bids. I don't want to bicker over these interpretations of how Haliburton got the work, they got it, no one else was allowed to compete for it, it's just that simple. The company I was referring to was a company out of Texas that had oil field experience in the Middle East and their comments are in the article, they aren't French. As to the question you want me to ask myself about John Edwards as President, why don't you ask yourself the same question about the last 4 or 5 presidents that got elected. We have a movie star, a peanut farmer, and a couple of state governors. Since none of them can balance a budget, we don't want to blame any of them for the economy, where did any of them get their experience in handling foreign affairs? There is no job that prepares anyone for being President other than maybe being First Lady.",

   "daewoo: How close would you consider McCain to be in terms of truism?\n\n \n I actually like McCain, despite the fact that he supported that huge pork barrel social program that recently passed (prescription plan).\n \n The odds of him ever being the president are slim to none. There are already rumblings in the republican party about dumping arizona (loosing the election to the democrats) to get rid of him. He is embaressing a lot of republicans by drawing public attention to some of their recent policies. I love his web page. He has an entire section devoted to \"pork\". \n \n What I like the most about McCain is that, to the best of my knowledge, his voting record reflects his public policy statements without fail. As far as I know, he is one of only about 4 congressmen who can say this. He does not just jump on board with the GOP.\n \n I am still a little confused by his support of the prescription plan. Looking at his voting record, he is not real big on vote trading, so I doubt that this is the case in this situation. The only reason I can think of for his vote was that the prescription plan was VERY popular in his home state, and he was actually representing his constituents as opposed to trying to push through some kind of weird personal agenda.\n \n If the system was full of guys like McCain, who you could basically elect then forget about, knowing that they would go to the hill and vote in accordance with the beliefs they laid out when campaigning as opposed to trading off their vote so you can get other people to support whatever barrel of pork you are pushing when your turn comes around, I think the system would be salvagable wihtout question.\n \n Honestly, the way things are now, I have my doubts.",

   "The thread isn't about Haliburton, it's about attempting to villainize John Edwards for making money as a trial lawyer. Apparently Republicans protect their own wealthy politicians, but cry foul when a competitor makes a good living. I'm not defending Edwards profession in any way shape or form, but I'll defend his constitutional right to do so until someone has the stones to reform our \"tort\" law. My point was simply that Cheney was able to secure a \"sweetheart\" deal with Haliburton to make millions of dollars for himself and billions of dollars for Haliburton as a result of his political affiliations and clout within the party. I have no idea who else could have done the work in Iraq but we'll never know since it wasn't bid. If you read the article in full, there was at least one other company with oil field experience. In addition, most people don't even know the scope of what Haliburton is doing so it's impossible to say no one else could have done it. I'd be curious to see the financial reports on Haliburton and how much of their overall revenues benefit the United States. They obviously are a global company. I'll close my post with a quote from the CBS article I linked to in my last reply:\n \n \"Why would a defense secretary, former chief of staff to a president, and former member of congress with no business experience ever in his life, not for a day, why would he become the CEO of a multibillion dollar oil services company,\" asks Lewis\n\n \n \n Cheney did not make any money off of the Haliburton contract. Haliburton has been used many times in the past for rebuilding, this is not something out of the ordinary.\n \n By the way, do you know what the purpose of a CEO is? It is not to run the company, or make business descisions by himself. a CEO's job is to be the public relations face for the company, to lead the company and set the direction the company is going to go. A CEO is more of a leader than a decision maker. Presidents and VP's are who runs the day to day operations. Many CEO's have no business experience, such as Michael Eisner, one of the most succsessful CEO's ever (until recent times) however, there would be no Disney without him.",

Both of these events propelled Liberal agendas because the Republican opposition had been neutered. LBJ was pretty much given Carte Blanc because the people saw him as furthering a martyr's dreams and EVERTBODY in Congress knew that opposition was a likely ticket home.

For example, when Clinton refused to sign a balanced budget that the public had been clammoring for, the Republicans were blamed, not Clinton (as Reagan had been in the past).

The Federal government MUST be downsized before any other activities can take place.

The rest is either eaten up in administration costs or sent to \"more needy\" states.\n We need to institute L/C/C/S school taxing policies that eliminate Washington from participation in those programs and alow states to keep money raised in state for education to be kept in state for education.\n The only place in the Free World where there is a \"free lunch\" is in Washington where politicians have no problem giving your hard-earned money to some other state that they deem \"more needy\" than yours. emoticon_angry",

Since Washington is inherently ineffecient and funding isn't allocated back in the same proportion as it was collected, there will be some pain on the L/C/C/S levels until all of it is out of Washington cmpletely.\n For example, states like MI pay huge amounts of money to Washington earmarked for education, but only a small fraction of what was sent is returned. The rest is either eaten up in administration costs or sent to \"more needy\" states.\n We need to institute L/C/C/S school taxing policies that eliminate Washington from participation in those programs and alow states to keep money raised in state for education to be kept in state for education.\n The only place in the Free World where there is a \"free lunch\" is in Washington where politicians have no problem giving your hard-earned money to some other state that they deem \"more needy\" than yours. emoticon_angry\n\n \n I completely agree with you. I was just stating that the \"growing\" federal government problem seems to be a bipartisan problem. As far as I'm concerned, anything other than \"national defense\" should be done at the \"micro\" level. I'm sure that's a little drastic, but you get my point.",
