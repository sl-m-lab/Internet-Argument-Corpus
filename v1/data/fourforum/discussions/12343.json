That's over 2,000,000 homes!\n According to Statistics Canada, there has been an average of 289,200 home invasions annually over the last 5 years.\n Statistically, there are over 8,000 home invasions per day in North America\n According to Statistics U.S.A., there was an average of 3,600,000 home invasions annually between 1994 and 2000.\n Lightning-Associated Deaths -- United States, 1980-1995In the United States from 1980 through 1995, a total of 1318 deaths were attributed to lightning, (average: 82 deaths per year {range: 53-100 deaths}). Of the 1318 persons who died, 1125 (85%) were male, and 896 (68%) were aged 15-44 years.
