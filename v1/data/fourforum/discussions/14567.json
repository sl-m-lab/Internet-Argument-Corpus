   "The root cause of much income tax inequities is due to our progressive income tax rates.\n \n Increasing lower income earner's tax rates is politically unfeasible. It would also be economically and socially detrimental. Favoring higher income earners with tax rate reductions would be politically unfeasible and increase the federal deficit.\n \n It would be more feasible to reform our income tax system if we decreased our dependence upon income taxes; they are our overwhelmingly major source of federal revenue. I advocate to the extent we are able to incrementally shift our revenue sources from income taxes to a sales tax, we should do so.\n \n Of course, due to the regressive nature of sales taxes, it would be necessary to provide, (externally of the sales tax), some compensating provisions for lower income earners. Such a provision is certainly feasible but the U.S. Congress cannot in these times concur on anything positive and specific.\n \n [We have two major political parties. One leads in the wrong direction and the second cannot agree among themselves but paddle around in aimless circles and thus cannot lead].\n \n I believe that an acceptable rate of sales tax could not feasibly replace the entire revenue we derive from income taxes, (i.e. the \"fair tax\"). If I'm wrong, sales taxes could completely replace income taxes. If I'm correct, after some incremental step the sales tax rate will approach an unacceptable rate and the transfer of the tax sources will have to be halted or interrupted.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",

   "First off, many kudos to you for considering root causes! It's very refreshing in a climate where many seem to be solely concerned with immediate gratification to problems that've been growing for years!\n \n Of course, for any reforms to happen, the American people will surely need to Wake the XXXX Up!\n \n You said:\n \n \n[We have two major political parties. One leads in the wrong direction and the second cannot agree among themselves but paddle around in aimless circles and thus cannot lead]. \n\n \n & I tend to agree with this analysis.\n \n Although the root cause of this phenomenon is the American people.\n \n The American people seem to have fallen for the political marketing schemes resulting in a queasy quasi civic religion based on imaginary concepts. & rather than thinking for ourselves, rather than admitting 'The emperor has no clothes,' ... we follow ... sheeplike.\n \n You have identified the fact there are two major political parties (& the inertia that follows). I propose a hypothesis to explain:\n \n First off, no amount of logic, reason, or whatever can budge a faith (political, religious or otherwise) consciously or unconsciously based on a fallacy.\n \n There seems to be at least two serious mistakes in thinking leading to this inertia. The naturalistic fallacy, is the leap from is to ought - that is, the tendency to believe that what is natural is good; that what is, ought to be. \n \n The other is the moralistic fallacy & is the opposite of the naturalistic fallacy. It refers to the leap from ought to is, the claim that the way things should be is the way they are. This is the tendency to believe that what is good is natural; that what ought to be, is. Sometimes called the reverse naturalistic fallacy.\n \n Political conservatives tend to favor the naturalistic fallacy while political liberals tend to favor the moralistic fallacy.\n \n Unfortunately, neither speaks about what simply IS. This makes it difficult to get to the point where you can even identify the problems much less get to the solutions. \n \n This is a BIG problem:\n \n \nIdentify the problem. &#8212; &#8220;What&#8217;s the real question we&#8217;re facing here?&#8221;\n Define the context. &#8212; &#8220;What are the facts and circumstances that frame this problem?&#8221;\n Enumerate choices. &#8212; &#8220;What are our most plausible three or four options?&#8221;\n Analyze options. &#8212; &#8220;What is our best course of action, all things considered?&#8221;\n List reasons explicitly. &#8212; &#8220;Let&#8217;s be clear: Why we are making this particular choice?&#8221;\n Self-correct. &#8212; &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s look at it again. What did we miss?&#8221; \n\n \n What happened to a 'Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth'?\n \n Has it perished?",

   "blah blah blah mumbo jumbo. All nonsensensical talk and no action.\n \n The above post fits perfectly the definition of acute ms (mental masturbation). But, wait a moment! every post in this forum is indeed a 'masturbative' act, mine included :( Mine are shorter though, premature ... perhaps? ;)\n \n \n mental celibacy anyone?\n\n \n sigh.\n \n I'm strongly resisting the urge to tell you to 'go XXXX yourself' because it would be - rather than me 'letting off steam' the implication (sadly), would be for me to wonder 'who else would want to?' \n \n & I believe this is how the concept of the 'mercy XXXX' was first conceived.\n \n bitheway there are drugs available for the premature thingie.
