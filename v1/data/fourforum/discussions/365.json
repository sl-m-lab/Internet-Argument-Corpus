   "Hollywood actors are standing up against blacklisting. Sean Penn is sueing for loosing a job after he protested against a war with Iraq. Jessica Lange is speaking out against blacklisting. \n \n My response: too bad. When does taking the moral high ground ever come cheap? If your going to fight for something worthing fighting for, do you expect it to come easy? Just more proof of the Hollywood true-ism that \"Hollywod will turn man into a sissy and woman into a hore.\"\n \n I recall the non-violence protest of Ghandi. When Indians were beaten with clubs, they did not cry foul and hired a lawyer, they stood back up and took more of the beating. So Mr. Sean Penn, how much do you really believe in not fighting this war?",
