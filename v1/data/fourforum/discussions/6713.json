   "OK, gang. I've been remeniscing lately about the annual vacations my family and I used to take when I was a kid. We would pack up the station wagon and drive up to St. Regis Falls, NY at the northern end of the Adirondack Mountains. My grandparents owned a trailer with an addition and it was some of the best times in my life. I also remember going through the villages of Goveneur, Potsdam, and Nicholsville, NY enroute to the trailer. One year, we'd go to the St. Lawrence Seaway, another year, we'd take the ferry to Burlington, VT; and the last year (1978) we went to North Pole at Whiteface Mountain in Lake Placid, NY. What were some of your fondest memories?",

   "At what age range are you thinking of? My family never did much traveling. We went to Branson, Mo one year when I was 6. Then my mom took me to Las Vegas for my 15th birthday becasue that was the year (or a year after) they built the Star Trek The Expierence. The next closest thing to a trip that I took was to Fort Worth, Texas for a Youth Mission Trip through my church to build a house. But my fondest memory deals with an event from my Senior year of high school when I was 18 and it didn't invlove a trip or me being a kid (although I don't smoke, that's when I could legally purchase them.) It also didn't involve my home family except for encouragement and help. So before I bother to get descriptive, what is the age range you are refering to and does it need to invlove a trip and/or the family?",

   "It doesn't matter what age. It could be anything. I'll be posting other life experiences here, so no, age doesn't matter, nor the experiences.\n In that case, probibly my fondest memory came during my senior year of high school when I was 18. From late late October to late(r) January. I was involved with my high school performance of Fiddler On The Roof. I was not a main charicter but that was really the only time during that year that I really felt like I was a part of something. I was also on the yearbook staff and did the story for it. So I remember the rehearsals (and the bloopers) and how someone commented to the local paper for the story on that that it was turning out to be a lot like the movie. Then we razzed him about that. I learned about center of gravity first hand during rehearsals of the \"To Life\" number. We would have to move tables out of the way with our glasses and I stacked some up too high together and they would get off balanced and fall to the floor and then I got razzed about that. I also grew my own beard for it. It was my first beard, but I was told that out of the entire cast, I looked the most Jewish. But I had a great coat that the costume department ordered for me and everyone said that I looked liked the villiage pimp. What makes it funnier were that there were some daughters (played by high school students as well (there were also elementary school students involved)) who were not with any family unit. They were called the villiage prostitutes. Also, the girl who was my wife also had a nephew who was about (if I remember correctly) 4 years old. The youngest cast member who quickly became known as the cute kid was (playing the part of) a son of mine.\n Of course, probibly because of this, I got to know more of the under classmen then those in my own graduating class, which made it weird the next year when I went on to college and found myself as the baby in most of my classes. Anyway, that's my sappy (I mean) fondest memory. There is way more that I could say on this but that would be making this quite possibly my longest post. And I don't want to make this longer than my post I put up in the General forum because then reading this would just be a bad memory. So I'll stop now.",

   "In 1989, I was a member of the University at Buffalo Jazz Ensemble. In late March of that year, we went by chartered coach to Southeastern Pennsylvania for the Musicfest Competition at the Valley Forge Convention Center. I remember the clinics that were given by top shelf musicians such as the late Tommy Tedesco, Stu Hamm, and Steve Smith. There were concerts by Flautist Jimmy Walker, Steve Smith and Vital Information, and The USAF Jazz Ensemble. We were scheduled to perform that Sunday, so we had three whole days of R&R. I'll tell you. As a musician, I loved it! BTW, we placed fourth out of twelve in our category. Not bad, eh?",

   "My absolutely fondest memories involve undulation! I'll keep them to myself!\n \n On a vacation to the Gulf Coast (we went just about every summer through childhood) my sister and brother (younger/older) went crabbing on the end of what was the longest pedestrian pier on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The pier terminated in a gazebo looking structure over a quarter mile from the beach where the water was still only a few feet deep. It had a roof and handrail, bench seating all around and it was quite comfortable despite the sun.\n \n We took crabbing nets and about a pound of bacon and went crabbing. It wasn't too long until we had filled the small cooler with crabs. My brother walked back to the Buena Vista across the highway and procured a large box, something like what a clothes drier would have fit into. The hotel manager told my brother they would steam the crabs for us if we caught enough to bother with.\n \n We crabbed on and on for a few more hours and eventually had live crabs piled nearly to the top of the box. There must have been two or three hundred crabs in the box.\n \n You can imagine what happened when my brother and I lifted the box...the bottom (now soaked from water draining off the crabs) fell out, the crabs scurried in all directions toward the edge of the platform, my sister screamed long and loud and we all three jumped up on the bench seats. Naturally, my brother and I laughed at my sister for screaming until the last crab disappeared over the edge.",

   "I have a bunch of good memories (one of the few benefits of growing older), but one from Christmas in 1943 stands out for me. I was 9 years old and my greatest wish was a bicycle, but the only ones available were the \"Victory Bikes\" which were scarce, expensive and and poor quality. I had given up on a bike when I walked into my grandmother's living room that Xmas day (my Dad was overseas in the Army), but there sat the most beautiful bike I have ever seen. My Mother had bought it at Mr. Metcalf's Second Hand Store for $35 (a lot back then). She had put it on lay-a-way and spent months paying it out for Christmas. A family friend had painted it a shinny black. I kept that bike for many years and rode it to meet my Dad when he came back from Belgium in 1945.\n Dono",

   "I remember by first duck hunt, Cajun style...homemade decoys, homemade boat, homemade paddles, homemade duck calls and a handful of really nice overunder shotguns. As the excitement built that early morning in the shed, fixing the decoys and cleaning the guns, listening to ages old stories from when my daddy and his Cajun friend hunted before, I just couldn't wait to get to the blinds I'd been told about where ducks will land on the end of your gun barrel if you be still enough. I just couldn't imagine my daddy in such rustic surroundings as a shivering cold duck blind with nothing but a hand warmer similar to the one I'd been given. We were bundled up from head to foot and my brother and I had on huge life jackets cinched up tight enough to keep my arms from moving much. Somehow, I knew I would not get to shoot any of the guns.\n \n Here I was, Peter and the wolf style, going after those deadly ducks with the greatest of all duck hunters (the Cajun) and my dad; and they're not gonna let me shoot? But we brought four shotguns!\n \n As we slid between cypress trees and their knees I could hear the paddles dripping as they were gently removed from the water at each stroke. My dad and the Cajun knew how to sneak slowly through the water even if they might have known I was freezin' my ninnies off. They had instructed us boys not to talk and were following that rule themselves and you could have heard every drop of water that got slung on my rainparka and dripped right into my boot.\n \n We went through two places where my dad and the Cajun had to get out of the boat in their waders and pull the boat, with us in it, through a shallow spot in what they kept saying was part of the path that Vasco de Gama used. I remember wondering if my feet were going to fall off when I jumped out of the boat. I was freezing and still couldn't picture my dad putting up with this for longer than a few minutes.\n \n They kept whispering, \"We're almost there, boys.\" as the water in my boot began to crystalize. Then finally after a flicker of light from a distance, we headed to the wooded shore of a small moonlit lagoon and came upon what looked at first to be a boat pier. As my eyes adjusted, I could see why my daddy wasn't worried about the weather. We were tied up to a spacious heated blind on the deck of a darkened houseboat inside of which was a full bar and grille, food, bunks, toilets and an old couple that acted as cook and caretaker, a potbelly stove and two dogs. Yessir! That Cajun surely knew how to hunt ducks!\n \n They threw some decoys out on the dark water, sat out on the deck through sunrise and a few minutes beyond. The Cajun cut loose with some unassisted duck calls using only his lips and hands, the ducks started tryin' to land right in front of the house boat and my daddy and the Cajun shot 'em dead. The caretaker and his wife cleaned 'em, cooked 'em and we ate like royalty around the potbelly stove.\n \n My daddy told us boys not to say anything to Momma about the cook.",
