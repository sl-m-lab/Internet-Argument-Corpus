   "Assault weapons? first of all, what are assault weapons? Traditionally, it has meant a selective fire weapon (one capable of full, burst, and semi-automatic fire.) According to current legal definition, though, a semiautomatic weapon (one that fires a single round with every time you pull the trigger) can be legally called an assault weapon if it has 1) a removeable magazine, and any 2 of the following: \n \n a grenade launcher\n a bayonet lug\n a pistol grip\n or a folding stock. \n \n How is that an assault weapon?? I have no idea! why are they worried about semi-autos with pistol grips and folding stocks? Again, I have no idea. \n \n However, we'll assume for the moment that we are talking about a traditional assault rifle: a selective fire weapon along the lines of the FN FAL, the M16, AK-47, etc. \n Constitutionally, it doesn't even really matter. In the United States Constitution, we are guaranteed in the 2nd Amendment that:\n \n \"... the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n \n There's a key word there. \"Infringed.\" What does that word infringed mean? Webster's 1828 Dictionary defines it like this: \n \n 2. To break; to violate; to transgress; to neglect to fulfill or obey; as to infringe the law.\n 3. to destroy or hinder; as, to infringe efficacy.\n \n Under this definition, the right to own a firearm cannot even be hindered! Forget banning handguns. Forget banning assault weapons. The registration of firearms might not survive a Constitutional attack. \n \n So. It is UNCONSTITUTIONAL to ban assault weapons. (despite the fact that we basically have already done that.)",

   "Dave, \n \n Excellent, you've gotten the point. An assault weapon IS veritably useless for hunting. Not very sporting either. Nowadays, the caliber of military grade small arms is not to kill your opponent, but to wound him, for reasons I won't get into here.\n \n what assault weapons are you talking about? Remember, in my post above, I pointed out that there are rifles that are legally considered assault weapons that have no affiliation with what I assume you and I are talking about... a selective fire weapon, capable of at least single, and burst fire, but perhaps automatic as well. (Not every \"assault rifle\" is capable of fully automatic fire.) \n \n Since I have taken care to point out that there are Constitutional objections, and you have concurred, I'll assume you will also permit me to pretend that there is no 2nd Amendment. Just for pretend. Or maybe you and I live in Europe, where they don't have a right to carry. This way, the debate will be purely political and idealogical, not legal. \n \n So what are reasons we should own assault weapons? Particularly, assault rifles? Here are the reasons I personally would very much like to have citizens have ready access to and recieve training to use, assault weapons:\n \n 1. Militia. Every male between the ages of 18 and 41 is a part of the US militia, and every female discharged from active military duty. The reason why it was important to the Founders to provide for militias was because they just won a war with militas 11 years ago. They had proved that militias were vital for the defense of a \"free state.\" (You will find these acutal words in many of the State constitutions.) A \"free state\" as being opposed to one that is oppressed. Militias greatly help keep the government in line. If they thought there was a chance that the militia would oppose them, do you think they'd be so ready to trample our liberties? I think not. \n \n 2. Draft/Military service. Wouldn't it be wonderful if the Armed Forces could shave about 4 weeks of rifle training from the regular training period? (I'm unsure of the actual time spent training recruits to use their weapons.) To already have recruits who knew how to use the weapons they issue? I think so. To have them ready in that respect would facilitate arming rather quickly in the event of a sizeable threat to our nation. \n \n 3. Home Defense. Ok, this one may seem rather far fetched. But hey, during the riots in LA, the only ones able to stand against the mobs were some Chinese nationals who had a couple of AK-47s kicking around. I am unable to prove this claim, but I do remember hearing it. In such an event, a high-capacity weapon capable of a high rate of fire would be highly desireable. Aside from the mob idea, how would you, as a burgler, like to confront an angry sleepy homeowner with a G-3 in his hands? I wouldn't want to confront a homeowner that had a .22 target pistol in his hands, let alone a weapon of that sort. \n \n So there is my political case against the assault weapon ban. As if the legal one wasn't enough!",

It expires this year.\n \n The right to own arms is expressly clear. It shall not be infringed by Congress. The federal government is fully empowed to keep arms away from convicted fellons, it does not have the power to limit them from citizens.\n \n Those people who \"you don't know (what they may do)\"? When the government is effective enough to prevent crime or has the power to do so, then we no longer live in a free society. Keep in mind that free choice also allows a person to decide to break the law. It cuts both ways, you can not take away the choice to break laws and allow good citizens truely be free. The only governments through history that have been effective in crime prevention has been tyranically communist countries with extensive secret police. The present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime, they recall \"back in the day\" how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey. Yes they were safe from criminals, they were not safe from the secret police. The moment the secret police eyed you for real or imagined statistical probability of breaking a crime or become a political enemy, you dissapeared and no one ever saw you alive again.\n \n The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.\n \n The Firearms Act decided that sawed off shot guns and the Thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership. Early Supreme court DECISIONS support this. Early judicial opinion of the the Firearms act was based on the fact that the Thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd Amendment. The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army. Guess what? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later. So then, what does that mean? Judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd Amendment. What does that mean for the assault rifle ban? It means it is on shakey Constitutional ground.\n \n Some points I have for you:\n \n 1) Flash supressor? Argued by anti-gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position.\n \n Completely false. Flash hiders can hide flash from the target. It's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable:\n \n \"Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle, causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy.\" - http://www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htm\n \n Flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end. The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives.\n \n 2) Magazine limit? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives. Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims. True, but how often do you hear that? When it does happen it is national news. The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets:\n \n http://ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151\n \n The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next. They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity.\n \n So then. The ban on more than 10 bullets? It really does not do anything than give a false sense of security. If public policy productive and actally do something, then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce.\n \n 3) Bayonet? I can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons. Simly because they look dangerous I suppose is why they are banned. Will someone please let me know? Public policy should not be based on emotional reasons to be truely good and effective policy.\n \n 4) Pistol grip? They make controling an automatic weapon easier to sight on your target. Well then, if you rifle is semi-auto, then what reason is there to ban them?",

The present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime, they recall \"back in the day\" how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey. Yes they were safe from criminals, they were not safe from the secret police. The moment the secret police eyed you for real or imagined statistical probability of breaking a crime or become a political enemy, you dissapeared and no one ever saw you alive again.\n \n The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.\n \n The Firearms Act decided that sawed off shot guns and the Thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership. Early Supreme court DECISIONS support this. Early judicial opinion of the the Firearms act was based on the fact that the Thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd Amendment. The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army. Guess what? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later. So then, what does that mean? Judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd Amendment. What does that mean for the assault rifle ban? It means it is on shakey Constitutional ground.\n \n Some points I have for you:\n \n 1) Flash supressor? Argued by anti-gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position.\n \n Completely false. Flash hiders can hide flash from the target. It's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable:\n \n \"Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle, causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy.\" - http://www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htm\n \n Flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end. The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives.\n \n 2) Magazine limit? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives. Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims. True, but how often do you hear that? When it does happen it is national news. The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets:\n \n http://ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151\n \n The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next. They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity.\n \n So then. The ban on more than 10 bullets? It really does not do anything than give a false sense of security. If public policy productive and actally do something, then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce.\n \n 3) Bayonet? I can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons. Simly because they look dangerous I suppose is why they are banned. Will someone please let me know? Public policy should not be based on emotional reasons to be truely good and effective policy.\n \n 4) Pistol grip? They make controling an automatic weapon easier to sight on your target. Well then, if you rifle is semi-auto, then what reason is there to ban them?\n\n \n \n \n \n Thank you for your reply kelvin90701.\n \n I will give my thoughts on all of your points soon, for now, I am just leaving, so I will just inquire as to what you mean on part of your post. Specifically, the following:\n \n \n The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.\n \n \n \n So, what you are saying, is there is no constitutional protection given to the manufacturer of weapons. That is, it would be constitutional to ban the manufacture of guns? \n \n If so, would it still be OK, for an American citizen to buy any weapon that they would want from a foreign government/manufacturere, etc?\n \n Again, thank you for your response.\n \n -Dan",

Harrassment is not allowed. \n \n The sheriff knows that he needs to take care of problems like that right away, becasue he knows that if one of his deputies gets too out of hand and people start complaining, either he will be out a job, or his deputy will be found on a backroad somewhere either beat to a pulp or (worst case scenario) with a rifle shot to the head.\n \n When you bring in fgederal law enforcement, you take away accountability. If we don't like how the ATF operates, we don't have the option of just voting the head of the ATF out of office the next year. Federal agents have no real incintive to treat people decently and with respect because they will get on a plane and leave once their case is over. They have no need to fear public retaliation for their actions.\n \n \nRegarding Ruby Ridge. The general order given to snipers was to shoot any male with a firearm regardless of threat. Clearly an illegal order. For the snipers that did not shoot and disobeyed orders, one of thier testimony was very damning, it was to the effect, 'I knew my orders were illegal, my superiors wanted me to shoot, but I knew at the end of the day, it was going to be ME to explain my actions to a judge, not them.'\n \n Those same people who ordered the shooting at Ruby Ridge were at BOTH Elian \"rescue\" and Waco. There you have it, regardless of what opinion you have of Elian, Waco, or Ruby Ridge; tyrants are alive and well in our government.\n\n \n I agree with you completely. There was no justification for the actions of the Government in any of those cases. At the time, we didn;t really know what was going on at ruby ridge. All we knew was that some guy had holed up in his house and was refusing to surrender. Personally, I kind of categorised him as a \"survivalist wacko\" (which is actually an entirely different classification in my mind from either \"survivalist\" or \"wacko\").\n \n Even the Waco event, where they were dealing with \"religous wackos\" I feel was entireely unjustified, and that somebody in the ATF should have gone to prosin just for using such poor judgement. I rememebr seeing during the investigation pictures of the ATF agents loading up in the back of a cargo truck to raid the place. \n \n There was a reason that the key law enforcement was supposed to be the local guys. It is becasue they HAVE to treat their citizens with respect, or they risk the loss of their jobs. A local guy is also a lot more likely to know what kind of people you will be dealing with. \n \n Just because the federal government has the option of taking jurisdiction in federal cases does not mean that they have to, and for a lot of years they didn't. \n \n You have to wonder what would have happened if the local sheriff had gone out to the compound in Waco and knocked ont he door with a few of his deputies, rather than a bunch of JBT's doing a raid. We already knwo that the Davidians had dealings with the sheriff, they would have had to in order to get their FFL.",
