   "gravity bends space, which is why it has an effect on light. The problem you have is that you're trying to apply Newtonian laws of motion to relativistic situations. Matter that passes the event horizon of a black hole is NOT travelling at the speed of light, and the nature of the relativistic equations is that it takes more and more force to accelerate a body the closer is gets to the speed of light, and in fact no body with mass can ever reach that speed. Hope that helps.",

Either I'm getting my facts really mixed up, or something is missing from the equation.\n\n \n \n Another item: It is not impossible (relativistically or classically) to travel faster than the speed of light. It is only impossible to travel AT the speed of light.\n \n Relativistically, Joe Bennet offers an excellent solution to your question as well. But Einstein never declared that things could not go faster than light only they could never reach the speed of light. Time \"dilates\" that is expands and slows down as you approach the speed of light. Once you get to the speed of light, time actually stops. If that is the case then one could never expend the necessary energy to get one past the speed of light barrier. However, if you can somehow jump over the speed of light or simply come into existence as a faster than light particle.....\n \n That is another story.\n \n EF",

There are a number of theories on faster than light particles.\n \n Pandion once pointed out to me that I was in error claiming proof of them. I was in error and he was correct. They are hypothesized and there is evidence to support them in that they are used quite frequently in quantum equations. They are called tachyons.
