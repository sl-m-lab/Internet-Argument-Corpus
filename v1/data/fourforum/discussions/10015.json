   "\n Four women sentenced over attack on man\n Victim had made advances toward homosexuals in New York\n Updated: 6:10 a.m. ET June 15, 2007 \n NEW YORK - Four lesbians convicted of assaulting a man who was stabbed after he made advances toward one of them were sentenced Thursday amid screams and weeping to prison terms ranging from 3 1/2 to 11 years.\n More than two dozen court officers ringed the courtroom as Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Edward McLaughlin pronounced the sentences, which were usually punctuated by a moan, a wail or a comment of disbelief.\n The judge made clear that he believed the women, ages 19 to 25 and all from Newark, N.J., were guilty. He said a surveillance tape of the fight was \"damning\" and \"I believe that but for the videotape there would have been an acquittal.\"\n \n The judge sentenced Patreese Johnson, 20, to 11 years in prison. Johnson admitted she had a knife and is seen on the videotape swinging it at the victim, Dwayne Buckle, who has called the incident \"a hate crime against a straight man.\"\n Renata Hill, 25, was sentenced to eight years by the judge, who said \"she's seen re-instigating the event (fight) when it's over.\" He said that if it's true Buckle was stabbed in the second flare-up, \"she bears some responsibility.\"\n The judge called Venice Brown, 19, \"an aggressor who ran after the victim,\" and he sentenced her to five years in prison. He said the videotape showed her \"punching and pulling\" Buckle during the fight.\n Terrain Dandridge, 20, was the only defendant \"who took some responsibility, finally, which is what nobody else did,\" the judge said in sentencing her to the least harsh prison term, 3 1/2 years.\n associated Press \n\n \n Looks like a hate crime to me. emoticon_wow",

My suspicions were correct: you cut out a part of the article.\n \n Here's what JP cut out, everyone: \nVisibly upset\n While all the defendants wept visibly and audibly, Hill sobbed and screamed and collapsed to the floor after the sentencing and was lifted by court officers and carried out of the courtroom.\n \n Three other women who were in the group previously pleaded guilty to attempted assault and were sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation.\n \n The four sentenced Thursday were convicted April 18 after assaulting Buckle, who had made advances at one of the seven as they walked past him outside the Independent Film Center in Greenwich Village on Aug. 18, 2006.\n \n Johnson testified at trial that her group told Buckle they were not interested and he became loud and rude, called them names and threw a cigarette at them while saying that having sex with him would make them straight. She said the fight started after Buckle pushed and shoved them.\n Buckle, 29, testified that he was in a hospital for five days and in bed at home for a month after surgery for a lacerated liver and stomach. He said he also suffered cuts, bruises, scratches and an eye injury in the attack.\n \n A lawyer for Hill, Susan Tipograph, called the verdict disappointing. She said the women were defending themselves from an \"abusive, homophobic\" Buckle. She and the other defense lawyers say they will appeal.\n \n Buckle, of Queens, is a movie audio-video engineer and an independent filmmaker. He says he was trying to sell some of his DVDs on the street when the fight started.\n \n He apparently was not in court for the sentencing.\n \n \n\n \n Note the bolded part. The stabbing and such was not called for, and they are serving their time for their crime, but it seems rather obvious that it is not a hate crime, and possibly provoked.\n \n \n By the way JP, did you not say in a post in the Abortion forums (in an attack on me): \nYou will find a decided lack of honesty when dealing with particular people in this forum, AA. You have just seen a good example of one. Taking a biblical quote out of context is a favorite tactic of many atheists. :xcensored\n\n Thus, as you attacked me for something out of context, and you now have taken quotes out of context here, that sure sounds like hypocrisy to me.\n \n So now I say - Taking quotes out of context is a favorite tactic of many anti-gay posters :xcensored .",

Do you think that she possibly had a vested interest in lying? If you were her, wouldn't you try to paint the guy as more than an annoyance in order to justify the attack?\n \n But, let's continue with the facts and not a vested participant's statement.\n \"The judge made clear that he believed the women, ages 19 to 25 and all from Newark, N.J., were guilty. He said a surveillance tape of the fight was \"damning\" and \"I believe that but for the videotape there would have been an acquittal.\"\n \n The article goes on describing the video of the attack and the women's part in it. \n \n\n Renata Hill, 25, was sentenced to eight years by the judge, who said \"she's seen re-instigating the event (fight) when it's over.\" He said that if it's true Buckle was stabbed in the second flare-up, \"she bears some responsibility.\"\n The judge called Venice Brown, 19, \"an aggressor who ran after the victim,\" and he sentenced her to five years in prison.

At least one pursued the man and one reinstigated a second confrontation. Four additional \"women\" admitted to attempted assault and plea bargained a reduced sentence. When confronted with the tape, another assailant took responsibility and received a lesser sentence.\n Those are the indisputable facts.\n SP looks for things to nitpick because that's her nature. She and I don't care for each other. I expected better from you, Kronus. :xcensored",

I think most older people understand that you need to let things go when they don't matter. A stranger coming on to you and insulting you....it just doesn't matter, and it's not worth starting a fight. The same is true of road rage incidents. There will always be strangers who do annoying things, and we need to let them go and not escalate incidents into tragedies. If someone cuts you off on the highway, you let it go and stay away from that driver. If someone comes on to you on the street, or says something that insults you, you let it go and walk on. Had the women simply walked on and let it go, no one would have been injured, and no one would have been sentenced to prison.\n \n This is one of those times when people reacted with rage and foolishly caused the incident to escalate, creating a terrible outcome.",

A trained ape could have found the article in its entirety with minimal effort.:xcensored \n\n That is why you post a LINK! :xbanghead :xbanghead You did not, and instead of even snipping the important parts (you know the ones that show it was not a hate crime?)\n \n As to your \"source\", you provided \"Associated Press\". Wow, that's impressive.:xbanghead You deliberately didn't post a link until several people asked for it, showing that you were hoping people wouldn't want to take the time to investigate.\n \n \n\n Now, let's look at your selective quoting. You quote one of the assailant's account of the encounter. Do you think that she possibly had a vested interest in lying?

He said a surveillance tape of the fight was \"damning\" and \"I believe that but for the videotape there would have been an acquittal.\" \n\n And holy $hit, guess what!!!! They were charged with the attack!!!! :xbanghead :xbanghead Can you not see that his statement says that they were guilty of attacking the person? Do you really think that we are arguing that they should not be charged? If you do, there is no hope for you. They are clearly guilty (and have been punished), but not of a hate crime. :xbanghead :xbanghead \n \n \n \n\n The article goes on describing the video of the attack and the women's part in it. \n \n And further down \n \n \n So, there were a total of SEVEN assailants. At least one pursued the man and one reinstigated a second confrontation. Four additional \"women\" admitted to attempted assault and plea bargained a reduced sentence. When confronted with the tape, another assailant took responsibility and received a lesser sentence.\n Those are the indisputable facts.\n SP looks for things to nitpick because that's her nature. She and I don't care for each other. I expected better from you, Kronus. :xcensored\n\n \n Yes, those are the undisputable facts. I am not nitpicking, I am pointing out that THOSE ARE THE FACTS, and your claims of a hate crime is NOT A FACT or anywhere close. Got it?:xcensored",

As I said earlier, it's indeed a crime to stab someone and physically attack someone, and the fact that someone was harassing and being offensive does not justify someone stabbing them. But that's not the same as a bias crime aimed at someone for being heterosexual.

But the awful act of stabbing the guy doesn't make this a bias crime. \n \n Bias crimes against heterosexuals can and apparently do happen on occasion, but as I see it, that's not what this crime was. Many women, of all sexual orientations, have secretly wanted to fight back and pound the #### out of men who come on to them and act like boors. Most of us don't actually do it, for good reasons.

The term seems to be a sort of play on the term \"Islamist\", often used to refer to radical Islam fundamentalists. Of course, never mind the fact that most all of these Christians who tend to put their beliefs into political action do so the same way everyone else in our country puts theirs into action--through legitimate democratic means such as voting for candidates and taking part in the political process, rather than suicide-bombing crowded marketplaces. And never mind that \"Islamist\" is a rather poor term, and so \"Christianist\" would also be.

The concept of domestic partnership was born out the realization that despite the fact that only an estimated 10% of American families are made up of a working husband, a stay-at-home wife, and children, our legal and social systems still provided benefits and protections based on that model. Domestic partners are unmarried couples (same sex or opposite sex) who live together and seek economic and non-economic benefits which are granted to their married counterparts. These benefits include things like health, dental and vision insurance, sickness and bereavement leave, accident and life insurance, death benefits, parental leave (for a child of your co-parent), housing rights and tuition reduction, and use of recreational facilities. In the early to mid-1990's the desire to have the official recognition of marriage accorded to their relationships reemerged and many couples once again began applying for marriage licenses and suing their states when their requests were denied.\n http://mit.edu/thistle/www/v13/3/marriage.html\n \n\n \n \n\n Nope.

Created by Lightspeed Online Research, the survey was of 1,000 gay men and lesbians randomly drawn from a pool of 700,000 general panelists.\n \n Marans, of MindShare, says a key finding was that gay income levels reflect those of the general population. They are not above average, as was often indicated in earlier studies. They also found that the most widely viewed programs are: \"Will & Grace,\" \"XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy,\" \"Friends,\" \"CSI,\" and \"XXXXX As Folk.\" \n http://www.thegully.com/essays/gay_mundo2/wilke/040528_gay_US_census.html\n \n\n \n Note that earlier studies often indicated an above-average income which is consistent with what I had posted. \n \n Try this out:\n http://www.gaydemographics.org/USA/PUMS/nationalintro.htm\n 1999 statistics\n The average income for same sex household is $72,122\n 5% are below poverty level\n 22.3% have household incomes over $93,000.\n \n \n\n n 2005, the median annual household income according to the US Census Bureau was determined to be $46,326,[3] similar to that of Canada which was roughly $41,510 (USD) in the year 2000.......12.7% fell below the federal poverty threshold[7] while the bottom 20% earned less than $19,178.[8] \n \n\n Poverty rate for families: \n \n\n The poverty rate and number of families in poverty increased from 9.6 percent and 7.2 million in 2002 to 10.0 percent and 7.6 million in 2003. The corresponding numbers for unrelated individuals in poverty in 2003 were 20.4 percent and 9.7 million (not different from 2002).\n Average income for married couples \n http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/002484.html\n \n\n \n It looks like the US census supports my statements. emoticon_xagree \n The average same sex household income is higher than the general population's household income by almost $30k.\n The poverty rate is less than 1/2 of the rest of the population.\n \n Next!",

   "And on the issue of cost...\n \n The Numbers Are In: Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage Would Mean Millions for NY\n June 7, 2007 \n \n Los Angeles, CA - New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr. issued a study on Tuesday finding that the legalization of marriage for same-sex partners could yield $142 million in economic benefits to New York City.\n \n The report, Love Counts: The Economic Benefits of Marriage Equality for New York, concluded that the $142 million largely would be generated in the three years immediately following enactment of legislation and would be derived from the spending of residents and visitors on their weddings, along with the spending of their out-of-town guests.http://www.connexion.org/newsstory.cfm?id=10020\n \n Forbes magazine recently calculated that 546,000 gay and lesbian couples nationwide would get married if they were legally allowed to do so. Of those, 464,000 couples would have a traditional wedding ceremony with a reception. Forbes then broke down the costs associated with such a wedding and found that these marriages would generate $16.8 billion in revenue for businesses associated with the wedding industry. Of that figure, we estimate that California would reap $3 billion. The number of new jobs created would be in the thousands. \n \n A study co-authored by the Williams Project, a think tank at UCLA School of Law, and the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, found that the California state budget would see a net gain of about $25.6 million annually if marriage equality were legalized. This figure was calculated by adding the state's increase in sales tax revenue and its savings from reduced enrollment in means-tested public benefit programs (since many recipients who qualify for such programs as individuals would no longer qualify when being assessed by their household income). http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid21007.asp",

Primarily because I don't think you fully comprehend the fact that it speaks volumes to YOU and not me.\n I AM consistent.\n I am saying that if you call seeking marriage benefits as \"greed\", then it is \"greed\" for both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Across the board.\n YOU are the one who is hypocritical in pretending the motives of heterosexuals who seek benefits are \"pure as the driven snow\", while gays are just about the \"greed\".\n \n And it's interesting to note that you completely failed to respond to anything I actually said. You quoted my argument, but then completely ignored it.\n \n \n \nActually, I posted it to show that there were studies which came to the opposite conclusion of yours, while the one stated that there was no difference.\n\n And as I already explained, with again no response from you, those studies are from ADVERTISING groups within companies trying to evaluate the nature of their target customer.\n They are NOT indicative of all gays, as you claim.\n Those studies \"which came to the opposite conclusion of mine\" are not covering ALL gays.\n \n \n \nNot satisfied, I dug into the US Census and found the links to the last two references that demonstrated that gay households have higher income levels than the general population. Since there isn't a Census category for \"normal, heterosexual\", I had to use the composite.\n\n And again, you fail to note that your ONE study which compared INDIVIDUAL gays DISPROVES your claims as you try to claims gays, by focusing on households, are getting more pay.\n \n I've already pointed out the deficiencies in your attempt to compare apples and oranges, to say the golden delicious is of higher income.\n And your response is the following...\n \n \n \nAh, the spin meistering begins. Maybe I should have specified gay males living with red-headed males with moles on their left cheek? Would that have been specific enough for you? \n\n Ahhh yes. Such a mind-numbingly ineffectual and impotent response.\n Mock me if you will, but your original argument is ####.\n I just explained that your argument was ####.\n And in response, all you do is attempt to mock me.\n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nEver hear of the term \"fair and balanced\"? Nah, I thought not. emoticon_rolleyes \n\n It's funny how you pretend that was an effort at \"fair and balanced\", when the truth is obvious that it was anything but that.\n You quoted the one article ONLY because it demonstrated that there were previous studies which claimed \"gays\" had a higher income.\n You completely ignored THE ACTUAL CONTENTS of that study in your analysis and conclusion.\n \n Yeah. That's \"fair\" and \"balanced\". emoticon_xgood \n \n \n \nI compared same sex households to all households. It's unfortunate that the US Census bureau doesn't have a box that says \"limp wristed male\" or \"carpetmuncher\", so that we could identify individuals. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Ahh yes. Again with the mocking and slurs as you completely ignore the argument.\n AGAIN you ignore my arguments on the issue.\n \n No matter. I'll repeat them since you obviously cannot hack them...\n --------------------------------------------------\n \n Again, the DISCRIMINATION is economic based, so when we seek EQUALITY for benefits YOU already have, you denounce it as \"greed\".\n By that standard, straights who ALREADY HAVE these benefits, and who LEGISLATED these benefits should be accused OF THE SAME GREED.\n \n We want equality.\n Seeking a respite from economic disadvantage is not \"greed\".\n It's damn greedy of straights to insist that gays, who pay the same taxes as straights, should not receive THE SAME BENEFITS.\n \n THAT is greed!\n \n ....\n \n Notice it states SAME SEX HOUSEHOLDS, which could mean two heterosexual male room-mates.\n We're talking about gay individual income as compared to straight individual income.\n Trying to compare households just hides the fact that often both work, because the BENEFITS straights get are not included for gay couples, so they HAVE to work so both are covered.",

What followed was a firestorm of people stating that AIDS in Africa and Asia isn't spread by gays today. That's a dishonest attempt to deflect the debate away from the original statement.

   "\n For example, a while back I stated that the HIV spread in the US initially was predominantly through gays. What followed was a firestorm of people stating that AIDS in Africa and Asia isn't spread by gays today. That's a dishonest attempt to deflect the debate away from the original statement. \n\n Just to set the record straight, that's the position you retreated to. Your original position was more along the line of \"We wouldn't have AIDS in America if it weren't for gays\", or something to that effect. Once enough people demonstrated the stupidity of that stance you shifted to the above statement, pretending that it's what you said originally.",

   "I said \"One of the wealthiest segments of our population are gays.\" Perhaps I should have used the term \"minorities\" in place of segment, then it would have been less subjective. The term wealthy segment is probably too nebulous. The claim is accurate, none-the-less. I just should have realized that in this forum, everything is subjected to various individual interpretations and attempts to subvert the discussion away from the facts. \n\n \n I have not found people here trying to subvert the discussion. I have found people sometimes disagreeing with each other, but that's what a discussion forum is for. \n \n I do think it is inaccurate to say that gays are \"one of the wealthiest segments of our population.\" Gay people, like heterosexuals, span the range of incomes and wealth. Unlike some minority groups, gay people are not clustered at the bottom. Nor are they clustered at the top, as your statement appears to suggest.",

   "Pardon my frustration. I get tired of being called a bigot, a Christonazi, liar and other insults, so I will, occasionally retaliate in kind. \n\n Did anybody even call you a \"bigot\" or \"Christonazi\" here?\n And as for \"liar\", if you want to stop being called a liar then stop telling lies.\n Stop inaccurately proclaiming that the motives of people is \"greed\" when the truth is that it is EQUALITY. That would be a lie. No two ways about it.\n \"Liar\" is just accurate. Not a slur like you were handing out...\n \n \n \nI've had this conversation before. I said \"One of the wealthiest segments of our population are gays.\" Perhaps I should have used the term \"minorities\" in place of segment, then it would have been less subjective. The term wealthy segment is probably too nebulous. The claim is accurate, none-the-less.\n\n Funny how your own article STILL disproves this claim...\n And the best you have in response is to shift the subject to HOUSEHOLDS. And that has been exposed as facetious for a myriad of reasons...\n \n \n \nWhen I stated that the gay marriage movement was economic-based and that there was hypocricy in their calling the rich greedy, they tried to deflect the debate to heterosexual marriage and its greed. Another dishonest attempt to change the debate and deflect it away from their true agenda.\n\n Ahhh. Your obfuscation continues.\n 1) You WERE responded to REPEATEDLY that the driving force behing the gay marriage movement was EQUALITY and not \"economic-based\".\n Oh wait. You actually used the phrase \"chasing the benjamins\", which I guess you are now pretending means \"economic-based\" instead of the obvious interpretation of greed.\n There was no \"deflection\" of the debate. You were met square on, and you continued with your false claim despite being corrected many times.\n 2) And it was not a \"deflection\" of the debate at all.\n It was to point out that your classification of greed was a FALSE one. To demonstrate that YOU had a \"hypocrisy\" (or is it only okay when you point it out???) when you tried to claim that gay rights was about greed, but then refused to acknowledge that EXISTING STRAIGHT RIGHTS would also be about \"greed\" by the same classification system.\n \n The only \"dishonesty\" here is yours in trying to rewrite history and pretend that other people's motives are something other than what they ACTUALLy are.",
