Obama and others in the government are pushing for BP to suspend their dividend until they can be sure that BP is going to have enough cash on hand to deal with the spill. The British government, on the other hand, is pushing BP to continue paying its dividend because BP stock and its traditional dividend is the backbone of most British pension systems. \n \n I am having trouble coming up with numbers, but a lot fo the estimates I have seen claim that about 35% of British pension funds would go under if BP stopped paying its dividend for 2 quarters.
