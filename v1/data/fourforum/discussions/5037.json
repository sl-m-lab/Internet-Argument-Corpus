   "It is being reported that the U.S. has a $7.6 trillion dollar deficit. National Debt. \n \n However, $1.7 trillion dollars of Social Security Trust Fund monies are added in as an asset into the Budget. \n \n In reality, there is not a $7.6 trillion deficit, we actually have an additional $1.7 trillion dollar deficit debt on top of that. Add the $1.7 trillion to the already $7.6 trillion and the actual U.S. Debt is a whopping - $9.3 trillion dollar debt, the largest in U.S. history. \n\n \n http://www.dldewey.com/feb05.htm",
