   "Where I live, I just heard on tv a house being moved because politicians seizing the land via eminent domain, then also today as well, I read, same town is now using eminent domain to seize another property because they want to make \"better\" things for the communty.\n \n It's so sad. The US supreme Court Justices totally missed the mark on \"everyone is created equal\". \n \n You know on the new currency, on my ten dollar bill and 20 dollar bill, in pinkish letter you noticed \"we the people\" in which I firmly believe, but I know now, it's no longer \"we the people\" , it truly is \"we the government\".\n \n I hope one day no one in here fall's victim to the heartless, greedy government.\n \n Eminent domain for state necessity, like hospitals, roadway, ect., is understandable but to tell an american citizen, that the greed for money is more valuable than they are as citizens.",
