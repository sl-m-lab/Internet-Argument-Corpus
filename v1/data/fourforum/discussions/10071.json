   "http://www.arn.org/blogs/index.php/literature/2007/05/\n \n Now that the opossum genome has been sequenced, both winners and losers have emerged. The main loser is the 'Genes-R-Us' school, who have argued that genes are the only really interesting components of the genome. This group is a loser because the \"vast majority of the opossum's genes are identical to other placental mammals\". Genes do not distinguish marsupials from placentals, but the non-coding elements (previously referred to as 'Junk DNA' are distinctly different. Thus, \"most of the genetic difference between marsupials and placental mammals comes from non-coding sequences, not proteins.\"\n \n The Evo-Devo community appears to consider itself a winner. The new research \"is bound to make the [evolutionary developmental biology] community very happy, because they've been saying all along that it's the regulation of genes that is what's driving the changes that we see in the evolution of animals.\" Some of this confidence is, however, misplaced: it is one thing to say that gene regulation is the key to understanding the difference between placentals and marsupials, but linking this to origins is theory-laden. The data does not speak for itself but is interpreted, often through an evolutionary filter.\n \n The ID community is also a winner. ID scholars have long been sceptical of the genetic reductionism displayed by most evolutionary biologists, and have also been quick to recognise the functionality of much of the so-called Junk DNA. These scholars have much in common with evo-devo, but see the regulation system as an extraordinarily complex system that invites design inferences when considering origins.\n \n ID scholars will also welcome the recognition that marsupials are not primitive mammals: \"The study helps to erode a common misconception that marsupials are somehow an archaic or second-rate category of mammal. One scientist comments on the discovery of a gene that encodes for a unique form of T-cell receptor not found in placental mammals: this \"knocks that assumption on its head [. . .] It shows that they have a very sophisticated immune system, but one that's very different.\"\n \n I underlined a sentence above......so tell me....if the vast majority of the opposum's genes are identical to other placental mammals, where exactly is the evolution?????????",

So what does this do to the timeline?\n \n\n Not exactly. You are decades out of date. Scientists have recognized the role of gene expression under control of (variable) genetic regulation switches for quite some time. For example homeobox genes have been recognized since 1983 about a quarter of a century. But of course variations in homeobox genes themselves come about by NDS type mechanisms. Development processes are themselves evolved and by NDS mechanisms. The problem with your statement is that you are confusing various mechanisms for generating variation with what amounts to vitalism. Tis not so. And random molecular events happen rather often. Often enough that one can find them in volumes of less than 1 liter containing bacteria or viruses or even cultured metazoan cells.\n \n \n Either chimps and humans separated instantly as individuals by way of epigenetics, or it didn't happen at all.\n\n \n Well we can agree that \"it\" happened I suppose. Chimps and humans presumably have a common ancestor. But it certainly is unlikely to have happened instantly regardless of the mechanism given the fossil record since there are ape-like ancestors in our linage which are NOT apparently in the chimp linage and vice versa. If \"it\" happened instantly there would (and could) be NO intermediates between the the chimp/human common ancestor and the chimp linage or the human linage. And of course there are. And there is no reason to conclude that epigentics is the sole mechanism involve or even that it played a measurable role.\n \n You really are an uninformed debater are you not.

W. Nachman, S. N. Boyer, J. B. Searle and C. F. Aquadro\n Section of Genetics and Development, Biotechnology Building, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853\n \n The house mouse, Mus domesticus, includes many distinct Robertsonian (Rb) chromosomal races with diploid numbers from 2n = 22 to 2n = 38. Although these races are highly differentiated karyotypically, they are otherwise indistinguishable from standard karyotype (i.e., 2n = 40) mice, and consequently their evolutionary histories are not well understood. We have examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation from the control region and the ND3 gene region among 56 M. domesticus from Western Europe, including 15 Rb populations and 13 standard karyotype populations, and two individuals of the sister species, Mus musculus. mtDNA exhibited an average sequence divergence of 0.84% within M. domesticus and 3.4% between M. domesticus and M. musculus. The transition/transversion bias for the regions sequenced is 5.7:1, and the overall rate of sequence evolution is approximately 10% divergence per million years. The amount of mtDNA variation was as great among different Rb races as among different populations of standard karyotype mice, suggesting that different Rb races do not derive from a single recent maternal lineage. Phylogenetic analysis of the mtDNA sequences resulted in a parsimony tree which contained six major clades. Each of these clades contained both Rb and standard karyotype mice, consistent with the hypothesis that Rb races have arisen independently multiple times. Discordance between phylogeny and geography was attributable to ancestral polymorphism as a consequence of the recent colonization of Western Europe by mice. Two major mtDNA lineages were geographically localized and contained both Rb and standard karyotype mice. The age of these lineages suggests that mice have moved into Europe only within the last 10,000 years and that Rb populations in different geographic regions arose during this time.",

   "First, there was no claim made that the chromosome fusion was the event that caused speciation.\n\n \n **\n Really?! I've heard darwinists make that claim at least a million times, and as a matter of fact, I've never even found a reason to debate it with them until now. Always assumed (silly me) that when they spoke with such confidence about it, it could only come from knowing that such chromosome fusion was quite the regular thing in evolution. But this time a little doubt assailed my confidence in darwinist self-assurance, so I asked a simple question--give a number re the actual instances of chromsome fusion generating a new species, any kind of species, and mention some examples to go with the number.\n Your special friend Chemmy played the flaming idiot by acting as one who could legitimately turn that question into a demand for a full list of particular species generated by chromosomal fusion, along with their antecedents, stretching all the way back to the beginnings of life on earth!! I thought that he was just being deliberately moronic in order to evade a legitimate question that he thought might cloak an attack on his precious ideology, but then he was imbecilic enough to actually quote my words back to me as if there was anyway in the world what I actually said could correspond to his loopy interpretation. \n Just to cap off this lunacy, he then admitted that his snide and shirty response was truly because he had no intelligent, sensible, reasonable, mature and sane response to give, and when I asked him why he posted a \n the #### he did if that was the case, instead of simply staying silent, he made an astoundingly stupid and irrational response, above, to the effect that it was no more stupid of him to respond stupidly to a question for which he had no real answer, than it was for me to 'ask the experts' for a response to a legitimate question to which I did not know the answer in advance!!!!\n \n Louis Carroll must have known dozens like chemmy, or he would never have been able to create his \"Wonderland\". But I'm sick of trying to dialogue with people from that strange little world.\n \n \n\n If you read carefully, all that was said was that the fusion of chromosome 2 in humans demonstrates that the two genomes are not the same, as was asserted by SS.\n\n \n **\n All that was said by whom?!? I've been following the \"anthropoid to hominid\"\n debate for years, and the darwinist position has invariably been stated as RMNS--that is, an accidental chromsomal fusion mutation in an 'ape-like' creature generated/evolved a new, 'man-like' creature, which then, by NS, survived and multiplied, yadayadayada. Granted, a very Goldschmidtian[sp.?], anti-Darwinian, case of abrupt and robust (i.e., non-gradual, non-cumulative), \"hopeful monster\"-style evolution, but still RMNS. So, tell me, did you guys recently change your tune on this, when I wasn't paying attention?!?\n \n \n\n Second, you did ask for all species and then you denied that you had done so. Specifically, you asked \"how many species.\"\n\n \n **\n The words \"how many\" is a request for a number, not a list of names. I'\n d have been satisfied with something like, 'hundreds', 'thousands', or 'millions', with a short list of examples. That you are actually tryiong to back up chemmy's wackadoo interpretation shows that you are from the same \"Wonderland\" that he inhabits--the one where plain English can be misinterpreted to mean anythjing you wish it to mean, a la Humpty Dumpty.\n \n \n\n Please explain how You could be given a number that did not include \"all species.\" \n\n \n **\n Wow, you guys are so totally off the wall. You and your special friend deserve a room all to yourselves.\n \n \n \n\n The answer was that we don't know because the genome of every species has not been examined to that extent.\n\n \n **\n That answer is stupid because my question had nothing to do with the species you DO NOT KNOW about, but was clearly confined to the number of species that you DO KNOW about. Apparently, as per the Bush administration, that number is a matter of darwinian national security.\n \n \n\n Third, even though the event is relatively rare, there are many known examples of chromosome fusion in different species of a single genus.

Abstract below, full article at\n \n\n http://www.genome.org/cgi/reprint/12/11/1663\n \n \n Gene Content and Function of the Ancestral\n Chromosome Fusion Site in Human Chromosome\n 2q13-2q14.1 and Paralogous Regions\n Yuxin Fan, Tera Newman, Elena Linardopoulou, and Barbara J. Trask1\n Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA\n Various portions of the region surrounding the site where two ancestral chromosomes fused to form human\n chromosome 2 are duplicated elsewhere in the human genome, primarily in subtelomeric and pericentromeric\n locations. At least 24 potentially functional genes and 16 pseudogenes reside in the 614-kb of sequence\n surrounding the fusion site and paralogous segments on other chromosomes. By comparing the sequences of\n genomic copies and transcripts, we show that at least 18 of the genes in these paralogous regions are\n transcriptionally active. Among these genes are new members of the cobalamin synthetase W domain (CBWD)\n and forkhead domain FOXD4 gene families. Copies of RPL23A and SNRPA1 on chromosome 2 are\n retrotransposed-processed pseudogenes that were included in segmental duplications; we find 53 RPL23A\n pseudogenes in the human genome and map the functional copy of SNRPA1 to 15qter. The draft sequence of the\n human genome also provides new information on the location and intron-exon structure of functional copies of\n other 2q-fusion genes (PGM5, retina-specific F379, helicase CHLR1, and acrosin). This study illustrates that the\n duplication and rearrangement of subtelomeric and pericentromeric regions have functional relevance to human\n biology; these processes can change gene dosage and/or generate genes with new functions.\n",

   "Posted for information purposes. Interesting.\n =============================\n \n \n Science 29 June 2007:\n Vol. 316. no. 5833, p. 1836\n DOI: 10.1126/science.316.5833.1836\n P\n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n News Focus\n EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY:\n Relative Differences: The Myth of 1%\n Jon Cohen\n \n Genomewise, humans and chimpanzees are quite similar, but studies are showing that they are not as similar as many tend to believe\n In a groundbreaking 1975 paper published in Science, evolutionary biologist Allan Wilson of the University of California (UC), Berkeley, and his erstwhile graduate student Mary-Claire King made a convincing argument for a 1% genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees. \"At the time, that was heretical,\" says King, now a medical geneticist at the University of Washington, Seattle. Subsequent studies bore their conclusion out, and today we take as a given that the two species are genetically 99% the same.\n \n But truth be told, Wilson and King also noted that the 1% difference wasn't the whole story. They predicted that there must be profound differences outside genes--they focused on gene regulation--to account for the anatomical and behavioral disparities between our knuckle-dragging cousins and us. Several recent studies have proven them perspicacious again, raising the question of whether the 1% truism should be retired.\n \n \"For many, many years, the 1% difference served us well because it was underappreciated how similar we were,\" says Pascal Gagneux, a zoologist at UC San Diego. \"Now it's totally clear that it's more a hindrance for understanding than a help.\"\n \n Using novel yardsticks and the flood of sequence data now available for several species, researchers have uncovered a wide range of genomic features that may help explain why we walk upright and have bigger brains--and why chimps remain resistant to AIDS and rarely miscarry. Researchers are finding that on top of the 1% distinction, chunks of missing DNA, extra genes, altered connections in gene networks, and the very structure of chromosomes confound any quantification of \"humanness\" versus \"chimpness.\" \"There isn't one single way to express the genetic distance between two complicated living organisms,\" Gagneux adds.\n \n When King and the rest of the researchers in the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium first detailed the genome of our closest relative in 2005, they simultaneously provided the best validation yet of the 1% figure and the most dramatic evidence of its limitations. The consortium researchers aligned 2.4 billion bases from each species and came up with a 1.23% difference. However, as the chimpanzee consortium noted, the figure reflects only base substitutions, not the many stretches of DNA that have been inserted or deleted in the genomes. The chimp consortium calculated that these \"indels,\" which can disrupt genes and cause serious diseases such as cystic fibrosis, alone accounted for about a 3% additional difference (Science, 2 September 2005, p. 1468).\n \n Figure 1 The 6.4% difference. Throughout evolution, the gain (+) in the number of copies of some genes and the loss (-) of others have contributed to humanchimp differences.\n \n SOURCE: J. P. DEMUTH ET AL.\n \n Entire genes are also routinely and randomly duplicated or lost, further distinguishing humans from chimps. A team led by Matthew Hahn, who does computational genomics at Indiana University, Bloomington, has assessed gene gain and loss in the mouse, rat, dog, chimpanzee, and human genomes. In the December 2006 issue of PLoS ONE, Hahn and co-workers reported that human and chimpanzee gene copy numbers differ by a whopping 6.4%, concluding that \"gene duplication and loss may have played a greater role than nucleotide substitution in the evolution of uniquely human phenotypes and certainly a greater role than has been widely appreciated.\"\n \n Yet it remains a daunting task to link genotype to phenotype. Many, if not most, of the 35 million base-pair changes, 5 million indels in each species, and 689 extra genes in humans may have no functional meaning. \"To sort out the differences that matter from the ones that don't is really difficult,\" says David Haussler, a biomolecular engineer at UC Santa Cruz, who has identified novel elements in the human genome that appear to regulate genes (Science, 29 September 2006, p. 1908).\n \n Daniel Geschwind, a neuroscientist at UC Los Angeles (UCLA), has taken at stab at figuring out what matters by applying systems biology to quantifying and analyzing genetic differences between human and chimpanzee brains. Working with his graduate student Michael Oldham and UCLA biostatistician Steve Horvath, Geschwind compared which of 4000 genes were turned on at the same time, or \"coexpressed,\" in specific regions of the dissected brains.\n \n With these data, they built gene networks for each species. \"A gene's position in a network has huge implications,\" Geschwind says. Genes that are coexpressed most frequently with other genes have the most functional relevance, he argues.\n \n Geschwind and his colleagues clustered the networks into seven modules that correspond to various brain regions, such as the cortex. Comparisons of the map of each cluster's network in each species plainly showed that certain connections exist in humans but not chimps. In the cortex, for example, 17.4% of the connections were specific to humans, Geschwind and co-workers reported in the 21 November 2006 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Although the differences don't immediately reveal why, say, humans get Alzheimer's and chimps don't, the maps clearly organize and prioritize differences. \"It really brings the critical hypotheses into strong relief,\" says Geschwind.\n \n Could researchers combine all of what's known and come up with a precise percentage difference between humans and chimpanzees? \"I don't think there's any way to calculate a number,\" says geneticist Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo, a chimp consortium member based at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. \"In the end, it's a political and social and cultural thing about how we see our differences.\"",
