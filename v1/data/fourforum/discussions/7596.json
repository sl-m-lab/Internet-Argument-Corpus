   "Dear Readers\n I would like to share with you the way our school's education system is in Washington D.C.\n Some schools across the nation, but not many, have what we call down here an ARC. It is short for Acedemic Resource Center. Now, let me tell you a bit about it. When a child is struggling with calculus, math, history, english, or science, we have a bundle of people in their willing to help. Now, at most of the high schools, we have an ARC with four tutors that were either former teachers or college professors. We have four teachers. One does science, one does Social studies, one does math, and the other does English. \n Now, many schools have these, but are not for normal people like you and me. Some schools have what I call a special education room. Also called a learning center. Now, they should open more ARC'S around the nation. This would certainly help our children. I know it helped mine. My daughter was having trouble with her AP calculus, and she went in and got help from the math tutor. Within a day, she was undrestanding it.\n Now, I think all schools should have these, because with a little tutoring, these kids can understand and possibly do better in school.\n We all want our kids to suceed in school don't we?\n Well, I have sent some struggling kids in my science and Calculus classes down to the ARC when they were strugling. I am talking, a failing grade, and not understanding a damn thing about the criteria.\n Now, a few days after I sent them down there, they came back understanding it, and in a few weeks, they raised their grade to a passing grade. I recently came out of retirement, and am teaching calculus and science at a high school. But, ever since the ARC came to power a month ago, I have seen so many kids getting better at math and science, and many of my co-workers say the same to me. Now, granted, not everyone will get better at math after the ARC. They have to go down maybe once a week, or more, and spend atleast an hour with whoever and they will see results.\n My daughter was failing calculus, I mean failing, and she spend two days a week down there, and, she became a passing student in no time.\n So, why aren't all schools doing this? I mean, high school is more important than middle school. High school will tell the future of your life. Middle school, my youngest, she mostly lays back. But, my oldest, this is the time to see what colleges she is getting into, and whether or not she is able to handle the real world. But, this would be important in high school. I have taught decades. I have seen so much struggle. This is such a good idea. So, again, why are the other schools in the nation not doing this?\n I did a little research. My father said in Albequrkue or however you spell it, is doing this program. My neice in Rapid City says her schools have them down there.\n Washington D.C. has them, and I have taught at Boston, they have them. We need them in every high school in the nation. Now, some kids don't need one. They can just go and ask ol' dad for some help, but, what if he is not home? SOme kids ask their teachers, but, lets save a hassle. Lets ask the tutors.\n Why isn't every school in Amerika doing this? My philosophy is that if their is help, they will come. \n -Dr. John Milosevic",
