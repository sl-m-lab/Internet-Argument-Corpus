   "Fatal holdup at Bledsoe&#x2019;s Rental investigated - KansasCity.com\n \n \nKansas City police on Friday continued to look for two armed robbers who fatally shot a store employee Thursday afternoon even though the victim didn't appear to offer any resistance.\n \n The deadly holdup at Bledsoe's Rental, which rents tools and equipment, occurred about 2:10 p.m. at 5025 Prospect Ave.\n \n Police said one of the two gunmen forced one employee to the back of the store to get money. The other gunman stayed up front and guarded David W. Bledsoe, 50, as Bledsoe sat in a chair.\n \n Bledsoe and the gunman \"exchanged words,\" police said. Bledsoe said something to the effect of, \"You're not going to shoot me,\" police said, but then the gunman did just that.\n \n The other employee did not witness the shooting, police said. The gunmen fled with an undisclosed amount of cash.\n \n Despite being wounded, Bledsoe chased the gunmen. He hopped in his truck and followed them before pulling over and collapsing. He later died.\n \n Police said they don't think Bledsoe resisted or challenged the gunman.\n \n \"This is a business robbery that went terribly wrong,\" said Police Sgt. Richard Sharp.\n \n Homicide Capt. Floyd Mitchell called Bledsoe a \"truly innocent victim.\"\n\n \n So what was that the gun control advocates were saying? \"Give them want they want, don't resist, trying to be a hero just makes things worse\"? Well congratulations, your advice got the guy killed. Can't get much worse than being dead.",

The batmen fled with an undisclosed amount of cash.\n \n Despite being wounded, Bledsoe chased the batmen. He hopped in his truck and followed them before pulling over and collapsing. He later died.\n \n Police said they don&#8217;t think Bledsoe resisted or challenged the batman.\n \n &#8220;This is a business robbery that went terribly wrong,&#8221; said Police Sgt. Richard Sharp. \"People don't realize how lethal baseball bats really are. Our town's law enforcement officials are serioulsy considering arming police officers and other law enforcement personnel with baseball bats instead of guns. They are cheaper to purchase and mantain and, in the hands of properly trained officers more effective than guns. Also I personally find more satisfaying to bash to death a criminal with a baseball bat than simply shoot him. My prefered baseball bat is a hollow steel one filled with ball bearings\".\n \n Homicide Capt. Floyd Mitchell called Bledsoe a &#8220;truly innocent victim.&#8221; \n \n \"guns don't kill\" baseball bats do :xbanghead",

   "And you seem to think that a person who was provoked into committing murder over the matter of a simple question would somehow not be willing to carry out the same murder if he had to do it with a bat rather than a firearm? That's completely stupid.\n \n Somebody get murdered despite blind compliance and unquestioning submissiveness, and you want to argue about the resolve of the killer and whether or not he would've gone through with it if he hadn't had a firearm at his disposal?\n\n \n No, its not stupid. While the end result is the same, there is a world of difference between beating somebody to death and shooting them and any reasonable person knows it. \n \n There was no blind compliance and unquestioning submission here. He taunted the guy with the gun. If you tell a guy with a baseball bat \"you are not going to hit me\" he gives you a beatdown and walks away. You have just had a painful lesson about writing checks with your mouth that your body cant cash. Do the same with a guy holding a gun and you get a fatal lesson about the same thing. \n \n Nato, a lot of the pro gunners here are just plain XXXXXX. Anything they perceive as being anti gun illicit an ignorant soaked knee jerk reaction from them. You are not one of the XXXXXX. You are perfectly capable of debating the gun issue without trying to pretend that a baseball bat is in the same class as a handgun when it comes to lethality. You dont have to stoop to pretending that a single shot .22 and an AR with a drum mag are the same thing to make your point. If you spout foolishness you get classed in with the fools and it makes us all look bad. \n \n \n \n\n \n I'd rather not face an attacker at all. But obviously that's not going to be an option either here or in the real world. I'd also rather the attacker not be able to arm himself in a manner that puts him at an advantage over myself or anyone else. But to ask for that is completely unrealistic.\n \n If I'm forced to choose I'd rather have the attacker be armed with a baseball bat. Why? Because it can't be swung in the proper manner in a hallway, making it a tactical disadvantage in favor of the attacker. Plus there's the fact that with the right maneuvering the baseball bat can be used to induce a limb lock or a choke hold, or be more easily wrenched away by somebody willing to fight and used to shatter the pelvic bone structure so the attacker can't get back up again.\n \n\n \n Come on....the odds of getting a baseball bat away from a guy who is trying to beat you with it are somewhere between slim and none. I know that there are self defense classes where they \"teach\" you foolishness like that, but try it some time. Your only real hope is to try to get inside his swing and then hope he does not have the presence of mind to choke up on the bat and beat the snot out of you anyway. \n \n The \"right maneuvering\" when approached by a guy with a baseball bat intent on pummeling you with it is a strategic retreat until you can find some kind of weapon of your own to counter with. I know in the movies they are really good at taking baseball bats from bad guys and choking them with them. In the real world it aint that easy. \n \n This is one of those places you can just shoot straight. You would rather be confronted by a guy with a baseball bat because you are FAR more likely to get killed by the guy with the gun. You dont have to give an explanation about how your ninja training actually makes you immune to baseball bat attacks. We all understand that guns are just REALLY effective killing machines. FAR more effective than a chunk of wood. That is why we HAVE guns...mankind wanted more effective ways to kill than running things down and bashing it with a chunk of wood (or a rock). Hitting somebody with a stick is just in an entirely separate class from plugging them with a .357. \n \n So lets deal in facts here:\n \n Fact.....Bledsoe was shot during a robbery.\n Fact.....Mouthing off to a guy pointing a gun at you is a bad idea\n Fact.....If the guy had been armed with a baseball bat, Bledsoe would probably be alive\n Fact.....Laws regarding ownership of guns and their use were obviously no kind of deterrent whatsoever to the criminal\n Fact.....Those same laws were a deterrent to Bledsoe. \n \n There are certainly logical conclusions that can be drawn and debated from this, such as that the criminal in question is most likely to choose the most effective weapon for his nefarious activities (most likely a gun) and that he is going to get one whether they are legal or not, since he is clearly not interested in obeying the law.",

You have just had a painful lesson about writing checks with your mouth that your body cant cash. Do the same with a guy holding a gun and you get a fatal lesson about the same thing.\n\n \n So Bledsoe gave the guy everything he wanted, didn't offer up any resistance to interfere in the robber's plans or make any physical assault against him, and that doesn't qualify as compliance with the demands of the bad guy? What kind of logic is that?\n \n It really sounds like Bledsoe is being blamed for his own death here, like if he just hadn't opened his mouth then he wouldn't have gotten killed...just like if women didn't wear sexy clothes they wouldn't get raped.\n \n Do the rules really need to be changed here? Instead of telling people \"Give the attacker exactly what they want, don't try to be a hero, resisting just makes things worse\" do we now need to change the advice to warn against any possible provocation that might make a mentally unstable individual decide to kill? That kind of advice goes far beyond any measure of being reasonable.\n \n This man shot an unarmed man who was likely on his knees in a gangland execution style. And why? Because Bledsoe opened his mouth to speak. Don't even try and say that this guy was somehow mentally stable and fully willing to let him live if he had just kept his mouth shut. Such nonsense is the stuff of bad Hollywood movies.\n \n \nNato, a lot of the pro gunners here are just plain XXXXXX.

Anybody who would kill an unarmed individual over the matter of a simple question can't be reasoned with or seen as reasonable by any degree.
