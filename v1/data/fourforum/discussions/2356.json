   "So I've heard a lot of people say that \"God loves\" or \"God hates\" or some other phrase which assumes that God has human emotions. How can you compare how human beings feel and interact to the way an omnipotent and omniscient being could \"feel\"? What motivates God? If He has the power to know, see, and do everything, what \"feelings\" or purposes would guide His actions. We can't assume in this case that God has feelings like loneliness or affection because these are human emotions and would make him an imperfect being (as humans are called when compared to deities). So how can you make the assumption that He can love or hate?\n \n Also, when answering, don't quote Scripture. If I wanted to ask the Bible, I would read it. I'm asking for your thoughts and ideas, not quotes from a book.",

Man does not create concepts of his own, but all ideas come from simplified ideas all mixed together. Take a unicorn for example; we've all seen a horse, and a horn, so if you combine the two ideas, you have a unicorn. Furthermore, if God was to create man in his image, I believe that means something besides the physical. How can the eternal, which transcends the physical, in itself be physical? I believe we cannot comprehend Gods true form, so instead, he gives us the mental image of a perfect human form as a guideline (since we are so needy). So if God made us in his image, meaning the sould in this case, then we would have many of the same traits as He would. How can we have something that He did not create? It doesn't make sense? How can there be a specification that the manufacturer did not notice, especially when the design was perfect? So God must have emotions, because if not, then why did men love in the first place if we knew not what it was?",

With me wearing cheap lace-up boots while the other boys had penny loafers, sneakers, Tony Lama&#8217;s or the like, I grew to want more than I needed. It changed me. I was no longer who I once was it seemed. It was really akin to depravity. Of course I didn&#8217;t understand that until I was a little older. It made me feel inferior not to have what others had. I felt like I was being mistreated in some way. It finally got to the point that it gave me a complex. I was unable to communicate with others without the urge to hang my head. I hid this for awhile, but the man-in-the-mirror had it written all over his face. Suppression came along, I dealt with it, and it became a part of my life. Soon it was my life.\n Then one day I decided to really find out if God was real and without telling Him, He pulled it out (like a paper hidden in my pocket &#8211; so to speak) and told me it was not necessary to keep anymore.\n So I defined it, I guess, but God made it clear.",

We have them for a reason. It is not so that we obey their thrust. They are a clue as to what is going on in us. \n \n The subduing of emotions (all of them by the way, not just ones typically identified as bad) is simply bringing them under submission to the will. It is how some people can behave heroically. They do what they know is the right thing to do even though they don't really feel like it.\n \n Not heroic, but even for myself, I grew up with an alcoholic father. I learned as a child that if I did not take care of myself then no one else would. Consequently, I treated people as if they are suspect. Unfortunately, I have brought those feelings into my marriage. It is a poor way for a wife to live in relation to her husband when he treats her as always suspect. I have to unlearn what my emotions tell me. I have to learn the new way of thinking. I have to choose to treat my wife like she is on my side, even though it doesn't feel that way.\n \n Emotions tell us where things come from. In the above example, my fear that my wife is against me (when she is obviously not) is unfounded, so where does it come from. I recognize the emotion, feel it, realize its origin and then take it to God for Him to help me to deal with it. He (through prayer, meditation, study etc, helps me to learn to think differently. \n \n You can feel free to come out publicly against christianity (naturally), but you should educate yourself about it and don't assume what a few teach that all teach.

These are natural human emotions that need to be understood, to indiscriminately label them all as just sins, no matter the cause or outcome seems very repressive.\n\n \n The emotions are never labled as sin. The actions are the sins. The emotions MAY be indicative of a sinful heart. This is why we don't deny them. Sex outside of marriage is not an emotion it is an action. A choice. Murder, Idolatry, covetousness is even not an emotion but an action. envy would be an example of the emotion. To envy your neighbor's new jaguar XJ is an emotion, to compete with your neighbor by making the car the most important thing in your life and denying your family so you can drive a similar car, that is covetousness. Adultry is an action, and so on.\n \n Lust is an indication of desire for something forbidden. While it is an emotion and jesus says he who looks on another woman with lust in his heart has committed the sin of adultery, the point Jesus is making is that the condition of the heart is what is important. It is an indicator that I have put sexual relations with a woman who is not my wife above God. I have now begun to treat this woman as an object. That is the true sin, not the emotion, but rather the way I think about this woman. The emotion is what notifies us of problems in our thinking and actions, it is why they are there. To make them paramount over our thinking is sinful, to ignore them altogether is just as sinful.\n \n Does that explain my position better?\n \n \n edited note:\n \n Also, people are not to judge others because only God can know that condition of the heart. We should be wary of others that regularly display sinful behavior as they may not be trustworthy. That does not imply condemnation on our part,just caution. As for God deciding on who gets to be condemned, who would you rather have decide that, you? Me? Bush? Clinton? I think a God that sent His Son to take the punishment for the Sin of the world is the one who deserves to be judge. What he states is that you have a choice to be judged by your behavioror by identification with His Son. You decide the choice is yours. If you go to Hell that is your choice not His. He wanted so much for you to be with Him that He sent His Son. Had he removed the choice altogether then that would not be love, but rather compliance on our part.

Your last paragraph is correct except that lust is an emotion coupled with an action. The actions are sinful. \n \n As well, there are two types of sin. There is the noun and the verb. I have sin. NOun. I sin, verb. \n \n Here is the last thing. The majority of protestant churches teach salvation by Grace through faith regardless of the sins committed. \n \n Montalban could speak more clearly on the orthodox positon and maximus on the catholic. I think the three of us have some dogmatic disagreement but all think all three would say the nicene creed is true.

This is not just avoidance of punishment,but actually being declared righteous, and being adopted into the family of GOd. It is choice offered to all. God will not force it because he desires love, not compliance. \n \n MOntalban: God does experience emotions. Jesus showed anger when he drove out the money changers at the temple (and I know the orthodox consider Jesus to be God). He also said to Jerusalem \"how I long to gather you under my wings.) He cried in the garden before his crucifixion. He felt the shame of the cross. In the psalms God describes himself as a jealous God. (not jealous of but rather jealous for). God states frequently what he desires. These are all emotions. God certainly experiences them. You would have a difficult time scripturally proving otherwise. God does not sin. \n \n This all only goes to prove my point that emotions in and of themselves are part of how we are made and are not sinful. Denying our emotions only leads us into slavery to them. Recognizing, admitting, and discovering what they mean are vital to our growth, physically, emotionally, spiritually. \n \n I hope this answers well. I apologize for the tardiness of the response.

In fact Jesus did say that one sin will not be forgiven, that of an insult against the Holy Spirit.\n Matthew 12\n 31\n And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.\n \n However, James Hogg lampooned this Protestant notion in his book (which from memory)* is called \"Confessions of a Justified Sinner\" in which he says that once he's received his justification -through declaration of faith, as Protestants do, then he is free from worry, and can commit any sin he wants.\n \n It also is problematic to Protestants who believe that they are 'saved', when one realises that some, just one or two, might actually convert to another faith - does this mean that they become 'un-saved'?\n \n Further, Heb.10 says...\n 26\n If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,\n 27\n but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.\n \n So to those that are 'saved', if you now sin, your condemned to hell!\n \n But leaving that aside, sin is that which separates us from God.

   "\n Lust is a negative reaction. It is a form of hate. If I hate my neighbour, I desire what he has, that is, I want to deprive him of what is his.\n \n\n \n Ok, you're saying that if anyone every wants anything or is envious (see also \"covets\") of a neighbour's possession, that means that I hate that person because of it. Isn't that how most people end up wanting something, because they see someone who has it and they imagine themselves with it. This does not mean that they hate that person because they desire the object in their possession because by that logic you are assuming that the only way to procure said object is to steal from or kill that person which is most likely not the case. Competing for resources is a natural instinct, so wanting something that my neighbour wants is purely an instictual urge to compete with my neighbour. And competition is not inherently evil, is it?\n \n Also, is it wrong to harbor a feeling and not act on it? Most dictionaries will say that lust is a purely mental concept that requires no action. Is it wrong to feel sexually attracted to someone because of their looks? This is also instinctual. Why would a religion support the supression of instinctive emotions conveniently labeled lust and envy? Or does this go back to the orignial flaw that caused the Original Sin? If so, it was God's wish to give us the capacity to lust and envy, so who are we to say otherwise. Anyway you put it, I can't see how a religion can justify condemning thoughts of lust and envy without action (unless they're the Thought Police), as the definitions of these words do not imply physical action at all but merely a mental action.",

   "I know this has nothing to do with either your post or the thread, but something occurred to me when reading it.\n \n If Jesus is the only way to salvation what of those people who lived before the 1st coming (if that is the correct term!). If Jesus is the only way then they cannot have been saved, however if salvation didn't require Jesus before hand then isn't it a bit unfair to have the goal posts moved like that?\n\n \n I am enjoying this discussion. As to this, MOntalban is on the right track. Hebrews chapter 11 also answers this question. However, from a philosophical view consider:\n \n 1 God created time.\n 2. God acts both inside and outside time (as the creator of it this is natural).\n 3. Jesus salvation extends in both directions of time.\n 4. Believers were justified by faith in God prior to the first coming. (hebrews chapter 11)\n 5. In genesis the story of Abram/Abraham says \"abram believed God and it was accounted to him as righteousness\"\n 6. The trusting Jesus is that we believe God that Jesus is the way (Jesus is also God by the way).\n \n \n Now on to the topic:\n \n You see, the majority of christians do seem to act the way you say. It is a sad commentary for the church. Believers lives really ought to look different. If we truly believe what GOd has said, we should act that way. Just as an atheist believes there is no God then they act that way. Lying becomes just a necessary tool in the hands of an atheist. \n \n My church is different. Or at least, I think so. I have seen many people come in hurting. I have seen them reveal their addictions to those they trusted in the church and watched the members say, \"you are okay\" They have said this even if they did not stop their addiction (sin). GOd has declared me righteous. If I have an addiction (mine is codependency) then the church should be a place where the sick, sore, wounded and hated can come and find healing, rest, and love. This is what my church believes.\n \n We are not perfect. In fact we fail often. But then we are human beings. God gives us the mercy and grace to fail. In Romans chapter 7 paul describes it as thus: \"I do the very thing I don't want to do and the thing I want to do, I don't do.\" He then asks the question \"who will save me from the body of this sin?\" He also answers, \"thanks be to Jesus Christ.\" He then goes on to say, \"There is therefore, now, no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus...\"(Romans 8:1).\n \n Perhaps the difference is my church believes that we all sin. We are not better than you because we are christian. Even a blind squirrel gets an acorn. I am one blessed squirrel. I am not better than you. I am living under the grace of GOd. You can too. Just because you may choose not to, does not make me better than you. Those that condemn, do so out of their flawed selves. That does not make you better than them. We are all flawed. The question is how are you and I going to deal with that. We can try to live up to the law of God and be perfect all on our own. However, given that we are flawed, that is impossible. It is only by trusting in the grace of God that it is at all possible.\n \n That is my take at least.\n \n MOntalban: I would like to comment on one thing you said. I do think that sin is our natural state. I think you meant to say it was not our original state.",

   "To sglaine:\n Could you please become more literate in your posting and start to check your grammar? I'm not to worried about spelling, but when you don't include full stops that does make it hard to understand where you end one point and start talking about a new one.\n \n But it is still wrong because if you see god or talk to god your NUTS[.] God is dead and has been for quit[e] a while now.  \n \n You are very incorrect. Jesus Christ (and especially God the Father!), is not dead. He is alive, as explained through John 20. He has been successful in conquering sin and death. Did you know that the Christian belief is the only one - to my knowledge - that talks about a risen Saviour, i.e. is alive today? What an amazing LORD we have. One who would freely give His life to save man kind from an eternity of pain and suffering with the devil in hell. Just to think that Jesus would have done that for me (and for you) is just amazing and it illustrates His (and God the Father's) LOVE for us. In fact, John 3:16 tells us that \"God so loved the world that He sent His one and only Son so that everyone who believes in Him will not die but have eternal life.\" What a great promise! So hence, since Jesus Christ is alive, and the Holy Spirit is everywhere, is it not alright to talk to God? I do so on regular occassions.\n \n This verse alone disproves all of those who say that God has no feelings or emotions. And I can tell you, there are many other such verses that describes God's feelings. It is from Him where we get our feelings and emotions from (including our morals, ethics and values, etc.).\n \n As for the devil you mentioned, he will get his punishment as Revelation 20 says.",

Sex can be a result of love, or of hate. If you love, your coming together for sex is not for yourself, but for the other. If you lust, then you are acting upon your own desires, and possibly your partner is doing the same thing, so you believe that just because you're both using each other to get off, that it's love. That's more like a social contract - let's have sex with each other, so that you'll pleasure me, and I'll pleasure you.\n \n In your case perhaps, it is the act of two individuals coming together to use one another, and feeling good, because you both at least got something out of it.\n \n Love would be let me give myself to you, let me make you happy, let me cease to be.",

Sex can be a result of love, or of hate. If you love, your coming together for sex is not for yourself, but for the other. If you lust, then you are acting upon your own desires, and possibly your partner is doing the same thing, so you believe that just because you're both using each other to get off, that it's love. That's more like a social contract - let's have sex with each other, so that you'll pleasure me, and I'll pleasure you.\n \n In your case perhaps, it is the act of two individuals coming together to use one another, and feeling good, because you both at least got something out of it.\n \n Love would be let me give myself to you, let me make you happy, let me cease to be.\nI see what you are saying, but I believe both are possible at once. You can have sex not just for yourself, not just for the other but for both of you, you love the person and want to give yourself for them but also feel lust for them and want be with them yourself.",

   "I am enjoying this discussion. As to this, Montalban is on the right track. Hebrews chapter 11 also answers this question. However, from a philosophical view consider:\n \n 1 God created time.\n 2. God acts both inside and outside time (as the creator of it this is natural).\n 3. Jesus salvation extends in both directions of time.\n 4. Believers were justified by faith in God prior to the first coming. (hebrews chapter 11)\n 5. In genesis the story of Abram/Abraham says \"abram believed God and it was accounted to him as righteousness\"\n 6. The trusting Jesus is that we believe God that Jesus is the way (Jesus is also God by the way).\n\n \n Here, we don't agree at all. I find it odd the choice of words 'on the right track'. That is what Orthodoxy is, 'the Way', containing the full and unaltered teachings of Christ.\n \n Man is not 'justified', there is no contract with God, in which Jesus was the price paid for the contract. We are called to God because we are by nature inclined to do so - to return to Him. Sin however is in the world, and we too are a part of this world, and influenced by this. Satan is always actively trying to deceive us and many find this temptation too great.\n \n Justificiation is a new doctrine, and not how St. Paul understood things at all.\n See \n http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.10.en.original_sin_according_to_st._paul.01.htm\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNow on to the topic:\n \n You see, the majority of christians do seem to act the way you say. It is a sad commentary for the church. Believers lives really ought to look different. If we truly believe what GOd has said, we should act that way. Just as an atheist believes there is no God then they act that way. Lying becomes just a necessary tool in the hands of an atheist. \n \n My church is different. Or at least, I think so. I have seen many people come in hurting. I have seen them reveal their addictions to those they trusted in the church and watched the members say, \"you are okay\" They have said this even if they did not stop their addiction (sin). GOd has declared me righteous. If I have an addiction (mine is codependency) then the church should be a place where the sick, sore, wounded and hated can come and find healing, rest, and love. This is what my church believes.\n \n That is my take at least.\n\n \n Again I have qualms. We don't go to church to feel good. I'm not sure if this is what you are meaning, but that's how it sounds to me.\n \n \nMOntalban: I would like to comment on one thing you said. I do think that sin is our natural state. I think you meant to say it was not our original state.\n\n \n You are correct here, I am wrong to have said so. Ta, for pointing it out.\n \n Sin is not 'natural' as Adam didn't have sin when he was created. But it did enter into the world through his fault.",

He bases his argument on a false interpretation of II Corinthians 5:4 by interpreting eph'ho, here again, as dioti.

   "Thanks, interesting and certainly nothing I'd disagree with (!).\n \n \n I agree, and it is certainly why many become disillusioned with it, as they see it rampant with hypocrisy. \n \n \n I'm not really sure what mean by that. \n \n \n Which church do you belong to?\n \n \n That is a very enlightened point of view, but unfortunately one that very few people (whatever their religion) seem to share.\n\n \n Sorry for the tardiness of my reply. Truthfully, I too behave in ways that are not appropriate for a lover of God. It is true of humans. In reality we are a work in progress. \n \n As for lying and the atheist, the point is that if there is no standard for behavior which lies outside of the human realm, (ie God) then there really is no standard at all. Because, who would get to decide what the standard is? Therefore, lying or stealing or any of a variety of activities are simply convenient and useful at times. In the hands of someone who does not accept a standard then these things are okay provided you don't get caught. However, integrity is doing what is right (from a standard) even when no one is looking. This is what I meant, essentially. Let me know if that is more clear or muddier.\n \n People do indeed become disillusioned with christianity because of christians. HOwever, I would suggest that individuals who really want to know the nature of GOd not look so much at people but at God. Now, you may ask how do yo do that. There is a step of faith involved. I started with the bible. In particular,I started with the letters of Paul and the gospel of Luke. The step of faith is being willing to say, \"I don't know if this is true or not,but for now, I will believe it and try it on for size.\" In other words try it out in your own life. \n \n Go to a church even. You don't have too, (naturally) but if you do, remember they are flawed people looking for answers like any other. Christians are not perfect. Look for the church that knows that people are not perfect and the church that is willing to be flawed in front of you and to work on it in front of you. They do exist. They typically don't advertise themselves extensively, but wait for the walking wounded to wander in. Once there, as you come to know them, let them see you in your flaws, and seek their help to deal with them.\n \n I put this like this is something YOU should do. It is not what meant. Although you can if you wish, all I was trying to do was actually communicate what I found in my church. They are flawed people. The leaders are too. They have made terrible mistakes and hurt many. But, I believe the grace of God is big enough to deal with all of this. It is big enough to deal with even my flaws. I occasionally have insulted or attacked people on this board. It is not my desire,but I have done it. I seek not to and continue to learn and grow. \n \n My church is an independent nondenominational church. We are lovers and followers of Christ. We hold scripture to be the revelation of Jesus. We do not hold church tradition as the equivalent of scripture as the roman catholic and the orthodox churches do. We are protestant. we are christian. \n \n I hope I have answered well. Let me know if you have questions or see fault in my logic. \n \n thanks",

Luther liberally changed scripture and thus interpretation at a number of different places, so now scripture says something else. He added teachings that were new. He taught things that no one had taught for the first 1,500 years of the Christian world, but he DID base it on Scripture - well done!\n \n So, you can say \"Scripture says this...\", but of course it does. Such a hollow truism might keep you asleep at night, but I'd be wanting to know\n \n \"Has it always been this way?\"\n \n And clearly it has not. My church is the church that compiled the Bible, and it interpreted that same Bible one way... as it still does.\n \n Thus, you won't accept tradition, you'll accept Scripture, that has been changed in word and/or in interpretation. It is akin to me forging a note, and, for you, as long as it says $4.00, that's okay... you don't care how it got that way.
