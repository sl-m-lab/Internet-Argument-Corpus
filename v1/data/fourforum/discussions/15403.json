   "Let me just give it to you straight-out, libertarianism is the quintessential political expression of the same suburbanite urge to separate from our society's socioeconomic troubles, born from its socioeconomic disparities, that tends to produce \"white flight\". To really gnomically nutshell it right up front, the same middle-class, Me-Generation griping about affirmative action, multiculturalism, and the myth of \"reverse racism\" that can be heard around white-collar water coolers tightly focused into a phony, middle-brow free-marketarian philosophy = the modern rightist fringe political phenomenon of \"libertarianism\", and it's popularity predominantly among negrophobic and Hispanophobic folks of the Caucasian persuasion.\n \n That is, \"libertarianism\" is the white-flight mentalit\u00e9 equipped with a political belief system. It's an irritatedly individualistic ideology for whiny white people who are disaffected from and would like to opt out of a welfare state that serves what they consider to be the parasitical dregs of society, i.e. mostly people of color living below the poverty line who because of limited opportunities find themselves entangled in our society's social safety net.\n \n In other words, libertarians see the world from an everyone-should-just-look-out-for-#1 perspective with subtle racial overtones. Naturally they loathe the very idea of socialism, of being thrown together on equal terms with the needy non-white neighbors they wish to disown and distance themselves from. Socialism is about solidarity and what libertarians really want is isolationism from the economically challenged and \"ethnic\" underclass.\n \n Libertarians aren't technically \"racist\" per se, they don't actually have hatred in their hearts for minorities, their hearts are too cold for that. They just lack any and all sense of connectedness with the underprivileged and the discriminated-against.\n \n Libertarians certainly don't fancy being taxed one red cent to make a helping difference in the life of the stereotypical black welfare mom. Their mentality's motto is \"Millions for prisons but not a penny for tribute to the poor masses of the economically distressed inner cities of the nation\". And since African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately represented among the recipients of public assistance, the libertarian's resentment against \"free riders\" becomes somewhat of a racial bias.\n \n The libertarian's callous attitude toward those whom he perceives as society's leeches and losers rubs off on his attitude toward the victims of social and racial injustice, this is essentially how a racial tude is born from his worldview. It's the libertarian's selfish desire to not be bothered and burdened with the needs of capitalism's victims that leads to a lack of empathy and sympathy and a tendency to insensitively profile the poor that's tinged with classism and bigotry.\n \n It turns out that libertarianism is largely just an intellectual construct that accommodates and rationalizes all of the above and allows the \"libertarian\" to put a principled spin on his version of political self-interest and identity politics. So, again, no, the libertarian doesn't quite have hate burning in his stony, selfish heart, he just doesn't have much love in it for anyone but himself and those with whom he identifies, which doesn't include poor black and brown folks.\n \n Of course though, in some cases the libertarian's lack of affinity for the cash-poor and melanin-rich can become a palpable political animosity that really comes through in the stridency of his \"politically-incorrect\" stance, and that smacks of actual racism. But libertarians don't ever really let their racialist freak flag fly, they just become downright bold about ideologically dissing the disadvantaged dark-skinned demographic of society.\n \n Well then, the libertarian's fondness for laissez&#8211;faire capitalism and his willingness to abolish social programs that feed poor children in the ghetto blurs together and it becomes a Which came first, the chicken or the egg question. Either way, libertarians definitely have their racial issues and need to fess up about this shameful truth of their psychology. Sure, behind a person's politics you always find psychology, none of us is truly all that objective, but sometimes it's an enlightened mind-set that shines through into one's politics, and other times it's a benighted mentality lurking in dark recesses of one's mind. Alas, in the case of libertarians it's sadly the latter.\n \n Want some anecdotal evidence, have you ever noticed how many libertarians can get pretty cranky and conceited about the superiority of their logic when dealing with someone who disagrees with them? This is just another symptom that their philosophical point of view is that of an egoist with anti-egalitarian attitudes, someone who isn't interested in playing well with others on a level societal playing field. That is, libertarians are so deeply invested in and touchy about their politics that it becomes obvious that their politics are actually an extension of a certain chauvinistic type of personality and take on life.\n \n A veritable misanthropic take on life that seems to single out and concentrate on categories of people that are an easy mark for it, such as women, immigrants, and certain races. The more intensely the libertarian spotlights such groups with his hostility, the thinner a veneer his ideology becomes for a subconscious racism.\n \n But what would the libertarian's utopia look like, would it be such an inhospitable place for low-status groups to live in, would they be in a better position to raise their status in a libertarian promised land? Well, arguably the sort of free-for-all \"meritocracy\" that the libertarian advocates would soon degenerate into a plutocracy, those with a more ruthless drive to be on top would have a free hand with which to cut throats and would soon establish their social and political dominance over the rest of us. We'd find ourselves living under a feudalistic form of capitalism in which most of us are reduced to the role of white-collar vassals and blue-collar serfs. And since there'd be few if any legal protections against discrimination in such a system people who've historically been the victims of racism would continue to find things stacked against them and would end up being a sizable percentage of the serf class. Not exactly an inviting prospect for non-Caucasoids!\n \n Libertarians like to retreat from this ugly reality into nice legal fictions of \"social contracts\", but would their kind of social contract, a social contract based on naked self-interest, even have an \"equal protection clause\" of any sort? And assuming it did, if libertarians abolished big brotherly courts in their free-marketeer's Shangri-la then who would enforce it? The free market itself? That's just ivory-tower theory that doesn't ever pan out empirically.\n \n No, under libertarianism unchecked processes of social sedimentation would deposit most well-pigmented people in an underclass where they'd be at the mercy of Mighty Whitey and his capitalist ruling class more than ever. This prospect doesn't bother the libertarian too much though, both because he suffers from an empathy deficit and also because his social contract would provide him with an escape clause to be a selfish individualist with no social responsibility to the colored causalities of capitalism.\n \n To sum up here, it's hardly surprising that many right-libertarians adored the angry white man's candidate Ron Paul (who in fact wrote racist newsletters in the 90s). At best the libertarian is insensitively indifferent to racial justice issues, at worst he sides with the opposition to racial justice on the grounds that freedom is an absolute that ought not be compromised to protect our civil rights. Ironically his love of freedom endangers those very rights that make freedom worth having! Yes, in a supremely ironic twist the libertarian turns out to be an anti-civil libertarian reactionary with a cold-bloodedly individualistic creed.\n \n emoticon_smile",

Yes, in a supremely ironic twist the libertarian turns out to be an anti-civil libertarian reactionary with a cold-bloodedly individualistic creed.\n \n emoticon_smile\n\n \n Your attempt to link libertarianism with racism doesn't really make sense. Libertarians generally believe that less government is better. They're social liberals and fiscal conservatives. I don't see anything racist about that, and the fact that you're pulling the race card on them is despicable.\n \n The government has been growing and intruding into our everyday lives since the beginning of our country. It's rampant spending and mismanagement has gotten us into our current economic debacle. Silly laws continue to remain on the books that intrude into our personal lives and eat away at our personal freedoms. Children can now become \"sex offenders\" for posting lewd pictures of themselves (If they were too young to make an intelligent decision, how can they then be held legally responsible for it? It's a bizarre paradox where they are too innocent to choose sex, but mature enough to choose be sex offenders). 18 year old high school seniors can be sent to jail for having sex with their high school sweetheart. Anyone can be arrested for enjoying pot within the privacy of their own home. We're getting our privates groped and our bodies radiated every time we need to travel somewhere on an airplane. The government can legally wiretap you, arrest you, and suspend your right to habeas corpus. Most of our money is going to either foreign aid or the military, and for that reason our government must tax the hell out of us while providing our children with crappy education and social services. The first, second, and fourth amendments are becoming bigger jokes each year. Our founding fathers would be turning in their graves right now. \n \n And you're trying to tell me that all of this is somehow racist? That the desire for freedom and liberty makes libertarians somehow cranky, old, and white? Ron Paul has got to be one of the last decent, consistent, and honest politicians left. Do I agree with everything he says? Hell no. I'm a Democrat. But I have more respect for the libertarians than I do anyone else, even fellow Democrats. They're the only ones with any outrage at the direction America is traveling in, and they're the only ones willing to do anything substantial about it.",

Libertarians don't have a callous attitude toward \"victims of social and racial injustice\", they just don't think it's the government's job to fix all of your problems at everyone else's expense.

   "Believe me, I have. Your whole argument is based on a flawed view of libertarians...\n\n \n Thank you for your feedback. Here are some thoughts.\n \n I certainly don't claim to be a psychic, but I do know from replies such as yours what most libertarians reading this post are in all likelihood thinking, you're thinking \"Hey, I'm no racist because I'm not a hater, and as a libertarian I'm certainly not a hater\". This is of course a rather common and simplistic misconception, i.e. that being a racist = being a hatemonger. Nope, there's another sense in which one can be a racist, a sense that's more true to the word. One can be a racist in the sense of being a part of the problem, rather than a part of the solution of society's structural racism.\n \n And, what's more, one can be a part of society's systemic racism by passive participation, by being an apathetic accessory. This is certainly the case with quite a few conservatives-libertarians, after all. Well, folks on the right of the ole political divide haven't exactly been known for their passionate support of the civil rights movement, or for the concept of social justice for the disadvantaged!\n \n No, of course Caucasians in general, and conservatives in particular, aren't prone to be malignant and vicious fans of racial enmity and strife. The majority of whites who are a party to the problem and share in the social sin of racism are such not because they have a little Klansman lurking in their unconsciousness, but rather simply because they are utterly unsympathetic to the real socioeconomic plight of the victims of racism.\n \n Why are so many white individuals so insensitively indifferent about racial injustice? Well, of course many human beings simply have an unsympathetic psychological nature. Others, however, due to their unsympathetic psychological nature, gravitate toward conservatism and libertarianism, toward ideologies that make them more hardcore about being unsympathetic. This is because conservatism-libertarianism provides cognitive justifications, excuses for unsympathetic types to withdraw, to withdraw their sympathy and compassion from aggrieved people of color, to withdraw from being a constructive partaker in the societal process of resolving the societal issue of race in a progressive fashion.\n \n Instead, conservatives and libertarians have a whole, prefabricated intellectual construct that legitimizes their preference to remain in dishonest denial and pathetically cry: \"Wah, wah, wah, reverse racism! Boo-hoo and woe is me, I'm such a victim of affirmative action!\", and so on. Yes, in an ironic twist conservative white individuals arrogate and usurp the role of victim for themselves, while at the same time criticizing minorities for having a self-defeating victim mentality! Now this is what I call a case of being hypocritical with chutzpah.\n \n Oh well, the upshot is that conservatism-libertarianism is a worldview that reflects, rationalizes, ratifies, and reinforces an unsympathetic attitude into a full-blown doctrinaire system of belief. A system of belief that is not about race or promoting racial hatred per se, but that does promote a defensive and resentful disbelief in the racial injustice endured by non-Caucasoid members of society. A system of belief that causes its adherents to turn a deaf ear to the cries of social pain and righteous indignation of minorities. A system of belief that often makes its indoctrinees callous and insulting in their opinions on race. A system of belief that promotes government policies that take us in the regressive direction of perpetuating and worsening, as opposed to addressing and ameliorating, race problems.\n \n Conservatism-libertarianism, that is, is an ideology of deplorable racial ignorance, not commendable color blindness. Conservatism, and its peevish proponents of the delusionally unsympathetic fiction that racism is a thing of the past, in fact are in a very big way, in a ginormous way, a part of the problem. In this sense conservatism-libertarianism is very much tarnished by racism.\n \n Libertarianism of course takes the tack of disengagement with society in general, embracing an extreme every-man-for-himself-in-the-free-for-all-of-the-free-market individualism in which we're all asocially self-owning units with no ethical responsibility to the greater good of society. This intellectual attitude and dodge of capitalistically self-interested disengagement quite transparently allows libertarians to unsympathetically disengage from the misfortunes of minorities, to advocate abolishing such meager social mercies as food stamps and Medicaid, and to advocate utter neglect of the social problems stemming from racism, on the pretext of the theory that the forces of the \"free market\" will swoop in and right all wrongs. Mm-hmm, libertarianism is all about rationalizingly divorcing oneself from any obligation to social justice, and therefore is antithetical to racial justice, is de facto a part of the problem and ethically discredited by its own apathetic form of racism.\n \n Yes, conservatism in general has its own racial issues that make it a force standing against progress on race, and that give it an all too strong family resemblance with the haters on its lunatic fringe. Just last night I saw a segment on The Ed Show about how conservatives in Congress have pressured the Department of Homeland Security to lay off of hate-spewing ultra-right-wing groups that are potential terror threats, and of course the obvious explanation is that conservatives recognize their family resemblance with these extremist groups. Yep, conservatives recognize them as kooky cousins whom they'd like to keep in the attic, and by giving them any attention the Department of Homeland Security threatens to out the ugliness at the heart of conservatism. Instead of finding the integrity and moral courage to face this ugliness, conservative have placed us all in jeopardy by nixing law enforcement's ability to keep tabs on virulent and vicious rightist haters.\n \n Well, what this all points up is that conservatives are dealing with the question of race very much in bad faith, and need to grow some moral you-know-what.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n :)",

Libertarians take the same position as liberals on social issues, and judging by your whining about modern day \"structural racism\", you're a liberal.\n \n Have you ever stopped and asked yourself how a party that tirelessly campaigns for the widest possible degree of individual freedom and liberty could in any way be construed as racist?",

   "Am I the only one that feels this thread has gone around in circles? charleslb starts out saying libertarians are racist because they basically do not believe in government intervention with numerous issues such as taxing to \"help\" minorities. Shooter correctly points out that it isn't a racist component but rather a realization that government has a role in some things and not others. Charleslb comes back and says libertarians are racist because they don't support government intervention. \n \n This entire time we see the underlying premise that charleslb has that libertarians flat out say is not true; Government help all social problems. \n \n We could take charleslb's theory to the extreme and say if government doesn't spend every last dime on minorities than they are racist. I think everyone would agree this is ridiculous. At the same time we could say there should be 0 government role in any social issues whatsoever. Likewise I think a majority of people, even libertarians, would say this is ridiculous. At this point you are merely arguing about how much of a role the government should play. Libertarians think less. This is not to imply they think helping those disadvantaged is not important but that any more government assistance would not be a help or the trade off is not worth it. \n \n So I'm not seeing the racial dimension of libertarianism. Racism has always meant one group of people feeling they are better than a particular race. Look up the word, that's the definition. None of the libertarian ideas really do that and if anything promote equality.",

   "... You should be railroading conservatives, not libertarians... \n\n \n Okeydoke, let's see. Here are some thoughts apropos of your suggestion. \n \n Capitalism&#8217;s quintessential queen of mean, Leona Helmsley, once infamously said that paying taxes is for the &#8220;little people&#8221;. This disgusting bit of brazen truth-telling by the maladroit mother of all miserly capitalist moguls however does provide us with a good nutshell definition of capitalism. Capitalism is an inherently inequitable system in which the little people incur and endure all the human pain of maintaining the inhuman machine that is the economy. You know, the pain of taxes, of doing all the inglorious and tough jobs that need to be done in society, of being underpaid and chronically struggling to make ends meet, of recessions and inflation, and the existential pain of being mere cogs in the machine and of living in a state of constant anxiety about all of the above conditions and one&#8217;s unpromising prospect of a better standard of living. And meanwhile of course the fat owners get to sit pretty with all the perks, from tax subsidies (aka corporate welfare) to the posh, high-end style of living their ill-gotten green finances. \n \n Such is capitalism down here in the real world, as opposed to up in the ivory tower of free-marketeers. Capitalism should be called capitalocracy, or moneyocracy, for capitalism is, quite naturally, a system in which those who control the capital, the money, for all practical purposes govern society and get to have their way with it, and with our lives. Which brings us to how capitalism figures into racism. Quite simply, in a system in which capitalists, i.e. owners, own and run the politico-economic show, well, in such a system owners get to enforce their own sense of ethnic identity and ethnic self-interest, their own identity politics, their own racial in-group vs. out-group thinking, their own racial favoritism and prejudices. And when you translate prejudice from something merely harbored in a powerless individual&#8217;s mind into prejudices enforced by the power structure of society, prejudices that are enforced in the way educational, employment, and all other economic resources are allocated and applied, then, ta-da and voil\u00e0!, you have racism. \n \n Capitalism, then, is a system that overly lends itself to such an enforcement of the economic and ethnocentric privatism of the ruling class. That is, the racially-skewed realeconomik dominance of the largely white capitalist ruling class subtly &#8220;trickles down&#8221; to the rest of the white population, in the form of not being discriminated against on the basis of skin color, in the form of having lower poverty rates and an unemployment rate that&#8217;s half that of black and Hispanic citizens, in the form of not being redlined out of up-scale neighborhoods, in the form of not being overrepresented in the prison system, in the form of better funded schools, and in the form of an all-around higher and more advantaged status. In other words, capitalism is a system that structurally permits and promotes general inequality and racial disparities. Capitalism is the matrix of racism.\n \n Now then, as for conservatism, conservatism is the political ideology and camp that doctrinairely defends capitalism as an abstract concept, and that most stridently takes up the cause of capitalists and corporations on the op-ed pages of newspapers, on talk radio, and in government&#8217;s halls of power and back rooms. Whether in the media or in Congress, conservatives shill for the big-business elite, and therefore share in the moral responsibility for societal sins such as poverty, hunger, unemployment, homelessness, classism, and of course the racism that spins off of classism. Sure, it&#8217;s not only conservative politicians who promiscuously get in bed with the moneyed powers that be, but it&#8217;s conservatives who do so with ideological gusto and self-righteousness, and who rationalizingly advocate revamping the entire system so as to give the rich even more license to victimize workingpeople, and people of color. \n \n Conservatives, that is, believe as a matter of perverse principle that the already excessively empowered capitalist elite should be given the kind of deregulated wide berth that would allow them to set themselves up as an out-and-out dictatorship of the plutotariat, so to speak. This being their firm creed and mind-set, conservatives are constantly supporting the socioeconomic asymmetries of our capitalist society, and policies that will grow these asymmetries into even more glaring and gross inequities.\n \n What&#8217;s more, identifying with and reserving all sympathy for society&#8217;s alpha capitalists, and lacking sufficient empathy for capitalism&#8217;s casualties, conservatives historically have opposed all legislation designed to improve the lot of society&#8217;s working class and racial minorities. For instance, conservatives oppose the very concept of a minimum wage to guarantee a more decent standard of living to the working poor &#8211; you know, those folks, white and disproportionately minority, who receive only the crumbs of the economic pie. Conservatives also stalwartly oppose compassionate social programs to aid the residents of our largely unemployed inner cities. It was also card-carrying conservatives who stood at the forefront of opposing the Civil Rights Movement, and the progressive legislation that came out of it. And conservatives are of course deeply antagonistic to the whole idea of &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; to combat racism in the job market.\n \n Mm-hmm, conservatives just drown out the cries for justice of blacks and Hispanics subjected to unfair discrimination by employers by droning on about the &#8220;free market&#8221; and how it will spontaneously right all the wrongs of society if only left alone. Free-market theory is the conservative&#8217;s great philosophical dogma and ruse for rationalizing his/her uncaring attitudes and public policies. However, despite hypocritically hiding out behind the righteous persona of a true believer in economic freedom, we find that the typical conservative is someone with a mentality that&#8217;s unconscionably untroubled by the loss of freedom and dignity that overempowering the capitalist elite leads to for millions of poor people of all hues, and non-Caucasians in particular. \n \n Alas then, conservatives are ideologically and integrally complicit in social and racial iniquity, and in the way it tends to take root in a system such as capitalism, in which wealth and power are so unevenly distributed. Conservatives are people who&#8217;ve chosen the dark side of human history and nature, in the sense that they&#8217;ve chosen to be allies of power, rather than champions of justice; partisans of the alpha dogs of society, instead of advocates for the rights of the rest of the pack; apologists of a status quo based on classism and racial discrimination, rather than upholders of the dream of a more egalitarian social order.\n \n But certainly not all conservatives are venal politicians who&#8217;ve been co-opted by corporate lobbyists, what about blue-collar folks who are staunch conservatives? Why in the world would any workingperson in his/her right mind ever support the pro-business policies of conservatism? The simple answer is the psychology of identification. One needn&#8217;t have money & power, or be in the sack with the rich & powerful, to psychologically side with them, identifying with the alphas of society still has a payoff in terms of what it does for one&#8217;s self-esteem, i.e. the boosting effect it has on the ole ego. \n \n Which is to say that the proto-human caveman tucked away in the recesses of our 21st century psyches still prizes strength, superiority, and dominance, and admires those who possess these primitive virtues. Today of course such brute values as strength & dominance take the more sophisticated form of &#8220;success&#8221; in business. The wealthy businessman and boss is very much the new alpha male and clan chieftain. Instead of wielding a caveman&#8217;s club though, today&#8217;s dominant individuals wield capital and the clout it bestows. But today&#8217;s dominant capitalists are still the ideal to aspire to of our inner Neanderthal, and still enjoy much respect from lower-status members of society&#8217;s extended clan. \n \n In the case of conservatives, we find this appreciation of dominance becoming more of a pronounced element in their attitudes and worldview. The conservative waxes philosophical about one&#8217;s supposed God-given right to be a dominant capitalist, to exercise economic power over the less fortunate, and to do so free of interference from the weak members of society who try to assert their own rights through the democratic means of government. The conservative, you see, is really just a downright mental, ideological sycophant of the Caesars of capitalism&#8217;s own &#8220;evil empire&#8221;! \n \n An empire whose chief evils are of course the classics, socioeconomic and racial inequality. Capitalism and conservatism, I&#8217;m sorry to say, are linked-at-the-hip pernicious isms producing the ongoing ugliness of racism in all its various forms, negrophopia, Hispanophobia, anti-immigrationism, Islamophobia, the First World&#8217;s wars to dominate the oil and economic resources of differently-pigmented Third World peoples in the name of bringing them mighty Western whitey&#8217;s democracy, etc. \n \n At home and abroad then, capitalism & conservatism have created a world system that entrenches the predominantly white capitalist elite&#8217;s power, and by extension &#8220;white power&#8221;, in economics and politics. They, capitalism & conservatism, have established a kind of socioeconomic, poor vs. affluent apartheid that more and more, not less and less, falls along racial lines, the same racial lines as the original apartheid. Capitalism & conservatism wear black hats, or should I say white sheets, in the story of racism, and the sooner people of goodwill who would like to see society evolve beyond racism realize this, the better.\n \n emoticon_smile",

   "Thank you for your feedback. Here are some thoughts.\n \n I certainly don't claim to be a psychic, but I do know from replies such as yours what most libertarians reading this post are in all likelihood thinking, you're thinking \"Hey, I'm no racist because I'm not a hater, and as a libertarian I'm certainly not a hater\". This is of course a rather common and simplistic misconception, i.e. that being a racist = being a hatemonger. Nope, there's another sense in which one can be a racist, a sense that's more true to the word. One can be a racist in the sense of being a part of the problem, rather than a part of the solution of society's structural racism.\n \n And, what's more, one can be a part of society's systemic racism by passive participation, by being an apathetic accessory. This is certainly the case with quite a few conservatives-libertarians, after all. Well, folks on the right of the ole political divide haven't exactly been known for their passionate support of the civil rights movement, or for the concept of social justice for the disadvantaged!\n \n No, of course Caucasians in general, and conservatives in particular, aren't prone to be malignant and vicious fans of racial enmity and strife. The majority of whites who are a party to the problem and share in the social sin of racism are such not because they have a little Klansman lurking in their unconsciousness, but rather simply because they are utterly unsympathetic to the real socioeconomic plight of the victims of racism.\n \n Why are so many white individuals so insensitively indifferent about racial injustice? Well, of course many human beings simply have an unsympathetic psychological nature. Others, however, due to their unsympathetic psychological nature, gravitate toward conservatism and libertarianism, toward ideologies that make them more hardcore about being unsympathetic. This is because conservatism-libertarianism provides cognitive justifications, excuses for unsympathetic types to withdraw, to withdraw their sympathy and compassion from aggrieved people of color, to withdraw from being a constructive partaker in the societal process of resolving the societal issue of race in a progressive fashion.\n \n Instead, conservatives and libertarians have a whole, prefabricated intellectual construct that legitimizes their preference to remain in dishonest denial and pathetically cry: \"Wah, wah, wah, reverse racism! Boo-hoo and woe is me, I'm such a victim of affirmative action!\", and so on. Yes, in an ironic twist conservative white individuals arrogate and usurp the role of victim for themselves, while at the same time criticizing minorities for having a self-defeating victim mentality! Now this is what I call a case of being hypocritical with chutzpah.\n \n Oh well, the upshot is that conservatism-libertarianism is a worldview that reflects, rationalizes, ratifies, and reinforces an unsympathetic attitude into a full-blown doctrinaire system of belief. A system of belief that is not about race or promoting racial hatred per se, but that does promote a defensive and resentful disbelief in the racial injustice endured by non-Caucasoid members of society. A system of belief that causes its adherents to turn a deaf ear to the cries of social pain and righteous indignation of minorities. A system of belief that often makes its indoctrinees callous and insulting in their opinions on race. A system of belief that promotes government policies that take us in the regressive direction of perpetuating and worsening, as opposed to addressing and ameliorating, race problems.\n \n Conservatism-libertarianism, that is, is an ideology of deplorable racial ignorance, not commendable color blindness. Conservatism, and its peevish proponents of the delusionally unsympathetic fiction that racism is a thing of the past, in fact are in a very big way, in a ginormous way, a part of the problem. In this sense conservatism-libertarianism is very much tarnished by racism.\n \n Libertarianism of course takes the tack of disengagement with society in general, embracing an extreme every-man-for-himself-in-the-free-for-all-of-the-free-market individualism in which we're all asocially self-owning units with no ethical responsibility to the greater good of society. This intellectual attitude and dodge of capitalistically self-interested disengagement quite transparently allows libertarians to unsympathetically disengage from the misfortunes of minorities, to advocate abolishing such meager social mercies as food stamps and Medicaid, and to advocate utter neglect of the social problems stemming from racism, on the pretext of the theory that the forces of the \"free market\" will swoop in and right all wrongs. Mm-hmm, libertarianism is all about rationalizingly divorcing oneself from any obligation to social justice, and therefore is antithetical to racial justice, is de facto a part of the problem and ethically discredited by its own apathetic form of racism.\n \n Yes, conservatism in general has its own racial issues that make it a force standing against progress on race, and that give it an all too strong family resemblance with the haters on its lunatic fringe. Just last night I saw a segment on The Ed Show about how conservatives in Congress have pressured the Department of Homeland Security to lay off of hate-spewing ultra-right-wing groups that are potential terror threats, and of course the obvious explanation is that conservatives recognize their family resemblance with these extremist groups. Yep, conservatives recognize them as kooky cousins whom they'd like to keep in the attic, and by giving them any attention the Department of Homeland Security threatens to out the ugliness at the heart of conservatism. Instead of finding the integrity and moral courage to face this ugliness, conservative have placed us all in jeopardy by nixing law enforcement's ability to keep tabs on virulent and vicious rightist haters.\n \n Well, what this all points up is that conservatives are dealing with the question of race very much in bad faith, and need to grow some moral you-know-what.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n :)\n\n \n Kudos. Most well-said!",

The race card is the mark of an amateur.\n\n \n Excuse me..but examples of black people \"playing the race card\", are rare, few and far between. \n \n Race Is Not A Card, Its A Reality Clutch Magazine\n \n \n \nThe \"race card\" is a concept that has been used to silence people of color who attempt to speak out when they feel that race has been used unfairly in determining how people are treated. It is one of the most dangerous weapons in the White privilege toolbox, for it implies that a non-POC would know better when something is truly racist than someone who is constantly subjected to racism. That said, it isn't that people of color can never be wrong about denouncing something as racism, but that they should be treated with a level of deference when expressing their concerns. Instead of having something dismissed as someone pulling a card, these complaints should be respectfully analyzed and received. If someone is truly committed to being non-racist, the appropriate reaction to a charge of racism is \"I don't feel like what I did was racist. Can you help me understand why you feel that way?\", not accusing someone of using race to be manipulative or deceitful.\n \n But, alas, in a world of White privilege where is the incentive to say \"You're right, that was racist of me\"? or \"I didn't mean to be racially insensitive\"? And for even those who pride themselves in being non-racist, where would a non-Black person be taught the difference? If racism doesn't negatively impact you in a very obvious way, it's quite a task to say, \"hey, let me learn about this so I make sure that I'm not out here supporting an unfair system of advantage that benefits me.\"\n \n It's an amazingly duplicitous thing, to flip racism around so that the person who is the victim now looks like the guilty party because of their observations of someone's behavior. A Black woman who feels that she has been passed over for a raise because of her background may be told that she is 'pulling the race card' and that racism will never end so long as people like her \"see race in everything.\" But how can you not see something that is constantly there?\n\n And to your response I say..walks, talks, and quacks like a duck...it's not a chicken. Ron Paul's very son, Rand, is in favor of repealing the 14th amendment, no less. Who are you trying to sell wolf tickets to?",

Who are you trying to sell wolf tickets to?\n\n \n Even if we pretend for a moment that both the article or your critique of Rand Paul were even remotely on topic, your argument is still fundamentally flawed.\n \n The article was nothing but the author whining about \"white privilege\", something that doesn't exist anymore. Whites are discriminated against more than any other race in everything from hiring to college admissions in the name of \"diversity\". Whites are the only race that are not allowed to be proud of their heritage. On top of all that, there are more racial double standards that apply to whites than any other race. I'm not going to write an article B!tching and moaning about all of the \"white discrimination\", because I don't really care. It's not a big deal. I will not, however, sit here and read an article that tells me pulling the race card is somehow OK. There is no justification for it in this day and age. \n \n Drop it and make an actual argument. You haven't quoted Ron Paul once, nor have you discredited him in any way. All you've given me is a whiny article and a fact about someone related to him. Both are totally irrelevant.",
