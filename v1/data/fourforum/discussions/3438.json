   "\"When contemplating college liberals, you really regret once again that John Walker is not getting the death penalty. We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate liberals, by making them realize that they can be killed, too. Otherwise, they will turn out to be outright traitors.\"\n ------------\n This is an oldy but a goody. It's been quoted by other sites, but I'll include a bit more context as an added bonus. This is from a series of video clips from FOX HANNITY & COLMES, shown on June 22, 2001. (Which show the original clip was from, I can't tell.)\n \n COULTER: I take the biblical idea. God gave us the earth.\n \n PETER FENN (Democratic strategist): Oh, OK.\n \n COULTER: We have dominion over the plants, the animals, the trees.\n \n FENN: This is a great idea.\n \n COULTER: God says, \"Earth is yours. Take it. Rape it. It's yours.\"\n \n FENN: Terrific. We're Americans, so we should consume as much of the earth's resources...\n \n COULTER: Yes! Yes.\n \n FENN: ... as fast as we possibly can.\n \n COULTER: As opposed to living like the Indians.\n \n So Jesus advocated strip mining, ozone depletion, toxic waste spills, and polluted waterways. Who knew? \n -------------\n \"My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building.\"\n -------------\n \"The swing voters---I like to refer to them as the idiot voters because they don't have set philosophical principles. You're either a liberal or you're a conservative if you have an IQ above a toaster. \"---Beyond the News, Fox News Channel, 6/4/00\n (Makes sense, don't it?)\n --------------\n We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war.\n --------------\n Many more are here:http://users.rcn.com/skutsch/anticoulter/index.html\n \n \n .",

   "The two-party system is stifling the progress of political ideas. Both parties are gradually becoming more similar, both trying to move to \"centrism\" and developing dull, uninspired platforms. Look up any third party's platform and you'll find it brimming with new ideas. Look up a big party's platform and you'll find mud.\n \n Two parties are not enough to represent the opinions of 300 million people.\n \n I've heard that the two-party system is a result of our voting system. We have a winner-take-all system in this country, where the party with a mere plurality in a district gets 100% of the power from that district. As a result, parties are encouraged to merge and agglomerate (so they can combine their votes and win the plurality) until only two parties remain. And the two parties both move towards centrism, leading to a one-idea dictatorship in disguise.",
