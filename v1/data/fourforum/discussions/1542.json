   "This is a good piece about America's so-called \"allies\" in Europe. The title is \"America's Antagonistic Allies\"\n The author is George Handlery\n \n http://www.politicallyright.com/article155.htm \n \n This is a quote from the article:\n \n \"America and a number of her nominal allies, first and foremost the states of the Western section of the European continent, glance at the vicissitudes of the world through differently colored lenses. This makes popular attitudes fundamental. To many Americans who wish to qualify as part of the cultured cluster, Europe has a \"snob-value.\" America's view of Europe is determined by a prejudice that those sophisticated Continentals are worldly, politically wise and as such superior to barefooted US clod hoppers. To hell with the blunderers which made two world wars possible.\"",
