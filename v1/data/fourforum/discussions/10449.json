   "This post will philosphically unravel the issue of common descent:\n \n When all the dust is settled, when all the layers are peeled away, the thoery of evolution is a theory that does away with the individual. Period. \n \n According to ToE the individual simply does not exist. It is not capable, it is not intelligent, it is not dynamic, heck, it's not even alive or distinctive from non-life:\n \n http://www.uic.edu/classes/bios/bios101/life.PDF\n \n There is no hard-and-fast distinction between a life and nonlife. Early scientists\n thought there was a \"vital principle\", called quintessence or pneuma, that was\n present in every living thing, and absent in everything nonliving. This has not\n proven to be true. A growing conviction, intuitively felt by many biologists, is that\n no clear line can be drawn between the living and the non-living. The bridge\n between what is and is not obviously alive consists of a range of problematic\n agents, including viruses, prions, and transposable genes, which appear to be\n living at times and non-living at other times.\n \n \n And sticking with this nutball concept, (sidestepping the obervable FACT that life is truly distinct and different than non-life), any and every evolutionist book will tell you that only populations evolve - that individuals do not and cannot evolve because individuals are not real entities. And as you've probably heard before that only populations evolve, did it ever dawn on you that the evolutionist authors you hear this from never - but never - explain why this is or what the alternative would mean? They're certainly quick to tell you that only populations evolve, but they never quite explore the ramifications for the alternative! But I'm here to tell you what the ramifications are.\n \n You see, back in the old days, atheists determined that they needed a naturalistic orgin/evolution of life. But for them, intelligent mental processes were excluded from this picture because as materialists, they only accepted physical explanations, and that meant they had to exclude any and all metaphysical explanations. Materialists simply hate the idea that life is an abstract, undefinable, unmeasurable process. Somehow, some way, the framers of materialistic ToE just HAD to make life a materialistic, definable \"thing\" and cram it into a materialistic, definable theory. \n \n But first they had some important business to do: First they had to take the mind, which is the epitome of abstraction, and totally eliminate it from public view and make it a non-topic in the world science. And for years and years, atheists/evolutionists looked for a replacement for the mind because they needed something magical, a physical, biological alternative to the mind....something capable of changing over time as ecological and social conditions changed, and then upon these changes, miraculously transform organisms. \n \n Well, of course we all know now that they found what they were looking for. Evolutionists soon crowned genes as the Kings of life.\n \n Ever since evolutionists found these magical little \"things\" called genes, they've made a concerted, all-out propaganda blitz on everyone in society, with the goal of making people believe that whatever it is that makes them who they are is a result of what's \"in the genes\"....Not only that, but the way they got here was not because of anything metaphysical, but by way of changes in genes -- because ultimately, all adaptations in nature, all evolution, was a result not of changes in minds, but changes in genes. \n \n So, individual minds were out - and gene pools were in. If it ever came out or got exposed, however, that adaptation was all \"in the mind\" instead of all \"in the genes,\" then ToE, materialism, the theory of common descent, and even atheism itself would all be intellectually shot. So make no mistake - this is very important -- it ALL boils down to evolutionists denying the internal biological abilities of individuals. Therefore, for common descent to be true, individual organisms must be passive and unable to change or adjust biologically to changing environments.\n \n So why is this? Why does common descent rely on the denial of the individual?\n \n If the mind or some other undiscovered internal, intelligent metaphysical processes are responsible for adaptation to changing environments, then that would mean physical adaptations would have absolutely nothing to do with a physical build-up of an organism... instead of showing that the physical genes changed the physical body over time, it would instead show that the mind changed over time, simply bringing the physical body along with it.\n \n According to ToE, common descent is based on the premise that internal accidents physically change organisms into other kinds of organisms....but if the opposite is true, that internal, purposeful mental processes cause change, it would also mean the opposite: that physical change is rooted in the mind and is simply a way for an organism to stay who it is without going extinct. Put another way, change would merely allow an organism to stay put, to stay alive.\n \n There's one more reality here....if mental processes were responsible for biological change, It would also mean that the mind is the glue that holds life together and makes the organism what it is. Instead of organisms simply being the end result of an accumulation of eons of randomly-generated physical parts, the physical organism is end result of the mind, which creates and organizes its physical parts.\n \n This reality of the mind, of course, leaves a gaping hole as to its origin - where did it come from....?",

ToE is theory that relies on the scientific cop-out.\n\n \n Um yes, Galapagos finches have been shown to be genuine species that produce viable and fertile offspring. Their genetics have been studied. I recommend, for example, the work by Peter Grant and colleagues: Ecology and Evolution of Darwin's Finches. It's true they are closely related species, and hybridisation is often possible, but the species are real.\n \n It is not always easy to define species when they are closely related (i.e. recently diverged), and taxonomical biologists occasionally disagree, but that doesn't mean the species concept is invalid, and usually, there is no difficulty in telling separate species apart. \n \n Even you won't argue, I presume -- well, I could be wrong about that -- that a single cat could evolve itself into a dog if only it thought about it intelligently enough.\n \n \nbut to answer your challenge, since it is known that finches' beaks \"evolved\" by way of a hormone-induced gene expression and not by mutations, it's pretty clear that the individuals themselves did the evolving. If you are going to call these different varieties of fiches different \"species\" then the challenge is met.\n\n \n Um no. The individuals didn't evolve new beak sizes and shapes. They have the one they are stuck with. If you leave a finch with a diet appropriate to some other beak shape, it isn't going to grow a different beak -- it's going to try to subsist on the diet with the beak it has. Different species have different sizes and shapes of beak, and their frequency changes with local climate. Individual species can also have a great variation in the beak size of different individuals, and scientists have followed the differential reproductive success of such variants in response to climate change (individuals were never reported to have altered their own beak size). The original ancestors would have had progeny with variable beak sizes and shapes which eventually went their separate genetic ways to generate the mostly separate finch gene pools that Darwin first observed, and that have been confirmed by genetic analysis today.\n \n \npersonally, I would probably guess (yes, I have to guess since science won't do its job) that all finches are of the same \"species\" or kind, they have just branched out from the original finch kind to develop new traits and abilities based on ecologicial conditions.\n\n \n Science did its job quite well in this case.

   "And here is Peter Grant's website with a summary of his three decades of work on Galapagos finches:\n \n http://www.eeb.princeton.edu/FACULTY/Grant_P/grantPeter.html\n \n \nThe thirteen species evolved from a common ancestor in the last few million years. They display striking patterns of morphological and behavioral variation, and some populations are exceptionally variable. To investigate the reasons for these patterns my students and I have concentrated on four topics, and have demonstrated the following. First, there is much heritable variation in populations, partly as a result of hybridization. Second, this genetic variation is occasionally subject to the forces of both natural and sexual selection, as the climatic environment fluctuates between extreme conditions. These two facts mean that populations are currently labile, evolutionarily, which is fortunate because it has enabled us to estimate the minimal forces of selection involved in the transformation of one species to another. Third, the composition of finch communities is strongly determined by patterns of variation in food supply among islands, and by competition among species for that food supply. Evolution of character displacement caused by interspecific competition has been observed and measured. Fourth, finch species recognize each other by their appearance and by their song, as demonstrated by experiments with models and tape-recorded song. Integrating all this information we can say that the primary driving forces in the adaptive radiation of the finches were ecological, with reproductive isolation between newly formed species being largely an incidental consequence of ecological divergence.\n \n Current goals include identifying the causes, frequency and fitness consequences of hybridization by an analysis of pedigrees, uncovering the molecular genetic control of beak development and the origin of differences between species, and seeking a better understanding of the pattern of Darwin's Finch phylogenetic history through an analysis of microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA variation. Achieving these goals should throw light on two generalizations: how complex communities develop from simple ones, and how microevolutionary processes can be used to account for macroevolutionary patterns.\n",

They do not say anything about whether or not the actions of individuals steer that process. That's a hugely important distinction.\n \n Populations evolve - but individuals migrate, try out new behaviours, select mates, survive and reproduce or die in the attempt. The effect their individual efforts have upon the genome of the species is evolution.\n \n Whales, for example, weren't helplessly shoved into the sea by their genes. They were land mammals which exploited a marine environment, and over considerable aeons the most successful phenotypes, and then the most successful variants of those phenotypes, and so on, made the various species what they are today.

I hate latin) not taken the plunge, there would be no whales.\n \n The problem with your black-and-white, all-or-nothing strawman battle between darwinism and - well, frankly I don't know what; seemingly any detritus that comes to hand - is that it's a false dichotomy. It's not a straight choice between 100% genetic determinism and 100% intelligently guided organismic evolution. In reality there are many factors in play, and organismic-level decisions are unquestionably a part of it all.

Anyway, let's look at what I wrote:\n \n \nI'm sorry to break this to you, SS, but all your quotes say is that populations evolve.\n\n \n A statement you attempted to disagree with by saying:\n \n \nMy links were showing you that you are wrong with that statement, that every evolutionist out there says that only populations evolve.\n\n \n Is it just me, or are you calling me wrong and then repeating exactly what I just said to back you up? :)\n \n Are individuals dynamic and self-adapting? To the extent I've already described, yes: they can be possessed of a phenotype capable of adapting to certain specific demands, and depending upon their individual level of intelligence they can also migrate, exploit new niches, try new behaviour. By doing this they will strongly influence - to put things simply - what counts as 'fittest'. None of this is the least bit controversial, none of this is anything any biologist would disagree with. \n \n However, there is no evidence at all to suggest that the genetic variety we observe in a species is a result of the deliberate 'encoding' of intelligently devised organismic traits. So how does it get there? How does the distribution of that variety change? How will that changing distribution influence the progressive stacking of genetic traits as they appear? How does this all tie in with organismic-level dynamism? That's the purview of the ToE.\n \n The reason we talk about evolution happening at the population level is that (assuming an already varied genetic profile for the species) it can continue without any member of that population experiencing any further mutations. Changing breeding patterns influenced by environmental change, predation, sexual selection, migration, niche exploitation and so forth - all these factors can contribute to skewing the distribution of alleles and rapidly bringing new combinations to prominence in a self-reinforcing cycle. \n \n Do you appreciate the point? It's no use talking about evolution at the individual level when so much of evolution is about the novel combination of genes an organism gets when its parents mate. Did that organism 'evolve' that novel combination? Not really. Did it 'mutate'? No. It hasn't done anything, yet. Nevertheless, it has a chance to contribute to the potential gene pool for the next generation.\n \n We talk about evolution occurring at the population level because it's the most sensible level at which to discuss it. But please stop trying to twist that into a denial of the influence individuals have.",
