That will help curtail frivilous lawsuits paid for by a % of potential award basis. \n 2. A national set of healthcare guidelines that, if followed, absolve a doctor/hospital from liability.\n 3. A national prescription drug protocol that puts the FDA in charge of drug evaluations and once approved, absolves big pharma from future liability.\n \n One of the biggest costs in medicine is defensive or CYA medicine.

   "I think maybe the time has come to elevate health care at least to the same level as Police and Fire Protection, Education and the Military.

Let me expand upon it for you.\n Does anyone expect the Post Office to mail their packages for free?\n Do they expect that being poor gives them carte blanche to not have to pay for any goods and services because there will always be others able to pick up their tabs?Do people who have never worked a day in their life get Social Security? \n And I'm not sure about where you live, but here in Michigan, we pay state, county and local taxes, including property taxes that cover the costs of Police, Fire and Schools. As for funding the Military, we do that through FIT. So, we are, in essence, hiring a cop, fireman, teacher and soldier as we need them. We just don't hire them directly.",
