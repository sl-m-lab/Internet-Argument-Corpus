   "One of my biggest problems with the theory of evolution is the concept of selection. It is just incredible to me that so many people accept the basic premise that evolutionists put out there, which is that there is enough variation within a species that would genetically disallow a portion of the population to breed. This basic premise often gets glossed over, but I just do not buy it. \n \n http://www.photocentral.org/Spring05...f_Monarchs.jpg\n \n Here is a picture of some Monarch Butterflys. I simply do not accept that there is one in that group who is unable to breed. Humans are the same way. Oh, you might eventually come across a vegetable who isn't able to breed, but I submit that 99.99% of all humans can do so. The only reason someone wouldn't breed would be because they've either chosen not to, or because they haven't had the fortune of meeting the right person. But genetics has nothing to do with it. There are just as many females in the population as males. Therefore, everyone has an equal chance -- no matter how \"inferior\" one might be.\n \n If evolutionists were honest, they would admit this simple truth. And since this IS the simple truth, this destroys the silly myth that humans ever evolved from something other than what they've always been. Monkeys, no doubt, are no different than humans in this respect. Monkeys don't generally have problems with their private parts being functional. Each member of the population certainly is able to breed....which makes evolution an impossible crapshoot.\n \n And here's something else I don't get. Evolutionists' concept of selection basically means \"survival of the fittest.\" But the interesting thing is evolutionists refer to this survival of the fittest on the level of the INDIVIDUAL. They say that members within the same species are in competition with each other. Richard Dawkins calls us -- and our genes -- selfish.\n \n But what's REAL truth? The real truth is evolutionists can't even get that right. The real truth is that members of the same species almost always work together for the benefit of the population. All you have to do is look at nature: Lions and hyenas and buffalo and crocodiles and fish and ants and bees and lots of other animals work TOGETHER. They work in teams. There is no fierce competition within the group to survive. The REAL survival of the fittest happens between different populations of animals. This is where the competition really occurs. This is why natural selection -- the ability to go on to breed -- on the level of the population is actually non-random. But guess what...evolutionists call NS on the populational level random! This is despite the fact that there are real variations between species that make a real difference in fitness. In contrast, evolutionists laughingly look at the miniscule differences between individuals of a population and dare call those who survive the \"fittest\" -- when actually, since each member of the population is almost exactly the same, the \"fittest\" are actually just the luckiest\n \n Here's an example of how NS is nonrandom on the populational level: When i was a kid back in the 70s we used to have lots of big red ants around our house. They made these big, huge mounds, and these big red ants ruled our neighborhood and city. However, back in the 80s we were invaded by fire ants -- which are smaller, yet more agressive ants. Nowdays, there are no more big red ants. Instead, all we have are fire ants. Where are the big red ants? I don't know -- I never see them anymore. The fire ants obviously ran them off or killed them. This is a perfect example of real life nonrandom natural selection in action.\n \n Yet evolutionists tell us that evolution could never happen the same way twice. And the reason they say that -- one of them -- is that NS on the level of the population is random....which makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever. With a constantly changing environment it is so obvious to me that different groups of animals would do better in different environments. This is where competition really happens.\n \n The whole evolutionist theory goes against common sense like this at every turn. None of it makes any sense on any level. S",

   "\"Evolutionists have Natural Selection Backwards\"\n\n Crackpot suggests that the environment changes to suit organisms! More at 11.\n \n \n Unsurprisingly, SS has abandoned another thread and -- unbelievably -- started another showing even more ignorance of basic biology. I didn't think it could be done. How silly of me.\n \n Well, I could just post the above, but SS would no doubt jump up and down having a hissy fit about how I \"wasn't able\" to counter his points. So here's a short list:\n [*]Selection does not require inability to breed, only differential breeding rates.[*]Ring species demonstrate precisely what SS asserts doesn't exist.[*]Selection is not survival of the fittest. Although much better descriptions exist, it could better be described as \"statistically preferential perpetuation of the fittest.\"[*]Many primates fight within their own tribes to gain dominance. Infanticide is common. Do you consider this \"for the benefit of the population\"?[*]Even were there universal cooperation among populations, that wouldn't prevent differences in fitness.[*]SS provides no quote or citation for the alleged assertion that [a certain occurrance of] evolution could never happen the same way twice.\n I would also like to point out that once again we have a broken link that shows that not only is supersport simply copying and pasting his baloney, his common sense is so lacking that after being called on this numerous times, he doesn't even pay attention to the problem.\n \n Run, SS, run!",

   "Normally, I never get into these evolution debates, mainly because I have pretty much no background in science (heck, I haven't even taken a biology course since high school). But this has to be the most inept argument I have ever heard.\n \n \nIt is just incredible to me that so many people accept the basic premise that evolutionists put out there, which is that there is enough variation within a species that would genetically disallow a portion of the population to breed.\n\n \n Who has ever made this claim? Please, show me, because I have never once heard it. Of course most individuals are physically capable of producing offspring. Natural selection is dependant upon which individuals will pass their genetic information on to the next generation, and that is determined by at least two factors that I can think of at the moment: 1.) An individual being able to survive long enough to find a mate, and 2.) Actually being able to find a mate and produce offspring, which brings me to my next point:\n \n \nAll you have to do is look at nature: Lions and hyenas and buffalo and crocodiles and fish and ants and bees and lots of other animals work TOGETHER. They work in teams. There is no fierce competition within the group to survive.\n\n \n Again, you are mistaken. ALL of these groups compete for multiple things, and I'll give you real, concrete examples you might even be able to find watching Animal Planet.\n \n 1.) Animals compete for mates ALL THE TIME. Have you never seen male lions fighting each other, or elk, hyenas, etc, etc? They fight, the stronger one wins, and the female selects the victor to be her mate, and they produce offspring that likely would grow up to be stronger than those produced by the other male.\n \n 2.) Animals compete for resources ALL THE TIME. Nature moves in cycles. Regions experience dry periods, wet periods, cold periods, hot periods, etc. Therefore, viable sources for food fluctuate from season to season. At one point, for example, there may be more predators than prey. With not enough food to go around for entire populations of predators, only those with the ability to go long periods of time without food, or can more effectively find food before other individuals in the population, will survive and those that cannot will likely die. When you get into animals that live in groups (packs, herds, etc.) you will find that competition occurs between these groups. (I am reminded of a famous scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey)\n \n That's really all I have to offer to this debate, hopefully somebody will help verify/strengthen my points, seeing as I'm hardly the expert. supersport, I have been watching your posting strategy, and frankly you seem to be shooting yourself in the foot; most of the things you claim as \"facts\" are downright false. I genuinely want to hear where you get such claims, but I fear you'll just ignore me like you ignore everybody else who makes a point. Please, address my points. If not, you can expect a PM from me. I just want to know where you get this stuff.",

This basic premise often gets glossed over, but I just do not buy it. \n\n I do buy it. It doesn't seem incredible to me. Also, long introductions without evidence do not seem necessary to me...\n \nhttp://www.photocentral.org/Spring05...f_Monarchs.jpg\n \n Here is a picture of some Monarch Butterflys. I simply do not accept that there is one in that group who is unable to breed. \n\n 404. Please post relevant, unbroken links.\n As for butterflies, the full grown, living ones can probably breed, but the others can't.\n \nHumans are the same way. Oh, you might eventually come across a vegetable who isn't able to breed, but I submit that 99.99% of all humans can do so. \n\n Again, they must be alive. Previously, you submitted that there are many problems with society and life or whatever. Could it be that some people might be able to survive those problems? Could it be that those survivors would be the ones to reproduce?\n \nThe only reason someone wouldn't breed would be because they've either chosen not to, or because they haven't had the fortune of meeting the right person. But genetics has nothing to do with it. There are just as many females in the population as males. Therefore, everyone has an equal chance -- no matter how \"inferior\" one might be.\n\n That is generally true.\n However, have you heard of a disease called AIDS? Some people are resistant to that disease. Guess what? They are reproducing more than those who aren't resistant.\n \nIf evolutionists were honest, they would admit this simple truth. And since this IS the simple truth, this destroys the silly myth that humans ever evolved from something other than what they've always been. Monkeys, no doubt, are no different than humans in this respect. Monkeys don't generally have problems with their private parts being functional. \n\n Generally... And when one does?\n \nEach member of the population certainly is able to breed....which makes evolution an impossible crapshoot.\n\n Would make, that is. However, not all members of the population are able to breed.\n Should we make this a thread for posting examples of natural selection? That might be fun.\n \n An example: rats are often a problem. The solution? Introduce rat poison.\n Unfortunately, some rats are immune to the poison. You should have guessed it- those rats reproduce, and the others don't (as much).\n \n Another: elephants use their tusks on predators and for ritual purposes (attracting mates). Some elephants lack tusks or have shorter tusks.\n However, when poachers kill the elephants with the biggest tusks, the elephants with smaller tusks (or no tusks) reproduce more.\n \nAnd here's something else I don't get. Evolutionists' concept of selection basically means \"survival of the fittest.\" \n\n From wikipedia:\n \"The phrase is a metaphor, not a scientific description; and it is not generally used by biologists, who almost exclusively prefer to use the phrase 'natural selection'.\"\n \nBut the interesting thing is evolutionists refer to this survival of the fittest on the level of the INDIVIDUAL. \n\n Actually, evolution occurs on the level of the population: individuals don't change, but populations do. See the examples above.\n \nThey say that members within the same species are in competition with each other.\n\n They are: those that survive better reproduce more. Members of a species can die if other members have better food/light/attention/camaflouge.\n \nBut what's REAL truth? The real truth is evolutionists can't even get that right. The real truth is that members of the same species almost always work together for the benefit of the population. \n\n Almost?\n Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population.\n \nAll you have to do is look at nature: Lions and hyenas and buffalo and crocodiles and fish and ants and bees and lots of other animals work TOGETHER. They work in teams. \n\n True.\n \nThere is no fierce competition within the group to survive. \n\n False. See above.\n \nThe REAL survival of the fittest happens between different populations of animals. \n\n That is not the only \"REAL\" evolution. It does occur within a population.\n \nThis is where the competition really occurs. This is why natural selection -- the ability to go on to breed -- on the level of the population is actually non-random. \n\n Wow! Supersport got something right!\n \nBut guess what...evolutionists call NS on the populational level random! \n\n Well, he can't continue getting things right for long...\n \nThis is despite the fact that there are real variations between species that make a real difference in fitness. \n\n Hmmm... He may get things right only when he thinks getting it right contradicts evolution...\n \nIn contrast, evolutionists laughingly look at the miniscule differences between individuals of a population and dare call those who survive the \"fittest\" -- when actually, since each member of the population is almost exactly the same, the \"fittest\" are actually just the luckiest\n\n They are not exactly the same. See the examples above. It is not random.\n \nHere's an example of how NS is nonrandom on the populational level: \n\n We already accept that it is. You don't have to convince us.\n However, consider what this does to your argument that natural selection is random.\n \nYet evolutionists tell us that evolution could never happen the same way twice. \n\n I know of a similar argument that could be misinterpreted:\n Evolution producing what exists today could have gone any one of millions of ways. However, it isn't much surprise that what we have came out of it, just like it wouldn't be a surprise for a random number generator to come up with 475475.339: something had to come out, and something did.\n \n Chances are, you are referring to that argument.\n \nAnd the reason they say that -- one of them -- is that NS on the level of the population is random....which makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever. With a constantly changing environment it is so obvious to me that different groups of animals would do better in different environments. This is where competition really happens.\n\n He only understands natural selection when he belives that it goes against what is accepted by scientists.\n \nThe whole evolutionist theory goes against common sense like this at every turn. None of it makes any sense on any level. S\n\n Actually, it is based on the \"common sense\" that you put down. Thank you for posting.",

If someone was curious about extinction and different theories then they might like this book. I was hoping it would be more about extinction and dinosaurs. Anyway the author did a good job explaining his thoughts on extinction. It was interesting seeing how the author kind of explained how extinction could be as simple as bad luck, a species just being in the wrong place at the wrong time\n \n You are going to lose this debate......selection on the individual level according to evolutionists is nonrandom -- but selection on the species level is random.......\n \n \"It is not surprising then, that non-punctuationists tend to believe selection as working at no higher level than the individual organism.

   "Is Evolution a fact????? Well let's watch these two dudes battle it out. First of up is Ernst Mayr from What Evolution Is:\n \n \"Is Evolution a fact? Evolution is not merely an idea, a theory, or a concept, but is the name of a process in nature, the occurrence of which can be documented by mountains of evidence that nobody has been able to refute. Some of this evidence was summarized in Chapters 1-3. It is now actually misleading to refer to evolution as a theory, considering the massive evidence that has been discovered over the last 140 years documenting its existence. Evolution is no longer a thoery; it is simply fact.\"\n \n Ok...so now that Mayr has told us that evolution is a fact and that there is mountains of evidence -- some of which he has presented in his book -- let's see what what Gould has to say:\n \n \n \"I well remember how the synthetic theory beguiled me with its unifying power when I was a graduate student in the mid-1960's. Since then I have been watching it slowly unravel as a universal description of evolution. The molecular assault came first, followed quickly by renewed attention to unorthodox theories of speciation and by challenges at the level of macroevolution itself. I have been reluctant to admit it-since beguiling is often forever-but if Mayr's characterization of the synthetic theory is accurate, then that theory, as a general proposition, is effectively dead, despite its persistence as textbook orthodoxy.\" Gould\n \n Ok......does anyone now see why evolutionists are impossible to believe? They trip over themselves at every turn. They don't know which end is up or which end is down. They don't know if evolution happens rapidly, slowly, randomly, with direction, with or without selection, from which sweaty monkey we evolved...etc etc etc. Heck, they don't even know if genetic accomodation is officially part of their religion. Ask them -- no one will tell you. Neither will they tell you if evolution happens phyletically or punctually...(is that a word?) How hard is that to answer?\n \n All they know is that God didn't create us. That's about all they can agree on.",

   "Is Evolution a fact????? \n\n \n Yes, both Gould and Mayr agree, as does every other biologist.\n \n \nOk......does anyone now see why evolutionists are impossible to believe?\n\n \n No, and your cut and paste quotes certainlydon't show us that. Mayr says evolution is a fact based on the evidence, Gould doesn't dispute this. Gould does dispute Mayr's characterization of the synthetic theory but nowhere in the quote you posted does he dispute the fact that evolution happens.\n \n As a matter of fact, he's what Gould has to say about the fact of evolution and creationists constant attempts to twist his words on the subject:\n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html \n \n \"Faced with these facts of evolution and the philosophical bankruptcy of their own position, creationists rely upon distortion and innuendo to buttress their rhetorical claim. If I sound sharp or bitter, indeed I am-for I have become a major target of these practices.\"\n \n Gould states numerous times evolution is a fact. The quote you posted from him does not refute this position, try reading for comprehension for a change.\n And you fall into the category of creationist who \"rely upon distortion and innuendo to buttress their rhetorical claim.\"\n \n Once again, your nonsense is exposed as nonsense, you're fooling no one but yourself.",

   "Nope. Not part of evolutionary theory. It would be stupid to claim that increased genetic variability would \"disallow\" any portion of the population from breeding.\nyes it is...that's the definition of selection -- that there are variations in the population (genetic variations) some of which are more beneficial than others.\nWhile it may be true that some individuals possess characters that are more beneficial than others, that isn't the definition of selection. Shouldn't you learn the basics before you make yourself look like a fool?\n \nThe those who have the \"good\" genes are likely to be selected...ie go on to breed. What book do you read from?\nRight. But that's not what you said, and you still don't understand. I'll explain it again and type real slow this time in hopes that you will grasp the concept. The \"good genes,\" as you so quaintly call them, lend a statistical differential reproductive advantage. That means that they are more likely to reach reproductive age and that they will tend to produce more offspring, and those offspring will be more likely to reach reproductive age, etc., etc.\n \nOr that they are dead, say from a genetic disease.\n \n So you are saying that genetics has nothing to do with genetics?\nwhy don't you address my point?...do you disagree?\nYou made a point? Your quaint view of human breeding habits isn't a very good example of nature in general. As I stated, your \"point\" was, essentially, that genetics has nothing to do with genetics. If that's not what you meant, then you should learn to think before speaking.\n \nHow many genetic diseases do you know of that disallow people to breed? How many of your friends can't breed?\nLet me see - the ones who died before they were able to breed, some of whom died of genetic diseases.\n \nHow often to you poke your nose into monkey genitals in order to know that?\n Even Darwin objected to the use of the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" in referring to his theories. He never used the phrase before the 4th edition of \"Origin\" and then he never used it without also making a reference to natural selection.\nI didn't say darwin used that phrase. Survival of the fittest just insinuates that those who are the fittest will go on to breed while those who aren't won't. arguing with you is like arguing with a post.\nHow is that relevant to evolutionary biology? Your implication is incomplete. Natural selection is not merely a matter of breeding... But I repeat myself, and still you fail to grasp the meaning.\n \nNot really. Even Darwin recognized that it is populations that evolve, not individuals.\nI didn't say otherwise.\nYes. You did. You claimed that the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" had meaning in evolutionary biology. It doesn't.\n \nNatural selection is differential reproductive success. I suspect that you aren't able to understand anything that Dawkins has said.\nWhat did I misunderstand?\nThe concept of the selfish gene.\n \nEven if they work together sometimes, the times that they don't is enough to make your claims nonsense. Apparently you have never watched a pride of lions, or a pack of wolves or coyotes eat. The strongest eat first. When food is scarce, some may not survive.\nThose same lions hunt in packs...and they most all certainly eat.[/quote]That was expressed so clumsily that I am not quite sure what you are saying. In fact, when game is scarce they do not all eat. At least have the balls to check it out. In bad times, the young of the most dominant females are more likely to survive.\n \nThe males will probably get the first pick, but so what...ever notice how hyenas (I think it is) upchuck their food for their offspring?\nSo if there isn't enough to feed all, then some will die. And why change the subject? What if the hyena is starving and doesn't have anything to upchuck? It's like talking to a box of rocks.\n \nWhat about grazing animals or insects or turtles or spiders or gnats or chickens or ladybugs...how do those fit into your silly theory?...you think that one is that much \"fitter\" than the next???? How?\nWhat about them? I guess you've never seen cattle starving during a drought. You've never found dead deer that starved during the winter.\n \nActually, the fiercest competition comes from within the same population. Not all organisms born can possibly survive.\nThat doesn't mean there's a genetic diffference.\nActually, it does. Those with beneficial characteristics will tend to survive and produce more offspring than those who don't. Do you understand what we are talking about?\n \nAbsolutely not. One of the points that have to be drilled into the heads of creationists over and over again is that natural selection is not random. You are either a liar or ignorant.\nselection on the level of the species is claimed to be mostly random by evolutoinists -- look it up.\nOK. Ignorant. Natural selection is not random. That is a pretty basic tenet of evolutionary theory. That you continue to claim otherwise only makes you look like a fool.\n \nSpeciation and extinction is also mostly random. David Raup wrote a book on the randomness of extinction.\nYou're going to have to elaborate on what this has to do with the discussion. Why do you keep changing the subject?\n \nYou are going to lose this debate......selection on the individual level according to evolutionists is nonrandom -- but selection on the species level is random.......\nBefore you can claim a score, you have to actually cross the goal with the ball. You're full of it. Why the straw man? If you want to argue against evolutionary theory, why don't you argue against evolutionary theory instead of making it up?\n \n[snip]meaningless, out of context quote[/snip]\nWe can only wonder what point your were trying to make.\n \nSo don't you think it's pretty stupid how evolutionists go to great lengths to convince people that there are enough variations among individuals that would determine if one is \"fit\" enough to breed....\nSince you don't seem to be able to buy a clue, I'll give you one for free. First, I think that you are pretty stupid. Second, it has nothing to do with \"enough\" variation. It has to do with the statistical advantage that certain genetic variations lend to an organism. There is no such thing as \"enough variation\" and such an idea is moronic.\n \nyet among populations, where there are REAL variations of fitness they call this selection RANDOM???\nNo, they don't. Evolution through natural selection takes place at the population level, and it is not random. Can you say \"environment?\"\n \n They also refer to extinction and speciation as a mostly random events.........XXXXXX!\nWhy do you lump speciation with extinction? Speciation is a non-random response to random changes in the environment. Extinction may be random, i.e., the Alvarez event.\n \nHere's a quote from mayr regarding selection,[snip]out of context quote[/snip]So....do you evolutionists agree with this?\nCertainly not, since that was Mayr's statement of the opposing position. You haven't actually read any of the books that you quote, have you?\n \nLet's take humans. Are only a few people in this generation \"fit\" enough to go on to breed? Is Mayr smoking crack or what?????? This theory is pathetic.\nBut that's not what Mayr said. What you don't seem to understand is that those who are \"fit to breed\" survive to do so. But more importantly for evolution, they produce more offspring that also survive to breed. If you have actually read Mayr, you apparently lack the mental acuity to understand. I suspect that you have read neither Mayr nor Dawkins.\n \n...regarding the randomness of Extinctions...Mayr says on pg. 203\nDuh. Why are you changing the subject? What do extinction events have to do with natural selection? Is your understanding so poor?\n \nMayr pg. 118\n \n \"Herbert Spencer, when swaying that natural selection is nothing but \"the survival of the fittest,\" was indeed quite right. Natural selection is a process of elimination.\"\n \n I'm redeemed again!\nYou're an idiot. Of course it is. Some mechanisms tend to increase genetic variability and others tend to reduce it. What is your excuse for not learning the basics. Mutation, gene flow, and recombination tend to increase variability. Natural selection, sexual selection, and genetic drift tend to decrease it.\n [QUOTE=supersport;234338]Is Evolution a fact????? Well let's watch these two dudes battle it out. First of up is Ernst Mayr from What Evolution Is:[snip]out of context quotes[/snip] Wouldn't it be nice if you used out of context quotes that were discussing the same point? Did you actually understand either?\n \nOk......does anyone now see why evolutionists are impossible to believe?\nNo. I have more problems with 6000 year old earth, 6 day creation that doesn't agree with the story of Eden, and that big FLUD, for which there is no evidence.\n \nThey trip over themselves at every turn. They don't know which end is up or which end is down. They don't know if evolution happens rapidly, slowly, randomly, with direction, with or without selection, from which sweaty monkey we evolved...etc etc etc.\nUp or down are irrelevant. That would be a matter of physics. But we know that evolution happens rapidly, slowly, sometimes randomly but mostly not, without direction, and mostly by selection. I'll have to take your word about sweaty monkeys since you stated that you spend considerable time with your nose poked into their genitals. By the way, we didn't evolve from any monkey.\n \nHeck, they don't even know if genetic accomodation is officially part of their religion.\nWhat is genetic accommodation? What religion are you talking about?\n \nAsk them -- no one will tell you. Neither will they tell you if evolution happens phyletically or punctually...(is that a word?) How hard is that to answer?\nWTF are you babbling about? Does that actually have meaning in any language?\n \nAll they know is that God didn't create us. That's about all they can agree on.\nYet again you change the topic. Who, exactly, knows that your god didn't create us? Who agrees with that? Can you offer any evidence that your god exists?",

[Therefore it cannot be the Darwinian process of favourable allele(s)in a given environment replacing unfavourable allele(s), i.e. for small beak size, in a population. That, by definition requires the finches bearing the unfavourable allele(s) to die without offspring and then the finches bearing the favourable allele(s), i.e. for large beak size to breed up.\n \n Oxford evolutionary biologist Mark Ridley confirmed that for \"the theory of evolution by natural selection ... A mutant that produces on average 1 per cent more offspring than its alternative allele ... would take 4,266 generations to increase in frequency from 0.1 per cent to 99.9 per cent of the population\":\n \n Darwin himself emphasised that \"natural selection is a slow process\":Therefore, I assume that this change is not even Darwinian natural selection of random micromuations, but is in fact an example of \"phenotypic plasticity\", i.e. \"The ability of an organism with a given genotype to change its phenotype in response to changes in the environment\":\n \n Checkmate",

   "As to the distinction between selection being non-random and extinction being random, supersport - I think you're being a little hasty in describing that as a contradiction. \n \n I don't think so.\n \n \n If a genetically varied population survives a change in the environment, those members genetically better equipped to handle that change (and their descendants) are likely to form a greater proportion of the surviving population - would you agree? \n \n No...what makes you so sure that a population of animals is so genetically different that some would survive a change in the environment and some would not?

   "No...what makes you so sure that a population of animals is so genetically different that some would survive a change in the environment and some would not? Look at animals of any given population...they're all the same!\n\n \n That's a very risky claim to make. You're suggesting that no lion is bigger or stronger or more agile or has greater endurance than any other? Or are you saying they're all genetically identical - I can assure you such is not the case. Or that genetic differences are not linked to survival traits? Superficial visual similarities are not the whole story.\n \n \nThe fitness level between one and the next could not possibly be enough to distinguish who could breed and who couldn't.\n\n \n When times are easy, you're correct - that's precisely how genetic diversity can arise. If animals always had to be so fine-tuned to their environment that even a tiny deviation would spell death-before-reproduction, evolution as we know it could not occur. When resources are plentiful, however, genetic variations are free from selective pressure and can drift and accumulate, subject to the statistical influence of the scope of interbreeding within the population.\n \n But what happens to times of plenty? They come to an end - often thanks to nothing more than the over-abundance of the consumers of those resources. In these harsher times, better-adapted individuals are statistically more likely to breed successfully. It's not an all-or-nothing matter. You're quite wrong to demand such gross, visible changes from mutation that the resulting creatures be incapable of reproduction. Even a slight statistical advantage is enough given sufficient generations.\n \nAnd we don't see mass deaths of populations of animals upon an environmental change....the world just does not witness death on a huge scale like that.\n\n You really think so? The permian extinction killed 95% of marine life and 70% of all land life - if not directly then in a chain-reaction of extinctions - and that's just one of many. \n \n \nhow is it RANDOM if some species can survive a harsh winter while some cannot? how is it random if small, aggressive fire ants from Mexico migrate north to Texas and wipe out the existing populations of larger, less aggressive red ants? That makes no sense.\n\n \n That's like saying lotteries are not random because 'who gets the money' once the winning number is drawn is not random.\n \n The harsh winter being harsh enough to cause extinction is the random part. One species might become extinct because of a harsh winter - or another might instead have become extinct through lack of food or over-predation after an unusually mild winter - such as seems likely in the case of polar bears facing ever-shorter periods of frozen polar ice for them to hunt seals upon. Which species becomes extinct and why follows logically from what the change is to the environment, but which change occurs to the environment is, from the perspective of the species involved, random.\n \n \nI'm glad, at least, that you admit that species selection must be random though...not many evolutionists do....yet it is a requirement.\n\n \n I'm not sure I'm qualified enough to admit anything; I'm merely following what I see as logical conjecture and remain willing to be persuaded otherwise by anyone better-informed.\n \n \nWell actually I think common sense says that however animals respond and/or evolve today is exactly how they did in the past. To say otherwise is some pretty wild speculation.\n\n \n I'd term it conjecture, rather than speculation, to surmise that if a gene is more successful in one environment and a mutant alelle of that gene more successful in a different environment, and a broad selection of populations are repeatedly subjected to both environments over millions of years, the populations left at the end will most likely exhibit the ability to express both alelles.\n \n Furthermore (and here I am speculating - I would love to know if I'm anywhere near the mark), we know that alelles can be repressed or expressed based on factors like temperature and chemical presence or absence during gestation. Aren't the most successful populations, at the end of the day, statistically likely to be composed of individuals where that conditional repression or expression of alelles - itself genetically determined - happens to be advantageous, rather than detrimental?\n \n This is what I mean by the dominant mechanism of evolution changing over time - don't forget that word 'dominant'. I'm not saying other mechanisms cease to operate, just that - when dealing with common environmental changes which have occurred millions of times over - their effects might be drowned out by those of (slowly) evolved 'fast response' mechanisms.\n \n Take the frog example again: what might appear to be a mechanism designed to allow frogs to gestate at a wide range of temperatures - varying on a daily basis! - could have evolved slowly in tandem with frog ancestors migrating to less and less predictable environments. What's the difference between that and any other kind of 'plastic' genome having evolved in response to similar environmental variability, just on a different timescale?\n \n I might be hugely wide of the mark; I would welcome the input of more knowledgable voices here.",
