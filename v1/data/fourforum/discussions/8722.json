   "France Declines to Contribute Major Force for U.N. Mission\n \n By Colum Lynch\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Friday, August 18, 2006; Page A16\n \n UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 17 -- France on Thursday rebuffed pleas by U.N. officials to make a major contribution to a peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, setting back efforts to deploy an international military force to help police a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, according to U.N. and French officials.\n \n French President Jacques Chirac said Thursday that France would contribute only 200 additional troops to the U.N. operation in southern Lebanon, which the Security Council wants to expand from 2,000 troops to 15,000. Chirac said that a force of about 1,700 French troops and crew members on warships off the coast would provide logistical support.\n \n Senior U.N. peacekeeping officials said they had hoped France would send thousands of troops, forming the backbone of a large and robust mission that would spur other countries to join. Under a Security Council resolution adopted last week, the U.N. force is to help 15,000 Lebanese soldiers take control of southern Lebanon as Israeli soldiers withdraw.\n \n The French decision on troop levels, reported Thursday in the Paris daily Le Monde, sent U.N. officials scrambling during a meeting here to find countries willing to fill the void.\n \n At the meeting, several governments, including Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh, committed to send a total of nearly 4,000 troops, while Britain, Denmark and Germany agreed to send warships to patrol Lebanon's Mediterranean coast for arms smuggling. The United States pledged to provide logistical support, but not ground troops.\n \n Germany's U.N. ambassador, Thomas Matussek, said that pending parliamentary approval, his government would also provide customs officers and specialized police to help Lebanon monitor its border with Syria, a key transit point for Hezbollah's arms supplies.\n \n But there were no firm commitments to contribute personnel for a crucial, well-equipped spearhead force of 3,500 troops that the United Nations is trying to get into southern Lebanon within the next 10 days, according to India's U.N. ambassador, Nirupam Sen. The United Nations had hoped that the mission would be made up largely of forces from advanced military powers, including France, Italy, Spain and Turkey, whose troops and firepower could deter challenges.\n \n U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan called Chirac on Thursday to plead with him to reconsider. The French president's office released a statement later indicating he had not yielded.\n \n The statement confirmed that France would send a company of 200 military engineers to Lebanon. They would join more than 200 French peacekeepers already serving in the relatively small U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL. Chirac also told Annan that \"France was prepared to assume command\" of the bolstered U.N. force, according to the statement.\n \n Addressing potential troop contributors, the U.N. deputy secretary general, Mark Malloch Brown, said no U.N. task in Lebanon was \"more urgent, nor more fundamental to preserving peace\" than sending a \"strong, robust force\" to help the Lebanese army assert its authority over south Lebanon for the first time in more than 25 years. \"Every moment we delay is a moment of risk that the fighting could re-erupt,\" he said.\n \n After the meeting, Malloch Brown said that although he had feared that France's announcement would \"cast a shadow\" over U.N. recruiting efforts for the mission, it had not \"deterred others from coming forward with offers.\" Still, he declined to discuss whether there were commitments for the first phase of the U.N. deployment.\n \n Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dan Gillerman, said he hoped that other countries would fill the void. \"There were a lot of expectations the French would actually lead this thing, and a lot of countries are waiting to see what France does,\" Gillerman said. \"I'm not sure France is the key. We know there are quite a few other countries who want to take part.\"\n \n Gillerman said that the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon was \"moving along\" but that a final decision to return all the troops to Israel would \"obviously depend very much on the international force being deployed.\"\n \n Diplomats said France had done little before Thursday to dampen expectations that it would play a far more ambitious peacekeeping role.\n \n U.S. officials said they had been caught off guard by the French decision but still harbored hopes that France would reconsider and provide more troops. \"It took us a little by surprise,\" said one Bush administration official, who declined to speak publicly because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. \"We are seeking an explanation. We assume there is more to the story.\"\n \n The decision was prompted in part by the French military's anxiety over serving under U.N. command, diplomats said. French officials cited the loss of 84 French troops in the U.N. mission in the early 1990s in Bosnia, and the seizure of French peacekeepers as hostages. French officials had also expressed concern that Hezbollah fighters were not prepared to disarm and might turn their guns on peacekeeping troops, according to U.N. diplomats. In 1983, Islamic militants killed 58 French paratroops in a suicide bomb attack in Beirut.\n \n Staff writer Glenn Kessler in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n \n What a shocker. I especially like the part about France \"forming the backbone\" of the peacekeeping force. Might be possible, if they were not spineless.",

We just approved it, ran interference at the UN, and made emergency shipments of bombs, including bunker busters (which did not work).\n \n You can tell yourself all you want that we were a third party in this. At the end of the day, the US is still going to get attacked in the name of dead lebanese, because frankly to try to pretend like we were a third party in this is delusional, and most of the world is not quite THAT delusional.\n \n \nSecond, meeting resistance isn't \"blunder\".

Anti-war people have gotten spoiled on the easy small wars after Vietnam such as Libya, Nicaragua, and the first Gulf War, so now when realistic war comes along, it's called things like \"blunder.\" Israel drove back Hezbollah. They met their objective.\n\n \n Hezbollah was launching rockets into israel right up to the moment the ceasefire went into effect. Their popularity has surged enormously with the arab population of the ME, and Israel did not even manage to destroy the majority of their bunkers (the bunker busters we provided did not have the penetration capability needed). \n \n On the other hand, Hezbollah has garnered enough international sympathy due to Israels heavy handed (and illegal) tactics that Iran and Syria have both been caught resupplying them, and nobody cared. Israel has asked for an international force to patrol the syrian border as well to keep out resupply, and nobody is even willing to consider it, despite the fact that the lebanese have already said they are not oging ot disarm hezbollah.\n \n So, how exactly have they driven back hezbollah? Israel has not managed to accomplish even a single one of their goals. Even the israeli people recognize that they spent a fortune, killed a lot of people, and accomplished not a damn thing. It was so bad that the Israeli PM got up and took responsibility for the failure.\n \n \n \nFinally, concerning your comments about the US \"picking up the tab for Israeli military expenditure\", it needs to be noted that 70% of the funds the US provides for the Israeli military gets pumped back into the US economy because they purchase from US companies (e.g. Lockheed, Raytheon, and Boeing).\n\n \n 3 problems with this. First, our arms arrangements with israel are not that simple. They purchase weapons from us, and in return we are contractually bound to purchase weapons from them (american designed weapons built under license in israel). We are required to pay cash for the weapons we get from them. They pay in vouchers to us that thoeretically are essentially bonds that they repay. They have NEVER paid for a single one of the bonds.\n \n So essentially we get screwed 3 times. First, we give israel money to buy weapons. Then we are forced to buy weapons from israel, then they buy more weapons with vouchers that they never repay. \n \n The fact that most of that money ends up being spent here is at best meaningless and at worst bad for us. Military equipment in general amounts to non value added goods. They add no real value to your economy, so the money created in the course of their production is inflationary in nature. When you are considering the situation with the US and israel, you also have to consider the fact that we are running a deficit, so debt service costs have to be added as well.\n \n Overall, it ends up being a hugely expensive charlie foxtrot.",

There is a vocal minoirty that is hell bent on theri absolute annihilation, most of whom tend to be victims of israeli agression (folks who have lost their families, etc...) but none of tht is particularly serious. Even Hamas, who has talked for years about wiping Israel off the map is negotiating. \n \n \nI can agree that we should help Palestine get on their feet as long as it's democracy and Hamas stays out of the way.\n\n \n So as long as it is a democracy where we choose the players? BS. First, Hamas was elected rpiarily as a direct response to a palestenain government that refused to stand up for the people and just let israel walk all over them. Israel, and the US, are just goign to havce to accept the fact that Hamas is there to stay nad will likely end up running palestine. When the British and the IRA sat down to talk, nothign got accomplished until the British accepted that the IRA was going political, and they would have to deal with them in the political arena.\n \n \n \nI never said Israel shouldn't have to obey the law. But sovereign nations ought to have the prerogative to ignore intl law in defense, if their very existence is threatened.\n\n \n This is true. Israel has not gone to war to defend itself for 30 years, so this is not really an issue. Now, Israel is pretty mch going to have to accept that attacks by individuals are going to be part of life for the next several years. That is just what happens when you do monsterous things. There is not much that they or anybody else can do about that. You simply cannot behave the way israel has and then expect everybody to forget about it.\n \n The problem is that israel wants a free pass. They want somebody else to handle the terrorism problem that they created. They want the other side to simply forget abotu the years of oppression, hundreds of thousands dead, and Israels blatant disregard for international law. That is simply not going to happen. The BEST they can hope for is a palestenian state that does not actively encourge, and tries to discourage attacks. To hold the palestenian state as a whole responsible for individual attacks would be every bit as redculous as holding belgium responsible for 9/11 because atta was there before he came here. After all, he planned his attacks from Belgium. He got supplies form Belgium. His network operated in Belgium. Therefore the government of belgium MUST HAVE been comlicit in the attacks, and we should have IMMEDIATLY attacked, destroyed, and occupied Belgium.\n \n Of course any thinking person is going to find that line of thought ludicrous, and rightly so. That is more or less israels official foreign policy.",

If they want to play the coward card in front of the international community, I feel no shame in pointing it out.\n\n \n France does nto want to end up in a situation where they simply are observing a war on all sides with them stuck in the middle and unable to do anything. France wants to actually be peaceKEEPERS instead of peaceOBSERVERS. They want a strengthened mandate that allows them to act as opposed to observe. \n \n This makes sense. Rather than being able to stand by and take notes if hizbollah launches rockets into israel, france wants the peacekeepers to have the authority to actually STOP THEM or, barring that, that be able to bomb the hell out of the launcher and the people operating it when it is over. \n \n It is interestinf that American media picked up so heavily on that snippet about hizbollah. I watched that speech on telvision,and there was about 3 minutes about concern about hizbollah not following the ceasefire, and about 30 minutes about concern of israel not following the cease fire. The French recognize that the Isralis have a long history of agreeing to cease fires, or signing peace treaties, and then attacking once their enemy has backed down. That seems to be a central theme in their defense policy. \n \n What france wants is a force with teeth. For example, one of their proposals is for the US and russians to both supply automated air defense systems (if not the men to operate them) so that any Israeli military craft that cross the border are automatically shot down since under the terms of the ceasefire, Israeli craft are not to be on the lebanese side of the border.\n \n The french are no frinds of israel, and they are not particularly interested in puttting a force in place to ensure that israel can strike with impunity inside labnon, which is what israel and our own government seems to have in mind. Israle has been runnign cross border raids and conducting kidnappings of lebanese citizens since they first withdrew, and the UN force has had to simply stand by and whatch them do it.

Most of saddams bunkers in Iraq, which the news media described as being \"deep underground\" in reality only had a meter or less of actual dirt over them. \n \n They did manage to get one of our conventional bunker busters to penetrate 100ft, which is considered its rangeunder ideal conditions. Unfortunatly, the ideal conditions were created with bulldozers, it is not something you find in nature. Typically, useful depth is only about 30 ft. That is about as far as you can count on one of those bunker buster penetrating.\n \n Iran and Hezbollah both have bunkers that are over 300 meters underground.

Then this morning I saw this:\n \n http://intelligence.house.gov/Media/PDFS/IranReport082206v2.pdf\n \n It is a report from the house subcommittee on intel policy, and it is a masterful bit of spin. The entire basis of the report is that they do not feel that we have enough intel on Irans weapons or nuclear program. What is truly masterful is that after they admit that they do not have XXXX when it comes to information about Iran, they the lay out an argument Iran is behind every anti american plot on the planet, supporting all manner of terrorists and evildoers, and is goign to nuke us all off the planet by months end.

   "Why don't you speak for yourself and refrain from generalizing based on my desire to kill terrorists? You have no real grasp of what all of my doctrines are. I have no idea of what you consider neocon doctrines.\n \n You and some of your running mates have a tendency to paint others as goose-stepping nazis, neocons or whatever you want to call them and I'm suspecting your reasoning is much the same as that which drives you to strawman arguments a lot. You put up some easily hated discriptor of your opponent and smugly claim not to be such. Everybody I know hates nazis. You and your ilk tend to use that quite a lot.\n \n When you haven't the wherewithall to refute common sense and good logic, you simply refer to the opponent as a XXXXX, a nazi, a neocon, a sociopath or some other derogatory tag. This labeling has little truth in it (if any) and does nothing to promote a mature discussion.\n \n I don't think you'll find where I've not expressed compassion for innocent people. Killing them with intent to do so is wrong. (That's what terrorists do.) Killing them with intent to kill a known terrorist is a necessary evil. (That's what we do.) Placing innocents in the line of fire for protection is wrong. (That's what they do.) Minimizing deaths of innocents is not wrong. (That's what we do.)\n\n \n Jim, after reading the definition I posted, please tell me how it differs from your geopolitical stance. That definition, or label, fits your posted opinions on US actions against Vietnam, Iraq, Lebanon and any other country not adhering to US values or following US policy. \n \n As to the killing of innocents, you condemn those you consider enemies for killing non-combatants while condoning US/Israeli actions accomplishing the same thing. Intent is equally distributed on both sides, your only rationalization being killing methodology used by the US/Israel is more humane because it's accomplished by pushing a button.

Explosives, however delivered, employ the same destructive actions...they explode! The difference in intent is that ours are aimed at specific enemy targets.\n \n Regarding our bombing of a restuarant in an attempt to kill Saddam, I don't know that I have expressed glee in that action. Even had it killed Saddam, I don't know that I would have been happy with it. That is quite a bit different from bombing a building known to house a terrorist training facility or known to contain a multitude of terrorists planning an attack.\n \n I would not have \"pushed the button\" for the restuarant attack.\n \n Additionally, I seem to recall an instance wherein Slick Willy Clinton had an opportunity to blow Osama out of the sand and had reliable intelligence that Osama was indeed present at the targeted area. He refrained from doing so because there was another important person there that we would have a hard time explaining why we killed him too. I applauded his decision not to \"push the button\" on that one even though it did allow that sorry POS to live long enough to see the WTC fall to the ground in a heap of rubble. I don't remember who the other party was and the whole thing is a vague memory, but I do remember, after hearing the whole situation recanted, that I agreed with his decision not to strike.\n \n Regarding daewoo's question about cluster-bombing southern Lebanon, I haven't heard of any such instances where the general public was not warned prior to the bombing. Carpet bombing of Lebanon (by the Israelis) was likely concentrated in areas known to be heavily infested with Hezbollah rats. What I've heard is that civilians were urged to leave the area. Whether they heeded the warnings or were permitted to leave is unknown by me. I do know that Hezbollah and all the other chickens of the desert tend to hide behind women and children thus raising our innocent/intended death ratio.\n \n You and daewoo both seem to accept the terrorist's logic that since we are ALL their enemy, they are justified in attacking the WTC and setting off their indiscriminate bombs elsewhere. Most of us realize that this is their way of thinking, but we do not agree with it. You seem to sympathize with the wrong people simply because of their definition of legitimate target.",

How would you like it if the Chinese government helped install a tyrannical dictatorship in the US, then provided them with enough weapons and intelligence capabilities to ensure that the people could never slip out form under that tyrannical government? I would just about bet that you would not be real big on that experiment. THE SAUDS ARE NOT REAL BIG ON IT EITHER. The difference is that in their case WE ACTUALLY DID IT while in the above scenario, it is just a hypothetical. \n \n The simple fact of the matter is that there is simply not a whole lot good to say about the US in the current conflict. We are fighting for our perceived right to support, if not actively assist in, the murder and oppression of millions without fear of retribution. It is pretty hard to find a lot of positive in there.\n \n \nYou're a smart fellow, and you should have the sense to know that, yes, when Saddam dines at a public restaurant, KNOWING full well the US military is targeting him, he's using people as human shields.

We were apparently \"Hiding\" our military and intelligence infrastructure among the civilain population. Also by that logic, anybody with a beef against the US would have been entirely justified in bombing hte XXXX out of the wedding that Bush attended last week, since he was apparently \"hiding\" among the civilian population. Also by your logic, any establishment, and the area around those establishments, where any member of the US military is located at the time is, in fact, a legitimate target. AND we can not leave out reservist. These guys are the ultimate in \"hiding among the population\". They are like sleeper agents. They live perfectly normal lives except for occasional training sessions, and then are ready to spring forth at a moments notice and carry out attacks. \n \n Face it, your argument here is absolutly idiotic. By your logic, in order to preserve anythign resembling the safety of your population, all your political and military leaders would have to live on individual estates consisting of several square miles and would never be able to go out or mingle with the general public.

Terrorists KNOW we are attacking them, and they hide among civilians. You are very naive to not realize that.\n\n \n So THEN the WTC was not a legitimate target, but NOW it is. Now you have me confused. The first 2 days of the Iraq war we ran a wildly unsucessful \"decapitation\" campaign where we tried to get the Iraq leadership by bombing office buildings, residential areas, etc... Were those legitimate targets or not? \n \n I ask becuase while they expected an attack, we had not actually started the war. Then again, if those WERE legitimate attacks, then it would stand to reason that the WTC attacks were legitimate as well, since they had been threatening US with attacks for years.\n \n Then again, it is not exactly the same, since they had attacked us before (USS cole, etc...) and declared open warfare against the US. The only people who were shocked at the WTC attacks were the American people, the rest fo the world and our own government had been expecting attacks on US soil for years. \n \n \nThe real problem here is that you insist on the idiotic idea that somehow the US and terrorists are both cut from the same cloth, and that they are equal in ethics somehow. you don't realize that there is a difference between terrorists and the US military. and that there is a difference between democracy and Islamic fascism, and even when the difference is clear you go to great pains to try to portray the situation otherwise with no evidence. You never even talk about anything GOOD with the US, and go to pains to talk about anything bad. Anything stated that IS good, you try to spin it into somthing bad. You judge the US with no regard for why it got the point where it's had to happen this way. Quite frankly, the way you post, you might as well be working for the propaganda dept of Iran or Bin Laden. I'm serious; that's not an attempt to insult you. And because you are close-minded about this and will only dogmatically and irrationally view the US in an evil light, there's no point in continuing with you. Your dogmatic approach is too much like the right-wingers.\n\n \n OK, so explain it to me. WHY is it good for the US to support the oppression and deaths of millions of Arabs? What BS justifiaction beyond \"we wanted their oil\" can there really be for that? We are certainly not cut from the same cloth. The US is fighting to be able to murder and opress people, either directly or indirectly, while the terrorists are fighting to make us stop. \n \n There certainly is a difference between the terrorists and the US military. Besides the major difference I listed above (that we are fighting ont eh side of tyranny and oppression), the terrorists do not have billions of dollars to spend on high tech gee wiz gadgets. They also lack fighter jets, big bombs, armour, and all manner of other cool stuff. When they kill people, they have to be up close and personal. When we kill people, we can do it from hundreds of miles away, or miles in the air. \n \n Again, why don't you list all the good things when it comes to US foreign policy in the ME? \n \n You keep asking for evidence. What evidence are you looking for? Are you asking for evidence that the US has traditionally supported tyrant in the ME? Do you need evidence that supproting these tyrants has led tot he deaths of huge numbers of people? What exactly are you loking for here? I have been speaking in fairly general terms, basing my discussion on the assumption that others posess at least a minimal amount of knowledge when it comes to the history of that region and our involvement there. \n \n There is certainly a difference between democracy and islamic fascism. Democracy is a real system, while \"islamic fascism\" is a moronic phrase that comes very close to being an oxymoron. It is completely nonsensical. Maybe you could rephrase that so that it actually makes sense. \n \n Then you could explain how you could possibly argue that we are the champions of democracy in this when we are the primary supporters of, and frankly the reson for the survival of, the government of Saudi Arabia, the most totalitarian government on the planet.",

   "You and daewoo both seem to accept the terrorist's logic that since we are ALL their enemy, they are justified in attacking the WTC and setting off their indiscriminate bombs elsewhere. Most of us realize that this is their way of thinking, but we do not agree with it. You seem to sympathize with the wrong people simply because of their definition of legitimate target.\n\n \n Explain why we are not. This is a democratic country, Jim. In any democracy the people hold ultimate power and therefore ultimate responsibility. We are being attacekd because or foreign policy in the ME has sucked for at least 50 years. We elected the folks who have implemented that policy, and keep re electing peopel who perpetuate it. The only way for us to STOP that policy is to elect people who will STOP it. \n \n The PEOPLE in this country are ultimatly responsible for those decisions, and if you want them changed, you have to motivate the people to change them. Unfortunatly the people have become so disconnected from the political machinery in this country that it takes a LOT to motivate them (for example, 80% of americans support a balanced budget amendment, and we have yet to see one because while they support it, they are not motivated enough to act). \n \n To the political leadership of this country, the people and the soldiers are jsut cannon fodder. In order for the terrorists to accomplish their goals, they have only 2 options. Convince the people or destroy the country. The people of the US have shown themselves to have the morals of an SS torture officer when it comes to foreign policy.

All one has to do is look at our current financial situation including debt load and it becomes pretty obvious that we are up for some hard times here in the next few years....complete economic collapse is on the table and not at all an unreasonable prediction.... the idea of a \"soft landing\" has become a joke, and a large part of that is the multi trillion dollar price tag of these attacks and our associated follow up.",

   "No, I don't think the US has been actively targeting civilians. I think we are completely and totally indifferent to civilians. I have yet to see anything suggesting that we ever even CONSIDER civilians.\nFor purposes of your argument, I would go blind, too. \n \n\n This is what you seem to miss. \"People like Saddam and terrorists\" are people just like US. Just like you, just like me. ...\nExcept that people like me don't advocate strapping bombs to some dupe who's willing to blow himself up for \"Allah\" and sending him to a shopping mall where other peoples, possibly from all nations and all ethnic groups...possibly some friends may be shopping for their daily enjoyment of life.\n \n You on the other hand seem to advocate just that.\n \n \nHow would you like it if the Chinese government helped install a tyrannical dictatorship in the US, then provided them with enough weapons and intelligence capabilities to ensure that the people could never slip out form under that tyrannical government? I would just about bet that you would not be real big on that experiment. THE SAUDS ARE NOT REAL BIG ON IT EITHER. The difference is that in their case WE ACTUALLY DID IT while in the above scenario, it is just a hypothetical.\nCountries have been doing similarly for centuries. France, Great Britain, China, Spain...you name it in the list of powerful countries throughout history have done nearly exactly as you say.\n \n \n\n The simple fact of the matter is that there is simply not a whole lot good to say about the US in the current conflict. We are fighting for our perceived right to support, if not actively assist in, the murder and oppression of millions without fear of retribution. It is pretty hard to find a lot of positive in there.\nThere's likely just as much good happening as bad. We just won't hear about the good because the hate-mongers and camera whores control what we see and hear about every story that unfolds. And you personally won't listen when you do hear it.\n \n \n \n\n Again, by that logic, the WTC was a perfectly acceptable target because there were CIA offices there. We were apparently \"Hiding\" our military and intelligence infrastructure among the civilain population. Also by that logic, anybody with a beef against the US would have been entirely justified in bombing hte XXXX out of the wedding that Bush attended last week, since he was apparently \"hiding\" among the civilian population. Also by your logic, any establishment, and the area around those establishments, where any member of the US military is located at the time is, in fact, a legitimate target. AND we can not leave out reservist. These guys are the ultimate in \"hiding among the population\". They are like sleeper agents. They live perfectly normal lives except for occasional training sessions, and then are ready to spring forth at a moments notice and carry out attacks. \n \n Face it, your argument here is absolutly idiotic. By your logic, in order to preserve anythign resembling the safety of your population, all your political and military leaders would have to live on individual estates consisting of several square miles and would never be able to go out or mingle with the general public. Any time one appeared in public for any reason, whetehr it was to buy toilet paper or to give a speech to thousadnds, everybody around them woudl be legitimate targets.\n...and by your logic any target in the world is legitimate for us to blow up because there may be a terrorist hiding in it. You said the WTC was a legitimate target. You seem to justify what the terrorists are doing and the way they operate. You seem to have sympathy for their cause. That's one difference between you and decent people.\n \n \n \n\n No, I don't make a lot of unfounded statements. \nYour nose is growing!!!!!\n \n \nJim looks like a XXXXX and keeps getting slapped down when he argues that.

Unfortunatly the people have become so disconnected from the political machinery in this country that it takes a LOT to motivate them (for example, 80% of americans support a balanced budget amendment, and we have yet to see one because while they support it, they are not motivated enough to act). \nI do not disagree with this.

It was literally just TODAY that I saw Rumsfeld pitching this in a speach and you have already picked it up!!! Does the bush administration have a propoganda feed straight into your brain??\n \n Personally, I trust the media very little. However, by piecing together facts thrown out by both sides of the issue, plus application of a little logic, you can generally get to the core of the matter. Fro example, we know for a FACT that the ruling party in IRaq is the Dawa party. We know for a FACT that they are based in and funded by Iran. From this, the only logical conclusion is that we expended a couple trillion dollars, a couple thousand american lives, and killed a LOT of Iraqi civilains with the end result being IRaq being run by Iran (whom ironically enough has been picked for our next target). \n \n What are these good things being done over there that we need to be aware of? A lot of the good stuff that gets flaunted does not really get you any brownie points. For example, I heard the other day that we finally got the Baghdad hospital fully repaired. That is nice and all, but to break an arm patting ourselves on the back for that would be a little ironic, since we had to repair it because we bombed it. \n \n What Rumsfeld, and you, are pushing here is the \"shoot the messenger\" strategy perfected by Hitler in the early years of his rule. I am sure that it was used at other times in history, but Hitler was the first to really use it to influence the direction of an entire nation. Hitler had some real PR problems early on, largely due to the fairly brutal tactics of his party. He dealt with this by claiming a media conspiracy (in fact a conspiracy by jewish newspaper owners) to discredit him and his party. He used pretty much the same rhetoric as Rumsfeld in his speach and the same that you are trying to push here which boils down to \"They dig for dirt but refuse to report the wonderful things I have done for this country. If you would but ask <insert select group of people< they could tell you what a wonderful person I really am\".\n \n It was BS then and it was BS now. While I certainly do not believe the media is impartial, you are going to have a VERY difficult time convincing me that that media outlets owned by guys like Rupert Murdoch are pushing a heavily anti bush agenda. It is not all a conspiracy by the jewish newspaper owners, Jyoshu. The news that we fixed a very small percentage of the stuff that we blew up to begin with is not anything to get excited about.

Does the bush administration have a propoganda feed straight into your brain??\n\n \n I didn't even know Rumsfeld said anything about it. if he did, he's correct, it is unbalanced. A lot of people I know feel that way.\n \n \nPersonally, I trust the media very little.\n\n \n Unless it happens to fit with what you want to hear about the US, on any given day, I'm sure.\n \n \nWhat are these good things being done over there that we need to be aware of? A lot of the good stuff that gets flaunted does not really get you any brownie points. For example, I heard the other day that we finally got the Baghdad hospital fully repaired. That is nice and all, but to break an arm patting ourselves on the back for that would be a little ironic, since we had to repair it because we bombed it. \n\n \n Would it really matter if I told you what I've heard? Would it really make a difference to you? I don't think it would because you've made up your mind to think a certain way beforehand. Like so many Americans, you apparently refuse to educate yourself instead opting to let corporate media fill your eyes and ear with what they want and you trust them. You say you don't, but your posts and views tell a diff. story.\n \n \nWhat Rumsfeld, and you, are pushing here is the \"shoot the messenger\" strategy perfected by Hitler in the early years of his rule. \n\n \n What utter hogwash. Expecting balanced reporting isn't shooting any messenger. It's expecting balanced reporting. No one's saying we should do away with the media. Put away the DNC talking points propaganda for once. And the Hitler card too while your at it.",

I don't watch much TV, when I do, it is generally the news...usually BBC, MSNBC, or AlJazeera (for local perspective when it comes to the ME). Beyond that, I like the internet for my news (and entertainment). I like the internet because it gives you access to news sources from all over the world. I learned a long time ago that more information = better decisions.\n \n So, lay out your case here. In order to claim that the media is only reporting the bad news and unfairly ignoring the good news you really kind of need to give some example of good news that is being ignored. If it makes you feel any better, even Rumsfeld had trouble comign up with anything. The best he could do was too whine about the fact that the media reported more stories on prisoner abuse than on the congressional medal of honor being awarded posthumously to that guy. \n \n I can actually see both sides of that one. If what you are hoping for is a WWII like sweep of patriotism that converts the citizens of your country inot unthinking, obediant, flag waving zombies, then it would be rough to see something with as high a propoganda value as a congressional medal of honor go virtually un noticed. On the other side of that, typically when you award medals to dead guys, the public isn't real interested.

Hostile to the war and to the administration conducting it, the nation's leading news outlets harp on the negative and pessimistic, consistently underplaying all that is going right in Iraq. Their fixation on the number of troops who have died outweighs their interest in the cause for which those fallen heroes fought -- a cause that advanced with the ratification of the new constitution.\n Poll after poll confirms the public's low level of confidence in mainstream media news. Gallup recently measured that confidence at 28 percent, an all-time low. Why such mistrust? The media's slanted coverage of Iraq provides a pretty good clue.\n \n \n \n No doubt, you'll find fault with the sources and discredit the good news based on the sources.

I think I've already expressed my desire to make all explosives illegal except in declared wars between nations. \n\n \n And yet you have not shown that their target selection differs significantly from ours. Neither side seems to have any problem with blowing up civilians in order to reach their goals. The only difference is that on their side, it is necessary while on our side it it is not. They target our \"civilians\" because it is our \"civilians\" that they have a beef with. We target their civilains becuase it is easier and costs less than sticking exclusively to military targets. \n \n So, it would appear that in the gospel according to Jim, if you attack and kill civilains because it is convenient and cheap, that is OK, if you attack them because they are directly responsible for the circumstances leading to your grievance, and the only people with the power to address that grievance, then that is bad. does that pretty much sum it up?\n \n \nJust about everytime you try to rephrase my argument, you screw it up...on purpose, of course. \n\n \n I don't screw it up.

Thus far pretty much everybody seems to agree that tax cuts CAN help the economy, or they CAN hurt the economy, or they CAN have no effect. The current consesus seems to be that the current round of cuts is a bad thing. Now get over there and dazzle us with your wisdom and knowledge. \n \n \n...and you seem to have skipped over the question of legitimate targets.

So I tend to believe Daewoo when he says he doesn't listen to the media too much and rather takes bits and pieces and forms an opinion. This doesn't make him right but atleast he put some thought into it which is more than most. Personally, I have a hard time forming an opinion on Iraq because it is so messed up other there (even without us) that too complicated to mess with. I am leaning towards the idea of just finding a way to not use their oil and then let them suffer the consequences of their own actions since it seems they wish to live in the stone ages. Any country that actually wishes to attempt to be civil we should probably help and support over there. This includes Israel probably but we should focus on forcing them to create an economy rather than being mad at everyone. \n \n As for the media...of couse they only report the negative of Iraq.

   "Believe it or not, Daewoo tends to be more level-headed than many on this forum. This doesn't mean I agree with him here or most of the time (as i don't haha) but his arguments do tend to be logically flowing with the occasional stuck up non-supported post (no offensive Daewoo...we all have our \"thing\" :p).  So I tend to believe Daewoo when he says he doesn't listen to the media too much and rather takes bits and pieces and forms an opinion. This doesn't make him right but atleast he put some thought into it which is more than most. Personally, I have a hard time forming an opinion on Iraq because it is so messed up other there (even without us) that too complicated to mess with. I am leaning towards the idea of just finding a way to not use their oil and then let them suffer the consequences of their own actions since it seems they wish to live in the stone ages. Any country that actually wishes to attempt to be civil we should probably help and support over there. This includes Israel probably but we should focus on forcing them to create an economy rather than being mad at everyone. \n\n \n Everybody deserves a good rant occasionally emoticon_smile \n \n \nAs for the media...of couse they only report the negative of Iraq. This is just the way it is now and to think otherwise is just foolish. There is no story in something good though. \"Man in Iraq goes to work today..everything is fine\"...just doesn't seem like anyone would watch that. You can't do the opposite now either...\"US rips up the Iraq military with their brave heros\"...this doesn't work because we aren't exactly fighting an army anymore. \n\n \n This is the thing, there just isn't that much good going on that is really newsworthy. I saw a 3 page article the other day about women holding government jobs in Iraq. NOT NEWS. Women have held government jobs in Iraq for years.\n \n One of the articles above that jim links has some news about some captured insurgents, but it was nobody important, just 5 guys out of thousands and thousands of insurgents. Hardly noteworthy. \n \n As far as rebuilding, I am not giving brownie points for rebuilding stuff that woudl not have to be rebuilt if we had not invaded. Just not gonna happen. I have noticed that the Bush adminsitration tends to speak in broad terms about rebuilding and focuses on dollar value as opposed to actual projects completed. This seems to have 2 purposes. One is pretty clearly to keep uncomfortable questions from arising about where all the rebuilding money is going (most is going to security or being siphoned off to military funds). The other is that it oculd lead to some uncomfortable questions abotu how things got destroyed. It is hard to get up there and brag about how we rebuilt a waterplant when we are the ones who blew it up, and there is a good chance that somebody is going to jump up and say \"HEY, why did we blow up a water plant to begin with?\"",

   "Another opinion", 
   "If I can jump in with my two cents on a few issues brought up in this thread:\n \n Balanced Reporting on Iraq: Where balanced reporting of the news in Iraq is concerned, I would agree that both positive and negative sides of the story need to be presented, but those presentations need to be weighed by which is more significant. If the nation is escalating into civil war, it is very important to highlight that. A story such as (for example) a new school being built by Americans in a small town that welcomes them might be a story worth mentioning in order to pick up morale, but those tiny bits of good news that are out there should not get as much press coverage as should the problems. I would love to see a balanced intelligent debate presented by both parties about how to get out of this mess with minimum harm - but perhaps that is wishful thinking. I would also mention that the press are limited, due to the high level of mortal danger, in how much reporting they can do out in the field in Iraq. Lastly, I do also hesitate when hearing opinions that either paint US intentions as being all-good or all-bad. The truth is always far more complicated - a mixture of some good intentions, poor execution, some corruption, a lot of arrogance, etc.\n \n Arab-Israeli conflict: When there are crimes being committed on both sides, it is hard to paint one side as innocent. I can sympathize with the insecurity Israelis must feel being surrounded by hostile Arab countries, but that does not justify building settlements and otherwise adding un-necessary fuel to a dangerous fire. It always surprises me that the most racist comments that I, personally, have ever heard have come from either conservative Israelis or conservative Jewish people who paint the Arabs as sub-human. On the Arab side, I have been shocked to see otherwise moderate muslims that I have met be completely supportive of the Palestinian's terrorist tactics. I was also quite disappointed to hear from a number of sources (a Israeli-Palestinian and an aid worker who has travelled in Palestine) that any successfull peace settlement would be viewed only as a stepping stone to further return of formerly Arab lands from the Israelis. In other words, there is no popular support for a peace solution that would permanently leave Israel in peace.",

   "And yet you have not shown that their target selection differs significantly from ours. Neither side seems to have any problem with blowing up civilians in order to reach their goals. The only difference is that on their side, it is necessary while on our side it it is not. They target our \"civilians\" because it is our \"civilians\" that they have a beef with. We target their civilains becuase it is easier and costs less than sticking exclusively to military targets. \n \n So, it would appear that in the gospel according to Jim, if you attack and kill civilains because it is convenient and cheap, that is OK, if you attack them because they are directly responsible for the circumstances leading to your grievance, and the only people with the power to address that grievance, then that is bad. does that pretty much sum it up?\nPerhaps it is your tendency to misinterpret and reword what I say that keeps you from seeing the difference that I describe. Their side has absolutely no problem with killing civilians. They plan for it. They plan for it on their end by directly targeting heavily populated civilian venues. They plan for it from us by surrounding themselves and their rocket launching stations with civilians in hopes we will kill many of them and have a lot of news coverage regarding the killings. You are either too dense or you deliberately ignore facts presented to you.\n \n ...and the answer to your question is , \"No.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n I don't screw it up. It seems like you generally just do not realize how stupid your argument is until somebody strips the rhetoric out and feeds it back to you.\nYour rephrasals generally include misrepresentations and illogical embellishments of what I write.\n \n \n \n\n That is my opinion based ENTIRELY on the facts. From the very start, and despite your completely unbacked and nonsensical claims to the contrary, the only real demand made of us has been that we remove ourselves from the middle east, and the reason given is that we have supported, and continue to support, tyrants there. Even a minimal amount of research shows that we do, indeed support tyrants there and historically we have been doing so for half a century. \n...as have other countries for centuries.\n \n \n \n\n They said \"get out and stop supporting tyrants\", we said \"NO\". The war continues. What other logical conclusion is there other than that we are fighting for our percieved right to support tyrants without interference from those pesky folks who have to live under those tyrants?\nMaybe you could explain why terrorist attacks are happening in other countries, at the whim of radical Muslims.\n \n \n \n\n No, we got rid of the tyrannical, oppressive leaders that we did not like. Then we helped install governments that nobody really seems to like, and are now helping to kill off the ooposition to those governments.\nI think your wording here is nothing but opinion. Be careful with things like \"nobody\", \"everybody\", \"always\", \"never\" and the ALL INCLUSIVE terms you so readily throw around.\n \n If I'm not mistaken, the governmental officials in Iraq today ran for office and were elected by the people. Somebody must have wanted them in control.\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=8737\n \n There is yoru thread, Jim. Thus far pretty much everybody seems to agree that tax cuts CAN help the economy, or they CAN hurt the economy, or they CAN have no effect. The current consesus seems to be that the current round of cuts is a bad thing. Now get over there and dazzle us with your wisdom and knowledge. \nNo, that is your thread. I doubt that a consensus on this forum is representative of the population in general. This board is replete with bitter bashers of the present government. The vocal ones tend to monopolize the bandwidth...y'all on one side...me and a few others on the other.\n \n ...and there you go again with your unsubstantiated \"everybody\" thinks this way BS.-\n \n You need to learn the meaning of consensus. 51/49 is not one.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n No, I thinkthe WTC was a legitimate target because the American people are the enemies. It is the American people who have allowed the situation to exist, have fed it for 50 years, and it is only the American people who can reverse it. With power comes responsibility. \n \n They attack our civilains because our civlians are the ones who have wronged them. Grow a pair of nuts and learn to take responsibility for your actions and the actions of your countrymen. \nMore and more I tend to perceive that you don't actually live in Kansas. I think your whole cyber-life is fictional.\n \n By your logic then, it appears that our bombing of civilians should be just as justified as their destruction of the WTC. After all, the terrorists come from civilian pools. If you're to give them blanket approval for all targets, we should be granted the same. \n \n \n \n\n Not at all, because in most countries where our enemies exist, the citizens have no power. They don't have the option of getting off their butts, wandering down to the local polling place and casting a vote to stop oppressing and killing millions. \nSo if the citizens can't vote, we shouldn't target them...if they can it's okay? The citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan can vote...therefore by your own logic, they are fair game for targeting...?\n \n \n \n\n In pointing out the situation regarding CIA offices at the WTC, I was merely highlighting the absolute absurdity of your position.\nNo, you were justifying the WTC as a legitimate target for Osama and his band of cowards to destroy.\n \n I'm not sure that you know what my position is anyway.

The vast majority of those civilains are not, however, terrorists. The vast majority of those killed at the WTC were, however, amercan citizens and eligible to vote.

Typically I have found that when it is difficult to pin down exactly what your opponents position IS, it means that they know their position is indefiensible.

   "After umpteen posts, there seem to be two distinct positions on the definition of terrorist:\n \n 1. Position A uses technology to kill enemies with civilian deaths considered collateral damage or necessary evil.\n \n 2. Position B uses personal weapons to kill enemies, defined as anyone in the immediate area.\n \n Position A defines a lack of intent as justification for killing civilians based on their method of delivery and condemns Position B for their delivery methods.

Therefore by your definition (or more properly, by applying your rhetoric), we were HIDING those resources among civilains and there fore the civilains killed were simply COLLATERAL DAMAGE and it is all OK.\nI recall telling you that I would likely NOT have pushed the button on the restuarant target. I have previously told you in no uncertain terms that I am not in favor of invading country after country and that a well placed bullet should suffice for taking out tyrannical leaders. I do not agree with everything that the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld triad does. You evidently misspoke in your third sentence where you say that we targeted civilian targets in hopes of taking out a few individuals. Actually, we targeted the individuals despite the fact that civilian deaths would occur as side effects (collateral damage, necessary evil, there may be other synonyms). Had Atta and Company been targeting the CIA, they could have hand delivered bombs to their front door. Their target was the American public, as it remains today among others. Their goals include disruption of peaceful life and instilling fear in the general population by repeatedly blowing up otherwise calm and peaceful public venues. It is you, NOT I that classifies the WTC as a legitimate target.\n \n \n \n\n Yea...and eventually they got whipped and had to leave. Now it is our turn to get whipped and have to leave. \n The ones who were whipped out of town had installed their own oppressive government and/or taxation systems. We do not plan to govern or tax Afghanistan, Iraq or any other country just as we did not plan to govern France when we liberated her of tyrannical German rule and we didn't plan to govern Germany or Japan when we (along with help from the Aussies and the Brits and the French Resistance and a few others) whipped their asses in WWII. [BTW, we killed a lot of civilians that time, too...blew up hundreds of thousands with just TWO BOMBS!!!]\n \n The US is not a colonizing country. Quite the contrary, it was formed by people who wanted to get out from under colonial rule and paying homage (and taxes) to some pompous monarch across the sea. What makes you think we've changed our principles?\n \n BTW, that was the most effective tax reduction we've had.\n \n \n \n\n Depends on the country and the circumstances.

You claim that most of the attacks are tied to support of the US. Can you name all of the attacks and show each one's tie to support of the US...and show me that at least 51% have the ties? Of course you can.\n \n What do you say to the some of them that are not tied to support of the US?\n \n \n \n\n This is true. A consensus on this forum is not representative of the population as a whole. Then again, a consensus is not required if you are asking a question like \"does lower taxes = a stronger economy\". In fact, in a case like that, a consesus is not useful at all. What is useful is facts. I note that you still have not put in an appearance to explain your position on that.\nAs I said earlier, I will start a thread when I find my hard copy of a report concerning this topic. [Unlike the report you never had, I actually have one. Maybe I'll scan it and post a pdf file that you can't edit.]\n \n Maybe you should watch spiders for a while and learn some patience.\n \n \n \n\n Here is what I said:\n \n \n \n Please highlight the portion where I say \"everybody thinks\" anything.

However, the logical extension of this would be that in a situation where the lost revenue was NOT being replaced by cash with an interest burden attached, it would help stimulate the economy withotu the downside. \nWe'll get to that in another thread. What you and gamehuis appear to ignore is that decreasing taxes actually increases government revenue from taxes because people spend more of their untaxed money on investments, jobs creations and consumer goods creating more revenue for the tax system. Lower taxes but more participation across the board. I don't want to hijack this thread either so there's no need to issue any more arrogant, boastful challeges here. I'll get to the economy/taxes topic in due time. \n \n \n \n\n I am well aware of the definition of \"consensus\". In the thread in which you were theoretically going to argue that tax cuts stimulate the economy, there is very definatly a consensus that this may not always be the case.\nPatently obvious. There's a general consensus that most things are either true or not. You've said nothing here. The only thing true about everybody is that everybody thinks. \n \n \n\n Now, head on over there and explain to us how we are wrong.\nAsked and answered.\n \n \n \n \n\n Yea...since I appluy logic to things and do not immediatly fall for the idiotic rhetoric that you do, I must be an enemy agent. Grow up, jim. Most of your arguments simply make no sense and are devoid of logic.\nComplete opinion. Apparently, you do not apply logic very well. Whether you are an enemy agent or not has little to do with how you apply logic. Your adhominem attacks are a sign of weakness on your part. \n \n \n \n\n YES, the terrorist come from civilian pools. The vast majority of those civilains are not, however, terrorists. The vast majority of those killed at the WTC were, however, amercan citizens and eligible to vote. It is not jsut the fact that our politicians were once civilians, it is the fact that they are wholly empowered by the civilians and that their antics and policies can only continue at the whim of the civilian population that makes our civilains different from civilians in other places.\n \nHere again, your eyes should be brown. You're repeating your claim that since the WTC was populated with voters it was a legitimate target. Then by your own past admissions and statements, the Baghdad restuarant was a legitimate target as you have previously argued that Saddam did indeed allow his subjects to vote. Make up your frickin' mind.\n \n \n \n\n If I were you, I would not want to accept this either, considering the fact that it was pretty much your generation that brought America to where it is. Your generations economic policies, that can really only have been crack induced, have brought us to the brink of economic disaster, and your foreign policy has let us to the point where we are loathed by much of the world, and a not insignificant portion of those who loathe us are actively working to destroy us. \nThis is laughable. My generation? I've lived through good and bad times. I was born in the middle of WWII. There have been various dips and rises in the overall welfare of the US since 1943. My recollections are that the best times have come after conservative hawks have taken over the reins of government from the liberal appeasers that somehow manage to raise taxes and screw up the economy when they get in the hotseat. The periods of higher general prosperity have taken place after tax cuts. Military strength is important as its provision spurs the economy also. Generally, when Republicans take over after inept Democrats have burdened us with higher taxes for the give-away programs and weakened our military to the point of dangerous insufficiency, the economy and safety of the nation are both bolstered.\n \n \n\n If their governments embark on a systematic program of oppression that lasts for decades, then yes, their civilians will be legitimate targets. \nSaddam was oppressive for 30 years. Does that count? Then was the restuarant a legitimate target?\n \n \n \n\n Jim, your position is difficult to pin down becuase it seems to shift with whatever BS rhetoric is popular with the neofascists on any given day.

Few can even comprehend the eventual standard of living for a two tiered society in a debtor nation with no industrial base or fiscal responsibility. But they will. Especially those who are still trying to accumulate retirement money.\n\n \n I personally have a high degree of respect for those of your generation who HAVE stepped forward (yourself included) and admitted that there is a serious problem and tried to do something about it. My father more or less thought like Jim for a long time. He was stuck int he mindset that the US was the worlds greatest economic power (which is correct) and that we always would be (which is incorrect) and that things that he knew damn well were irresponsible such as high debt loads and the deindustrialization of the US would not make a difference (also incorrect).\n \n I actually kind of chalk this up to a cold war mentality. Telling the population that they lived under the constant threat of nuclear anihilation, with our armed forces and a massive nuclear arsenal being seen as the only thing between the population and vaporization, fostered an almost childlike patriotism. It was no longer necessary to have a REASON to have pride in your nation, it was enough simply to display the pride whether it was warranted or not. A lot of what went on in both the public and private sectors didn't make a whole lot of sense, and people stopped even tryign to understand what was going on. They just comforted themselves with the idea that we were the big dogs on the block, rich, tough, and morally pure, adn that those floks in washington were making it that way and woudl ensure that it stayed that way. Unfortunatly, a lot of what was going on didn't seem to make sense because it was just downright idiotic, and what the folks in washington were primarily interested in was not keeping the US on top, it was transferring money for other peoples pockets to theirs.\n \n Now we are finding out that it DID make a difference, and that those things that did not make sense because they were downright idiotic are coming back to haunt us. \n \n The cold war helped forge and entire generations national identity. Now, years later, now that the soviet union is open and their records are available, we find that the cold war was largely a farce perpetrated by Us politicians to feed our military industrial complex....just a complex way of putting other peoples money in their pockets. In the course of doing so, the country was essentially bankrupted. We had a massive, expensive arms race with ourselves, and at the end of the day, it was not the US that beat the soviets, it was the mismanagement of their own economy.\n \n So, this huge event that forged the national identity of an entire generation turned out to be largely a big, steaming pile of monkey droppings. What do you do then? Adapting to a new reality has got to be difficult, but is also the only realistic option when confronted with facts, and the fact is, the economic and foreign policies of the last 30-40 years have been XXXX, and it has doomed this nation to almost certain failure.",

It just irks me, especially since a lot of those jokers are actually PROUD of what they have done.

It was an interesting experiment, but the end result has not been good.\n \n It is difficult to say what the world will look like in 5 or 10 years, but I can tell you this for sure. The US will look a lot more like a thrid world country than a superpower. The social aspects are virtually impossible to predict, so I can't really say whether those of us who can afford it will have to live behind high walls topped with razor wire and patrolled by armed guards or not, but that scenario looks more likely with every passing year. The one thing that we CAN say for sure is that it is Jims generation that did it. They blew through the national wealth that took over 150 years to build, and they did it in under 30 years.

   "I think that one's age and position in any society generally determines their opinions about that society. Joe average obviously has no idea the US is a declining empire. Unless on the government teat or employed by government money he/she obviously has some clue things are amiss with stagnated wages, loss of technical and professional jobs, inflation, cost of gasoline and other issues that have a personal impact. As long the escape mechanisms such as TV fare and large amounts of disposable time are in place, they could care less what the government does and how they do it. The US government could promote genocide and if it didn't interrupt TV programming, fine. \n \n Those who lived through WW2 and their immediate descendants are a different group. My father and people his age who fought WW2, a disappearing generation, have a distinct form of patriotism from actually having defended the US against enemies who attacked this country than do their descendants who merely enjoyed the prosperity following that war. Many of those descendants, again depending on their position in society and geographical location/peer groups, champion US military might based on WW2 without having actually experienced those struggles and in general support US aggression disguised as defense as they feel that aggression protects the prosperity their parents fought for in WW2. As with joe average, don't disturb the personal status quo and the government can do what it wants. \n \n Education plays a major role in the current attitude regarding US governing policies by my contemporaries. Almost without exception those I know on a personal basis educated in finance, social sciences, medicine and education feel government has been self-serving and irresponsible to a point of injustice during our post-WW2 prosperity. That includes a mix of traditional conservatives, liberals and independents. That group feels US direction and policy has been controlled by special interests for such a long period of time that the only hope of US citizens taking back their government is financial and social disaster, our current direction. A cure worse than the disease or cleansing action, depending on their financial positions. \n \n Those friends and acquaintances of my generation still employed within the private business sector in technical and general business pursuits (at my age that usually means a history of costly divorces and/or financial failures) are a mixed combination, with roughly half supporting US policy to keep their leaky financial boats afloat for one more pay cycle at a time and the other half bitter at foreign competition eliminating their former high-paying positions in inefficient entities. That group is either partially dependent on government contracts or hoping for a piece of one and most are astute enough to admit in private conversation that the US economy is failing but, like the spectator sports they worship, public negativity on any subject is a no-no as it might be viewed as a weakness. New Republicans all, with a sense of desperation and fascism in many of their opinions. As the years go by, I find their contrived optimism boring to a point of disgust. To retain two of them as personal friends, we no longer discuss politics or economics with hobbies in common. \n \n I think my generation's societal contribution has provided a really crummy circumstance for our descendants. I just hope, for their sake, that they're strong enough to cope with the changes required to fix the mess and partially forgive us for our greed, apathy and ignorance.",

   "\n This is the thing, there just isn't that much good going on that is really newsworthy. I saw a 3 page article the other day about women holding government jobs in Iraq. NOT NEWS. Women have held government jobs in Iraq for years.\n \n One of the articles above that jim links has some news about some captured insurgents, but it was nobody important, just 5 guys out of thousands and thousands of insurgents. Hardly noteworthy. \n \n As far as rebuilding, I am not giving brownie points for rebuilding stuff that woudl not have to be rebuilt if we had not invaded. Just not gonna happen. I have noticed that the Bush adminsitration tends to speak in broad terms about rebuilding and focuses on dollar value as opposed to actual projects completed. This seems to have 2 purposes. One is pretty clearly to keep uncomfortable questions from arising about where all the rebuilding money is going (most is going to security or being siphoned off to military funds). The other is that it oculd lead to some uncomfortable questions abotu how things got destroyed. It is hard to get up there and brag about how we rebuilt a waterplant when we are the ones who blew it up, and there is a good chance that somebody is going to jump up and say \"HEY, why did we blow up a water plant to begin with?\"\n Well, if anyone thought this would take 2 years (including the president) then they were fooling themselves. The goal is to create a democracy and have everyone happy..lalalala. This requires a change in culture and overall beliefs about people. In Vietnam it literally took 35 years for a culture change and it is only starting to be shown there....not only that, we were only one factor in a change there. To think the middle east can just go \"hey, lets be reasonable human beings\" is just not gonna happen overnight despite the wants of our McDonalds Drive-thru society (for the slow...I mean our society wants results immediatly). \n \n So I guess the question becomes, do you find it worth wild to stick it out for the decades it will take to actually \"win\" in Iraq...assuming we do win? Pulling out now would probably result in a situation similiar to Vietnam where the country muddles by for a few years and slowly becomes halfway between what we wanted it to become and what it used to be. If we stick it out we might have a free country in Iraq by the time I retire but this country will probably have spent trillions and countless lives doing so. After that you still have 4-5 countries to go before you make a middle east that wishes to live in a global society. \n \n I guess the principal I refer to is a common one found in multinational accounting classes. You have a culture which defines the accounting values which defines the accounting rules...well put that in a society standpoint. You have a culture that defines values that defines society rules. We now want to input the society rules and have it flow backwards to the culture....good luck with that. In accounting you want to put in the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and hope the culture changes to adopt them for the intended goal...good luck.",

It could last, you know, six days, six weeks. I doubt six months\n\n \n This was, IMO the problem with the core of the pro war argument. It was assumed by many, and most importantly the neocons leading the country, that our social, political, end economic system is so obviously vastly superior to anything else out there that anybody, given the chance, would immediately rush to embrace it in full. \n \n I personally have serious doubts that our actions in Vietnam had any effect at all. Look at other states that the soviet union was heavily involved in. Many are instituting similar reforms to those seen in Vietnam, and are doing so on about the same time line despite the fact that we never spent trillions there fighting wars. \n \n \nSo I guess the question becomes, do you find it worth wild to stick it out for the decades it will take to actually \"win\" in Iraq...assuming we do win?

After that you still have 4-5 countries to go before you make a middle east that wishes to live in a global society. \n\n \n I know you have reviewed some of our GAAP reports. Do we have trillions to spend on this experiment? Are we likely to see a net benefit within a reasonable time line that would justify those expenditures? \n \n I think you are mischarachterizing the ME when you talk about it taking years before they wish to live in a global society. It seems that they want to live in a global society NOW, they just want to do it on their terms instead of ours. Iran desperately wants to be taken seriously and wishes to be a player on the global stage. The only way that the US and some other western powers seem willing to allow this to happen is if they are disarmed and always dealing from a position of weakness.\n \n A similar phenomenon has taken place when it comes to China. China kind of snuck into the ranks of leading nations despite US attempts to stop them. Now we issue \"warnings\" to china about things like military spending, trade issues, and energy procurement. The implication is clear. The Chinese are welcome to be \"big dogs\", but only if they do it the way we want them to. We are happy to have them as a place to get cheap manufactured goods, but only if they are willing to be essentially disarmed, conduct business in the manner which we set forth, and not compete for critical resources, rather purchase those resources from western countries that get the contracts for development without inconvenient competition. \n \n This seems to be to be indicative of a paradigm shift that has been taking place over the last decade and will continue for the foreseeable future. For a long time, the west has essentially ruled the world. That rule is coming to an end. Already there is a fairly strong alliance of non aligned nations, and those nations continue to grow more powerful. The logic behind this from the non aligned nations standpoint is pretty simple. The world runs on oil. Without it, the world grinds to a halt. There is a limited amount of the stuff to be had. Wealth is created through manufacturing. These non western nations are essentially asking themselves why the west is running the world, when THEY, not the west, have all the oil and are doing a majority of the manufacturing. \n \n The argument that by failing to bow to US and western demands is somehow \"refusing to join the international community\" seems to be heavily reliant on the idea that the west is the world and if you are not doing as the west tells you, you are out of touch with the world and not part of the world community. \n \n I cannot even count the number of times that I have heard somebody from the Bush administration claim that Iran is isolating itself from the international community. At the same time, Iran has signed major trade deals with Russia, China, and Venezuela. The same week that Bush himself accused them of being isolationists, they put out a bid package related to maintenance on their (now operative) reactor, and made it clear that any company from any nation was free to bid on it. \n \n The fact that these nations in the ME want to do things their own way as opposed to simply doing what they are told and operating in whatever capacity we see fit to arbitrarily assign does not mean that they do not want to play ball. It means that they want rules that do not heavily favor the US and other western nations to the detriment of their own interests.",

Other countries ahve taken this to heart, including our allies who recognized that they missed a lot of opportunities when it came to china because they were aligned with the US on the issue. \n \n Look at Syria. Not long ago we declared unilateral sanctions against syria. The syrian president literally got on TV and laughed at them. In less than 30 days our European allies had rushed in there and filled the void that thsoe sanctions left. Syria also used those sanctions as an excuse to void US oil contracts and british and french oil interests lined up to bid for those contracts. 10 years ago they woudl not have dared. The Us would have said \"sanctions\" and no major player on the planet would have been willing to do business with Syria. Now we say \"sanction\" and the owrld laughs at us...syria becuase they know it will make no difference and the western world because they know they are going to see a large upswing in business.\n \n \n I dunno about this...maybe.

Iran is presumably going down the same road. It is difficult to develop a meaning full industrial infrastructure and attract expansion capital when your nation is under constant threat of attack. One of the primary roadblocks to ME investment has been infrastructure, the other has been israel. Iran needs nuclear power if they are going to move forward on the production side. There is really no question of that. Oil and NG are becoming too expensive an option when it comes to generating electricity. They need cheap electricity,k and given their resource availability, nuclear power is the only way they can really go. There simply are not many viable alternatives. \n \n Israel is a factor becuase they have a nasty tendancy to blow up advanced industrial facilities in other countries in the ME. Investors are going to have a hard time justifying capital investment when there is a risk that whatever militant lunatic is running israel at the time will decid to drop a precision guided munition on your production or power generation facility.\n \n Besides, those countries account for roughly 30% of the worlds oil supply and 40% of the worlds manufacturing capability. We shoudl be afraid of them, not the other way around.\n \n \nSeriously, the chances of China firing off a few nukes randomly is fairly small considering they are doing fairly ok now. With Iran, that risk just seems too high since they seem unwilling to develop anything worthwild. But you can correct me if I am wrong on this...i just know that if Iran acted like China then they would be in much better shape.\n\n \n Iran is acting EXACTLY like the chinese were. When the chinese developed nukes, it was the same tired doom and gloom from our politicians. Chinese dangerous...oppress own people...unreliable....blah blah blah.\n \n The iranians are essentialy dead ended when it comes to infrastructure development until they increase electrical generation capacity. They simply do not have the spare capacity to embark on a major overhaul of their industrial sector. \n \n Iran with nukes is no more dangerous than anywhere else with nukes. How many nations has Iran started wars with in the last decade? Now, how about the US and israel? Iran will keep their nules to themselves for the same reason everybody else does. MAD. The iranains are not goign to launch nukes at somebody when it woudl result in their entire nation being turned into glass.\n \n We oppose other countries having nukes not becuase we are especially concerned abotu nuclear attacks, but because as soon as they develop nukes, they are pretty much protected from US military intervention. For example, now that N Korea has nukes, there is simply no military solution for a war with N Korea. We attack N Korea, they take out a carrier battle group with a single nuke. War over...we have lost. The international community would almost certainly allow a nation to use nukes in such a defensive manner. Using them offensively would still be a recipe for disaster.",

They had their first nuclear missile in 1966. It was not until well into the 70's that they started any real economic or political reforms, and not until after the fall of the soviet union that they actually did anything useful. For gods sake, steeve, they were running over pro democracy protestors with tanks in 1989. \n \n Our dislike for the chines was based on the fact that they didn't follow our lead. They were communists, anti free market, and spurned our form of government. At the time, the same allegations were passed around about their leaders as well.....they are all crazy...inherently evil...blah blah blah. Does it really matter whether the pres of Iran believes in the holocaust or not? Outside of Europe, where to voice such things is a crime, very few historians manage to agree on exactly what happened during the holocaust or how many were killed. You are talking abotu somethign that a bunch of dead Germans did. It should not have any bearing at all on current world events. He used that because a large part of Israels diplomatic policy rests in playing the holocaust guilt card (thankfully this is becoming less effective). It was a dig at an enemy, no more, no less. \n \n To non Americans, a lot of George Bushs ramblings sound just as insane. I belong to a couple of mailing lists that contain multiple foreign members (\"British\" does not count as \"foreign\"). Most of them think that George Bush is absolutly insane. I spend a lot of time explaining that a lot of his statements are aimed at a poorly educated US public that is not interested in foreign affairs. They do not necessarily reflect the mans actual beliefs, they are propoganda aimed at getting his party re-elected and attempting to preserve some kind of legacy for the history books. \n \n When you listen to the pres of Iran talk, it is the same thing.

Different things are going to motivate them. \n \n \nPerhaps at the time it was a little risky. And in no way is Iran exactly like the Chinese.

Yeah, they had had nukes but developed other stuff at the same time. They weren't going around challenging the US president to a debate.\n\n \n I for one think that Bush should go for the debate. I think it would give the Us public a chance to see exactly how weak our position on this is. China low key? We almost went ot war with china over the Taiwan issue, and they have openly stated that their current military build up is aimed at beign able to defeat the US in an asian theater war. Less than a month ago the Chinese ambasssador to the UN got on TV (BBC) and said that the US needs to \"Shut up\" about Chinas military spending and that if Taiwan declares independace, China is going to war regardless of whether that means war with the US or not. \n \n When I say china snuck in, I do not mean that they were low key. I meant that they came in the back way despite our efforts to stop them. they simply grew big enough and powerful enough that we simply had no choice but to accept them. \n \n Iran has largely done the same thing, we are just throwing a hissy fit and trying not to take the final step of accepting them. If you go to the ME, there is a very definate sphere of US influence and a very definite sphere of Iranian influence. At one time the pro US nations were essentially Saudi arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, Iraq and Israel. The rest of the ME was largely under Iranian influence, with the exception of Egypt, which has always kind of done their own deal. Today, Kuwait has essentially been lost, Iraq has been lost (because despite the fact that we have spent a boatload of money there and committed thousands of troops, the ruling party in government is now the dawa party by a landslide, and they are the pro iranian party), Egypt is following the Iranian lead far more often (the result of a wide iranian influence on their population). We still have the UAE and Quatar, but both are non entities. Even Saudi Arabia has largely backed away from openly being a US puppet becuase of Irans massive influence on their population. \n \n The simple fact of the matter is, Iran is the regional leader in the middle east. For us to try to pretend that is not the case is simply foolish. They have sucessfully survived under 20 years of US sanctions. We did our best to keep it from happenign and failed.\n \n As far as the Iranian nuclear question....we made the same tired arguments regarding china and pakistant hat we are now hearing about iran. it was argued that both states could not have nukes, that they were different form other countries, becuase of their internally held ideaologies. MAD woudl not work because the people in charge were just insane. It was BS then and it is BS now.",

   "Way back at post #66\n \n \n \nJim follows neocon doctrine right down the line. Suggesting that killing innocent Iraqis, or Lebanese, might be wrong is, from Jim's viewpoint, blasphemy.\n\n \n \nWhy don't you speak for yourself and refrain from generalizing based on my desire to kill terrorists? You have no real grasp of what all of my doctrines are. ....\n \n \n \n\n \n \nJim, after reading the definition I posted, please tell me how it differs from your geopolitical stance. That definition, or label, fits your posted opinions on US actions against Vietnam, Iraq, Lebanon and any other country not adhering to US values or following US policy. ... \n \n \n\n \n \nI will respond to this after I read your link. I haven't the time to deal with it today. ....\n \n \n\n \n ....and here is my reply.\n \n \n\n Neocon 101\n \n Some basic questions answered.\n \n What do neoconservatives believe? \n \"Neocons\" believe that the United States should not be ashamed to use its unrivaled power - forcefully if necessary - to promote its values around the world.\nWhile I do agree we should not be ashamed to use our power, I don't know that I agree with the \"to\" part.\n \n \n Some even speak of the need to cultivate a US empire. \nI don't.\n \n \nNeoconservatives believe modern threats facing the US can no longer be reliably contained and therefore must be prevented, sometimes through preemptive military action.\nSome liberals agree with this, too. In the case of today's terrorists, a premptive action is required to prevent repeats of things like what happened on 9-11. A successful premptive arrest of some 17 terrorists in GB is a prime example of this. People who want to deal with terrorists on a law and order basis (wait 'til they break the law, then arrest them for trial.) will get us all killed...neocon or not.\n \n \n\n Most neocons believe that the US has allowed dangers to gather by not spending enough on defense and not confronting threats aggressively enough. One such threat, they contend, was Saddam Hussein and his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. Since the 1991 Gulf War, neocons relentlessly advocated Mr. Hussein's ouster. \nThen I guess Bill Clinton and all those in congress who came up with the Iraqi Freedom Act (that Bill signed into law) are neocons, too.\n \n \n\n Most neocons share unwavering support for Israel, which they see as crucial to US military sufficiency in a volatile region. \nI support Israel and their right to exist and defend themselves, but I do not see their existence as crucial to our military posture.\n \n \nThey also see Israel as a key outpost of democracy in a region ruled by despots. Believing that authoritarianism and theocracy have allowed anti-Americanism to flourish in the Middle East, neocons advocate the democratic transformation of the region, starting with Iraq. \n I think it started with Afghanistan.\n \n \nThey also believe the US is unnecessarily hampered by multilateral institutions, which they do not trust to effectively neutralize threats to global security.\nSpeaking of the no-balls, socialistic, liberal infested UN, I suppose I might fall into this category. Their are other multilateral functions (NATO being one) that do not appear to hamper our efforts. \n \n \n \n\n What are the roots of neoconservative beliefs? \n The original neocons were a small group of mostly Jewish liberal intellectuals who, in the 1960s and 70s, grew disenchanted with what they saw as the American left's social excesses and reluctance to spend adequately on defense. Many of these neocons worked in the 1970s for Democratic Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, a staunch anti-communist. By the 1980s, most neocons had become Republicans, finding in President Ronald Reagan an avenue for their aggressive approach of confronting the Soviet Union with bold rhetoric and steep hikes in military spending. After the Soviet Union's fall, the neocons decried what they saw as American complacency. In the 1990s, they warned of the dangers of reducing both America's defense spending and its role in the world. \n \n Unlike their predecessors, most younger neocons never experienced being left of center. They've always been \"Reagan\" Republicans. \n \n What is the difference between a neoconservative and a conservative? \n \n Liberals first applied the \"neo\" prefix to their comrades who broke ranks to become more conservative in the 1960s and 70s. The defectors remained more liberal on some domestic policy issues. But foreign policy stands have always defined neoconservatism. Where other conservatives favored d\u00e9tente and containment of the Soviet Union, neocons pushed direct confrontation, which became their raison d'etre during the 1970s and 80s. \nI have never favored direct military confrontation with the USSR. I would not have run from it if it came. I am proud of JFK for running their asses back to Russia when they started putting missile facilities in Cuba and I am proud of Ronald Reagan for outspending them in the cold war, but I never wanted to see us fight. I still think we could have whipped them if a war got started between us.\n \n \n\n Today, both conservatives and neocons favor a robust US military. But most conservatives express greater reservations about military intervention and so-called nation building. Neocons share no such reluctance. The post 9/11-campaigns against regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrate that the neocons are not afraid to force regime change and reshape hostile states in the American image.\nIt's not just your so-called neocons who want changes in the ME. I favor regime changes in the cases of despotic dictators and the death of all terrorists. The new government doesn't have to be in any certain image as long as the citizens have their basic civil rights and are not tortured and killed at the whim of some lame-brained maniac. Democracy is not required...peaceful living is.\n \n \n Neocons believe the US must do to whatever it takes to end state-supported terrorism. \nI do, too.\n \n \nFor most, this means an aggressive push for democracy in the Middle East. Even after 9/11, many other conservatives, particularly in the isolationist wing, view this as an overzealous dream with nightmarish consequences. \nDemocracy is not required. We get along quite well with many countries that are not democracies. The stopping of the terrorism is what is required.\n \n \n \n\n How have neoconservatives influenced US foreign policy? \n \n Finding a kindred spirit in President Reagan, neocons greatly influenced US foreign policy in the 1980s. \n \n But in the 1990s, neocon cries failed to spur much action. Outside of Reaganite think tanks and Israel's right-wing Likud Party, their calls for regime change in Iraq were deemed provocative and extremist by the political mainstream. With a few notable exceptions, such as President Bill Clinton's decision to launch isolated strikes at suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, their talk of preemptive military action was largely dismissed as overkill. \nHere again, the author fails to mention that congress passed a law and Bill signed it.\n \n Bill's sporadic spitball bombings were intended to take the heat off here at home where he was being roasted for molesting the hired help. (What a sleazebag bastard he is.)\n \n \n \n\n Despite being muted by a president who called for restraint and humility in foreign affairs, neocons used the 1990s to hone their message and craft their blueprint for American power. Their forward thinking and long-time ties to Republican circles helped many neocons win key posts in the Bush administration.\nThis is speculation. \n \n \nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 moved much of the Bush administration closer than ever to neoconservative foreign policy. Only days after 9/11, one of the top neoconservative think tanks in Washington, the Project for a New American Century, wrote an open letter to President Bush calling for regime change in Iraq. Before long, Bush, who campaigned in 2000 against nation building and excessive military intervention overseas, also began calling for regime change in Iraq. \nDimwits would have you believe it wasn't already an American policy goal...getting rid of Saddam. For the third time here, Bill signed the bill...BEFORE Bush got to the White House.\n \n The more i read, the more I see a numbnuts author spewing BS.\n \n \nIn a highly significant nod to neocon influence, Bush chose the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) as the venue for a key February 2003 speech in which he declared that a US victory in Iraq \"could begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace.\" AEI - the de facto headquarters for neconservative policy - had been calling for democratization of the Arab world for more than a decade. \nThat doesn't even mean GWB is a neocon. He's a politician.\n \n \nWhat does a neoconservative dream world look like? \n \n Neocons envision a world in which the United States is the unchallenged superpower, immune to threats. They believe that the US has a responsibility to act as a \"benevolent global hegemon.\" \nThat sounds like an oxymoron...benevolent hegemon.\n \n We are a super power and sometimes called upon to help protect the less powerful or the soundly defeated such as Italy, France, Poland in the 40s, Kuwait in the 80's, Israel since it was partitioned. We don't take over the countries we help.\n \n \nIn this capacity, the US would maintain an empire of sorts by helping to create democratic, economically liberal governments in place of \"failed states\" or oppressive regimes they deem threatening to the US or its interests. \nMaintaining an empire requires installing governors in new countries. We don't do that. We are a product of unempiring efforts. We opted out of an empire in 1776. We know that empires suck.\n \n \nIn the neocon dream world the entire Middle East would be democratized in the belief that this would eliminate a prime breeding ground for terrorists. \nI don't know that one directly follows the other. Democracy does not guarantee there will be no terrorism. We've had a few here...McVeigh, Rudolf, Columbine, Boston Strangler...I think the author is FOS.\n \n \nThis approach, they claim, is not only best for the US; it is best for the world. In their view, the world can only achieve peace through strong US leadership backed with credible force, not weak treaties to be disrespected by tyrants.\nCertainly when weak treaties are broken by tyrants, there is no drive for peace. There is still no credible argument that we are insisting on democracy everywhere. I don't insist on democracy...just peace and tranquility. Here again is a point on which I differ from the author's perfect little neocon. \n \n \n \n\n Any regime that is outwardly hostile to the US and could pose a threat would be confronted aggressively, not \"appeased\" or merely contained. \nSure...this is why we're planning an invasion of Venezuela...get serious.\n \n \n \nThe US military would be reconfigured around the world to allow for greater flexibility and quicker deployment to hot spots in the Middle East, as well as Central and Southeast Asia. The US would spend more on defense, particularly for high-tech, precision weaponry that could be used in preemptive strikes. It would work through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations when possible, but must never be constrained from acting in its best interests whenever necessary. \nI don't know how much reconfiguring is required...our military is already pretty flexible and mobile. We do continue to build large transport aircraft and quality armored vehicles. Weapons technology is important to maintain the big stick. I do agree that we should not be constrained by some socialistic World Government Group such as what Bill and Hillary are hoping to become leaders in.\n \n Despite some areas where your neoconservatives and I agree, I am not one, and do not intend to become one. I do not, as you claim, follow their doctrine right down the line.\n \n I neither require nor expect an apology or an admission of error.

I'm tired of trying to convince you to admit to that reality. Here are some links for you. Try reading them before you spout off again.\n \n \n http://mediamatters.org/items/200608220003\n \n In the mid-1990s, Harvard professor Samuel Huntington predicted that the 21st century would see a great clash of civilizations between Islam and the West. Nobody paid much attention. After all, we had just defeated communism. There was peace in the world. All was well.\n Then came 9-11, when we awoke to the fact that there are people out there who want to destroy us -- not just defeat us, but annihilate us.\n Why? There has been a lot of hand-wringing in the West about why they hate us. \"Maybe if we just got out of the Middle East,\" some say, \"or elected a new government, or abandoned the war on terror, maybe they would change their minds.\" Well, what the pundits don't realize is that this is a clash of civilizations. Armies of suicide bombers ought to tell us that their worldview matters more to them than life itself.\n The hard truth is that members of Islam's radical branches have no interest in coming to terms with non-Muslims, or even moderate Muslims. To put it bluntly, they don't care whether we're nice or not. To this breed of radical Muslims, there are only two options: convert or die.\n Does that sound drastic? Sure. But it's a fact.\n \n \n \n \n \n This is rather lengthy, but well documented. The 'convert or die' mantra has been around for a looooooonnnnnnnngggggg time.\n http://www.historyofjihad.org/\n The History of Jihad site is brought to you by a panel of contributors. This site is co-ordinated by Robin MacArthur with Mahomet Mostapha and Naim al Khoury, New Jersey. \n Other contributors to this site include professors and members of the faculty from the Universities of Stanford and Michigan (Ann Arbor), Kansas State University, Ohio State University, and the London School of Economics. We strongly suggest that this site be recommended as additional reading for students of Islamic History. \n We also invite students and professors of this subject to mirror this site on your University or private servers, link it up from your sites, to print it as a non-profit publication and refer it to students, journalists, cinematographers, military personnel, members of both houses of Congress, and Parliamentarians from your countries, members of the judiciary and most importantly to officers of the FBI, CIA, Scotland Yard, MI5, Mossad, FSB (Russian Secret Police) Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Ext\u00e9rieure (DGSE) and to all other stakeholders in the subjects of the Islam and the Jihad. \n \n \n What is Jihad: The Arabic word Jihad is derived from the root word Jahada (struggle). Jihad has come to mean an offensive war to be waged by Muslims against all non-Muslims to convert them to Islam on the pain of death. Jihad is enjoined on all Muslims by the Quran.\n \n \n While all forms of religious fanaticism are negative, only Islam raises slaughter of all Kafirs (non-Muslims) to a holy creed, it teaches Muslim to gloat over the killing of non-Muslims and celebrate their death. Hence Islam is the most demented and dangerous form of religious fanaticism. And it is not Islamic fanaticism that is to be blamed for this, as Islam itself is fanaticism.",

Your hatred for others has made you irrational. \n \n I ask you for some kind of reputable evidence to back your position, and you cite a hate page that does not link, or even properly credit, sources, and where the authors do not even have the balls to take credit, even going so far as to register the domain through a proxy service. Then you want me to go through and debunk the multi page rant of some worthless racist who is not even willing to step up and take credit for that rant? \n \n I can't help but notice that your other \"sources\" for your side of the \"convert or die\" debate are similar. If the best you can come up with for \"evidence\" is unsinged, unsourced, anonymous internet rants, then your argument is pretty weak.\n \n I also can't help but notice that when we discuss seizing SS and pension money from upcomgin retirees in order to help balance some of the spending spree they went on, you do not argue that the spending spree did not occur, nor do you argue that it was not wrong for them to spend all generations for the forseeable future into debt.

You recognize that your generation DID do these things...you just object to being held responsible for it and possibly for having to endure some negative consequences for those actions. On the issue of terrorism, you seem to accept that the US has done some pretty distateful things in the ME, and that those actions have resulted in widespread death and oppression, but rather than accepting that we are now seeing the consequences of those actions, you are arguing that it is not REALLY the consequences of those actions, but rather it is simply the irrational acts of a mad men. \n \n Is taking responsibility for ones actions really so horrifying a concept to you that you cannot even recognize the consequences when they are forced on you???",

   "In a way you are probably both right. If the ME is mad at us because they beleive we contributed to many deaths and oppression then it begs the question about why they have such an illogical response.\n\n \n How is their response illogical? You are not talking about people who can just vote the leaders who have pimped themselves out to America out of office. What options beyond violence do they actually have? Violence against their governments does not work because, as they learned trying to resist the house of saud, the Shah, and even in trying to overthrow Saddam, the US will prop up our dictators using military aid if needed. \n \n So, what are their options? They cannot take down the tyrants at home as long as they have the 800lb gorilla that is the united states behind them. they first have to remove the US from the picture. How woudl you suggest that they do it? Write a series of stong letters to the president? \n \n OBL laid out his plan for accomplishing this. He plans to bankrupt us. It worked against the Soviets, so he figures it will work against the US. Given our curretn economic situation, I would have to say his plan is good and is working better than he could have every hoped in his wildest wet dream. It si certainyl illogical for them to believe they can beat us militarily, but it is not illogical for them to attempt to beat us economically. \n \n \nThe hatred caused by years of whatever has gotten to the point where one just believes \"death to america\" because it was what they were taught. I doubt their religion helps and I doubt that us pulling out will change that (thats not to say we should stay). Furthermore, you gotta take into account the fact that this has been going on for hundreds of years (in one form or another). \n\n \n No, this really hasn't been going on for hundreds of years. This has been a whole new game primarily being played by our rules. You are correct about this not being somethign that can be fixed overnigt. Your argument here is similar to mine in regards to the Israeli situation. Israel seems to think that they can sign a piece of paper and expect attacks to suddenly end. In the real world, they have killed hudreds of thousands over the course of several decades. \n \n When you deo evil for decades, you must expect that it will take time for people to stop hating you. I would imagine at least a generation. Form a practical standpoint, I think we could expect a decline in organizational attacks (attacks carried out by groups like AQ) virtually immeditaly. There will probably be individual attacks or small group attacks for years. Without their hatred constantly being reinforced buy the death an oppression of arabs by US supported tyrants, I would expect attacks to taper off relatively quickly.\n \n \nFinally, a lot of this \"radicalizm\" can probably be blamed on the idea that they got nothing better to do. I suspect the average person in Iraq wants what many in the US want...a job, home, family, and some food. We probably coulda had more success in Iraq if we spent the billions of dollars on putting Iraqis to work (social work programs) like we did during the depression here. \n\n \n People do not go to war based on boredom. None of the 9/11 hijackers seemed like particularly bored individuals.

   "Riiight....Jim, how does youar argument differ from the argument that blacks are obviously a threat since they commit crimes at a higehr rate than whites, or that they are obviously inferior becuase they have not made the technological breakthroughs in Africa that they have in the western world? They don't. As far as I can tell, you are just as much a racist scumbag as Siegfriedson, who also strongly denied that he was actually a racist, he was just looking at the facts (provided by a bunch of racists). \nYou, being blinded by your own arrogance, will hardly ever see me as sensible. It is you that are mistaken....and you are a liar. \n \n \n \n\n I still have not exhausted the nazi line. Even your arguments regarding this issue are very similar to hitlers arguments against the jews. His initial targets were the orthodix jews because, he argued that both their race values and religon were responsible for all the negative social aspects he identiified in them. Same same. Hitler had a rather long list of \"historica precendent\" to back his position as well...and frankly they were a lot more convincing that the BS you are posting.\nTotal BS. My argument is that people who go around setting off bombs in public should be killed. I don't really give a rat's XXX what their race is. It just so happens that the main stream terrorist is a radical MUSLIM pig. I don't hate all Muslims and I don't wish them dead like Hitler wished ALL Jews dead.\n \n Your ridiculous comparison is noted\n \n \n \n\n Except, of course, if a bunch of irrational sand niggers decide they don't want you killing and oppressing them. Then it is ON.\nThose are your words not mine. You can't get away from deceptive presentations, can you?\n \n \n \n\n Jim, you linked an openly racist page that does not contain a SINGLE direct cite on the whole page, except for the islamic comic book page, and expect to be taken seriously??? Your hatred for others has made you irrational. \nRead it for the historical facts presented. Then refute the claims that these things happened. \n \n \n\n I ask you for some kind of reputable evidence to back your position, and you cite a hate page that does not link, or even properly credit, sources, and where the authors do not even have the balls to take credit, even going so far as to register the domain through a proxy service. Then you want me to go through and debunk the multi page rant of some worthless racist who is not even willing to step up and take credit for that rant? \nAs I said, there's a lot of history presented there...going back into the early centuries...just like I claimed has been the time span of the radical Muslim drive to kill everyone else. I have shown that these things happened. Regardless of the philosophies of the article writer, you should note the happenings and produce something that says these things didn't happen.\n \n I have refuted your claim that the 'convert or die' mantra doesn't exist. It's been that way for a looooonnnng time, Bubba!\n \n \n\n I can't help but notice that your other \"sources\" for your side of the \"convert or die\" debate are similar. If the best you can come up with for \"evidence\" is unsinged, unsourced, anonymous internet rants, then your argument is pretty weak.\nSee above.\n \n \n\n I also can't help but notice that when we discuss seizing SS and pension money from upcomgin retirees in order to help balance some of the spending spree they went on, you do not argue that the spending spree did not occur, nor do you argue that it was not wrong for them to spend all generations for the forseeable future into debt. When I suggest putting those of your genration on an island and letting the terrorists got to town becuase it was you guys who, either by ignorance or inaction, created the oppression and death that the terrorists object to, that you di not argue that your generation did not do this, just that you don't think that tossing you on an island to pat for it is a good idea.\nIt's a stupid idea...utterly stupid.\n \n I've already pointed out in one post that your ridiculous rant on my generation is aimed at both those who voted for and those who voted against those who actually passed the laws that screwed things up. You're desirous of punishing everybody rather than those who (you claim) did you wrong. That is much akin to Hitler's desire to kill all Jews, homosexuals and Gypsies rather than only those who had done him wrong. It is also diametrically opposed to my desire to punish (kill) only those who are doing me and the rest of the world wrong instead of killing all Muslims.\n \n I hated Jimmy Carter for what he did as President, but I didn't want to have him killed. You hate a generation for what you think it did to you and you want them all dead.\n \n If you replace 'radical Muslims' with those of my generation who voted for the polititians that made this current mess\n \n and\n replace 'Muslims' with my entire generation\n \n you'll probably be able to undertand that the close comparison between you and Hitler is evidently valid and the that the opposing contrast between me and Hitler is obvious.\n \n \n\n I see a definate commonality here. You recognize that your generation DID do these things...you just object to being held responsible for it and possibly for having to endure some negative consequences for those actions. On the issue of terrorism, you seem to accept that the US has done some pretty distateful things in the ME, and that those actions have resulted in widespread death and oppression, but rather than accepting that we are now seeing the consequences of those actions, you are arguing that it is not REALLY the consequences of those actions, but rather it is simply the irrational acts of a mad men. \nThere you go arguing for me again. Just because I don't comment on some of your tangential claims doesn't mean I agree with them. \n \n \n\n Is taking responsibility for ones actions really so horrifying a concept to you that you cannot even recognize the consequences when they are forced on you???\nI take responsibility for what I personally do. You can continue this Catch 22 argument for centuries and it will never end in a valid conclusion about who caused what to happen. You are simply too dense to realize the completely logical fashion in which I operate regarding terrorism. I will never understand the completely illogical stance the appeasers and excusers have regarding terrorists. Terrorists do not deserve civil rights. They deserve nothing but death.\n \n \n \n \n \n Kill emoticon_xkill all terrorists and those who support them!!!",

   "I disagree. This is pivotal to the debate regarding the \"war on terror\" and how it is fought.\n \n I believe, based primarily on the statement made by those who oppose us, that their primary grievance is the oppression and deaths that we have contributed to in the ME. My position is backed by nearly every public statement that any member of AlQueda has ever made.  \nYes, you do seem to trust the enemy more than you do our President. The press seems to do the same. Several US soldiers were arrested based on accusations by the enemy.\n \n \n \n\n Jim, on the other hand, seems to believe that their grievance is not a grievance as such, but rather essentially an illogical religous belief that compels them to kill or convert all who do not share their mythical belief system.\n \n If Jim is correct, the only logical response would be to fight a military campaign to wipe out those who hold the irrational religous beliefs. \nI'm glad you see a possiblity of my being correct...and that you understand the only solution. \n \n \n\n If, on the other hand, I am correct, then fighting a protracted military campaign which results in more death and oppression will almost without question make the situation worse.\nIn both cases, it will get worse before it's over.

It has become clear to the American public that America, this great and oppressive power, can also be struck and disgraced.\n\n \n So, this pretty much has nothing at all to do with converting people. he talks about striking America, ties become muslims becoming stronger, and the establishemnt of a new Caliphite.\n \n [\nlist]Ayman al-Zawahiri stated this last July \"The war with Israel is not about a treaty, a cease-fire agreement, Sykes-Picot borders, national zeal, or disputed borders. It is rather a jihad for the sake of God until the religion of God is established. It is jihad for the liberation of Palestine, all Palestine, as well as every land that was a home for Islam, from Andalusia to Iraq. The whole world is an open field for us.\" (SURE, just merely to drive out the US from the ME emoticon_rolleyes )[/list]\n\n \n This is CLOSE but still another lie from the bush administration (you really need to quite using proven liars as sources).\n \n What he said is:\n \n \nThe current serious events in Gaza and Lebanon prove to every sane person that the Crusader-Zionist war does not respect any ties or kinship. Nobody cared about the 10,000 prisoners in Israel's prisons while the world went into uproar after three Israeli soldiers [were kidnapped]. The war with Israel is not about a treaty, a cease-fire agreement, Sykes-Picot borders, national zeal, or disputed borders. It is rather a jihad for the sake of God until the religion of God is established. It is jihad for the liberation of Palestine, all Palestine, as well as every land that was a home for Islam, from Andalusia to Iraq. The whole world is an open field for us. As they attack us everywhere, we will attack them everywhere. As their armies got together to wage war on us, our nation will get together to fight them. The shells and missiles that tear apart the bodies of Muslims in Gaza and Lebanon are not purely Israeli. Rather, they come from and are financed by all countries of the Crusader alliance. Thus, all those who took part in the crime should pay the price. We cannot just stand idly by in humiliation while we see all these shells fall on our brothers in Gaza and Lebanon. How can we remain silent while we are the sons of Abu-Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Hamzah, Ja'far, Ali, Al-Husayn, Sa'd, Khalid, Talhah, Al-Zubayr, Ikrimah, Salah-al-Din, Yusuf Bin-Tashfin, and Muhammad al-Fatih [names of caliphs and Prophet Muhammad's companions]. We are the sons of those who fought the apostates, conquered the world, moved the people from the darkness of polytheism to the light of monotheism and from worshipping slaves to worshipping the God of slaves, put out the fire of the Magians, and conquered Constantinople. We are back to the field again, with the favor of God. \n\n \n http://www.centcom.mil/sites/uscentcom1/What%20Extremists%20Say/What%20Extremists%20Say%20Archive%201.aspx\n \n Whoops, another call for unity and justice and a US withdrawal from the ME, and another call for an end to tyranny, oppression and death. No discussion abotu converting anybody and no call for the complete destruction of America.\n \n In fact, in the next translated statement he says:\n \n \nI do not wish to move your feelings with an over-zealous speech or with an emotional address. But I ask you by God Almighty; by your love for God's messenger, may God's peace and blessings upon him; and by the obligation of jihad, which is a duty on every Muslim, to rise and seek martyrdom to hurt the Crusaders and the Zionists. The events that are taking place now show the significance of the two jihad fronts in Afghanistan and Iraq. All Muslims must support them in order to drive out the forces of America from them, paralyzed and powerless, and push them back to their country and make them pay the price for their aggression against the Muslims and their support for Israel. \n\n \n WOW, so they want to push us back into our country. That does not sound much like \"Kill every one of them\" to me. \n \n \nIranian pres. Ahmadinejad: \"Undoubtedly, I say that this slogan and goal is achievable, and with the support and power of God, we will soon experience a world without the United States and Zionism and will breathe in the brilliant time of Islamic sovereignty over today's world.\"(another mere call for the US to leave the ME . . . yeah right.)\n\n \n This one I really do not know about. The white house page is the only place it appears on the internet (though a few places do cite it, it always leads back to the white house page). They cite sharifnews.com, but I can not find it anywhere in their archives. What I CAN say for sure is that Ahmadinejad is NOT a member of AQ, and has not attacked the US. So I am a little confused abotu why you posted a quote from him here, real or not (but form the other 2 we can surmise that it is probably NOT real).\n \n \nThere is a lot more out there, but I'm not going to do anymore of your homework for you--you're making the assertion here by watering down Al Queda's goals despite what most everyone else in the world KNOWS. You need a serious reality check. Do some research.\n\n \n So far, you have just made a jackass of yourself. A tip...I have NEVER found anything on the white house page that checks out as true. Not once, not ever. \n \n As far as your assertion that most everybody in the world knows these things, that is called an \"appeal to the masses\" which is an \"appeal to ignorance\". You are essentially saying \"I don't have to prove it because everybody already knows it\". The problem is that everybody does NOT already know it. Ignorant partisan hacks all seem to \"know it\", but to the rest of us it is still a mystery. In fact, outside of the US, bery few people seem to \"know\" it. This is why we cannot get other countries to back our plays. Countries have trouble committing troops to fight for our self proclaimed right to murder and oppress people either directly or by proxy.\n \n Based on the actions of Al Qaeda down through the years, perhaps the most accurate is the unclassified definition given by our own Dept. of Defense:\n \n \n\"... established to recruit young Muslims into the Afghani Mujahideen and is aimed to establish Islamist states throughout the world, overthrow 'un-Islamic regimes', expel US soldiers and Western influence from the Gulf, and capture Jerusalem as a Muslim city.\"\n\n \n LOL and where did this come from??\n \n \nMoazzam Begg, while held in extrajudicial detention in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camps, requested a definition of al-Qaeda, when he was presented with a \"Summary of Evidence\" against him, in preparation for his Combatant Status Review Tribunal, which accused him of being a member of al-Qaeda, or the Taliban, or associated forces.[12] The unclassified definition offered to Begg by the US Department of Defense was:\n \n \"Al Qaeda is a radical Sunni Muslim umbrella organization established to recruit young Muslims into the Afghani Mujahideen and is aimed to establish Islamist states throughout the world, overthrow 'un-Islamic regimes', expel US soldiers and Western influence from the Gulf, and capture Jerusalem as a Muslim city.\" \n Begg also asked for, and was not provided with, a definition of al-Qaeda's \"associated forces\".\n",

   "Please reference the millions of deaths caused by Iran.\n\n \n When Khomeni took power one of the firast things that he did was purge 10's of thousands of soldiers left over from the Pahlavi Dynasty.\n \n \n\n In 1983 Iran launched three major, but unsuccessful, humanwave offensives, with huge losses, along the frontier. On February 6, Tehran, using 200,000 \"last reserve\" Pasdaran troops, attacked along a 40-kilometer stretch near Al Amarah, about 200 kilometers southeast of Baghdad. Backed by air, armor, and artillery support, Iran's six-division thrust was strong enough to break through. In response, Baghdad used massive air attacks, with more than 200 sorties, many flown by attack helicopters. More than 6,000 Iranians were killed that day, while achieving only minute gains. In April 1983, the Mandali-Baghdad northcentral sector witnessed fierce fighting, as repeated Iranian attacks were stopped by Iraqi mechanized and infantry divisions. Casualties were very high, and by the end of 1983, an estimated 120,000 Iranians and 60,000 Iraqis had been killed. Despite these losses, in 1983 Iran held a distinct advantage in the attempt to wage and eventually to win the war of attrition. \n \n By 1984 it was reported that some 300,000 Iranian soldiers and 250,000 Iraqi troops had been killed, or wounded. Most foreign military analysts felt that neither Iraq nor Iran used its modern equipment efficiently. Frequently, sophisticated materiel was left unused, when a massive modern assault could have won the battle for either side. Tanks and armored vehicles were dug in and used as artillery pieces, instead of being maneuvered to lead or to support an assault. William O. Staudenmaeir, a seasoned military analyst, reported that \"the land-computing sights on the Iraqi tanks [were] seldom used. This lower[ed] the accuracy of the T-62 tanks to World War II standards.\" In addition, both sides frequently abandoned heavy equipment in the battle zone because they lacked the skilled technical personnel needed to carry out minor repairs. \n \n Lacking the equipment to open secure passages through Iraqi minefields, and having too few tanks, the Iranian command again resorted to the human-wave tactic. In March 1984, an East European journalist claimed that he \"saw tens of thousands of children, roped together in groups of about twenty to prevent the faint-hearted from deserting, make such an attack.\" The Iranians made little, if any, progress despite these sacrifices. Perhaps as a result of this performance, Tehran, for the first time, used a regular army unit, the 92nd Armored Division, at the Battle of the Marshes a few weeks later. \n \n Casualty figures are highly uncertain, though estimates suggest more than one and a half million war and war-related casualties -- perhaps as many as a million people died, many more were wounded, and millions were made refugees. Iran acknowledged that nearly 300,000 people died in the war; estimates of the Iraqi dead range from 160,000 to 240,000. Iraq suffered an estimated 375,000 casualties, the equivalent of 5.6 million for a population the size of the United States. Another 60,000 were taken prisoner by the Iranians. Iran's losses may have included more than 1 million people killed or maimed. \n http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/iran-iraq.htm\n \n\n \n I thought that the Iraqi-Iranian War had more Iranian causalties.

   "You've taken one thing I said and tried to portray it a lot farther than I ever said. The gist of my take on terrorists is that they want Americans dead, and they do. I don't think they so much want people to convert as they do to kill westerners (\"infidels\").\n\n \n You said:\n \n \nNot to mention they really want the US wiped off the face of the earth, and for western civilization to become totalitarian Islamic. But let's not impede on the brain washing you've obviously fallen to, given the way you water down fundamentalist islamic extremism and play up the US worse than it is.\n\n \n And yet you cannot back this up. The simple fact of the matter is, their declared goals are to drive the US out of the ME and force us to stop supporting tyrants. Thats it. Since they talk abotu \"driving us back to N America\", it seems pretty unlikely that oneof their goals is to see us wiped off the face of the earth, and there is CERTAINLY nothign to indicate that they are trying to force western civilization towards totalitarian islam. \n \n \n \nNo. The only thing you've showed is that the WH didn't put the entire text of the document up. Big deal. emoticon_rolleyes The fact you think that is proof of some heavy editing only makes you look all the more like the paranoid conspiracy theorist that you are. Doesn't change the things that were said, nor does it change what their intentions were. After reading the whole thing, I'm that much more convinced the WH is right on target. But if letting your anti-war rags doing your thinking for you instead of thinking for yourself is your preference, go right ahead!\n\n \n Man, you are just wacked int he head, aren't you? Even you seemed to think that the WH editing completely changed the meaning, which is what you tried to claim that my quotes were mistranslations and from left wing web sites.\n \n Denile....not just a river in egypt anymore.\n \n \nWow! You out do yourself everytime you post, Daewoo. Why should I need to ask everyone if terrorism is evil? Or that it's wrong? Or that they want to kill Americans when they take any opportunity to do so when they can? That's like asking the average person \"do you REALLY think Nazism was a problem?\" You don't agree with those things. You defend terrorists right here, all the time. I'm saying you have no idea how out of the mainstream you are, and you don't. And let me guess . . . you're one of those people who think the moon landings were a hoax.\n\n \n You are right, I generally side with the folks who are FIGHTING injustice and tyranny. It is hard to look at a situation and realize that your side is wrong...especially when being wrong results in the death and oppression of millions. Applying the same standards to yourself that you apply to others is called \"integrity\"...something that many americans (according to you, most americans) seem to lack. \n \n \n \nThe problem is that you seem to only think it's wrong when the U.S. does it (or at least when your conspiracy rags tell you so), hence your completely one-sided take on things. That's why you have so little credibility on this. I don't think I've ever seen you truly condemn terrorism in these forums. (Not your revisionist history take on terrorism that redefines the U.S. as terrorist, but REAL terrorists that are beheading people, blowing up kids in the marketplaces, etc.) When it happens, you defend those actions by likening it to freedom fighters. Are you even able to bring yourself to condemn terrorism--ALL forms of terrorism, and not just what you think is terrorism on the U.S. side? Because if you did and made any sort of effort to present a balanced message (instead of U.S.-is-evil, terrorists-are-justifiable) it would go a LONG ways toward making you views seem a bit more reasonable. until then, the side of tyranny and oppression is YOUR side, and you defend it constantly.\n\n \n OR at least a long ways towards making my views more like yours. Heck, in no time at all I could be a total partisan hack that blindly follows the bush adminstration. Wouldn't that be fun!\n \n Balanced message? One side is responsible for the death and oppression of millions, and is fighting in order to maintain the ability to kill and oppress millions, while the other side is the killed and oppressed, and they are striking at the oppressors. There is not a whole lot of wiggle room there. If we stop supporitng tyrants and dictators and we are still attacked, THEN maybe we can complain. \n \n I still haev not heard anybody present a decent argument as to why the terrorists actions may NOT be justifiable. Nobody seems to be willing to try to argue that we have NOT oppressed and killed millions either directly or by proxy. The argument just seems to be that the terrorists actions are not justifiable because they are directed at the US.",

   "It is hard to look at a situation and realize that your side is wrong...especially when being wrong results in the death and oppression of millions.\n\n \n I think it's interesting how people here who can't really back up their radical assertions tend to use terms like \"millions\" when claiming how many the US is killed. It's no accident they rarely, if ever, given real and specific numbers, opting instead to talk in generalities phrased in such a way to give the most shock value. Not unlike the very propaganda machines they love to criticize so much. And then there's the fact that they say things like \"killed and oppressed\" millions--note how \"oppressed\" is a very subjective term and makes it easy to throw the shock-value term \"millions\" into the fray. \n \n The reason they don't give specfics, and choose instead to make a broad generality, is that they CAN'T specifically prove the U.S. has killed millions. So they throw in the word \"oppressed\" as well because that is such a subjective thing that it doesn't require backing it up. They can safely fall back on appealing to the idea that oppression could be anything, as an eye-of-the-beholder phenomenon, and therefore could claim (though not with real evidence) that the U.S. has oppressed millions. I also find it interesting how these generalities tend to get further and futher exagerated, from \"thousands\" (in other similar posts), to \"hundreds of thousands\", and now \"millions\". That's not to say it's the same poster every time, but the trend is there, with the posters who are arguing these views. (albeit, there are only 2 here that I know of who have this U.S.-is-evil, terrorists-are-good mentality--Daewoo and Georged.)\n \n Anyway, these tendencies are all a great example of how propaganda machines operate. It's the same sort of deceit carried out by whole countries at times, and at times the U.S. as well. \n \n \nNobody seems to be willing to try to argue that we have NOT oppressed and killed millions either directly or by proxy.\n\n \n You are asking people to prove a neagative. Perhaps if you could prove they have to begin with, (proper argumentation) it would go a long ways toward making people take your accusations seriously enough to even argue otherwise.",

   "LMAO.\n \n Are you delusional or stupid? It has to be one of the 2. We are responsible for the rule of the house of saud, which is generally considered the most totalitarian regime on the planet, it was the US who supported saddam and pushed him into going to war with Iran (which is subsequently why he thought he had permission to invade kuwait...but that is another story and not part of this list), we installed the Shah in Iran, which was without question the most totalitarian regime in the world until the sauds surpassed them. The US has stood by and allowed the illegal occupation by israel to continue, despite multiple UN resolutions demanding withdrawal (israel is in violation of more UN resolutions than any 5 countries). \n \n In addition to these direct actions, we have engaged in a multitude of indirect actions that are not likely to make us many friends. For example, we recently saw Israel invade lebanon, whihc even israel has now admitted was illegal, they just think they have a good excuse (but not a legal one). We could have stopped that the first day with a word, and everybody knows it. Instead, not only did we not give that word, we blocked any action by the US security council to stop it AND continued to send them emergency shipments of weapons. \n \n Now, lets put ourselves in lebanese shoes for a moment. Lets sat for a second that mexico attacks the US and is beating us badly (which is not an entirely impossible scenario, since the majority of our active combat ready troops are off elsewhere...the mexican army actually outnumbers us in men and equipment that is combat ready and on site right now). Now lets say that canada has the ability to basically stand up and say \"stop\", and mexico will stop. Instead, they say \"we are going to let them kill americans for a while\" AND they send them emergency shipments of weapons. To add insult to injury, not only do they not support a UN resolution to stop Mexicans from killing americans, they block it to ensure that nobody can stop the killing.\n \n Who is your enemy in that scenario? Is it just mexico, which is actually bombing Americans, but canada as well who not only had the power to stop it but didn't, but ensured that nobody ELSE could stop it, and provided the mexicans weapons and equipment during the course of the attack? \n \n Why is it that in your sick little world it is OK for the US to provide weapons and munitions to Israel in the course of an assault, despite the fact that we know ABSOLUTLY that they are bombing civilian targets, but it is not OK for nations to provide aid to Al Queda?

After this victory, the Iranians maintained the pressure on the remaining Iraqi forces, and President Saddam Hussein announced that the Iraqi units would withdraw from Iranian territory. Saddam ordered a withdrawal to the international borders, believing Iran would agree to end the war. Iran did not accept this withdrawal as the end of the conflict, and continued the war into Iraq. In late June 1982, Baghdad stated its willingness to negotiate a settlement of the war and to withdraw its forces from Iran. Iran refused. \n \n In July 1982 Iran launched Operation Ramadan on Iraqi territory, near Basra. Although Basra was within range of Iranian artillery, the clergy used \"human-wave\" attacks by the Pasdaran and Basij against the city's defenses, apparently waiting for a coup to topple Saddam Hussein. Tehran used Pasdaran forces and Basij volunteers in one of the biggest land battles since 1945. Ranging in age from only nine to more than fifty, these eager but relatively untrained soldiers swept over minefields and fortifications to clear safe paths for the tanks. All such assaults faced Iraqi artillery fire and received heavy casualties. The Iranians sustained an immmense number of casualties, but they enabled Iran to recover some territory before the Iraqis could repulse the bulk of the invading forces. \n http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/iran-iraq.htm \n \n",

And in 1982, IIRC, Iraq agreed to withdraw its troops but Iran vowed not to stop attacking Iraq until SH was dethroned. The bulk of the Iranian deaths occurred post 1982.\n\n \n Iraq agreed to withdraw their troops, BUT they were to keep Khouzestan and Shatt al-Arab, which were pretty much the focus of the war. Khouzestan hold nearly 65% of Iranian oil, contained their biggest refinery, and Khorramshahr was their biggest seaport. \n \n Instead, Iran staged a massive counter offensive (the battle of Khorramshahr) and drove Iraq back across the border. After Iraq had been pushed back across the border and the iranians were actually fighting on Iraq soil, Saddam offered a negotiated settlement than included handing back to hom territory that he has already been driven out of. The iranians would have been stupid to take such an offer, espcially with the majority of thier national wealth located in that territory.\n \n Iraq tried to do the same thing that israal just idd in lebanon, get everything you want in the ceasefire negotiations despite having lost the war. Saddam \"technically\" started the war? The picture people like ot toss around of Rumsfeld buddying up to saddam was taken when Rumsfeld was there to discuss the construction of the \"Khorramshahr pipeline\" which was going to be used to transport IRaqi oil to the city, where it would join the captured Iranian oil in being loaded on US oil tankers. The problem was, of course, that first saddam had to capture Khouzestan. The US was all about this. Not only would it help seal our energy needs, the iranians had removed the fascist ##### we had installed there and we were not happy about it.\n \n That si why saddam felt he had permission to invade Kuwait. He misunderstood a response from Bush as permission, and believed it was essentially his reward for fighting a multi billion dollar war that he did not particularly want, but was rather fought at the request of the US. He apparently did not understand that there IS no reward if you loose the war we ask you to fight. \n \n I have to say, I am a littledisapointed in global security on this one. In addition to leaving out some pretty major points in the explanation of the war, when they get tot he part about superpower involvement, they simply say that the US sent Iran some secret weapons shipments around 1985, and they imply this means we were supporting Iran, when in fact that was part of the Iran Contra affair. We had not put support behind IRan, we were trying to buy the release of US hostages and establish a cash flow to out a democratically elected government in S america.",

   "Iraq agreed to withdraw their troops, BUT they were to keep Khouzestan and Shatt al-Arab, which were pretty much the focus of the war. Khouzestan hold nearly 65% of Iranian oil, contained their biggest refinery, and Khorramshahr was their biggest seaport. \n \n\n Let's go back in history to the real causes of the war. In 1971 Iranians illegally settling on two iraqi islands located in the Persian Gulf near the outlet at Shatt El Arab. In 1975, Iran established frontiers on land belonging to Iraq according to pre-1971 borders. Iraq also feared a Shi'ia revolt as a result of Iranian radical Islamic propaganda being transmitted into Iraq from Iran. \n After the Ayatollah's henchmen decimated the Iranian military, SH believed that he'd be able to regain the lost territory and then some. What he didn't account for was the fanaticism of the radical Muslims in Iran and their willingness to die.\n \n \n\n Instead, Iran staged a massive counter offensive (the battle of Khorramshahr) and drove Iraq back across the border. After Iraq had been pushed back across the border and the iranians were actually fighting on Iraq soil, Saddam offered a negotiated settlement than included handing back to hom territory that he has already been driven out of. The iranians would have been stupid to take such an offer, espcially with the majority of thier national wealth located in that territory.\n \n Iraq tried to do the same thing that israal just idd in lebanon, get everything you want in the ceasefire negotiations despite having lost the war. Saddam \"technically\" started the war? The picture people like ot toss around of Rumsfeld buddying up to saddam was taken when Rumsfeld was there to discuss the construction of the \"Khorramshahr pipeline\" which was going to be used to transport IRaqi oil to the city, where it would join the captured Iranian oil in being loaded on US oil tankers. The problem was, of course, that first saddam had to capture Khouzestan. The US was all about this. Not only would it help seal our energy needs, the iranians had removed the fascist ##### we had installed there and we were not happy about it.\n \n That si why saddam felt he had permission to invade Kuwait. He misunderstood a response from Bush as permission, and believed it was essentially his reward for fighting a multi billion dollar war that he did not particularly want, but was rather fought at the request of the US. He apparently did not understand that there IS no reward if you loose the war we ask you to fight. \n \n I have to say, I am a littledisapointed in global security on this one. In addition to leaving out some pretty major points in the explanation of the war, when they get tot he part about superpower involvement, they simply say that the US sent Iran some secret weapons shipments around 1985, and they imply this means we were supporting Iran, when in fact that was part of the Iran Contra affair. We had not put support behind IRan, we were trying to buy the release of US hostages and establish a cash flow to out a democratically elected government in S america.\n\n \n The US did what the US has typically done in ME foreign affairs. It attempted to protect its own interests by making sure that neither side won the war. An Iranian victory would have meant the spread of Islamofascism across the ME.An Iraqi victory would have made the madman, Saddam Hussein, a powerful force in the region. By insuring the status quo, an imbalance was prevented.....or more precisely, delayed until the present. \n At some point in time, the piper must be paid.",

If not, then I apologize for the confusion. IMO, AQ isn't the biggest threat that the US faces. Radical Islam is the biggest threat; AQ is just a subset of that, IMO.\n I'd be more worried about millions of fanatical Iranians that don't think twice about using their kids to sweep minefields than I would a 10,000 strong organization like AQ. \n \n As for your assertion that there isn't a convert of die mantra:\n \n\n And Romia is the city we name Rome, the capital of Italy. The city of Herqel [Constantinople] was conquered in 1453 by the young Ottoman, aged 23, Muhammad Ibn Mourad, known by his nickname Muhammad the Conqueror. Nowadays, the conquest of the other city Romia [Rome] remains unfulfilled. Namely, Islam will return once more to Europe as a conqueror and as a victorious power after it was expelled twice from the continent....I assume that next time the conquest [of Europe] will not be achieved by the sword [i.e., war] but by preaching (daawa) and spreading the ideology [of Islam]....The conquest of Romia [Rome] and the expansion of Islam will reach all the areas where the sun shines and the moon appears [i.e., the entire world]....That will be the result of a planted seed and the beginning of the righteous Caliphate's return....[The Islamic Caliphate] deserves to lead the nation to the plains of victory.\n http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/arabic/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID=2042\n \n",

Methinks you shot yourself in the foot a little...\n\n \n \n Sorry, that was only half of what I wanted to post. I had to stop and do something in between thoughts. The first part was just to show that radical Islam's goal is to spread Islam around the globe so that it becomes the ONLY religion. The second part below is the proof that AQ wants the US to \"convert or die\". \n A video was just released by AQ calling on American soldiers to convert or die and a general appeal to all Americans to convert. \n \n\n Gadahn delivered a lecture on Islam and the \"errors\" in Christianity and Judaism. He also the United States is losing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and told U.S. soldiers they are fighting President Bush's \"crusades.\" \n \"Instead of killing yourself for Bush ... why not surrender to the truth (of Islam), escape from the unbelieving army and join the winning side. Time is running out so make the right choice before it's too late,\" he said.\n \n \"You know that if you die as an unbeliever in battle against the Muslims you're going straight to Hell without passing 'Go,'\" Gadahn said on the video, addressing American soldiers. \"You know you're considered by Bush and his bunch of warmongers as nothing more than expendable cannon fodder ... You know they couldn't care less about your safety and well-being.\"\n \n \"We send a special invitation (to convert to Islam) to all of you fighting Bush's crusader pipedream in Afghanistan, Iraq and wherever else 'W' has sent you to die. You know the war can't be won,\" he said, using Bush's nickname.\n \n Gadahn also urged other Americans to convert to Islam.\n \n \"It is time for the unbelievers to discard these incoherent and illogical beliefs,\" he said. \"Isn't it the time for the Christians, Jews, Buddhists and atheists to cast off the cloak of the spiritual darkness which enshrouds them and emerge into the light of Islam?\"\n http://powerlineblog.com/archives/015179.php\n \n\n Here's the actual video:\n http://hotair.com/archives/2006/09/02/video-al-qaeda-tells-us-to-convert-or-die/",
