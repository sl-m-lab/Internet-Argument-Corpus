   "Given the sales declines in their trucks I am not suprised. \n \n The asian companies however are coming on strong\n \n \n\n GM's car sales fell 1.6 percent and truck sales slid 7.8 percent for the month compared with May 2004. GM's sales are now off 5.2 percent for the year.\n \n At Ford, the No. 2 carmaker behind GM, new vehicle demand fell for the 12th straight month. Truck sales were down 6.4 percent, and total sales slipped nearly 3 percent for the Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands. Ford's U.S. business is off 4 percent for the first five months of the year\n \n There were some bright spots for domestic automakers. DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group said car sales rose 13 percent and truck sales were up 3 percent for the month\n \n Toyota Motor Corp.'s sales rose 7.8 percent last month, dragged down a bit by flat truck sales. Overall sales for the automaker are up 11.9 percent for the year.\n \n Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co.'s truck sales are up 23 percent for the year thanks to its new Tucson SUV, which had a record sales month in May. Hyundai's sales gained 8.5 percent for the month and 12.5 percent for the year\n \n Nissan Motor Co.'s truck sales are up 27 percent for the year, led by the Armada SUV. Nissan's sales jumped 15.5 percent in May and are up 15.8 percent for the year.\n \n \"We're getting on people's shopping lists for the first time\" in the SUV segment, said Jed Connelly, Nissan North America's senior vice president for sales and marketing.\n \n\n \n The trends for Nissan should be troubling to GM and Ford in particular. While overall sales for Nissan trucks are far lower then for GM or Ford, that previous \"loyal\" truck buyers are now cross shopping is a sign that Truck buyers when given an option are just as concerned about product quality and price and performance as car buyers.",

   "I've read the article twice and it is quite long. It dovetails with what the local finance manager at the Ford dealership told me sometime ago regarding incentives and profits. He did his quick calculation compared to GM and came up with $13 billion on the trucks alone that GM is having to eat. Ford is doing quite well with their trucks and so far as I can tell the article is fully factual and realistic. Compare this to GM's statements which are all fluff, hocus-pocus, smoke and mirrors. This is why I have been saying for some time that Ford will survive and be profitable but that GM is headed for Chapter 11.\n \n If I make make a personal observation I went north of Dallas yesterday to look at some outdoor equipment. (That's why I didn't do any posting yesterday.) I went about 360 miles yesterday. I was in my new 2005 F-150. It amazes he how quiet and comfortable this vehicle is. It is actually one of the best vehicles to travel over long distance being so roomy and well laid out. No squeaks; no rattles; no funny sounds. I haven't had a single thing go wrong or have had to take it back to the dealership except to change the oil and filter. If Ford does this well on all of its vehicles they'll do fine.

The Titan is OK, I suppose but I'm not enthralled with the styling. However, to its credit it is a full sized pickup and is 85% domestic content built here in America. The new Toyota pickup will be built in San Antonio and will probably follow Nissan's lead.

Then came along Lexus about 1990. The truth is that they merely filled a vacuum in the auto lineup. Neither the Cadillac or the Lincoln were truly super luxury vehicles with state of the art handling and technology. Both were gussied up Chevrolets and Fords. The Lexus especially was a totally different fish, had great styling and superb engine/transmission packages. The domestics just gave this market away.

The Japanese are certainly no better than the best domestic pick-ups. What exactly do they bring to the table that Ford and the soon to be released Chevrolet can't duplicate? The Tundra is undersized. The Titan is butt ugly and gets lousy fuel mileage. The Ford F-150 is damn near perfect except for the weight of the vehicle. It's heavier than it ought to be but it rides and handles like a dream. One thing that the domestics will always have over the Japanese is a vastly wider dealer network. I can't speak for everyone but that counts a lot for me. Otherwise I would have to drive 50-60 miles to have my vehicle serviced rather than 1 mile up the road and they even bring me home. I don't need the aggravation. And Toyota dealers have the well deserved reputation of being complete a-holes. Who needs that?",
