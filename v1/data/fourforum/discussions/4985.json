   "A rancher in southern Arizona shot a striped tiger (looks quite a bit like a Bengal tiger) a few years ago. Once native to the area, the tiger had been thought to be extinct since 1910.\n \n The black-footed ferret was once feared to be extinct, but a rancher near Meteetse, WY, found a colony of them. The Fish & Wildlife Service rounded all of them up - every single one - and took them into captivity to protect them. They promptly caught distemper and they all died. So the F&WS troops went back to the ranch and got some more.\n \n The common moral to all of these stories is that our biologists do a poor job of counting and/or estimating populations, and concerns about \"endangered\" species are invariably overrated.",

   "Sure, there are some that claim that the GTSAA (Great Texas Spotted XXX Ape) is extinct. Since they are the world's fastest animal, too fast to be detected by the human eye, some (Yankees) have even questioned their existence. Some in Texas, myself included, still use the old expression, \"faster than a Spotted XXX Ape\" to describe something that is REALLY fast. I have often felt that little whiff of cool air as a single GTSAA passed by, and a phenomenon called a twister or tornado can occur during mating season when they are running at full speed. I have been trying to bag a trophy GTSAA (male with at least 32 spots) for over 40 years. Believe me, it gets lonely sitting in a folding chair, drinking beer and holding out that net.\n I would tell you more, but the guard is here with my medication.\n Dono",
