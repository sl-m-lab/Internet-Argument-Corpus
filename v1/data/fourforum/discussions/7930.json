They also thought it was progress to hold hearings on people being communists, and to lock up a lot of Japanese Americans. Just because someone wants change doesn't mean it's automatically a good change.\n \n The prohibition of liquor was an effort to cleanse society of it's evil vices. Trying to control the lives of others. With prohibition came bootlegging which was as profitable as it was deadly.\n The McCarthy era was a three ring circus of propaganda and paranoia.\n The interment of Japanese Americans was also a result of the propaganda/paranoia machine.\n \n None of these things you mentioned were ever viewed as progress. Prohibition was suppossed to protect us from the evils of alchohol. Even those people who could drink without any problem at all.\n Both McCarthyism and Japanese American interment were for the purpose of national security so we were told. Even though neither one were a threat.\n \n But one thing they have never been considered is progress, not then and certainly not know. The one thing they do have in common with this issue at hand is denile of basic human rights. You went to jail or lost your job because a certain group of people decided that your political views had shades of pink. And after pink comes red, and if you're red you're a communist and that's not acceptable in this land we call free. If you're eyes are slanted, regardless of your citizenship, you have to go away to the camps. After all the enemy has slanted eyes too, so off you go.\n \n The only redeeming quality about prohibtion was that it denied the freedom to consume or manufacture alcohol to everyone, even though everyone was still consuming it and/or manufacturing anyway. The other two examples work perfectly to illustrate the unfairness of gay couples being unable to legally marry. Both liberal minded thinkers and Japanese Americans were harrassed and shunned and denied their rights because of who they were. And their fate was decided by a group of people who decided that slanted eyes and liberal thinking were just causes for mistreatment and discrimination.\n It's the same narrow minded thinking that is oppossing gay marriage. The denial of rights based upon an aspect of a person's being is wrong. Just 40 years ago, laws were finally enacted to make it a crime to discriminate based on skin color. And white people by and large were very offended by such laws. How dare the government tell us how we can or cannot treat black people. Many at that time viewed black equality as black superiority. They were threatened and enraged at the idea that their government was going out it's way to make sure these second class citizens were given the same rights and opportunities as white people. Today there are many who harbor that same sort of resentment in respect to gay rights. But it will change because baseless discrimination is wrong. Homosexuality is no longer a legitimate reason to keep people from enjoying and utilizing the same freedoms as those who are not homosexual.\n \n Either way, this isn't really about what's harmful or not--my statements about \"harm\" earlier was in answer to someone's questions; it's simply about what society has set up as standards, and the fact that convincing society to change its standards to accomodate your views is up to you. And whether or not the fact that you have that burden is just or not is not the bottom line either; it simply is that way because that's the state of our society. Tough situation for you, but them's the breaks.[/QUOTE]\n \n I remember the exact same philosophy in regards to black America.

You were saying that letting gays get married would \"harm\" the institution of marriage.\n\n \n The Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association, the world's largest organization of anthropologists, the people who study culture, releases the following statement in response to President Bush's call for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage as a threat to civilization. \n \n \"The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. Rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies. \n \n The Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association strongly opposes a constitutional amendment limiting marriage to heterosexual couples.\"\n http://www.aaanet.org/press/ma_stmt_marriage.htm",

What is \"justifiable\" is obviously an existing discussion. I'm not trying to deny it's not an existing or important discussion. I'm just trying to move it to a SEPARATE discussion to prevent potential circular arguments.\n \n The reasoning for doing so is born out of experience. I have had a variety of people make up arguments in the past saying that \"discrimination\" only means unjust discrimination, and since they believe that restricting gays is justified, then it can't be discrimination and thus can't be a 14th amendment issue.

(i.e. discrimination is not inherently unconstitutional. Discrimination without sufficient rationale for its existence is unconstitutional.)\n \n For that reason, and a variety of other similar circular arguments like that, I have made an effort to separate what \"discrimination\" and \"prejudice\" means as separate from whether or not they are JUSTIFIABLE forms of \"discrimination\" or \"prejudice\".\n That, and looking at the dictionary definitions of the words, you'll find that the \"right and wrong\" aspects are actually connotations that people place upon the words instead of actually listed denotations of the word...\n \n On an entirely separate and only partially related note, I can't tell you how many times I've had somebody claim that gays aren't discriminated against, but then proceed to admit that they support laws preventing gay military service and gay adoption and sodomy laws and ...\n \n And thanks for your replies to my questions.
