   "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c6ac0e82-4c9b-11db-b03c-0000779e2340.html\n \n \nPrices of existing homes fell for the first time in 11 years and the backlog of available homes for sale was at its highest since current measures began, underlining the significant slowdown in the housing market.\n \n Existing-home sales slipped 0.5 per cent to an annual rate of 6.30m units in August from a level of 6.33m July, according to the National Association of Realtors. They were 12.6 per cent down on the year before\n \n Economists had expected a fall in sales to 6.2m, following a sharp 4.1 per cent decline in sales in July.\n\n \n \nThe median existing home price was $225,000 in August, down 1.7 per cent from a year earlier - the first price fall since 1995 and the second biggest decline on record . \"This is the price correction we've been expecting - with sales stabilising, we should go back to positive price growth early next year,\" Mr Lereah said.\n\n \n \n What Lereah was very careful to word out of the statement is month to month pricing data, which generally the NAR releases. On a year to year basis, national median price was down 1.7%. On a month to month basis, it was down 2.7%.\n \n While year to year data is more important for those who already own their homes, MTM data is FAR more important to perspective buyers, and it is the prospective buyers who really matter in this scenario.\n \n Given the numbers released today, you would have to be borderline retarded to run out and buy a house right now. With the 2.7% month to month fall, and the 1.7% increase in saleable supply, and nothing at all on the horizon OR in the numbers to suggest that next months numbers are going to improve, a wait and see attitude is bound to be prevelant in the 2% of the country that has the ability to divide 225,000 by 231,200 on their own, as opposed to needing the NAR to do it for them (231,200 was the july median price). \n \n Unadjusted year to year inflationinAugust was 3.8%. The 1.7% decrease cited in the article is nominal dollars. This means that in constant dollars, the year to year loss is actually 5.5%.",

   "The transaction number, a 12.6% annual decrease in sales from 2005, is a serious economic impact.

Among other things, he still has commercial construction companies running and material costs are falling pretty drastically of late.\n\n \n As recently as six months ago getting a finish carpenter, electrician, plumber or other construction trades person to do a small job was like pulling teeth. One to two weeks or more, periodically calling to refresh their memory in full pest mode was the norm. Now I can get one to come out with 24-hrs notice, often on the same day, complete with a formerly rare customer satisfaction attitude. \n \n A flow-through effect from decreased sales is definitely there on labor and materials. I'd think real estate and home financing jobs have really taken a hit. Considering that the US is now primarily an internal transaction economy, I'd be curious as to the total GDP impact of the bubble bursting.",
