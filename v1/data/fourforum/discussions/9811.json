You have no right to disrupt a business with your religious beliefs. You know when you take the job you are to serve all customers and fill all prescriptions.

On this last point, the Supreme Court has ruled that sexual relations between consenting adults fall into the zone of privacy, and privacy is a right, not a privilege. And yes, employers do have to obey the laws, just as we all do. If we don't, we have to accept the consequences of not doing so. There are state and federal laws that many of us don't like, myself included. But we would be in awful shape if there were no federal or state laws at all! And it is society that creates the laws, both good laws and bad laws, through elected representatives or sometimes through direct popular votes. We don't yet live in a dictatorship, though some think we are headed that way. There are many laws that I abhor, but I do not abhor the idea that we should create laws or that we should adhere to them. \n \n It is true that employers cannot do anything they please and get away with it, nor should they be able to do so. Working people fought for years to force employers to pay slightly higher wages and to force employers to have safe workplaces and to force employers to recognize their unions. Consumers likewise fought to force business owners to produce safe products. The result of these efforts has been positive for all of us. We do not live in a laissez-faire economy in which employers can do as they please and workers and consumers have to suffer the consequences. \n \n As for free association, a business owner cannot refuse to serve people just because they dislike them.

Not sure what you mean here. If you mean the right to refuse to hire someone based upon sexual orientation then I see no problem with this. You can refuse to hire based upon many things if it impedes the point of your business...for example a \"all gay bar\" would be ok with not employing a straight person. The right to refuse service is one that anyone can do for most professions. \n \n So I'm not sure your point.\n\n \n In states and localities that have laws barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, a gay bar cannot refuse to hire someone who is heterosexual because of the person's sexual orientation. \n \n Employers throughout the United States can refuse to hire people mostly for whatever reason they want, except that they cannot refuse to hire someone because of their race, religion, sex, age, national origin, or disability (within certain boundaries laid out under the Americans With Disabilities Act).

If I was the owner of a pharmacy, I should have the right to fire that person for disrupting my pharmacy and chasing off my customers. \n Yeah, I agree...but only if you owned it...if the Christian owned it then I'd say he/she could sell whatever she wanted.\n \n\n If you truly feel that you can't give out those prescriptions, then work in a Christian Hospital where it is their policy to refuse those types of things. You have no right to disrupt a business with your religious beliefs.\n I dont think you have a right not to be fired...beliefs are rather irrelevant.\n \n \nAlso, religious organizations got an exemption from local discriminiation policies against gays because it is against their beliefs. Well, there are some christians that I would want nothing to do with either, but I'm not allowed to discriminate against them.\n\n \n \nLeaving Religion on the Federal Hate Crimes Protection list is totally unfair when religion wants the right to discriminate. You can't have it both ways (although you do right now).\nI don't think there should be a federal hate crimes protection list.\n \n \nAs you see no problem with discriminating against gays because of your beliefs then others should be able to discriminate against some Christians if you don't want to hire them because of their beliefs.

   "Hate crime laws are really more about punishment than laws against doing something. The problem with hate crime laws is that it is a form of law based more on subjectivism than empirical evidence. Whereas other standards for sentencing are based on the crime as determined by evidence (e.g. mandatory minimum sentencing for 1st degree murder), sentencing standards for hate crime laws are based on perception of someone's hate toward a group. Every case is going to be a judgment call about someone's biases and views. Optimistically, we hope that the evidence someone hate a group is clear, but it is not always so clear cut--unlike empirical evidence of fingerprints or DNA testing. It is a dangerous direction for our laws to go in. That's not to say, of course, that some cases of hate crimes are very clear so that it doesn't require much judgment to conclude what it is. An example of this is when someone comes right and admits that they killed someone because of their skin color, for instance. But for many cases there is enormous subjectivism invloved. I've heard the statement before that \"every murder is a hate crime\" and I think to some degree that is true, at least if the murder is premeditated. The general definition that makes a crime a hate crime is that used by the FBI. Most states defer to that standard. But the FBI definition for a hate crime is \"a criminal offense committed against a person, property or society which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin.\" (http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_98/) Determining such is very much a judgment call that has much to do with what is perceived.\n \n Another problem is that proponents of hate crime laws often claim the laws are there to give more protection toward minorities, but they never (that I have seen) offer any proof that minorities are really any more protected than they would be by laws that already make murder and violence illegal, and punish people. Sometimes hate crime laws are even proposed on the basis that the govt. doesn't do enough to prosecute or punish using the laws we currently have (which are certainly enough--life in prison or capital punishment for instance for murder, and prison time for assault), but that really only reveals that the problem is not the need for more laws, but for the laws and system that are already in place to be used better. I get the impression sometimes that proponents of hate crime laws arbitrarily support them just on the basis that they are told the laws protect minorities. That is not good and comprehensive reasoning--laws need to be evaluated based on the effect they will have on the whole system, how well they fit into our legal system, and whether or not they give too much power to the govt., not merely because we are told by their proponents that they are good. There are other issues afoot.",

So that's kinda dumb.\n \n (Third, I like Ohioprof's clarification that bias crime is a more fitting term.)\n \n The issue here is intent. This gets conflated to concern about Orwellian \"thought crimes.\" But we punish people for their thoughts, i.e. intent, all the time.

Manslaughter has minimum sentencing regardless of the motive of the crime. Hate crime laws go above and beyond that, and raise motive itself to the level of the crime. That is the very problem here.\n \n \n \n Yes, that is what I just said! But you said just a second ago that it is based on motive, not the crime. Pre-meditated murder can have one or more of many possible motives. Pre-meditated murder is not an example of a motive; it is an example of the crime.\n\n \n A bias crime is also an example of the crime. In cases of murder, for example, the motive DOES matter, because intent determines whether a charge is first-degree murder or second-degree murder or manslaughter. Motive is always a factor in determining the nature of a crime. The specific motive in particular cases will vary, of course, because the circumstances of each crime are different. But if I run my wife over with my car deliberately to kill her for her life insurance money, that's different from my accidentally running her over with my car because I didn't see her standing there, and I should and will be charged differently. The motive changes the nature of the crime. That is true in bias crime cases as well. And in bias crime cases, as in any criminal case, there has to be evidence to support the charges. Bias crime laws are no more \"subjective\" than any other laws. You just don't happen to like them, apparently.",

It still criminalizes motive even if you have to have a different action to make it proescutable. To use another law as analogy, it is against the law to not wear a seatbelt. But in most states, you can only be charged with that if you are caught doing something else. (such as speeding). Doesn't make not wearing your seat belt any less a crime. Just because you have to have to committed a crime in the first place to have bias raise it to the level of a hate crime doesn't mean the bias isn't being criminalized in those cases.\n \n \nIt's like saying that having a gun is a crime because some people who committed a crime with a gun got prosecuted. In fact, having a gun during committing a crime will often result in a more harsh sentence.\n\n \n Well yes that is a good example and doesn't refute anything I'm saying! I never claimed bias was prosecutable independently. That is beside the point. Carrying a gun or using it in a crime IS a crime, just as we have criminalized motive in cases of hate crimes. Notice that OTHER motives are not spelled out in law as being a type of crime. For instance, there is no set of laws called \"jealousy crime\" where the motive of jealousy has led someone to kill someone, such as we have with the motive of bias.\n \n \nQuite frankly, motive has a LONG HISTORY of being considered during the sentencing phase of the trial.\n\n \n You keep missing the point. The point is that these other motives don't have LAWS specifically about them raising them to criminal status. Bias does. In that sense they are very unusual in our laws. \n \n \nAnd for the record, how the heck does this give the government power? It doesn't take anybody's rights away.\n\n \n It doesn't??? It certainly gives the judicial system more power to increase sentences based on perception of bias. I don't see how in the world you can say that doesn't give the govt. more power. Or did you forget the judicial system is a part of our govt? \n \n \nThe government is acting on EXISTING crimes, handing down SPECIFIC punishments that SOCIETY DICTATES.\n It's government of the people, by the people, for the people.\n\n \n Yes, I've noticed your posts suddenly start viewing it that way (\"of the people, by the people, for the people\") when it's convenient.

Getting smarmy doesn't have a status in our law with a set of laws concerning it. There are no \"Smarmy Crime Laws\", Foundit. You're missing the point by a mile here.

What matters is that in any criminal case, the prosecution must present evidence, and that evidence must be weighed by a jury. False reports are not going to lead to a criminal conviction if there is no evidence to support them. \n \n The Wikipedia author also expresses his fear that bias crime laws will lead us down a slippery slope of convictions of people for their opinions and not for actual crimes. The Wikipedia author apparently forgets that we have the first amendment, and we have the Supreme Court to strike down laws that violate free expression. We have had bias crime laws for some time now, and they have not led to laws that prohibit free expression, at least none that I know of. As a friend of mine who worked as an ACLU lawyer explained to me, the bias is not the crime. But expressions of bias may be evidence of the crime. \n \n The Wikipedia author also points to cases in which enhanced penalties for bias crimes have not been necessary, and there certainly are such cases. Pre-meditated murder is likely to carry a severe enough penalty that it doesn't need to be enhanced.

   "You're comparing motive to harm someone or an institution with motive that is simply bias. The two are not the same thing. If someone has a motive to harm someone or an institution, then it should be a crime. Bias isn't necessarily the same thing. With hate crime law, bias is being criminalized here regardless of whether or not it was what was behind the crime. I realize you have no problem with that, but nevertheless it is very different than the examples you gave. With intent to sell drugs, you aren't sentencing them for being a drug seller. With bias crime sentencing, you're sentencing them for bias against a group, which is something happening independent of the crime itself. It's true that the bias reinforced or led them to commit the crime, but you're not just punishing motive in regards to the crime--they didn't commit a crime against the whole group, after all, but against one person (in most cases). If you were only punishing them in regards to the crime, you wouldn't be using hate crime law, since our laws already fully support motive for the crime without bringing hate crime laws into the picture.\n\n \n This is not an accurate explanation of bias crime laws. The laws do NOT criminialize bias. They address criminal acts that are motivated by bias. There can be no sentencing for bias \"independent of the crime itself,\" to quote you. \n \n I also do not view bias crime laws as punishment for crimes committed against a whole group. My reading of bias crime laws is that they punish the specific crime committed against specific victims, and it's inaccurate to say that they punish bias against a group.

It's usually difficult to attribute any specific hate crime to a particular piece of anti-gay propaganda, but I think it is true that anti-gay activists who foment a climate of hatred make it easier for violent hotheads to commit their crimes, especially when they subsequently condone or at least fail to condemn them. And even when anti-gay activists condemn a piece of gay-bashing, it's all too often accompanied by some sort of excuse that gays bring it on themselves or somehow deserve it, which basically exonerates the culprit.\n \n I know some gay activists oppose hate crime laws in principle, because of issues of free speech, however, I don't fully agree with them.

Almost 8 out of 10 Americans say they support the current legislation.\n \n . . .\n \n The second question asks about the expansion of the hate crime legislation to include the victim's gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Support for the expansion is somewhat lower than support for the existing law, but still very substantial. \n The totals were 78%-18% for the first question, 68%-27% for the second.\n \n The demographic breakdown and balance of the press release can be found on the Gallup website: http://www.galluppoll.com/content/default.aspx?ci=27613",

Think about it--you can't terrorize someone while doing absolutely nothing to them. But you can hate someone without doing anything to them. Hate is not the same as doing something; it is acting on hate that is a crime. But there is no such thing as terrorizing someone without acting it out.

   "Quote:\n GALLUP NEWS SERVICE\n \n PRINCETON, NJ -- A substantial majority of the American public favors the expansion of federal hate crime legislation to include crimes against people based on their gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The U.S. House of Representatives has passed such legislation, which is now being considered by the Senate. Republicans, conservatives, and religious Americans are slightly less likely than others to favor the expansion of hate crime legislation, but a majority of those in each of these conservative and religious groups favors the proposed legislation. \n \n . . .\n \n A May 10-13, 2007, national Gallup Poll included two questions about federal hate crime laws. The first asked about the current federal law that covers hate crimes committed on the basis of the victim's race, color, religion, or national origin. Almost 8 out of 10 Americans say they support the current legislation.\n \n . . .\n \n The second question asks about the expansion of the hate crime legislation to include the victim's gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Support for the expansion is somewhat lower than support for the existing law, but still very substantial. \n \n The totals were 78%-18% for the first question, 68%-27% for the second.\n \n \nBush's threat of a veto is inconsistant with the public position.\n\n \n It is interesting that the percentages are fairly similar to those who favor/oppose homosexual unions. We do wish to be consistent with the public position do we not?",

   "Using that example in the context of hate crime laws, there is a subtle but important difference. Terrorism is a concrete act. It is something done that has visible results. Hate is more in the realm of emotion and feelings, and goes on in someone's mind. It is an intent in and of itself. Think about it--you can't terrorize someone while doing absolutely nothing to them. But you can hate someone without doing anything to them. Hate is not the same as doing something; it is acting on hate that is a crime. But there is no such thing as terrorizing someone without acting it out. Terrorism is not subjective--if someone bombs a clinic, it's terrorism, based on the act. The act is done and the judgement of intent isn't based on the emotion of the victim (e.g. hate), but the act itself.\n\n \n Hate crimes laws are not intended to criminalize the emotion of hate. I don't know why you continue to fail to understand this, especially after it has been pointed out repeatedly. Merely hating someone is not illegal. \n \n Similarly, anti-terrorizism laws are not intended to criminalize the desire to terrorize. Both are laws against the \"concrete act\" that is subsequent to the intent. You can't really be that concrete in your thinking, can you?\n \n Terrorism, apparently, is indeed subjective, as the federal judge is now attempting to decide whether the environmnentalist actions qualify as that or not. If they merely intended to destroy property, it is not terrorism. If they intended to alter public policy through their violence, it is terrorism. The action of their violence is not in doubt. They have plead guilty to this. The judge is now in a position to decide their intent.",

It's not just you being attacked then, it's everyone who shares your identifying characteristics that caused the attack.\n\n \n If someone plans to break into your house and leave anti-gay slogans in your house, whether he actually hated gay people should not be the determining factor in the crime he is charged with. He should be charged with breaking into your house and leaving anti-gay slogans. If causing fear in the community naturally flows from that intent, then he should be charged with causing fear. Why he did it should not be a component of the crime because any reason would be equally bad to do such a thing. Hating you because you're richer than he is not and should not be somehow more acceptable to the law than hating you because you're gay because personal bias should not be criminalized.\n \n \nI can understand the principled position behind opposition to all hate crime laws -- a number of gay activists have shared it. I just don't think it's completely fair to paint them as actions against freedom of opinion.\n\n \n Supporting hate-crime legislation that criminalizes personal bias as a motive does indeed criminalize opinion in addition to the crime they committed. That's a perversion of our justice system.\n \n MrWriteLA,\n \nThis is what so many of the critics of the legislation here fail to realize. The law doesn't give special status to gays. If THEY -- purportedly heterosexual -- are attacked because they are PERCEIVED to be homosexual (perhaps because they spend an inordinate amount of time on gay chat boards), or if they are attacked by a gay person BECAUSE they are heterosexual (yeah, right, like that happens), the perpetrator would be subject to the same bias crime penalties. So what's the problem?\n\n \n It is preferencial treatment for the protected groups because it treats the same beating as a worse crime if he does it to you because you're gay. So if he performs the same beating on someone else for their wallet it isn't as bad. That is unequal protection. It persecutes those who have a certain belief to a greater extent. That would be unequal protection because of personal beliefs. It also implies that the fear of those protected groups is somehow more worthy of protection than those who do not belong to that group. The fear a man feels as a straight man is no more worthy of protection than than the fear a black man would feel in the same area that beatings happen.",

   "I know I said I was done. But here is a ruling from that left-wing pinko, William Rehnquist:\n \n WISCONSIN, PETITIONER v. TODD MITCHELL\n SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n 508 U.S. 476\n June 11, 1993, Decided\n REHNQUIST, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. \n \n \nMoreover, the Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement bias-inspired conduct because this conduct is thought to inflict greater individual and societal harm. For example, according to the State and its amici, bias-motivated crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and incite community unrest. The State's desire to redress these perceived harms provides an adequate explanation for its penalty-enhancement provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders' beliefs or biases. As Blackstone said long ago, \"it is but reasonable that among crimes of different natures those should be most severely punished, which are the most destructive of the public safety and happiness.\" \n \n Finally, there remains to be considered Mitchell's argument that the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because of its \"chilling effect\" on free speech. Mitchell argues (and the Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed) that the statute is \"overbroad\" because evidence of the defendant's prior speech or associations may be used to prove that the defendant intentionally selected his victim on account of the victim's protected status. Consequently, the argument goes, the statute impermissibly chills free expression with respect to such matters by those concerned about the possibility of enhanced sentences if they should in the future commit a criminal offense covered by the statute. We find no merit in this contention. \n \n The sort of chill envisioned here is far more attenuated and unlikely than that contemplated in traditional \"over-breadth\" cases. We must conjure up a vision of a Wisconsin citizen suppressing his unpopular bigoted opinions for fear that if he later commits an offense covered by the statute, these opinions will be offered at trial to establish that he selected his victim on account of the victim's protected status, thus qualifying him for penalty enhancement. To stay within the realm of rationality, we must surely put to one side minor misdemeanor offenses covered by the statute, such as negligent operation of a motor vehicle; for it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of a situation where such offenses would be racially motivated. We are left, then, with the prospect of a citizen suppressing his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of such beliefs will be introduced against him at trial if he commits a more serious offense against person or property. This is simply too speculative a hypothesis to support Mitchell's overbreadth claim. \n \n \n The First Amendment, moreover, does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent. Evidence of a defendant's previous declarations or statements is commonly admitted in criminal trials subject to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability, and the like. . \n \n\n \n Wisconsin v.

Hate crimes only change the crime when directed at \"protected groups\" and only are in use if the crime is motivated by bias against those groups. I hope you can agree with me that such \"bias motivated crimes\" should not be on the books and instead crimes that are intended to cause fear among any community or group should be criminalized equally as a form of terrorism. That would eliminate the inequality (whether real or simply perceived) and end the outcry of favoritism, etc, while still protecting those groups just as well. Saying \"I hate gay people\" isn't a crime, but it apparently is part of a crime to actually hate gay people. Hate crime laws just don't make sense.",

That makes personal opinion a crime in addition to the action and intent of the perpetrator.\n \n Why do you continue to support this? Do you believe it would not accomplish your goal if such perpetrators are charged as their action and intent warrant instead of using bias to change the crime?",
