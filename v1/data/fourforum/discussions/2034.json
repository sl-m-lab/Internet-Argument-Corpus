   "You are kidding yourself if you think that a suicide bomber is cowardly, and doing it in a very dangerous way. I also know the innoncence of children isn't all its cracked up to be (they're incredably self centred b******* on the whole), not having kids of my own.\n Also from a point of view of someone who thinks its right and that they will get into heaven for it, it makes sense. Children are often the most accepting of Faith, having not come to question it yet and will beleive an adult ultimately if the adult themselves appears to beleive it (which I certainly think they do, these are not people who think they are doing evil). Also gets a point of a competely united people against an oppressor and is especailly effective against us as we are used to the idea of sterotyping a suicide bomber as some evil monster, not just some guy and certainly not a 'innocent child'.\n \n As long as the conditions are there to create suicide bombers, child versions make the most sense for the enemy to use.",

People like you reek of hypocricy so much it's hard to understand what drives you to your \"morality\" standarts. When Israel kills a 14 year old, he is a child. Yet when a 14 year old is sent to kill, your terrorist-apologie instincts tell you he is already a man.\n \n An even more worriesome conclusion is, \"they are back to a wall. What would you do if you were them?\" Jews in the Holocaust, suffered more than the Palestinians ever did and they never streched bombs to themselves to kill innocent people, they only fought against the Nazis themselves. So do many oppressed people's around the world (you do know that there are other people suffering other the Palestinians, do you?). Targeting innocent people - no matter what circumstances - is wrong.\n \n And yes this incident was against Israeli soldiers, but I know you wrote that statement on a more general note.",

I didn't ask a question about what certain people living under 40-years of gun point oppression and death might do, that's an established fact. I stated that no one knows what anyone else is capable of under those same circumstances, including Americans.\n \n It has nothing to do with my standards of morality, or yours. We're observers of that circumstance, not participants other than supplying the money and materials Israel uses in furthering their policies, which easily determines loyalties if one supports or condemns those policies. To condemn anyone else for any act of violence using moral standards while we're killing Iraqi civilians with personal and impersonal weapons would seem to be the real height of hypocrisy. \n \n Everyone in my Jewish family still alive from the WWII era said there was little resistance involved against the Nazis due to the fact that the Gestapo and attached military units had virtually complete control over Germany's entire populace. Escape from Germany was the primary resistance, with those not escaping being quickly interned as slave labor or put to death, neither offering any opportunity for resistance. You're comparing genocide of unarmed citizens to oppression of armed citizens, not what I'd call a debatable comparison nor a reasonable platform for establishing moral standards.",
