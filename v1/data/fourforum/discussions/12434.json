Some 12.5 million people are searching for work - more than the population of the entire state of Pennsylvania.\n \n No one seems immune: The jobless rate for college graduates has hit its highest point on record, just like the rate for people lacking high school diplomas.\n \n Employers also are holding hours down and freezing or cutting pay as the recession eats into sales and profits. If part-time workers who can't find full-time jobs are counted in, along with those who have simply given up looking, the rate would be 14.8 percent, the highest in records going back to 1994.\n \n The wintertime blizzard of layoffs - nearly 2 million lost jobs in just three months - is destroying any hope for an economic turnaround this year while feeding insecurities among people who still have jobs as well as those who desperately want to find work.\n \n \"In this economy, if you have a family to feed like I do, beggars can't be choosers,\" said Greg Ovetsky, who lost his job at an information technology company two weeks ago.\n \n Ovetsky, 37, of Staten Island, N.Y., said he'll take any position. \"You can rest assured I'll say yes. Get a paycheck, get food on the table.\"\n \n Across the country, Douglas Walch, 54, worries about losing his job as a park maintenance foreman because his employer of 15 years - the city of Sacramento - is preparing for layoffs.\n \n \"It's the worst I've ever seen it in my lifetime,\" Walch said.\n \n President Barack Obama, barely a month into his own new job, acknowledged the layoffs were coming at an \"astounding\" clip but urged Americans to allow him time for his economic revival policies take root.Huge layoffs push joblessness toward double digits - NewsFlash - PennLive.com\n \n Of what value is not raising the taxes on people who never paid taxes anyway under the previous system when they wont have jobs or can't afford the prices being asked for items they want or need?",
