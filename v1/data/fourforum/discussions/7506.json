Just TRY to talk logic with some of the folks here. A large percentage of the US public believes our military has been \"gutted\". Currently our force stregth is enough to take on the next 10 largest militaries in the world or invade Europe. I guess some won't be happy until we can invade Europe AND take on the Chinese at the same time. \n \n The really ironic part about this is that we have a MASSIVE military, which we apparently need to \"defend\" ourselves, but we only have THREE military bases designated as defensive bases. The rest are all either support bases or force projection bases (meaning they blow things up overseas).\n \n The super ironic part of this is that partially due to our need to build a massive military, we have allowed our industrial infrastructure to crumble.

Most military technologies do not trasfer into the private sector, or they do in such a radically changed form that the military incarnation is useless. This is why people who join the military for training are XXXXXX...they get out to find that military systems are so different form theri civilian counterparts that their training is worthless.\n \n Ourt military is rarely on the cutting edge of anything. When hundreds of lives hang in the balance, you do not want the newest latest and greatest, you want proven technology. Most of the neat \"new\" toys the military plays with are new implementation of old technology. For example, thermal imagine (FLIR) was developed by JPL and nasa in the 60's. Commercially available FLIR systems have twice the resolution and are half the size of military units, and have half the price tagm, because the civilian units use single chip image processing while the military version, primarly a hold over of the 80's, uses a much more expensive setup. \n \n The problem with military spending is that everything porduced is a lost leader. None of the weapons systems, vehicles, etc... have any inherent value to our naiton as a whole on an economic level. We could burn the same amount of cash each year and it would have the same economic effect, plus we wouldhave the added benifit of being able to roast hot dogs.",

   "I'll comment on the last few posts...\n \n The innovation that comes from the private sector is true to some degree...remember, the private sector is what does most of the innovation for the military...it is just the military that comes up with the crazy needs to get the ball moving, for example Lockead Martin. \n \n NASA is another good example. No private sector has any use for going into space but the government doing it created challenges that led to so many new products...mainly new metals and fibers. \n \n I disagree that the military uses old technology. They might use the old technology on the field but the are innovating it now. Hovercrafts and things of the nature come to mind. Stealth techonology is another one. Insane advances in aerodynamics. Predator drone is something that they have improved on with recent techonology using unmanned vechiles to get the job done (see Boeing X-45). They also inspire new things and support programs that seek innovation. I would say NASA and other military functions do more with technology than you think.

With our weapons systems, our current fleet of fighters is still projected to be more combat effective than the next most advanced fighter in the world (the Eurofighter) by about 80%.\n \n Heres a thought. If we REALLY have to have shiny now flying toys, lets buy Eurofighters. With US propreitary weapons systems, that would ensure us air superiority for years to come, and cost about half as much. The Eurofighter is even cheaper than an F-15E\n\n \n Never underestimate the defense lobby. The new concept F45 or whatever number pentagon toy just dropped Rolls Royce from consideration as engine supplier. Less than a year after the UK purchased enough of our debt to equal 8% of their GDP. The bribes I mean lobby money for US politicians wouldn't be there if we bought the Eurofighter.",

   "Some estimates if the US cuts back on the total number produced put the unit cost at $228 million each for the F-22. Having the absolutely best air superiority fighter in an age where combat drones, cruise millises and SAM's are gaining much ground does not make much sense. \n \n Overall the next war ( ie a war vs Europe, Russia or China )where the F-22 would be of any use will see most of its bases in the combat zone reduced to craters, making it ineffectual",

As far as the british accumulation of US debt....purely selfish. They know as well as anybody that they bet on the wrong horse in this race, and at this point their fate is closely tied to the US. I would say the only question is whether they will bankrupt themselves trying to keep our leaky boat afloat in hopes that they can save themselves in the process. It seems more likely to me that they are doing the same thing and US politicians...trying the forestall the inevitable so the disaster strikes on somebody elses watch, thus preserving their own reputations for the history books.",
