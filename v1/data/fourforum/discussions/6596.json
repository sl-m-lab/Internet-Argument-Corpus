   "What follows is a collection of quotes, re: religious belief, which I've accumulated over time and which I'd like to share. It's only a partial listing, given that I didn't want to overwhelm. This forum, like many other such, seems to be dominated by discussions concerning conservative/fundamentalist Christian theology/apologetics, and I thought it might be beneficial to get off that particular treadmill for awhile. \n \n Many Paths\n \n As men approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. -- Hinduism, Bhagavad Gita 4.11\n \n My Lord, you are one although variously appearing. -- Jainism, Hemachandra \n \n We believe in God, and what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in what was given to Moses, Jesus, and the Prophets from their land. We make no distinction between any of them, and to God do we submit. -- Islam, Qur'an 3.84\n \n There are righteous men among the nations who have a share in the world to come. -- Judaism, Tosefta Sanhedrin\n \n And Peter opened his mouth and said, \"Truly I believe that God shows no partiality, but in every nation any one who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. -- Christianity, Acts 10:34-35\n \n Just as the sin-offering atones for Israel, so righteousness atones for the peoples of the world. -- Judaism, Talmud\n \n Tolerance\n \n To be attached to a certain view and to look down upon other views as inferior - this the wise men call a fetter. -- Buddhism, Sutta Nipata\n \n Like the bee, gathering honey from different flowers, the wise man accepts the essence of different scriptures and sees only the good in all religions. -- Hinduism, Srimad Bhagavatam\n \n A man has a faith. If he says \"This is my faith\", so far he maintains truth. But by that he cannot proceed to the absolute conclusion: \"This alone is truth and everything else is false\". -- Buddhism, Majjhima Nikaya\n \n Inborn Goodness\n \n Every child is born of the nature of purity and submission to God. -- Islam, Hadith\n \n God needs no pointing out to a child. -- African Traditional\n \n The great man is he who does not lose his child's heart. -- Confucianism",

I mean by evil of course, killing people other than Christians because they would not convert, bigotry against other religions, including the Roman Catholic Church, shooting doctors because they preform abortions, even though they mainly are gynocolgists..\n \n What you call heresy is someone elses heart felt belief, based on those very \n books you call infallabile.

   "\"Unbelievability\" in that it exposes the true condition of the heart. D.O.A. It's true that the Bible was written by humans, but the \"agenda\" here is that it was divinely inspired, and therefore infallable. As I've stated before, humans are made of three parts: Body, Mind and Soul. When we are born into this world, we are born with dead souls. Why? Because of Adam's disobedience, sin entered into every fabric of this world, and especially into the hearts of mankind. Now, your problem, as the Word sees it, is that you want to live in such a way that goes contrary to nature, and to the will of God. That's how everyone is prior to salvation in Christ. You want happiness, well God offers something better. Joy His plan of salvation not only rectifies the sin issue, but can give you an abundant, real life. You cannot get that on your own, nor can you get that through happiness.\n\n \n D.O.A? Dead on arrival?\n Well the fact that it was divinely inspired is debatable. There's no way to prove that. You call evolution a farce; I call the tale of Adam and Eve a farce. The sins you speak of are the things reviled by a bunch of people from thousands of years ago, a people in whose society science had little to no influence, a society where superstition ruled the day. My problems according to the word are immaterial. The word is false; it was made by humans pushing their agenda. As such, there is no credibility in the word except for faith, which in itself can be simultaneously the most convincing factor yet the most unconvincing of them all.",

   "George, let me ask you flat out. Why do you have such a hangup about the Bible?\n\n \n I can't answer for George, but my own personal hang-up with the bible comes from fundamentalist Christians trying to run society the way they think the bible says it should be. Like making it harder to get a divorce, impossible to get a legal abortion, discriminating against homosexuals, attempting to shut down important scientific research and discrediting valid scientific theories.\n \n I have no problems with the bible as a tool for personal worship. But if you, or others, want to use it as a template for society I want to see conclusive evidence that indicates that the bible being wholly true and accurate is the most likely of all possible theories and explanations.\n \n I've asked to see this evidence time and time again. The best anyone can give me is a biased christian site about a 1st century cave containing carvings that may be related to the first apostles. I can't even get the original reports from the man who discovered and studied the cave in question. Where is the evidence for Genesis? Where is the evidence for the Exodus? What about Noah's flood? The burning bush? To believe the bible is true we have to make this huge assumption that there is this old invisible man living in the sky whith all sorts of unimaginable powers. We have to make this assumption with absolutely zero supporting evidence. If someone asked you, based on the same criteria, to believe in invisible flying space monkeys, you would laugh at them. Why?

   "Bassman knows that Jesus NEVER claimed to be \"God almighty\".\n\n \n You can't speak for Bassman. And you're totally wrong on the divine claims of Jesus.\n \n Did Jesus Claim To Be God?\n \n His Identity\n by Josh McDowell\n \n Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case. Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said the he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself as Allah; and nowhere will you find Zoroaster claiming to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen Him (Jesus) has seen the Father. (John 14:9)\n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 5:17-18). Jesus claimed the ability to forgive sins (Mark 2:5-7), which the Bible teaches was something that God alone could do (Isaiah 43:25).\n \n The New Testament equated Jesus as the Creator of the Universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The Apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God.\n \n Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt of the Jewish authorities. When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a\n man, make Yourself out to be God.\" (John 10:33, NASB). This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings--not the teacher--are all important.\n \n Confucianism is a set of teachings. Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Muhammad being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder.\n \n However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching the truth; He claimed that He was\n the truth. (John 14:6) What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God?This was the claim He made for Himself.\n Suppose this very night the president of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\" He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the vice-president. Anybody who would dare to make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God.\n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all.\n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God? The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30-31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead.\n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV) In another place He said, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spake of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 2 KJV). The ability to raise His life back from was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived.\n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection.Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God. \n \n From the Josh McDowell book \"Answers to Tough Questions\", pp. 72-75.",

   "Jesus Must Be God  \n \n John 1:23 quotes Isaiah 40:3 as saying John the Baptist was to prepare the way of the LORD (Jehovah). John prepared the way before Jesus so Jesus must be LORD (Jehovah). \n \n In Isaiah 44:8 God is the only Rock. Psalm 18:31 says, \"Who is the Rock except our God\"? I Corinthians 10:4, identifies Jesus as the Rock. Jesus must also then be God the Rock. \n \n Isaiah 44:24 says that God (Jehovah) is the one who has made all things. Colossians 1:16, speaking of Christ, says that \"all things were created by Him and for him\". Jesus must therefore be Jehovah God. \n \n In Jeremiah 10:10 it says \"the LORD (Jehovah) is the true God\". I John 5:20 states that Jesus is the \"true God\". Jesus must be the true God.\n \n Isaiah 43:10,11 says that \"I, even I, am the LORD; and there is no savior besides Me. Jesus is the Savior (Matthew 1:21, Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1, etc., etc.). Jesus must be God the Savior.\n \n Jehovah knows all things (Psalm 147:5). Jesus knows \"all things.\" (John 16:30). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah alone is the only one who knows the hearts of all men. (1 Kings 8:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus knows the hearts of all men. (John 2:24-25; Rev. 2:18, 23). Jesus must be God.\n \n Jehovah is our sanctifier. (Exodus 31:13). Jesus sanctifies us (Hebrews 10:10). Only God is the sanctifier of men. Jesus must be God.\n \n Jehovah is our peace (Judges 6:23). Jesus is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is our righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6). Jesus is our righteousness. (Romans 3:21-22; 1 Corinthians 1:30). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be delivered / snatched out of His hand (Deuteronomy 32:39). Jesus is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be \"snatched\" out of His hand. (John 10:28). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's voice is \"like the roar of rushing waters\" (Ezekiel 43:2). Jesus' \"voice was like the sound of rushing waters\" (Revelation 1:15). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is present everywhere.(Proverbs 15:3; Jeremiah 23:24; I Kings 8:27); Jesus is omnipresent (John 1:48; Matthew 18:20; 28:20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's nature does not change (Malachi 3:6). Jesus' nature does not change. (Hebrews 13:8). \n \n Jehovah is the only God we are to \"serve\"(2 Kings 17:35); Jesus (identified as the Creator in Colossians 1:16-17) is to be served (Colossians 3:24). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n Jehovah the Lord is to be set apart as holy (Isaiah 8:12b-13). Jesus, as Lord, is to be set apart as holy (1 Peter 3:14b-15a).\n \n Jehovah's glory is not to be given to another (Isaiah 42:8). Jesus shares Jehovah's glory (John 17:5). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n God's name is Jehovah (or Yahweh-YHWH - Isaiah 42:8). Jesus has Jehovah's name (John 17:11; John 16:14-15). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the \"mighty God\" (Jeremiah 32:17-18; Isaiah 10:20-21). Jesus is the \"mighty God\" \n (Isaiah 9:6) who is \"Almighty\" (Revelation 1:7-8).\n \n Jehovah is \"the first and the last\" (Isaiah 44:6; 48:12). Jesus is the \"first and the last\" (Revelation 1:17-18; 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the \"Alpha and the Omega\" (Revelation 1:8; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus is the \"Alpha and the Omega\" (Revelation 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's title is \"the Holy One\" (Isaiah 47:4). Jesus is \"the Holy One\" (Acts 3:14; John 6:69). Jesus must be Jehovah, the Holy One.\n \n Jehovah is the \"stumbling stone\" of Israel (Isaiah 8:13-15). Jesus is the \"stumbling stone\" of Israel (1 Peter 2:6-8). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the great Judge who gives life to whom he wishes and who renders to each man \"according\" to his \"deeds\" (Psalm 98:9; Deuteronomy 32:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus is the only judge who gives life to whom he wishes and renders to each man \"according\" to his \"deeds\" (John 5:21-22; Revelation 2:18, 23). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n Jehovah is the great \"shepherd\" who leads his people to \"the spring of the water of life\" (Psalm 23:1-2; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus as the \"shepherd\" of His people, leads them \"to springs of the water of life\" (John 10:11-18; Revelation 7:17). THERE IS ONLY ONE SHEPHERD --John 10:16.\n \n Jehovah is \"Lord of Lords\" (Deuteronomy 10:17). Jesus is \"Lord of Lords.\" (Revelation 17:14; 19:16). The Father is Lord of all (Matthew 11:25; Acts 17:24). Jesus is \"Lord of all.\" (Acts 10:36). THERE IS ONLY ONE LORD (Jude 4) .\n \n Jehovah created the universe (Psalm 102:25-27). Jesus created the universe (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-19; Hebrews 1:10-12). THERE IS ONLY ONE CREATOR. (Isaiah 44:24).

Well, anyone who has studied the Bible knows that Jesus never claimed to be \"God Almighty\".\n \n Any Christian would never make the statement that \"What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity\". Josh McDowell is a Biblican, not a Christian. Also, note that in every verse he sites, nowhere does Jesus claim to be \"God\". Jesus never says that and never claims that. The few verses he sites as \"indicating\" that Jesus said he was God are seriously disputed mistranslations of the Greek.\n \n Why not cut and paste from a Biblical scholar who knows what he is talking about.\n \n Show me the verse where Jesus says, \"I am God, kneel down and worship me\" or stop your putting words in his mouth. \n \n You know, EZ, you claim that others are \"Christ bashing\", but putting words in Jesus' mouth can be worse than Christ bashing.",

A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case.\n \n Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said that he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen him (Jesus) has seen the Father (John 14:9).\n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 14:9). The New Testament equated Jesus as the creator of the universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16, KJV), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God.\n \n Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies as well. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt on the part of the Jewish authorities. When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God\" (John 10:33, NASB).\n \n This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings -- not the teacher -- are all-important. \n Confucianism is a set of teachings; Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Mohammed being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder. \n However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching mankind the truth; He claimed that He was the truth (John 14:6).\n \n What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God? This was the claim He made for Himself. \n Suppose this very night the President of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\"\n \n He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the Vice-President. Anybody who would dare make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God. \n \n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with Him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all.\n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God? The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30, 31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead. When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV).\n \n In another place He said, when asked for a sign, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spake of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 21, KJV). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived. \n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection. Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God.\n \n (This is an excerpt from the book, \"Answers to Tough Questions,\" by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart.) \n \n Before Abraham was, I AM!\n \n Nice try, Howard.",

   "Have some more Kool Aid with your hysteria, Howie. Then read Matthew 28:18-19.\nEZ, I was just having some fun.\n \n As far as Matthew 28:18-19, I suggest that you look at the original Greek. There is nothing there to lead one to believe that Jesus is saying that he is God or that there are three \"persons\" in one God. What he is saying is what he has said all along in the Gospels, The Father is the creator, the source and force of all that is, the Son is the created and the Greek word translated here as \"spirit\" doesn't mean a \"person\" or \"entity\", it refers to the presence of \"God\" in each human being (see Luke 17:21 \"the kingdom of God is within you.\" He was saying that God is the ocean and we are the waves. \n \n You see EZ, when Moses in Exodus asks the burning bush who's talking, the response he gets is I AM WHAT IS. We are all sons of God and sons of man, not only Jesus, otherwise what is Jesus saying when he tells us to pray to \"our Father\". If God is our father, then we are sons of God. \n \n It is not three different \"personas\" in one God; Jesus is describing the relationship of all that exists to God, in other words, he is telling us how it works. There is the power that creates (God, YHWH, the Father, whatever name you like), then there is the creation (the Son) and then there is the power of the Father that sustains the creation, the force of life that we have been given and without which we die. Just like there can be no waves without the ocean, there can be no us without God.\n \n Please don't give me a bunch of cut and paste rhetoric, think about the concept that maybe this is what Jesus is talking about.",
