   "The potentiality argument is often used against those who do not believe that a fetus is worthy of being called a person, a human, or whatever word you prefer to argue over. It basically says that, even if a fertilized egg is not a person, it is on its way to being one, and, if nature is allowed to take its natural, unimpeded course, will be a person soon enough. Because of this, the argument says that the fetus is sacred and ought to be protected as such. Often, this debate becomes dotted with examples of things like human vegetables who might come out of their coma as potential people who aren't really people, or a person who was knocked out in a brawl as a potential person who is not (on some level) currently a person, and many other examples. We often believe it is immoral to kill people in these conditions, so the potentiality argument says that a fetus is just as sacred and requires our protection.\n \n I don't know about you, but if I take a step back, and look at this big picture, with all these beings debating over whether or not these arguments can philosophically or morally hold water, I can't help but think of it as the grossest, darkest tease life can contain. Here we are, debating philosophy, which is a celebration of life and the blessings of existence, and all the while these \"would-be beings\" are getting blotted out of existence by the very dance that is our celebration.
