   "I'm sure everyone has seen the melee that occurred against the Detroit Pistons and the Indiana Pacers 1000 times already. To make a long story short, a fan threw a cup filled with beer at a basketball player, Ron Artest, who then responded by going into the stands after the fan. Needless to say, this brought more players into the stands and more fans onto the court. Artest was suspended for the rest of the season (73 games) and a few other Pacers received 20-30 games suspensions. \n \n The main problem was the players going into the stands. I am not defending what the players did, however would Ron Artest have gone into the stands if a fan wouldn't have thrown a beer and hit him in the neck? I doubt it. \n \n After the brawl erupted, many fans went onto the court and challeneged players. Some fans in the stands who weren't even involved began to fight players. And when the Pacers players left the court, every fan with a bottle, popcorn, beer, etc threw it on the players. Since the players have already received very stiff penalties, isn't it time that the fans be punished as well? The fan (who wasn't even sitting in the section he paid for) who instigated the whole thing by throwing a beer at a player and then challenging him should go to jail for at least 6 months and pay a hefty fine. The other fans who threw anything they could get their hands on should pay a small fine. And for the fans who actually came onto the court to go after players, they should serve a year and also pay a hefty fine. \n \n Purchasing a ticket does not entitle you to throw stuff at players, curse at players, or challenge them to a duel on the court. Fans need to act in a decent manner, and what happened at this game was far from decent. Hopefully the hundreds of unruly fans will be punished as well.",

Had he not thrown a beer at Artest, why would have Artest went into the stands? He simply wouldn't have and we wouldn't be talking about this. I put the blame for starting the riot on the XXXXX who threw the beer, yet I also put the players at fault for acting the way they did. But then again, they never would have been in the position had the guy been in his correct seat and shown some self-control.\n \n I seriously hope the guy who incited this riot is punished as severely as possible and does not receive any sort of compensation...heck, Artest went after the wrong guy in the first place, so if anyone should get money it should be him!! The guy who threw it actually put Artest in a bear hug when he went after the other guy! This guy must have had it in his mind that he wanted to fight someone.",

The guy he attacked first didn't throw anything, and didn't really have anything to do with it. The guy who DID throw the beer is the one you see pulling on him. He was trying to pull him OFF the WRONG GUY. Apparently (according to the beer throwers attorney) Artest was kicking Mr beer thrower, and apparently Mr beer throwers legs were bruised all to hell following the confrontation. This is why Mr beer thrower started hitting mr enraged B-ball player.\n \n They had a prosecutor on there, and a defense attorney (this si pretty standard on the Abrams Report). The prosecutor seemed to feel that the odds of Artest being charged with several counts of aggrevated battery were pretty high, and that there was a lesser chance of the beer thrower being charges with a single lesser offense. The defense attorney (I can't rememebr his name, but he has been on there several times before and has always been quick to defend accused persons) had a rather weak response, byt seemed to be of the opinion that there was not much of a defense there for artest.\n \n \n My personal take......The guy shouldn'ty have thrown the beer. It was not a good thing to do. Should he be charged? Probably not. Throwing things at an NBA game is pretty common. Maybe he should be banned for life or something from NBA games. Don't know if they can do that or not, but probably wouldn't be a bad idea if the NBA has the ability to do so.\n \n Artest acted like a jackass and should be suspended indefinatly and spend some time in jail. Sure, he got wet. If he had acted like an adult instead of jumping into the stands and attacking the wrong guy this whole thing would have been a nothing deal. I can't believe that they are trying to spin this that some drunken XXXXX who tossed a beer onto the court is just as responsible as the NBA player who vaulted into the stands and assaulted several innocent people. \n \n I can't believe people are actually arguing that the guy should be thrown in jail for throwing a beer at somebody. Maybe if it had been an unopened can, or a bottle, but we are talking about a plastic cup. There was NO possibility of injury to the other guy, despite the rediculous \"could have hit him in the eye and scratched a cornea\" argument presented here.....scratched corneas heal, and a plastic cup isn't heavy enough to do sufficient damage to an eye to cause more than fleeting discomfort.\n \n So, on the one hand you had a person who did something rude, but not dangerous, and on the other you have a professional athlete who assaults several people. You really think the blame needs to be equally divided here? Are you kidding me?",

   "Perhaps some facts are in order.\n \n The Pacers were crushing the Pistons by double-digits. Artest's 24 points and his defense was a major reason for the blow-out. He was the Pacers leading scorer that night.\n \n Ben Wallace of the Detroit Pistons got away with a foul on Artest (i.e. the refs did not call it). On other end of the floor with 45 seconds left, Ron Artest of the Indiana Pacers was called for a foul on Ben Wallace.\n \n Wallace expressed his displeasure by shoving Artest. It was a two-handed shove. Artest walked away towards the scorer's table while Wallace had to be calmed down.\n \n At this point, Artest is at the scorer's table. A man with a criminal background (let's call him convict) allegedly threw a cup filled with ice and beer at the scorers' table. Ice, if you didn't know already, is the solid form of water. Let's stop downplaying the actions of the convict by conveniently neglecting the ice that was in the cup. The convict did not simply pour beer on Artest. The convict threw ice as well.\n \n The convict was successful in hitting Artest (beer-hit). Whether that was his intention, we will probably never know. But the result was that Artest was hit. Artest reacted by going into the stands. However, he did know, at the time, who was responsible.\n \n Artest saw a fan jumping up and down, celebrating the beer-hit. Let's call this fan the cheerleader. Artest ran towards the cheerleader. The cheerleader was apparently yelling \"It wasn't me\" or something to that effect. Artest may have believed him as Artest did not throw a punch. Artest was attempting to back off but was prevented by the hostile crowd who was grabbing him.\n \n Stephen Jackson of the Pacers was rushing to the scene. One of the fans in the hostile crowd threw beer at Artest's face. Jackson attempted to express his displeasure with this second beer-thrower. \n \n The convict, noted earlier, grabbed Artest and proceeded to slug Artest in the back of the head. Artest retaliated. At this point, Artest throws his first punch. The convict lost his balance and was falling so Artest's first punch was merely a quick, downward jab. But in any case, Artest made contact with the convict who started the brawl.\n \n The convict and Artest were separated and Artest was escourted back on the court. While heading towards the bench, another fan wearing a Piston jersey (let's call him George) walked up to Artest to challenge him to a fight. Artest threw a right jab at George's jaw that connected. George appeared to be unphased by it. Artest hit him again while another fan -- assumed to be George's friend -- tackled Artest by the legs. Let's call this fan Crazy Legs.\n \n Jermaine O'Neal of the Pacers with a running head start attempted to strike Crazy Legs on the head. Foruntately for Crazy Legs, O'Neal lost his balance but did manage to connect.\n \n Through it all, nobody was seriously injured.",

Let's call this fan the cheerleader. Artest ran towards the cheerleader. The cheerleader was apparently yelling \"It wasn't me\" or something to that effect. Artest may have believed him as Artest did not throw a punch. Artest was attempting to back off but was prevented by the hostile crowd who was grabbing him.\n\n \n Thats sure not what the video looked like. Artest grabbed the guy and threw back his arm to throw a puch and was dragged off before he could deliver it.\n \n \nStephen Jackson of the Pacers was rushing to the scene. One of the fans in the hostile crowd threw beer at Artest's face. Jackson attempted to express his displeasure with this second beer-thrower. \n \n \n Yes, he saw a brawl and wanted to get into it. \n \n \nThe convict, noted earlier, grabbed Artest and proceeded to slug Artest in the back of the head. Artest retaliated. At this point, Artest throws his first punch. The convict lost his balance and was falling so Artest's first punch was merely a quick, downward jab. But in any case, Artest made contact with the convict who started the brawl.\n\n \n The beer thrower is the guy who dragged artest off the cheerleader. According to his attorney, he hit artest because he was being kicked while artest was trying to get abck to mr cheerleader. \n \n I am not seeing your point here. I don't think you have added any new information. Are you saying that the fan who threw the beer is as responsible as the guy who committed aggrevated battery?",

   "Ahh... yes, let us defend criminals with the most outlandish defense imaginable.\n \n 1. More to the point, ice or any other solid object (other than say a feather) does not have to travel at speeds of excess of 50 miles per hour (much less the beloved 100 miles per hour milestone that you cite) to hurt. Feel free to stab yourself in the eye with a spoon to see if it hurts. Forget damage. I'm not asking for any eye damage, permanent or temporary. Just prove to yourself that excessive speed is not necessary to cause pain.\n \n 2. Pain does not mean permanent or temporary injury, in case you are stupid enough to believe such a thing. Just in case.\n \n 3. Inflicting pain, much less causing actual damage, is not necessary to be guilty of assault and battery, in case you are stupid enough to believe otherwise. Again, just in case.\n \n 4. By definition, assault means the following: \n \n \n \nUnlawful threat of bodily violence or harm to somebody else, or an attempt to do such violence or harm; and have the means to carry out the threat \n \n http://peace-officers.com/content/glossary/def-assault.shtml\n \n The convict committed an assault, allegedly with the beer and continued with his fists (caught on video).\n \n 5. Amazingly, your analysis of the incident is primarily based on claims made by the convict (through his attorney). The convict's description obviously differs from others who watched the video.\n \n \n \n... He [Artest] went flying by the guy who appeared to have thrown it and terrorized another poor soul who was merely jumping up and down and celebrating the direct hit. And here's a lost point: Though Artest pushed the innocent fan, HE DID NOT STRIKE HIM.\n \n ...\n \n He tried to back off, but so many hostile fans were trying either to restrain him or attack him that he was momentarily stuck. That's why you couldn't condemn teammate Stephen Jackson for rushing to his rescue.\n \n ...\n \n Meanwhile, the fan who initially appeared to have thrown the cup at Artest (\"the convict\") had grabbed him from behind. One moment, this guy was trying to pull Artest away. The next, he was slugging Artest in the back of the head.\n \n Only then did Artest throw the ONLY PUNCH HE THREW IN THE STANDS. Only as the fan lost his balance and fell beneath Artest did he fire one quick, tentative, downward jab.\n \n ...\n \n \n\n \n http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=bayless/041124\n \n For those of you who have not actually seen the video, you can view it at ClickOnDetroit (http://www.clickondetroit.com/sports/3935695/detail.html).\n \n Just count the minutes it took for Ben Wallace to calm down. \n \n Then watch Artest run towards the cheerleader who was pushed down by Artest, not punched. It looked like Artest used his left arm to push the cheerleader down. Keep in mind that this happened in the stands and it does not take much for someone to be pushed backwards into the seats.\n \n There was another fan, arms folded, who was about three seats away watching. He showed no reaction while Artest was running towards the cheerleader until the cheerleader was pushed down. He (folded arms guy) looked like he backed away as another fan, the 1st suit fan noted below, enters the scene.\n \n Artest did not throw a single punch to this cheerleader, although he had plenty of time before any fan (the first fan to grab him was the convict) to stop him.\n \n Then watch the convict (he was the one with the white hat and blue shirt) grabbing Artest. Actually, he made a number of attempts to grab Artest from behind. Also watch another fan (he's the one with the white shirt) apparently trying to stop the convict from grabbing Artest while at the same time, a man in a suit was grabbing Artest's right arm. I'm assuming the 'suit' was a fan as well. No kicking by any of these individuals was observed.\n \n Then another fan, also wearing a suit, threw beer directly into Artest's face. The first 'suit' fan created an opening for this second suit fan when he grabbed Artest's right arm. Stephen Jackson landed a right roundhouse on this suit-wearing second beer-thrower.\n \n The convict was still trying to grab Artest. The white shirt man was still trying to stop the convict. At one point, the white shirt man and the convict were separated but the convict was still trying to get to Artest and the white shirt man gave up. This time another man, in a suit (yes, yet another individual in a suit), was now trying to grab Artest in addition to the convict. Both the convict and this suit man were behind Artest. Still, no kicking of any kind was observed by any of the three.\n \n Now #36 of the Pistons (Rasheed Wallace) was now in the stands with them. He wasn't doing any punching or grabbing but he was in the area. By this time, the convict was punching Artest in the head from behind with his right hand. And the convict got what he wanted.",

   "And naturally you people like to defend a criminal who was in violation of his parole. And why is that?\n \n The answer is simple. Artest is a millionaire and in the minds of simple-minded people who don't have millions, he has to follow certain rules that the simple-minded folks don't follow. It is called hypocrisy. The simple minds can call it \"professional\" but the reality is that it is called hypocrisy.\n \n For instance, criminal throws object (be it a feather or a paper cup) at a simple-minded person. It is expected that the simple-minded person would retaliate. Therefore, the simple-minded person did nothing wrong in the minds of other simple-minded individuals.\n \n If the same criminal would to throw the same object (again, be it a feather or a paper cup) at a rich individual, then it is expected that the rich individual would behave in a \"professional\" manner and kindly inform appropriate personnel (be it a bouncer or a security guard) of the actions of the criminal.\n \n The bias against rich people, especially if they are famous, is appalling. Famous rich folks already have to deal with you simple-minded, lunatics who can't mind your own business. You simple-minded lunatics are the very reason that papparazis even exist. Without your simple-mindedness, their pictures would not be worth much at all.\n \n But obviously rich people have to contend with more than just unwanted picture taking. They have to contend with your violent behavior as well. The criminal did more than just throw a cup. The criminal was punching Artest in the back of the head -- a fact that is conveniently ignored by simple-minded folks who thought of doing the very same thing but didn't have the balls to do it themselves.\n \n And speaking of simple minds, it is somewhat convenient of you to ignore Ben Wallace's actions after the foul and how it encouraged improper behavior of the fans that led up to brawl.",

   "And since when do they put ice in beer at ball games anyway? I don't think I have ever been to a single sporting event OF ANY KIND, EVER that put ice in their beer. So not only are you whining, your whining about something that didn't exist.\n\n \n I agree. I ahve NEVER seen ice in a beer at a sports event. I am not sure I have ever seen ice in a beer in the US. \n \n Even so, assumig there WAS ice in the beer, it is not possible for a person to impart enough energy into an ice cube floating in a liquid environment for that ice cuebe to hurt somebody. It simply can't be done. Try it if you don't believe me. Ice is, as somebody pointed out, the solid form of water. It is also expanded water, so is much lighter than water (why it floats). \n \n \n \nAwww, poor Artest, he might have had ice thrown at him, BOO ******* HOO! I'll summarize what you said on this subject about the beer thrower: \"He could have put an eye out!\" And you call yourself a sportsfan. *****.\n\n \n My thoughts exactly. the night I met my wife, I was drunk, as was she (party in college). I said something offensive and she threw her drink in my face. I did NOT beat her to a bloody pulp then claim I had been victimized because I am not a big crybaby jackass. I backed off, sobered up a little, then went back and tried again. Was more successful the second time.\n \n \nAnd naturally you people like to defend a criminal who was in violation of his parole. And why is that?\n\n \n Uh, because while his actions were childish, they were in no way dangerous.\n \n \nThe answer is simple. Artest is a millionaire and in the minds of simple-minded people who don't have millions, he has to follow certain rules that the simple-minded folks don't follow. It is called hypocrisy. The simple minds can call it \"professional\" but the reality is that it is called hypocrisy.\n\n \n I really don't care if he has millions or not. He behaved like a jackass and people were hurt becuse he couldn't behave like a grown up. This has nothign to do with being professional and certainly has nothing to do with hipocracy. The guy was an idiot. The fact hi did do it at WORK makes it worse, and he has been suspended. He is luck it wan't indefinatly. Beat the **** out of somebody at work on monday and I bet you are looking for a new job on tuesday. \n \n In any other situation, did he not have millions of dollars, he owuld have been arrested on the spot. He lost his temper and he HURT PEOPLE. He went into the stands with the intention of HURTING PEOPLE. If he got clocked intyhe head, so be it. He is lucky they didn't toss him down and beat him to a bloody pulp, which he probably deserved, since he was there for the sole purpose of doing harm to others. \n \n \nFor instance, criminal throws object (be it a feather or a paper cup) at a simple-minded person. It is expected that the simple-minded person would retaliate. Therefore, the simple-minded person did nothing wrong in the minds of other simple-minded individuals.\n\n \n Uh, no. It would not be expected for that other person to go nuts and start attacking people. It just isn't done.\n \n \nThe bias against rich people, especially if they are famous, is appalling. Famous rich folks already have to deal with you simple-minded, lunatics who can't mind your own business. You simple-minded lunatics are the very reason that papparazis even exist. Without your simple-mindedness, their pictures would not be worth much at all.\n\n \n Uhhhh, here you seem to be just rambling. Most wealthy public figures are wealthy because they ARE public figures. You take the \"public figure\" part out of it, and they would no longer be wealthy. If people didn't take an interest in guys like Artest, he would have to get a real job. \n \n \nBut obviously rich people have to contend with more than just unwanted picture taking. They have to contend with your violent behavior as well. The criminal did more than just throw a cup. The criminal was punching Artest in the back of the head -- a fact that is conveniently ignored by simple-minded folks who thought of doing the very same thing but didn't have the balls to do it themselves.\n\n \n Yes, he was. If, indeed, Aretest was kicking him, it was justified. Can't tell from the video whether he was or not. If Artest was NOT kicking him, it was still justified. The criminal was pulling him away from an innocent bystander that Aretest was attacking. If you go to rob a bank and somebody shoots you in tyhe back, nobody is going to argue that you didn't have that coming. If you attack some nerdy looking guy in the stands at a basket ball game and somebody punches you int he back of the head, it is rediculous to argue that you didn't have THAT coming. If you walk into a situation intending to do harm to people, you get what you get,\n \n \nAnd speaking of simple minds, it is somewhat convenient of you to ignore Ben Wallace's actions after the foul and how it encouraged improper behavior of the fans that led up to brawl.\n\n \n Yes, we should certinaly spread the blame around as much as possible. From a practical standpoint, the whole ting is probably really the fault of the guy who delivers the beer to the satdium, since, had he not delivered the beer there would have been none to throw. Or maybe it is the fault of the guy who puts the beer int he kegs.\n \n COME ON. Artest acted like an idiot. I hope he spends some time in jail. Maybe it will encourage him to not act like a jackass in the future (that is kind of the idea behind jail). I don't care how rich he is. If some homelss guy had charged intot he stands and attacked people after having a beer thrown on him, he would already be in jail. And you want to claim that we are simple minded and holding Artest to a higher standard because he is rich? Grow up.",
