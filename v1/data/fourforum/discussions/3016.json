   "Hi Justine:\n \n \nJustine << And which dictionary exactly is it that defines birth as a being is \"Hetero?\" \n \n \n Am I really the person to be asking about the definition of terms in this debate? Since none of my words appear in your post, then nothing in the original message is being challenged. \n \n First off, the 'hetero' part of the word is not in question. Does 'hetero' appear anywhere in the word Homosexual? Does the word 'birth' appear anywhere? No. Both words (heterosexual and homosexual) share the commonality of the word 'sex.' Both of those words share that characteristic with the word 'Asexual.' And thus, we have these three words Heterosexual, Homosexual and Asexual. One of those words is the oddball, because it contains 'sex' as part of the word, but it has absolutely nothing to do with reproduction. That was the point of providing the definition of 'sex' in the original post. If you disagree with Webster's definition, then please present your case. \n \n Now look carefully at those three words and pick out the one that does not belong. \n \n \nJustine << In your twisted mind, I'm sure it makes perfect sence. But then again, I'm sure Hitler thought he was only doing what was right. So would have Jim Jones, David Koresch and Osama Bin Ladden.\n \n \n My, my. What do these people have to do with anything related to this discussion? This is not about history or theology, but about grammar. \n \n \nJustine << Just face it, you're a religious fanatic.\n\n \n Now, now. Sticks and stones . . . I hope the moderator will look carefully at our exchange and note that my words have been mostly polite and informative, and send you the appropriate warning letter. \n \n \nJustine << You rank right up there with other psycho/socio-paths/cult leaders who murder their followers or convincen their followers to commit murder for them, all in their twisted version of the name of God.\n\n \n Does this mean that your side of the discussion is out of ammunition? Please go back and read through my post again and pick out the parts that are incorrect, and submit a thoughtful reply. \n \n \nJustine << Nope, you're not physically killing anybody, but you are murdering people's souls. That's just as dangerous. The fact that you don't hold the gun to any gay teenagers head doesn't exhonorate you from the guilt. Your message of hate is just as much to blame.\n \n \n No. We are simply discussing the pros and cons of 'gay rights' in this forum. This particular thread has been started to consider the definition of the primary terms in the debate. \n \n \nJustine << I would appreciated it very much if you just not posted here anymore. I have counceled someone already due to the damaging effects you words of hate have produced.\n\n \n You come out here with all this emotion and with personal attacks; comparing me to Jim Jones and Osama Bin Ladden? The wheels are coming off your trolley cart to the point that your posts do not respond to one sentence of my posts. No. This debate is not about me, guilt or counseling. Any damage being done is self inflicted. \n \n Debate is about the presentation of opposing views. Please go look up the term in any dictionary. We are not supposed to agree. If your side of the debate is weak to the point that damage is being done, then vacate the position! This side of the discussion is supported by the Creator, His Word, Mother Nature, God-fearing Christians, the Law of the land, Webster's dictionary and most of all . . . common sense! And you want me to stop posting? Show me a single convincing argument; just one. \n \n \nJustine << How dare you abuse your religion to murder anyone's soul? How do you sleep at night knowing you hurt people so deeply? Shame on you.\n\n \n The emotions you are now experiencing are felt by many people on the wrong side of a serious heartfelt debate. I have the advantage of being in the debate business for most of my life. But, you know what? A person experienced in debate always wins, because even when the other side is right, they show you something about yourself. The 'word of God' is the 'sword of the spirit (Eph. 6:17). Do not be amazed over the power of the Word of God.\n \n \n\"For the word of God  is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.\" Heb. 4:12. \n \n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

This was discussed on the Just Incredible thread.\n \n \nThis side of the discussion is supported by the Creator,\n\n \n Prove it is.\n \n \nHis Word,\n\n \n If the creator exists, and if the creator has a penis, and if the creator wrote that, and if the creator accepts your human interpretation of that based on human heterosexist patriarchal politics, correct. \n \n \nMother Nature,\n\n \n Prove it is here too. Mother nature doesn't stop it from occuring.\n \n \nGod-fearing Christians,\n\n \n Who cares about your fear?\n \n \nthe Law of the land,\n\n \n In terms of same-sex marriage? In most of the USA, that's true, however that can change.\n \n \nWebster's dictionary\n\n \n No.\n \n \nand most of all . . . common sense!\n\n \n Ha, more like by fear, ignorance and fallacies.\n \n \n And you want me to stop posting? Show me a single convincing argument; just one.\n\n \n How about you showing us one argument that isn't a fallacy? I can understand her frustration. Actually, I feel your posting is just exposing the stunning weakness of the anti side.\n \n \nThe emotions you are now experiencing are felt by many people on the wrong side of a serious heartfelt debate.\n\n \n No. If you were making racist comments and she were black, she would have the same emotions. If you were making anti-Jewish comments, and she were Jewish, she would have the same emotions. She happens to be a proud lesbian.\n \n \nI have the advantage of being in the debate business for most of my life.\n\n \n Really? I hope you didn't give up your day job. Unless you have a following of gullible, willfully blind sheeple and slaves, you couldn't have been very successful at it.\n \n \nBut, you know what? A person experienced in debate always wins, because even when the other side is right, they show you something about yourself. The 'word of God' is the 'sword of the spirit (Eph. 6:17). Do not be amazed over the power of the Word of God.\n\n \n I don't presuppose that your God exists. One would have to first prove your God exists to me, and only then could you go about proving this God said this or wrote that. How are you or right-wing religious leaders any more qualified than anyone else is, to say what this God no one can prove exists, would want, or what his \"word\" would be?\n \n Religion is a human construct. It must change with humans, or else it will not survive among humans. However, you always want to use the fairytale myth of hellfire and brimstone to try to keep people in line out of ignorance and fear. People are just too smart and too educated to be ruled by such fallacies as humanity advances.",
