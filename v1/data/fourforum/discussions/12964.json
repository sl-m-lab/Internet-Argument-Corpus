   "Opposition marches in Georgia keep Saakashvili on full alert. Opposition leaders spirited strong and promise that opposition will not stop its actions before Saakashvili will step down from office. In that situation Georgian president relies on new war against rebellious autonomies. By war Saakashvili hopes to unite nation and deflect people's attention away from opposition actions and global crisis devastating impact in Georgia. \n I think that old and well-tried formula of making ( when country is on the verge of civil war it's easier to bring inner violence to order) is working. There is strong likelihood that such solution was advised by Saakashvili's American friends but without Washington's interference Saakashvili will never make a next step besides preparing to war! And now world can wait for the new US' step only.",
