   "Break out the champagne? \n \n \nThe Huffington Post | Ryan Grim, Sam Stein, Lila Shapiro, & Nico Pitney First Posted: 11- 7-09\n \n In a victory for President Barack Obama, the Democratic-controlled House narrowly passed landmark health care legislation Saturday night to expand coverage to tens of millions who lack it and place tough new restrictions on the insurance industry. Republican opposition was nearly unanimous.\n \n The 220-215 vote cleared the way for the Senate to begin a long-delayed debate on the issue that has come to overshadow all others in Congress.\n A triumphant Speaker Nancy Pelosi likened the legislation to the passage of Social Security in 1935 and Medicare 30 years later. \"Oh, what a night!\" she proclaimed at the beginning of a press conference held after the vote. Obama issued a statement saying, \"I look forward to signing it into law by the end of the year.\"\n \n \"It provides coverage for 96 percent of Americans. It offers everyone, regardless of health or income, the peace of mind that comes from knowing they will have access to affordable health care when they need it,\" said Rep. John Dingell, the 83-year-old Michigan lawmaker who has introduced national health insurance in every Congress since succeeding his father in 1955.\n \n In the run-up to a final vote, conservatives from the two political parties joined forces to impose tough new restrictions on abortion coverage in insurance policies to be sold to many individuals and small groups. They prevailed on a roll call of 240-194.\n \n Ironically, that only solidified support for the legislation, clearing the way for conservative Democrats to vote for it.\n \n The legislation would require most Americans to carry insurance and provide federal subsidies to those who otherwise could not afford it. Large companies would have to offer coverage to their employees. Both consumers and companies would be slapped with penalties if they defied the government's mandates.\n \n Read more at: House Health Care Vote: Breaking Updates\n\n \n See roll call here.\n \n New York Times coverage here.\n \n Conyers and Kucinich, co-authors of H.R. 676, with dividing issues among progressives discussed in the New Developments thread, voted respectively \"Yes\" and \"No\". Giving credence to each side. Though the impressive John Dingell conveys a very different impression about the impact of the legislation than do others, for example, with Physicians For A National Health Plan. I would be interested in a discussion on their differences. Wonder if we'll hear about it in the news?\n \n Of course, the Senate passing should go through relatively easy now, with President Obama signing, as expected, by the end of this year. \n \n Interesting irony-filled twist ITO the Blue Dog's boomerang on the Republicans and how that turned out. \n \n Huffpost has a great front page photo, though their spreads change so quickly, who knows how long it will be up.\n \n Pinch me, am I dreaming?",

   "Taylor Marsh has posted the names of the Democrats who voted for the Stupak amendment (easy mneumonic).\n \n She also quotes Ezra Klein.\n \n \nBecause of the limits placed on the exchanges, most of the participants will have some form of premium credit or affordable subsidy. That means most will be ineligible for abortion coverage. The idea that people are going to go out and purchase separate \"abortion plans\" is both cruel and laughable. If this amendment passes, it will mean that virtually all women with insurance through the exchange who find themselves in the unwanted and unexpected position of needing to terminate a pregnancy will not have coverage for the procedure. Abortion coverage will not be outlawed in this country. It will simply be tiered, reserved for those rich enough to afford insurance themselves or lucky enough to receive from their employers.\n\n \n The stupak amendment will clearly have to go. Not as much a challenge doing so, in the Senate perhaps. About to be yet another controversy among progressives, as Taylor Marsh asserts this alone was enough reason for progressives to kill the bill.",

I feel kinda bad for them.\n\n \n I don't feel bad for them.\n \n \n For comparison, social security passed something like 372 to 33. Medicare 313-115. \n\n \n From what I read, I don't see that it's on par with social security or Medicare either. Though for a different set of reasons than yourself. Plus, considering the crooks that now control Congress, and the outcome for so many millions of Americans, it's quite an achievement, and for this President.\n \n \nAn all around fail job by the house.\n\n \n Well that's a ridiculous piece of bluster. I myself prefer more progressive legislation like H.R. 676. But in order for that to pass, likely there'd need to be major campaign finance reform.\n \n \nNo one has read the bill no final report by the CBO. We'll just take our huge burden and add it to the sinking ship.\n\n \n The plan is projected to reduce the deficit. As you well know. You don't care about the sinking ship. \n \n Plus, there are more economical ways to do this -- like Conyer's bill -- which you can't bring yourself to support either. All your side does is whine and complain without presenting any viable solution to the health care needs of so many of your fellow Americans.\n \n Because you could care less if people are dying every day.\n \n To wit, from November 5th:\n \n \nRepublicans are learning an unpleasant lesson this morning: The only thing worse than having no health-care reform plan is releasing a bad one, getting thrashed by CBO and making the House Democrats look good in comparison.\n \n Late last night, the Congressional Budget Office released its initial analysis of the health-care reform plan that Republican Minority Leader John Boehner offered as a substitute to the Democratic legislation. CBO begins with the baseline estimate that 17 percent of legal, non-elderly residents won't have health-care insurance in 2010. In 2019, after 10 years of the Republican plan, CBO estimates that ...17 percent of legal, non-elderly residents won't have health-care insurance. The Republican alternative will have helped 3 million people secure coverage, which is barely keeping up with population growth. Compare that to the Democratic bill, which covers 36 million more people and cuts the uninsured population to 4 percent.\n \n But maybe, you say, the Republican bill does a really good job cutting costs. According to CBO, the GOP's alternative will shave $68 billion off the deficit in the next 10 years. The Democrats, CBO says, will slice $104 billion off the deficit.\n \n The Democratic bill, in other words, covers 12 times as many people and saves $36 billion more than the Republican plan. And amazingly, the Democratic bill has already been through three committees and a merger process. It's already been shown to interest groups and advocacy organizations and industry stakeholders. It's already made its compromises with reality. It's already been through the legislative sausage grinder. And yet it saves more money and covers more people than the blank-slate alternative proposed by John Boehner and the House Republicans. The Democrats, constrained by reality, produced a far better plan than Boehner, who was constrained solely by his political imagination and legislative skill.\n \n This is a major embarrassment for the Republicans. It's one thing to keep your cards close to your chest. Republicans are in the minority, after all, and their plan stands no chance of passage. It's another to lay them out on the table and show everyone that you have no hand, and aren't even totally sure how to play the game. The Democratic plan isn't perfect, but in comparison, it's looking astonishingly good.Ezra Klein - Congressional Budget Office Thrashes Republican Health-Care Plan\n\n \n Let us know if you come up with anything better, and that the American people approve of.\n \n For now, though, looks like you've lost.

I wont expect an answer of course since I understand antonia. But the argument needed to be framed for the rational members.\n I would suggest that antonia hold off on her champagne celebration since her House bill seems to have no place to go.\n \n Health care overhaul faces stone wall in Senate\n By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR (AP) - 40 minutes ago\n WASHINGTON - The glow from a health care triumph faded quickly for President Barack Obama on Sunday as Democrats realized the bill they fought so hard to pass in the House has nowhere to go in the Senate.\n Speaking from the Rose Garden about 14 hours after the late Saturday vote, Obama urged senators to be like runners on a relay team and \"take the baton and bring this effort to the finish line on behalf of the American people.\"\n The problem is that the Senate won't run with it. The government health insurance plan included in the House bill is unacceptable to a few Democratic moderates who hold the balance of power in the Senate.\n If a government plan is part of the deal, \"as a matter of conscience, I will not allow this bill to come to a final vote,\" said Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Connecticut independent whose vote Democrats need to overcome GOP filibusters.\n \"The House bill is dead on arrival in the Senate,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said dismissively.\n Democrats did not line up to challenge him. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has yet to schedule floor debate and hinted last week that senators may not be able to finish health care this year.\n Nonetheless, the House vote provided an important lesson in how to succeed with less-than-perfect party unity, and one that Senate Democrats may be able to adapt. House Democrats overcame their own divisions and broke an impasse that threatened the bill after liberals grudgingly accepted tougher restrictions on abortion funding, as abortion opponents demanded.\n In Senate, the stumbling block is the idea of the government competing with private insurers. Liberals may have to swallow hard and accept a deal without a public plan in order to keep the legislation alive. As in the House, the compromise appears to be to the right of the political spectrum.\n Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, who voted for a version of the Senate bill in committee, has given the Democrats a possible way out. She's proposing to allow a government plan as a last resort, if after a few years premiums keep escalating and local health insurance markets remain in the grip of a few big companies. This is the \"trigger\" option.\n That approach appeals to moderates such as Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. \"If the private market fails to reform, there would be a fallback position,\" Landrieu said last week. \"It should be triggered by choice and affordability, not by political whim.\"\n Lieberman said he opposes the public plan because it could become a huge and costly entitlement program. \"I believe the debt can break America and send us into a recession that's worse than the one we're fighting our way out of today,\" he said.\n For now, Reid is trying to find the votes for a different approach: a government plan that states could opt out of.\n The Senate is not likely to jump ahead this week on health care. Reid will keep meeting with senators to see if he can work out a political formula that will give him not only the 60 votes needed to begin debate, but the 60 needed to shut off discussion and bring the bill to a final vote.\n Toward the end of the week, the Congressional Budget Office may report back with a costs and coverage estimate on Reid's bill, which he assembled from legislation passed by the Finance Committee and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. The Finance Committee version does not include a government plan.\n Reid has pledged to Obama that he will get the bill done by the end of the year and remains committed to doing that, according to a Senate leadership aide.\n Both the House and Senate bills gradually would extend coverage to nearly all Americans by providing government subsidies to help pay premiums. The measures would bar insurers' practices such as charging more to those in poor health or denying them coverage altogether.\n All Americans would be required to carry health insurance, either through an employer, a government plan or by purchasing it on their own.\n To keep down costs, the government subsidies and consumer protections don't take effect until 2013. During the three-year transition, both bills would provide $5 billion in federal dollars to help get coverage for people with medical problems who are turned down by private insurers.\n Both House and Senate would expand significantly the federal-state Medicaid health program for low-income people.\n The Associated Press: Health care overhaul faces stone wall in Senate",

As more and more people are subject to the fines or the dollar get inflated than at some point it is cheaper for people to go to the public option and have employers pay the fine.

   "Let me do you a solid and answer the questions for you. Keep in mind I'm not very good at thinking like a complete tool so the answers might have more logic than what you are used to seeing from these folks. \n \n It is a natural right that all Americans (not people) have health care! The constitution protects everything that I think is a natural right so therefore the constitution protects this! \n \n NONONONONONO You are the lying liar who lies about the lies spread by the evil huge health insurance companies with their industry low profit margins and high costs of about 7% of each dollar spent on health care meaning if you got rid of them you'd save about 100-150 bucks assuming Medicare was more efficient...out of a total bill of $5500-6000+ easy.\n http://9.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kqgnvaDWK31qz7j9go1_400.jpg\n http://coburn.senate.gov/oversight/?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=4fd7e7b5-4ed8-4806-87c2-951a37c2af76\n \n Better hope you don't have Medicare advantage because that sucker is gone. Plus, if you were smart you'd know that many are going to Medicaid which is partly paid for by the states. Silly republicans don't know that the states don't have to pay for it...until a few years down the road...shh, don't tell the states that. So what if Medicaid is bankrupting most states? And those annoying old people should stop crying about medicare advantage. It was too good of a deal anyway! Better get back to work grandma or you won't have dental...you lazy piece of...moving on!\n \n More of your lies! So what if the CBO said the public option would be MORE expensive than the private industry. More reform will be done and the public option will grow to more than 6 million of the sickest people. How you dirty republicans might ask? Well, most everything in this bill is not indexed to inflation. As more and more people are subject to the fines or the dollar get inflated than at some point it is cheaper for people to go to the public option and have employers pay the fine. Either that or you just reform it so it is cheaper, more people foolishly go to it, the government realizes it can't pay for the new single-payer system, the trap door opens and everyone pays an extremely high rate.\n \n The government isn't forcing you to do something, they are only punishing you if you don't do something. Geesh, see the difference? It is the same as the government not forcing you not to steal, they just punish you if you do it.\n \n In serious mode for a second, it does take a long time to implement a plan like this so 2012 would be unlikely in my book. I'd guess 2012+ two or three years of sorting out HUGE problems before you could have anything. *end serious mode*\n \n It isn't like there is anything else MORE important going on. Do you realize 6 gagillion people die every second because the heath insurance companies deny people just like Medicare does but at a lower or equal rate? You evil republicans make it seem like employment is at 10.2% and our economy is in the tank and we are running huge deficits that we can't sustain causing the dollar to devalue and companies to seek investment elsewhere. Get real!\n \n I can't answer this but I will say that you shouldn't question the integrity of someone who has been banned from this forum 2 or 3 times, values getting arrested, and thinks people support single-payer when it fact most do not. It is insulting for you to think she is brain-dead and I am deeply offended and feel you should apologize right now.\n\n \n Good answers; it appears antonia and simone agree with you since they didn't see fit to correct or revise anything you have said.
