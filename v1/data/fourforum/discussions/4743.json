They also tend to claim that condemnation of homosexuality is repeated in the New Testament, but the references are weak and interpretive. Many quote references to Sodom, but Sodom was destroyed for its oppression of the lower class. Many quote references to promiscuity, which of course has nothing to do with homosexuality.\n \n I may be missing some argument here; this is based on what I know of the Bible.

How many would lie to save a life? How common is it for a husband to tell his wife she looks good, even when she doesn't? I don't mean you agree with these things, just that a lot of people do.\n \n \nI think the reason people (mostly gay rights people) are investigating the reasons the Bible condemns it is that they want to do the very thing it condemns, pure and simple. I don't think they approached it from the standpoint of \"finding out,\" but rather looking for reasons they can say it's ok, even at the expense of standard interpretation.\n\n \n I'd agree that they want to justify the thing that it condemns (though maybe or maybe not do it themselves). They probably don't always approach it from the stance of \"finding out\", certainly Locke in my example didn't, but that doesn't mean that we should assume they are lying about their discoveries and never question the original interpretation. Remember, those that hold onto the original interpretation are often in the mindset of trying to prove that the action is wrong; they are no less biased than the people looking at the Biblical interpretation.\n \n \nYou sure have a knack for portraying opinion as imposition. We aren't even talking about \"civil rights\" in this thread, we are talking about Gene Robinson's insistence on going against church doctrine, even at the risk of tearing the church apart. His \"civil rights\" aren't being violated--he can still worship as he chooses. No one here is advocating a law against him being able to do that.\n\n \n Well, I'm guessing he was indeed referring to your stance on marriage. I don't really think it is too inappropriate to make a reference back to that. We are talking about interpretations of the Bible, and he was referring to how people use those interpretations to justify denying people rights.",

   "If you read and really study Biblical interpretation and methods for any length of time, you find out real quick that it's pretty common for some people to use the \"mistranslated\" argument to make the scriptures say what they want them to say, especially when there are political and ideological motives as in the case of gay lobby groups. Besides, to throw out traditional interpretation just because it's politically advantageous to do so seems pretty desperate to me. \n\n \n If it can be shown through reputable scholarship that a particular passage in the bible was mistranslated, how could you NOT want to know that? You would prefer the adulterated \"Word of God\" just for tradition's sake? Even more appalling is relying on a recent \"modernized\" translation. Frankly, I've always thought it odd that \"true believers\" would even touch a bible in contemporary English.\n \n \nIt seems to me it would be better to simply disagree with the Bible and accept that there is a disagreement than to try to reinterpret it and convince everyone that a sudden new reinterpretation (at least in the sense of this century--mostly the last 3 decades) is better than thousands of years of interpreting it the other way. \n\n \n Modern day biblical scholarship is a vast improvement over the studies of the previous several hundred years. Any review of history shows that the translation process was rife with errors and impure motives, many based on political goals of the times. At least today, there is a world-wide, rigorous field of study.\n \n That said, though I find the ideas about misrepresentations of scripture interesting and worthy of real analysis, I don't expect any major revision. I find it entirely plausible, indeed likely that the writers of Leviticus and other books were just as bigoted against gay people as their modern-day counterparts. For them to be incapable of differentiating temple prostitution from same-sex love does not surprise me. For them to condemn a cultural practice of their arch enemies does not surprise me. Goodness knows, \"god's chosen people\" didn't like a whole lot of what the majority of the world was up to. (There's a recent Frontline episode on extremist Jewish settlers in the West Bank. In one scene, one of the leaders rants about \"the Hellenists\" that defile Israel -- something like that. These hatreds go back millennia -- we just got stuck in the middle.)\n \n \nAnd since the reinterpretation comes up in times of a political and ideological push to make homosexual sex as acceptable as apple pie (really an outgrowth of the 60s sexual revolution), it comes across as pretty suspect.\n\n \n It has been shown to you over and over that the movement predates the \"sexual revolution\" of the 60s by about 80 years. I can only assume that sheer dishonesty and immorality lie behind your continuing misrepresentation of the roots of the gay rights movement.",

Why do you have such an aversion to any moral principles in parenting?\n \n \nDo you expose them to other religious beliefs? \n\n \n Nope, as of now. Maybe some down the road.\n \n \nDo you teach them to keep an open mind and search for themselves? \n\n \n Certainly, but that doesn't mean there can't be some basics that can be taught to them.\n \n \nWhat would you say to them when and if they came home from school after being exposed to the theory of evolution?\n\n \n I'm a theistic evolutionist myself, so why would I have a problem with that?",
