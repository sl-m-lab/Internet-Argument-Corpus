If the true God and only creator can be tested and tryed and remain true, we had better acknowledge Him and submit ourselves as living sacrifices. There is no god or religion that can come out on top of scrutiny other than Jesus Christ and the Trinity. Let us examine His truth, and his creation, and acknowledge the source.",
