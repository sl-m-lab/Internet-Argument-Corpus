   "OK. It looks like the Baltimore Ravens are next in line to be severely punished by DAAA BEARZZZ.\n \n BEARZZZ running back Thomas Jones's knee is still a little banged up this week but, like a real man, he took a pre-game pain shot and played last week. Rumor has it that rookie RB Benson is not the sharpest tool in the shed and is having a hard time with the playbook. Luckily, I have e-mailed a plan to coach Lovie Dovie for young Benson. Kyle Orton is to handoff the ball normally to Cedric Benson, then scream at the top of his lungs \"STOP!! POLICE!!\" That should help motivate Mr. -first round draftpick- Benson to run like his million dollar contract depended on it.\n \n Oh, and thank the lord rookie QB Orton finally figured out that it is within the rules of the game for him to throw the football to the tightend! I'll bet he was wondering why in the hell one of his blockers kept running downfield on pass plays.\n \n \n Another quick observation on the upcoming game;\n \n The Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis is a common street thug and probably carries a loaded handgun in the waistband of his football pants -- I clued Lovie in on this as well in my e-mail. Eurlacher is a FAR better linebacker overall.\n \n Anyhoo, my prediction this week is DAA BEARZZZ 52 -- ravens -10.\n \n If DAA former COACH, DIKKAA is forced into battle becuase all the BEARZZZ players get injured --\n \n BEARZZZ 134 -- ravens 3.",
