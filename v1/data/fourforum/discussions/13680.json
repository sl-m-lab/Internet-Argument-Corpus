   "At the risk of psychologising someone who I have no knowledge of apart from what is posted in this thread, it looks like a fairly typical case of Fundamental attribution error - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n \n There is a well documented tendency for people to attribute things they feel bad about to external forces. In this case that would be demonic influence, but could equally well be bad parenting, a breakup with a girlfriend, etc.\n \n A parallel example, the well known Alcoholics Anonymous program is attributed by many former or recovering alcoholics with turning their life around; there would apparently be no denying they were instrumental. But when we try to test the effectiveness of the program, people who go through the process are no more successful in kicking the habit than those who don't follow any method at all. Yet Alcoholics Anonymous continues to be extremely popular, despite its general uselessness, because it is very easy to convince people that their addiction is not something they have influence over.\n \n It seems equally plausible to me that he would have given up his habits anyway and the pretty unconvincing image of a demon, that really looks 100% like an average dog, was merely a convenient conscious or unconscious excuse that helped to explain away his socially unacceptable behaviour.\n \n For all I know maybe in this individual instance it did turn him around, but I'm not convinced without some kind of controlled study (which would be almost impossible to conduct and would probably violate about 10 ethical rules of human experimentation) that this kind of photo would positively influence the average person.\n \n And tell you what, for someone to be a drug addict and attending an anniversary reception of all things, looking respectable in a tuxedo, he's already apparently in a lifestyle much easier to give up on drugs in than 99% of addicts.",

In fact, I believe that you exist as a flesh and blood human being and that you are currently sitting at a computer and writing responses to me. But your argument is that I don't have sufficient evidence to prove that the photo changed his life because you refuse to accept the evidence in the article. Yet you've made it clear that your thoughts on the matter are not ambiguous. Ambiguous thoughts are the only way you can make it reasonable for you to deny evidence presented.

You're not convinced because you don't believe that the photo changed this guy's life, and you are trying to put into question the possibility of it being a life-changer rather than just coming out and saying that it isn't. Just calling this guy a liar would be a rather hard position to defend, I imagine. In this case, \"maybe that's wrong\" is easier to defend than \"that's wrong\".",
