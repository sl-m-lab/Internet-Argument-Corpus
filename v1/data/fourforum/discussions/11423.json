   "Now they are going to sue because the wording was changed to reflect what the measure will do. They are now running scared. I thought they were the bringers of truth to the people of Gods world? So why are they upset about truth of their actions and what the law will actully do?\n The wording now relects the the result if the voters pass this initiative. The right of same sex couples to marry will be eliminated. I thought that was thier whole aim? They want to keep gay people from being able to marry and gay people can now marry so it will be taking rights away if passed. Why is the truth so scarry for them? The artical even says this is not the first time title wording is changed before a proposal has gone on the ballot. \n \n http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-gaymarriage29-2008jul29,0,3163072.story",

The lack of realism is astounding.\n They want to repeat their propagandic claims with their heads in the clouds, refusing to acknowledge how things REALLY affect the world.",

Incredibly, these ballot initiatives are always worded in such a way that one must read them multiple times to interpret how to vote for it. And many times people don't do that and misinterpret what it is saying, and they inadvertently vote for a measure they were against, or vice versa. The beauty of this wording is that it is totally unambiguous. However this vote turns out, you can be sure the question was understood by the people, and they voted their consciences. I say, trust the people with a clear, simple choice and let the cards fall where they may. That is how democracy should work after all. And with such clear wording so all those senior citizens aren't confused, with them being the majority segment of the voting population, along with the traditionalists and the christians, I'll bet same sex marriage is soundly defeated in Cali. But what a moral barometer of the American peoples value system this social experiment will be.",
