   "It seems to me that the President, Nancy Pilosi, and Harry Reid have built the gallows and are now asking the Democrats in congress to stick their collective heads in the noose?emoticon_rolleyes Or am I wrong about this...;)\n\n \n You're spot on. Because this is such a quagmyre, here's how the HR may approach the vote:\n \n \n\n Though it is expected that the House will use the \"deem and pass\" rule to pass both the reconciliation bill and the Senate's health bill at the same time, the House Rules Committee still has to formally decide how the full vote or votes will proceed:\n \n Option 1: The House votes on the original Senate bill and then votes on the reconciliation bill separately.\n \n Option 2: The House would \"deem\" the original Senate bill passed after the House votes on the rule for debate. In other words, the House could pass the original Senate bill without lawmakers actually taking a stand-alone vote on the question. They would only have to pass the reconciliation measure.\n Health Care Day-by-Day \n\n \n Option #2 is ther cowardly approach that would, Democrats think, insulate them from the fallout of having voted FOR this unpopular bill. In reality, I hope any vote they take sits in their craw like ground glass, waiting until the people are heard in November.",
