   "I'm probably beating a dead horse here but hey, I'm bored... \n \n My question is..\n \n Why is it that Christians here in America insist that this Country was Founded as a Christian Nation upon God. \n \n History has supplied evidence to the Contrary yet Christians, especially the Religious Right insist that we were founded on Religion. The Constitution doesn't make Mention of God, Jesus, or any hint of Religion. I realize that many early Americans were religious, but the Founders recognized ALL religion and not just Christianity. \n \n John Adams was quoted as saying..\n \"This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it.\"\n \n He also wrote in the Treaty of Tripoli Specifically stating that this Country was not Founded as a Christian Nation. Is it simply too much to bear for a christian to think that this nation is not God's nation?... \n Article 11 from the treaty.\n \n \nArt. 11. As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\n \n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/treaty_tripoli.html\n That doesn't sound like he is inviting \"God\" to Found a Nation.\n \n In fact this \" Nation\" was stolen. The Early Americans were slave traders, committed Genocide against the Native Americans, and pretty much took what they wanted . How does this add up to a Nation Founded on God?...\n \n Here's a few links to the History.. So let's hear what you have to say to try to re-write history.. \n \n The U.S. NOT founded upon Christianity\n Our Founding Fathers Were NOT Christians",

   " John Adams was quoted as saying..\n \"This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it.\"\n\n \n Here's part of what John Adams said:\n \n The general principles on which the fathers achieved independence were the general principles of Christianity. I will avow that I then believed, and now believe, that those general principles of Christianity are as eternal and immutable as the existence and attributes of God.1 \n \n The Holy Ghost carries on the whole Christian system in this earth. Not a baptism, not a marriage, not a sacrament can be administered but by the Holy Ghost. . . . There is no authority, civil or religious &#8211; there can be no legitimate government but what is administered by this Holy Ghost. There can be no salvation without it. All without it is rebellion and perdition, or in more orthodox words damnation.2 \n \n Without religion, this world would be something not fit to be mentioned in polite company: I mean hell.3 \n \n The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity.4 \n \n Suppose a nation in some distant region should take the Bible for their only law book and every member should regulate his conduct by the precepts there exhibited. . . . What a Eutopia &#8211; what a Paradise would this region be!5 \n \n I have examined all religions, and the result is that the Bible is the best book in the world.6 \n \n http://www.wallbuilders.com/LIBissuesArticles.asp?id=8755\n \n \n\n He also wrote in the Treaty of Tripoli Specifically stating that this Country was not Founded as a Christian Nation. \n\n \n Still another foible where you go down in flames:\n \n Article 11 (which is disputed, by the way) merely says that the government of America is not founded on the Christian religion, as in a theocracy. This does not mean that the majority of Americans were not of the Christian faith, and it certainly doesn't address the numerous Judeo-Christian principles upon which our country was founded. In those respects, it falls short in describing America.\n \n You're busted.",

The Word religion is only used a couple of times in the context of NOT establishing any Law to recognize a Religion.

Most of this comes from the Encyclopedia, it's a matter of American History ..\n \n One of the most common statements from the \"Religious Right\" is that they want this country to \"return to the Christian principles on which it was founded\". However, a little research into American history will show that this statement is a lie. The men responsible for building the foundation of the United States had little use for Christianity, and many were strongly opposed to it. They were men of The Enlightenment, not men of Christianity. They were Deists who did not believe the bible was true.\n Read the rest here...\n \n Our Founding Fathers Were NOT Christians\n \n \n\n God is mentioned far too many times to suggest that our Founding Fathers believed that we were abandoned and left to our own devices like a thrown away litter of kittens. God is mentioned on our money and has been for a long time. The Pledge of Allegiance specifically mentions God.\n\n \n Uh no.. God is not mentioned one single time in the Constitution. The Declaration of Independence did not establish any Law or Government Policy for the Nation, it was merely a Declaration sent to The King of England to let him know we were declaring Independence. It has nothing to do with establishing the Basis for which this country was founded. \n \n And \" In God We Trust \" was added During the Civil War After The Religious Right had established themselves within our Government. This has nothing to do with the actual intentions of our Founding Fathers\" \n The Motto wasn't adopted by Law until 1956.. So once again nothing to do with Founders. The Founding Fathers Intentions were to Keep Religion Out of Government. \n \n https://ustreas.gov/education/fact-sheets/currency/in-god-we-trust.shtml\n \n \n \n\n You talk about slave trading and the Indian wars like they're proof that America isn't a Christian nation.

After all what about the Crusades in the name of Jerusalem?\n\n \n Exactly the reason that ALL ORGANIZED religion is an abomination to human societies. Christians are perhaps the Worst In my Opinion, being that they tend to pick and choose what parts of their religion to follow . \n \n I hate to burst anyone's bubble but George Washington was NOT a christian, He Like Most of our Founders Conformed to Deist beliefs and were known as Free Masons.\n \n \n Historian Barry Schwartz writes: \"George Washington's practice of Christianity was limited and superficial because he was not himself a Christian... He repeatedly declined the church's sacraments. Never did he take communion, and when his wife, Martha, did, he waited for her outside the sanctuary... Even on his deathbed, Washington asked for no ritual, uttered no prayer to Christ, and expressed no wish to be attended by His representative.\" [New York Press, 1987, pp. 174-175]\n\n \n Our Founding Fathers Were NOT Christians\n \n Believe what you like but History is History and cannot be changed. I don't expect you or any religious person to believe anything, you probably won't even bother to read the information anyway because per usual Christians won't believe anything that shows their religion for the abomination that it is even if it's the truth.",

   "Washington's religion has long been debated, but it is known (according to his journals) that he attended Christian church services (around 15 times a year). It seems from further reading that there are conflicting accounts on things like communion, but he was pretty quiet about his religion in general. \n \n I'm sure it would mean a lot to a Christian to be able to claim him as one of their own, but in my opinion any definite statements about him being a devout Christian (or even a Deist) are really hard to prove. Either way, it doesn't change the fact that this country wasn't founded on the principles of Christianity or any other religion.

Saying that one believes in a deity or admires the moral teachings of Jesus is not the same as being a Christian. Such belief and admiration is quite compatible with rejecting organized Christianity in particular and organized religion in general, at both the personal and political levels. And many of the Founding Fathers, including the more famous among them like Franklin and Jefferson and Washington, clearly rejected organized religion in this way. It is either wilful ignorance or flagrant dishonesty to claim otherwise.",

As the Word of God says in Romans 1:\n \n 26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. \n \n 28 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. 29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31 they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. 32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. \n \n So it's no wonder you try to revise history and seek to trash the Bible.

I can't express with any more clarity my understanding that people of the period were very religious, your continued insistence to point this out is asinine. Do you doubt they were and so repeat the same meaningless quotes to bolster your own insecurities?\n \n The question you continue to ignore is very simple. As devoutly religious and God fearing as you make them why is religion specifically prohibited from having a voice within the process of government. It is relegated to the personal discretion of the individual and not granted anything more than to exist as a right to enjoyed conditioned that it may not infringe on the liberties of others. It is granted no specific representation, it is guaranteed no specific protection greater than provided for other freedoms, in fact less than some.\n \n \n \nWise up.\n\n \n As people age and become ever more aware of their own mortality they look to find some type of peace with death. The inevitable conclusion to the most basic and strongest instinct man possess the need to survive. From his first gasp of air until his last he is programmed to strive for one more and religion serves to provide some sense to this irony.\n \n I leave you with this insight from your hero of religion. Many who have professed less have earned damnation in your eyes. Will you continue to hold him up as the paragon of Christian principals after you learn his last thoughts?\n Do not doubt he was a very religious man, but his view of religion is very far away from yours.\n \n \n \"Proposed New Version of the Bible\" 1779?, 935: modernize the Bible's language. Franklin puts up a tolerable sample, though agrees (as do I) that someone better than he is required.\n \n \n Letter to Ezra Stiles 1790, p. 1178: Franklin coming clean on his religious beliefs. One God, who governs the world \"by his Providence.\" Etc. etc., see my paper. Immortality of the soul. Doubts his own theologizing, but also doubts the divinity of Jesus, though he grants the goodness of the moral teaching. But believing in Jesus' divinity is good at least as it makes \"his Doctrines more respected and better observed.\" God gives good things to the believers and unbelievers alike.

The existence of religion in America and its prevalance in shaping our society is not in question. Religion's place in public policy is.\n\n \n If that's true (and in my experience it's not nearly as prevalent as critics assert), it's a separate issue that what gets written in textbooks regarding history.\n \n \nThe founding of this country was not based on Christianity, the 10 Commandments, or any other religious beliefs. While many citizens may have held religious beliefs closely, it wasn't the basis in forming our government. \n\n \n Of course not. I didn't say it was based on any of those.

They made that clear in their writings. \n \n \nI understand that the textbooks will still mention Thomas Jefferson, but they do try to downplay his part. \n\n \n As they should, because he is over-played IMO. That was the point I was making. The reason secularists like him so much (he's trumpeted by secularists a lot more than the other founding fathers) is because he himself wasn't religious. Jefferson was not the be-all and end-all of the founding of the U.S.\n \n \nThe main problem is that the school board removed his role in the enlightenment, and instead of teaching students about his writings and political philosophies, they replaced him with Saint Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, and Sir William Blackstone (not really a religious figure, but these are the 3 new names displacing Jefferson).\n \n \n I think the school board has a point. The enlightenment wouldn't have happened if not for the likes of John Calvin, for instance. (Historians generally attribute the protestant reformation one of the key catalysts of the enlightenment.) Remember, the enlightenment pre-dated Jefferson. He was a product of the enlightenment, not a cause. \n \n \nJefferson isn't the only problem. They downplay the concept separation of church and state (basically questioning whether it was really the founders' intention to separate the two.)\n\n \n Clearly the founders didn't mean the two to be so sanitized from each other as is the current trend. The most basic reading of the 1st amendment makes that clear. \n \n \nThey replaced the term 'capitalism' with 'free enterprise' (because capitalism is apparently a liberal term) and removed any references to our government using the word 'democratic' have been replaced with 'constitutional republic.' Also any 'democratic' governments have been changed to 'representative.'\n\n \n Yes, that is because 'capitalism' has indeed become a negative word due to it's use by liberals who don't like that system. The word doesn't denote freedom enough. I agree with the school board that 'free market' or 'free enterprise' is a better term.",

   "I agree. Textbooks should not disclude the benefits society has gained via religion.

   "Cop arrests preacher for saying homosexuality a sin\n \n Telling a street preacher that it is against the law to affirm the Bible's teaching on homosexuality is costing a team of British police officers some $11,000 - plus legal fees. \n \n He was preaching from the Bible in Workington town center and his sermon contained no mention of homosexuality. But when he finished, Sam Adams, who identified himself as an \"LBGT Liaison Officer,\" approached him, the institute reported. \n \n \"Even though Mr. Mcalpine had never mentioned homosexuality, [Officer] Adams warned him that he could be arrested if he made homophobic remarks. Mr. Mcalpine replied that he was not homophobic, but he sometimes preaches that homosexual conduct is a sin because that is what the Bible says,\" the report said. \n \n On Dec. 8, a court in Birmingham County concluded police in West Midlands broke the law when they arrested, handcuffed and detained street preacher Anthony Rollins. \n \n The court awarded Rollins 4,250 British pounds and ordered police to pay his legal costs. In the case of Mcalpine, police were told to pay him 7,000 pounds, or about $11,000, plus his legal fees. \n \n The U.K.'s Public Order Act includes language that is similar to Barack Obama's \"hate crimes\" law in the U.S. that he signed more than a year ago in that they ban some statements regarding homosexuality. \n \n Cop arrests preacher for saying homosexuality a sin\n \n A facist, spiritually-challenged LBGT Liaison Officer!\n \n Seig Heil.

My guess will be because God said they are commiting a sin and something creative about Islam even though in truth there is no difference from a legal perspective.\n \n Also when someone is accused of a crime, what happens?
