I would wager that we could pull every christian out of the ME and in time, the terrorists would be right back at it demanding the next thing on the list. Very few people in the ME hate Americans, very few want to ban christians from the ME, very few are willing to kill Americans for goals that they themselves do not support. It is not the ME that is fighting for this...it is a small proportion of well funded, well connected, well trained, and highly motivated people who have rallied around extremist leaders who falsely claim that a Gihad against Christians (Americans especially) is the will of god and their responsibility. Isolationism and appeasement of terrorist states only tells them that their tactics will yield results, affirming their belief that terrorism is the way to affect political change. Just look at Spain for an example. Blow up a few trains, and suddenly Spain wants nothing to do with a war against terrorism. And terrorism is still \"bad\" right? Thinking that Spain is out of danger by simply backing out of Iraq and condeming the actions of the US is misguided in the least. The terrorists will be back on Spanish soil as soon as they need something else to go their way. The same as they will with any other nation who gives in to their tactics. Give a dog a bone to keep it from biting you, and it will go away and chew on it. As soon as it is gone, the dog will be back for another bone, and if you don't hand it over right away, you get bit again. I say kill the mean dog, save the bones for dogs that ask nicely.",

Seems to me, if the immigrants from those other countries want to improve their lives, the countries they come from will remain in squalor-all the most successful and most educated will be HERE instead of THERE where they are needed most so that their countries can become more stable and productive without the aid of other countries.\n\n \n My first thought upon reading this \"disturbing\" fact was: so what? I believe the premise of our wonderful democracy is that the majority should rule, with minority rights. That doesn't change regardless of which race is in power. As a race (indeed, as humans) whites don't have any inherent political right to domination. We only have the natural rights afforded to everyone, ones which I believe are adequately enshrined in the constitution and should be protected.\n As for immigrants coming here, I'm all for it. I think it makes America stronger, not weaker, to have people with the drive and ambition to risk life and limb in pursuit of a better life. Hey, it worked for the past 200 years. If anything, we need more liberalization of immigration laws.\n \n And as for our war on terror, well, the dispute is primarily in terms of methodology, not in terms of moral justification. No liberal seriously claims we don't have the right (and i'd say duty) to go after terrorism (arabic or otherwise). What us liberals do is question the methodologies, both on moral and pragmatic grounds.\n So, if our dear conservative friends will indulge me for a moment, I'd like to critique the current administration's policies on the war on terror.\n In a global war on terror, multilateralism is a far superior option than unilateralism. Because the war on terror necessarily transcends national borders, the old rules that make unilateral action permissible tend to disappear. Unlike a classic war, the war on terror often has targets in nation's that do not in anyway support terror, but are unable to control terrorist actions within their own nation. Terrorist groups are transnational organization, and the mere prescence of them within a country does not necessarily make that county complecent (the Bush admins constant reminder that we may have Al Qaeda sleeper cells does not make the US a terrorist nation). However, it does mean that their has to be, to some degree, a respect for the role other nations play and must play for the war to succeed. This is especially clear considering the terrorists aren't just targeting us. Spain, Indonesia, India, and Israel among others have all faced terrorist threats (Israel to a far higher degree than us), and every democratic nation is threatened by the fundamentalist ideology of the terrorists. Thus, since every nation shares the harms, every nation must play a role in defeating the harms, but that REQUIRES consultation.\n The impact is twofold\n 1) Consultation yields cooperation, which is essential. We'd never have been able to accompolish what we have thus far without foreign aid. Whether its British airbases, Israeli intelligence, or Pakisitani assistance in Afghanistan, US action has depended heavily on the help of others. And yet, without consultation, we see that help withering away. Turkey refused to assist us on Iraq, as we wrongfully tried to fiat their help and paid the price. Lack of international troops has stretched US military power to the breaking point, we are woefully undermanned in Afghanistan and losing our grip on Iraq. Pro-US governments are losing ground, anti-US sentiment is on the rise, and it seems that more and more countries will follow Spain's route and withdraw assistance at the first oppurtunity. This cannot happen if we expect longterm success.\n 2) Mulitilateralism represents the best defense against charges of imperialist intent. Right now, the arab world sees us not as liberaters, but as hegemonic occupiers, and it isn't hard to see why. The US has steamrollered over international institutions which WE HELPED CREATE (and whose violation was a pretext for our war in the first place) to go into Iraq. Once their, our reconstruction effort has been marred by destablization and the rejection of Iraqi calls for immediate referendums. Iraqis are quite keenly aware that while looting was running rampant through Baghdad, US troops seized and defended the Ministry of Oil first. My point is not to question US motives (I don't think this was a war for oil, though I do think we were misled on WMDs) but rather to call out what it APPEARS like. So long as we act alone, we are vulnerable to charges that we are acting in our own interest and not in the global interest. \n The other major problem is with our focus on Iraq. This should have been worthy of suspicion at the outset, and now has been proven emprically false. I give kudos to Sen. Bob Graham and others like him who opposed the Iraqi war not b/c of Kucinich like peacenikism, but rather because so long as we don't have Osama, going after what was at best a secondary target on the war on terror could only distract us from the real deal. And what do you know? The result of the Iraq war was a swell in support for Al Qaeda, Osama still on the loose, far too few troops to stabilize Afghanistan, and the resurgence of the Taliban. In his last budget, President Bush FORGET to include any money for reconstructing Afghanistan (oops). Aside from the message it sends to the Afghans, it also is telling of what Iraq did to us: distracted us. Meanwhile, the other emerging threat to the US (and one far more dangerous than Iraq), North Korea, was allowed relative free reign during this time. Our war in Iraq perhaps more than anything else will damage our ability to defuse the Korean crisis. Why? Because the message the North Koreans got was that while oppressive regimes without nukes (Serbia, Iraq, Afghanistan) are vulnerable to US military intervention, those with nukes (NK, China) only get some harsh rhetoric every once in awhile. So long as the N.Koreans see the maintainance of a nuclear arsenal as the only possible check against US invasion, we'll never get them to disarm and never resolve the situation.",

In the PAST, they considered themselves AMERICANS first, NOW we have all this hyphenated **** going around (thanks again, Liberals)\n\n \n This is almost laughably inaccurate. Let's start from the top. I defy you to name one thing the Congressional Black Caucus has proposed that is, from both a liberal and conservative perspective, \"bad\" for white americans. I say to both liberals and conservatives because the CBC is a liberal organization, so its unsurprising that conservatives would disagree with them mostly. But for the most part, I don't have a disagreement with their advocacies (and yes I'm white).\n Next is your flawed assumption that immigrants today are assimillating less readily than immigrants of the past. This is spectacularly egocentric. EVERY GENERATION has accused its influx of immigrants as being the \"bad apples\" while praising the previous generations of immigrants. German immigrants prior to the turn of the 20th century established almost entirely homogenous communities that had german schools, german churches, and german social halls. The great wave of immigration we had in the early 1900s established dozens of \"littles,\" little italy, chinatown, etc. that are every bit as ethnic and isolated as the innercity ghettos and barios we have today. And then just as now, we had anti-immigration zealots spreading hate. The \"know-nothing party\" of the pre-civil war era raved about the spread of catholicism on our previously \"homogenous\" protestant culture. Quotas in the 1920s sought to cut off the amount of immigration from southeast europe and russia in favor of nordic countries and england. And of course their loyalty was questioned then too. From the Palmer raids to the Japanese Internment, immigrants if anything were viewed more suspiciously than they are today. I don't say \"for good reason\" because I think then and now we are devoid of any good reason. People came to America for the same reasons in 1789, 1909, and 1999: A desire to live freely and earn their fortune in the greatest nation in the world. No amount of anti-immigration zealtry can change that.\n The \"horrors of hypens\" you refer to also strikes me as a misplaced fear. America isn't as strong as it is today because of some monolithic culture which immigrants are \"rejecting.\" America is strong because the strongest principle we have is a free marketplace of ideas, where anyone can advocate anything and we trust in the minds and voices of a free people to sort things out themselves. Implicit in this is two things. First, anyone can have any culture they want, and yes, they can and should do it here. Second, being the rational and intelligent people we are, we pick and choose to create a synthesis of all the best aspects of every culture (Hegelian Dialectic). This is why I can drive 5 minutes into town and choose between Chinese, Meditteranean, Italian, Japanese, Mexican, or Continental cuisine. More deeply, it is how we recieved many aspects of our music, literature, art, amd culture in general. Multiculturalism is America's greatest strength, both in terms of internal growth and external security. As Charles Ogletree, Professor of Law at Harvard University puts it \"The U.S. has not been a fertile breeding ground for terrorism... diversity, religious and ethnic tolerance, a reliance on legal proceedings open to public scrutiny... are all values make it hard to nurture in the U.S. the ethnic or religious hatred that fuels much terrorism.\" In contrast to European countries where ethnic and minority groups are made to feel as outsiders from the \"norm,\" the US holds as one of its chief moral values the ideal that immigrants are the norm, that the US is a nation made up of a amalgamation of other countries, ethnicities, religions, and opinions.\n \n Ultimately, I'd assert one would be hard pressed to identify an \"american\" culture that DIDN'T come through immigrants. After all, with the exception of native americans (who \"white america\" has spent the past 300 years oppressing), we are all immigrants to some degree. Abandoning that tradition now would be abandoning America.",

I would wager syklopps does not live in an ethnically diverse area. Since I have been in S FL, I have been exposed to a large hispanic population. The people come from every country south of Miami, and they come in search of the American values that we take for granted. They are also some of the hardest working people I have ever met. (of course there are exceptions everywhere, but I speak of the masses) And as far as keeping their culture, that is their right as Americans. America is made up of diverse cultures from all over the world, and in time, they tend to blend together into the rising concept of an American culture. Now I do agree that they should learn english and strive for citizenship, but most do. It is a common misconception that everyone from Cuba or Haiti are here illegally and just waiting for la migra to come and get them. This is totally false. Since I have been here, I have met so many interesting people from Cuba it would simply amaze you. One of my closest friends is a Cuban immigrant who speaks english better than some natural American citizens. He has been here for 3 years, is working very hard to get his citizenship, a fact of which he is very proud. Once I asked him why he chose to come to America, and he simply said \"freedom\". This is a person who appreciates America more than most natural born citizens do, because he knows what it is like to have very little. Yes, America does have a large problem with illegals, however most are here for the same reasons, they just do not go about it legally. In Cuba, to come to the US legally, you must be selected through a lottery, and many Cubans desire freedom so bad, that the chose to risk their lives on rafts and boats to get to America rather than wait the years it may take to get here legally. I am sure it is the same with many Mexicans. So just be a little careful in your generalizations.",

First of all, that the CBC doesn't have power NOW doesn't mean they can't ADVOCATE things. So once again, I ask you to support your assertion that what they advocate can qualitatively said to be monolithically good for blacks and monolithically bad for whites. It shouldn't be too hard, just visit their website!\n Second, I'm in half agreement with you on how immigrants behaved in years past, but I think you're creating a false distinction. The point I made in my last post was that even as immigrants in years past assimillated (as you say yourself, rather successfully), they were lambasted on all sides for being too ethnocentric and not being \"american\" enough. Today, I see the exact situation, immigrants working to become part of the American dream and being criticized for not trying hard enough. I honestly can see zero differnece in behavioral patterns between immigrants in the past and those now. The only difference from your standpoint: when your family was an immigrant you claimed you were assimillating fine thanks, and now as an observer from entrenched america, you assail those doing the same. Since all the \"examples\" you cited of immigrants not assimillating I showed you happened with every wave of immigration, your points are non-unique and empirically denied.\n \nWith all due respect, this is just not true, that's the BS espoused by Clinton and the Left. This country is strong because immigrants came together to become Americans first. All this hyphenated BS just weakens us, pits us against each other\n \n What is \"American\"? I need you to define that before you go any further, because I define America as an amalgamation of different cultures, ethnicities, beliefs etc. all here to enjoy the freedom to be different.\n \n \nI did not mean to imply that I think they are the same...but essentially similar. The tendency to favor welfare programs and governmental giveaways leads me to say that. While I do not think the liberals want to abolish private ownership of property (after all, there are a lot of rich property owning liberals), I do see a tendency toward having the productive population provide support to those who choose not to work.\n \n The problem with \"liberalism\" as a term is its somewhat vague. The \"classical\" definition of liberalism would be defined as libertarian, that is, total freedom for individuals and minimal government interference. On a modern left-right scale, \"liberalism\" is socially liberal and economically conservative. Modern liberals fuse an allowance for govt. interference in the economy with an abhorence for its interfence in social issues (conservatives tend to do the reverse). This type of liberalism, economically, is the moderate form of socialism (but this is no more meaningful than saying that modern conservatives, on social issues, is a moderate form of fascism). Whether or not there has been a successful socialist country depends on how expansive your definition is. Sweden and the rest of Scandanavia could be seen as successful socialism for example.\n What American liberals tend to advocate is very different than the qualities you lay out for them. Modern liberals realize that the free market, left to its own devices, is simply not an adequete mechanism for millions of hardworking human beings. The free market, contrary to conservative rhetoric, tends to minimize employment, minimize benefits, and minimize the amount of money that flows to the working class. Liberals don't wish to abolish the free market but merely reform it so it is more efficient. For example, traditional economic theory dictates that money has a higher multiplier effect (is more stimulative) when it is given to poor people as opposed to rich people. However, in a laissez-faire system, this isn't what occurs (look at the industrial revolution, millions of dollars held by a few barons as workers labor with almost no protections and pittance wages). Liberals recognize that is makes both social and economic sense to force some of that money to be redistributed, both because it gives people due reward for working (as my dear friend Bill Clinton put it \"if you work hard and play by the rules, no one should be forced to live in poverty\"), but it also is BETTER for the economy than laissez-faire is. Liberals don't tend to advocate paying people who can work but are too lazy to. We advocate paying people who can work but arent ABLE to because the market naturally has unemployement. Furthermore, true liberals would advocate aggressive job-training so that people who are thrown out of work can get back into the marketplace, especially in depressed areas where the old jobs simply aren't to be found.\n Welfare \"reform\" is an interesting case scenario. The old system was clearly problematic, for the reasons you imply, it would pay people who were lazy. The conservative solution, however, merely exacerbated the problem. By making the goal of welfare to get people off the welfare rolls (as opposed to on the job rolls), there was zero incentive for the states to spend the money to get these people employed. The impacts were obvious: states made draconian requirements to stay on welfare, and when people who were looking for a job, were unable to find one, they were kicked off welfare and conservatives declared victory. I would submit that if we are going to have poor people in despair with no job, its morally better to give them a certain amount of money then to leave them with zero hope, but that isn't the issue. The proper solution lies in the middle ground, where we create incentives to work, not punishments for not working. This is why the EITC is my favorite federal program ever, it rewards people for working hard and moving up the economic ladder WITHOUT hurting those who aren't able to (incidentally, EITC fraud is the only tax fraud issue that the Bush administration has expressed any interest in prosecuting. That thousands of poor americans who are unable to provide adequate documentation are being targeted for tax fraud that amounts to, at most, a few thousand dollars per person, by an administration that has done more than any other to exempt rich americans from paying their fair share to society is sick irony).",

The CBC are lying in wait to destroy white America. Multiculturalism is a creation of the liberal left designed to destroy white America. The taco I ate this weekend is an example of white self hatred and will ultimately destroy America.\n If you aren't willing to believe anything the CBC says, then their is no way to prove you wrong. But I can't figure out their motive to lie. Let's examine this logically, because I think your position isn't really tenable even from your own assumptions.\n You assume two things:\n 1) \"Black\" interests will directly or indirectly harm whites\n 2) The CBC is a group dedicated to advancing those interests\n Now, if that's the case, why would they lie to make their positions more tenable to white america? Whites aren't their constituency. It serves absolutely no purpose to try to appeal to whites within your framework, because even if they fooled them once to get into power, they'd lose power in the next election when whites realized they were lying. You're theory only works if the CBC BOTH is totally beholden to \"black\" interests AND has a deep prevailing desire to gain white votes. Occam's razor would suggest the simpler solution: they are telling the truth and that \"black\" and \"white\" positions aren't the polar opposites you claim they are.\n \n Next: you say that America is lots of people from all over the place here to form ONE country. Fine. I think that one country is a nice, happy, multicultural salad bowl of different beliefs. But even buying your assumption that America is a monolithic culture, why does that culture have to be WASPish? Why can't I assert that the monolithic culture is latino? Or native american (which would make the most sense of all)? You are substituting the dominant culture for \"the\" culture, and that isn't a valid assumption. \n Then you claim that multiculturalism weakens us because it creates domestic enemies.\n 1) Why are seperate groups within America \"enemies\" of each other? I haven't seen a race riot in a while. Those \"uppity\" blacks seem relatively content with our wonderful society. I don't see the racial hatred you speak of, and where it IS present is in the locations most likely to espouse the anti-diversity rhetoric you talk of.\n 2) Not only this, but you ignore ALL the analysis I gave previously about the benefits of multiculturalism. I tell you that it has contributed to what \"american\" culture their is, I give you the food example, and I even gave you the quote by Prof. Ogletree of Harvard about how it makes us more safer. In response, you essentially say I'm just wrong without providing any analysis behind it. You've seen this yourself with your wife, why do you insist on viewing her as the exception rather than the rule?\n Your point on historical revisionism and current vs. past waves of immigration merely reinforces my point. I said, based on my observations of current immigration trends, modern immigrants are doing everything they are supposed to: they are fighting for freedom, building businesses, and, as you so convienantly cite, proud to be here. I then say that the divisive characteristics you cite were present in all waves of immigration, to which you claim I'm reading revisionist histories (warrant?). IF the books are revisionist however, it just means past immigrants are WORSE than they are today, the books are revising history to make them look better and more like the excellent immigrants I see today.\n Then you basically request of immigrants to SPEAK ENGLISH. Two responses:\n 1) Learning a new language is HARD. Speaking as someone who has tried with very little success to learn Spanish, I am reticent to criticize those who have trouble doing it as well (esp. considering English is extremely tough to learn).\n 2) Perhaps immigrants should learn the official language of the US. But since we don't have an official language (english is NOT the official language of america), that doesn't mean anything. English happens to be the language spoken by most Americans. But once again, that's no different then claiming that white is the skin color held by most americans? should all blacks get plastic surgery so they aren't seen as \"different\"? W/out an official language, there is zero reason to claim immigrants are worse humans because they dont speak english, and your arguement is merely based off of prejudice.\n \n And finally, not to jump into the economics debate, but the answer to your question is another question \"how many businesses are dependent on SPENDING from the poor?\" The reason that the economic law I cited (the law of diminishing returns) holds true is because the poor are more likely to spend than the rich. Money given to the poor is almost immediately pumped back in to the economy, money given to the rich is put in savings accounts, or if it is spent, it is spent on luxury goods which are often imported (buying a Ferrari helps Italians alot, but Americans very little). And to answer your question more directly: very few americans work for the rich. Many work for rich CORPORATIONS, but corporate tax brackets are seperate than individual tax brackets. Oh, and small businesses employ more people than mego-corps. So a responsible tax policy (and the liberal tax policy) is to cut taxes on the middle and lower class (so they spend more), and small businesses (so they hire more).",

Allthough there is some truth to it. Before the late eightees, Sweden was among the richest countries in the world.

The result was eventually disastrous and Swedish economy took a nosedive. In 1991 election the Liberal/conservative alliance won their first victory in a decade (and so took out the social democrats) and tried to deal with the crisis. It didn`t go so well, capital flight was a fact as the market didn`t trust the liberal/conservatives pledge to not devalue the Krona (swedish currency)and interest rates where raised to keep the value of the Krona, resulting in 500% short term interest rate for a weekend, at least three crise packages where outlined and agreed on by the liberal/conservative alliance and social democrats. But it was all for nothing. The swedish krona was cut loose and plummeted, resulting in a much reduced purchase power of the swedish public. This all led to a serious recession and a huge governmental debt. To combat the structural causes for the recession and to get rid of the debt, the liberal/conservative alliance did little to nothing. In the following election (1994) the social democrats (together with the communists and green party) won a majority in the parliament and started to cut down on governmental expenditures and governmental and communal employments without cutting taxes.

And I definatly would agree that Canada could be called a wellfare state (and highly succesfull as well) but it says little of the political and ideological base of the dominating parties. What makes most scandinavian wellfare state different from the german wellfare state is its socialistic base, Germany has a largely conservative base. And while it may not seem to matter while merely looking at figures, it has a large impact on how the wellfare state works.",

Interesting how the Liberal/Conservatives didn't work on the decifit at all. What I'm most curious about is the attempted trade between low employment and inflation. How is that done, what kind of programs were put in place? Gairdner talked about the Swedish government in \"The War Against the Family\" quite a bit. His main observation is that the more power you give to the government, the weaker \"bottom up\" organizations become... such as the nuclear and general family and local groups. People become dependent on the Gov't rather than themselves and the people around them. He said that family bonds had become quite weak in Sweden... partially on purpose and partially because the \"top down\" government weakens other power structures purposely or not. For instance, apartments were made small on purpose in some cases so that there wouldn't be enough room for a family to house their grandparents.\n \n I think that Sweden's numbers supported by the State must have been, and still are amoung the highest, since their tax as % of GDP is substantially higher than other countries. For instance, Canada's tax is about 35% of GDP and the US is about 30%. The money's got to go somewhere.\n \n Just learned a bit about Switzerland's political stucture lately... it's really interesting. They have a lot of direct democracy, and the local governments have a lot of freedom. Gairdner noted that they can call a referendum if the Gov't fails to meet the budget two years in a row. Apparently they have the highest per capita income in the world. No doubt that is because of their extremely stable currency, backed by gold, and their neutrality over the years. Then again, they're neutral because the people want it that way.",

   "Sorry for the late reply. I was away during the weekend and there was quite much to reply to :)\n \n \nTrue. The ultimate goal of socialism apparently is to eliminate the difference between the lowest and highest employee in a company. They beleive that this way resources will be used for the good of the 'working' people rather than the interests of the greedy capitalists seeking maximum benefit to themselves. \n\n \n There is some truth to this, allthough I would like to point out that socialism is in essence about owning the means of the productions. But as governmental ownersip is a bit problematic in some cases (not really economicly sound), correcting the flaws in the distribution of resoursec in a capitailistic economy might be the \"second best alternative\"\n \n \n They also make a distinction between Government controlling the means of production and the People. I find that interesting since the average Leftist (which I generally equate with Socialist) seems to have little faith in the ability of Average Joe to live his life without help from them.\n\n \n The disticntion they make is in line with traditional marxist thought of the state as an oppressive (abeit less oppressive than the capitalistic system) force (or class if you will). What puzzles me is that they seem to believe that the transistion from the capitalistic system to the utopian communistic can be achieved at once (not that they use that many words...) This is not something I would attibute to traditional socialists or communists... rather anarcho.socialists (your average left-wing anarchists).\n \n As for the little faith in Average Joe\n I think this has two dimension. First, we have the paternalistic idea of economics. That is, the idea that the government should encourage or discourage consumption or production of certain goods. Ths is basicly a sound strategy that is being used by any kind of government (most commonly used to encourage education and reasearch or used to discourage drugs or enviromentally harmful products). But it is quite possible that left winged government are more inclined to use these strategies (perhaps because they are most often financed through taxes)\n Secondly we have the idea of structuralism where individuals actions are not so much a product of their conciuos choice, but rather a product of structures, institutions, norms and other forms of social constructs. The most important structre according to traditional marxism is the economic system (today; capitalism). \n \n \n It seems that the \"Welfare State\" (that's from \"The War Against the Family\" by William Gairdner) tends to have more government control of the means of production. Actually the control of these means by the People is quite radical (as you said, there's no example today) while the control by the Government is pretty commonplace. In my province the Gov't controls the Energy, Health, Telephone, and probably some other industries. (other telephone companies are allowed to compete, but I beleive private hospitals are illegal)\n \n\n \n Yeah, the government is very important from a socialistic perspective. Its about political (democratic) control of the economy. Allthough I would like to point out that there is a form of capital that the government tries to increase with the sole intent of putting it in the hands of the people. Education.\n \n \n \n Then again, its hard to know just what Marx meant when he said \"socialization of the means of production\". Ludwig von Mises, in \"Socialism\", says that Marx used the term social or community interchangably throughout his arguements (von Mises claims that this is what allowed him to \"prove the unprovable\") as meaning the State, the People, or simply a club of sorts. He could have meant the State should control industry, even if his ultimate vision was for the State to \"dissolve\".\n \n\n \n That is a good point. I would argue that Marx:s idea of socialisation of the means of production should be seen as an ideal of a classless society. When the classes has been disolved through elimination of the ruling class, there will be no conflict of interests. The means of production will be used to further the interests of the populace (or the single class). How this should be organised could of course be argued. But I would say that the most probable solution would be through governmental ownership of the means of production due to the nature of state monopoly on violence.\n \n \n \n Interesting how the Liberal/Conservatives didn't work on the decifit at all.\n\n \n That`s probably some bias from my part ;). I`m sure they tried to do some, but I think they where quite paralyzed after the whole fiasko with maintaining the monetary system. In their defense I must also admit that their government relied on the support from a particulary untrustworthy and frankly worthless political party which was eliminated after the next election.\n \n \n \n\n Its an excellent history lesson!\n\n \n Thank you :)\n \n \n Interesting how the Liberal/Conservatives didn't work on the decifit at all.\n\n \n That`s probably some bias from my part ;). I`m sure they tried to do some, but I think they where quite paralyzed after the whole fiasko with maintaining the monetary system. In their defense I must also admit that their government relied on the support from a particulary untrustworthy and frankly worthless political party which was eliminated after the next election.\n \n \n. What I'm most curious about is the attempted trade between low employment and inflation. How is that done, what kind of programs were put in place?\n\n \n It was done through highly expansive financial politic through an high governmental expenditure and devaluation of the Krona during the oil crisis. While other countries suffered high unemployment, Sweden had low unemployment but increasing inflation.\n \n There is a short term relationship between unemployment and inflation. Really how this relationship works has yet to be proved, but it has been empiricly observed. This relationship is referred to as the phillips curve. But there has been empiricly proved that there is no relationship between inflation and unemployment in long term. Apparantly the trade of is succesful in short term as the emploers and employees are slow to predict the inflation. But in long term, they do predict the inflation and act accordingly. IE; if the inflation is 5%, the employees, or rather their unions will in the long run demand a wage increase that reflects the inflation. \n \n This was what happened in sweden. The employers and the unions predicted high inflation and future devalueations and this led to the eventual downfall of the Krona as well as high unemployment. \n \n \n Gairdner talked about the Swedish government in \"The War Against the Family\" quite a bit. His main observation is that the more power you give to the government, the weaker \"bottom up\" organizations become... such as the nuclear and general family and local groups. People become dependent on the Gov't rather than themselves and the people around them. He said that family bonds had become quite weak in Sweden... partially on purpose and partially because the \"top down\" government weakens other power structures purposely or not. For instance, apartments were made small on purpose in some cases so that there wouldn't be enough room for a family to house their grandparents.\n \n\n \n That`s an interesting take. I would argue that the most important aspect of govermnenal action concerning the \"weakening of the family bonds\" is the large public sector. This public sector has been dominated by women and has proved to be of great importance for the emancipation of the women (as it early offered women a way to get away from their economic dependance of their spouses). Perhaps there is some truth to the top-down argument as well, but to be honest, I don`t think the family ties in Sweden are any less strong than any other northern european or anglo-saxon culture with high living standards.\n \n As for building small apartments. I think it was more an issue of creating cheap apartments. We had a large housing problem that was solved by large social programs where the government created housing 1 million (which named it the \"millionprograme\"). But there may be some truth to the idea of specialising the workforce by re-locating the \"old folks\" ;)\n \n \n I think that Sweden's numbers supported by the State must have been, and still are amoung the highest, since their tax as % of GDP is substantially higher than other countries. For instance, Canada's tax is about 35% of GDP and the US is about 30%. The money's got to go somewhere. \n\n \n I think the big diffenece lie in how you use the taxes. The Swedish wellfare state is inclusive in the sence that all services and most monetary support is not based on income. For example in Sweden everyobody get child support from the state (assuming they have children) regardless of income and no-one has to pay for education (its in fact not permitted to attach a fee to schools apart from highly specialised educations on collage level). \n \n \n Just learned a bit about Switzerland's political stucture lately... it's really interesting. They have a lot of direct democracy, and the local governments have a lot of freedom. Gairdner noted that they can call a referendum if the Gov't fails to meet the budget two years in a row. Apparently they have the highest per capita income in the world. No doubt that is because of their extremely stable currency, backed by gold, and their neutrality over the years. Then again, they're neutral because the people want it that way. \n\n \n Yeah, Switzerland is a bit of an oddity when it comes to their democratic system. They have a representative system as well, and their government consists of all parties (instead of those parties who co-operate to achieve a majority in the parliament). I think it has to do with the heterogenous population (they have three or two different languages and three or two different cultures)",
