   "If you think it's because it's the time of year when we celebrate Christ's birth, you'd be wrong. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure GOD rejoiced the day Christ was born but that's NOT what excites HIM today.\n \n What excites GOD is seeing so many people and businesses helping their fellow man. All year long GOD watches us take advantage of each other and live like earthly possessions are what's important. Then as Christmas gets closer and closer HE sees men, woman and children doing little things to make each others lives a little bit nicer and HE begins to get PROUD of us.\n \n I wish I could mention ALL the GOOD DEEDS GOD'S excited about today but I'd NEVER get this message written because as soon as I thought I had them ALL recorded someone else would do something else that needed to be added. So I'll just tell you GOD LOVES the Christmas Season and now you know why.\n \n Since I CAN'T list ALL the GOOD DEEDS GOD'S proud of, I'll tell the ones that got me to thinking about writing this message. In this morning's paper, I read a story about a family that gave $10,000 to the Meals On Wheels program. That one brought tears to my eyes. Meals On Wheels gets $1,000 or two now and then but they NEVER got $10,000 all at once. As COOL as that gift is, it almost goes UNNOTICED this time of year because SOOOO MANY people are doing SPECIAL THINGS for OTHERS and that's what GOD LOVES about the Christmas Season.\n \n Another thing that got me thinking about writing this message, that was in today's paper, was a story about an adopted man who was looking for his real mother. Twenty some years ago she gave her baby up for adoption rather than getting an abortion. She knew she was too young to bring up a child but she was mature enough to do the RIGHT THING even though she had to make a lot of sacrifices to have that child and because she had that child.\n \n I'm sure that happens all year long but the HOLIDAY SEASON makes people look up friends and family that we DON'T have time for all year long. That's what the story taught me. To be fare the man had been looking for his mother for some time. According to the story, the man had the WRONG last name for his mother so he couldn't find her. Maybe it was GOD'S intervention or just the Christmas Spirit at work but sure enough once he knew what the RIGHT last name was he found his mother. To his surprise, they both worked at the same home improvement business. Maybe that was GOD'S way of making sure they were going to be together for the holiday this year.\n \n Don't you just LOVE the Christmas Season? I know GOD DOES and now I love it more thanks to HIM.\n \n Merry Christmas from GOD and HE wants to thank you for making HIS Holiday Season the best ever. As bad as the economy might be people are finding ways to make sure NO ONE goes without during this Holiday Season.\n \n GOD wants you to know HE'S watching us and HE'S going to remember everything. So DON'T forget the Christmas Spirit once the season is over. HE wants us to keep making HIM PROUD of us and who knows what HE'LL do for us because of it.\n \n MERRY CHRISTMAS and a HAPPY NEW YEAR",

   "Enjoy\n\n \n With things like human sacrifice as a part of the pagan versions (as your video pointed out), it's a good thing Christianity reformed these pagan holidays and made them Christian. I always find it sorta funny that critics of Christianity think they're debunking something with this sort of thing. Things like trees and lights are so general that it's only natural human civilisation would use them to some extent in any religious celebration. Bottom line ... who cares Dec. 25th was once a pagan holiday? It's a Christian one now. Things change.",
