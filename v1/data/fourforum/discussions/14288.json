They do not know for sure what the result is going to be of anything which they are doing,\" he told CBS' Face the Nation.\n \n In Louisiana, which has borne the brunt of the oil spill impact so far, senators and local authorities demanded that BP and the federal government rush into place a plan to create a sand barrier to the oil by dredging and building up and joining up outlying sandbanks and islets.\n \n \"I'm devastated ... We are dying a slow death, every time that oil takes out a piece of the marsh, a piece of Louisiana is gone forever,\" said Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines parish, where the oil has clogged wetlands.\n \n \"Even the government seems powerless and all the experts. If these people can't stop it, then who in the name of God can?\" Father Gerry, a priest at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Port Sulpur, said, his voice heavy with emotion.\n \n \"OIL COMING UP 'TIL AUGUST\"\n \n After giving up an attempt to pump heavy fluids and blocking materials into the leaking well to \"kill\" it on Saturday, BP engineers are now pursuing another option from their undersea toolbox to try to contain the seabed oil gusher.\n \n Surge of anger as BP struggles to plug leak",

THE COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINERS offers an oddly beautiful take on life through a sobering look at death, with an affection for science and medical progress, an ode to all things morbidly educational. We&#8217;re intricate machines, us humans, and when those around us die, we should be reminded of our lives; and when those around us die horribly or are murdered, we should take comfort in the fact that a decedent can speak from the slab and point with bloody finger at its killer. Medicine and science exalts us, and coupled with ethical considerations, ascends us to a godhood over our own destinies. When life is framed by birth and death, ennobling it with brief temporal beauty, and we master the understanding of its terminating end, well, we&#8217;ve achieved something wonderful. TCME tries to keep the lyrics firmly in the CARCASS realm, but with a penchant for medical history and discovery (we&#8217;ve three new songs on this album dealing with the lives of early trailblazing anatomists and pathologists) and medico criminology, as well as a reveling in the disgusting aspects of death, because while revolting at first, you&#8217;d be surprised at the art involved with putrefaction; the colors alone&#8212;detailed in our new song &#8220;Kaleidoscopic Malacia&#8221;&#8212;can rival that of an Impressionist oil painting. There&#8217;s a sublime economy to death and dissolution. It&#8217;s absurd, but so is death, and while there is gravity in the topic, there is also great joy. All this makes for plenty of song topics.&#8221;\n \n Enough said. That does only refer to TCME lyrics, but still... I don't care what you find offensive. If you're offended by petty things such as music that you don't like, then I think you deserve to be offended. Sometimes I deserve to be offended, when I let those zero-talent pop turds like Kesha or the Millionaires irritate me.\n \n \n\n And I'm astonished that there isn't a group called The Necrophiliacs, with the same teenaged band members rutting with rotting corpses.\n \n Or the Copromaniacs otherwise known as the Fecalphiliacs, who dab themselves all over with human feces before going on stage.\n \n\n \n You really have to learn that musicians have lives outside their music. Of course, anyone who does something you doesn't like is racist, evil, and of course, right-wing, somehow.\n \n I know this is off topic, but I have to mention that most metal bands prefer not to identify themselves as a group of musicians using their band name (ie having a name \"The (insert name here)s).\n \n You'd see that in older rock bands like the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, and in older punk rock bands like The Ramones or The Sex Pistols, but most metal bands of any kind of metal prefer to avoid such names. \n \n \nIndeed, a lot less relevant.\n\n \n Then why don't you explain what my personal understanding of mathematics has to do with US politics or my understanding of it?",

   "BP and the administration's claims that an accident of this magnitude could not have been predicted is belied by an increasing mountain of evidence that BP deliberately ignored warning signs, with the help of the federal Minerals Management Service.\n \n Citing internal BP documents, the New York Times reported on Sunday that engineers expressed concern as early as June 2009 about the well casing used in the Deepwater Horizon operation. A report by a BP engineer that month warned that the casing could collapse under the high pressure at the depths BP was drilling.\n \n \"This would certainly be a worst-case scenario,\" Mark E. Hafle, a senior drilling engineer at BP, wrote in the report. \"However, I have seen it happen so know it can occur.\"\n \n According to the Times, \"The company went ahead with the casing, but only after getting special permission from BP colleagues because it violated the company's safety policies and design standards. The internal reports do not explain why the company allowed for an exception.\"\n \n The Times goes on to report, \"In April of this year, BP engineers concluded that the casing was 'unlikely to be a successful cement job,' according to a document, referring to how the casing would be sealed to prevent gases from escaping up the well.\" The document also concluded that the casing was unlikely to fulfill regulatory requirements from the MMS.\n \n In the weeks preceding the explosion on April 20, there were many signs of problems, including sudden and repeated releases of gas from the well.\n \n \"On at least three occasions, BP records indicate, the blowout preventer was leaking fluid, which the manufacturer of the device has said limits its ability to operate properly,\" the Times reported. Loss of well control led to a halt of operations, but no assessment was made as to whether or not the drilling should continue.\n \n \"After informing regulators of their struggles, company officials asked for permission to delay their federally mandated test of the blowout preventer, which is supposed to occur every two weeks, until the problems were resolved, BP documents say.\" After first denying this request, the MMS reversed itself.\n \n According to the Times, \"When the blowout preventer was eventually tested again, it was tested at a lower pressure-6,500 pounds per square inch-than the 10,000-pounds-per-square-inch tests used on the device before the delay. It tested at this lower pressure until the explosion.\"\n \n In other words, both BP and government officials were aware the well was causing major problems that could lead to a blowout, and that the blowout preventer itself was experiencing problems. Yet BP, with the agreement of the government agency, decided to rig the tests and ignore the warnings of a potential disaster so it could continue drilling.\n \n Failure of BP?s ?top kill? means oil will continue to flow for months",
