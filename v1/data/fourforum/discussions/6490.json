   "\n Boy fights for right to play on girls team Lawsuit will affect field hockey at Forsythe \n Thursday, September 22, 2005\n BY NATHAN FENNO \n News Sports Reporter \n A few minutes after practice started Wednesday afternoon, Maxime Goovaerts ran onto the field and joined the rest of Forsythe Middle School's girls field hockey team. \n But behind the happy chatter of another practice, a legal battle is being waged over whether the 13-year-old boy can play on a girls team. \n Nathalie Vandecan, Goovaerts' mother, sued Ann Arbor Public Schools last Friday, alleging violations of Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act. The lawsuit accuses Ann Arbor Public Schools, among other things, of denying Goovaerts \"the full utilization and benefit of services, opportunities, activities and programs provided by (the) Defendant because of his sex.'' \n On Wednesday morning, the parties reached an agreement allowing Goovaerts to play while the case is pending in court. That hasn't changed the status of the lawsuit or the Ann Arbor Public Schools' view that boys shouldn't play on girls teams. \n \"We're pretty strong in our position that this is a girls sport,'' said George Fornero, Ann Arbor schools superintendent. \"We don't want to get in a situation where we take up slots with boys for girls teams or the boys physically dominate the girls out there.'' \n Goovaerts played for the girls team at Forsythe last year. But, Vandecan said, Ann Arbor school officials told her earlier this month that her son couldn't play this year because the school had to remain in compliance with Title IX, the landmark 1972 federal legislation that requires equal educational opportunities for male and female students. Forsythe doesn't have a boys field hockey team. \n Vandecan sat in the shade and watched practice alone Wednesday, pleased that her son was back on the field, but uncertain of what is ahead. \n \"I'm just cautious,'' Vandecan said. \"I'm excited, but I'm scared, too, of the unknown.'' \n After the court order spelling out the agreement was signed, Fornero said the district hasn't changed its position. \n Vandecan said her son, who has also dabbled in soccer and golf and is interested in figure skating, learned field hockey from one of her nephews. Goovaerts is about 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds, smaller than some of the girls on the field hockey team. \n \"He is thus certainly not a danger on the field,'' Vandecan wrote in an e-mail to Fornero. \n No players are cut from the team, Vandecan said. In the e-mail, she wrote that Goovaerts wouldn't play if it meant keeping a girl off the team. \n Fornero said he wasn't aware of any other boys on girls teams in the district. Fornero said he allowed Goovaerts to play last season because the decision to keep boys off girls teams was made after the season started. \n \"There was a significant reaction when they played other teams,'' Fornero said. \"Parents said, 'We could have a winning team if we put boys on our teams.' We changed the rules midseason. The coach at that school (Forsythe) had not put the word out.'' \n Vandecan's attorney, Marla Linderman, cited a similar case that occurred in Traverse City in 1987, when the Michigan Civil Rights Commission told the Traverse Area Public School District to let boys play on girls volleyball teams after a challenge by an eighth-grader. The district later had to pay a girls volleyball coach $43,600 because it had fired her for letting boys on the team. The district spent $160,484 fighting the case. \n Goovaerts and his family are originally from Belgium and have lived in Ann Arbor for five years. Vandecan said her son was \"very excited'' when she stopped by Forsythe and told him he'd be able to play Wednesday. \n But the lawsuit looms over the sunny field behind the school that was filled with swinging hockey sticks and the cries of children Wednesday. \n \"They think they're using Title IX,'' Linderman said of Ann Arbor Public Schools. \"They don't understand the law.''\n http://www.mlive.com/news/aanews/index.ssf?/base/news-14/1127400223147430.xml&coll=2&thispage=2\n \n\n \n The biggest irony here is that Ann Arbor, the home of the University of Michigan, is one of the most liberal cities in the country. It's interesting listening to politically-correct liberals whine about Title IX being used against them. I say \"hoist them on their own petard\". Expose them for the hypocrites that they are. emoticon_xgood",

It has turned into co-ed and girls teams instead of boys and girls teams. Why not just make all the teams co-ed? You don't want discrimination?

How about we give them enough help to be fairly represented (note this means more whites than blacks on each team)? If AA is justifies, why not my version?",

They will do things for minorities, but when majorities want the SAME thing they say \"but you don't need the help, you're in the majority\". There are many cultural heritage clubs at our school. Ethiopian, Chinese, Korean, Cambodian, Japonese, just to name a few. I've thought about trying to start a white heritage club (of course other races are welcome just as whites are welcome to all other clubs. That's the excuse they make for having racial clubs). I just want to see what the reaction would be when people hear the announcement. The problem is I would have to find a teacher to sponsor the club, and in one of the most liberal schools in the country (I think, Nader got more votes than Bush in our district) most people would think it was a joke (which it actually sort of is) or just getting mad and calling me a racist.",

Unfortunately, most men won't attack this truly discriminatory practice for fear that they'll be ridiculed for wanting to join a \"girl's team\".

In my favorite sport, drag racing, women compete with men on an equal footing and have been quite successful in many classes, including Top Fuel Dragster, the top class in racing.\n Imagine what 5 male street ballers could do against UCONN's women's B-Ball team, for example.

Very little whites and asians play football. Why not have a black team, white team, and an asian team? I understand your point but why not apply it to other things?\n \n What about basketball? Being short is a genetic disadvantage just as gender is. So why not have height teams. You have the 6' and over team, the 5'6\" and over team or in smaller intervals.\n \n We have a kid who is not short but not tall either at our school. He tried out for the original school team and got cut. Every single day for 2 hours after school he shoots, does drills, runs suicides, and a bunch of stuff to get better at basketball. He plays basketball with friends after school. He asked the coach what he needed to do to make the team next year, any suggestions for drills or anything. The suggestion was \"get taller\". People were over a foot taller than him and he has no hope of playing. But he continues to practice all afternoon as people are going home. If I were the coach I would take him on my team just because of the work ethic and the hope he would inspire others even if he doesn't play a minute. But the coach is more worried about fancy stuff and dunks and such. I haven't seen this guy play much other than in the gym on my way out of school but apparently he is one of the best players in terms of machanics, conditioning, and work ethic. Why shouldn't he be the best player on the 5'8\" and up team? Yes you complain about how girls wouldn't play, what about short people? What about white people? What about black people in terms of baseball?\n \n I'm not claiming I have the answer and I have to say that in general I would think there should be equal opportunity and no girls on boys teams or vice versa, but I also don't think it's fair that another genetic difference, height, can make that much difference, or something like race. Why is the gender genetic difference the only one recognized? I don't know, maybe other people have other thoughts.",

I realize it may not be legal, but if that's your choice, as far as I'm concerned, have at it.\n \n If some white guys somewhere want top set up a football league where they can play against other white guys of the same skill level, why should Terrell Owens have the right to join that league?\n \n You can only have it one way or the other IMHO. Either COMPLETE equality or seperation by rule, no exceptions.\n \n If women want to play in men's leagues, then men should have every right to play in women's leagues. If white guys want to play in the black guy's league, then the black guys have every right to play in the white guy's league. Ultimately, in a competetive environment, IMHO, that's how it should work, but that's not so good if you're a female hockey player trying to make the NHL, or a 5'4\" white guy trying to make the NBA.\n \n Therefore we have rules to level the playing field based on sex. Like I said, IMHO, that rule should be applicable to anything, the all white basketball league, the all black guys under 5'4\" basketball league, whatever. \n \n The point is, what's the point?\n \n Anyhoo, that was a long rambling response, but I'm really not sure what you're getting at.\n \n Waxy",

   "For one thing, \"more liberal than,\" not make someplace liberal.\n \n Secondly, the location of a university in a town does not by default make a town liberal.\n\n Well, need I remind you that I live less than an hour from Ann Arbor, work with many UofM grads, watch the local news, read local papers, etc.,? I'm guessing that I know more than just the fact that the UofM has the largest college football stadium in the country. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Thirdly, field hockey is played by both sexes in other parts of the world (I played a bit in middles school back where I am from). And it is not a contact sport like ice hockey, so I as a liberal (since that seems to be the issue 'du jour') I have no problem with men playing on the team.\n \n And finally, Title IX works both ways. Why should liberals have a problem with it in this case?\n\n \n Liberals have a problem with it because they know that if men are allowed on women's teams unrestricted, there will be no women's teams anymore. Title IX isn't really about equality, it's about protecting women's opportunities when they're not able to compete on an equal footing with men. It's pure liberal dogma from the get go.",

   "To be honest zachvac, I'm not sure what the point you're trying to get across is. I can somewhat see the line of logic your following, but I think you're missing the forest for the trees.\n \n Are you advocating a \"white football league\" or the \"white olypmics\"?\n \n Separate medals for black and white sprinters at the same olympics?\n \n I have no problem with female only, or white guy only for that matter, sports leagues. I realize it may not be legal, but if that's your choice, as far as I'm concerned, have at it.\n \n If some white guys somewhere want top set up a football league where they can play against other white guys of the same skill level, why should Terrell Owens have the right to join that league?\n \n You can only have it one way or the other IMHO. Either COMPLETE equality or seperation by rule, no exceptions.\n \n If women want to play in men's leagues, then men should have every right to play in women's leagues. If white guys want to play in the black guy's league, then the black guys have every right to play in the white guy's league. Ultimately, in a competetive environment, IMHO, that's how it should work, but that's not so good if you're a female hockey player trying to make the NHL, or a 5'4\" white guy trying to make the NBA.\n \n Therefore we have rules to level the playing field based on sex. Like I said, IMHO, that rule should be applicable to anything, the all white basketball league, the all black guys under 5'4\" basketball league, whatever. \n \n The point is, what's the point?\n \n Anyhoo, that was a long rambling response, but I'm really not sure what you're getting at.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n Honestly? I'm really not trying to make a point. I don't know exactly what I think, which I guess makes it make sense that no one else does either :)\n \n I have generally the same feelings as you, that it's fine to have a female and a male team, as long as it stays that way and good girls aren't allowed on the boys team and vice versa. But when I think about it it's the same for other genetically inherited attributes. Generally I think giving girls the chance to play sports sounds like a good idea, and I fully support that. But I also wouldn't think it was good to have a white league and a black league. They seem like the same thing.
