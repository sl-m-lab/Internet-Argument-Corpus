   "Sorry, going to start out with a long book review from the Wall Street Journal about an incident I'd never heard of before:\n \n The Devil and His Island\n By ARTHUR HERMAN\n January 10, 2006; Page D8\n \"We may note in passing that, oddly enough, it is people who do not believe in Hell who often create good imitations of it on earth.\" That's Belgian writer Simon Leys's observation on the case of the Batavia, a heavily laden Dutch East India Company ship that struck a reef off the western coast of Australia in 1629 and propelled 300 men, women and children into the nightmare world of \"Lord of the Flies\" more than three centuries before William Golding's novel.\n \n Mr. Leys knows what he is talking about. He has written books on Mao and the Cultural Revolution, and on Napoleon. He knows pathological tyranny when he sees it, and here he offers us Jeronimus Cornelisz, the self-appointed absolute dictator of the Batavia's survivors, a man who ran a regime of murder, rape and torture that compares in kind, if not in scope, to anything in the annals of despotism. \"The Wreck of the Batavia\" is a short but compelling picture of human depravity.\n \n The wreck itself was not discovered until 1963, although the story was well known through the eyewitness accounts of survivors. What is so striking about the Batavia case is how quickly, almost effortlessly, everyone from the ship seems to have shed any civilized standard of behavior. Of course, shipwrecks were common in the age of sail, and it was generally understood that when a vessel came to grief in a storm or on the rocks, its captain's authority vanished. Among British sailors, even the imminent threat of a wreck was enough to send the crew into an orgy of destruction, looting and drunkenness.\n \n Mr. Leys describes how the Batavia's smash-up led to a vicious struggle for power among the survivors, stranded on a tiny island in what is today the Houtman Abrolhos archipelago. The winner was a 30-year-old megalomaniac named Jeronimus Cornelisz, one of the Batavia's junior officers and a religious skeptic who evidently lived by the maxim: If there is no God, then everything is permitted.\n \n He had already tried to organize a mutiny while the ship was at sea. Eventually he drove his leading rival to a neighboring island and seized control of the broken ship's ample stores. He and his thugs decked themselves out with braid, ribbons and swords; they threatened anyone who defied their authority. When he learned that some survivors were trying to sail a boat to join his rival on the other island, Cornelisz ordered the boat's occupants massacred and instituted a reign of terror over those who stayed behind.\n \n When help finally arrived from the Dutch colony on Java three months later, only 70 of 300 survivors were still alive. Cornelisz had coldbloodedly and sadistically killed the rest. Women were given the choice of death or sexual relations with their tormentors; those who refused to carry out his grisly death sentences were executed instead. \"From time to time,\" Mr. Leys writes, \"individual victims were selected at random, under various pretexts, or without any reason at all -- for it is always its very arbitrariness that is the essence of an effective Terror\" -- as true of Nazi gas chambers and al Qaeda car bombs as Jeronimus Cornelisz's reign of murder and mayhem.\n \n (More)",

   "Cornelisz left us no clue about what drove him. The captain of the rescue ship had him tried and executed on the spot, without worrying about the motives for his crimes. Mr. Leys, by contrast, speculates about the influence on Cornelisz of the dark subcultures in Holland that lurked beneath the clear bright surface of the age of Vermeer and Rembrandt. Cornelisz's mentor back home was a bizarre immoralist named Torrentius, who claimed to be in league with the devil. Mr. Leys also explores certain Anabaptist sects that claimed to be \"beyond good and evil.\"\n \n But why bother digging for explanations? Perhaps the captain who executed Cornelisz knew him and his compatriots better than we do. For all their intelligence and entrepreneurship, the Dutch in the Golden Age had made themselves strangers to every standard of humanity or compassion. The Batavia had been headed for the Spice Islands, which the Dutch had conquered in wars of unbelievable ferocity. Even as Cornelisz was tormenting his victims, other Dutchmen were turning the Atlantic slave trade into a major industry; still others were waging genocide in South Africa and laying the foundations of apartheid. And today, of course, Holland is the home of Europe's most avid proponents of euthanasia. What is the Dutch for \"Plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose\"?\n \n Mr. Herman is the author of \"To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World,\" just published in paperback by Perennial/HarperCollins.",

   "Gad! Now I have a historical context for understanding Thomas Hobbes. The Batavian event happened in 1629, Hobbes was alive from 1588 to 1679. I would presume that the Batavian event was discussed during Hobbes' lifetime and may have had a profound effect upon him. Hobbes appears to have been in Paris at the time and I'll bet the Parisians had a hot old time discussing the Batavian thing.\n \n I would also presume that there were other recollections of similar shipwrecks and the lawlessness that ensued.\n \n We, unfortunately, do not truly understand why Jeronimus Cornelisz behaved as he did. He claimed to be a religious skeptic, yet his spiritual mentor seems to have been a chap named Torrentius who claimed he was \"in league with the devil.\" Sounds like some sort of Dutch Goth.\n \n I will try to stick to, for the moment, examining more of the historical context of the time without theorizing about feminism and the lowly role of women at the time. But, I'll bet there's a good case for the lack of feminism in those times. I can probably even find some rightwing support for this sort of thought from the likes of George Gilder.",

   "http://www.artnet.com/library/08/0857/T085723.asp\n \n Torrentius, Johannes [Beeck, Jan Simonsz. van der] \n (b Amsterdam, 1589; d Amsterdam, 1644). Dutch painter. He was active in Amsterdam, Leiden and Haarlem. In Haarlem in 1627 he was condemned, after severe torture, to 20 years of imprisonment for impiety, blasphemy and his membership of the outlawed Society of Rosicrucians. After having been notified by Sir Dudley Carleton, the British ambassador in The Hague, Charles I of England intervened and brought about Torrentius's release in 1629. Torrentius was subsequently active from 1629 to 1632 in London, which he nevertheless had to leave, again on account of his purportedly immoral mode of life; he returned to Amsterdam. There he was again involved in a trial and died after suffering torture in 1644. His erotic pictures, some of which depicted masterful nudes in mythological settings and are now known only through literary sources, were publicly burnt. A few still-lifes (e.g. Emblematic Still-life, 1614; Amsterdam, Rijksmus.) have survived. These carefully composed works, mostly set before a dark background, recall the work of Jan van de Velde II and the circle of Willem Claesz. Heda. In Torrentius's pictures the rendering of physical objects is particularly compelling, and their accurate perspective makes it likely that a camera obscura was used.",

   "http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743213424/701-9244119-7189165\n \n From Publishers Weekly\n Like The Lord of the Flies, to which it will inevitably be compared, this fiction debut about the 1629 wreck of the Batavia off the coast of Australia suggests that Robinson Crusoe was lucky to be marooned alone. In the mid-1600s, the Dutch East India Company sponsored a fleet of merchant ships sailing for the Dutch colonies (today's Indonesia). The fleet's flagship, the Batavia, was carrying \"precious artifacts to trade with plump sultans of Mogul courts\" when it struck a reef. The narrator of this fictionalized version of the well-known story is Jeronimus Cornelisz, a 30-year-old apothecary forced to flee Amsterdam after discovery of his participation in \"secret pagan rites.\" After the passengers are offloaded to a barren island, the Commandeur (the company's chief representative) and the skipper sail off in the one usable lifeboat to seek rescue. In their absence, Cornelisz, who believes himself fated to \"receive fortunes and be elected an emperor among men,\" and whose hysterical inability to leave the foundering ship until several days have elapsed is mistaken for chivalry, becomes leader. Before long, he exploits the survivors' trust and establishes a reign of terror. The present-tense, first-person narrative places the reader squarely inside Cornelisz's twisted mind; obtuse and self-absorbed, he is increasingly unreliable and deranged. Suspense lies in guessing at how long Cornelisz will last and how far he will go with bloodshed and debauchery. A mixture of classic sea-adventure yarn and grisly thriller, the book is unlikely to do as well here as it did in Australia, where it was a bestseller and prize winner, but its psychopathic narrator seems a natural for a Hollywood movie.

   "And more esoteric references:\n \n http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_200303/ai_n9192720\n \n \nThe most intellectually satisfying part of the book, to my mind, is the section devoted to Herbert's voyages to Holland and France. Particularly elegant is Shallcross' subtle but conceptually vertiginous analysis of Herbert's ekphratic expose on Torrentius' curious miniature Still Life with a Bridle (a painting the poet almost accidentally encounters in a corner of the Amsterdam Royal Museum) and the subsequent \"hermeneutic journey\" (79) undertaken \"with a sense of mission\" (p. 79) to rationalize the uncanny illumination experienced upon first confronting the canvas, and thereby decode or \"unmask\" the grammar of mystery that permeates it-especially the highly ambivalent interplay between the quotidian and the transcendental objects (pp. 71-90).\n\n \n Bondage, perchance? The bridle, I mean.\n \n The curious word \"ekphratic\"? Pfooey, the relatively mundane meaning of \"seeing is believing\" or something to that effect.",

   "The Grand Tour as tutor with William Cavendish, later Earl of Devonshire in 1610.\n \n \nHe visited Florence in 1636 and later was a regular debater in philosophic groups in Paris, held together by Marin Mersenne. From 1637 he considered himself a philosopher.\n \n Hobbes's first area of study was an interest in the physical doctrine of motion. Despite his interest in this phenomenon, he disdained experimental work as in physics. He went on to conceive the system of thought to the elaboration of which he would devote his life. His scheme was first to work out, in a separate treatise, a systematic doctrine of body, showing how physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion, at least as motion or mechanical action was then understood. He then singled out Man from the realm of Nature. Then, in another treatise, he showed what specific bodily motions were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation, knowledge, affections and passions whereby Man came into relation with Man. Finally he considered, in his crowning treatise, how Men were moved to enter into society, and argued how this must be regulated if Men were not to fall back into \"brutishness and misery\". Thus he proposed to unite the separate phenomena of Body, Man and the State.\nWikipedia\n \n Hobbes returned to England in 1637 but felt obliged to return to Paris:\n \n \nWhen in November 1640 the Long Parliament succeeded to the Short, Hobbes felt he was a marked man by the circulation of his treatise and fled to Paris. He did not return for eleven years. In Paris he rejoined the coterie about Mersenne, and wrote a critique of the Meditations on First Philosophy of Descartes, which was printed as third among the sets of \"Objections\" appended, with \"Replies\" from Descartes in 1641. A different set of remarks on other works by Descartes succeeded only in ending all correspondence between the two.\n \n He also extended his own works a little, working on the third section, De Cive, which was finished in November 1641. Although it was initially only circulated privately, it was well received. He then returned to hard work on the first two sections of his work and published little except for a short treatise on optics (Tractatus opticus) included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne as Cogitata physico-mathematica in 1644. He built a good reputation in philosophic circles and in 1645 was chosen with Descartes, Gilles de Roberval and others, to referee the controversy between John Pell and Longomontanus over the problem of squaring the circle.\n\n Work on The Leviathan:\n \nThe company of the exiled royalists led Hobbes to produce an English book to set forth his theory of civil government in relation to the political crisis resulting from the war. It was based on an unpublished treatise of 1640. The State, it now seemed to Hobbes, might be regarded as a great artificial man or monster (Leviathan), composed of men, with a life that might be traced from its generation under pressure of human needs to its dissolution through civil strife proceeding from human passions. The work was closed with a general \"Review and Conclusion,\" in direct response to the war which raised the question of the subject's right to change allegiance when a former sovereign's power to protect was irrecoverably gone. Also he took advantage of the Commonwealth to indulge in rationalistic criticism of religious doctrines. The first public edition was titled Elementa philosophica de cive.\n \n During the years of the composition of Leviathan he remained in or near Paris. In 1647 Hobbes was overtaken by a serious illness which disabled him for six months. On recovering from this near fatal disorder, he resumed his literary task, and carried it steadily forward to completion by the year 1650, having also translated his prior Latin work into English. In 1650, to prepare the way for his magnum opus, he allowed the publication of his earliest treatise, divided into two separate small volumes (Human Nature, or the Fundamental Elements of Policie, and De corpore politico, or the Elements of Law, Moral and Politick). In 1651 he published his translation of the De Cive under the title of Philosophical Rudiments concerning Government and Society. Meanwhile the printing of the greater work was proceeding, and finally it appeared about the middle of 1651, under the title of Leviathan, or the Matter, Form and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil, with a famous frontpiece in which, from behind hills overlooking a landscape, there towered the body (above the waist) of a crowned giant, made up of tiny figures of human beings and bearing sword and crozier in the two hands.\n \n The work had immediate impact. Soon, Hobbes was more lauded and decried than any other thinker of his time. However, the first effect of its publication was to sever his link with the exiled royalists, forcing him to appeal to the revolutionary English government for protection. The exiles may very well have killed him; the secularist spirit of his book greatly angered both Anglicans and French Catholics. Hobbes fled back home, arriving in London in the winter of 1651. . . .\nWikipedia",

   "It appears that Jeronimus Cornelisz was mistakenly given heroic status because he had a hysterical panic attack and was too frightened to leave the sinking ship--the captain who goes down with his ship soft of thing--and duly elected leader of the foundering survivors.\n \n I wonder if a similar situation occurred in Germany when Hitler gained power there.\n \n At any rate, this offers an opportunity introduce the topic of Fuhrerprinzip, or blind obedience to authority, blind acceptance of a hierarchal power structure without asserting a democratic role for everyone. It seems to me that this principal, Fuhrerprinzip, slipped into place when American voters were panicked by a suspiciously timely threat from Osama bin Laden which was given enormous air play just before the election in November of 2004, not to mention the incessant rightwing rant that Osama bin Laden wanted to see John Kerry elected.\n \n And, I wonder about a possible link between Fuhrerprinzip and the unitary power philosophy of Samuel Alito.",
