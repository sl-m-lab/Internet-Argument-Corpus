   "Here we go again. As if the cap and trade legislation wasn't bad enough, now we have the UN sponsored Treaty of Copenhagen to contend with. Here's the article which explains it, a link to the repudiation of it and another link to the petition against america's involvement with it. To those who aren't already drunk on the leftist kool-aid, please sign the petition and let your voice be heard. And what, if anything, can we proponents of american sovereignty do to preserve our national independence before this marxist president just signs it away?\n \n Important Notice for America's Future\n The draft Treaty of Copenhagen, to be signed in mid-December 2009, would create an unelected world government with direct power over all financial and trading markets, and direct power to intervene over the heads of elected governments in the economic and environmental affairs of all nations that sign the Treaty. The word \"government\" actually appears in the Treaty as the first of three purposes of a huge, new, supranational bureaucratic entity that will have the power to require wealthier nations to redistribute up to 2% of their annual gross domestic product to third-world countries in imagined reparation for imaginary \"climate debt\" - and all this just as final scientific proof that CO2 has a tiny and harmless warming effect is available. Please sign the Instrument of Repudiation, and urge at least five of your friends to sign it too, and urge each of them to find five more to sign it. The Instrument will be tabled during the Copenhagen Conference this December. So sign now, and save America's freedom, democracy, and prosperity.  \n \n (Link to site) WEBCommentary - commentary, politics, news\n \n (Link to repudiation) http://www.webcommentary.com/images/climate/repudiation.pdf\n \n (Link to petition) Sign Repudiation Form\n \n Here's a video of Lord Monckton explaining the threat we americans face under this president.

   "This video: YouTube - Climate Change - Is CO2 the cause? - Pt 1 of 4 is the first in a series of 4 videos which show using \"scientific methods\" how CO2 is NOT the cause of global warming and the warmer trends which are being claimed are completely normal, and even to be expected. So the question must be, with opposing and rational evidence such as this video which is widely known and accepted by many scientists around the world, why would our president who is allegedly obligated to protecting our long term interests agree to sign this \"Treaty of Copenhagen\" in early december which commits 2% of our annual GDP to third world countries when we have the most modern and efficient environmental policies on earth today? \n \n And can anyone who defends Obama explain why the Kyoto Treaty demanded that we further decrease our emissions while the third world polluters who are the major contributors to world wide pollution are given a pass? Does that make any rational sense to anyone so that they can explain it to me? This is why our Government refused to sign Kyoto from GHW Bush, through Clintons Presidency and through the young Bush's 8 years in office. That's 20 years that the US refused to sign this bogus treaty with congressional approval due to its inequities. But notice that Obama never hesitated for a second before running to sign it in his first months in office. Why aren't the pro-environmental leftists who claim to be sincerely concerned for our world just ignoring these undeniable facts regarding the reality of what is happening here and of what their messiah actually represents?

   "by a scientist\n July 20, 2008\n \"The Viscount Monckton of Brenchley\" is full of XXXX himself. Before casting a wary eye on his new ribaldry, however, let me direct you to yet another dismantling of his \"thesis\" - this one by Deltoid at ScienceBlogs: \"Monckton's triple counting.\"\n \n But I digress. The Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, as he prefers to call himself, or TVMOB, as I will call him because, damn, the acronym is just too sweet, has penned an epistle to the president of the American Physical Society, which you can peruse here. \n \n TVMOB is displeased with the new APS disclaimer on his article: \"The following article has not undergone any scientific peer review. Its conclusions are in disagreement with the overwhelming opinion of the world scientific community. The Council of the American Physical Society disagrees with this article's conclusions.\"\n \n TVMOB writes, \"This seems discourteous.\" You see, TVMOB holds the view that peer review occurs if his article gets suggested edits by a co-editor who happens to be a scientist.\n \n Let me not make the obvious point that being edited by an editor ain't scientific peer review. You can read the editor's requested edits on page 2 of TVMOB's letter. Anybody who has actually been peer-reviewed will note that the proposed edits aren't anything close to what a peer-reviewed set of comments looks like, especially for an analysis as flawed as this one.\n\n Irony-gate: Viscount Monckton, a British peer, says his paper was peer-reviewed by a scientist.

   "Also, let's not get sidetracked or derailed from the facts being raised and questioned here. This president has already signed a treaty the previous 3 presidents have refused to sign due to the obvious inequities they saw in it. That Treaty, (Kyoto) demands that we do even more than we are already doing as a nation regarding emission controls while it gives the major polluters on earth a pass for the next 25 years. \n \n If the goal of the treaty was really to actually clean the planets air and decrease CO2 emissions, there is no way that treaty would read like that. It simply makes no sense at all. The greatest monetary resources should be spent on modernizing the industrial stacks with buffers and collectors so the third world can continue to produce without polluting at levels that the west did during the middle 20th century before this buffer technology existed. It must also be noted that we who are being punished as the largest polluter single handedly created/invented some of the earliest clean air technology. \n \n And why didn't simone comment on the Copenhagen Treaty which Obama will sign in about 36 days? By attacking Monckton does that mean she is defending Obama and the repercussions of what that Treaty will mean for each and every american as we lose our sovereignty to a one world government forever more? Does that scare the liberals at all? Can't they see that they are endorsing the proposition that their own children will grow up in a very different country than they did? With very different rights and freedoms than we have enjoyed. Is it setting in finally that the changes that Obama promised us are changes we never wanted or expected?\n \n And now he wants to bail out the Newspaper industry; liberal ones only of course. And as a 501-c so they can copy the NPR format of government mouthpiece. But that wont bother the leftists here who only see it as benefiting their agenda. Obama open to newspaper bailout bill - The Hill's Blog Briefing Room But here's my problem with it. I remember very clearly when most every home had one, and every office in america had a typewriter on every desk. During the 80s they started to disappear in favor of word processors. A Brief History of Typing, Typists, Sex and the Typewriter\n \n I remember when the largest manufacturer of manual typewriters went out of business, a company that had been in business since the 20s I believe. And at this time during the 80s many old and well established companies were bought up, redesigned, or went out of business as products went hi-tech and left them in the annals of business history. I remember clearly feeling fear and apprehension at how fast the world was changing and how many industries were going under. What is different from now and then is that we had the confidence in capitalism to believe that the workers in those antiquated industries would learn new skills and we as a society would move forward with a truly progressive economy and lifestyle as americans who have always been innovative leaders who invent tomorrows products today. And that is exactly what happened, and if you remember, this was the Reagan years. Some of the greatest economic growth in the 20th century. Especially as opposed to the 21% prime interest rate we suffered under when the democrat Carter was president. \n \n But by saving companies that can no longer sustain themselves in a forward moving economy, we are stifling growth and creativity by forcing ourselves to sustain the old and weak instead chasing the new advancements if only we are allowed to perform as we have. So why would this marxist who claims to be a progressive, stifle new growth by even considering to prop up a failing industry which can no longer support itself? If people aren't buying newspapers, doesn't that mean that enough people are getting their info online through computers and smart phones? So why in the world would we consider spending good money on an industry which nobody is using anymore? And does anyone call such a president a true progressive? Not if they want to be honest they don't. So let's not lose sight of what this thread is about, shall we?\n \nHere we go again. As if the cap and trade legislation wasn't bad enough, now we have the UN sponsored Treaty of Copenhagen to contend with. Here's the article which explains it, a link to the repudiation of it and another link to the petition against america's involvement with it.

The verse I posted above refutes that assumption. If we as a world rejected the road we are going down right now and fulfilled 2 Chronicles 7:14, then the coming holocaust could be avoided. That means it isn't predetermination. But humanity wont change its nature and greed as well as the drive for the hidden elite to attain individual power over the masses will drive this rush toward personal destruction as a world order, spiritually speaking.\n \n \n In order for this global environmental policy to make sense, you would first have to believe in anthropogenic warming. Until you do, we can stop right there. \n\n \n Isn't that precisely where the advocates are positioned in this debate? And isn't this exactly where the two sides disagree on the issue? They believe man made pollution is the cause of global warming and my side rejects that premise and believes we are in a natural and very explainable cycle, so there is no justification for the over reaction of attempting to buy our way out of this problem as if a transfer of wealth has ever fixed an ecological problem. Because any rational person knows it can't be done. We can't change mother nature by transferring our wealth to the third world so this is just a massive scam.\n \n \n The rest is just paranoid hype. The treaty has little chance of passing, which many world and environmental leaders have agreed on in the last few days. The reason...to many people are more concerned about how it will effect their own wallets rather than how inaction will effect the environment. It almost seems to me that you are pulling out a rediculous \"you will bring about the end of the world\" guilt trip here. I find that sad. \n Amen...\n\n \n Really? I wish you had posted a link to an objective source which says this, because I am unaware that the world leaders with the authority to sign it are against it. I absolutely hope you are right though, but I have no confidence that our president wont rush to the table to sign this Treaty of Copenhagen and give away our american sovereignty without even putting up a fight. \n \n So feel free to shut me up right now and put this thread to bed by showing that Obama and the leaders of most countries have stated that they wont sign this UN based Treaty. I welcome that evidence and will be very happy to be proven that my concerns are unfounded and based in a paranoid and irrational fear of what I believe this president is capable of doing. \n \n And if you'll note, I never made the correlation between this Treaty and the \"biblical one world government prophecies,\" I just responded to and agreed with Bassman's assertion that the end result of this Treaty does play right into the prophecies regarding the end of this age. I think its sad that you consider that fear mongering rather than ask yourself what insights these ancients hebrews had which allowed them to so accurately foresee what is now occurring in the world today.",

   "It is a good thing. But why must we destroy the earth and 2/3rds of humanity to accomplish it? That is the downside to the end of the age saga which is coming. You can liken it to when God poured out the plagues on Egypt because Pharaoh refused to free His people. That event will be repeated again, only on a world wide basis. And it will be in response to antichrists actions against His people. \n\n What is this \"we\" stuff? Got a mouse in your pocket? I thought god was going to destroy it...not \"we\". \n \n \nAll I am trying to tell you is that we, as human beings could avoid that judgement by humbling ourselves before God just as He has promised us, here: \n 2Ch 7:14 if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.\n \n \n The only person who is arguing for predetermination around here is you. The verse I posted above refutes that assumption. If we as a world rejected the road we are going down right now and fulfilled 2 Chronicles 7:14, then the coming holocaust could be avoided. That means it isn't predetermination. But humanity wont change its nature and greed as well as the drive for the hidden elite to attain individual power over the masses will drive this rush toward personal destruction as a world order, spiritually speaking.\n\n But the prophecy is written....remember? It doesn't say \"this might happen\", it says it will happen. Sounds like predetermination to me. Either that or an ambiguous few sentences is being pulled from a ficional book and applied to a current situation based on the fact that they loosely correlate in order to attempt a political/economic influence. \n \n \nIsn't that precisely where the advocates are positioned in this debate? And isn't this exactly where the two sides disagree on the issue? They believe man made pollution is the cause of global warming and my side rejects that premise and believes we are in a natural and very explainable cycle, so there is no justification for the over reaction of attempting to buy our way out of this problem as if a transfer of wealth has ever fixed an ecological problem. Because any rational person knows it can't be done. We can't change mother nature by transferring our wealth to the third world so this is just a massive scam.\n\n Nobody is attempting to \"change mother earth\". If anything, people would like mother earth to not change. Even if you don't believe in \"man-made global warming\", don't you at least support the fight against pollution? Don't you think god would rather have a less polluted earth?\n \n \n http://www.globalclimatescam.com/documents/un-fccc-copenhagen-2009.pdf\n Here is the actual text of the draft. Would you care to quote the parts that actually do all the scary things you claim it does? I read it, did you? I saw nothing about us ceeding US sovereignty. Sounds like you and the other AWG deniers are simply using scare tactics. I guess you didn't count on people actually reading the document. \n \n Also, keep in mind that this is a draft, and will be scaled down and changed greatly before it is ever signed at all. That is what the whole meeting in Copenhagen will be about. \n \n \nWe will no longer countenance the fraudulent, unscientific, now-discredited Superstition that is Climate Change, in that the warming that carbon dioxide induces is now proven small, harmless, and beneficial;\n http://www.webcommentary.com/images/climate/repudiation.pdf\n \n\n emoticon_wow\n LOL. Beneficial? Yeah, because the earth was doing so poorly until we came along and polluted it...now things couldn't be better. Go team!",

   "I'm not trying to be argumentative, \n\n \n Right! you're not trying to be argumentative. We'll just have to wait until the final draft is written and the facts are revealed to see if my concerns are justified. As I said though, let's not get sidetracked.\n \n \nAlso, let's not get sidetracked or derailed from the facts being raised and questioned here. This president has already signed a treaty the previous 3 presidents have refused to sign due to the obvious inequities they saw in it. That Treaty, (Kyoto) demands that we do even more than we are already doing as a nation regarding emission controls while it gives the major polluters on earth a pass for the next 25 years. \n \n If the goal of the treaty was really to actually clean the planets air and decrease CO2 emissions, there is no way that treaty would read like that. It simply makes no sense at all. The greatest monetary resources should be spent on modernizing the industrial stacks with buffers and collectors so the third world can continue to produce without polluting at levels that the west did during the middle 20th century before this buffer technology existed. It must also be noted that we who are being punished as the largest polluter single handedly created/invented some of the earliest clean air technology. \n \n And why didn't simone comment on the Copenhagen Treaty which Obama will sign in about 36 days? By attacking Monckton does that mean she is defending Obama and the repercussions of what that Treaty will mean for each and every american as we lose our sovereignty to a one world government forever more? Does that scare the liberals at all? Can't they see that they are endorsing the proposition that their own children will grow up in a very different country than they did? With very different rights and freedoms than we have enjoyed. Is it setting in finally that the changes that Obama promised us are changes we never wanted or expected?\n \n And now he wants to bail out the Newspaper industry; liberal ones only of course. And as a 501-c so they can copy the NPR format of government mouthpiece. But that wont bother the leftists here who only see it as benefiting their agenda. Obama open to newspaper bailout bill - The Hill's Blog Briefing Room But here's my problem with it. I remember very clearly when most every home had one, and every office in america had a typewriter on every desk. During the 80s they started to disappear in favor of word processors. A Brief History of Typing, Typists, Sex and the Typewriter\n \n I remember when the largest manufacturer of manual typewriters went out of business, a company that had been in business since the 20s I believe. And at this time during the 80s many old and well established companies were bought up, redesigned, or went out of business as products went hi-tech and left them in the annals of business history. I remember clearly feeling fear and apprehension at how fast the world was changing and how many industries were going under. What is different from now and then is that we had the confidence in capitalism to believe that the workers in those antiquated industries would learn new skills and we as a society would move forward with a truly progressive economy and lifestyle as americans who have always been innovative leaders who invent tomorrows products today. And that is exactly what happened, and if you remember, this was the Reagan years. Some of the greatest economic growth in the 20th century. Especially as opposed to the 21% prime interest rate we suffered under when the democrat Carter was president. \n \n But by saving companies that can no longer sustain themselves in a forward moving economy, we are stifling growth and creativity by forcing ourselves to sustain the old and weak instead chasing the new advancements, if only we are allowed to perform as we have in the past. So why would this marxist who claims to be a progressive, stifle new growth by even considering to prop up a failing industry which can no longer support itself and is quickly becoming outdated if not to further secure his own political security by transforming the written press into tools for leftist propaganda? If people aren't buying newspapers, doesn't that mean that enough people are getting their info online through computers and smart phones? So why in the world would we consider spending good money on an industry which nobody is using anymore? And does anyone call such a president a true progressive? Not if they want to be honest they don't. So let's not lose sight of what this thread is about, shall we?\n",
