   "I may be entering dangerous waters here, but the thread on the premature 22 week birth made me think of an interesting issue. Namely, if a living human embryo/fetus (prior to gaining a mental existence) exists outside of his mother, then should it be always given a chance at life (assuming that chance at life does not force any woman to carry it against her will)? \n \n I think we all agree that the 22 week old premature baby should be allowed to continue to grow. However, the situation I have in mind is that of embryos that are produced during in-vitro fertilizations, where there is very often more than one embryo produced and only one is used to implant in the woman in question who sought the in-vitro fertilization to begin with. So, what is done with those extra embryos? My understanding is that they are currently kept frozen. Perhaps many or most are even destroyed. These embryos may be just barely developed - i.e. just a few cells, but they are part way toward growth into a full human. \n \n So, the question is, for an embryo that would otherwise be destroyed, if someone else were to offer to take it on, carry it to term and keep it, should the biological mother have any right to deny that (assuming she has no plans to carry it to term herself)? Essentially, this is a question about the value judgement between that fetus with its potential to become a full human and the rights of the mother to reserve for herself only the rights to her biological offspring (a type of right of possession over her genetic progeny). I have mixed feelings but would like to hear from others first. I can try to explain this further if it is not clear.",

   "The invitro fertilization problem has always been a giant gaping sucking hole in the pro-life belief system. \n \n Before implantation, many of the embroys are tested for specific diease related genes. Those embryos are not selected for implantation. Often those go one of two ways: To science for research and eventually disposal or directly to disposal unless the client wants them frozen, in which they contract a third party for cold storage. Furthermore, the process involves implanting a large amount of embryos to ensure pregnancy, sometimes this ranges up to 25 different embryos and often time all 25 don't implant and are lost. \n \n There is a big fat problem here as one can see. If a embryo in a woman is a potential baby and abortion is therefore murdering it, then Invitro through its very processes is mudering millions of potential humans. But when was the last time you've seen a pro-lifer argue invitro fertilization was murder?",

I personally think that value increases as you get closer to the state of mental existence because probability of becoming a person also increases as you get closer to reaching mental existence. For example, the unfertilized egg has very little value despite the fact that it ALSO has the potential of becoming a full human, but that potential is quite small since it would need the unlikely added occurence of fertilization to occur. The embryo (typical just an undiscernable bunch of cells at that point) has gone through fertilization but it is still very far from reaching mental existence and its probablility of reaching it (successfully being implanted and growing to third term) are relatively small. That 22 week old premie is very close to reaching mental existence and has a very high probability of reaching it so its value is much larger.\n \n The only reason I bring up relative value of pre-mental existence fetuses/embryos/zygotes/eggs, is that the state may weigh the relative values of that fetus or embryo against other factors. In this example, the weight was the value of the embryo vs. the mother's right to possession of her genetic progeny. This is a value judgement and I personally think that, in that case, the value of the embryo in its potential to become a full person outweighs the mother's rights to her genetic progeny (unless she chooses to carry that embryo herself - she should get priority). \n \n In the case of the 22 week old, its value was much higher and I, personally, couldn't think of any reason for the mother to kill it that would have weighed in higher than the value of that fetus. Indeed, I can't think of any reason why the state would want to use it for other reasons where those reasons would outweigh its value as a near-person. So, I saw no valid reason for it to be killed.\n \n However, where the embryonic stem cell debate is concerned, there the state balances the value of the embryo with its fairly low chance of becoming a full human with its value for scientific research into cures for diseases that can save many lives. In that value judgement, I would lean toward allowing the embryonic stem cells to be used for the research.",

   "The pro-choice movement is propelled by the religion of secular humanism (generally speaking although there might be some exceptions). Secular humanism preaches that there is no god, and even if there were one could not know it (an argument that is rooted in blind faith), and that everything came about by chance.\n\n \n No, you're version of Secular Humanism does that. What Secular humanism actually teaches is quite different. I suggest you start learning what it is, especially focusing on its origins in the Enlightenment. Your unfounded (and quite historically wrong) beliefs are showing. Furthermore, evolution does not deal with the origin of life. And science as a whole has not made any claims as to the existance or disexistance of a Diety or set of Dieties. Please get your facts straight before posting.\n \n \nTherefore it would follow that mankind is nothing more then an abnormal wart on the face of a chance universe who has no purpose or dignity whatsoever - everything is meaningless (I still have not figured out why these meaningless people post meaningless words on a meaningless internet forum).\n\n \n That would be true if your version of secular humanism was the actual. As it is not, your asseration is based upon what amounts to a fabrication. Furthermore, merely because we may have arrived here by chance does not rob us of dignity nor value. Value is created (VAT anyone?). Therefore as value can be created, a universe of chance can result in a universe of chance AND value. Furthermore, life's meaning is up to each person. Some derive that through religion. Others through work. Others through however they choose. Merely because one does not drink your kool-aid does not make their lives meaningless. Only the truly nihilistic believe that and very, very, very few people would classify under that label. \n \n \nThis religion\n\n \n Again, I made a point about using a dictionary. Please follow this advice. \n \n \nand all the sects that branch off from it, has no basis to place any dignity in the human being whatsoever.\n\n \n Uh...unfounded asseration based upon a fabrication and IMO quite a sad view on life. If meaning is derived from God, then why aren't we just worshipping all day? But then again, I value people like MLK and Edison over religious terrorists. But that's just me. You clearly value islamic suicide bombers the same as the greatest inventors of Human History. \n \n \nAnd since in general people form their beliefs partly from religion, there is no question that religious beliefs is the driving force for the pro-choice argument.\n\n \n You said partly. Where is your proof that the other part is not the cause? Religion has no economic forcasting data. I draw my pro-choice beliefs directly from that. Therefore you are wrong merely by my existance.\n \n \nIt may not be politically correct to say this as it may be taken as one group forcing their religious beliefs on others, hence most pro-choicers wont even touch the religious aspect with a ten foot pole.\n\n \n Your basic assumption is faulty. I have 15 marbles in a bag. Some are red, some are blue. Can you absolutely say that if you pull 3 out of the bag, all are red?\n \n \nNow, what I can't for the life of me understand is why anyone would choose to listen to those who have no basis for placing dignity in the human being try to make a call on issues of ethics and morality.\n\n \n Again with the assumptions. Merely because one doesn't drink the kool-aid doesn't mean they don't value human life or have any dignity in it. You make a huge amount of completely unfounded assumptions. \n \n \nIt makes sense that those who, due to their chosen faith based religion, can find no basis for the sacredness of human life would have a problem comprehending a view that says that human life is sacred and all people should be treated with dignity and respect.\n\n \n I find it sad that you derive all value from your religion.\n \n All people should be treated with dignity and respect? Would you treat suicide bombers with respect? how about the snipers that are picking off civilian workers in Iraq? How about the 19 9/11 hijackers?\n \n People must earn respect. It should NEVER be freely given. You are a Communist\n \n \nYou are worth far more than dirt and trees. Simple observation of nature testifies to this.\n\n \n If you say so. \n \n You're currently ignoring a very large amount of points I have made\n \n I suspect you don't actually believe your arguments. If you did you'd admit you value people like MLK over terrorists, but that would contridict your Communist ideas.\n \n Funny how that works out. A Communist, Terrorist Supporting Christian.",

This makes no sense as you obviously think one person is above the next. The person above is not really above if they have equal rights. I think what really is happening here is that you are taking the value of a person to more than what it means. A hard worker is more valuable as worker than a poor worker...I wouldn't say the poor worker is less valuable as a human though.

My point with value is that if you value all humans the same then you realize that humans come with rights and thus if you value humans the same they get the same set of rights.\n\n I suspect that there are various levels of values that we are speaking of then. \n 1) There are the values that we place in people just because they are people (or, in your case, just because they are humans- i.e. unique life forms with a full set of human DNA). I suppose that is the type of value that I place under my view of equal rights and laws for people. The criminal can suffer just as terribly as the saint, or the beggar suffer just as terribly as the rich man, under similar torment or unfair treatment. If I understand you correctly, this is the type of value that you are talking about except that, for you, it starts at conception and has no relation to ability to suffer, empathy, etc.\n \n 2) There are the values we place in people for what they are - in their inherited differences that are not in their control. Examples of inherited differences for which it is culturally acceptable to discriminate in treatment include differences in attractiveness and differences in intelligence. Examples of inherited differences for which it is not acceptable to discriminate are differences in race or sex. It is apparently a controversion issue whether it is acceptable to discriminate based on sexual orientation (partly a controversy whether this is a trait outside of the person's control and whether it should be considered bad to begin with).\n \n 3) There are the values we place in people for what they do. For examples, criminals have behaved so badly that our laws are set up to restrict their rights. Lazy people are less respected than hard working people (to a point). Generally successfull people are more respected than less successful people of the same inherent capabilities. \n \n Anyway, you might see that there are various levels of value that one might place in people.

A black man is as equal value to a white man holding all things constant. A black man who commits serial murders is less of value then the average white guy on the street. Race is merely a slight variation of specific genes. There's no evidence to conclude that these variations make any race 'better' then another. There are specific people that have specific types of genes that would make them better the other people of other races without these genes in certain situtations, such as having sickle cell anemia in malaria infested areas, but that is a specific situation.

You can assign rights equally if you place a different inherent value on humans. It just doesn't make sense.\n\n In some cases it makes sense and in others it doesn't. You have to have valid, justifiable and supportable reasons to value people differently in a particular situation and to discriminate based on that value. If you don't have a valid, justifiable and supportable reason, then discrimination is unjust. For example, your people that get a 1200 SAT and 3.4GPA get into University Steve not because they are overall superior people but because they are superior in their academic skills and qualifications - which is what is relevant to getting into University Steve. One of the unqualified people might be a much better parent, or a much better golf player - skills that are superior for the situation of parenthood or professional golf but which are irrelevant for getting into that University. \n \n There are a wide variety of rights - some which should apply to all equally and some which depend on the situation and the people involved. As I said earlier, companies are not allowed to discriminate based on race or sex but are allowed to discriminate based on qualifications. This makes sense based on supportable reasons. However, what reason would one give for having different laws on theft, for example, for blacks vs whites - assuming that everything else is the same (ex. they are both first offenders)? I don't see any valid reason. The same is true for differences in wealth, sex, etc. If there is no justifiable supportable reason, then one cannot discriminate.\n \n You say that there is a difference betweeen natural and legal rights. Perhaps you could clarify what you mean by this.\n \nOk, well, perhaps some just think you are inferior because your skin is different. This doesn't make much sense to you but ranking humans on intelligence or money doesn't make much sense to me. \n\n Nobody has been able to present a valid, supportable, justifiable reason to value based on skin color. Sure, there have been a lot of reasons put out there, but those haven't been justifiable for applying to all people of dark skin color (ex. it is illogical and invalid to claim an entire people deserve a certain treatment because of a few bad apples). However, intelligence often does make a big difference in various situations - mainly in a wide range of jobs - so it is justifiable to value people based on intelligence where jobs are concerned. Most employers realize that intelligence is not the only criteria (there are intelligent people who might be very lazy or disorganized). However, I see no justifiable reason to have one set of laws against, say, theft by an intelligent person vs by a stupid person. So, I repeat myself - if there are valid, supportable, justifiable reasons to place various values in a situation and discriminate based on those values, then that discrimination is just.\n \nJustified by what and whom? Explain to me how Eugenics was nothing more than a devaluing of certain humans and forcing them to do things that were clearly unjust. \n\n Well, give me the reasons that were presented to justify Eugenics, and I will explain whether or not those reasons are logical and supportable.

This means that people's actions can determine how they are treated.\n \n 2) You would not give children and the severely mentally incapacitated all the same rights as the rest of us enjoy. For example, you would not allow them to wander around wherever they wish. This means that there are some inherent properties in people which restrict their rights compared to other people.\n \n Those are at least two examples where, I think, you agree that it is ok to treat some people differently than others. \n \n Perhaps my lack of unuderstanding comes from my assumption that, if you think that people are equally valued, then they would be treated equally. Is that assumption wrong? Specifically, do you say that all people should be TREATED equally? If not, then where does VALUE come into the picture? Is it just an abstract concept that has no effect in the reality of people's lives?\n\n I'm going to answer this briefly as I don't have much time but you can ask for further explanations if you want.\n \n 1)Treatment is not the same as value...one doesn't follow from the other\n \n 2)Same thing here but I would like to say that care for the mentally ill is to give them more rights then they would normally have.\n \n Finally value does not imply equal treatment or anything like that...it just implies that with an inherent value comes inherent rights. Value does not change but we certainly take away inherent rights as a form of punishment.",

Value does not change but we certainly take away inherent rights as a form of punishment.\n\n If I understand you correctly, equal value leads to equal rights but not necessarily equal treatment. For example, people who commit crimes have certain rights taken away as a punishment. \n \n What about those mentally ill? They have not necessarily committed any acts that would lead to their rights being taken away as punishment. You say that \"care for the mentally ill is to give them more rights then they would normally have\". What does this mean? I thought they had the same rights as we all have - including rights to freedom of movement, etc. Mental institutions seem to restrict their freedom of movement, etc. How, in your view, are they INCREASING their rights? Namely, what rights would they \"normally have\" and what rights are added by such mental institutions?\n \n Also, I am still not clear which rights are inherent and which are not. For example, it is ok to discriminate in employment based on qualifications, but not on race or sex. Similarly, it is ok to discriminate as a landlord based on a person's demonstrated responsibiltiy and financial status but not on race, sex, etc. These are apparently not inherent rights. Presumably, the right against being killed is an inherent right. How about the right aginst having one's property stolen? We, on the pro-choice side, believe that the right to one's own body is an inherent right. Apparently, you disagree.",

Reality has shown us that much if not most of the time, that would not be true. The people who behave so generously would be exploited or killed nonetheless and their noble approach would only serve to make the enemy's task easier. It depends on the enemy, but there are too many examples in history of nations distorting the image of their enemies that no reality on that enemies side would change their view. For example, Hitler and the Nazis demonized the Jews to gain support for the attrocities committed against them. Relatively few Jewish people fought back but they were massacred nonetheless. I have heard that this lack of action on the part of the Jewish people during World War II was partly because the stories of attrocities were so well hidden (few who experienced them survived to pass them on at the time) and because of assumptions that the Germans would never be so barbaric.

However, even there, after some thought, I did think up a couple of scenarious where people's situations or beliefs might blur the moral picture. For example, during previous times of monarchy, sometimes civil wars were prevented by killing off the heirs to the throne of the competing faction since the opposition would continue to fight as long as there existed a viable monarch to install. If the death of one child (an heir to the throne) would have prevented a war that kills thousands, then the moral picture gets muddied. Also, certain ancient American cultures - ex. Incas and Aztecs - sacrificed innocents to their sun god because they REALLY believed that the sun god needed human sacrifices to keep the cycle of night and day going. I don't know if this included children, but it might have. We find these practices horrendous but part of that reasoning is that we know that such human sacrifices have nothing to do with the cycle of day and night continuing. Imagine, though, a bizarre scenario where that would be necessary (i.e. this is what these people actually believed their reality was) - the moral picture would then get muddied. Overall, I simply think it would be very hard if not impossible to think of a moral scenario in which EVERYONE would agree. \n \nI don't know that I would agree with you here.

People who exploit others (even in simple situations at work, where ego and territoriality is concerned) are selfish and, though they might acknowledge the kindness, would probably not reciprocate it. I am sure that there are situations in which it helps but, where selfish or very stubborn people are concerned (and there are a tremendous amount out there), I don't think it makes much of a difference.",

   "If I understand you correctly, equal value leads to equal rights but not necessarily equal treatment. For example, people who commit crimes have certain rights taken away as a punishment. \n \n What about those mentally ill? They have not necessarily committed any acts that would lead to their rights being taken away as punishment. You say that \"care for the mentally ill is to give them more rights then they would normally have\". What does this mean? I thought they had the same rights as we all have - including rights to freedom of movement, etc. Mental institutions seem to restrict their freedom of movement, etc. How, in your view, are they INCREASING their rights? Namely, what rights would they \"normally have\" and what rights are added by such mental institutions?\n \n Also, I am still not clear which rights are inherent and which are not. For example, it is ok to discriminate in employment based on qualifications, but not on race or sex. Similarly, it is ok to discriminate as a landlord based on a person's demonstrated responsibiltiy and financial status but not on race, sex, etc. These are apparently not inherent rights. Presumably, the right against being killed is an inherent right. How about the right aginst having one's property stolen? We, on the pro-choice side, believe that the right to one's own body is an inherent right. Apparently, you disagree.\n\n \n This got shuffled back a bit.\n \n As for the first part, not exactly. Not all rights are even equally. A right to vote is a right but certainly not a natural one.\n \n Second, you obviously haven't been around many mentally ill patients. Many of them don't have the capacity to take advantage of rights they might normally have. You give them the best care possible and allow them as many freedoms and rights as possible without risking the loss of more rights to themselves. Children work the same way. A child doesn't have free movement. This makes me believe that this is not really a natural right. A parent is the guardian of the child and makes decisions for this child. A guardian can make all these decisions until it hits a natural right and then it is disallowed...for example the child can't be beaten or killed. \n \n In your third paragraph none of the ones mentioned are natural rights. The right to \"ones own body\" is not exactly a natural right when you say it like that. But lets assume it is a natural right for the sake of argument. This would present a \"conflict\" of rights some might say. The \"right not to have another live off of you\". The being inside still would have a right to life though. So which side wins? I'd say a right to life wins in that situation every time. In any other situation you would probably agree with this assessment given the above statements. For example, make the following assumptions: 1) you have a right life 2) you have a right to your own body\n That is all.\n \n If in a plane that has a weight limit and you find out person X is also in there thus causing the weight to be over limit then at this point Person Y's body is endangered. In fact, you could go further and say there is a 100% chance that if they land the plane the damage will be that Person Y will lose an arm and this is the only damage to come. So does person Y have the moral option to kick person X out of the plane, obviously making person X no more. For this example assume that person X had no idea how he ended up in the plane in the first place (ie he magically appeared there).",

For this example assume that person X had no idea how he ended up in the plane in the first place (ie he magically appeared there).\n\n We both agree that rights start at SOME point - a point where we each think that a person or human (or any living entity worthy of rights) starts. Before that point, neither of us allocates rights. You choose the point of conception - perhaps because that is when a second set of DNA gets added and when the growth process starts (I don't know what other changes you consider important) - and I choose the onset of mental existence. We each have our reasons for choosing those transitions to define when rights exist and we each consider the other's choice arbitrary. However, I do think we agree that, once those rights start, then one does weigh that right to life with the right over one's own body and we are actually in agreement that the right to life should outweigh the right to one's own body in that situation of pregnancy. I allow for exceptions for risk to the mother's life or health (where, admittedly, I do not have a good feel where to place limits on that health exception). I think you allow for some exceptions as well, but am not sure which ones.\n \n What about other situations? In your plane with persons X and Y, it looks like they are both in equal situations - either one lives or the other lives. This is similar to the lifeboat scenario that I once mentioned to you - a scenario I learned in Confirmation class. It is one of those moral dillemas that has no comfortable answer. One can draw lots, or ask for volunteers, or hope for a miracle - none are morally comfortable options. If, in this case, as you say, instead of risking death, the only thing risked is an arm (or both people's arms), then I would say that both should survive and essentially sacrifice their arms so that the other can live. Either way, it seems that you were using this as an analogy for the mother being Y and the fetus being X. This only works if both are people with rights. Again, I do not consider merely a body without a mind (i.e. a pre-mentally existing fetus) as being a person with rights just like you don't consider an unfertilized egg (an pre-fertilized zygote) as being a person with rights.\n \n In the general sense, there is the question of whether one person can expect another person to support them against their will - as in the violinist scenario where the supporting person gets taken from the street and attached to a violinist against their will. With such situations, where weighing two rights are concerned, I often fall back on my moral stance of treating others as I would expect myself to be treated. I would think it very unfair of me to expect a total stranger to completely ruin their life to support mine against their will. If they did agree to it, then I think they have no right to reneg on the agreement once it is too late. A real life scenario might be if I needed an organ transplant to live where only very few people could supply it (and only one is discovered). This assumes that one can transplant that organ without major health reprecussions on the other person. I don't think I have the right to forcibly take that organ from them, despite the fact that I would die without it. They would have to agree. However, if they agreed, then they cannot reneg on that agreement after it becomes to late for met to find someone else.\n \n I actually thought of another interesting moral scenario. Imagine that you were on the Titanic and you were lucky enough to get on the last lifeboat. However, now,there are many desperate people in the water who are trying desperately to get on your boat to live. You know that, if you let all those people on who want to get on, then the boat will sink and all will die. Do you prevent them from getting on - thus taking an action that kills them? Anyway, as you see, moral dilemmas are not easy.",

The only point I was making here was that even if a so called \"right to ones body existed\" the fact that a right to life trumps renders that rights useless in our discussions. Once again the question becomes when do you value and not who has a higher value upon who.\n \n As for health exceptions...I wouldn't allow any but life of a mother is different. \n \n\n What about other situations? In your plane with persons X and Y, it looks like they are both in equal situations - either one lives or the other lives. \nNo, they both would live if they land...just one has minus an arm.\n \n \nEither way, it seems that you were using this as an analogy for the mother being Y and the fetus being X. This only works if both are people with rights. Again, I do not consider merely a body without a mind (i.e. a pre-mentally existing fetus) as being a person with rights just like you don't consider an unfertilized egg (an pre-fertilized zygote) as being a person with rights.\n As I said earlier..this is irrelevant to our discussion as we were discussing which right would be above another (assuming both are rights and assuming both people are people).\n \n\n In the general sense, there is the question of whether one person can expect another person to support them against their will - as in the violinist scenario where the supporting person gets taken from the street and attached to a violinist against their will. With such situations, where weighing two rights are concerned, I often fall back on my moral stance of treating others as I would expect myself to be treated. I would think it very unfair of me to expect a total stranger to completely ruin their life to support mine against their will. If they did agree to it, then I think they have no right to reneg on the agreement once it is too late. A real life scenario might be if I needed an organ transplant to live where only very few people could supply it (and only one is discovered). This assumes that one can transplant that organ without major health reprecussions on the other person. I don't think I have the right to forcibly take that organ from them, despite the fact that I would die without it. They would have to agree. However, if they agreed, then they cannot reneg on that agreement after it becomes to late for met to find someone else.\nThe organ example doesn't apply but the violinist is a good example. Lets assume the violinist didn't even know he/she would be put in that situation...he was forced to. Now removal would kill this violinist. Is it ethical to detach? I'd say no...even though the situation stinks for both parties. Saying the violinist made a choice to be attached doesn't exactly apply to abortion very well by the way.\n \n \nI actually thought of another interesting moral scenario. Imagine that you were on the Titanic and you were lucky enough to get on the last lifeboat. However, now,there are many desperate people in the water who are trying desperately to get on your boat to live. You know that, if you let all those people on who want to get on, then the boat will sink and all will die. Do you prevent them from getting on - thus taking an action that kills them? Anyway, as you see, moral dilemmas are not easy.\nthis one also doesn't apply to abortion as it is weighing the life of some over the life of others. These are hard questions but the one that is not hard is the life of one over the comfort of another...and you even agree with this.",

That suggests that it is such an extreme difference in the two rights that one wins by a landslide. I don't agree. I think right to life of mentally existing beings takes precedence in the situation of pregnancy but it doesn't win by a landslide. \n \n In judging one right against another, I mainly fall back to my moral stance of treating others as I would have myself be treated. In doing that, I usually try to look at a balance of suffering. For example, in a pregnancy in the third trimester, if the pregnancy was going to cause the woman torturous pain, then I would probably allow the abortion (assuming Cesarian section or other such procedures which also save the fetus would be out). This would fall under the exception of risk to woman's health. The great majority of pregnancies cause some physical difficulties on the woman and, if they are unwanted, psychological ones as well, but not nearly so much that they would outweigh a mentally existing fetus's right to life, in my view.

   "self-defense in threat of death is allowable. However, I specifically said threat of death was not present. \n\n It is not only threat of death that justifies self-defense but threat of great bodily harm. Quoting from the first web site I found under a Google search ( http://www.lectlaw.com/def/d030.htm ): \"Force likely to cause death or great bodily harm is justified in self-defense only if a person reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm.\" Torture certainly counts as great bodily harm. \n \nI'd be ticked off too but I wouldn't be mad at the person that received the kidney.

The first paragraph dealing with self-defense parrallels some of those issues.\n \n None of the arguements presented gets around the idea that rights start at SOME point because people start at SOME point, where there is some transition that changes life that is not a person into a person - we don't just spontaneously appear out of non-life.

I do not have clear outlines established and would be open to hearing people's ideas, but a general trend would be that minor health problems (such as changed metabolism, or normal-level childbirth pains) would not be enough whereas large health problems (paralysis, torturous pain, severe heart trouble, etc.) would be enough of a reason.

I would generally agree, though I accept abortion as a responsible choice up to the point of the fetus becoming a person.

This refers to the violinist scenario where the person grabbed off the street has no such responsibility whereas a woman who chooses sex does carry responsilbility for the outcome. With the violinist scenario, again I refer to my \"treat others as I would expect myself to be treated\" approach and could not expect a completely random stranger who did nothing to earn that responsibility to sacrifice so much for the sake of my life if I were in that violinist scenario.

In the case of rape, the guilt for the death of the fetus would ultimately lie with the rapist. However, with rape, I have mixed feelings for third trimester abortions since, if the woman waited until the third trimester, then once again she is essentially agreeing to keeping the fetus. I would lean toward having the rape victim stick to the same exceptions as everyone else where third trimester abortions (abortions of mentally existing people) are concerned.",
