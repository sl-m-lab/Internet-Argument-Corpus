   "Chris Benoit was a wrestler who this weekend was found dead with his wife and kid. The police are investigating this as a double murder-suicide.\n \n http://http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2003560001-2007290278,00.html\n \n Now as far as wrestlers go he was one of my favourites. So my question for you is this, how do you feel about people who you respect who then do terrible things?\n \n Does this terrible action remove any admiration for his other achievements?\n \n Should I simple refer to him as a great wrestler who did a terrible thing?\n \n Perhaps I should just respect deeds and not the person?\n \n Chris Benoit is just an example here, please don't post your opinion on wrestling or sports.\n \n I am just interested in how you balance your feelings about people. It could be a friend or a family member but people who you don't know would be more interesting as then you don't have a personal relationship to bias your views.\n \n Also perhaps you could mention great people in history who had a dark side.",

   "I'd have to say compartmentalize things.\n \n There are many actors, musicians and others who's personal beliefs and actions I find deplorable yet, who's works I adore.\n From William H. Macy to Kurt Cobain, I can appreciate their works yet disagree with their stances, politics and actions. I often find it odd how many seemingly normal people who become famous movie stars are 'Hollywoodized' and become band-wagon jumping XXXXXX over the span of a few years. Seems hard to avoid.\n \n As to Chris Benoit, it's hard to imagine what would set a person off to the point where they'd kill their own children (I can understand bumping the wife off though) but it happens.\n \n My son and some of his friends also liked Chris.\n But, remember, the stage presents a far different person than who actually existed and even the worst of us can do good deeds just as the best can screw up royally just one time and #### everything away.\n So, who Chris actually was may never be known.\n \n I'm sure the WWF world will reel over this with many being dumbfounded.\n \n Personally, he's gone. \n Get angry and upset, then remember the good memories and move on.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "I would admit that my respect for the person's other achievements would depend on how bad his actions were in comparison to the society he/she lived in and how extraordinary his skills and achievements were - i.e. it is a question of balance. I have in mind examples such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson who were brilliant minds and leaders but who owned slaves. Though their ownership of slaves was inconsistent with much of their rhethoric on freedom, it was a very accepted practice in its day so it is hard to judge them too harshly for it. If they lived today with the same points of view (in being open to slavery), they would be vilified. However, given the times in which they lived, I certainly judge them on balance very well.\n \n Someone like O.J. Simpson may have been a good football player in his day, but he killed his ex-wife and her boyfriend. Overall, the balance is most definitely negative and despicable. \n \n Martin Luther King apparently cheated on his wife, but his contributions toward civil rights were remarkable and I judge him well in the balance.\n \n Christopher Columbus was certainly brave and enterprising enough to sail into the unknown based on limited information about the world (he thought the world was much smaller so that he would end up in Asia). However, he also started brutal enslavement of the native people's of Central America for wealth for himself and the crown. So, I have quite mixed feelings about him.\n \n To some degree, we like our heros pure in character, but we are willing to overlook some indiscretion and immorality - to a point.",

It's somewhat amusing that someone always manages to have these thoughts after a bazaar killing.",
