   "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/22/international/middleeast/22intel.html\n \n Iraq May Be Prime Place for Training of Militants, C.I.A. Report Concludes\n By DOUGLAS JEHL \n Published: June 22, 2005\n WASHINGTON, June 21 - A new classified assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency says Iraq may prove to be an even more effective training ground for Islamic extremists than Afghanistan was in Al Qaeda's early days, because it is serving as a real-world laboratory for urban combat. \n \n The assessment, completed last month and circulated among government agencies, was described in recent days by several Congressional and intelligence officials. The officials said it made clear that the war was likely to produce a dangerous legacy by dispersing to other countries Iraqi and foreign combatants more adept and better organized than they were before the conflict. \n \n Congressional and intelligence officials who described the assessment called it a thorough examination that included extensive discussion of the areas that might be particularly prone to infiltration by combatants from Iraq, either Iraqis or foreigners. \n \n They said the assessment had argued that Iraq, since the American invasion of 2003, had in many ways assumed the role played by Afghanistan during the rise of Al Qaeda during the 1980's and 1990's, as a magnet and a proving ground for Islamic extremists from Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries.\n \n The officials said the report spelled out how the urban nature of the war in Iraq was helping combatants learn how to carry out assassinations, kidnappings, car bombings and other kinds of attacks that were never a staple of the fighting in Afghanistan during the anti-Soviet campaigns of the 1980's. It was during that conflict, primarily rural and conventional, that the United States provided arms to Osama bin Laden and other militants, who later formed Al Qaeda. \n \n The assessment said the central role played by Iraq meant that, for now, most potential terrorists were likely to focus their energies on attacking American forces there, rather than carrying out attacks elsewhere, the officials said. But the officials said Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries would soon have to contend with militants who leave Iraq equipped with considerable experience and training. \n \n Previous warnings of this kind have been less detailed, as when Porter J. Goss, the director of central intelligence, told Congress earlier in the year that jihadists who survive the continued fighting in Iraq would leave there \"experienced in and focused on acts of urban terrorism,\" and form \"a potential pool of contacts to build transnational terrorist cells, groups and networks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries.\"\n \n The officials who described the new assessment said they could not be identified by name because of the classified nature of the document. The officials came from three different government organizations, and all said they had read the document.\n \n The officials said the document did not address whether the anti-American insurgency in Iraq was indeed in the \"last throes,\" as Vice President Dick Cheney said recently. \n \n In an interview in the current issue of Time magazine, Mr. Goss is quoted as saying that he believed that the insurgents were \"not quite in the last throes, but I think they are very close to it,\" though he did not say such a view was based on a formal intelligence assessment. \n \n \"I think that every day that goes by in Iraq where they have their own government, and it's moving forward, reinforces just how radical these people are and how unwanted they are,\" Mr. Goss was quoted as saying of the insurgents. The interview was the first granted by Mr. Goss since he took over as C.I.A. chief last September.\n \n The officials who described the new intelligence report would not say specifically which regions of the world were described as particularly vulnerable to a spillover from Iraq. But they noted that the combatants in Iraq, whether Iraqis or foreign fighters, have primarily been Arabs who would fit in most easily in other Arab societies. Many of the combatants from Afghanistan came from South Asia and Central Asia, and many went on to campaigns in the 1990's in Chechnya, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and other locations.\n \n In an interview last week, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, said he had been told by American officials during a recent trip to Iraq that a \"disproportionate number\" of the foreign fighters now active there came from Saudi Arabia. A former American intelligence official who visited Saudi Arabia recently said officials there had grown increasingly worried that young Saudis who were leaving to fight Americans in Iraq, traveling by way of Damascus, the Syrian capital, would pose an increased threat to Saudi stability if and when they returned home.",

   "Then why use the word, if you don't have a clear idea of what it means? To claim that \"terrorists\" deserve mistreatment and then not know how to distinguish a terrorist from a non-terrorist seems pretty sloppy reasoning to me - it's just a buzzword designed to evoke images of 9/11 when most the people imprisoned have never been involved in any terrorist attack.\n \n \n \n Yes, but this would also cover, for example, a Kurd who rebelled against Saddam without a uniform. They aren't covered by the convention, but this doesn't imply that it's moral or practical to mistreat them.\n \n The geneva accord is what it is, it isn't a magic wand that justifies abuse of anyone who falls outside its coverage, or more accurately, anyone who is believe to fall outside its coverage.\n \n It doesn't appear to have been written with this kind of situation in mind, where non-state forces fight a guerrilla war in urban areas, so their exclusion shouldn't really be taken to mean there is some sort of international consensus that treating these fighters worse than regular troops is ok. There seems to me no moral reason for treating Saddam's Elite Troops better than some guy who picked up a rifle because he hates Americans in his country.\n\n \n \n What the hell are you talking about??? Do I have to define every word you ask me to? I posted a U.N link that deals with the problem of the definition of terrorism for you. And the U.S Congress is also trying to improve the current definition of 'terrorist'. It's a problematic term, o.k so what, are you going to start telling people they're not allowed to use it??? \n \n What an ego...\n \n Well, when you come back down to earth then maybe we can continue this discussion. As for the treatment of prisoners, like I said there is no reason to treat them worse than anyone else, but they don't have the rights that lawful combatants have. They don't fight according to any law so they exclude themselves from the normal rights granted to any POW.\n It's a complicated business, but any reasonable person can see that you can't treat terrorists the same way you treat a U.S citizen who may have been caught stealing.

Whilst combatants and non-combatants are provided substantial protection, a lesser level of protection is afforded to unlawful combatants.\n The third(GCIII) and fourth(GCIV) Geneva Conventions are the two most relevant for the treatment of the victims of conflicts. Both treaties state in their similarly worded article 3 that in a non-international armed conflict that \"Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms... shall in all circumstances be treated humanely and that there must not be any \"violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture.\" or \"outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment\".\n Under GCIV most enemy civilians in an international armed conflict will be \"Protected Persons\" under the meaning of GCIV, (see exemptions section immediatly after this for those who are not). Under article 32, protected persons have the right to protection from \"murder, torture, corporal punishments, mutilation and medical or scientific experiments...but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by non-combatant or military agents.\"\n The treatment of prisoners of war (POWs) in an international armed conflict is covered by GCIII. In particular article 17 states that \"No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\".\n GCIII POW status has far fewer exemptions than \"Protected Person\" status under GCIV. If a person is an enemy combatant in an international armed conflict, then they will have the protection of GCIII and be entitled to be regarded as POWs under GCIII unless they are an unlawful combatant. If there is a question of whether the combatant is an unlawful combatant, they must be treated as POW's \"until their status has been determined by a competent tribunal\" (GCIII article 5). If the tribunal decides that they are an unlawful combatant, and they are a Protected Person under GCIV, they will still have the some protections under GCIV Article 5. They must be \"treated with humanity and, in case of trial [for ], shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention\".\n A person, who is found guilty of war crimes in an international armed conflict, or is not protected by GCIV because of some other exemption, is no longer protected by the Geneva Conventions.\n\n the last part is the point of contention. are they illegal combatants for having violated the GC rule of war.\n \nGeneva Convention IV exemptions\n GCIV provides an important exemption:\n \n\"Where in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention [ie GCIV] as would ... be prejudicial to the security of such State.\" (GVIV article 5)\n\n In a conflict like the U.S. War on Terrorism many so-called \"unlawful combatants\" have been controversially denied protection under the Geneva Conventions, because they are either excluded by their nationality (see below) or they are deemed to be so dangerous that Article 5 can be invoked.\n There are two further groups who are not protected by GCIV:\n 1. Nationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected by it.\n 2. Nationals of a neutral State in the territory of a combatant State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, cannot claim the protection of GCIV if their home state has normal diplomatic representation in the State that holds them (article 4). Since nearly every state has diplomatic recognition of every other state, most citizens of neutral countries in a war zone are not able to claim any protection from GCIV.\n\n afaik, the taleban were never confirm their adherence to the GC\n nor have the current afghan or saudi governments asked for these detainees back.",

Their alleged crimes, he said, were \"at least partly\" planned in Spain-strengthening the case for extradition. He argued that Guantanamo Bay, being under US control, fell within the 1971 extradition treaty between the two countries.\n\n this is from a Socialist News  source too ;)\n so Spain got its citizen back. but the other three are not. they wwanted the other three because they had evidence against them in spain. i wonder if their crimes occurred in spain as well. no matter, as they are not spanish citizens, i am reluctant to think without their national government consent the three should be sent to spain.\n \n \nIf we're treating them so well, then why has the camp been condemned by both AI and the Red Cross? Why won't Bush allow any sort of public inspection? Why the repeated claims of abuse? \n\n the only independent group with actually access to Gitmo is the red cross. amnesty internation has not even been there to make its own assessment. thus they are making condemnation based on hearsays. and using poor analogy at that. they have since admitted no first hand information and that the gulag comparison was essentially a publicity stunt\n thus that leave the red cross. from their web page for the Annual Report press conference dated June 17 2005\n \nReplying to questions about the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, President Kellenberger said the ICRC continued to carry out its visits on a regular basis. He said the ICRC pursued its confidential dialogue with the US authorities and that its recommendations had been implemented in part, as in many other contexts. \n\n and a search of their site with guantanamo found no condemnation. perhaps you can link me?\n \n \nYou say that as long as there are no moral improprieties, you're fine.

I believe that if any one of them had the opportunity to visit GTMO and witness the operation first hand, they would change their tone, if not their minds altogether.\n Not only are the detainees treated humanely (top-notch medical care, hearty meals, recreational facilities, full access to religious observance, etc..) but I personally witnessed instances when detainees did not want to leave. It was not uncommon for my platoon to guard an airfield for hours in preparation for sending a detainee home, only to turn around and bring him back to the detention facility - because he refused to leave! These detainees are not stupid-they know that real torture and inhumane treatment await them at home. And while I know they're not happy to be in GTMO, they rest assured that they will be treated well because Americans play by the rules.\n \n I feel sheepish even having to defend this issue. While our servicemen (and innocent Iraqi citizens) are being blown-up and tortured overseas, the media obsesses over a handful of \"mishandled\" Korans and excessive air conditioning. (It's also worth noting that these so-called instances of \"abuse\" at GTMO were all uncovered by internal Army investigations! It's not as if the Army is torturing people and covering it up. On the contrary, the minute the Army gets wind of minor misconduct it swiftly removes and prosecutes those involved. This is an institution upholding the highest moral traditions of our country.)

There may be no law that says we need to treat the detainees better. There may be no treaty saying they must have some sort of legal representation.

If I can't convince you that Padilla's detention is wrong, legally and more importantly ethically, then I have no hope of convincing you that Gitmo is a problem. Shall we start here?\n\n \n lets start here then with this summary from the wikipedia , not quite a neutral source but close enough.\n \nJos\u00e9 Padilla (also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir) (born October 18, 1970) is accused of being a terrorist by the United States government. He is currently being detained without charge in a South Carolina military prison under orders of President George W. Bush.\n \n The U.S. administration describes him as an illegal enemy combatant however this is not a legal definition because he has not been in front of a \"competent [military] tribunal\", as stipulated under Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention, to ascertain if he is an enemy combatant who has broken the laws of war.\n Born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, Padilla became a gang member after moving to Chicago, Illinois, and was arrested several times. During his gang years, he maintained several aliases, such as Jos\u00e9 Rivera, Jos\u00e9 Alicea, Jos\u00e9 Hernandez and Jos\u00e9 Ortiz. After serving his last jail sentence, he converted to Islam. He went to the Masjid Al-Iman mosque in Fort Lauderdale, Florida with Adham Amin Hassoun, who at that time was the registered agent for Benevolence International Foundation, a charity which U.S. investigators have accused of funding terrorist activities. Padilla and Hassoun became friends. U.S. authorities accuse Hassoun of consorting with radical Islamic fundamentalists, possibly including Al-Qaida. Hassoun was arrested in 2002 for overstaying his visa. [1]\n Padilla traveled to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. On his return, he was arrested by federal agents at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on May 8, 2002 and held as material witness on the warrant issued in New York State about the 2001 9/11 attacks. On June 9, 2002 President Bush issued an order to Secretary Rumsfeld to detain Padilla as an \"enemy combatant\". The order legally justified the detention by leaning on the AUMF which authorized the President to \"...use all necessary force against ... such nations, organizations, or persons.\" and in the opinion of the administration a U.S. citizen can be an enemy combatant (This was decided by the United States Supreme Court in the case of ex parte Quirin)[2]. Padilla is currently being detained without charge in a naval brig at Hanahan in South Carolina and is accused by the Bush Administration of being an illegal enemy combatant and a nuclear terrorist planning to set off a dirty bomb. [3]\n On December 18, 2003, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals declared that the Bush Administration lacked the authority to designate a U.S. citizen arrested on U.S. soil an \"illegal enemy combatant\" without clear congressional authorization (per 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001(a)); it consequently ordered the government to release him from military custody within thirty days[4]. However, the court has stayed the order pending appeal.\n On February 20, 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the government's appeal. The Supreme Court heard the case, Rumsfeld v. Padilla, in April 2004, but on June 28 it was thrown out on a technicality. The court declared that New York State, where the case was originally filed, was an improper venue and that the case should have been filed in South Carolina, where Padilla was being held.\n On February 28, 2005, in Spartanburg, South Carolina, U.S. District Judge Henry Floyd ordered the Bush administration to either charge Padilla or release him[5]. He relied on the Supreme Court's ruling in the parallel enemy combatant case of Yaser Hamdi (Hamdi v. Rumsfeld), in which the majority decision declared a \"state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nation's citizens.\"\n\n so that is the background and the time course\n lets then look at his \"crimes\". we can use this bit from Time (which isn't a mouthpiece for the administration).\n \nPadilla, 31, had prepped hard for his meeting, but his ambition outstripped his guile. Senior U.S. officials tell Time that Padilla, conducting research on the Internet, had come across instructions for building a nuclear bomb-\"an H-bomb,\" as a top official described it. The instructions were laughably inaccurate-more a parody than a plan-but not recognizing that, Padilla took them to Abu Zubaydah and other al-Qaeda planners and said he wanted to detonate such a weapon in the U.S. \"He was trying to build something that would attain a nuclear yield,\" says a senior Bush Administration official monitoring Padilla's case. In response, Abu Zubaydah apparently cautioned his eager job applicant to think smaller-to get some training and attack America with a so-called \"dirty bomb,\" a conventional explosive packed with radioactive waste that would spew when the bomb blew up. \"They sent him to the U.S. to see what he could do-plan and execute,\" the official says. What he did was get arrested as soon as he stepped off the plane on May 8, having come full circle, back to Chicago, the site of his first encounters with the law.\n ***\n And so Padilla began a 10-year odyssey, moving ever closer to radical elements within Islam. In South Florida, as many as 60,000 Muslims attend two dozen mosques and religious sites, spanning the spectrum of ideology. A subculture of extremism has taken hold in certain pockets. \"Hamas and Hizballah have a wide network here,\" says a prominent Islamic community leader. \"We have been taking a nap on this issue for far too long. These are people who are convinced that the West is evil and America is 'Darul Harb,'\" the Place of War. The community leader, who requested anonymity, describes a growing radicalized cadre of mostly Middle Eastern men who aggressively recruit young Muslims. These men often drive BMWs and Mercedes and lure followers with money, he says.\n \n Padilla attended at least two mosques in the Broward County area that have since been linked to extremist activity. One is the Darul Uloom Islamic Institute in Pembroke Pines. Last month two men in their 20s who had frequented the Darul Uloom mosque were arrested on federal charges of plotting to blow up electrical power stations in South Florida as part of a \"holy war\" against the U.S. Maulana Shafayat, imam of the Darul Uloom mosque, says he condemns extremist ideology. But, he concedes, \"a certain percentage [of converts] do get radical. They are mostly less educated, and they are the ones who feel they are oppressed.\"\n ***\n In March Abu Zubaydah was captured in Pakistan. A month later, he hinted to his FBI and CIA interrogators that he had talked to people who wanted to put together a dirty bomb, says a U.S. official. He provided no details, but agents started comparing intelligence as well as material from safe houses they had raided. Out popped Padilla's name, the official says. They then matched the name to a passport photo of Padilla and checked the identification with Abu Zubaydah, who confirmed it. The chase was on.\n\n here is a US citizen\n who plots with enemies of the US against the US\n confirmed by one enemy involved\n \n lets start here and proceed.\n and lets leave it in this thread to minimize interlopers.",

The thing is, we already have that. Most of it's in the Constitution. It includes things like a trial by jury, legal representation, a prompt trial. I'm sure you're familiar with it all. These are the rules we have. Bush wants exceptions to these rules, and he wants to define what the excpetions are.\n You say Padilla goes to trial July 19. That's 3 years after he was arrested, and Bush has fought his going to trial the whole way.

What I'd like to know from you is this: is it good that he's finally getting his day in court?

   "lets look at the last Supreme Court decision as agreed to as the facts:\n \nRUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE v. PADILLA ET AL. \n CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT No. 03-1027. Argued April 28, 2004-Decided June 28, 2004 \n \n [i]Respondent Padilla, a United States citizen, was brought to New York for detention in federal criminal custody after federal agents apprehended him while executing a material witness warrant issued by the District Court for the Southern District of New York (Southern District) in connection with its grand jury investigation into the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks. While his motion to vacate the warrant was pending, the President issued an order to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld designating Padilla an \"enemy combatant\" and directing that he be detained in military custody. Padilla was later moved to a Navy brig in Charleston, S. C., where he has been held ever since. His counsel then filed in the Southern District a habeas petition under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72241, which, as amended, alleged that Padilla's military detention violates the Constitution, and named as respondents the President, the Secretary, and Melanie Marr, the brig's commander. The Government moved to dismiss, arguing, inter alia, that Commander Marr, as Padilla's immediate custodian, was the only proper respondent, and that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over her because she is located outside the Southern District. That court held that the Secretary's personal involvement in Padilla's military custody rendered him a proper respondent, and that it could assert jurisdiction over the Secretary under New York's long-arm statute, notwithstanding his absence from the District. On the merits, the court accepted the Government's contention that the President has authority as Commander in Chief to detain as enemy combatants citizens captured on American soil during a time of war. The Second Circuit agreed that the Secretary was a proper respondent and that the Southern District had jurisdiction over the Secretary under New York's long-arm statute. The appeals court reversed on the merits, however, holding that the President lacks authority to detain Padilla militarily.

   "\n essentially the government is arguing that Padilla is a prisoner of war, even as a citizen of the US, and thus could be held as such. and as such, cannot be charged by the Geneva Convention, which has the stature of law.\n naturally there is disagreement.\n \n\n The administration is arguing. Since we're dealing with mulitple branches of the government we should try to be precise to avoid confusion. The administration argued one way, the higher courts have ruled otherwise.\n \n You still haven't said what you think of all this. You seem to be defending the administration, so I must assume you approve, but I'd like it if you would spell it out. Do you approve of the manner of Padilla's detention? Is it a good or bad thing that he's getting a trial?\n \n \n \n\n regarding the bill of right, it has little to do with mistrusting the government, rather the affirmation of inalienable rights and that the citizens are the foundation for government.\n\n You're right, I overstated my case. Most of the Bill of Rights is an affirmation of rights. However, the 4th, 5th, and 6th limit the powers of gevernment to protect the people. Protect them from the government.\n \n I guess I did this backwards. Before defending my point perhaps I should have simply presented it clearly, and seen if you even disagreed. So here it is: A certain distrust of the government is inherent in our form of government. We have three branches so that they can keep tabs on each other, and we the citizens must keep tabs on them. The government must be able to justify its actions to the people, and the actions of the government must be visible to the people. Any time the government hides its actions we the people should be suspicious.\n \n So what do you think? If the government is acting suspiciously should our first reaction be to trust them or doubt them?",

   "1. that there is a disagreement within the government about padilla is proof that the system of check and balance remains intact and functional. a far cry from the totalitarian claims some have made.\n 2. my thoughts on the case? i do understand the concerns the administration has in this matter. i do believe in times of war we stretch the limits of constitutional powers as the balance of goal shifts for security over liberty. is padilla a traitor or an enemy combatant? i think it comes down to level of threat he posed, if it is just passing along information that is harmful to our interests, then he is simply a traitor. if he plans to attack and harm american civilians and infrastructure, then he is a combatant. as a traitor, he should be charged and tried. as a combatant he should be detained. i have no strong views either way actually, and what would swing me one way or the other is whether state secret may be involved. i do not believe the government has acted suspiciously with padilla or gitmo. \n 3. i do not inject nefarious scheme into the governments as some have. the government is made up of elected persons. their views may be different from mine, but as long as they act to preserve the nation within the bounds of the constitution i am fine with it. some ideals are better than others and thus worthy of support from me, others are less and should be criticized or even ridiculed. but to project conspiracy or distrust into the function of government i believe counter productive. the bill of rights is a reminder that we are the government, that the government serves us, without us there can be no government. this firstly and formost. secondarily to delineate powers and facilitate function, the three branches are constructed. it is a division of responsibility as well as check and balance.\n 4. i do believe the government has acted wrongly with the Kelo case. this should be raising alarms all over the country as it affects all of us and we have limited legal recourse right now due to the fact that it was a supreme court decision.",

It is, in most cases, impossible. Sure, there are often crank allegations made which a little research can dismiss. That isn't the general case, however. Taking Gitmo as an example, there is no way for us to support any of the allegations that anyone has made. I can't demonstrate mis-treatment, you can't demonstrate lack of mis-treatment. When it comes to the government it's often impossible for the average citizen to confirm anything, unless the government wants something confirmed.\n \n So where does that leave us? We either risk complicitcy or hysteria. In my experience good people doing nothing has allowed more harm than good people trying too hard. People standing up and demanding proof that no wrong doing is happening is seldom more than an inconvienence; and their demands should be easy to meet, if there is in fact no wrong doing. People not saying anything until too late can be blamed, at least in part, for many of the wrongs of modern history. A partial list would include McCarthism, the Japanese interment camps, and Hitler. I'm sure you can add to this list with little effort.\n \n You seem to invision a perfect world where all decision are informed decisions. That would be fantastic, but its not the world we live in. We must all act, or choose not to act, on incomplete data. Given that, it is my instinct to distrust those who could provide relevant data, but don't. Again using Gitmo as an example, Bush could prove that there's no mistreatment, without jepordising security. That fact that he won't makes me suspicious. It's impossible for me to prove any of my suspicions, so all I can do is point fingers and make a fuss. Given a choice between complicitsy in an immoral act and unfounded hysteria, I will always choose to be a nuicance rather than risk a wrong being done. If there is no wrong doing then there is little if any damage caused by demanding proof of this. If something immoral has occurred, if the line you talk about has been crossed, then the sooner it's brought to light the better. And the more people who demand proof, one way or the other, the quicker truth will be served.\n \n Edit:\n Just wanted to add what a pleasure it is to debate with a non-jingoistic conservative. People who can hold a lengthy debate with someone they disagree with on this board without resorting to insults or rhetoric are rare. Thanks for the good discussion.",

Ellen Tauscher said Monday that she observed improved conditions for suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba but fears the improvements have come because the United States is turning over new suspects to be interrogated by countries with records of torture***\n When the wild accusations being thrown around by left wing wack jobs turn out to be false, they \"fear\" that the evil US is now outsourcing torture and \"sending suspects to other countries.\" emoticon_rolleyes\n \n These fools have been proven wrong time after time after time, and have ne shame in continuing to try and propagate their degenerate ideas about the world. They are ceaseless in their attempts to smear America.\n \n before we invaded Afghanistan we were feverishly warned and derated about how the mountains were too high, the winters too cold, the people too ruggedly tenacious and tougher than two dollar steaks, we were endlessly hounded about massive famine by the likes of Soros, and how we could never win in that Afghanistan proved the cemetary for the Russians and British and how the US would be ground up in a similar manner. \n \n Then when the Taliban ceased to be a governing body and was reduced to the likes of cockroaches scurrying about the countryside the same fools who offered the litany of dire predcitions and warnings moved on with no shame to casting the same stupid warnings about Iraq. And when the Iraqi military was routed in three weeks the crowd of bantering dooms day defeatists snarled that it was an ovbious outcome agaisnt a fifth rate military. \n \n And so it is that the flaming lib Rep. Tauscher finds nothing to bolster the ludicrous claims that Americans are no different than Nazis which has been coming from the frothing fringe of the wacko Left as well as the most prominent figures of the Democratic Party, and so rather than reassessing herself Tauscher continues on with her smear America first tack that is so typical of the Left. Sniffing out any way possible to embarrass, smear and besmirch America's image, and aid our enemies who are trying to murder as many Americans as possible.\n \n The Left has but one course of action and that is too smear, besmirch, defame, and destroy the image of their opponents because they cannot compete within the realm of honest intellectual debate and persuade people of the goodness of their ideas. Because their ideas and cultural values are antithetical to the United States of America as we know it. \n \n This is seen in the wholesale employment of the Hitlerian slur tactic that has become common place among Leftists, the talking point du jour, from Dick Durbin to Robert Bird to George Soros to Julian Bond to Al Gore, and is sympathisized and supported by the Democratic leadership as reflected in the deafening silence on the part of Democratic leaders to repudiate the grossly ignorant and demagogic tactics of their Democratic comrades.",

Looking at it that way the only logical approach is to harbor a certain level of suspicion.\n\n 1. i dismiss the AI report because it is a second hand report. i am skeptical of any second hand reports. by using inappropriate descriptives, the AI has only hurt their credibility. the red cross report i cannot find on the red cross site. thus it becomes a second hand report of the red cross report which reports on Gitmo. too far removed. as to the soldiers remark, i am willing to dismiss them in total, which then to remain objective i would dismiss the detainees remarks as well. leaving us at a null point.\n \n 2. correct that we have insufficient data and are unlikely to arrive at definitive conclusion. your assumption is that in the absence of proof of innocence, the government is acting maliciously. my assumption is that in the absence of proof of innocence and the absence of proof of guilt, is an absence of proof of any thing. to me to act at this point, to act out of absence of proof, is tantamound to acting out of ignorance, which means to act based on bias. which i try to minimize. \n \n 3. in the absence of proof, supposition can be made of consequences apart from motives. but wouldn't it be better to obtain more information rather than to pass judgement? let another branch of government investigate. but then didn't the court look at this and didn't perceive immediate wrongs? didn't congress just returned 16 members from an inspection tour? this is my major criticism of those who rail. instead of seeking more information many would prefer to fabricate meaningless comparisons. since the various branches of government do have access to gitmo, this information can be obtained. and has been obtained.\n \n 4. if we continually supposes the government to be doing wrong, it undermine the ability of our government to function when they are doing right, and we as a nation becomes even more divided. we all lose even when the government is right. and in a war we needs resolve and unity to ever hope for victory. \n \n 5. i would much prefer we act out of factual information rather than unsubstantiated fear. and in the absence of factual information i would rather we act out of unsubstantiated reasoning rather than unsubstantiable fears. (as was the case with invading iraq). \n \n 6. if we are detaining them unjustly without torture, they have lost a few years. if we are detaining them justly we are saving innocent lives without taking theirs (the detainees). net unsubstantiated reasoning favors continued detention with continued observation. unsubstantiable fears include illegality (see #8) and torture.\n \n \nI don't believe I ever said that the detainees are innocent until proven guilty. At best I pointed out that some of them may be innocent, and we'll never know. Likewise, I don't assume the administration is guilty. I'm merely suspicious. The rational for my suspicion is quite simple. Bush is running a secret jail. That's it, that's enough. Any time any government runs a secret jail, people should be concerned.\n\n 7. no, your point is that the bush administration is guilty until proven innocent. and in the absence of such proof he continues to be guilty.\n \n 8. Gitmo is not a secret jail by along shot.\n we all know about it, had people come and inspected, its in the press.\n so no, he is not running a secret jail, just one that alot people don't like. so why don't they like it?\n a. detaining people not as PoW but as illegal combatants, thus depriving them of GC protection. but this does not mean it is illegal. this does not mean they are being tortured.\n b. absence of charges. charging PoW is against the GC. and their status as illegal combatants have been vetted by the military, all that is required by the GC.\n c. indeterminate length of detention. but had they been accorded PoW status their detention would be indeterminate as well.\n d. inaccessible. all nationals whose government have requested them have been returned. and see #3 above\n \n 9. thus to me the unease is really because what is done seems to be a loophole of the GC. but this assumes that it is a loophole. the GC specified who should be protected, those who deserve to be protected. As should be as this was one of the stated goals. the GC is less precise about those who are not protected, that is because it was never the thrust of the GC to specify those who should not be protected (which would be perverse).",

   "http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/062705L.shtml\n \n Senator Durbin Defends America's Values\n By James J. Zogby\n t r u t h o u t | Perspective\n \n Monday 27 June 2005\n \n In recent weeks, controversy has mounted over the treatment meted out to detainees at US facilities in Guant\u00e1namo Bay and other locations around the world. In an effort to deal with the criticism and change the subject, the White House and their allies have responded, blasting critics like Amnesty International, charging that their comments damage the image of the US, endanger American troops and harm the war on terrorism. \n \n Watching the right wing's attack machine go into motion is really quite a spectacle. It targets its victim, strikes, and then launches into a multimedia, multi-day assault. Every medium is used: the White House comments, Senators and Congressmen issue releases. And then Fox News, radio talk shows, the Washington Times, web logs and web sites - all carry the \"story\" and add to it. The initial attack is then echoed and magnified. The goal is to bury the target and silence critics with overwhelming force. Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) is their most recent target. Last week on the Senate floor, Durbin, who in the past has successfully led the effort to pass anti-torture legislation, read aloud a statement by an FBI agent describing the torture of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. He said that the techniques described by the agent called to mind those used by repressive regimes, including the Nazis and Soviets. \n \n The response was quick and harsh, utilizing all the media noted above. Prominent among the attackers were former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. Gingrich said that Durbin's comments appeared on Al-Jazeera, and that, \"You cannot have a public official quoted throughout the world by our enemies describing the US in these terms - it puts every young American in uniform at risk.\"\n \n Frist went further, mischaracterizing Durbin's remarks, alleging that his statement was \"anti-American and only fuels the animus of our enemies ... It is this type of language that they use to recruit others to be car bombers, suicide attackers, hostage takers, and full-fledged jihadists.\" The assault went on for a week, frightening many from coming to Durbin's defense. \n \n Abandoned by his allies, Durbin went to the Senate floor and apologized for the inept historical references. But on the critical issues of torture and detention, he firmly stood his ground.\n \n The rhetorical excesses of Gingrich and Frist are dead wrong. What damages the US image and endangers us are not comments by Durbin and other critics of Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It is the Bush administration's detention and interrogation policies. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld explicitly authorized the use of abusive interrogation techniques at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. FBI agents and the Red Cross both concluded that the use of these techniques at Guant\u00e1namo constituted \"torture.\" In the past, the United States has always condemned the use of such techniques. Now, we apparently approve of them.\n \n According to polls we have conducted, Arab attitudes toward the United States have dropped to dangerously low levels. The treatment of Arab and Muslim prisoners is a big reason, rivaling regional disapproval of US policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the war in Iraq.\n \n Buttressing these poll results are my experiences in the Arab world, where I travel frequently. In conversations with opinion leaders and average citizens across the region, they frequently note their deep disappointment with current state of our human rights policy. Many Arab reformers tell me that our behavior now mimics that of their own governments. \n \n President Bush has linked the spread of democracy to the war on terrorism. Unfortunately, the indefinite secret detention and highly coercive interrogation of Arab and Muslim detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay and other locations has harmed our ability to advocate credibly for democratic reforms. Indeed, some governments now point to American practices to justify their own human rights abuses. \n \n President Bush has suggested that anti-democratic practices and human rights abuses promote instability and create the conditions that can breed terrorism. Democratic reformers and human rights activists used to look to the US as an exemplar, as the city on a hill. Now they are dismissed by their countrymen when they point to the American experience.\n \n Once we set a high standard for the world; now we have lowered the bar. The damage to our image, to the values we have sought to project, and to our ability to deal more effectively with root causes of terror have been profound. Efforts to silence debate and the attacks against courageous opponents of torture like Dick Durbin are wrong and send the wrong message to our world. Comments by Durbin and other critics of torture help, not hurt, the US image in the Middle East. People there are already outraged about Guant\u00e1namo and Abu Ghraib. The fact that Durbin and others have demonstrated the courage to speak out and challenge these shameful and abusive practices demonstrates to the Arab world that not all Americans support what the world knows we have done. As their criticism makes clear, there are still Americans who hold high the values we call on others to emulate. At a time when we're trying to spread democracy, Durbin and other critics show people in the Arab world how a democracy works. The good new is that not only has Durbin not been silenced, but the controversy about Guant\u00e1namo and Abu Ghraib and the treatment of detainees, in general, is growing and will not be stopped until changes are made.",

He and the six others were held in Russia for three months, then released a year ago.\n \n Vakhitov said at a news conference organized by the state RIA-Novosti news agency that guards in Cuba threw the Quran in the toilet. However, he later told The Associated Press he did not witness the actions.\n\n the Guardian \n as compared to before\n \nRFE/RL's North Caucasus Service recently spoke with the family members of two of the detainees. One is Amina Hasanova, the mother of Airat Vakhitov. Vakhitov was born in Tatarstan, and as an adult became the imam at a mosque in the republic. Hasanova said her son went to Chechnya in 1999 to study Islam, but was quickly detained by Chechen fighters, who suspected him of being a Russian spy. He was released after several months and returned to Tatarstan.\n \n At that point, Hasanova said, he began to experience harassment by the Russian security services, and fled to Afghanistan. Hasanova said she learned of his fate after receiving a letter from him last November. She said her son is feeling well and is satisfied with the conditions of his detention at Guantanamo.\n \n \"He writes that he is treated kindly and with respect, that he has good food, cleanliness, and as he says in his letter, he feels better than if he was at the best Russian sanatoriums,\" Hasanova said.\n \n Vakhitov's mother said he also writes that his fellow detainees are friendly toward him, and that they often lend each other copies of the Koran and pray together. Hasanova is aware of the Russian efforts to extradite the detainees for trial at home, and said the thought fills her with dread.\n \n \"I am terribly afraid that he may be returned to Russia and put into a Russian prison. It would be very terrible. It is terrible for me and for all Muslims. It is terrible,\" she said. \"I am afraid of everything in the Russian jails. It is better for me that he remains there than to be jailed in Russia.\"\n \n Nina Adizheva is the mother of Rasul Kudaev of Kabardino-Balkaria. She said her son left Russia for Afghanistan after being persecuted for his Muslim activities at home. But she said Rasul could not have fought in Afghanistan because of his weak health.

They were provided to me by one of the JAG lawyers working at CITF. One of these is a review of interrogation methods by a DOD lawyer. Basically, it appears that the lawyer worked hard to write a legal justification for the type of interviews they (the Army) want to conduct here.\"\n \n 4. \"After we got off the phone, I found the attached E-mail which we sent to General Miller last year. Also, there is a copy of the military's use of approved coercive techniques which are quite different I am sure from the Bureau guidelines you are preparing.\"\n \n 5. \"FBI operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and GTMO have each been queried and all have reported back that they do not have any direct knowledge of any abusive interrogation techniques being used. Each location was aware of rumors of abuse which has surfaced as a direct result of pending Military investigations into abusive interrogation techniques.\"\n \n 6. \"On 07/27/2004, SAs from WFO met with members of U.S. Army Criminal Investigative Division regarding the alleged rape of juvenile male detainee at Abu Ghraib prison.\"{who rape him, another inmate?}\n \n 7. \"Be advised, we have already experienced what I would describe as an unfavorable contact with the EDVA regarding WFO's failure to more aggressively address pending allegations. Specifically, AUSA Rod Spencer, USAO-EDVA, has already berated an agent and I literally have a message on my desk to call him regarding these cases. . . .[T]here will soon come a time when WFO will no longer be able to hold the EDVA off on these matters before DOJ starts calling you. It would be of great benefit if HQ could run a little interference with DOJ.

He does not feel the Americans are giving him proper treatment for his injuries.\"{unable to determine cause of injury, or treatment rendered. but it was amusing to read that the prisoner admits to lying in interrogation.}\n \n 9. \"On several occasions, I did hear loud music being played and people yelling loudly from behind closed doors of interview rooms but I could not say that detainees were present in those rooms. I also observed strobe lights in interview rooms on several occasions but never observed these being used on detainees.\"\n \n 10. \"BAU personnel witnessed sleep deprivation, REDACTED and utilization of loud music/bright lights/growling dogs in the Detainee interview process by DOD representatives.\"\n \n 11. \"DIA has never advised the FBI that they were impersonating an FBI agent as part of their interrogation plan with REDACTED.\"\n \n 12. \"We had a meeting with TJ Harrington today and he inquired about the outcome of your meeting with DOD (General Miller) regarding REDACTED interrogations in June 2003 where an FBI agent was impersonated. Was that ever resolved? Is there any paper on your meeting we can provide to TJ?\"\n \n 13. \"Regarding the 'impersonation,' I'm still not sure what our issue is here. It's fairly clear to me that the \"FBI Agent\" wasn't successful in gaining the detainees cooperation. Thereafter, (months later) REDACTED carried the day with his ruse regarding REDACTED. Once again, this technique, and all of those used in these scenarios, was approved by the Dep Sec. Def.\" [Additionally, the specifically called into question in the EC were employed months after, and in a different environment, from the \"FBI Agent\" ruse.].{interesting that the ACLU redacted the last part from the paragraph on their website. maybe because it called into question the accuracy of the allegation?}\n \n 14. Describes Defense Department interrogation witnessed by FBI personnel. \"I saw [a] detainee sitting on the floor of the interview room with an Israeli flag draped around him, loud music being played and a strobe light flashing. I left the monitoring room immediately after seeing this activity. I did not see any other persons inside the interview room with the Israeli flag draped detainee, but suspect that this was a practice used by DOD DHS . . .\"[since the only other person inside the hallway near the interview room were dressed in green military fatigues, similar to the ones worn by DOD DHS and the DOD MP Uniformed Reservists At no time did I observe any physical assault of this detainee nor any others while asigned to GTMO ].{wondered why the ACLU redacted that last part}\n \n 15. [Please note that REDACTED has not mentioned the FBI or any of the agents discussed above in his abuse allegation. CID is pursuing interview with our agents since their names appear on the documents indicating they likely had contact with REDACTED while he was detained on the BIAP before he was transferred to the Abu Ghurayb prison REDACTED is alleging abuse during this period. In a written statement REDACTED claims] \"They tortured me and cuffed me in an act called the scorpion, and pouring cold water on me They tortured me from morning until the morning of the next day, and when I fell down from the severe torture I fell on the barbed wires, and then they dragged me from my feet and I was wounded and, and they punched me on my stomach.\"{so when you undo the ACLU redaction, what you get is an iraqi naming his torture technique before he even got to Abu Ghurayb. Since prisoners flow from the iraqi to abu ghurayb to gitmo, that likely his abuser were iraqi and regardless, did not occur at gitmo. in addition, the same memo stress \"detainee abuse investigations received their highest priority\" }\n \n 16. Several days ago a detainee arrive to the Temporary Holding Facility (THF) from one of the outstations. The outstations are used to gain tactical intelligence from detainees immediately after they are captured by the military, and are usually held there for several days. The outstations are manned by their own interrogators and interpreters. Upon arrival to the THF, all detainees are screened by medical personel and biometric information are collected. The detainee thata arrived several days ago appear to have] \"marks (burns) on him that seemed suspicious When questioned about the marks, the detainee stated that he had been tortured by his capt[ors]. Immediately this information was reported to the TF 6-26 Chain of Command, and there is currently a military 15-6 investigation initiated.\"{all before Gitmo}\n \n 17. \"The following information provides initial details from an individual REDACTED who observed serious physical abuses of civilian detainees in REDACTED Iraq during the period of REDACTED. . . . REDACTED observed numerous physical abuse incidents of Iraqi civilian detainees conducted in REDACTED Iraq. He described that such abuses included strangulation, beatings, placement of lit cigarettes into the detainees ear openings, and unauthorized interrogations. [REDACTED]\n REDACTED was providing this information to the FBI based on his knowledge that REDACTED cover-up of these abuses. He stated these cover-up efforts included REDACTED . . . .\"\n \n 18. Request for guidance regarding the OGC's EC regarding detainee abuse, referring to \"interrogation techniques made lawful\" by the \"President's Executive Order.\"\n [In sofar as DOSC REDACTED and I are aware, no BOC employee during our three rotation witnessed the abuse at Abu Gharayb that is now the subject of ongoing investigations, nor any conduct anywhere in theatre that went beyond the parameters set by the applicable Executive Order.]\n \n 20. \"Here is a brief summary of what I observed at GTMO. On a couple of occasions, I entered interview rooms to find a detainee chained hand a foot in a fetal position to the floor, with no chair, food, or water. Most times they had urinated or defecated on themselves and had been left there for 18 24 hours or more. On one occasion, the air conditioning had been turned down so far and the temperature was so cold in the room, that the barefooted detainee was shaking with cold. . . . On another occasion, the A/C had been turned off, making the temperature in the unventilated room probably well over 100 degrees. The detainee was almost unconscious on the floor with a pile of hair next to him. He had apparently been literally pulling his own hair out throughout the night. . . .\"\n \n\n since i, as well as the European Court of Human Rights, do not believe sensory depravation (#9,10, 20) constitute torture, none of these accounts support the claims of torture.\n \n \n\n 1. \"Of concern, DOD interrogators impersonating Supervisory Special Agents of the FBI told a detainee that REDACTED. These same interrogation teams then REDACTED. The detainee was also told by this interrogation team REDACTED. These tactics have produced no intelligence of a threat neutralization nature to date and CITF believes that techniques have destroyed any chance of prosecuting this detainee. If this detainee is ever released or his story made public in any way, DOD interrogators will not be held accountable because these torture techniques were done the \"FBI\" interrogators. The FBI will be left holding the bag before the public.\"\n \n 19. REDACTED stated that he had been beaten unconscious approximately three or four weeks ago when he was still at Camp X-Ray. According to REDACTED, an unknown number of guards entered his cell, unprovoked, and started spitting and curing at him. . . . REDACTED rolled onto his stomach to protect himself, REDACTED state a soldier named REDACTED jumped on his back and started beating him in the face REDACTED then choked him until he passed out. REDACTED stated that REDACTED was beating him because REDACTED was a Muslim . . . .\"\n \n 21. \"I am responding to your request for feedback on aggressive treatment and improper interview techniques used on detainees at GTMO. I did observe treatment that was not only aggressive, but personally very upsetting, although I can't say that this treatment was perpetrated by Bureau employees. It seemed that these techniques were being employed by the military, government contract employees and REDACTED.\"\n \n\n of 21 documents the ACLU felt best strengthened their case, only these 3 deserve a response to.\n #1. is a criticism of technique in sofar as its failure to produce desired information rather than the techniques being tortures.\n #19. is a translated report from a detainee. credible?\n #21. aggressive treatment and improper interview techniques do not equate torture.\n \n \n seriously daewoo, are you really so gullible as to take the words of the reporters (ACLU or MSM) at their word instead of reading the original pdf documents even when they are available? or maybe its just intellectual laziness. yet you did post the link so i am less likely to believe it is laziness rather than inability and lack of capacity for critical analysis. amazing really how you can swallow so much whole without any pearls coming out of your mouth.\n \n Kronus has made a far more convincing case for openess and accountability than you have daewoo. maybe it is a matter of maturity of debate techniques, a better grasp of the fundamentals, and the ability to independently analyze, all which you seem to lack. but you are, like a school yard bully, are good(?) at calling names. i guess if we were in grade school you would win. unfortunately daewoo, all bullies are inherently insecure in their capacity and position, whether it be on the playground or the debate forum. calling names only reveal you to be the little boy wimpering inside on his knees.",

The definition of \"torture\" is covered under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Here is the pertinent section:\n \n \nFor the purposes of this Convention, the term \"torture\" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.\n\n \n The European Court of Human Rights exists soley to enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, which was enacted in 1953 and has absolutly no bearing on any state outside of those who signed it, including the US. the European convention on human rights contains no definition of torture, instead reading \"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\".\n \n You have still failed to address the fact that in those memos there are several accounts, directly form FBI agents about psychological torture, or did you miss them becuase you failed to actually look at them, instead reading just the little blurb? \n \n Unless you want to question the honesty of those FBI agents, the memos make quite clear that torture IS being used at GITMO, and the FBI is apparently concerned that they will be implicated in its use. There is a lot of fluff (memos that do not really matter), but that is to be expected since what the ACLU is essentially doing is fishing for information since bushs policy is to release none. \n \n So, to sum it up,\n \n 1. Your definition of torture is incorrect and has absolutly nothing to do with this istuation.\n 2. The definition of torture that DOES apply to this situation clearly includes psychological torture\n 3. The ACLU has not edited or redacted anything, the FBI did that, which you would have caught on to if you had either read the articles I posted or looked at the memos (the PDF files are direct scans of them).\n \n \n \n And fracas, nobody spoon feeds me anything. You are the one who relies soley on media figures to do your thinking for you, not I. I will seek as many sources as possible, prefereably primary documents, and THEN form an opinion.",

They descibe in some detail psychological torture techniques, then go on to say that physical torture is apparently not being employed.\n \n The last tow are particularly telling:\n \n http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/FBI.121504.5053.pdf\n http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/FBI.121504.5054.pdf\n \n \n Unfortunatly, your definiition of torture means nothing. There are 2 definitions of torture that matter. One has laready been shown. the other is the US definition of torture, which is defined under title 18, ch 113c, section 2340. It reads:\n \n \nAs used in this chapter -\n (1) ''torture'' means an act committed by a person acting under\n the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical\n or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering\n incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his\n custody or physical control;\n (2) ''severe mental pain or suffering'' means the prolonged\n mental harm caused by or resulting from -\n (A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of\n severe physical pain or suffering;\n (B) the administration or application, or threatened\n administration or application, of mind-altering substances or\n other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or\n the personality;\n (C) the threat of imminent death; or\n (D) the threat that another person will imminently be\n subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the\n administration or application of mind-altering substances or\n other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or\n personality; and\n (3) ''United States'' includes all areas under the jurisdiction\n of the United States including any of the places described in\n sections 5 and 7 of this title and section 46501(2) of title 49.\n\n \n You will note that pshychological tortuyre is definatly covered.\n \n Additionally, you will note that it includes \"all areas under the jurisdiction\n of the United States\". This specifically includes foreign military bases (this was a major issue several years ago in S America, and art fo the reason that the SOA was reorganised and reclassified). \n \n Penalties for torture:\n \n \n (a) Offense. - Whoever outside the United States commits or\n attempts to commit torture shall be fined under this title or\n imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both, and if death results to\n any person from conduct prohibited by this subsection, shall be\n punished by death or imprisoned for any term of years or for life.\n (b) Jurisdiction. - There is jurisdiction over the activity\n prohibited in subsection (a) if -\n (1) the alleged offender is a national of the United States; or\n (2) the alleged offender is present in the United States,\n irrespective of the nationality of the victim or alleged\n offender.\n (c) Conspiracy. - A person who conspires to commit an offense\n under this section shall be subject to the same penalties (other\n than the penalty of death) as the penalties prescribed for the\n offense, the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.\n\n \n \n So, lets review once again:\n \n 1. your definition of torture does not mean spit. 2 definitons apply here, and they have both been presented now.\n 2. Unless you wish to argue that the FBI agents are lying (more on this in a minute), there is sabsolutly NO QUESTION that torture is being carried out at GITMO.\n \n any questions?\n \n As far as the FBI agents lying, I find it doubtful. Theya re clearly developing deniability here, no more, no less. Situation was observed, the agent left the room and immediatly reported it to their superiors. You do things liek this so later when youa re sitting in front of a congressional hearing you can say \"The FBI had nothing to do with it and tried to stop it thorugh normal channels\".\n \n Sorry, fracas, but your argument is pretty much worthless in all regards. \n \n Why should there be an investigation? becuase according to mroe than one eye witness, FBI agents no less, there is torture being carried out at GITMO which is not only prohibited by international law, but by the laws of the united states as well. Both laws were specifically wirtten to include psychological torture becuase franklly, people who are smarter than you wrote them and relaise that psychological torture is not a good thing.",

Regression is basically a loss of autonomy, a reversion to an earlier behavioral level. As the subject regresses, his learned personality traits fall away in reverse chronological order. He begins to lose the capacity to carry out the highest creative activities, to deal with complex situations, or to cope with stressful interpersonal relationships or repeated frustrations.\"\n Inevitably, in the aftermath of torture, its victims feel helpless and powerless. This loss of control over one's life and body is manifested physically in impotence, attention deficits, and insomnia. This is often exacerbated by the disbelief many torture victims encounter, especially if they are unable to produce scars, or other \"objective\" proof of their ordeal.

It might have worked on grade school play grounds, but does not play well here.\n \n \n \nstalin hitler gulags pol pot, whatever.\n together it could be quite unpleasant the sensory depravation and humiliation. but does it constitute torture. note that the ECHR specified that even in combination it doesn't. provide a better legal reading if you don't like the ECHR's.\n\n \n Again, the ECHR has no bearing in this conversation at all. In the 60'2, russian courts ruled that cutting off people fingers did not constitute torture.\n \n \n \nsince there has not been a legal ruling on the matter in the US\n since the Convention against torture was the basis of its ruling\n since the US is a signatory to that convention, which make it US law\n i say iti will have to do as the best legal interpretation at this time.\n\n \n It would be in Europe. Unfortunatly for you, this is not Europe. Again, not once is the convention against torture mentioned in the entire ruling. Additionally, rules of evidence are different in US courts. Sorry, citing a completley irrelevant court case on a different continent, especially where the court is ruling on entirely seperate laws, dos nothign for your argument.\n \n \n never made claims otherwise. thus arguments fabricated.\n \n \n \nyou should then address the validity of the ECHR ruling, instead of saying it is mine. but we have already talked about the validity of the ECHR ruling.\n so it comes to my agreement with the ECHR, and your disagreement with the ECHR, which you, in your intepretation, rule is worthless.\n sorry, but there is no credible basis for you to claim your interpretation superior to, or that the ECHR's ruling is worthless.\n might as well proclaim yourself king of cheese.\n\n \n Maybe you could find a legal justification for using the ruling of a foreign court, which was based on entirely seperate laws, for making such deteminations. I looked and could find none. The ECHR ruling is worthless in this situation. We are not bound by the rulings of the ECHR, nor are we signatories of the EHRC. As far as I have been able to find, ther eis absolutly no possible situation where the ECHR ruling would have any effect on the issue at hand any more than the russian decision that cutting off fingers is not torture would. \n \n \nyou constructed arguments and presented them as argument, as if i somehow oppose them. and this is not fabrication? revisionism is grand, eh?\n you may think it is a slam dunk. but i've already shown you that it isn't the case. the FBI per the pdf admits to never witnessing any instances of torture. the FBI did admit to witnessing sensory depravation. since there is legal precendence to suggest that this does not constitute torture, i am curious as to why you persist on declaring these pdfs as evidence of torture. wishful thinking do not make them so. biased belief do not make them so. \n my ridiculous view is predicated on a legal ruling, yours is just your opinion.\n\n \n No, they did not. \n \n \n\"I saw [a] detainee sitting on the floor of the interview room with an Israeli flag draped around him, loud music being played and a strobe light flashing. I left the monitoring room immediately after seeing this activity.\"\n\n \n This is a clear description of the use of sensory overload, a method employed in psychological torture. \n \n Unfortunatly for you, these PDFs are damning to your argument. At least one clearly states that torture was immeditly witnessed. Many (most) of the otehrs are highly indicitive of torture. Your argument is essentially that since a court in europe, ruling on entirely different laws than those of the united states, ruled that this was not torture, once in 1978 (unlike US courts, precedent set by the ECHR are in no way binding....not even to the ECHR or to EHRC signatories), that these actions, clearly psychological torture, are not torture.\n \n \n As an interesting side note, I think that the ACLUs next move needs to eb to go after documentation form WHISC/SOA. One fo the prisoners reported to the FBI agent that he was put in a position called \"the scorpion\". Interestingly enough, there is such a position explained in some lenghth in a manual on torture that is used at WHISC whcih is generally refered to as the \"blue book\" (becuase fo the color of its cover...following the SOA mess, when SOA was renamed WHISC, manuals were given colored covers and their names removed in order to make them more difficult to sopoena under FOI lawsuits). \n \n there is no way he could have properly named the torture technique unless he heard it from someboudy who had learned it out of the blue book. I have never seen the term anywhere else, despite the fact I have studied such things extensively.",

Psychological torture is clearly covered under the convention against torture, which we are party too. It is also clearly prohibited under US domestic law, which I posted ehre for everybody to see. Your argument that it is permissibale becuase a foreign court, ruling under a different law, with a different definition of torture, found similar methods to be acceptable is frankly stupid. Once again, you have had your XXX handed to you.\n \n You want to head over and comment on the new thread about the Dawa party and their new strategic military alliance with Iran?
