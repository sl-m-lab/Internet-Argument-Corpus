   "Irish man gay-bashed in Queens, New York | Irish News | IrishCentral\n \n By\n CAHIR O'DOHERTY\n ,\n Irish Voice Reporter\n \n Tarlach MacNiallais, 47, an Irish gay man living in Jackson Heights, Queens, says he was severely assaulted by employees of a nightclub on Saturday.\n \n Police are investigating it as a hate crime, and city authorities, including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn - herself a gay woman, have become involved.\n \n MacNiallais, originally from Belfast, was punched, kicked and had a chair smashed over his head in the brutal attack by two employees of the Guadalajara De Noche restaurant in Jackson Heights at 12:43 a.m. on Saturday.\n \n In an exclusive interview with IrishCentral today, MacNiallais said: \"I want to stress that this is not a gay community versus the Mexican community story. My partner and my extended family are all Mexican. This story is about two thugs who attacked me because they didn't like the fact that we were gay.\"\n \n The story began on Saturday evening when MacNiallais, his partner of seven years, Juan, and four of Juan's brothers visited the Guadalajara De Noche restaurant in Jackson Heights. The group had expected an open mike sing-along, but they discovered that a club night had been scheduled instead.\n \n \"I've been in that bar a handful of times in the past,\" said MacNiallais.\n \n \"Sometimes they have open night, where people can get up and sing Mexican songs. But when we got there it was a dance night. So we took a table at the back of the place just beside the dance floor and we ordered a round of drinks.\"\n \n When a song that MacNiallais liked came on, he suggested to his partner that they dance. They got up, and MacNiallais led his partner to the floor. This simple act signaled to onlookers that they were probably gay.\n \n \"We're weren't doing a lambada or dancing close or anything provocative like that. We were dancing the way you do at any night - not touching, just moving to the music, you know?\"\n \n But before they had even got started, a man, described as an employee of the nightclub, came over to the couple and said: \"You can't do that in here. This is not a gay bar.\"\n \n \"To be quite honest I thought he was joking. I didn't even look at him,\" continued MacNiallais.\n \n \"I turned around and said, 'We have as much right to dance as anyone else.'\"\n \n Immediately, MacNiallais was yanked from behind. He was thrown against a wall and then punched repeatedly on the face and chest.\n \n \"They knocked me to the ground. They started kicking me. They were shouting 'this is not a gay bar' over and over. I didn't fight back because I'm not a violent person. But I did think I wasn't going to let them throw me out. I did have a right to be there. If they had asked me to leave I would have, but they didn't do that. Instead they beat me and physically dragged me to the ground.\"\n \n MacNiallais, who is six-foot-one and weighs two hundred and forty five pounds, did not fight back, but he did hold onto a chair leg to resist forcible expulsion from the club. His partner and his partner's brothers did not get involved in the fracas at any point.\n \n \"I'm glad they didn't start fighting, because then it could have been portrayed as a drunken melee. Instead they called 911,\" added MacNiallais.\n \n \"One of my partner's brothers recorded what happened on his cell phone, and on the audio you can hear me saying 'I have a right to dance with my partner, this isn't fair and then no, no, no.'\"\n \n According to MacNiallais, the two employees were laughing as they assaulted him. One of them stomped on MacNiallais' head with his foot, then picked up a chair and hit him, again on the head. Two of MacNiallais' partner's brothers stood up and persuaded other customers not to join in the assault.\n \n Daniel Dromm, the incoming City Councilman for Jackson Heights told IrishCentral: \"It's another hate crime and it's unfortunate. It seems that any time an anti-gay event occurs, like the vote against marriage equality in Albany last week, people seem to get the message that it's OK to beat up on gay people. It sends a message that our rights aren't protected and you don't have to respect people in the gay community.\n \n \"That being said, Jackson Heights is a pretty tolerant community. I know that Tarlach was with his Mexican partner and his family members and this isn't a gay community versus the Mexican community. We want to preserve that ability to co-exist and make people understand that this is not one group against the other. This is just two thugs who decided to do this.\n \n \"We are going to have a response to bring some awareness to this issue because oftentimes when things like this happen the perpetrators who do this try to send a message to the community. That's why it's important that the community send back a message that this will not be tolerated.\"\n \n MacNiallais is leery of the sensational press coverage of the story to date and particularly objects to his description as a gay activist.\n \n \"I did not just jump up and dance with a total stranger, or with the first man who walked into the bar. I want to stress that. I was dancing with my partner of seven years. He and his family have been part of my life for years.\"\n \n The police did not arrest MacNiallais for disorderly conduct, nor has there been any suggestion that his behavior was calculated to cause offense. Instead, the investigation is focusing on the assault as a hate crime. MacNiallais sustained severe bruises to his head, his arms, his underarms, his chest and thighs.\n \n \"I have just been in bits since this happened. I'm trying to deal with this and get my head around (it). I am godfather to the two sons of my partner's oldest brother. We're compadresmos. It's the closest relationship you can have next to your own brother. We're family; I've been to Mexico twice this year to stay with his parents, brothers and sisters.\"",

Yes, many have gotten their sex education that way, especially in the past, with bad outcomes. \n \n \nYou never suggested that there should be different classes for different age groups 14 to 16 and 16 to 18 maybe?\n A 14 year old is a different entity to an 18 year old..they think differently and the four years extra that the 18 year old has lived makes them far more sensible.\n You never accepted that one should suggest that the first thing 14 year olds should be told is NOT to try fisting( which is what I stated).\n You actually slated me for suggesting it .\n \n I think that the answers that I suggested to the two questions in an earlier thread were apt and responsible whereas you thought there was something wrong with me for posting them.\n \n If someone advocates teaching young children and thats what 14 year olds are..they dont think they are but responsible adults ( and parents) who have had any experience with 14 year olds know they are vulnerable and have a quite...interesting.. view of the world and their place in it.\n \n You may or may not have noticed but I stressed 14 year olds not 18 year olds but you never acknowledged that there was a difference between 14 and 18 year olds\n Having 14 year olds go to butt plug, fisting and semen swallowing classes could lead their peers and older youths forcing them to do things they do not want to do.\n \n If the teachers say that these practices are ok the other children could put pressure on them to perform them.\n So dont tell me that you are a moral person.\n I suggested that the correct response to these questions was to suggest that they do not practise dangerous sexual techniques and your response to my suggesting that was ridicule.\n \n Teaching children what you suggest will lead to them being forced to do something that they maybe do not want to do but you cant see this..\n \n That is why I believe this view to be child grooming by proxy.\n I am not being polite to you. I am trying to explain something to you..dont get confused\n\n \n I'm a moral person. We can also talk about how people shouldn't be pressured into doing what they don't want to do. I don't see how not talking about sex is going to prevent young people from being pressued by peers to do what they don't want to do, or are not ready for. There are many ways to come by that knowledge, some less ideal than others. Talking about it, including possible negative consequences and many other things to consider before you decide to do it, will lead to better choices and less peer pressure.\n \n I am really getting disgusted with being connected with child grooming, when there is no cause for it. I've told the moderators that they should warn you, or you will be banned. I guess they didn't. This will be my last post for this group. Take that as a victory if you wish. I will miss many wonderful people here. Jitobear, foundit66, jazyjason, Mr.Write LA, and others, I wish you all the very best. Thank you for much insight and inspiration.",
