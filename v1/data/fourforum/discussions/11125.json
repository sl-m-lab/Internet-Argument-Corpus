   "Yes, you should switch, to double your chances of success. As this thread has been dead for a month, I'm going to post up the reasoning. I've been tempted to do this for a while...\n \n Consider the possible outcomes of the first choice. Because there is only one prize but three doors, you must have a 1 in 3 chance of picking the right door and a corresponding 2 in 3 chance of picking the incorrect door.\n \n However, the host then removes an 'empty' door. This means that there are only two doors left, one of which has a prize and one of which doesn't. As such, if you switch doors then you are guaranteed to go from prize to not-prize, or vice versa, from not-prize to prize. This means that, should you switch, the 1/3 chance of picking the prize door from the first choice becomes a 1/3 chance that you will switch to an empty door. Equally, the 2/3 chance that you miss the prize door on your first choice becomes a 2/3 chance that you will switch from that empty door to the prize one.\n \n Thus if you switch you have a 2/3 chance of getting the correct door, compared to the 1/3 chance of failure. However, if you decide to stick with the same door then all you have is the 1/3 chance of success from your first choice - halving your chances.\n \n A more diagrammatical approach is shown below. In it, 'P' indicates a door with a prize, 'E' indicates an empty door, and the bolded letter indicates your currently selected door.\n \n SWITCH\n \n PEE ------< one E removed -----< PE\n EPE ------< one E removed -----< EP\n EEP ------< one E removed -----< EP\n \n 2/3 chance of winning.\n \n STICK\n \n PEE ------< one E removed -----< PE\n EPE ------< one E removed -----< EP\n EEP ------< one E removed -----< EP\n \n 1/3 chance of winning.",

   "I think the explanation is poor because it does matter that one door is already open. Your explanation assumes the door that is open has or can switch. This isn't the case because when asked to switch you already have an open door. \n \n The problem I was having (or rather I should state the most confusing part of the problem) is that when asked to switch you know what door is open. So if it is door 3 then door 3 can't be the one you picked.

If he/she didn't then it would be 50/50. Basically it is because the host has to pick a goat that your chances increase. There is a 2/3rds chance you will get a goat when you first pick which means you have the ability to switch you have a 2/3rds chance of winning. Why? Because there was a 66% chance you are on a goat...one goat is shown because the car couldn't be picked.

Instead, you are making one stretched out decision with additional information half-way through the decision-making process - so the initial number of doors is important.\n \n Look at it a different way - assume that you have decided, pre-game, that you are going to pick an arbitrary door and then switch. If you initially get the prize door then you will switch away from it, so you will lose. If, however, you arbitrarily pick either of the two empty doors then when you switch it will be to the prize door, as the other empty door is guaranteed to have been removed. Thus you have a 2/3 chance of winning, as you have a 2/3 chance of initially picking an empty door.\n \n Obviously, if you decide pre-game not to switch then you will have an initial 1/3 chance of getting the prize door, and this will not change because the extra information provided by the host will not have affected your decision.\n \n Now, does it really matter at what point during the game you decide how to act?

The host is not giving you any new information here - you could just imagine him as having said that and nothing would have changed.\n \n The host's interaction in the original scenario is important, however, because it is guided by you. If you pick one of the empty doors then the host must remove the other empty door, regardless of what his original intentions were.

Since you already have some information about them (that choosing door X results in the removal of door Y), the probabilities are altered. Knowledge can alter probability, with the mos obvious example being that if you knew which door to open then you would have a 1/1 chance of getting the prize regardless of how many doors there were.\n \n \n I think next we're going to have to look at the proof that 0.999... = 1.

What you're not taking into account is that once you have A) decided your strategy and B) chosen your door everything else is set in stone. The host always opens a door, are you saying that if you don't switch you'll still win half the time? If you only had a 1/3 chance of picking the right door on your first guess, how can that suddenly become 1/2 just because another door was opened? Think of it this way. Instead of 3 doors, go with 100. You pick one, host opens 98 to show that they're empty. At the start you had a 1/100 chance of having picked the right door, can you really say that it's a 1/2 shot that you picked the right door at the end? Remeber, there will always be at least 98 blank doors for the host to open; you're not forcing his hand in the least.",

   "Kronus and Iangb said some very helpful things to remind me why I previously understood the answer as \"switch\".\n \n I went to the Wikipedia web-site and saw the Bayesian analysis for it.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_hall_problem\n Woah! Flashbacks!\n \n I loved this comment: \"When first presented with the Monty Hall problem an overwhelming majority of people assume that each door has an equal probability and conclude that switching does not matter (Mueser and Granberg, 1999). Out of 228 subjects in one study, only 13% chose to switch (Granberg and Brown, 1995:713). In her book The Power of Logical Thinking, vos Savant (1996:15) quotes cognitive psychologist Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini as saying \"... no other statistical puzzle comes so close to fooling all the people all the time\" and \"[realize] that even Nobel physicists systematically give the wrong answer, and that they insist on it, and they are ready to berate in print those who propose the right answer.\"\"\n \n I think the biggest help was this statement: Kronus: \"If you only had a 1/3 chance of picking the right door on your first guess, how can that suddenly become 1/2 just because another door was opened?\"\n \n There are some simulation web-sites for this at the bottom of this web-page\n http://www.decisionhelper.com/montyhall.htm\n If you try it, you WILL find that you are right 1/3 of the time by \"staying\".\n \n \n Incidentally, if you want to go for the bonus round, try wrapping your head around understanding why \"If the host doesn't know where the prize is, switching has no advantage\". emoticon_xgood",

So if you always switch then 2/3 of the time you will start with the wrong door, but then switch to the right one and win.\n\n \n This is really the greatest way to explain it.
