   "Here is an excert of an article explaining how the acceptance of homosexuality has lowered the teen suicide rate. I have said forever and a day now how the christian right wings message against gays is the root of teen suicide rates for gay youth. Hopefully someday we will find a way to shut them up completely so gay youth don't grow up with such self hatered taught by the right wing. \n \n Source:http://www.azcentral.com/families/articles/0611suicide-cdc11.html\n \n CDC researchers did not immediately know why the overall rate dropped, but a specialist in adolescent medicine said new safety measures for keeping guns out of children's hands and greater acceptance of gays may have played important roles. \n \n Sexual orientation has been a factor in many suicides among young males, said Dr. Charles Wibbelsman, chief of the Teenage Clinic of Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco.\n \n \"There are shows (concerning gays and lesbians) today that weren't on nine years ago,\" said Wibbelsman, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on adolescents. \"It's been much more 'out' and in that respect, we've saved a lot more people's lives.\"",

I wonder. :\n \n \"A boy doesn't say he's trying to lose weight,\" Riggs says. \"He says he's trying to get strong.\"\n \n It's also harder to recognize male anorexics because boys don't usually talk about the problem. If they did, many of them believe, people might think they were feminine or gay.\n \n http://www.projo.com/health/content/projo_20041031_31anor.23c4c4.html\n \n Kids (and adults) are always saying \"that's so gay\" and it is meant to be a bad thing. Youths here that and they respond. It can be damaging to a kid growing up knowing he is gay. He has learned that what he is, is a bad thing. It becomes a visicious cycle.",
