The term alloy is almost always used incorrectly these days, especially amongst bicyclists. They use the term to mean aluminum. What the term alloy really means is a mixture of metals, any kind of metals. Almost all metal used today is a mixture and therefore an alloy.\n \n Most steel has other metals added to tune its properties, like strength, corrosion resistance, or ease of fabrication. Steel is just the element iron that has been processed to control the amount of carbon. Iron, out of the ground, melts at around 1510 degrees C (2750\u00b0F). Steel often melts at around 1370 degrees C (2500\u00b0F).\n \n Author:\n \n Brian Kross, Chief Detector Engineer\n\n What's the melting point of steel?\n \n Just a few facts and figures for the unscientific.",
