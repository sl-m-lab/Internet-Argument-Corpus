Don Branum says the new area, featuring a circle of stone formed by inner and outer rings, will join other worship areas on campus for Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims and Buddhists.\n \n Tech. Sgt. Brandon Longcrier, who became a Pagan after joining the academy, worked with the chapel to create the new site and asked the public to \"treat it as you would any other religious structure.\"\n \n \"There really haven't been any obstacles for the new circle,\" he said. \"The chaplain's office has been 100-percent supportive.\"\n \n One of the chaplains, Lt. Col. William Ziegler, said the dedication of the site should be \"another example of celebrating the freedom we enjoy as well as the freedom we, as Airmen, have pledged to defend.\" \n \n",

This is clearly a setback,\" said Mikey Weinstein, a 1977 graduate of the academy. He is founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, and has often tangled with the academy over such issues.\n \n Although he credits the academy's superintendent, Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Gould, with an improved climate of religious tolerance, Weinstein criticized other academy officials as trivializing the incident, which he said was not revealed to cadets.\n \n Rhetorically addressing academy officials, Weinstein said Tuesday, \"It's been two weeks -- were you going to get around to telling them about this horrible thing that happened, and why haven't you?\"\n \n Academy spokesman John Van Winkle said officials reported the situation to those on base and issued a message reiterating the school's policy of religious tolerance and respect.\n \n In a statement, Gould said, \"We absolutely will not stand for this type of destructive behavior. I consider this no different than someone writing graffiti on the Cadet Chapel.\"\n \n In 2004, an academy survey found that many cadets felt that evangelical Christians were imposing their views and harassing non-Christians at the school.\n \n The following year, an Air Force task force determined that there was no overt discrimination but the academy had failed to accommodate the religious needs of some cadets. Since then, the academy has worked to change that, Van Winkle said.\n \n \"It boils down to the key issue of respect -- respect for everyone's right to practice their faith as they choose,\" he said.\n \n Specific steps include the creation of a Cadet Interfaith Council that identifies upcoming religious holidays and helps adjust cadets' schedules to observe them.\n \n The academy -- which also has worship areas for Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Buddhist and Jewish faiths -- already had a designated area for Wiccans, pagans and followers of similar traditions, but it was located on the north end of the 19,000-acre campus and was not easy for cadets to visit, Van Winkle said.\n",

Every major religion has teachings about respecting the earth, including Judeo-Christian religions.\n\n When Alburquerque is mentioned, be assured that there is always a great deal of drugs involved. I knew someone who had been desperately stabbed at one of these gatherings by, it was a man being attacked by a man, and I believe that drugs and gang warfare were involved. The fellow survived, miraculously.\n \n There is a heavy drug trade in that region and a number of years ago, satanism was used as the excuse to knock off inconvenient people.\n \n Unfortunately, New Mexico borders Mexico and the desperate poverty of that nation inculcated by its repressive Christianity plays a major factor in the growth of the drug thugs who kill thousands in Mexico and who have invaded certain cities in the U.S. with their poverty-induced trade. \n \n Remember, this poverty is held in place by a repressive Christianity which supports the oligarchy that rules Mexico with an iron hand and keeps Mexico's people desperate and poor.",
