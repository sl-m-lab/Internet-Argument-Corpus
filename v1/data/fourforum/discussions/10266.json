   "This is only theory. So, don't get your undies all in a bundle. Have an open mind. OK?\n \n Here goes! I was listening to public radio and heard something that I thought was interesting in regard to the possible origin of religion and thought I would pass it on...In a nut shell.\n \n Man as certain things in common with animals. For example: When a dog hears something his ears perk up and he looks around trying to determine the source of the sound. Man's ears don't perk up, but we do look to see where a sound comes from if it is startling or unusual.... Right? We are \"on alert\", with our ears, and our minds tell us it is either OK or something worth us taking a closer look at.\n \n So, what is the reason for this reaction in early man? Could it be an attacker, a rival for his mate, something is amiss or just is it that he is curious OR a combination of reasons? Things frightened him that would not frighten modern man. \n \n Some examples: \n \n 1. Whenever he heard thunder, it startled him because he had no idea what caused thunder.\n 2. There was an eclipse of the sun. \n 3. There was some rustling in a bush. Could it be an animal, a rival or something else?\n 4. A severe storm.\n 5. A volcano erupted.\n 6. An earthquake.\n 7. Torrential rain.\n 8. A hurricane\n \n He was constantly \"On the lookout\" for anything out of the ordinary and was indeed frightened by things which he could not understand what casued them.\n \n Keep in mind that life in that time in history was tenuous to say the least. Therefore, he was in a constant state of alert if he was to survive. \n \n Eventually man developed speech and spoke crudely to his fellow man. They pondered things they had experienced and, as men, were curious about what caused these events. Because they could not explain some of them, they felt that there must be some supernatural reason behind the events. Thus, the possible origin of religion?\n \n Man, throughout history, believed in some sort of god or gods. Therefore, there has to been a need for a supernatural being as an explanation as to why things happened that could not be explained.\n \n As you may know I am an Atheist. However, in this post I am simply giving you a possible explanation as to how religion first came into existence. I am not saying that this post proves there is no god.... There are plenty of arguments that prove that a god does not exist. This is not one of them. I just found it an interesting possibility to explain why man has always needed a god.",

It seems to me that there is a bit TOO MUCH evidence that he did not exist. With that much evidence scientists, philosophers and religious historians would have pick up on it and we would see most of it included in all the \"non-god\" books out there. But, we don't. So I believe that there may be some fabrication here? In addition, the writer states that Christians point to four ancient philosophers as proof that jc did exist in their time and ignores the fact that jc's name was mentioned by them with the exception of one. Who he says was proved to be a fraud.\n \n I will take another view of this segment of his film, gather the names of the various ancient gods he mentions, and do some of my own research to see how much fact is really there? Tempting to jump on his band wagon, but after jumping on, one may fall off?\n \n The World Trade Center: This one takes away from the creditability of the segment about jc. He does not dispute that planes were flown into the buildings. Howevr,he makes a point of saying that bombs took down the building, not the planes. Does he have any idea how much explosives and preparation of the buildings would be needed to take down them down? MASSIVE!! In addition, the demolition experts would have to get to each of the supporting columns ON EACH floor in order to place the explosives DIRECTLY on the steel beams. How long would it take to accomplish this? MONTHS!!!... Without any one seeing them?! Further, it would have to be a MASSIVE conspiracy. On a scale never seen before, in history, by government officials. I say, \"Nonsense\"! :xbanghead \n \n The Central Bank: Does the bank profit from wars? Yes, as does most of industry does. Do they conspire to start wars? \"NO\". To state, or imply, this is just plain wrong. Again, the conspiracy would have to be on a massive scale!\n \n He brings up some interesting points that require some further investigation. However, on the whole, I believe that he builds a house of cards on a few facts. Just like the religious zealots do. Giant leaps of faith (pardon the pun.) He may just be one of those (intelligent) nuts out there? Just my opinion of course. emoticon_frazzled",

They must think they are acting as servants to some higher authority.\n\n Perhaps this describes John Q. Public in our modern society in an industrialized and civilized nation, but caveman Zog might have seen things a little differently. \n \n Us internet surfing, Ipod wearing, Navigator driving folks of the 21st century do not have to hunt for our food. It has already been done for us, and placed in grocery stores. We now hunt with a basket and credit card instead of rocks and pointy sticks. Man on the whole probably kills more than ever if you think about it. Except now, we have neat little places called slaughter houses and processors that do it for us. Chickens, lambs, sheep, cows, fish, etc. all killed to fill our fat, overstuffed bellies. Our population has grown so large and so gluttonous in our eating habits that nature can no longer provide the food that we need. We now must raise animals specifically to kill them so that John Madden can eat his quarter pounder and Rosie O'Donnell can have her late night bucket of chicken. \n \n Back in Zog's day, Zog only killed what he needed to survive (a bird here, deer there, fish here, stegosaurus there if you are SS, EDO, or Archangel...but I digress). The population was small, and Zog relied on nature to produce the food, which he and Grok killed without guilt, remorse, or compunction. Zog did not find an stigma in killing since he did so merely for survival. Then again, Zog had not met JC and his merry bunch of joy-kill's either. They seem to have put the dampers on the whole killing thing, which depending on which branch you subscribe to could mean that killing an animal is wrong regardless, or killing and animal not needed for food is wrong, or killing a human under any circumstances is a sin, or murder of another human is wrong. \n \n I would be willing to say that religion is one of the key (not only) factors in our modern taboo towards killing. I can assure you that this attitude has not been around forever. If you want proof, have yourself dropped off deep in the tundra with only a rifle and ammunition. You will either starve to death, or kill to survive. Perhaps, due to your conditioning, you might feel guilty about the first rabbit you shoot, but this guilt would soon disappear as your instinct for survival kicked in. \n \n I would not go so far as to say that humans have a \"love of killing\", but historically, we certainly had no reservations about it. When it comes to survival, guilt usually takes a back seat.",

Often with one side admitting something will never work, so long as humans remain the same. Thus, an inate desire to change what humanity is.\n This is common with communism or anarchy for example.\n \n As to children, I've raised 4 and have a lot of contact with children as well as a grasp of psychology.\n Children don't typically feel guilt unless they are slowly programed through social conditioning. Children left to the streets tend to be near animalistic in approach, only caring about those who directly do something for themselves.\n Guilt isn't something a child has naturally.\n When fighting over said toy, they don't initially care about how the opponents feels. Constant contact with others and teaching the child consequences of their actions and empathy and sypathy is needed to have them grow up to be 'normal' or socially acceptable. Some get this conditioning more than others. Some societies favor it more than others. Machismo social groups don't put much emphasis on being a guilty feeling cry baby and will often work in reverse to ensure such isn't fosteted but that other, favored traits are.\n \n It's quite interesting to study these groups from time to time.\n Questioning whether the communist chinese child who denounced family and teachers to the party actually felt guilty or prideful for doing so.\n \n \n In the west, guilt is a very effective tool for social compliance enforcement. Thus, guilt trips are constantly bandied about.\n \"don't your feel bad about genocide?\" \"about the ecocaust that you're causing to mother earth?\" \"about the lead paint your company puts on children's toys?\" \"about not saying you're sorry for your second hand smoke you expelled 50 miles away from me?\"\n \n In other societies, fear and might are used for social compliance. \"Do it or I'll #### you up!\"\n \n When these social tools started to be used is anyones guess but, they have been heightened over the years.\n \n Does differing religious beliefs play a role in this too? Probably.\n \"Stop making baby Jesus cry.\" \"You should be ashamed for touching yourself there, God destests that.\" \"Don't you feel bad that Jesus had to die for you? Shouldn't you do something in treturn?\"\n Differing sects of Christianity use the guilt trip more successfully than others. \n \n \n But, on their own, children are close to a blank slate. It's what their parents and society pours into them that will typically affect how they'll turn out.\n Some children may be more predisposed than others. And in the case of the psychopath, might not be able to be. \n Oh the potentials...\n \n And no result is good or evil in itself. Those are value judgements made upon personal desires.",

Common themes within shamanism include forest spirits, animal spirits and ingestion of intoxicating substances. \n There is often knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants in the environment passed through generations of shamen, probably originally derived by accident or trial and error. \n Amongst tribes which are contacted by the developed world it is common for the tribesmen to consult their shamen whether or not they should trust the outsiders. The shamen obviously holds a privileged position within tribal society, though this is often inherited so ambition may not play such a great role as in western civilisation.",

No regrets for being stupid which might lead to indecision in the future.\n\n \n I'd 100% agree with that from my personal observations of contemporary 'prophets'.\n They through enough of **it against the wall, what sticks is touted as confirmation of their gifts and powers. All the (often massive amounts) of incorrect predictions are down played or, deftly twisted to mean something else to get further confirmation.\n \n \n \n I'm sure Ripskar would know of the Ork battles.\n There are the victories they brag about...and then the battles they forget about (aka loses).\n So, Orks NEVER lose. ;)",
