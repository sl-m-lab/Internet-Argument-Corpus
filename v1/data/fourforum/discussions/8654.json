   "This story was told by Dr. David R. Kamerschen, the distinguished professor of economics at the University of Georgia\n \n Tax Cuts - A Simple Lesson in Economics\n \n This is how the cookie crumbles. Read it carefully.\n \n Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand. Suppose that every day, ten men go out for dinner. The bill for all ten comes to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:\n -The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing\n -The fifth would pay $1\n -The sixth would pay $3\n -The seventh $7\n -The eighth $12\n -The ninth $18\n -The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59\n \n So, that's what they decided to do. The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve. \"Since you are all such good customers,\" he said, \"I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20.\"\n \n So now dinner for the ten only cost $80. The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. But, what about the other six, the paying customers? how could they divvy up the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his \"fair share?\" \n \n The six men realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth and the sixth man would each end up being \"paid\" to eat their meal. So the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.\n And so: -The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings)\n -The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings)\n -The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% savings)\n -The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings)\n -The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings)\n -The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings)\n \n Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.\n \"I only got a dollar of the $20,\" declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth. \"But he got $10!\"\n \"Yeah, that's right,\" exclaimed the fifth man. \"I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got ten times more than me!\" \"That's true!\" shouted the seventh man. \"Why should he get $10 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!\"\n \n \"Wait a minute,\" yelled the first four men in unison. \"We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!\"\n The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.\n \n The next night the tenth man didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill.\n \n And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up at the table anymore. There are lots of good restaurants in Europe and the Caribbean.",

I am new to these forums and I didn't see it anywhere but I can't say I looked that hard. \n \n Anyway, who provides the jobs for the poorer people? Usually the rich. Why should people want to bite the hand that feeds many of them. Giving tax breaks allows for more people to have jobs, thus creating more productivity, thus increased competition, thus the driving down of prices, thus a higher standard of living. But I will grant that there do need to be some taxes for the government as long as they continue to be regulated by the Laffer Curve.

   "I have no objection in principle to the laffer curve, but the point you miss is that the US and most of Europe are nowhere near the tipping point on that curve. The laffer curve is always quote by right wingers trying to claim that you can cut taxes and increase revenues, but they fail to recall that no-one has pinpointed where the tipping point is. The biting the hand that feeds them analogy works but you have it the wrong way round. The poor feed the wealthy - have you looked at the average profit per employee in a corporation compared to the average wage? You're looking at a ratio of 10:1 in many cases.\n \n Trickle down economics of the sort you advocate doesn't work very well. You have to remember that most of the well off aren't entrepreneurs, all that will happen is that they will pocket the extra money and live off the interest. If you spend it on infrastructure or on taking costs like healthcare away from the poorest in society, you get far more bang for your buck, as people living from pay cheque to pay cheque are far more likely to plough the money straight into the economy and it will go round 3-4 times for the once the wealthy will put it through.",

   "The point with the laffer curve is that there is a point where increased taxes will slow the economy so much that tax revenues will go down. I think the experience of the government in this country has been that recent tax rises (such as the rise in national insurance contributions) has boosted revenues for the government, proving that we are below the tipping point. What the laffer curve does not guarantee is that the economy itself will be boosted by higher taxes, though judicious spending can achieve this according to Keynesian theories. My guess is that the situation in the US is similar too, given that, like the UK, you have one of the lowest tax burdens in the developed world (look at % GDP figures compared to France, Germany, Sweden etc.).",

Wal-Mart alone employs 1.3 Million. These folks work for the late Sam Walton who was, by most accounts, a rich individual rather than a corporate entity. \n \n Ford Motor Company employs roughtly 350,000. Henry Ford was rather well off.\n \n General Electric and General Electric each employ roughly 350,000. These Generals are not military generals and do not work for the gubment or the dreaded George W. They work for a handful of people who are...rich.\n \n Ronald McDonald, that wealthy clown employs roughly half a million by himself. \n \n United Parcel Service employs another 370,000 employees doing the same thing as a federal agency for less money. \n \n And so forth and so on...\n \n Now as to the rich not paying any taxes: The top marginal tax rate in the nation is 35% (which I should point out is also the top marginal corporate tax rate). Add to that, state and local income taxes (which are higher for the rich based on total income). Throw in property taxes (presumably higher for the rich given the likelihood of larger homes and cars), Then add sales taxes (also presumably higher for the rich who have more disposable income for goods).\n \n But wait: There's more!\n Estate taxes, capital gains taxes, gasoline taxes: The rich pay em all! There was no special pump at the gas station for the rich that offered discount gas prices last I fueled up. \n \n Wow....",

   "If you are exploited in today's world you lack imagination indeed. No one in the US is held against their will in a job from which they cannot escape. I believe the same is correct of the UK unless there has been a massive cover of which I am unaware.\n \n If you begin with the supposition that government seizure of 35% of income is too low, then I do not see us getting very far at all. But then, it was that difference of opinion that led to the separation of our nations to begin with. A cursory glance over the past couple of centuries finds that our nation has done rather well and has done so through the economic might propelled by the likes of JP Morgan, Andrew Carnegie and other tycoons of the industrial age. Where would we be if your oppressive tax burdens and antiquated notions of class envy had been yoked upon them and this nation? Indeed, where would Europe be? \n \n You seem to proceed from the premise that the rich \"owe\" something to the gubment. I wonder if you gaze then upon the fat man and believe that he gained his girth by stealing weight from the thin man. It is not the Gubment that drives the economic engine it capital. Capital is provided by those who possess it, nominally called da' Rich. Gubment rather is the sludge that slows the economic engine. \n \n Take my income and give to someone else and what becomes of my incentive to work? Can you blame me for seeking a haven? I should simply seek to be mugged under cover of night to cut out the government middleman.\n \n Your solution would be to remove capital from those who have it and give it to those who do not through whatever means necessary. Once a level playing field is established, I suppose there will be no future gains as no other individual will ever gain a competitive advantage over the other. \n \n The basic disagreement then boils down to how the rich become rich. You would seem to hold that they got that way through dishonest means whereas I, in my long slow climb towards wealth, have seen every attempt by folks such as yourself to seize my income as patently dishonest. I have scrapped and scraped for every dollar. I am not rich, by my standard, but perhaps I am by yours. That alone is a sobering thought.",

   "Have you thought through your demand for the redistribution of income and rewards in order to achieve the social objectives you favour?\n \n Redistribution could happen in two ways: \n \n 1). By direct state control over prices and incomes - which would usually involve a command economy and public ownership of the means of production because questions of redistribution can't be separated from questions of ownership.\n \n 2). By progressive taxation designed to make sure that the gap between the highest and lowest paid would be narrowed by a heavier burden of taxes on the 'well off'. \n \n But progressive taxation involves questions of justice that are not easily brushed aside, because it compels the rich to forfeit not just a higher amount but a larger proportion of their income. There is also an argument that progressive taxation will discourage people whose earning capacity is related to their social functions. In other words, higher taxes at the top end could reduce the incentive of the most useful in taking on the work that is required from them. This could have a number of negative economic consequences - the most obvious of which is increased unemployment.\n \n James.",

   "\"Are you seriously telling me that gambling with a good percentage chance of winning (which is all shareholding really is, it's not dissimilar to betting on horses with an incompetent bookmaker) is working for a living?\" \n \n Yes I am telling you in all seriousness that the person who invests money in companies through stock purchase is providing a boon to the economy. If you conclude that investing is tantamount to gambling, I would agree, but what business venture does not involve risk? Those who invest wisely see a positive return on their money. Those who invest with the incompetent bookmaker do poorly. This is one of many reasons that some are rich and some are poor, but I would not want gubment guarantees on investing, OR horse racing. \n \n \"There is no work of hand or brain that is worth more than, say, GBP100k a year. \"\n \n To this I will merely state \"NUTS.\" Tell me why the Beatles should not be fabulously wealthy for the impact they have had on music, indeed the world? Explain why Ringo's Royalties should be somehow tied to those of a local turnip farmer. It boggles the very senses. \n \n \"Invoking the market is a total cop-out, as there perfect market theorised by economists does not exist.\" \n \n This is so incredibly patently and demonstrably false I stutter to try to respond. Have you never negotiated a raise based on what value you have brought the company? Here's a test: Take out a want ad in the local paper advertising that you wish to hire an attorney and that you will pay $10/hr. How many attorneys will take the job? 0. Why? The market. The attorney has the opportunity to make more money elsewhere and thus is not enraptured by your offer. The attorney has this option because of the education possessed and the services that this education allows him to deliver. If you have no skills, you cannot demand higher pay. Having no skills is no justification for seizing the assets of those who have skills. If you feel that you truly have no ability to impact how much money you make, you need idea redistribution, not income redistribution. \n \n \"Like it or not, the class system exists - if your parents are wealthy you will likely be wealthy, and chances are that both you and your parents will live longer, healthier lives than someone who is worse off than you.\" \n \n I am living proof of your error. I am the son of fourth generation farmers from South Carolina. I lived in a trailer with no running water and worked minimum wage. Now that I have two pennies to rub together after years of scraping, I do not want to simply hand you one. Get your own. \n \n \"Do you really think George W Bush got to be president of the united states because he was the best person to lead the US? Of course not, he was manouvered into position because his dad had been President and he was a willing shill of both the religious right and big business.\" \n \n Irrelevent to the discussion of tax rates. \n \n \"Social mobility in the US and UK is hideously low, government intervention increases social mobility.\" \n \n Oh my dear lady please. Gubment intervention is the least likely method of increased social mobility. Education is the single greatest tool at achieving increased income. The Gubment ALREADY pays for 12 years of education in this country. Join the military and the gubment will pay ye to get your college degree. Despite the free educational opportunities provided many simply choose not to apply themselves.\n \n \n \"Do you really the head of Ikea was discouraged from building his company by high taxes in Sweden?\" \n \n Is Ikea the best example of the industrial might of countries with high tax rates?\n \n \"Redistribution of wealth increases social mobility, raises life expectancy, creates a more active citizenry and enhances social cohesion. Capitalism is only any good for increasing average wealth, and average wealth means nothing when 5% of the people have 95% of the wealth.\"\n \n Vehicle ownership increases mobility; therefore, the gubment must provide transportation I suppose. Turning you telly off increases your intelligence; therefore, the gubment should eliminate television sets, or at least ensure that they are all the same size. It wouldn't be fair for one person to have a larger TV than the other. Midgets have more room in airplane seats! Unfair to tall folks!!! This train of thought can go on for miles before colliding head on with reason. Eating your vegetables will increase your life expectancy a lot faster than taking money out of my wallet.

I didn't realize there were no rich people before 1896. \n \n Why be bothered by facts when you can merely prattle on without them. Well here are some figures for you to pass around the commune:\n \n http://www.econstats.com/weo/C172V029.htm\n \n A cursory glance at the table reveals that unemployment went from a high of 9.7% in 1982 to a low of 5.5% the year Reagan left office. That is a reduction of almost 50%. Facts can be such stubborn things...\n \n According to the Cato Institute:\n \u0095Real economic growth averaged 3.2 percent during the Reagan years versus 2.8 percent during the Ford-Carter years and 2.1 percent during the Bush-Clinton years. \n \u0095Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. \n \u0095Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. \n \n So Reaganomics, according to the above increased your chance of being employed, increased your median family income AND decreased the rate of inflation all while giving you a tax cut. \n \n Funny thing about that caveman commune of yours is that the cavedude who developed superior hunting skills ended up having more to trade than the guy who painted the cave walls.",

I didn't realize there were no rich people before 1896. \n \n Why be bothered by facts when you can merely prattle on without them. \n\n \n I snagged this from a reaganomics debate on http://www.youdebate.com/DEBATES/REAGANOMICS.HTM\n \n A few breaths of fresh air about Reaganomics:\n \n According to the Statistical Abstract of the United States for 1996, the number of people (white, black, and Hispanic) below the poverty level increased in almost every year between 1981 (31.8 million) and 1992 (39.3 million).\n \n We were $994 billion in debt in fiscal 1981, when Carter left off, and $2,867 billion when Reagan leaves office in fiscal 1989. The rough number is 2.85 times as much in 1989 as in 1981. No, it's not quite tripled, but very close. Okay, so the republicans have an argument for this: it didn't really double or triple when you take it as a percentage of either GDP or GNP. Okay, if we go with that, then it can indeed be agreed that Reagan didn't really double the debt as a percentage of either of these figures. But that doesn't really make Reagan look any better. As a historical look at the debt since before the United States entered World War II will show, the debt as a percentage of GDP never went up meaningfully for any extended period of time except for two periods: during the War itself, and starting during the Reagan years. At least President Roosevelt had the need to borrow money hand and fist to fight the Axis powers. What's Reagan's excuse? We needed to borrow money to give a tax break to the wealthy?\n \n The trade deficit quadrupled. (no big deal I guess. We can all flip burgers instead of growing our own food and producing our own goods)\n \n The 1986 Tax Reform Act is widely considered to be the best piece of American tax legislation since the adoption of the income tax. It is the opposite of Reaganomics. Over its first five years, it closed more than $500 billion in loopholes and tax shelters. As a result:\n \n * Major U.S. corporations that previously had paid little or nothing in income taxes due to loopholes were put back on the tax rolls, and corporate taxes were increased overall by a net of more $100 billion over five years.\n * A huge wasteful tax-shelter industry for high-income individuals was shut down.\n * Tax rates on capital gains income were raised to the same level as on other income.\n * Millions of moderate-income working families got tax relief through a major expansion of the earned-income tax credit.\n * Taxes on most families (on average, all but the best-off tenth) were reduced. (The table shows the tax changes by income group.)\n * The income tax was substantially simplified for most filers.\n \n \n Remember: the great depression never ended. It was just covered up by social programs, weapons sales, and CONSTANT miliarism since 1942.",

Cuba: I have never heard of an American swimming shark infested waters to reach the Communist utopia. The opposite seems to occur daily. North Korea: Insert joke here.\n \n How many diseases have been cured by socialist nations? How many inventions have come from behind the iron curtain? \n \n How has society failed you? From my vantage, I have more freedom of movement, freedom of economic pursuit, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom from want than I would in any of the socialist nations you would have us become. All I get from you is a sense of envy of those who have achieved more than you. Why not develop a sense of aspiration from the accomplishments of others rather than casting dispersions on their efforts. I do not make universal statements about the poor, why do you then assume that the wealthy are somehow universally evil? If money is truly evil, you should not wish for the poor to elevate their station in life as it would mean a loss of virtue. Indeed, you should donate your computer to charity, rend your clothing and live in the woods with the nut hording evil squirrels. \n \n Without getting too personal, perhaps you could share some of your life's circumstances to explain your peculiar vantage point. I am curious to learn how such an ethos develops being as it is so diametrically opposed to my own.",

   "Hardly shocking when you realize that the total US population increased from 229 million to 255 million during the same period. You might also mention that the total number of rich and the total number of people with green eyes increased as well. Factual yes, causal no.\n \n Lets put those numbers into perspective. By the numbers we have mutually agreed upon, it can be determined that the percentage of people below the poverty line in 1981 was 13%, and in 1992 this was 15.72%, a clear increase, even when we consider the population increase.\n \n Russian autoworkers carried pictures of the cars they made for two reasons: 1: They made so few due to inefficiency....The US Postal service is nationalized. Federal Express is private. The US Postal service is running a deficit. Fed Ex is running a profit. Whose employees have the higher morale?.......Russia itself collapsed under the weight of its own economic morass.\n \n Governement deficit and innecficency for both the United States and the Soviet Union can be attribted to military expenditures. As you may know, in 2005, The United States outspent every other nation in the world in defense costs. China came in second place in this study, and they only spent 1/7 of what the United States spent! Pertaining to the Soviet Union, its easy to see that they went bankrupt because of the arms race. After WWII, the United States became the most powerful and richest country in the world. Around the same time, the O.S.S. became the C.I.A., the agency that would contribute most to Soviet ruin. The USSR was obliterated by Germany during the war, and they spent the rest of their existence trying to rebuild (Russia is STILL trying to finish the work). The American government knew that if they outspent the Soviet Union, the country would eventually go broke, as it did in the early 1990's. The fall of the Soviet Union was straegic and very wasteful military spending by the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan administrations. The stategy works so well that our current budget for defense is close to half a trillion dollars, more than the budget of most nations.\n \n Lets see how socialist nations were taken out by the west:\n \n Yes, Lets get into that. With confidence, I would say it is easy to overthrow a popular democratically elected government (ie. Left/Liberal, Centrsist or some right/conservative governements), and difficult to overthrow a Totalitarian or Fascist regimes. We see this in Iraq. Saddam Hussein ran a totaalitarian regime through the presidencies of Reagan, Bush 1 and Clinton. The war in Iraq has been going on for years now, and the stability provided by the Hussein regime was taken away by the coalition forces that invaded.\n \n Socialist Nations taken out by the west would include the overthrow of the Allende government in Chille (Allende was a commited Marxist), The weapons race against the USSR, which I already addressed, Guatemala(CIA overthrows the democratically elected Jacob Arbenz in a military coup. Arbenz has threatened to nationalize the Rockefeller-owned United Fruit Company, in which CIA Director Allen Dulles also owns stock. Arbenz is replaced with a series of right-wing dictators whose bloodthirsty policies will kill over 100,000 Guatemalans in the next 40 years). Bolivia -(After half a decade of CIA-inspired political turmoil, a CIA-backed military coup overthrows the leftist President Juan Torres. In the next two years, dictator Hugo Banzer will have over 2,000 political opponents arrested without trial, then tortured, raped and executed).\n \n \n In Argentina, Redistribution of wealth during the presidencies of Peron (who, as a minister of a dictatorship took all the measures that had been proposed by the Socialist Party in order to accumulate personal political capital)(4) made Argentina a country with 4.2 per cent unemployment in 1974,(5) a 9 per cent poverty rate (lower than France and the US), with a better distribution of wealth than any other Latin American country and even many industrialized countries.(6) Yet the traditional agro-exporting elite, with deep roots in the military and the powerful Roman Catholic Church, would not give up easily, and used their power to overthrow democratic governments six times in five decades. Between 1930 and 1974, while Argentina was struggling to move away from the model of agro-export towards one of industrialization, capitalism was being transfigured from an emphasis on productive capital to one on financial capital.",

By the numbers we have mutually agreed upon, it can be determined that the percentage of people below the poverty line in 1981 was 13%, and in 1992 this was 15.72%, a clear increase, even when we consider the population increase. \n \n Frankly, I didn't expect you to pick up on the percentage increase. I underestimated you. Well done sir. However, you now expect me to grant you that Reaganomics was a crushing failure after a 2.72% increase in poverty over an 11 year period followed a population increase of 11%. But then, with an even population distribution you would expect an increase at all points of the income range. That is why it is called a bell curve. But how were the deniznes of Mother Russia doing? In 1989, between 16 and 25% of the population fell below the poverty level of 75 rubles per year. http://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/complabstuds/russia/Russia.doc If you were a communal farmer in the Rodina, you fared far worse. fully 39% were below the poverty line. So regardless of how much pride was in the Russian automotive industry it was not doing anyone much good. But I forget, the problems in socialist regimes are due to western meddling... \n \n Governement deficit and innecficency for both the United States and the Soviet Union can be attribted to military expenditures. \n \n You were just advocating that the gubment was more efficient at budgetary matters than the private sector as you pined away for that socialist utopia. How then did the gubment suddenly become inefficient? \n \n As you may know, in 2005, The United States outspent every other nation in the world in defense costs. China came in second place in this study, and they only spent 1/7 of what the United States spent! Pertaining to the Soviet Union, its easy to see that they went bankrupt because of the arms race. \n \n But presumably those socialist governments would be full of happy workers who would produce equipment and arms more efficiently then their capitalist enemies...wait, this is getting hard to follow...\n \n \n After WWII, the United States became the most powerful and richest country in the world. \n \n You say that as if it's a bad thing.\n \n Around the same time, the O.S.S. became the C.I.A., the agency that would contribute most to Soviet ruin. \n \n Actually, the communist party was the agency that contributed most to Soviet ruin. If the communist system was the better system, why was it so easy to tear down from within? Ah yes...Western meddling in a perfect society. \n \n The USSR was obliterated by Germany during the war, and they spent the rest of their existence trying to rebuild (Russia is STILL trying to finish the work). The American government knew that if they outspent the Soviet Union, the country would eventually go broke, as it did in the early 1990's.

The stategy works so well that our current budget for defense is close to half a trillion dollars, more than the budget of most nations.\n \n Europe was obliterated by Germany during the War. But again, Western meddling. So the US cheated and the best form of government, the socialist ideal was snuffed out...or something...Perhaps you forget which side of the Berlin Wall the people were jumping to?\n \n Lets see how socialist nations were taken out by the west:\n \n Yes, Lets get into that. With confidence, I would say it is easy to overthrow a popular democratically elected government (ie. Left/Liberal, Centrsist or some right/conservative governements), and difficult to overthrow a Totalitarian or Fascist regimes. \n \n So because Hitler was so difficult to defeat his form of government is preferred? Dictators and roaches can be difficult to kill, but I'm inviting neither to my next tea party. \n \n We see this in Iraq. Saddam Hussein ran a totaalitarian regime through the presidencies of Reagan, Bush 1 and Clinton. The war in Iraq has been going on for years now, and the stability provided by the Hussein regime was taken away by the coalition forces that invaded.\n \n Stability...Yes, yes I see. The trains were marvelously efficient in Italy under Mussolini. Hitler was admittedly efficient at other things...Yes, dictators can exert tight control over all facets of society. But at what cost? Precisely how many communist regimes have endured longer than the US or UK form of government? Ah... No fair, we cheated.\n \n In Argentina, Redistribution of wealth during the presidencies of Peron (who, as a minister of a dictatorship took all the measures that had been proposed by the Socialist Party in order to accumulate personal political capital)(4) made Argentina a country with 4.2 per cent unemployment in 1974,(5) a 9 per cent poverty rate (lower than France and the US), with a better distribution of wealth than any other Latin American country and even many industrialized countries.(6) Yet the traditional agro-exporting elite, with deep roots in the military and the powerful Roman Catholic Church, would not give up easily, and used their power to overthrow democratic governments six times in five decades. Between 1930 and 1974, while Argentina was struggling to move away from the model of agro-export towards one of industrialization, capitalism was being transfigured from an emphasis on productive capital to one on financial capital.\n \n Ah yes, the tin-pot dictator. Add to your list the governments of Haiti (not exactly an Elysium of Human rights), Guatemala, Bolivia, North Korea, etc etc etc. Not exactly leaders on the world's stage those. Don't get me wrong, a dictatorship can be marvelously beneficial to those on the right side of things. Its just that those on the wrong side tend to become slightly dead. \n \n So you would trade freedom and opportunity for a guarantee. Yes, Dictators can promise security. The caged canary can always count on a meal. Interesting how this has evolved from a discussion on tax rates into a manifesto. But then, perhaps not entirely surprising.\n \n Might I again inquire into your background? Please, I am quite understandably curious. Academia? Time spent in the workforce? \n \n Make my Marx the Groucho variety.",

   "Interesting how this has evolved from a discussion on tax rates into a manifesto.\n \n I must admit that my intentions were not to engage in a tax discussion, but the discussion on the poverty level has proven itself to be interesting.\n \n However, you now expect me to grant you that Reaganomics was a crushing failure after a 2.72% increase in poverty over an 11 year period followed a population increase of 11%. But then, with an even population distribution you would expect an increase at all points of the income range. \n \n One would. but that just didn't happen. If reaganomics had worked, the proportion of those in poverty should have gone down. Business owners were supposed to help the tax cuts \"trickle down\", but most did not. If reaganomics had no effect on the economy at all, 13 to 15 percent of the new additions to the American population would have joined the class of people in poverty.\n Knowing the real effects of Reaganomics, one can determine that 29% of the added population between 1981 and 1992 was put below the poverty line (For Reaganomics to have been neutral, the increase of people in poverty during these 11 years could only be 1.43%). The Reagan theory would only have had a positive effect on the poverty rate if it did not increase by any more than 1.42%\n \n You were just advocating that the gubment was more efficient at budgetary matters than the private sector as you pined away for that socialist utopia. How then did the gubment suddenly become inefficient?\n \n I was advocating exactly that. Public spending is more efficient that private spending. I would say that a government that uses more money on defense than necessary is inefficient. The United States can cut its current military budget in half, and still have enough weapons and military to defend themselves, if necessary. I have not seen any country try to invade America since the second world war. \n \n A private business, if ran the right way, does not need to spend very much money at all on \"defense\". In 2003, The U.S. spent 3.7% of its GDP on defense (404 billion dollars). A private company like British Pertrolium would not spend 10.55 billion dollars of its revenue in court costs (2005 revenue for BP was $285.1 billion). I am sure that Wal-mart doesn't even have to spend 10 billion dollars defending themselves from Neo-liberals and commies.\n \n In reference to my comment [After WWII, the United States became the most powerful and richest country in the world.] you replied:\n \n You say that as if it's a bad thing.\n \n No, I simply state this as a fact to support the claim that the soviets had much more to lose from an arms race than the United States. Im going to illustrate my claim with the numbers. By using the figures of the U.S. GDP in 2005 (12.49 trillion), and the Russian GDP in 2005 (numbers range from 740 billion to 1.589 trillion. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and use the high figure), I discovered that arms spending- dollar for dollar - would currently hurt the Russians 8 times worse than it would the United States. During the 1980's, this would have hurt the soviet Union 3 times as bad as the United States. Russian military spending vs. GDP was 15-17 percent. American military spending vs. GDP was 5-6 percent. Be it 3 times worse or 8, it can be seen and understood that America's inflated defense budget was that way as a strategy to ruin the soviet economy.\n \n Perhaps you forget which side of the Berlin Wall the people were jumping to?\n \n I don't care who you are, tyrant, president, or savior, a leader does not build a wall for no reason at all. I think that any number of these acts of terrorism against East Germany could have led to the erection of the wall in 1961. \n \n *The damaging of Power stations, canals, dams, docks, gas stations, outdoor stands, and shipyards by explosives, arson, short circuiting, and the like.\n *Placement of explosives in a railway bridge in Moscow that would have killed hundreds if not discovered in time\n *7,000 Cows killed as a result of poisoning wire used to bale the cows' corn fodder\n *Promotion of work slow-downs and the arson of a tile factory\n *sink bombs set off to disrupt political meetings\n *forged food ration cards that were distributed. These cards caused shortages and resentment\n *Soap added to powdered milk destined for German schools\n *raids of Left-wing offices in east and west Berlin. From there, the theft of membership cards, assault and kidnapings of Leftists, and the occasional murder to mix things up.\n \n Groups such as \" the fighting group against inhumanity, The association of political refugees from the east, and the investigation of freedom-minded jurists of the soviet zone were the perpetrators of these terrorist acts.\n \n Common sense says an action causes a reaction. I wouldn't dream of trying to convince someone that the Bush administration is building a 700 foot fence along the border of Mexico to trap in American citizens, or that the Chinese built the great wall to keep their citizens from escaping......then again I just might, it could prove to be fun. \n \n These walls were built, or in the case of the fence, are being built, to provide a means for defense.\n \n So because Hitler was so difficult to defeat his form of government is preferred? \n \n No, not at all. I wouldn't go ahead and try to convince you that the majority of North Koreans want the system that they have, or that the majority of Cubans want the system that they have. The point of this statement was to show you that free societies are easier to break apart than Totalitarian or fascist regimes. Cuba and North Korea are subject to dictatorships. You also asked me this:\n \n If the communist system was the better system, why was it so easy to tear down from within? \n \n Because it was a society with more freedom than that of Cuba or North Korea. \n \n Ah yes, the tin-pot dictator. \n \n Peron is a \"tin-pot dictator\". I will give you that much, but lets explore what the meaning of the term \"tin pot\" is.\n \n The Oxford English Dictionary defines \"tin-pot\" as used contemptuously and meaning of low quality. Wikpedia claims that A \"tin pot dictator\" is usually from a third-world country or banana republic. \n \n A Banana republic is a pejorative term for a small, often Latin American or Caribbean country that is politically unstable, dependent on limited agriculture, and ruled by a small, wealthy and corrupt clique put in power by the United States government in conjunction with the CIA and the US business lobby. \n \n Third World countries are not as industrialized or technologically advanced as OECD countries, and therefore in academia, the current term in use is \"developing nation\".Some theorists, such as Andre Gunder Frank and Walter Rodney have used the term underdevelopment or underdeveloped world, to indicate the active process by which the global South [third world] has been locked out of development by imperialism and the post-colonial policies of the richer nations.\n \n Irrelevant to what we are discussing, but interesting nevertheless. Maybe we can go on to argue that Peron was a product of American imperialism.\n \n So you would trade freedom and opportunity for a guarantee. \n \n In the cases of health insurance and energy, I sure would.",
