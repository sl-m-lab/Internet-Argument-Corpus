   "Yes, I am Bush Is The Man. I am apparently getting banned for saying the word \"the\" (sarcasm). \n \n \n Is Kerry a hypocrite? Please try and keep this thread on Kerry, and not others. I just want everyone's point of view of whether Kerry is a hypocrite or not, and why. Thank you.\n \n \n First Instance\n \n In a midnight rally in Ohio (right after Bush's speech at the RNC), Kerry made these comments:\n \n Comment(s) #1\n \"For the past week, they attacked my patriotism and my fitness to serve as commander-in-chief...\"\n \n Comment(s) #2\n \"Well, here's my answer: I'm not going to have my commitment to defend this country questioned by those who refused to serve when they could have and by those who have misled the nation into Iraq.\" \"Misleading our nation into war in Iraq makes you unfit to lead this nation. Doing nothing while this nation loses millions of jobs makes you unfit to lead this nation. Letting 45 million Americans go without health care makes you unfit to lead this nation. Letting the Saudi royal family control our energy costs makes you unfit to lead this nation. Handing out billions of government contracts to Halliburton while you're still on their payroll makes you unfit.\"\n \n \n Analysis: Kerry mistakenly claimed that speakers at the RNC challenged his patriotism and called him unfit to for the presidency. Not once did anyone make those claims. In fact, the audience stood up and applauded his service on numerous occasions throughout the RNC. But this isn't the issue. The issue is that Kerry makes it seem that it's against the rules and wrong to call someone \"unfit\", but what does he do right after saying that...he calls Bush and Cheney \"unfit\". Instance #1 of hypocrisy.\n \n \n \n \n Second Instance\n \n \n Comment(s) #1 (Ohio rally)\n \"We all saw the anger and distortion of the Republican convention...For four days in New York ... we heard almost nothing but anger and insults from the Republicans\"\n \n Comment(s) #2 (DNC speech)\n I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States. \n \n My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, group from group, region from region.\n \n Comment(s) #3 (Ohio rally)\n \"I guess I'll leave it up to the voters whether five deferments makes someone more qualified to defend this nation than two tours of duty.\" \"They can't talk about their record because it's a record of failure.\" \"All hat, no cattle\" \"Wrong war...wrong time...wrong place\"\n \n Analysis: Kerry complains that too many insults are going around, and suggests that everyone take the \"high road\" and quit this stuff. But what does he do...attack Bush and Cheney, and call them \"unfit\". Instance #2 of hypocrisy.",

Apparently Kerry attacks Bush for his lack of compassion and it is a glaring example that Kerry lacks any on a personal level...apparently believing that the only way for a person to be compassionate is to support government programs that show \"compassion\". Kerrry personally could care less for the under-privileged in this country, until he needs some votes. I want to hear the spin from the left now on how BUSH, in giving so much PERSONALLY is NOT compassionate and KERRY, who gives NOTHING, IS compassionate. IS that NOT hypocritical? I honestly don't expect a rational response to that question, but it'll be fun to see the feable attempts at rationalization. \n \n Now, I understand that Kerry has increased his contributions in recent years, but one must wonder what his motivations are..I mean, the \"man\" does nothing unless it makes him look good to the voters...oh wait, he just RECENTLY found his compassion (during the time he was getting ready to run for President...what a coincidence)",

The spirit of the constitution was to keep the federal government limited and defined, and allow the states powers to be unlimited and undefined for things like providing jobs and healthcare and a host of other things.

However, lying involves some degree of intent, as in the poster knowingly posted false information. That's what BITM did, and that crosses a very serious line.\n \n 10th amendment jurisdprudence has severely limited its scope. Court rulings have given the federal government nearly universal power over any commerce related activity (though it can't play legislative Kevin Bacon and relate anything to the ISC, see US v. Lopez and US v. Morrison). Not only that, but the courts have upheld the methodology the US government uses to pass laws such as NCLB (conditional grants) in Printz v. United States (see also South Dakota v. Dole, distinguished). Since the states are free to reject the aid, there is no 10th amendment violation (and with regards to NCLB, many states are seriously considering this option).\n \n The 9th amendment also has almost been forgotten about, but unlike the 10th its revival would spell doom for the modern conservative right (libertarians, by contrast, would be elated). A more vigorous reading of the 9th amendment would not only provide rock-solid justification for the Lawrence and Griswold decisions, but it would also severely limit the government's ability to write any \"morals\" legislation whatsoever (probably leading to the legalization of marijuana and other drugs). At the same time, congress' uncontested power to regulate ISC (and the expansive definition given to it) means that most cases of liberal intervention would not be affected.\n \n But I'll admit, I'm confused as to the claim that Bush has been more helpful to the states. In addition to triggering a near financial crisis in many (and forcing alot to raise taxes), most of his programs are \"top down\" and restrictive on the states (NCLB, Homeland Security spending). Now, I'll admit I'm not much of states-rights kinda guy, so this doesn't concern me too much.

Well, the upper brackets will get hit - IF he can get it through Congress. We're in the mess partly because we spent 4 years without balance of power. I'd like to point out that the Republicans have controlled EVERYTHING and look at the deficit. Yet the Democrats have the reputation. Go figure. GWB's deficit has to come home to roost some time. On that day, Democrats will take the blame.\n \n Let's go back to election 2000. He started out by handing $300 to everybody. At least now we know what it costs to buy an election. Way cheaper than I'd have guessed. I heard him the other day promising more grants for higher education. This was an election 2000 promise, too. Of course, he actually cut them. Now let's talk about who's the hypocit.\n \n I worked for 20 years for a MAJOR payroll processing company. I spent the last 5 years working in the department that serviced companies under 50 employees. I dealt with hundreds of payrolls every week and I learned one thing very quickly. The future of our country had better not lie in the hands of those small businesses. I found the owners to be very short sighted when it came to employee retention and also very greedy. I actually had to deal with one gentleman who gave 10 cent raises and then screamed his head off at the end of the year when HIS bonus check had to be cut on 2 separate checks. You see, the computer couldn't handle that many digits on one check. I lacked sympathy. 401K's!!! You and I both know the criteria for helping the top guy invest the most. The fact that the employees get to contribute too is incidental to the owner. He institutes a 401K because he's the biggest winner.\n \n I'll agree that Social Security isn't great. But 401K's aren't the answer. The employER makes the basic investment choices and the employees are locked into to those choices. And they're not risk free. The difference is that frequently, the employer can stand the risk. The little guy employee can't. I'd prefer more IRA type options where the small invester can go with any choice.\n \n More small businesses. Eliminate Social Security in favor of 401K's. That's GWB's idea. Didn't hear much about that idea when the market slumped, did we. The market is back over 10. His idea is resurfacing.\n \n What I'm trying to show here is that he isn't probusiness. He's pro individuals - if the individuals are on the upper end of the income spectrum. And his marriage amendment certainly isn't pro state's rights.",

The special interest process starts at muni levels, where economic control is often absolute over all demographic groups. From there it goes to state level party committees, where party policy and federal representation are established. At that point, unless one has a great deal of clout, or an issue inflames the public to a point demanding attention, party policies and rhetoric are pretty well set in stone. At the national level big money enters the picture, representing national and international interests. If you have been involved at that level, you'll understand that what the people need or want are issues that really don't mean anything other than platforms for election or re-election purposes. When congress meets, all you're seeing is formalization of deals cut with senatorial and representative committee heads doing the heavy deals while the juniors trade votes. Power at that level is something so dominating that few citizens are aware of how they're actually governed. \n \n In other words, the people have no real power after the county reps go to state level. The machine is well oiled, knows the voting base right down to individual district blocks and isn't particularly concerned about anything but power, money and throwing the public some bones for election purposes.

That doesn't mean that the other 54 didn't read it and sign it with my interpretation. Had James Madison had the votes, the original founding fathers could have clarified. They knew how to make an amendment. They chose not to. Even though they were well aware of your argument. They heard it from the horses mouth and it didn't sway them.\n \n -------------------------------------\n \n On an entirely different vein -- while I knew that GWB's economic ideas were going to turn out the same as they did last time, America can make it through that. We've all had President's that weren't our choice. We've all seen governmental red ink. We grumble and patiently wait for the 4 years to be up and try again. Economics aside, it's the rest of GWB that has us non-conservaties nuts. He has the populace at each other's throats. Unprecidented. The most general thing that I can say is that he's a corner-cutter. He likes work arounds. He's all about loopholes and working the system. Example: Gitmo. Keep them off shore and bypass that constitution. Example: Get a legal definition of prisoner abuse. Bypass the Geneva convention. He lacks true integrity. It's embarrassing.\n \n -------------------------------------\n \n And one more thing. What am I doing wrong. When I try to post, I have to sign in multiple times before it works. This website just keeps kicking me out. It just keeps going back to the user name/password screen. I've learned to copy what I type before I hit \"submit reply\" because it's probably going to be gone.",

   "......\n That's it. He was divorced. Him and what percentage of the population. If there was any real dirt out there on him, we'd know it.\n\n \n You're right, we DO know it. He met with the Vietcong in Paris twice while we were still at war with them. He lied before Congress, admitted to committing war crimes, got 3 questionable Purple Hearts for minor booboos, etc., etc.,\n \n\n So you agree that that is the plan. Bush has a \"spotless\" political record as far as it goes. He's very open about his opinion on everything. Can't find a contradiction. Has had both houses in his camp to help him along. Why would he have to resort to this? His record should appeal to over 50% of the people/states. If his accomplishments are so lofty, this ought to be a landslide for him. If it weren't for 9/11 \"it's the economy stupid\" would work on him, too.\n\n If it wasn't for 9-11, the economy wouldn't have taken a big dive in the first place. We were in a slight recession when 9-11 occurred and it was all downhill from there.\n \n\n Did you see that silly photo-op in LA a couple of weeks ago. They evacuated federal and state high rises as a terrorist drill. As if 5:00 isn't a daily drill. The funniest part was the helicopters. That's their major plan. Helicopter evacuation. 4 people at a time. Sounds like duck and cover.\n\n Didn't see it, but my question is \"why evacuate any Federal Building?\" <:)\n \n\n Gotta keep that terror level up. It polls well. Who's side is he on anyway?\n\n \n And if we didn't have such drills, then liberals would be the first to bitch bout our lack of preparedness. Catch-22 IMO.\n emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Very common among non conservatives. The all encompassing general welfare clause supersedes the entire constitution, and the founders walked away in disgust when the constitution was finished - all in violent disagreement about what it should have said. I wonder if John Kerry thinks this, as he calls the constitution \"precious\"? James Madison claimed that the constitution was the product of many people, but he was called the \"father of the constitution\". He was one of only three men who wrote the federalist papers. Here's what he had to say about the \"general welfare\" clause.\n \n \"With respect to the two words 'general welfare', I have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers connected with them. To take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphsis of the constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by it's creators\". \n \n I assume you consider Madison little more than one of 55 men. Notice he didn't say \"a host of proofs not contemplated by me\", he spoke for all of it's creators. Do you know of any quotes from the other 54 who said he was wrong about that??\n\n \n Here's what Madison thought from his own pen:\n \n\n Madison Wrote in a letter to then Gov of Virginia, Henry Lee \" What think you of the commentary....on the terms 'general welfare'? -- The Federal government has been hitherto limited to the specific powers, by the Greatest Champions of Latitude in expounding those powers --If not only the means, but the objects are unlimited, the parchment had better be thrown into the fire at once\"\n Letter Madison to Henry Lee, Phila. Jan. 1, 1792\n \n and\n \n \"if Congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money, and will promote the general welfare, the government is no longer one possessing enumerated powers, but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions.\"\n Madison to Edmund Pendleton, Jan 21, 1792, Phila.\n \n As for the \"general welfare\" clause itself, Madison pointed out that it had been copied from the Articles of Confederation, \"where it was always understood as nothing more than a general caption to the specified powers, and it is a fact that it was preferred in the new instrument for that very reason as less liable than any other to misconstruction\"\n Ref: Jefferson and Madison- The Great Collaboration by Adrienne Koch p128-9\n \n",
