   "Cross burned at gay man's house \n By ASSOCIATED PRESS \n July 3, 2006 \n \n \n ATHENS, Tenn. - The Meigs County Sheriff's Department is investigating a possible hate crime after someone burned a cross at the home of a gay man. \n The cross, between 6 and 8 feet tall, was discovered by Brandon Waters, along with a derogatory message late Thursday at his home. \n \n \"There are a lot of people that don't approve of it,\" the 23-year-old Waters told The Daily Post-Athenian, referring to being gay. \"They are always bashing us. It makes me fearful of what could happen. I just want to live my life.\" \n \n State fire officials were expected to arrive Monday to assist the sheriff's department in the investigation. \n \n Sheriff Walter Hickman said if the burning is determined to be a hate crime, it could warrant federal charges. \n \n \"Right now we are looking at all angles,\" Hickman said. \"It's a concern because it's a crime.\" \n \n As far as he can recall, Hickman said the incident is the first of its kind in the county's history.\n http://www.knoxnews.com/kns/state/article/0,1406,KNS_348_4819675,00.html",

   "The oral arguments were unusually spirited. There was an unexpected moment when Justice Clarence Thomas broke from his habitual taciturnity on the bench to express his concern that the discussion was \"understating\" the effects of \"a hundred years of lynchings.\"\n \n Thomas described the activities of the Klan as \"a reign of terror\" and the burning cross as \"unlike any other symbol in our society. It was intended to cause fear, terrorize.\"\n \n Thomas' statements dramatized ADL's position -- that the burning cross is not simply a political statement about the views of white supremacists. It is the use of a symbol as a threat. ADL argues in its brief that the government is free to punish that threat. \n \n Justice Scalia asked Rodney A. Smolla, the University of Virginia professor arguing against the statute, the question implicit in ADL's brief: Why he believed that the government could outlaw \"brandishing a weapon and saying 'you're next'\" but not burning a cross. Smolla, who was arguing that outlawing cross burning violated the First Amendment because it was suppressing an unpopular political message, responded that the gun was a weapon. Scalia retorted: \"If you were a Black man you'd rather see a man with a rifle on your lawn than a man with a burning cross.\" \n http://www.adl.org/learn/news/Cross_Burning_Hearing.asp\n \n \n All Americans have a stake in an effective response to violent bigotry. Hate crimes demand a priority response because of their special emotional and psychological impact on the victim and the victim's community. The damage done by hate crimes cannot be measured solely in terms of physical injury or dollars and cents. Hate crimes may effectively intimidate other members of the victim's community, leaving them feeling isolated, vulnerable and unprotected by the law. By making members of minority communities fearful, angry and suspicious of other groups -- and of the power structure that is supposed to protect them -- these incidents can damage the fabric of our society and fragment communities.\n \n ADL has long been in the forefront of national and state efforts to deter and counteract hate-motivated criminal activity. Hate crime statutes are necessary because the failure to recognize and effectively address this unique type of crime could cause an isolated incident to explode into widespread community tension. \n http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/intro.asp",

Violent crime does affect society negatively. That's why I support it being punished. The existence of hate crime legislation does not mean that other crime should go unpunished. It doesn't diminish the effect that other crime has on society.\n \n But the impact on society when a SPECIFIC GROUP is targetted is worse. The alienation and terrorizing of the minority is something that needs to be addressed by society. And it is addressed by society in hate crime legislation.\n \n Sentencing is often a reflection of society's desires for punitive action.\n And poll after poll shows a VAST MAJORITY in American society being in favor of hate crime legislation.\n \n With that in mind, maybe it would behoove you to actually point out why the majority's desire for greater punitive actions in case of hate crimes shouldn't be reflected...\n \n \n \nWhy is this a problem? Why not have hate crimes laws? Does it lessen the concern we have for other crimes? Are we considering assaults and murders (that are not hate crimes) as lesser offenses now?
