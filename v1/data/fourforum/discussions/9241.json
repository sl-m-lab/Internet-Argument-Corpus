This is just ignorant. \n \n I do believe the UN is a farce. It is dominated by nations that think for themseleves. Darfur would not be happening if the UN acted as one for the good of the world. But since China and France and Russia have security council votes, there is no way any of them are going to sacrifice a little for the greater good. The UN should not be a tool the world uses for force. I say, the United States leave the UN and tell them to get the hell out of New York because that is valuable real estate. The United States's expenses to the UN are so ridiculously high compared to anyone elses for SO little and help and in fact more damage than help to anyone. It allows the most unchecked corruption in the entire world. C'mon, the world's greatest powers cannot stop the genocide in Sudan? Sure they could, if they acted as one. But it is not in China's interest to help in Sudan so they are going to block it at the UN which then forces countries to act unilaterally to make a coalition to do something. There are major implications to Iraq here but I won't go into them because there are other threads for that.",

   "I personally agree with some of you. I do not beleive the United Nations is as effective as it was meant to be. I watched CSPAN when all the leaders discussed issues and Ahdmenijad gave his rants, and Chavez gave his. The United Nations was meant to help solve world issues and prevent wars. It was meant for the negotiators as I call them, to come and talk about issues between the two country(s) and try to prevent wars. So far, this does not work so well. They do however provide gread deal of assistance to countries in, i am not sure if turmoil is the right word, but turmoil. \n I beleive it could work, but probably won't. Now, it has many other purposes, but I don't know all of them. \n Hope this helps.\n -Chris",
