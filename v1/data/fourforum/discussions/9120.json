It is frequently convoluted, redundant, meandering and often not all that comprehensible. \n \n I am able to understand even very complex English writing, even translations from ancient texts. I don't think I am an idiot. I think that much of the bible truly is incomprehensible. All the easier for some \"scholar\" to spoon-feed the gullible some invented explanation of god's intentions.",

   "It doesn't exactly make much sense for Jesus to tell his disciples, right there, in the present tense, to suddenly go and bring his enemies before him and slay them (something they were in no position to do in terms of being armed and carrying out such a militaresque mission). Given his use of the present tense, and that such practices were not out of the question with kings and noblemen of the time, it makes a lot more sense to interpret the \"slaying\" command in verse 26 as a comment from the nobleman as part of the parable. (And that's why it's generally accepted that the verse should be interpreted as part of the parable.)\n\n Except that the parable has already ended at verse 26, where Jesus (in his own voice) is very clearly delivering the punch-line. Verse 27 uses the imperative voice, rather than the present tense, so doesn't have to be a 'do-it-now' command: it can as easily be a statement of future intent.\n \n... and there's the fact that there's no indication in the following verses that they began some subsequent kidnapping-and-slaying operation against the enemies of Christ. So it's either that Jesus meant it as part of the parable, or at MOST it was some sort of figurative/symbolic statement--which still invalidates Trebor's use of the passage as an example of Jesus calling for actual violent activities.\n\n I agree that whatever the commandment was meant to convey, it certainly wasn't followed up literally. This doesn't make it any less awkward for the 'Prince of Peace' image.",

Recently, she said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned under any circumstance. The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a east coast resident, which was posted on the Internet. It's funny, as well as informative:\n \n Dear Dr. Laura:\n \n Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to follow them:\n \n When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?\n \n I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?\n \n I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.\n \n Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n \n I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?\n \n A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n \n Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?\n \n Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?\n \n I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?\n \n My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)\n \n I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help.

Or is the Torah the writtings of man and not the word of God?\n\n \n There is debate within Judaism about the last couple chapters of Devarim about whether it was written by Joshua or not. Other then that, I believe that the Torah was revealed letter by letter to Moshe and thousands of Jews at Mt. Sinai and was copied down letter for letter. \n \n Now, before you come back and make accusations that the Torah was miscopied, I thought I would provide you with this:\n \n \nMaintaining the accuracy of any document as ancient and as large as the Torah is very challenging even under the best of circumstances. \n \n But consider that throughout history, Jewish communities were subject to widespread persecutions and exile. Over the last 2,000 years, Jews have been spread to the four corners of the world, from Yemen to Poland, from Australia to Alaska. \n \n Other historical factors make the accurate transmission of the Torah all the more difficult. For example, the destruction of the Temple 1,900 years ago saw the dissolution of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish central authority which traditionally would unify the Jewish people in case of any disagreements.\n \n Let's investigate the facts as we have them today. If we collect the oldest Torah scrolls and compare them, we can see if any garbling exists, and if so, how much.\n \n How many letters are there in the Torah? 304,805 letters (or approximately 79,000 words).\n \n If you were to guess, how many letters of these 304,805 do you think are in question? (Most people guess anywhere from 25 to 1,000 letters.)\n \n The fact is, that after all the trials and tribulations, communal dislocations and persecutions, only the Yemenite Torah scrolls contain any difference from the rest of world Jewry. For hundreds of years, the Yemenite community was not part of the global checking system, and a total of nine letter-differences are found in their scrolls.\n \n These are all spelling differences. In no case do they change the meaning of the word. For example, how would you spell the word \"color?\" In America, it's spelled C-O-L-O-R. But in England, it's spelled with a \"u,\" C-O-L-O-U-R. \n \n Such is the nature of the few spelling differences between Torah scrolls today. The results over thousands of years are remarkable!\n\n \n Link\n \n It also explains many of the regulations when writing a Sefer Torah.",

   "I am not so silly as to take literally everything that the Bible states. The Bible works on various levels. Firstly as a code of laws/conduct; Secondly as an aide in the worship of God; thirdly as a historical record and in many areas an amalgm of all three.\n \n With regards to one and two, this is a matter of faith and for those who believe there is no question with regard to accuracy, it is irrelevant. To those who can't believe, those elements are irrelevant.\n \n Item 3 seems to be the one we are concerned with. I have never said that the Bible is 100% accurate. But I would be ignorant and arrogant indeed if I were to dismiss it as 100% fabrication. Probably on the same level of those who were 100% sure Troy never existed or on the level of the eminent mathematician who proved conclusively that bees can't fly. In other words basically ignorant and unwilling to delve in and find truths.\n \n Folklore and racial memory are dismissed at your peril. The more intersting part is to delve in and try and discover the kernel of truth behind the spin. I would love to be back in a few thousand years and see what historians make of our writing etc now. Braveheart was mentioned as fiction. Indeed as a story it was. However, there is the kernel of truth behind it namely the war between England and Scotland and the existence of William Wallace. Take the film of the discovery of the Enigma machine now attributed to the US Navy. Would that become solemn fact 2000 years later ? Probably if that remains the only evidence.\n \n I have never said 'because the Bible said it it must be true'. What clearly happened is that the Bible was written many centuries after the events to the best of peoples' ability. The BIble can reasonably be supposed to be providing some EVIDENCE of an event. One may speculate that it didn't necessarily happen as it did. The destruction of the Egyptian army in the Red sea to take an example. There was probably a small squadron chasing after a smallish group of fleeing Israelites which fell into the REED sea. When the fleeing group met up with their friends the old spin took place 'Gosh we were being chased by the whole Egyptian Army'. Sounds much better.\n \n Poor Scolarship it is indeed and total arrogance to be so dismissive without any contrary evidence.",
