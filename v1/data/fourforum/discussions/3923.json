   "For more than a decade, Patricia Ireland has been one of radical feminism&#8217;s most vocal leaders. From 1991-2001 she led the National Organization for Women (NOW). In addition to her well-known struggle for the &#8220;right&#8221; of women to extinguish the lives of their unborn children, Ireland has been a vigilant defender of various issues pertaining to the homosexual agenda. As a lawyer, she has been a moving force in promoting lesbian, bisexual, and transgender issues.\n \n What has not been publicized is her apparent claim of being an expert on the Bible and Jesus.\n \n In a television interview while attempting to justify the &#8220;pro-gay&#8221; doctrine of the Democratic Party, she boasted that she was raised a &#8220;Christian,&#8221; and that she knows the Bible quite well. Her parting shot, as the interview concluded, was to this effect. &#8220;Jesus never said anything about homosexuality.&#8221;\n \n This is a commonly repeated statement, and I've read this anywhere from the Washington Post to countless numbers of forums.\n \n What is the truth about Homosexuality and the Bible?",

   "In a television interview while attempting to justify the \"pro-gay\" doctrine of the Democratic Party, she (Patricia Ireland) boasted that she was raised a \"Christian,\" and that she knows the Bible quite well. Her parting shot, as the interview concluded, was to this effect. \"Jesus never said anything about homosexuality.\"\n\n \n If Patricia Ireland was raised a \"Christian\", then she should know that Jesus is God incarnate (John 1, John 8:58, Titus 2:13, etc.). Therefore Jesus, as God, is already on record as having commanded against gay sexual relations (Leviticus 18:22, Leviticus 20:13, etc.). She should also know that all Scripture is inspired by God (2 Timothy 3:16). Therefore there are also New Testament admonitions against gay sex (note Romans 1:26-27). \n \n Patricia Ireland obviously doesn't know what she's talking about.",

   "I've never heard a good response to the following question:Why can we apparently pick and choose which admonitions recorded in Leviticus actually still apply today and which ones don't?\n\n \n The \"Law\" consists of a moral code, civil laws, tort laws, dietary laws, and ceremonial laws. The moral law of God transcends the Old Covenant to the New Covenant / Testament. For instance, Jesus spoke out against adultery. Now that's an Old Covenant law yet it is reiterated in the New Testament. Same with murder and stealing. So we see a consistency with the moral law that we don't find with the ceremonial law, etc. In Revelation chapter two, verses 20-22 Jesus speaks out against sexual immorality, so that too is another example.",
