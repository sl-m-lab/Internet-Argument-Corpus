   "\"If you cant get it through the front door sneak it through the back\"....an analogy that fits this administration well. Their total disregard to individuals rights and their lack of understanding to what the working class needs will never change. The extension the administration received recently will only give them time to try and get a renewed patriot act 2 through. Every american needs to be very scared if this passes. I am still not sure how any american can have confidence in a president that has admitted to spying on individuals withouth going through proper channels, and now he has spit on the constitution calling it \"just a piece of paper\".....excuse me but wasnt it this piece of paper he claims to hold so dearly and its laws and theory held so dear to his values and his ideology. Seems like he needs to learn what those words mean....anyone have a dictionary they can give to him?????\n \n \n \n Here are 5 reasons to be afraid of the Patriot Act;\n \n 1. It knocks the stuffing out of the Fourth Amendment, which mandates the maximum respect for the sanctity of a citizen's home and personal property. It establishes that the rights of the individual are equal to the power of the government. Isn't individualism a foundation block of conservative thinking?\n \n 2. It allows secret searches of homes and offices without timely notification to their occupants and permits the secret seizure of private property. These are police state tactics.\n \n 3. It permits the government to employ secret courts to collect data on the private lives of its citizens, ranging from library check-outs to gun purchases, without the judicial checks and balances.\n \n 4. It defines terrorist activity so broadly it could be applied against all manner of political dissenters, including pro-life demonstrators.\n \n 5. Finally -- and this is my favorite -- the power of the Patriot Act doesn't expire with the current administration.\n \n \n \n The great leader has made another boo-boo....on Dec 10th Bush said;\n \n \"I don't give a ######n,\" Bush retorted. \"I'm the President and the Commander-in-Chief. Do it my way.\"\n \n \"Mr. President,\" one aide in the meeting said. \"There is a valid case that the provisions in this law undermine the Constitution.\"\n \n \"Stop throwing the Constitution in my face,\" Bush screamed back. \"It's just a ######ned piece of paper!\"\n \n \n Read the article;\n http://forum.truthout.org/blog/story/2005/12/10/81959/968",

After the world has been alerted to how 9/11 and other attacks were conceived and executed? Conventional thinking based on past experience has ruined more businesses, generals and intelligence agencies than any other single factor and from your comment you're still relying on 'surprising' the enemy. Better start spying on your neighbors for 'points'; that's the next step in a police state when LE and intelligence are unlimited in operational scope.",
