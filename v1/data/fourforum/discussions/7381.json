   "From an excellent article by John Dean that attempts to define \"judicial activism\": \nAfter reviewing usage of the term in judicial opinions, law journal articles, and the general news media, Kmiec found that the phrase \"judicial activism\" has at least \"five core meanings:\n \n The charge has been lodged when, according to the speaker, the court at issued has (1) invalidated an arguably constitutional action by another branch; (2) failed to adhere to precedent; (3) legislated from the bench; (4) departed from accepted interpretive mythology; or (5) engaged in result-oriented judging.\n \n * * *\n \n Let's focus, for a moment, on the second category: Failure to adhere to precedent. It's key, to understand this charge, to know the difference between vertical precedent (from a higher court) or horizontal precedent (from the court itself, or a court of the same level). Ignoring a vertical precedent - for instance, a federal district court's opting to ignore binding U.S. Supreme Court precedent -- can be judicial activism. But ignoring horizontal precedent - while it may be controversial - is not judicial activism. \n \n So when the Supreme Court overturns its own precedent, or when a federal appellate court differs from all the other federal appeals courts that have considered the question (but the Supreme Court has not yet ruled), these actions may be controversial, but should not be labeled activism. A difference of opinion or considered change of mind as to how the law ought to be read, is not activism. \n \n Another important distinction within this category is what kind of precedent is at issue: constitutional, statutory, or \"common law.\" (The common law is the law made, over our history, by judges). Overturning a constitutional or common law precedent is not considered judicial activism. \n http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dean/20050617.html",

   "His position does not stand up to scrutiny because the law treats both genders equally. \n No they don't. Race is the one that is hard to overcome. Otherwise the law doesn't say you can't have different laws for gender or age etc. 10 yrs not being able to marry is the best example of this.\n \n \n\n Actually it could have. The justices just went several steps further and made ALL sodomy laws unconstitutional, not just the ones that were specific to homosexual sodomy.\n Not true, only O'Connor felt Equal protection applied here. Kennedy actually rejected the Equal Protections argument n Lawrence Vs. Texas. Scalias dissent actually talks about this.\n \n \n Finally, I turn to petitioners' equal-protection challenge, which no Member of the Court save Justice O'Connor, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), embraces: On its face \u00a721.06(a) applies equally to all persons. Men and women, heterosexuals and homosexuals, are all subject to its prohibition of deviate sexual intercourse with someone of the same sex. To be sure, \u00a721.06 does distinguish between the sexes insofar as concerns the partner with whom the sexual acts are performed: men can violate the law only with other men, and women only with other women. But this cannot itself be a denial of equal protection, since it is precisely the same distinction regarding partner that is drawn in state laws prohibiting marriage with someone of the same sex while permitting marriage with someone of the opposite sex.\n \n The objection is made, however, that the antimiscegenation laws invalidated in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 8 (1967), similarly were applicable to whites and blacks alike, and only distinguished between the races insofar as the partner was concerned. In Loving, however, we correctly applied heightened scrutiny, rather than the usual rational-basis review, because the Virginia statute was \"designed to maintain White Supremacy.\" Id., at 6, 11. A racially discriminatory purpose is always sufficient to subject a law to strict scrutiny, even a facially neutral law that makes no mention of race\n\n \n \nPeople do get to decide change. Indivduals brought challenges to those laws that were eventually deemed unconstitutional.\n Loving correctly so (see above) other laws...not so much. A bad law doesn't get to be unconstitutional because it is bad. Abortion, homosexual sodomy, assisted suicide, etc are not protected by the constitution but can be changed by a simple law.",
