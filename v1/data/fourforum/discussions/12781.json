   "I hope I say this well, but just so I am clear. Is the desire to be able to have the same rights as a heterosexual couple including being marrided by a priest in a church or would being able to wed legally with all the rights but a church could still refuse to perform the ceremony because of it's beleifs. So if the ceremony is desired it just couldn't happen in a church that wasn't willing, but once done all the rights are granted.\n \n Personally I think the church has a right to it's beliefs, I think they are wrong, but they are allowed to be. I don't agree that they fell it is necessary to shove their belief down everyone else throat. So thinking a church is like a club membership and to be a member you have to abide by certain rules. But that is where it stops and there rules are voluntary for members and not mandatory for non-members. So for me Homosexuals should have all the rights and obligations for being married, but if a church doesn't want to perform the ceremony they should not be required to.\n \n It's not dicrimination in my eyes. A very fine line I would agree, but hasn't crossed it. There is nothing biblical saying blacks, or hispanics or asians or handicapped people are forbidden to be married ( I know the bible doesn't say homosexuals either, but they don't seem to understand that so humor me for arguments sake)\n \n So what say you. Am I close, go take a flying leap, right on the money, I hate you and hope elbows fall off......",

The movement for equal marriage rights is NOT a movement to try to force churches to marry same-sex couples. It's a movement for equal civil marriage rights, meaning the right to marry one's spouse legally. Churches can marry whomever they wish and refuse to marry whomever they wish, and that's up to them. Those of us who are working for marriage equality want the states to grant our marriages legal status and the federal government to extend federal rights and benefits to our marriages.",

   "Good point, Jo.\n \n And I know I've made this point before, but....\n \n Currently two people OF THE OPPOSITE SEX can go to a justice of the peace, and openly and loudly declare they are: homosexual, not in love, plan to commit adultery and not procreate, are atheistic, have AIDS, act in porn films, are convicted thieves, and covet their neighbor's belongings....and get legally married in any state in this country within the twinkling of an eye.\n \n And the most right-wing moralist, on hearing of this, will yawn, let alone protest. Hey, they're of the opposite sex aren't they? \n \n But should two peop/e of THE SAME SEX go to that same justice of the peace and declare that though they too are homosexual, they are: deeply in love and devoted to each other, disease-free, believe in God, have no criminal records, and intend to adopt a child abandoned by its straight parents...well, sorry, bud, but in 45 states you're out of luck.\n \n And if they persist in trying to in one of those states, those same right-wing moralists will post a flood of anti-gay messages on the internet, start raising money to promote legislation that will prevent them (even though they don't live in their state) EVER being legally married (or even \"unionized\") and raise a major stink about how immoral they are, and will bring about the end of civilisation as we know it.\n \n Hey, they're the same sex, aren't they?",

I want to be able to walk into my government's office come out with a piece of paper that is called the same thing as heteros get.

This post and another I saw (Although it was with Archangel, so maybe only this one counts) you seem a wee bit on the angry side. I won't pretend to understand what life is like in your shoes, but from my own experience and of course easier said than done, but after the what or whoever has gotten you to this point they walk away and forget about it while you walk away not letting it go. Think of it like having a puppy you get mad and frustrated when it does things like pee on your couch or chews on your dress shoes, but you realize it's a puppy and it doesn't know any better. It takes time but you train it to behave and it may slip up evey so often but eventually it learns. So to tie this all together carrying it with you doesn't do you any good and anti gay people are just big, dumb, ugly versions of puppies. They just need to be trained in being human. \n \n As with all advise the option of using some of it all of it or none of it is completly yours.\n \n And I will shut up and go away now",
