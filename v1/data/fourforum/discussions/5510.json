   "This is the same team working at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, MT that reportedd the soft tissue remnants from a T. rex recently. This may be the same specimen since they had to cut the femur to move it and this allowed access to the interior.\n \n The Museum of the Rockies is associated with Montana State University, where Jack Horner also teaches. Mary Schweitzer and Jennifer Wittmeyer are from the University of North Carolina where Dr. Schweitzer teaches, although she earned her PhD at Montana State U.\n \n This is another piece of evidence that birds are descended from the theropod dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis indicates that the tyrannosauroids and the maniraptoriformes separated from a common ancestral lineage.",
