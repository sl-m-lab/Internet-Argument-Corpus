   "The debate about homosexual marriage may actually bring about what the doomsayers fear. Namely, abolishing marriage entirely.\n \n There is a proposed New Hampshire bill that removes marriage entirely from the statute books and replaces it with Domestic Unions.\n \n Here's a perspective on the New Hampsire bill.\n \n If the government no longer marries people, it cannot control who can and can&#8217;t get married, so the argument about gay marriage becomes irrelevant&#8211;the legal rights and protections of &#8220;marriage&#8221; are no longer at stake. Domestic partnership may still have conditions and qualifications, but the &#8220;sacred institution of marriage&#8221; loses its legal definition and with that the legal requirements necessary to enter it. Whether or not that&#8217;s a good thing is up for discussion.\n \n In referencing the Prop 8 decision there have been more calls to simply abolish marriage (including articles in Forbes and Slate magazines). \n \n For the rest of us who otherwise value the role of government in our lives, benefits and rights can as easily be based on family functions, not forms. If I am my best friend&#8217;s primary caregiver, then I should be able to sign up to be one of, say, three people who have hospital visitation rights. If I want my closest aunt to be my Social Security beneficiary, why should the government stop me from signing her up? If I can use my cell phone to vote for American Idol, I&#8217;m sure I can press a few keys and designate my next of kin.\n \n Even Cass Sunstein, Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, advises:\n \n \"Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government,\" wrote Sunstein [...] Sunstein explains his approach would ensure that \"the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic-partnership agreement between any two people.\"\n \n While I'm sure this will be hailed as a victory for homosexual advocates, I cannot help but feel a little aghast at this. Does anyone else have a perspective on this? Is it time to abolish marriage as a legal custom?",

   "\n \n While I'm sure this will be hailed as a victory for homosexual advocates, I cannot help but feel a little aghast at this. Does anyone else have a perspective on this? Is it time to abolish marriage as a legal custom?\n\n \n First we prefer the term \"gay'. Secondly, in case your ignorant on the subject matter here is the issue. One is that the Federal government still as of now enforces DOMA. With DOMA in place, even if every single state recognized gays marrying it wouldn't mean anything to Federally mandated rights for married couples.\n \n Secondly, there are over 1200 rights as defined by the word \"marriage\" alone from the State level and nearly as many that are further defined on the Federal level.\n \n So even if gays get married on the state level they are barred from the Federal rights of straights. And if they get a domestic partnership they are barred from both state and federal rights as defined by the word \"marriage.\"\n \n It either comes down to three things. The proposal put above. or change every single law to have it state marriage and other partnerships hence civil unions, domestic partnerships, etc.\n \n Or to finally get rid of DOMA and achieve marriage equality in all 50 states. That's basically the only way for gays to achieve full equality under the law in their relationships.",

One is perjorative, the other is neutral.\n \n DOMA is meaningless in regards to States deciding whether to recognize homosexual unions. The point of the post is that as a result of the contention between the issue the solution by homosexual advocates seems to be that 'marriage' carries too many connotations and therefore cannot be supported by the government. Given the meaning the custom has had to us, to simply do away with it seems a brutal and heavy-handed approach.",

This is when the Churches decided to take over the Customs and decide for themselves what Laws to attach to Marriage.

They are indeed separate.\n \n \n The point of the post was about the word marriage, not the benefits given.\n If it were simply this then why would gays even care about the word marriage?

Will you try to link anything to try to make your case seem valid? So then what about infertile straight couples? I suppose they shouldn't marry then as well correct?\n \n The meaning of marriage is two loving people coming together under the law to have their love bound to one another and recognized by the law. Nowhere does it state that those married need to pop a kid out... So please stop grasping at straws. We already have an overpopulation problem as it is.\n \n \n \n \nIt has cultural meaning to us as a traditional and historical custom. \n\n \n US? PLEASE stop saying us. Us is YOU.
