God through his preist governs the land and the disrubution of goods.\n\n \n I don't mean to be pedantic. I believe that the most perfectable government for Christians would be theocracy.\n \n As a Christian I understand that any government formed by man can never be perfect. Therefore even a theocracy is liable to have imperfection.\n \n I do believe such a system is preferrable.\n \n However at the end of the day; and this is why I'm not on protests all the time; the task for a Christian is to be closer to Christ. Some of this involves prayer and separation from the world.\n \n This is why I think Christianity and Communism will always be divergent - their goals are too far apart.",
