   "I wanted to start a separate thread on this because I'm truly curious and did not want it lost in another thread. If it's been covered before somewhere else, my apologies.\n \n I heard that Terri Schiavo originally had a heart attack at the age of 26 because of low potassium as the result of an \"eating-disorder\" (which may or may not be true). My understanding is that she went from over 200 pounds to 110 or 120, by anyone's standards a pretty healthy weight for a woman (granted, I don't know over what time period she lost this weight). My question is this, if a young, healthy woman can have a heart attack at 26 because of \"low potassium\", then why didn't that same woman, at 41 die of a heart attack instead of starvation and dehydration (and PLEASE, I don't want some kinda spin that EVERYONE dies of a heart attack in the sense that it was her heart stopping that killed her, I think we know what I mean here). I mean, she had NO nutrition or water for 13 days, I would think her potassium would plummet to nothing during that time. I know peoples bodies are different, but anorexics who weigh much less than Terri did at the time she had the \"heart attack\" still survive, even though THEY surely must have very low potassium. And, I could be mistaken, I'm definitely not a doctor (unlike some on here who like to think they are), but when one has a heart attack, isn't there also damage to the heart? Luckily I don't know anybody that's had one, so I'm just asking real simple questions that require no Liberal/Conservative slant",

Luckily I don't know anybody that's had one, so I'm just asking real simple questions that require no Liberal/Conservative slant\n\n \n Actually, a good question that I am sure many people have, but were unable to state so clearly. \n \n First and foremost, Terri did not have a heart attack at age 26. A heart attack (myocardial infarction, literally meaning death of heart muscle) is brought about by a blockage of blood flow to a coronary artery whether by build up of plaque, a clot, or spasm of the artery. A true \"heart attack\" results in damage to the heart muscle, due to the lack of blood flow and subsequent lack of oxygen. This is much like what happened to Terri's brain when she collapsed so many years ago. \n \n Terri suffered a cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest is when the heart stops beating, and can be brought about by a variety of causes. Chemical imbalance (such as sodium, calcium, or potassium), electrical disturbance, heart attacks, or even trauma can all cause cardiac arrest. In Terri's case, it is believed that she had a dangerously low potassium, as you pointed out. \n \n You hit on a good point too, that it is unknown how fast Terri lost her weight, or what her dietary habits (including purging by vomiting, laxatives, or excessive hydration) really were. Just because Terri was 26 and weight appropriate does not indicate that she was healthy. Bulemia is a dangerous and potentially deadly disease, and if Terri truely was bulemic, it is highly likely that this led to her cardiac arrest.\n \n As you may or may not know, the heart relies upon sodium, potassium, calcium, and several other elements to function. Potassium in the heart is vital to the operation of the sodium-potassium pump, which provides for electrical depolarization and repolarization of the heart. This is what is responsible for the electrical signals that stimulate the contraction and relaxation of the cardiac muscle. ANY disturbance in the balance of these elements (either too little or too much) can cause an electrical malfunction, and potentiate a lethal dysrhythmia (unorganized or abnormal heart rhythm). It is actually an overdose of potassium that is used to stop the heart in lethal injection cases.\n \n It is likely that as Terri died in the hospice a few days ago, that she died due to a chemical imbalance, which ultimately stopped her heart. (I know you said you did not want to hear someone say that her heart stopping killed her, but I must in all honesty say: It was her heart stopping that killed her). Terri was maintained by the feeding tube, which provided adequate nutrition to keep her alive. This type of nutrition is balanced to provide the right amount of elements and nutrients to maintain normal body chemistry. Once the feeding tube was removed from Terri, she began to become chemically imbalanced due to the lack of nutrition. The lack of water caused her kidneys to shut down, which in turn led to a change in the chemical balance in Terri's body. Ultimately, this chemical imbalance would lead to a dsyrhythmia that would stop her heart. \n \n You said about her level of potassium \"plummeting\" without food and water. Actually, levels would change slowly, keep in mind that her electrolytes were probably in balance prior to removal of the feeding tube. The levels would change more rapidly after her kidneys failed, but this still takes somewhere from 7-10 days on average to occur. And also, keep in mind that Terri was inactive, which would allow her to sustain her electrolyte levels easier than you or I. \n \n You also mention anorexic people. First, Terri was thought to be bulemic, which is a different disorder. Second, it is very possible for the human body to create a tolerance of an electrolyte imbalance over an extended period of time. Alcoholics are a good example of this. Although not healthy, many people can survive with significant electrolyte imbalances. \n \n So basically, Terri died of a cardiac arrest which was caused by an electrolyte imbalance. Yes, you can say that Terri dehydrated to death, but it is the electrolyte imbalance caused by the dehyfration that actually stopped Terri's heart. \n \n And strangely, you do not have to be a doctor to understand anatomy and physiology. ;)",

   "Snake,\n I appreciate the information, it does shed some light. I understand the difference bewtween bulemia and anorexia, but I'm still curious though...you say that one can develop a tolerance for these imbalances. How does an anorexic, who basically gets little, to no, nutrition develop this tolerance to be able to survive for as long as they do then? And a bulemic, who can be \"overweight\" and not appear to be suffering from any eating disorder, getting nutrition at least periodically, then suffer cardiac arrest? Wouldn't their bodies become tolerant of nutrition for a period, then no nutrition for a period, in the same way that anorexics would become tolerant of no nutrition, and then therefore be able to handle the chemical imbalances?",

But usually, to \"enjoy\" something one has to be concious and aware. Brain scans showed that Teri's brain activity was limited to the brain stem, sometimes called the \"reptile brain\" It controls sleep cycles, breathing and some other autonomic functions. A person with only brain stem activity could make noises - squeals, groans, and even laughter. The brain stem isn't involved in pain, pleasure, thought or awareness, much less \"enjoyment.\" In Teri's case, her brain showed massive atrophy and shrinkage in 2002 brain scans. There didn't appear to be any signs of regeneration.\n \nShe was loved by her God fearing parents and many others.\n\n Probably true but not relevant.\n \nShe was a burden to her husband and was killed by him and several liberal judges.\n\n Actually, her husband kept her alive for many years.

There was quite a bit of evidence presented. It was not JUST the word of her husband, far from it. From the appelate court decision re: the case:\n \n \nWe note that the guardianship court's original order expressly relied upon and found credible the testimony of witnesses other than Mr. Schiavo or the Schindlers. We recognize that Mrs. Schiavo's earlier oral statements were important evidence when deciding whether she would choose in February 2000 to withdraw life-prolonging procedures. See \u00a7 765.401(3), Fla. Stat. (2000); In re Guardianship of Browning, 568 So. 2d 4, 16. Nevertheless, the trial judge, acting as her proxy, also properly considered evidence of Mrs. Schiavo's values, personality, and her own decision-making process.\n\n \n \n \n \nAssuming she DID say it...how many of us have far exceeded the age of 26 and look back and thought how stupid we were for saying or thinking stupid thoughts. Other than SOME here, our thoughts change as we mature. We have all, to one degree or another, as teenagers or young adults, made similar comments when referring to reaching a certain age or become the vicitm of some debilitating disease or accident, only to change our minds when we reach that age or fall victim to that debilitating disease. \n \n \n So you are effectively arguing that since you might change your mind later, you should not be allowed to make decisions when you are young? Luckily, this does not apply here, since terri had no mind later. \n \n \n None of us would CHOOSE to live like Terri did, but absent CLEAR and updated directives, or at the very least a guardian WITHOUT benefiting from your death, society should be cautious and preserve the life. So, you people that believe the husband and have all the facts, where is the ABSOLUTE, CLEAR and CONVINCING proof that she wanted this...lacking anything other than HIS word, she should not have been starved to death\n\n \n Where is the clear and convicning evidence? It was presented at trial. Not only did greer rule that there was clear and convincing evidence, his decision to that effect was backed by more than one appelate court. \n \n \"Clear and convincing\" is the highest level of proof in a civil suit. It essentially means that there is absolutly no doubt and no room for debate. \n \n Again from the appellate court:\n \n \n[T]he Schindlers argue that the testimony, which was conflicting, was insufficient to support the trial court's decision by clear and convincing evidence. We have reviewed that testimony and conclude that the trial court had sufficient evidence to make this decision. The clear and convincing standard of proof, while very high, permits a decision in the face of inconsistent or conflicting evidence. See In re Guardianship of Browning, 543 So. 2d at 273.\n \n The testimony in this case establishes that Theresa was very young and very healthy when this tragedy struck. Like many young people without children, she had not prepared a will, much less a living will. She had been raised in the Catholic faith, but did not regularly attend mass or have a religious advisor who could assist the court in weighing her religious attitudes about life-support methods. Her statements to her friends and family about the dying process were few and they were oral. Nevertheless, those statements, along with other evidence about Theresa, gave the trial court a sufficient basis to make this decision for her.\n \n In the final analysis, the difficult question that faced the trial court was whether Theresa Marie Schindler Schiavo, not after a few weeks in a coma, but after ten years in a persistent vegetative state that has robbed her of most of her cerebrum and all but the most instinctive of neurological functions, with no hope of a medical cure but with sufficient money and strength of body to live indefinitely, would choose to continue the constant nursing care and the supporting tubes in hopes that a miracle would somehow recreate her missing brain tissue, or whether she would wish to permit a natural death process to take its course and for her family members and loved ones to be free to continue their lives. After due consideration, we conclude that the trial judge had clear and convincing evidence to answer this question as he did. \n\n \n \n Now, a question for you. Why do you feel qualified to second guess all the judges, doctors, her friends and husband, etc... When you are obviously ignorant of even the most basic facts of the case? You do not seem to be even marginally conversant with even the public information available, much less any of the thousands of hours of testimony that are not acessible as part of the public record. Why do you feel compelled to get out and spread around the disinformation you have picked up? How do you even feel qualified to form an opinion, much less share it, without being in posession of the facts?",

If it's one person's word against another's (which is basically what this case boils down to) then you err on the side of caution\n\n \n I don't know, nor do you. I posted the relevant portions of the apellant courts decision, which clearly states that they felt that the burden of \"clear and convincing\" evidence had been met. when they took it to the styste supreme court, they found the same thing. \n \n I am guessing that, since the appelate court points out that thee were multiple witnesses besides her husband, it si true and your understanding is absed on the non informed, ignorant ramblings of othe people who have gottten their information in spoon sized bited from conjectural sources. As far as \"erring on the side of caustion\"....Flordia courts are required to \"err on the side of life\", and the appelate court ruled that Greer did. HEre is the relevant portion of their ruling:\n \n \n[T]he Schindlers argue that the testimony, which was conflicting, was insufficient to support the trial court's decision by clear and convincing evidence. We have reviewed that testimony and conclude that the trial court had sufficient evidence to make this decision. The clear and convincing standard of proof, while very high, permits a decision in the face of inconsistent or conflicting evidence. See In re Guardianship of Browning, 543 So. 2d at 273.\n \n In Browning, we stated:\n \n \n In making this difficult decision, a surrogate decisionmaker should err on the side of life... In cases of doubt, we must assume that a patient would choose to defend life in exercising his or her right of privacy.\n In re Guardianship of Browning, 543 So.2d at 273. We reconfirm today that a court's default position must favor life.\n \n The testimony in this case establishes that Theresa was very young and very healthy when this tragedy struck. Like many young people without children, she had not prepared a will, much less a living will. She had been raised in the Catholic faith, but did not regularly attend mass or have a religious advisor who could assist the court in weighing her religious attitudes about life-support methods. Her statements to her friends and family about the dying process were few and they were oral. Nevertheless, those statements, along with other evidence about Theresa, gave the trial court a sufficient basis to make this decision for her.\n\n \n Is that somehow not clear to you?\n \n \n \nShe made no \"decision\" when she was young, she made a COMMENT...big difference. \n \n \n The decision of the courts were based on more than \"a comment\", as I have clearly shown.\n \n \n \n \nC'mon, you're smarter than this...just because the decision happened to jive with your belief, DOESN'T mean that there is no room for argument or debate. As I said above, whether or not you agree doesn't matter, other individual judges were IN the room and I'm sure had much more information than even YOU, and they DID find room for debate\n\n \n Ancd yet ALL the courts that this went through came to the same conclusion. What is this about \"other judges in the same room\"? Whee were those \"other judges\" who apparently disagreed (though I find it highly unlikely that any other judge took any interest in this until later in the case) during the YEARS that it was being appealed?\n \n Every time the question was approached over whether the \"clear and convincing\" standard of evidence had been met, it was ruled that it HAS (I believe that it was under scrutiny 7 times). \n \n \n \nI make absolutely NO claims to know better than anyone, unlike YOU. There are some people opn here who are high on themselves, but none are more full of themselves (OR it) than you. Your arrogance never ceases to amaze me...my God, if you truly no all as you seem to THINK you do, what in the HELL are you doing on HERE?

Wait, I can answer that FOR you and save us all the agony of your response...it's obvious that THEY just don't possess the keen analytical skills as you...am I CLOSE? or dead on?\n\n \n WHAT JUDGES WERE DISSENTING based on the question of the \"clear and convincing evidence\" question? The dissenting judges in the subsequent appeals NEVER questioned whether the burden of \"cklear and convincing\" had been met. One judge (of the nearly 20 who looked at this directly) dissented because they felt that if there was another individual willing to assume gaurdinship that they should be allowed, regardless of what the court had previously ruled. The other judge who actually dissented felt that a guardian ad litem should have been appointed. In proceedings such as this, the COURT becomes essentially the guardian ad litem, so that would have been frivolous anyway. \n \n Arrogance? By suggestiong that since you do not posess even the most basic facts of the case that maybe you should not be spewing your uninformed opinion around the net? I merely pointed that out iun an attempt to save you some embaressment. It is better to keep your mouth shut and be assumed a fool than to open it and remove all doubt, right?",
