You really want to go there? \n\n \n No, I would never want to go there and watch you parrot still more liberal talking points in defense of Clinton. \n \n \nBy that measure, TR was a flaming liberal. \n\n \n More liberal talking points to defend Clinton. It's a different world than it was 100 years ago. Did TR ever go against the wishes of every congressman and the governor of a state? \n \n \nInteresting how he could do that given that he cannot write laws and that the GOP controlled both houses. Explain. Oh wait. \n\n \n Haven't been keeping up with the Fannie mae/Freddie mac thing to closely, have you? Many liberals haven't. \n \n \nDefine waste. Your stances on the environment would mean it would be okay for people to live in Superfund sites. \n\n \n Waste; millions of dollars of auto emissions testing that never was proven to do any good, with no proof that any \"good\" was necessary. \n \n \nLook at the debt under Clinton. Need I say more?\n\n \n Nah. You've got all the liberal talking points in defense of Clinton very well covered.",

It's those things that contributed to the US being almost 10 trillion in debt.\n\n \n NONSENSE!!\n \n The deficit can be laid at the feet of RAYgun, Bush I, and (especially) Bush II.\n \n I know that your mind is made up, not to be confused with facts, but it's a terrible thing to see it displayed so prominently.\n \n Before you say they had to deal with a Democratic Congress, remember they kept their veto pen closed, unlike President Clinton who stood up to Salamander Gingrich and the rest of the hard right religious radical lunatic fringe.",

   "Is Marc ever right on anything these days?\n \n Presidents and the Federal Debt\n \n United Stated National Debt\n\n \n \n Well, come on now, you've got to give me credit for some things anyway, like a week or so ago when I linked you to the description of a troll - you fit that description so well! When you call liberals conservatives and conservatives liberals, it takes us to this paragraph in that link;\n \n \nWhile sometimes, he may sound like a stupid, uninformed, ignorant poster, do not be deceived! Most trolls are highly intelligent people trying to hide behind a mask of stupidity and/or ignorance! They usually have an agenda. \n\n \n Highly intelligent is quite a stretch in your case of course, but even low to moderate intelligence can try to make himself look stupid, and make it a resounding success!! When you said \"How are the first and last the same as legislating what you can't do in your own bed room between consenting adults?\" - as if legislation for gay rights and legalizing prostitution are conservative issues, you took trying to look stupid, uninformed and ignorant to new heights! \n \n To carry on a political dialog in the US, as is done all the time in the media - newpapers, news television like CNN and Fox, or even message boards like this, there are accepted standards on what liberal and conservative means. A quick search turns up this distinction between the two:\n \n Conservative vs. Liberal Beliefs\n \n This is common knowledge in top level political discussion. You don't see Alan Colmes or Bob Beckel or George Stephanopoulos accusing Ann Coulter or Karl Rove as being liberals, do you? They'd get laughed off the air if they did. Isn't it just a little bit of a strange feeling to accuse Bassman, Isly, Archangel, Ethmi, or myself of being liberals? Just a little bit? Or calling Bill Clinton a conservative? Doesn't it require just a little effort, or cause just a slight pause, to do something so obviously laughable? \n \n You interject the word \"fiscal\" a lot - as the above link shows, conservatism isn't only about spending - spending is actually only a small part of it. Liberals seldom want to spend money on national defense, but that doesn't mean they're conservative on that issue. In that case, spending IS conservative (national defense, and most all military action that goes with it) and not spending IS liberal. There are other examples of this as well. Your line; \" T.Q is more fiscally conservative then you are\" shows your desperation to narrow the definition of conservative to fiscal matters only. There is much more to it than that. \n \n You would do much better in your pretend conservative game if you would at least sometimes comment on the liberalism of Obama, or most other big names in the Democrat party, or those liberals on this board, rather than ignore them or agree with them as you always do. \n \n \nNo it does not. By your logic, if I had two sheets of colored paper, red and orange, you'd say that the orange one was blue because the red one less blue. What kind of asinine reasoning is that? \n\n \n Your asininity in pulling the color blue out of thin air. Conservative vs liberal (red vs orange) are the ONLY games in town. If you're watching the election returns tonight, you'll see only two positions being reported. \n \n \nLol. You really think that the GOP is actually for free markets? More like selectively for free markets. One of the biggest detractors of the Dubai World port deal was Republicans. And Bush enacted all sorts of protectionist ####. \n\n \n They are far, far more for free markets than are liberal Democrats. \n \n \nOnly you would consider reducing our liabilities to be a bad thing. \n\n \n No, many many actual conservatives question liberal claims that he reduced our liabilities at all. Liberal Democrat talking points aren't always facts, as you seem to believe. \n \n \nApparently Reagan mortgaging the future is okay, but Clinton paying down the debt is not okay. Whackjob in the house. \n\n \n Again, only liberals believe that Reagan actually \"mortgaged the future\", or that Clinton actually \"paid down the debt\". Liberal in the house. \n \n \nGood luck proving every Congressman and Governor was against it. \n\n \n Good luck proving any president has the power to mortgage the future, or pay down the debt. \n \n \nTypical. You blame Clinton for things that required Congressional legislation yet you defend Bush for things that Congress did. How hypocritical. \n \n How did the Executive branch change laws that can only be changed by the Legislative branch?\n \n Or have you forgotten how our government works? \n\n \n I wouldn't be able to depend on you for lessons, since you believe Reagan mortgaged anything, or that Clinton paid down anything. \n \n \nDefine any good. Again, your environmental stance would make it okay to dump raw sewage into our drinking water supply. Define your criteria. \n\n \n Raw sewage? Drinking water? You build environmental straw men like only a liberal can. \n \n \nThanks for admitting you aren't for reducing our liabilities. Remind me again, why it is okay to leverage out our future and pass the buck to our kids? \n\n \n Ask tax and spend Democrats. Our future has been leveraged out domestically far more than it has militarily.",
