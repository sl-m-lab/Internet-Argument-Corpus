   "Sounds like a flower job to me, maybe a 'TULIP? Never did like Calvinism.\nTULIP it is, from the Synod of Dort (1618-19).\n \nThi(s) i(s) the same nonsense that was peddled by John Calvin is his Institutes of the Christian Religion in the 16th Century.\nNot just the same, this is the nonsense peddled by Calvin. It is the basis of the \"Reformed\" christian churches. It is Puritanism at its finest.\n \nIn order to believe this silliness, one must believe that God himself was a \"sinner\", the greatest of all perhaps. Man, we are told, was created in His image. If man is the \"sinful\" character Calvin declared him to be, and if he was created in the image of God, then God himself was the master \"sinner\".\nI think they escape the \"god as liar/sinner\" paradox by blaming it all on a mythical event called THE FALL.\n \nOn the other hand, the Master told us that the way to perfection was to love God and to treat one's neighbors as oneself.\nYou sound like Jefferson.\n \nSorry, but most rational people will not choose to love \"sinful\" things.\n \n That is, of course, provided that such a soul-crippling concept as \"sin\" exists in the first place.\n \n In actuality \"sin\" is a man-made concept tht was designed to keep the sheeple in line.\nNow you sound like Franklin too.\n \n Anyway, the above five points formed the basis of a lot of the religious fervor in the U.S. in the last half of the 18th century. These precepts were adopted in whole or in part by many Protestant confessions of faith and catechisms, including those of Lutheranism, Anglicanism and Methodism, Arminianism, and Calvinism., esp. Reformed, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, Reformed Baptist. These ideas were half of the basis of the evangelical movement known as the Great Awakening. Itinerant preachers wandered about preaching the 5 points on the one hand and stressing \"natural religion\" on the other. Historians seem to feel that the contradiction was responsible for the popularity of Deism in the U.S. that reached its greatest influence in the years of the Revolution and founding of the country, i.e., the Declaration and the Constitution.",

I'm not sure what your point is. Are you just wanting to express your disapproval of things John Calvin emphasized? Also, it could be argued that the U.S. wouldn't be here at all if not for a number of religious movements (after all many of the early settlers of the 'New World' were coming because there was freedom to have the religion they wanted.",
