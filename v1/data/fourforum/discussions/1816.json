A lot of the online pharmacies are not any cheaper (and in many cases more expensive) than a normal pharmacy because they are pretty much there to cater to junkies (pain meds).\n \n What kind of stuff are we talking? Antibiotics are available at vet supply houses and aquarium shops (pennicilin, etc...) and the stuff they sell at most aquarium shops is actualy higher purity than the FDA requires for human consuption (go figure). There are alternative sources for about every medication out there.\n \n Alternatively, you might look into getting into a prescription drug insurance program. These programs are usually pretty cheap. I offer it as a benifit to my employees and it only costs about $18/mo/per family. The program covers 80% of all prescription costs on name brands, 100% on generics. OUr health insurance picks up prescriptions also, and in that case the supplementary prescription program pays 100% of the portion not covered by your regular insurance.\n \n There are also \"group prescription\" type plans. They advertise these on TV (physicians prescription group). They can save you a pretty decent amount of money also.",

   "I am sorry to hear about your situation. Make sure that you only look at buying from pharmacies that require a precscription to order. The other suggestion is to shop around for the best prices. I think on average you will find most US pharmacies to be more expensive than Canadian. I have found that some international pharmacies (such as magendavidmeds) are cheaper than both US and Canadian pharmacies. Good luck Let me know if I can help in any way.",

Each website will give you links to the top nine online pharmacies where you can pull up new windows for each provider and compare prices. GMedOnline.com has American Pharmacies, and many provide you with an online doctor, so no prescription is required in many cases. You can save more money with the Canadian companies, but you will be required to fax a prescription most of the time. So expect to wait about two weeks. Remember that the FDA allows you to purchase up to a three month supply, when buying your meds online. Also, the Canadian pharmacies do not ship drugs that require refrigeration.\n \n Another great advantage to using the above sites is that you can buy everything there from PetMeds, banking/financial services and scotters/wheelchairs to a new battery for your car.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n Terral",
