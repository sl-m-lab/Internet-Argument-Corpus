   "Here is more proof that high ranking democrats have total disdain for out military............So Sad......\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159885,00.html\n \n GOP to Dems: Denounce Durbin Remarks \n Friday, June 17, 2005\n \n \n WASHINGTON - GOP leaders called on their Democratic counterparts Friday to denounce the comments of Sen. Dick Durbin (search), who earlier this week blasted the Guantanamo detainee camp. \n \n House Republicans sent House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (search) a letter asking her to publicly condemn the No. 2 Senate Democrat's comments.\n \n \"Does the speech made by Senator Durbin also reflect your views as the House Democratic Leader? If not, we respectfully request that you publicly renounce Senator Durbin's comments. These sorts of irresponsible comments send the wrong message to our soldiers,\" stated the letter signed by House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and three other GOP leaders.\n \n And Sen. Sam Brownback (search), R-Kan., told FOX News that he thinks Durbin's remarks are \"clearly over the top.\"\n \n Brownback urged lawmakers critical of the Guantanamo Bay prison facility to back away from talk advocating the camp's closure. \"I would really hope that most people would back away from that and start focusing on the War on Terror,\" Brownback said.\n \n On Thursday evening, Durbin went to the Senate floor to repeat the controversial statement he made two days earlier and insist he said nothing objectionable.",

There are no WMD. There are no production facilities. THere are no storage facilities. There are no indications of shipments. There are no training facilities.\n \n How do dems hate the military if they are aganist putting troops in needless danger for a mission that does not help America?\n \n You have clearly avoided that question at least 15 times.

Critisizing the government isn't just a right, it's the most important duty a citizen has. The only way a democracy can continue to work is if elected officials are under the constant scrutiny of the people, and if the people speak up loud and clear every time they see something they don't like. It doesn't matter how many votes a person or an issue got. It doesn't matter if the person protesting is a minority of 1, or if it's every person in the country. Every citizen must make their voice be heard if they disagree with the government. And anyone who does or says anything to prevent that is being as un-American and un-Democratic (as in Democracy, not the party, duh) as they can possibly be.",

Look forward, don't get stuck in the past.\n \n A majority of the US public is now expressing dissatisfaction with government policy managing the Iraq situation. They're not blaming the military, they're faulting their elected representatives who put the military in harm's way. That is our moral obligation, to question, criticize and demand responsible performance from those representatives, responsibility being why is our military detaining and killing citizens from other nations and in that process, being killed? In a democratic republic, military actions reflect directly on the public who elected those representatives who issue orders to that military.
