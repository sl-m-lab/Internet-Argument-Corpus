The attacker (Jason Hamilton) killed four people, injured two, and shot 205 rounds of ammunition. Three armed individuals were present at the scene and were unable to stop the attacker. Finally, a SWAT team was called in. \n \n A few years ago there was a mass shooting in a mall in Seattle. A person with a concealed carry permit and a handgun was present who was unable to stop the shooting. Out of all the victims, the person with a handgun was the most seriously injured.\nEven if you provided links and I read the entire press release I would not say these are good arguments to limit guns. Every situation stands on it's own. The Texas Tower shooter was hard to bring down because of his superior position and long range fire power. For all I know, your Jason Hamilton could have been wearing a vest. If out of all the people injured in Seattle the gunman was most seriously injured, it must be that nobody died. This hardly qualifies as a comparitive incident.\n \n In either case, there is no reason to conclude that the presence of hundreds of armed citizens could not have stopped the shooter...dead in his tracks.\n \n \n\n Australia hasn't had any problems with mass shootings since it banned semiautomatic rifles and pump action shotguns more than 10 years ago. \n So it seems to me that the only way you can reach the conclusion that gun free zones are a cause of mass shootings is by ignoring a lot of the evidence out there.\nWhere have other mass shootings happened? Please list only those instances that compare with this recent school shooting. I will not accept a romance driven murder-suicide as a mass shooting. List all the mass shootings of the past century, if you will. I believe you'll find that schools top the list. It's hard to conclude that the knowledge that others will be virtually unarmed does not contribute to the choice of venues be the shooter.\n \n Another facet to consider regarding schools is that they are a large source of rejection and ridicule to the group of us who are on the brink of mental delusion anyway....and the level of rejection or ridicule required to trigger the violence runs the gamut from miniscule to significant. A bright student may be set off by receiving a grade of \"C\" rather than the \"A\" he might think he deserves.\n \n Churches are not far behind as a source of rejection and ridicule.\n \n \n\n According to guncite.com only 14% of homes in Switzerland have a fully automatic weapon in them. \n http://guncite.com/swissgun.html\n\n \n What percentage of homes in the U.S.A. have fully automatic weapons in them? Are you trying to relate the per capita ownership of Uzzies to the likelihood of school shoots? How many school shootings have utilized fully automatic weapons?\n \n I haven't seen photos of the weapons this recent shooter used. I do not doubt that I will. When the police photos are made public, they will likely be published in some tabloid along with photos of his last hotel room, the bags of ammunition, his guitar case, his last set of clothes, his childhood pictures, pictures of his father trying to get the news media out of his face. We already know his age and may someday learn how to spell his surname since it gets published on every newscast related to the shooting.\n \n Come to think of it, the media is giving all who will listen the makings of a school shooter starter kit. \"See kids! You just hide all these weapons in a guitar case and walk right into the school...just like Antonia Bandaris in that cool, fictional movie wherein he dodges millions of bullets and blows away people who are shooting back at him with Uzzies in small rooms where nobody can shoot straight except him...\"",

That's like believing a mugger to say to his victim \"You're damn lucky that murder's illegal, because I really wanted to kill you dead\". If a student was going to kill a teacher because of a bad grade they could just as easily bring a gun to school illegally, it's not like the current laws are preventing that from happening. If current laws were doing anything to prevent school killings, we never would've had last week's incident because it would've been absolutely impossible.\n \n The same students are allowed to legally carry anywhere else that their permit is good, and school is hardly the only stressful place their life is involved with.

   "Fair enough, Dane. I just wanted to see if your evaluation of my sanity would be based upon my willingness to agree with your opinion. Do you really believe that if I disagree with you and refuse to accept your wisdom then this must be evidence of some form of mental illness? I have a copy of the DSM IV, but I can't seem to find a disorder titled \"does not agree with me.\" Oh, I realize I solicited a free psychological opinion and I shouldn't complain about getting what I paid for. Please understand that I took your diagnosis as being made tongue-in-cheek, and I hope you'll take my response the same. I'll just note we are going to have a hard time getting into a productive discussion if you are unwilling to accept that reasonable people may disagree on these issues. \n \n Now let me address the answer you gave to allowing CCW on campus: \"A lot more dead students and staff.\" \n \n I have carried concealed on school property before, and amazingly everyone has survived unscathed. I guess I never realized how lucky I was to avoid the predicted outcome of such an awful prophecy. \n \n Did you also make the \"a lot more dead people\" prediction when we learned the Florida legislature wanted to greatly expand its CCW law? The Brady Campaign argued that Florida would become Dodge City, and minor traffic accidents would become gun battles. How many incidents have we had since the CCW went into effect?\n \n Was this your argument when my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia greatly relaxed its CCW law a decade ago? The same argument was made then by opponents of the measure. Can you tell me how many CCW permit holders in my state have committed a crime with a firearm? There are several more states that have adopted CCW permit laws. Can you find one in which the passage of the law resulted in \"a lot more dead people?\"\n \n And for that matter, wasn't the \"a lot more dead people\" argument made against the proposal to allow pilots to carry firearms again? How many dead people have we had in the last five years in which we have permitted them to become armed again? But let me come back to students specifically.... \n \n We trust these students to make calculations which help NASA guide a spacecraft to Mars. We trust them to enter and make use of nuclear reactor facilities. We trust them to handle and learn about infectious diseases. We trust them to operate on people in teaching hospitals. The State that issues them a CCW permit trusts them to carry concealed when they go grocery shopping at Food Lion, and when they buy a cheeseburger at the local McDonalds. Tell me what evidence you have to suggest these same people suddenly decompensate and become untrustworthy the moment they set foot on campus, only to become rehabilitated when they leave and go home to their off campus apartments or to the video store. \n \n Isn't you real argument that students should never be allowed to have a permit to carry concealed any where for any reason, or are you suggesting that they can be trusted to carry concealed while shopping on aisle 7 for ice cream-but they cannot be trusted to carry concealed while learning about geology or history? \n \n ---\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\" Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting with approval 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.",

The Bill of Rights is a document protecting the individual rights of citizens exclusively, dictating what the government isn't allowed to do.

   "I'm sorry to have to disagree with a fellow member of the Nation, but here goes. Redsoxlvr13, I know you claim years of expertise as a student, but I discount your claim of expertise in this field and I don't trust you on this issue. \n \n I tend to avoid oversimplification through statistics because they do not take into account the social and economic factors which are the real engines of violence in America. But since statistics seem to be the flavor of the day, let's look at the most recent reported per capita murder rates which are relevant to your chosen example of D.C.\n \n (These are taken from http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/offenses/standard_links/state.html. These per capita rates reflect the reported total number of intentional homicides per 100,000 residents per year):\n \n 2005 2006\n \n National Average 5.6 5.7 \n Virginia 6.1 5.2\n Maryland 9.9 9.6\n D.C. 33.5 29.1\n \n Now tell me why the murder rates are so much lower in the two neighboring states. Is it, as you suggest, the \"big business\" of gun running? I cannot disagree more with that argument. Handguns are both easier and cheaper to obtain in Virginia and Maryland. There is no ban that drives up the price and forces people to illegally \"run\" guns into the neighboring jurisdictions of, for example, the City of Alexandria and Fairfax County, Virginia. Yet in 2006, D.C. had 169 murders, while across the river Alexandria had 7 and Fairfax County reported none. The statistics, regardless of whether they are raw total numbers or the more accurate per capita calculations, simply do not support your assertion. \n \n To say if we took away all guns then we would stop all gun murders is nothing more than saying if we took away all cars we would stop all DUI fatalities. Do you believe that the presence of a firearm contributes to the motive to commit a murder-or as Homer once said: \"the blade itself incites to violence\"? \n \n ---\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\" Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting with approval 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.",

You're wrestling a strawman.\n \n Legislation against the irresponsible few rather than for the responsible majority is a fact of life.\n\n \n Well that's an interesting point. I too prefer placing the emphasis on the guilty few as opposed to the many innocent. I think the current topic of alcohol would make an excellent example: \n \n Someone wakes you in the middle of the night by beating on your door. You answer the door, and several officers ask to come inside. You invite them in because you know yourself to be law abiding and have nothing to hide. They then raid your fridge and start collecting your beer. You ask them what's going on, and they reply \"we just caught someone driving under the influence across town, and now we can't trust you to have any beer.\" \n \n This is how gun control works. It punishes the innocent for the crimes of the wicked. It seeks to take away a right from truly innocent persons without any imputation or even suspicion of offence.\n \n In all other aspects involving our Bill of Rights the goal of the law has been to attempt its object by means that are the least restrictive of these precious rights. Wherever possible such laws should not punish the innocent for the crimes of the guilty. Yet when guns become the issue those who lack both foresight and patience for constitutional rights are quick to demand that we should take a bottle \"white out\" to the Bill of Rights and re-write a portion of it. \n \n Their \"collective right\" interpretation of the RKBA makes the following argument: \"The phrase 'the right of the people' means an individual right in the 1st. Amendment, is somehow mutated into a collective right of the states in the 2nd. Amendment, but fortunately enough reverts back to mean an individual right in the 4th. Amendment.\" \n \n The irony is that I have friends who are gun control fans who have stood with me in the past when the right threatened is one they also choose to enjoy. Yet when it comes to the RKBA, my more moderate gun control supporting friends will blanch and fall silent. They allow their principles to be overrun by those who are ruled by their own fear-men who incessantly shout their demand that the only way to assuage their fear is to destroy the right of the many because of the crimes of the few, regardless of the Orwellian \"double think\" required to reach that desired outcome. \n \n The real danger is not that such arguments are made against the RKBA, however. The far greater danger comes from how blissfully ignorant such fools are to the unwitting encourage they provide for others to use the same arguments to eliminate other rights in the Bill of Rights which they feel obstruct their goals. \n \n ---\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Olmstead v.

   "Rubbish. I had a glass of wine last night. I managed not to do anything irresponsible.\n \n @Bryan, exactly. So current laws against possession and use of drugs are an infringement of your civil liberties.\n\n \n \n I disagree, Count Otto. Let me first comment that laws which infringe upon a right do not necessarily equal an unconstitutional infringement on the right. Laws regulating slander, libel, false advertising, and incitement to riot infringe upon the rights of speech and press, but they do not offend the constitution. This is because no right is absolute, and the individual RKBA is also subject to rational limitation.\n \n The more conclusive answer to your analogy of drug usage, however, is that it is not a recognized civil liberty interest. I have looked in more than one location for a proposed right to smoke weed, and I cannot seem to find it. \n \n Natural law is a beginning source of recognized civil liberties, and searching there we find the natural law right of self defense, of which we find RKBA is merely a part. I can find nothing in the writings of men like Aristotle or Locke or Hobbes, to name a few examples, which support a natural law right of smoking marijuana (admittedly, however, I did not consider the writings of Timothy Leary nor did I review the ill fated presidential campaign of George McGovern). \n \n I have looked for support for a marijuana civil liberty interest in the wording of my constitution, where I have found a recognized RKBA. But I can find no amendment numbered 2.1 which reads \"the right of the people to grow and use marijuana shall not be infringed.\" \n \n Having failed to find a civil liberty of drug use in these locations, I turned at last to the \"penumbra\" doctrine and the theory of \"substantive due process,\" which says some rights not stated in the Constitution are still protected by its reach (abortion being the most recognized example found by SCOTUS). This theory was best described in a former minority opinion quote which has gained favor with more than one current SCOTUS justice: \n \n \"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This \"liberty\" is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment. Poe v. Ullman, supra, 367 U.S., at 543.\" (Justice Stevens used this quote in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S.266 (1994), which involved a civil lawsuit brought by Albright under a claim he had been denied \"due process\" of law when he was charged and arrested for a crime without a finding of probable cause that he had committed the crime. Justice O'Conner (now retired) used this quote in her majority opinion in the abortion rights case of PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SE PA. v. CASEY, 505 U.S. 833, 6 (1992), which was joined with approval by current Justices Kennedy and Souter.) \n \n I can find no support for the argument that the activities of smoking marijuana or crack or injecting heroin would fall within the \"rational continuum\" of unexpressed but protected due process clause liberty interests. \n \n I would not, therefore, agree that the RKBA and the desire to smoke marijuana bear any rational comparison. The RKBA has a demonstrated 2000+ year history of writers who have recognized the importance of the right. The RKBA was an accepted part of the recognized natural law of self defense at the time of our revolution, and it has been specifically included as a recognized individual right within my Constitution. Drug usage, on the other hand, appears to depend on the argument that one should be free to do what I want to do when I want to do it. Law that infringe upon drug usage may infringe upon what some believe to be a \"right,\" but it is most definitely not recognized as a legitimate civil liberty interest. \n \n --- \n \n \"For those who can possess and wield arms are in a position to decide whether the constitution is to continue or not.\" Aristotle, Politics, T. Sinclair Trans. 1962, p. 274.\n \n \"And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim.\" Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n \n \"If a slave, says Plato, defends himself, and kills a freeman, he ought to be treated as a parricide. This is a civil law which punishes self-defense, though dictated by nature. . . .It is unreasonable. . .to oblige a man not to attempt the defense of his own life. . . .Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .[T]he laws of an Italian republic, where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things.\" Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans. T. Nugent, 1899).\n \n \"[A] covenant not to defend myself by force, from force, is always void. For. . .no man can transfer, or lay down his Right to save himself from Death.\" Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, pp. 88 & 95, (1964 ed.)\n \n \"Whereas, by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute power and will of the legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him, to make prey of them when he pleases. . . .For then mankind will be in a far worse condition than in the state of nature, if they shall have armed one, or a few men, with the joint power of a multitude to force them to obey at pleasure the exorbitant and unlimited decrees of their sudden thoughts, or unrestrained, and, til that moment, unknown wills, without having any measures set down which may guide and justify their actions.\" John Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government, pp. 114-15 (Chicago, 1955)\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300.",

This is where you wheel out some spurious stats from the NRA despite the fact that I've already told you I live in Britain and supplied the relevant Home Office stats showing that our murder rate (and especially gun murder rate) is much lower than yours.\n\n \n What good would it do? No matter how many times I or anybody else proves that you're wrong and that you're not safe in Britain, and how this fact is magnified by the fact that your police are being equipped with guns rather than just simple nightsticks, you choose to remain eternally in the dark, in mass denial because your mind can't wrap itself around the fact that the great gun ban was a massive failure.",
