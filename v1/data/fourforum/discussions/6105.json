   "First of all, I come from a socialist and atheist home. If I am expressing this in a way that Christians feel is insulting then I apologize, cause that's not the intent. I am not saying this cause I want to prove anything, I'm saying it cause this is the version of the sotry that fascinates me. Maybe it will fascinate someone else. \n \n One of the apocryphical texts that was edited out of the NT deals in detail with Mary and Joseph. Mary's mother was appearntly pretty old when she finally got pregnant, not totally unlike the story of Sara. To show God their gratitude for this blessing her parents decided to place Mary in the temple at the tender age of three. \n \n She stayed there until she reached puberty, around 15, at which time the priests thought it was inappropriate for her to be there. She was to be taken care of by one of the town's widowers and by lottery Joseph was chosen. He was sort of reluctant but accpeted her eventually. Pretty soon after he brought her to his house he had to go off on a job, to build a house. During this time Mary was \"visited by an angel\" and when Joseph came back she was 5 months pregnant. \n \n He got really upset and asked her who she had been sleeping with. She \"cried bitter tears\" and said that \"there was no man\". Joseph didn't believe her but in his dreams that night God came to him and told him what had happened and that he was now going to take care of this sacred baby and its mother. Soon they were both called to the temple and the priests asked Joseph what the hell he had been doing. C'mon now, you can tell us. She's young and pretty, we get it. But he said he hadn't slept with her. So they asked Mary who she had been with and she again \"creeid bitter tears\". The priest didn't believe this either right away and they were both sent out into the desert to be tested. But when they came back and were fine the priests decided that if God couldn't find any fault with them then neither would they. \n \n Of course I don't believe that \"there was no man\". Of course she had been with someone when Joseph was away. No harm in that and bless the girl for telling a lie about it, one that eventually the whole world accepted. But here a much more interesting story than the one in the tradition emerges. \n \n It is the story of the bastard son, brought up by his very young mom (who probably taught him something about creating drama) and his pretty old step-dad (who taught him a profession). A boy who was in his young years very, very cocky and often mean. He gave his parents a lot of grief, hurting for instance the teachers he had that he thought were way too stupid for his quick intelect.\n \n Soon enough he noticed that he had the gift, the gift to speak in such a way that it moved peoples' hearts. So he started talking. Like everyone else he hated the Roman Empire, and those high priests that had sold out to the Romans. And he thought the old traditions were a bit stale. As the years passed he got a following and eventually they were able to march into Jerusalem, with Jesus riding on a donkey for symbolical reasons and they also managed to take over the temple and hold it for three days until he was bertayed and killed like a common criminal.\n \n Which meant for most Jews that he couldn't be the Messiah, something he had alluded to to gain power, cause had he been the Romans would have been crushed just like the Egyptians. This old slave people needed a savior once again, but this wasn't the one. \n \n After his death his followers were scared. However, the memory of this freedom fighter lived on and the stories about him started to live their own life. It took a few centuries for things to move in such a way that the stories about him could be gathered into a book, edited to make it more understandable, cause some of the stories were really weird. Ironically this came about during the same time as the Roman Empire started to fall, something I'm sure Jesus would have loved to see with his own eyes.",

   "The Anvil that Has Worn Out Many Hammers\n \n Nineteenth century writer H.L. Hastings once forcibly illustrated the unique way in which the Bible has withstood the attacks of skepticism: \n \n \"Infidels of eighteen hundred years have been refuting and overthrowing this book, and yet it stands today as solid as a rock. Its circulation increases, and it is more loved and cherished and read today than ever before. Infidels, with all their assaults, make about as much impression on this book as a man with a tack hammer would on the Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n \"When the French monarch proposed the persecution of Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him, 'Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.' So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives.\"\n \n \"No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism?

I hardly think they are inept at bringing out the word meanings, important themes, people, events, and archaeological places, etc., that we see in Scripture. \n\n \n As already pointed out you missed the point I was making. The problem with translating is sometimes that the words in one langauge simply aren't found in another one. Like the example I gave you with Adam. There's nothing we can do about it if we translate it to english or swedish cause the words for woman, soil and the color red do not sound the same in our languages no matter how hard we try. So, we'd have to eqxplain this in the notes, which would be OK but not have the same poetic value at all. \n \n I'll give you an example from my own world. I've read part of Nagarjuna's Mulamadhymakakarika in sanskrit. Already in the first verse I'd run into serious trouble translating some of the words, espcially one of them, not because I don't know the meaning but simply because a word like prapanchopashama (or to be specific the first part of that compound, prapancha) has such a vast meaning it takes up a full page to explain it fully. There's been a thesis written on that word alone. Which again doesn't mean that it's so very hard to understand, it's just not possible to translate it well in that context and stay within the boundaries of the one verse. \n \n For the Bible to have any sort of flow for the reader the translators would have to make these descisions all the time, which words to translate more accurately and which ones to interpret more freely (which doesn't necessarily mean more incorrectly). \n \n As for the Bible being a very truthful historical document... there are none. Historical documents are always to be thought of as less than truthful. They were always written by someone for someone else. As we are doing now, the people of the old days put their ideas into words because they wanted to pass on their point of view. I'm sure the poepole of Jericho would have written a different story had they been given the chance. The winners write history.",

   "To illustrate my point further I'll try to explain prapancha to you. It's a good word, well worth knowing something about. The main part of the word, cause even prapancha is a sort of compound, is pancha, which means five. This is the same as in the drink punch, which originally had five ingredients. It is the same as in Punjab, which means \"five rivers\". And it is the same as in the greek word penta, as in pentagram. Panch is an indo-european root that means five in many languages. In fact, since f replaces p, five is the same word, just sounds a bit different. \n \n The prefix pra creates something entirely different however. Already in the word pancha there is the sense of \"spreading out\" but with pra before it this becomes even more so. Prapancha is the spread out, the fully drawn out, the total of something. The prapancha of you is everything about you. Everything that's been said about you, everything that you've done, everything that has any connection with you. Your prapancha is the intellectual process of thinking about you. Prapancha in a general sense, as it is used in that first verse in Nagarjuna's great treatise (which dates back to the 3rd century most probably) is the intellectual dances we do, the thoughts and argumentations we fall into, the traps of the analytical mind.\n \n The whole compound in the verse is prapanchopashama, so there's more to it that just prapancha, there's upashama too. Shama means peace and upa simply strenghtens it. See, sometimes it's easy to translate! Together they become... and before you laugh I suggest you try it... \"the bringing to peace of the analytical mind\"... or... as you see, that translation leaves some of the meaning out... so maybe something like \"the bringing to peace of the intellect\" would be good but that seems to mean something else too... \n \n Whatever we finally translate it as it will not sound as good as prapanchopashama sounds and it will not fit the meter of the verse, which the original word also does. And that's important for you to remember here EZ cause the Bible is also written in verse, at least OT. Take away the poetry and something is forever lost to the reader.",

When I heard it spoken, it sounded very odd. Not only was the beat off, but the story seemed very mixed up and unorganized (it was something about a hedgehog).

And there's tons of such examples throughout history books.\n\n \n Good point actually, and was about to say something earlier but felt it was too mean... but you brought me right to it. In the case of the NT for instance history is at first written down by a bunch of complete losers, in the worldly sense of the word. Cause Jesus is one of the biggest losers to have lived,a nd the people who wrote about him did definitely write about someone who was beaten, although according to them that was only half of the story. \n \n Things changed and powers changed and that's why we now have something called Christianity. It's the same way with buddhism BTW. Being buddhist and all I still have to admit that it's true what a muslim from Kashmeer told me about a year and a half ago (on a very long bus ride from Shree Nagar) \"This buddhism you know, it wouldn't have existed without a war\". The thing is that if king Ashoka had not invaded Kalinga and due to the remorse he felt after that \"converted\" to buddhism we might not ever have heard of the Buddha. Until then buddhism was a small sect among other insignificant sects. Ashoka united most of India and favored buddhism a lot during his lifetime. Without that support buddhism wouldn't have spread outside of Bengal. \n \n \nPerhaps you can document one major historical gaffe in the New Testament?

You STILL are dependant on reading that phrase out of context. \n \n And yes,, the way of a man with a young woman in the context of the rest of the poetry is talking about a man making love to a woman. No matter how much you whine and complain , if you read the entire passages, rather than depending on one sentance, it doesn't mean what you say it does.\n \n \n\n Now, Trebor, why don't you give me the Hebrew word other than almah that always signifies a \"virgin\" in Hebrew, so that I can demolish that case? Also, give me a Greek word that always signifies virgin (apart from parthenos, which itself is open to attack)?\n \n\n \n Bethulah.\n \n And before you whine and complain, and try to say that isn't true because of Joel 1.8, I will answer that Israel is being compared to a virgin widow to make it more poignant. \n \n \n\n \n I hope you do better at all this than when I asked you for the Jewish profile of the Messiah, which you apparently are still stumped on and never could come up with.

Therefore, she was also referred to as a virgin (\"almah\"). \"Almah,\" therefore, must refer to a young woman who is also a virgin.\n \n Second, Jewish Rabbi Radak, in his commentary on Isaiah 7:14, believes that the word almah could mean virgin: \"Elem means young boy, the male, and almah means young girl [naarah].

   "The Jewish concept of the Messiah is HUMAN being that will bring peace ot the world, make the Torah the center of religious worship, and be King over all of Israel.

This is the name by which He will be called; The Lord our Righteousness (YHVH Tseidkeynu).'\n \n The Targums concluded that this passage was also speaking of Messiah. \n \n The great Jewish Rabbi David Kimchi wrote in reference to this verse, 'By the righteous Branch is meant Messiah.' The compilers of the Targum agreed with Kimchi since they introduced Messiah by name in this passage.

   "This is probably a good a time as any to introduce you to the concept that translation almost always involves interpretation, and that interpretation carries its own set of problems with regard to accuracy. The classic example of this is Matthew's rendering of \"maiden\" in Isaiah 7:14 to mean \"virgin\". I trust you understand the difference. Regardless, a considerable number of Christian bibles now use the term \"maiden\" or \"young woman\" as opposed to \"virgin\" in Isaiah 7:14.\n\n \n \nSilly man. A maiden or young woman was always assumed to be a virgin in Israel at that time anyway unless there was compelling evidence against her, so you stike out either way. Plus the fact that if what Terje says is true, then I can't trust your argument either, because it's lost to history. Either way you lose.\n\n \n Wherein EZ thrashes about in desperation. \n \n What I'm going to provide you below is something which has been explained to you many times in the past by many people. That you refuse to accept it is of little concern to me because I fully understand that you are determined to defend your positions at all cost. \n \n The Hebrew word almah is used to describe a young woman and says nothing about her state of virginity. The Hebrew word betulah designates a woman of any age who happens to be a virgin. Am I going too fast for you? Now, let's consider Isaiah 7:14...\n \n Look, the young woman is with child and about to give birth to a son. - JPS Tanakh, Jewish\n \n Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son. - NRSV Study Bible, Christian\n \n Notice the present tense \"is\". That is significant because this verse addresses a time and a series of events which occured approx. 700 years before the birth of Jesus. Regardless, the author chose to use almah, i.e., \"young woman\". If the woman's virginity was a consideration, don't you think that Isaiah would have used the word betulah which describes a virgin? Obviously, he didn't do this, did he? No, he didn't. \n \n I mention this only to reinforce my earlier observation to you that translation from one language to another involves interpretation, and that sometimes such interpretation can be in error.",

It does not mean that it is King David's Palace. \n \n From http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/05/international/middleeast/05jerusalem.html\n \n \n\n Even Israeli archaeologists are not so sure that Ms. Mazar has found the palace - the house that Hiram, king of Tyre, built for the victorious king, at least as Samuel 2:5 describes it. It may also be the Fortress of Zion that David conquered from the Jebusites, who ruled Jerusalem before him, or some other structure about which the Bible is silent.\n \n\n \n It will be interesting to see what kind of evidence for the claims is found on the site. I hope that Ms Mazar won't pull a Vendyl Jones or a Ron Wyatt, and claim fantasic events with out of context evidence. \n \n It is a good nest of evidence. Let us see what the evidence actually provides\n before making unwarrented assumptions. I notice that \"Crusaders for Christ\" leaped to a conclusion, as did Easyrider. Not very schoarly of them.",
