Is there an objective measure for it that you're aware science has?\n \n \"AUSTRALIAN PAIN SOCIETY\n November 2002\n Position Statement\n The Role of the Psychologist in the Management of Persistent Pain\n \"The subjective experience of pain may occur in the absence of objectively demonstrable tissue damage. It is not a purely physical phenomenon, but has highly significant psychological components.\"\n See article \"The Role of the Psychologist in the Management of Persistent Pain\" linked at http://www.apsoc.org.au/public.html.\n That is pain is real, in that it has physical characteristics, and, you might feel pain to a degree that is subjective, even without any 'real' (in your terms - because it's objective) reason. Thus how do you measure your pain against mine? Thus science may not 'detect' it through physical proofs, but they don't say it doesn't exist. It exists in the natural world. The pain can cause real symptoms to occur. As such there is an to dealing with pain; called psychology, though its methods would not be wholly non-material. Does this count?\n \n Science can state that it recognises differences, but how is it measured?\n Sex differences in pain perception have been noted in multiple studies, with women typically displaying lower pain tolerance than men, but it is unknown whether the mechanisms underlying these differences are hormonal, genetic or psychosocial in origin. For example, some researchers have suggested that men are more motivated to express a tolerance for pain because masculine stereotyping encourages it, while feminine stereotyping encourages pain expression and lower pain tolerance.\n http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-04/cfta-hpt040903.php\n In other words, if there is a difference, it could be for any number of reasons.\n \n What about Chronic Pain?\n \"Chronic pain: When no physical cause can be found\"\n Pain is, by its very nature, subjective. It is not tangible. X-rays and lab tests can't \"see\" pain.\n http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/PN/00034.html\n \n I am not an expert in this, and will not be upset if this is debunked successfully. I am not even sure whether you'd accept this under your lines of argument. I look forward to constructive input you might have on the matter.",

Given the highly individual nature of people and they illnesses they suffer I suppose this is not surprising.\n \n In the case of injury awareness of the the likelyhood of impending injury also effects how it is felt. A person who sees an injury coming will feel its effects very strongly and quickly whereas someone caught unawares may not feel much discomfort at all as their nervous system floods the brain with messages that cannot be immediately understood.\n \n Other things effect how people behave- damage to areas of the brain and release of endomorphins/adrenaline can mask a persons comprehension of an injury allowing some very serious injurys to go unfelt for many hours.\n \n \n Still, pain is a result of nervous impulses that are interpreted by the brain to produce a comprehensible feeling.
