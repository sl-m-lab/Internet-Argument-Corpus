And yet much is down to interpretation. After all the very idea of the resurrection can be seen as celebration of death in a way. \n \n Rice doesn't glorify evil as such but instead injects humanity into our perception of evil. The Vampire in her novels is rarely one to be envied. Seeing humanity in even that which at first glance looks to be without it is certainly a notion compatible with Christianity.\n \n In the end, it depends on if one is capable of looking past such terms as 'vampire', and instead seeing them as metaphors for aspects of humanity within us all.\n \n In case you can't tell, I'm quite a fan of the books!",
