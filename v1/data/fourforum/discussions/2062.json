   "Behavior, Discrimination, and Marriage\n \n Comparing gay marriage to biracial marriages and civil rights is not a comparison. Myself a minority I feel insulted to have race compared with behavior. Laws in our land are all designed to govern behavior. We don't pass laws that govern race, gender, or ethnicity. We pass laws that we feel will protect society or advance a public interest. When there were laws in place banning interracial marriages, the laws were based on race. Jim Crow laws and every other law that based application on race are considered unconstitutional because they regulated race.\n Now every law we have now regulates behavior we feel is in the public interest. All laws are morally based. We say it's illegal to sell drugs. It is unlawful to be publicly lewd. It is permissible to sell pornography. Our laws are based upon our morals however we feel is right. Many times it doesn't make sense to everyone but it's what our legislatures believes is right and moral and therefore passes laws. We pass laws on the thought \"what is right for one is right for all.\" If same sex marriage were right for everyone they would pass laws protecting that. The legislature defines what is moral not the courts. They define it by the laws. When a court makes new laws they exceed their power. They should only interpret the law not create it. \n Many argue that it is not behavior but genetic. There is no definitive evidence that suggest homosexuality is genetic. There is as much evidence to suggest that homosexuality is genetic as there is to suggest that other behavior disorders are genetic. There are however thousands of \"gays\" who have changed. Many say that those that have changed were really not gays. If that is the case then drug addicts that quit were really never addicts.\n The fact is that we decide what should be moral by what we consider legal. Many make the argument that passing a marriage amendment would be discriminatory. If that is true everything in the constitution would be discriminatory. The constitution discriminates against naturalized citizens and citizens born outside the US from becoming President. It discriminates against citizens under 18 from voting. It discriminates against everyone from making Presidential appointments. It's full of discrimination. A constitutional amendment would guarantee that all men and women have the right to marry. It would give a gay woman as much a right to marry a man, as a straightl man to marry a woman. It is not discriminatory. It limits our behavior. We cannot marry multiple times, relatives, or same sex. It applies to everyone equally. Everyone has the same rights.\n Many do not believe that the institution of marriage is worth saving. They point out to the 50% divorce rate and the short lived marriages of celebrities. They point to the infidelity of spouses and various other problems with marriage. The fact is that most marriages do succeed. People that divorce, generally divorce multiple times skewing the 50% ratio. The fact that people fail at marriage does not necessitate lowering the standard of marriage. People that point to failing marriages and asking we lower our standards is like pointing to failing grades and asking schools to lower their standards. We should tighten up the requisites of marriage to ensure it isn't trivialized.\n Marriage has rights and protection. Gays want those rights and protections. Many others do too. Today we see many relatives and friends living together because financially or for health reasons cannot afford to live alone. They share the bills and grow to love each other. The love is not a passionate love of attraction. Shouldn't they have the same rights as gay couples? If we are to give gay couples \"rights\", give it to everyone. There are more that need it then gays. What makes them deserve it anymore than anyone else? Marriage is a commitment that men make to women and women to men to love them and provide for them and their children regardless of what happens. Marriage protects that commitment couples make to their wives and children. It is something that spans all cultures, races, and genders. We need to protect that not trivialize it. Marriage celebrates life. After all if it is right for one its right for all.",

But (generally) there is valid backing for such laws, i.e., four year olds are not likely to be able to operate a motor vehicle very safely. Some amount of limitation is a good thing, it's a safety measeure. It is not, however, discrimination. Discrimination exists for the sole purpose of hurting a group. Denying marriage to gay couples is not a safety measure. Gays simply make some people uncomfortable. Well tough. Maybe your shoes make me uncomfortable, but if they do me no damage that's MY PROBLEM.

If I die they can physicallly distinguish my race and gender.\n \n Homosexuality is behavior. There is no way to measure or distinguish homosexuality. If we all died there is nothing that they could definitively prove physically who was gay and who wasn't. Everything in science indicates it is a disorder. It is not the common natuer of man if you believe science or religon or both they say homosexuality is deviant just as pedophilia.\n Also there are thousands that have reformed from homosexuality proving it is not as physical as race or gender.\n \n Religion is a personal and inalienable belief. It is considered the essence of men. Whatever we believe, religion is not limited in terms of our belief. However the law does limit our behavior.

I could locate only 11 reports in the professional literature or under review for publication concerning individuals involved in ex-gay ministries. The extent and degree of impact, positive or negative, of these ministries is currently impossible to gauge....\" Elsewhere in the article Throckmorton states (1) \"...there are only a few published empirical reports concerning the experiences of ex-gays;\" (2) \"This review does not answer the controversial question, Do ex-gay ministries help people change sexual orientation?\"; and (3) \"Neither gay-affirmative nor ex-gay interventions should be assumed to be the preferred approach to recommend to clients presenting with concerns over sexual identity....\".\n \n (continuted)...\n In this regard, the studies reviewed in Throckmorton's June, 2002, article involved a combined aggregate of 1,490 individuals. When the acknowledged failure rate of the participants in these studies is factored in, the studies themselves yield a far smaller number which does not supports the claim of \"thousands of people\").

   " This link does not mention homosexuality. Here is a better link...\n http://www.psych.org/public_info/homose~1.cfm\n\n \n If the psychopathology of \"Gender Identity Disorder of Childhood\" is one of the major etiological precursors to adulthood homosexual orientation disturbance (as the research indicates at present), it would now appear logical that homosexuality per se be re-examined as a mental disorder.\n \n In 1973, after several years of bitter dispute, the Board of Trustees of the American Psychiatric Association decided to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual... Instead of being engaged in a sober consideration of data, psychiatrists were swept up in a political controversy. The American Psychiatric Association had fallen victim to the disorder of a tumultuous era, when disruptive conflicts threatened to politicize every aspect of American social life. A furious egalitarianism that challenged every instance of authority had compelled psychiatric experts to negotiate the pathological status of homosexuality with homosexuals themselves. The result was not a conclusion based on an approximation of the scientific truth as dictated by reason, but was instead an action demanded by the ideological temper of the times... (Bayer, 1981, pages 3-4).\n It remains to be seen if the mental health professions will be able to readdress the issue of homosexuality from a logical and scientific perspective in the near future (Lundy & Rekers, 1995b, 1995c). The use (or abuse) of research may continue to be influenced by ideological factors in American culture (Lundy & Rekers, 1995a).\n \n http://www.leaderu.com/jhs/rekers.html\n \n http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Homosexuality%20and%20psychology\n \n http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Sexual%20deviant\n \n Controversy rages as to whether homosexuality should be regarded as a pathological deviation of normal sexualdevelopment or as a normal variant of the human potential for sexual response. Recently, this controversy hasfocused on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-II)where homosexuality is listed as an official diagnosis in the section on Sexual deviations.The proponents of the view that homosexuality is a normal variant of human sexuality argue for the elimination ofany reference to homosexuality in a manual of psychiatric disorders because it is scientifically incorrect, encouragesan adversary relationship between psychiatry and the homosexual community, and is misused by some peopleoutside of our profession who wish to deny civil rights to homosexuals. Those who argue that homosexuality is apathological disturbance in sexual development assert that to remove homosexuality from the nomenclature wouldbe to give official sanction to this form of deviant sexual development, would be a cowardly act of succumbing tothe pressure of a small but vocal band of activist homosexuals who defensively attempt to prove that they are notsick, and would tend to discourage homosexuals from seeking much-needed treatment.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Page 2 \n APA Document Reference No. 730008Homosexuality: Proposed Change in DSM-II, 6thPrinting (2 of 3)The American Psychiatric Association \u0095 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1825 \u0095 Arlington, VA 22209Telephone: (888) 357-7924 \u0095 Fax: (703) 907-7300 \u0095 Email: apa@psych.orgWhen all of the arguments are carefully examined, a few simple statements can be made with which hardly anyonecan disagree.1. Homosexuality refers to an interest in sexual relations or contact with members of the same sex. Some expertsin our field believe that predominant or exclusive homosexuality is pathological; other experts believe it anormal variant.2. A significant proportion of homosexuals are apparently satisfied with their sexual orientation, show nosignificant signs of manifest psychopathology (other than their homosexuality, if this is considered by itselfpsychopathology), and are able to function quite effectively. These individuals may never come for treatment,or they may be seen by a psychiatrist because of external pressure (e.g., court referral, family insistence) orbecause of other problems requiring psychiatric help (e.g., depression, alcoholism).3. A significant proportion of homosexuals are quite bothered by, in conflict with, or wish to change their sexualorientation. There is debate within our profession as to why this is so. Some argue that it is an inevitable resultof the underlying conflicts that cause homosexual behavior in the first place, while others argue that it is derivedfrom a host of social and cultural pressures that have been internalized. Nonetheless, some of these individualscome voluntarily for treatment, either to be able to accept their sexual feelings towards members of the samesex, or to increase their capacity for sexual arousal by members of the opposite sex.4. Modern methods of treatment enable a significant proportion of homosexuals who wish to change their sexualorientation to do so. At the same time, homosexuals who are bothered by or in conflict with their sexualfeelings but who are either uninterested in changing, or unable to change, their sexual orientation can be helpedto accept themselves as they are and to rid themselves of self-hatred.Decisions about the labeling problem in DSM-II require an understanding of the function of a manual of mentaldisorders. Its purpose, as its name clearly implies, is to list and define mental (psychiatric) disorders. Its purpose isnot to list and describe all of the forms of human psychological functioning which are judged by the profession orsome members of the profession as less than optimal. Nor is its purpose to imply certainty about the nature ofconditions when there is not a consensus in the profession.For a mental or psychiatric condition to be considered a psychiatric disorder, it must either regularly causesubjective distress, or regularly be associated with some generalized impairment in social effectiveness orfunctioning. With the exception of homosexuality (and perhaps some of the other sexual deviations when in mildform, such as voyeurism), all of the other mental disorders in DSM-II fulfill either of these two criteria. (While onemay argue that the personality disorders are an exception, on reflection it is clear that it is inappropriate to make adiagnosis of a personality disorder merely because of the presence of certain typical personality traits which causeno subjective distress or impairment in social functioning. Clearly homosexuality, per se, does not meet therequirements for a psychiatric disorder since, as noted above, many homosexuals are quite satisfied with their sexualorientation and demonstrate no generalized impairment in social effectiveness or functioning.The only way that homosexuality could therefore be considered a psychiatric disorder would be the criteria of failureto function heterosexually, which is considered optimal in our society and by many members of our profession.However, if failure to function optimally in some important area of life as judged by either society or the professionis sufficient to indicate the presence of a psychiatric disorder, then we will have to add to our nomenclature thefollowing conditions: celibacy (failure to function optimally sexually), revolutionary behavior (irrational defiance ofsocial norms), religious fanaticism (dogmatic and rigid adherence to religious doctrine), racism (irrational hatred ofcertain groups), vegetarianism (unnatural avoidance of carnivorous behavior), and male chauvinism (irrational beliefin the inferiority of women).If homosexuality per se does not meet the criteria for a psychiatric disorder, what is it? Descriptively, it is one formof sexual behavior. Our profession need not now agree on its origin, significance, and value for human happinesswhen we acknowledge that by itself it does not meet the requirements for a psychiatric disorder. Similarly, by nolonger listing it as a psychiatric disorder we are not saying that it is \"normal\" or as valuable as heterosexuality.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Page 3 \n APA Document Reference No. 730008Homosexuality: Proposed Change in DSM-II, 6thPrinting (3 of 3)The American Psychiatric Association \u0095 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1825 \u0095 Arlington, VA 22209Telephone: (888) 357-7924 \u0095 Fax: (703) 907-7300 \u0095 Email: apa@psych.orgHaving suggested that homosexuality per se is not a psychiatric disorder, what about those homosexuals who aretroubled by or dissatisfied with their homosexual feelings or behavior? These individuals have a psychiatriccondition by the criterion of subjective distress, whether or not they seek professional help. It is proposed that thiscondition be given a new diagnostic category defined as follows: \"Sexual orientation disturbance.\" \"This is forindividuals whose sexual interests are directed primarily toward people of the same sex and who are either botheredby, in conflict with, or wish to change their sexual orientation. This diagnostic category is distinguished fromhomosexuality, which by itself does not constitute a psychiatric disorder. Homosexuality per se is a form of sexualbehavior and, with other forms of sexual behavior which are not by themselves psychiatric disorders, are not listedin this nomenclature.\"It is further proposed that this category replace, in subsequent printings of DSM-II, the currently undefined categoryHomosexuality, and that for purposes of continuity and since Sexual orientation disturbance is a subset of thecategory of Homosexuality, it uses the same code number, 302.0. As is customary for other diagnostic ICD termsnot to be used in this country, the term homosexuality will appear following the American term, Sexual orientationdisturbance, in brackets [Homosexuality].What will be the effect of carrying out such a proposal? No doubt, homosexual activist groups will claim thatpsychiatry has at last recognized that homosexuality is as \"normal\" as heterosexuality. They will be wrong. Inremoving homosexuality per se from the nomenclature we are only recognizing that by itself homosexuality doesnot meet the criteria for being considered a psychiatric disorder. We will in no way be aligning ourselves with anyparticular viewpoint regarding the etiology or desirability of homosexual behavior.By creating a new category, Sexual orientation disturbance, we will be applying a label only those homosexuals whoare in some way bothered by their sexual orientation, some of whom may come to us for help. We will no longerinsist on a label of sickness for individuals who insist that they are well and who demonstrate no generalizedimpairment in social effectiveness. We will thus help to answer the charge of some members of own profession,who claim that mental illness is a myth and that by labeling individuals we are merely acting as agents of socialcontrol. Furthermore, we will be removing one of the justifications for the denial of civil rights to individuals whoseonly crime is that their sexual orientation is to members of the same sex. In the past, homosexuals have been deniedcivil rights in many areas of life on the ground that because they suffer from a \"mental illness\" the burden of proof ison them to demonstrate their competence, reliability or mental stability. (By linking the removal of homosexualityfrom the diagnostic nomenclature with an affirmation of the civil rights of homosexuals, no implication is intendedjustifying the irrational denial of civil rights to individuals who do suffer from true psychiatric disorders.)This revision in the nomenclature provides the possibility of finding a homosexual to be free of psychiatric disorder,and provides a means to diagnose a mental disorder whose central feature is conflict about homosexual behavior.Therefore, this change should in no way interfere with or embarrass those dedicated psychiatrists andpsychoanalysts who have devoted themselves to understanding and treating those homosexuals who have beenunhappy with their lot. They, and others in our field, will continue to try to help homosexuals who suffer from whatwe can now refer to as Sexual orientation disturbance, helping the patient accept or live with his current sexualorientation, or if he desires, helping him to change it.\n \n http://www.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/730008.pdf\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ah, got us there.

But if paraphilia should be handled the same way as homosexuality, why does DSM-IV devote ten pages to paraphilia and only seven words to homosexuality? Perhaps DSM-IV assumes that paraphilia is frequently impairing, even though paraphiliacs do not often present themselves clinically (DSM-IV, 523, 524). It is not empirically clear that paraphiliacs are in any worse position than homosexuals. DSM-IV acknowledges, \"Many individuals with these disorders assert that the behavior causes them no distress and that their only problem is social dysfunction as a result of the reaction of others to their behaviors\" (524), but it doesn't comment on the veracity of the defense. If there is little distress and the functional problems are due \"primarily\" to conflicts with society, it is wrong, by its own criteria, for DSM-IV to speak about \"individuals with these disorders.\" By including that phrase, DSM-IV rejects their defense: the \"many individuals\" are in denial.

An adult who engages in sexual activity with a child is performing a criminal and immoral act that never can be considered normal or socially acceptable behavior.\n \n Pedophilia is categorized in the DSM-IV as one of several paraphiliac mental disorders. The essential features of a paraphilia (sexual deviation) are recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviors that generally involve nonhuman subjects, the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or children or other nonconsenting persons.\n \n To make a DSM-IV diagnosis, the psychiatrist assesses the individual for either clinically significant distress or clinically significant impairment. Most individuals with psychiatric symptoms experience a subjective sense of distress that may include feelings such as pain, anguish, dysphoria (unpleasant mood), shame, embarrassment or guilt. However, there are numerous situations in which the individual has symptoms or exhibits behaviors that do not cause any subjective sense of distress, but nonetheless would be judged \"clinically significant\" and warrant a diagnosis of a mental disorder if they come to the attention of a psychiatrist. In such situations, this judgment is based on whether the presentation causes significant impairment in one or more areas of functioning, including social, relational, occupational and academic functioning. For example, it is well recognized that many individuals who are experiencing serious problems related to substance abuse (e.g., violent behavior, poor work or poor school performance due to alcohol or other drug use) deny that their substance abuse is causing them any distress. Such individuals would be given a diagnosis of substance dependence or substance abuse, in spite of their denial, if the psychiatrist determines that these substance-induced problems are causing significant impairment. Similarly, many individuals who act on their pedophiliac urges claim that their behavior is nonproblematic and may even claim it is \"beneficial\" to the child. Nonetheless, the DSM-IV would consider such individuals to have pedophilia because, by definition, acting on pedophiliac urges is considered to be an impairment in functioning.\n \n http://www.google.ca/search?q=cache:Uk0UtOlo-3MJ:www.psych.org/news_room/press_releases/diagnosticcriteriapedophilia.pdf+Paraphilia+APA&hl=en\n Darrel A. Regier, M.D. M.P.H., Director of American Psychiatric Association's Division of Research states, \"there are no plans or processes set up that would lead to the removal of the Paraphillias from their consideration as legitimate mental disorders.\"\n \n \nIf we read the history of the evolution of DSM-iv and it's discrepancy and lack of support it's clear that APA has polictics influencing its decsion making.\n\n \n Your opinion. \n \n \nTAlk about red herring. We're talking about marraige and you rbing up divorce. We're talking about how this will change the current institution.\n\n \n Marriage law was changed to include the right to divorce.",
