   "In the middle of a different thread a statement was made that the gospels are not treated fairly with regards to the methods used for acceptance and authentication compared to other ancient documents. It was stated that the gospels should be subject to the same degree of scrutiny as any other ancient text.\n I view the gospels as being two distinctly different types of documents,\n 1) As historical reference defined as documents used by historians to gain insights and understanding into beliefs society events and other social aspects related to the writers and period of the documents. Documents used as reference can be fake forged incomplete and still have value as reference material.\n 2) As historical evidence defined as documents used as the basis for doctrine, beliefs, moral and ethical values, whose inconclusive status effects the choices of those who lean towards being authentic as well as those who lean towards not and those who are unsure.\n The Gospels as reference material should be deemed no different than any other text from the past. \n Where the second possible use is concerned I believe with any document of this nature, that it is both reasonable and prudent that the level at which they are analyzed and authenticated be significantly higher. I believe that the degree to which a document is scrutinized is proportional to the impact that it may have on people. This type of tiered attention occurs numerous times everyday. Compare the purchase of a house to a candy bar. A written will to an oral. What is and is not covered in your health or auto insurance to that of the ticket at a parking garage. \n Secondly, to validate or authenticate that the Gospel writers believed what they wrote and/or what they wrote was the truth and is therefore proof of the existence of God and his active role in our lives are very different things.",
