   "\n same too with the unborn child, the brain is already there although it has not yet developed, he has a brain, but it is only a potential brain based on the fact the child is unbale to use what he already has.... every biologist will tell you that every human bieng is a complete human being from Conception, everything is there already perhaps not in the way we normally associate a brain but there none the less... it just needs to develop into a something the child can use.\n \n We are billionaires, the money is already there, it just needs time to develop so we can use it.... would you say it was a crime for the bank to take that money off you before it cleared and said it was their right to do so based on the fact the Check wasnt cleared at the time they took it?\n \n\n This analogy doesn't work either since, in the early fetus, the brain is NOT 'already there just not being used yet'. For a newly fertilized egg and for some time afterward, there is nothing one can point to as being the beginnings of a brain, and a developing brain doesn't become functional enough for thought/emotion until at least around the beginning of the third trimester. Just because the blueprints (DNA) are there for a brain, doesn't mean that the brain is there.\n \n However, the analogy does need to take into account that, in all likelyhood, if the newly fertilized egg is left alone, it will become a person (in the sense of having a mind as well) and that is not taken into account in my billionaire analogy. I'm finding it difficult to find just the right analogy so maybe we should skip the analogies all together.\n \n My main point is that, with the newly fertilized egg, there is no mentally existing person there yet to whom we have an obligation - it is just a rudimentary living body without a mind or mental existence. One can choose, out of hope for that future person, to oblige oneself to make the sacrifice in carrying out that pregnancy but that is a choice. I personally respect that potential enough that it would be a difficult decision but, ultimately, I respect an existing person with a mind (the mother) much more than I do a living body with the potential of becoming a person.",

   "I regard the central issue of abortion to be whether or not it is permissable to sepperate consensual sex as an act from it's reproductive function. \n \n Humans, like it or not, are socially sexual animals; to copulate for reasons other than procreation is a natural behavior in us. Recently in our history, it has become possible for us to chemically or mechanically interfere with various processes of conception in order to permit \"social sex\" to be practiced without even the low rates of fertillity-per-copulation which are typical of unaltered humans.\n \n It has been practical throughout the period of settled human history for societies to produce stabillity by rationing of sexual liscence amongst individuals. This practice insured that most males were granted sexual rights to at least one woman, thus counteracting the state where women would gravitate to a few males as their procreative partners and men would be in constant competition for this honor. This also created stable and predictable systems of family structure and inheritance. The fear of societies scorn and financial ruin in the event of an extramarital pregnancy was used to enforce compliance to this regime, and to liscence in a sense the creation of new citizens. (Humans tend towards monogamy in their uncivillised state anyway, but without coercion these lifetime pair-bonds tend to be flexible and permit limited phillandering, especially during periods of lessened fertillity on the part of the woman.)\n \n The recent advent of reliable methods of birth control has been interpreted in two very distinct ways by individuals:\n \n A ) The anti-abortion crowd takes it's cues from a traditional concept of sex as procreation. They are, in fact opposed emotionally to most forms of birthcontrol, since their answer for every condition is \"Don'y have sex if you aren't willing to make a baby.\" They are additionally incensed by abortion, because their belief in the inevitabillity of childbirth given sex makes them see even the earliest phases of conception as a child fait'accompli. It is true that in the case of late term abortions they have a fair case presenting the aborted pheatus as \"more child than tumor\". However, they vastly overestimate the regard which pregnancies and even young children were held in earlier societies, a product of wistful yearning for the past misinformed by modernities low miscarriage and infant mortality rates. The arguments used by this camp focus on the conflation of the abortive act with the destruction of something human-like; this is fairly honest when applied to late-term pheatuses, but quite a stretch when applied to a few undifferentiated cells, which they also like to call \"babies\".\n \n B ) The pro-abortion crowd is a product of a belief in the rational construction of ethics, and these people have been quick to reconsider sexual morality in the light of practical birth-control and safer surgical abortions. The existance of birth-control technologies has instilled in this portion of the population an expectation of sepperabillity between sex and chilbirth. Having seized back from traditional society the right of social sex, they are inscensed at the idea that fetillisation ought to condemn a woman to bearing a child. These people are fairly realistic about the viabillity and humanity of early term pregnancies while the dogmas of their' movement cause them to take some outlandish stands with regard to late-term pheatuses. The most notable flaw in this camps thinking is the failure to recognise the inherent negativity of the thing they are defending; there are no happy abortion stories to be told, as abortion is always a human tragedy even when it leads to the best outcome. The Pro-abortion camps arguments usually rely on a \"slippery slope\" rationale, as they are more likely to recognise that birth controll and sexual morality are the underlying issues than are their counterparts. While I would not say that this argument is \"better\" or \"truer\" than those of the anti-abortion lobby, they do address the underlying contention more directly, which I believe frames a more productive debate. In short, the \"slippery slope\" argument shows cognizance that the pressure to restrict all forms of family planning will not go away with the elimination of abortion, and tries to establih the sepperabillity of sex and childbirth as a basic right of modern persons.",

I especially like this point you made:\n \n \"The most notable flaw in this camp's [pro-abortion] thinking is the failure to recognise the inherent negativity of the thing they are defending; there are no happy abortion stories to be told, as abortion is always a human tragedy even when it leads to the best outcome.\"\n \n On a visceral level, that \"inherent negativity\" is there, I think we should be mindful of why it is. I am guilty of wanting to avoid that notion, lest I should lessen the resolve of my position.\n \n Thanks again. You have given me something to think about. Wow, what a concept!",

   "One more thing. This is another important point.\n \n \n\n The arguments used by this camp focus on the conflation of the abortive act with the destruction of something human-like; this is fairly honest when applied to late-term pheatuses, but quite a stretch when applied to a few undifferentiated cells, which they also like to call \"babies\".\n \n\n \n There are zygotes and (blastocysts...) and embryos and fetuses and babies. And these are different things. There are not easy separations between the later ones but the earlier ones are not babies. That is a sensational term that is neither accurate nor enlightening in this debate.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "I regard the central issue of abortion to be whether or not it is permissable to sepperate consensual sex as an act from it's reproductive function. \n \n ...\n \n It has been practical throughout the period of settled human history for societies to produce stabillity by rationing of sexual liscence amongst individuals. This practice insured that most males were granted sexual rights to at least one woman, thus counteracting the state where women would gravitate to a few males as their procreative partners and men would be in constant competition for this honor. This also created stable and predictable systems of family structure and inheritance. The fear of societies scorn and financial ruin in the event of an extramarital pregnancy was used to enforce compliance to this regime, and to liscence in a sense the creation of new citizens. (Humans tend towards monogamy in their uncivillised state anyway, but without coercion these lifetime pair-bonds tend to be flexible and permit limited phillandering, especially during periods of lessened fertillity on the part of the woman.)\n \n The recent advent of reliable methods of birth control has been interpreted in two very distinct ways by individuals:\n \n A ) The anti-abortion crowd takes it's cues from a traditional concept of sex as procreation. They are, in fact opposed emotionally to most forms of birthcontrol, since their answer for every condition is \"Don'y have sex if you aren't willing to make a baby.\" They are additionally incensed by abortion, because their belief in the inevitabillity of childbirth given sex makes them see even the earliest phases of conception as a child fait'accompli. \n\n This aspect of the anti-abortion arguement is one that is not often brought out since those who are pro-life would claim that this is not the reason that they are against abortion. Nonetheless, it does seem to be the main cause behind their seeming lack of sympathy for the woman who is pregnant.\n \n I would only add one point to this arguement. Namely, the great majority of people who are pro-life engage in sex within marriage where most of those sexual acts are not for the explicit purpose of procreation. It seems, then, that sex for pleasure is acceptable to them within a marriage setting. Therefore, I would say that the main thing that they find morally offensive is sex for pleasure by unmarried women.",
