   "Just a reminder ....\n \n \n \n Sorta tells it all...................\n \n \n \n Subject: To Kill an American \n \n You probably missed it in the rush of news last week, but \n there was actually a report that someone in Pakistan had published in a newspaper an offer of a reward to anyone who killed an American, any American.\n \n So an Australian dentist wrote the following to let \n everyone know what an American is, so they would know when they found \n one. (Good on ya, mate!!!!)\n \n AN AMERICAN is English, or French, or Italian, Irish, \n German, Spanish, Polish, Russian or Greek. An American may also be Canadian, Mexican, African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Australian, Iranian, Asian, or Arab, or Pakistani, or Afghan. An American may also be a Cherokee, Osage, Blackfoot, Navaho, Apache, Seminole or one of the many other tribes known as Native Americans.\n \n AN AMERICAN is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or \n Buddhist, or Muslim. In fact, there are more Muslims in America than in Afghanistan. The only difference is that in America they are free to worship as each of them chooses. An American is also free to believe in no religion. For that, he will answer only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for the government and for God.\n \n AN AMERICAN is from the most prosperous land in the history \n of the world. The root of that prosperity can be found in the Declaration of Independence, which recognizes the God given right of each person the pursuit of happiness.\n \n AN AMERICAN is generous. Americans have helped out just \n about every other nation in the world in their time of need. When Afghanistan was overrun by the Soviet army 20 years ago, Americans came with arms and supplies to enable the people to win back their country! As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other nation to the poor in Afghanistan.\n \n Americans welcome the best -- the best products, the best \n books, the best music, the best food, the best athletes. But they also welcome the least. The national symbol of America, The Statue of Liberty, welcomes your tired and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless, tempest tossed. These in fact are the people who built America. Some of them were working in the Twin Towers the morning of September 11, 2001 earning a better life for their families. I've been told that the World Trade Center victims were from at least 30 other countries, cultures, and first languages, including those that aided and abetted the terrorists.\n \n So you can try to kill an American if you must. Hitler did. \n So did General Tojo, and Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung, and every bloodthirsty tyrant in the history of the world. But, in doing so you would just be killing yourself.\n \n Because Americans are not a particular people from a \n particular place. They are the embodiment of the human spirit of freedom. Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, is an American.\n \n -- Author unknown\n \n Pass this around the World.",

   "I personally like the reference to Afghanistan. We supplied Bin Laden with the money and materials to deter Russia from conquering Afghanistan for purposes of building a pipeline through that country. The Taliban then prohibited us and our allies from building that same pipeline. We overthrew the Taliban under the guise of harboring Bin Laden after he attacked us for our oppressive ME meddling and support of Israel's similar policies, leaving Pakistan, where Bin Laden is a hero and the leader spends a majority of his time and resources evading assignation attempts, in place. After all of our pure generosity, most of Afghanistan is controlled by private armies belonging to members of the US puppet government, Afghanistan citizens are being killed in large numbers for merely possessing a voter registration card (one choice, the US puppet government), opium production is at an all time record high and international aid workers have left Afghanistan for safety reasons, they've been getting killed. \n \n I won't bother describing our humanitarian efforts in S. America, Vietnam, Iraq and other locales, but we seem to be stretching our good versus bad credibility achieved in WW11. \n \n The national symbol of America, The Statue of Liberty, welcomes your tired and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless, tempest tossed? We're currently rather negative about immigration, especially by non-English speakers, unless one happens to be bringing us money.\n \n Our WW11 military was racially segregated. Blacks attended segregated schools and were physically harassed when attempting to vote in the the US until 1964. Our national hatred currently seems to be focused at Mexicans and Muslims during our economic decline. Throw in China, India and other countries because they're producing goods at lower costs than our bloated wage and benefit levels. \n \n We're a very new world power, seemingly on our way to decline, as all world powers have done throughout history. But we certainly seem to be trying our very best to antagonize a majority of the world with our one size fits all ideology as we decline. Our friends and allies are becoming fewer and fewer even though our need for their financial support becomes increasingly critical.",
