Then is seemed to be a very appropriate defense in their eyes. :) ) \n \n If you happened not know of Tiffen's law, because you are from another part of the state, you got a gun shoved into your neck, and put down on the ground face down with several police pointing their weapons at you because they Believe that You are a scum bag. Of course such an unjust law also fell before the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n \n Are you aware of how many laws one needs to learn before on can get the license to carry.

   " Sinjin, have you ever considered the problem of murky, misinformed, not to mention willfully ignorant, understanding?\n \n It seems to be something that one encounters a lot in these here precincts. \n\n \n Simone, I understand you claim this is a problem. But your complaint is like the person who is too lazy to go out and vote who nevertheless feels justified in complaining about what his representatives are doing. To both them and to you I say get up then and do something about it. Simone, you must be willing to put forth some effort if you want me to take your complaints seriously. Your threads are like a beach ball that keeps getting knocked out into water that&#8217;s over your head&#8212;and you refuse to swim out and retrieve them. This is why your threads keep getting hijacked like this. So why don&#8217;t you take off the water wings of raw emotion and sarcasm for a moment and join us in the deep end of the pool with some actual facts. Please, this is your thread&#8212;come on out and join us. I promise I won&#8217;t try to hold you under.\n \n Now, while I wait for you, let me talk to those who have already passed the swim test&#8230;.\n \n I do not believe that any right in our Bill of Rights is absolute. I have never made that claim about the RKBA, and I will never make the claim for the 8th. Amendment right to bail. The 8th. Amendment language in question uses qualifying language &#8220;Excessive bail shall not be required&#8221; much the same way that the 4th. Amendment uses the qualifying language &#8220;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures&#8230;.&#8221; \n \n Oh, and by the way, there is that &#8220;right of the people&#8221; language showing up again, just like in the 1st. and 2nd. Amendments. For all those &#8220;2nd. Amendment only guarantees a collective right&#8221; fans out there, let me ask this: What is the source of the magic that takes the individual right phrase &#8220;the right of the people&#8221; in the 1st. Amendment, then transforms it into a collective right in the 2nd. Amendment, and then morphs it back into an individual right in the 4th. Amendment?\n \n But back to the right to bail&#8212;it is not absolute. \n \n \n Walk me through the \"Constitutionally acceptable due process\" part of remand. The prosecutor tells the judge that this guy is dangerous and the judge agrees or disagrees. Is there more? \n\n \n Sinjin, here is a case that I think answers your question. The case dealt with the federal law mentioned in the Lawyers.com article you cited earlier. Incidentally, Virginia (and I suspect many other states) modeled its bail laws to operate similarly after this case was decided. \n \n First, here are the facts as SCOTUS recites them:\n \n The Bail Reform Act of 1984 (Act) requires courts to detain prior to trial arrestees charged with certain serious felonies if the Government demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence after an adversary hearing that no release conditions &#8220;will reasonably assure . . . the safety of any other person and the community.&#8221; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e) (1982 ed., Supp. III). The Act provides arrestees with a number of procedural rights at the detention hearing, including the right to request counsel, to testify, to present witnesses, to proffer evidence, and to cross-examine other witnesses. The Act also specifies the factors to be considered in making the detention decision, including the nature and seriousness of the charges, the substantiality of the Government's evidence, the arrestee's background and characteristics, and the nature and seriousness of the danger posed by his release. Under the Act, a decision to detain must be supported by written findings of fact and a statement of reasons, and is immediately reviewable. After a hearing under the Act, the District Court ordered the detention of respondents, who had been charged with 35 acts of racketeering activity. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \u00a7 3142(e)'s authorization of pretrial detention on the ground of future dangerousness is facially unconstitutional as violative of the Fifth Amendment's substantive due process guarantee.\n \n In this case, the defendants argued that the 8th Amendment guaranteed them a right to be free on bail pending trial. As you can see the 2nd. Circuit Court of Appeals essentially agreed and held the law to be unconstitutional. SCOTUS disagreed and held the law to be constitutional. An important factor for SCOTUS was the framework of procedural safeguards that were given to the suspect when the decision is made to grant or deny bail. SCOTUS also ruled that the governmental interest in denying bail for some persons can go beyond just flight to avoid prosecution but can also include consideration of the danger the person poses to society if not held until trial. Here is the portion of the ruling which I believe sets forth the reasoning why the right to be free on bail pending trial is not absolute and can be balanced against these &#8220;compelling&#8221; state interests: \n \n While we agree that a primary function of bail is to safeguard the courts' role in adjudicating the guilt or innocence of defendants, we reject the proposition that the Eighth Amendment categorically prohibits the government from pursuing other admittedly compelling interests through regulation of pretrial release. The above-quoted dictum in Stack v. Boyle is far too slender a reed on which to rest this argument. The Court in Stack had no occasion to consider whether the Excessive Bail Clause requires courts to admit all defendants to bail, because the statute before the Court in that case in fact allowed the defendants to be bailed. Thus, the Court had to determine only whether bail, admittedly available in that case, was excessive if set at a sum greater than that necessary to ensure the arrestees' presence at trial.\n \n The holding of Stack is illuminated by the Court's holding just four months later in Carlson v. Landon, 342 U.S. 524 (1952). In that case, remarkably similar to the present action, the detainees had been arrested and held without bail pending a determination of deportability. The Attorney General refused to release the individuals, &#8220;on the ground that there was reasonable cause to believe that [their] release would be prejudicial to the public interest and would endanger the welfare and safety of the United States.&#8221; Id., at 529 (emphasis added). The detainees brought the same challenge that respondents bring to us today: the Eighth Amendment [Page 754] required them to be admitted to bail. The Court squarely rejected this proposition:\n \n &#8220;The bail clause was lifted with slight changes from the English Bill of Rights Act. In England that clause has never been thought to accord a right to bail in all cases, but merely to provide that bail shall not be excessive in those cases where it is proper to grant bail. When this clause was carried over into our Bill of Rights, nothing was said that indicated any different concept. The Eighth Amendment has not prevented Congress from defining the classes of cases in which bail shall be allowed in this country. Thus, in criminal cases bail is not compulsory where the punishment may be death. Indeed, the very language of the Amendment fails to say all arrests must be bailable.&#8221; Id., at 545-546 (footnotes omitted).\n \n Carlson v. Landon was a civil case, and we need not decide today whether the Excessive Bail Clause speaks at all to Congress' power to define the classes of criminal arrestees who shall be admitted to bail. For even if we were to conclude that the Eighth Amendment imposes some substantive limitations on the National Legislature's powers in this area, we would still hold that the Bail Reform Act is valid. Nothing in the text of the Bail Clause limits permissible Government considerations solely to questions of flight. The only arguable substantive limitation of the Bail Clause is that the Government's proposed conditions of release or detention not be &#8220;excessive&#8221; in light of the perceived evil. Of course, to determine whether the Government's response is excessive, we must compare that response against the interest the Government seeks to protect by means of that response. Thus, when the Government has admitted that its only interest is in preventing flight, bail must be set by a court at a sum designed to ensure that goal, and no more. Stack v. Boyle, supra. We believe that when Congress has mandated detention on the basis of a compelling interest other than prevention [Page 755] of flight, as it has here, the Eighth Amendment does not require release on bail.\n \n III\n \n In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception. We hold that the provisions for pretrial detention in the Bail Reform Act of 1984 fall within that carefully limited exception. The Act authorizes the detention prior to trial of arrestees charged with serious felonies who are found after an adversary hearing to pose a threat to the safety of individuals or to the community which no condition of release can dispel. The numerous procedural safeguards detailed above must attend this adversary hearing. We are unwilling to say that this congressional determination, based as it is upon that primary concern of every government &#8212; a concern for the safety and indeed the lives of its citizens &#8212; on its face violates either the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment or the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment.\n \n United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 753-755 (1987)\n \n Justice Breyer cites this case in his dissent in Heller. He claimed it supported his proposed &#8220;interest balancing inquiry&#8221; test for weighing the RKBA against the District of Columbia&#8217;s claimed governmental interest in the DC handgun ban. I believe he was wrong to suggest that Salerno supports his newly created and proposed &#8220;whatever the judge personally thinks about the issue&#8221; test, but that is an argument for another day&#8230;. \n \n Now even where rights are expressed in absolute terms the rights have not (and should not be) viewed as absolute. It does not get any more absolute, for example, than in the 1st Amendment: \n \n &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&#8221; \n \n Yet Congress can pass a law that says offering a human sacrifice to appease the god of your choice is murder. This is because SCOTUS has ruled that none of these rights are absolute, and even where a law impacts the right directly it can still be held to be constitutional. In many instances SCOTUS uses a &#8220;strict scrutiny&#8221; test for deciding whether the challenged law violates the constitutional right. Under this test, the state must first show that a legitimate and &#8220;compelling&#8221; state interest exists for the particular infringement of the right. It must then show that the infringement is &#8220;necessary&#8221; to accomplish that compelling interest. Finally, it must show that the infringement was &#8220;narrowly&#8221; and &#8220;precisely&#8221; drawn&#8212;that is, no more restrictive than necessary to achieve the &#8220;compelling&#8221; interest.\n \n That&#8217;s all I ask for with the RKBA. I have never argued that the 2nd. Amendment RKBA is any more absolute than the right of free speech, and neither did SCOTUS in Heller. \n \n I assume that SCOTUS will incorporate the 2nd. Amendment RKBA when it decides McDonald. However, I predict (and I truly hope) that the vast majority of state laws regulating the RKBA will survive incorporation. I do not argue for special treatment for the RKBA. I only want it to get the same treatment our other fundamental rights enjoy. \n \n What say you, Simone? Are you willing to talk with me? I say discretion is not the better part of valor. You know I pick on Brady for running away from me all the time. Now let me use him as a verb. \n \n Don&#8217;t go Brady on me, Simone.\n \n ---\n \n Let the man of learning, the man of lettered leisure, beware of that XXXXX and cheap temptation to pose to himself and to others as a cynic, as the man who has outgrown emotions and beliefs, the man to whom good and evil are as one. The poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer. There are many men who feel a kind of twisted pride in cynicism; there are many who confine themselves to criticism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even attempt. There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief....A cynical habit of thought and speech, a readiness to criticize work which the critic himself never tries to perform, an intellectual aloofness which will not accept contact with life's realities - all these are marks, not as the possessor would fain to think, of superiority but of weakness. They mark the men unfit to bear their part painfully in the stern strife of living, who seek, in the affection of contempt for the achievements of others, to hide from others and from themselves in their own weakness. The role is easy; there is none easier, save only the role of the man who sneers alike at both criticism and performance. \n \n It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world. Among the free peoples who govern themselves there is but a small field of usefulness open for the men of cloistered life who shrink from contact with their fellows. Still less room is there for those who deride of slight what is done by those who actually bear the brunt of the day; nor yet for those others who always profess that they would like to take action, if only the conditions of life were not exactly what they actually are. The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be a cynic, or fop, or voluptuary. There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder. Well for these men if they succeed; well also, though not so well, if they fail, given only that they have nobly ventured, and have put forth all their heart and strength. It is war-worn Hotspur, spent with hard fighting, he of the many errors and valiant end, over whose memory we love to linger, not over the memory of the young lord who \"but for the vile guns would have been a valiant soldier.&#8212;from Theodore Roosevelt&#8217;s speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, April 23, 1910, entitled \"Citizenship in a Republic\"",

   "Thank you Bryan as always.\n \n In light of what you've posted concerning bail, what do you make of \"deny on arrest\" provisions such as those sunsetting in Colorado?\n\n \n Sinjin, \n \n Well none of the links posted so far go to the actual law, at least as far as I can see. I did goggle it and found a Colorado Bureau of Investigations webpage that tells people what to do if their firearm purchase was denied because of an old arrest on their record that did not show the final outcome of the charge: Colorado Department of Public Safety\n \n From what I can gather this looks like an instant check issue concerning the accuracy of criminal record histories maintained in Colorado. Colorado appears to use a computerized instant check background check system similar to Virginia&#8217;s, in which the purchaser has his record checked for approval while he is in the store. \n \n In Virginia the State Police run the instant check system, and they run the purchaser&#8217;s info through the national database, NCIC, and the Virginia database, called VCIN. It is the same record check information that I see every day at work, except that records I request for investigation purposes are printed out and temporarily stored in the file of the defendant the record was run on. \n \n I think I&#8217;ve got an idea of what&#8217;s going on in Colorado, but let me first explain how the record check system works. All this information is put into a state-wide database by the local jurisdiction (which shares it with the national NCIC system). Say a warrant or indictment is issued charging me with a crime. The locality is responsible for inputting that information into the database. In many cases this is done even before I am arrested if the warrant is obtained before my arrest. One purpose for this is to let any other agency in the nation who happens to pull me over and run my license know instantly that I am wanted in the local jurisdiction for the charged crime. The info will include the description of the charged crime and whether it is a felony or misdemeanor. It will list the jurisdiction and contain the date the charge was filed. It will also immediately list the outcome as &#8220;disposition not received,&#8221; which means that the local jurisdiction has not posted the outcome of the charge yet. Until the case is finished this is what an instant check computer record check operator will see if I try to buy a gun at a dealer. \n \n It is the responsibility of the local agency to report the outcome of the case once it is finished (thereby making it available for the instant check operator to see it). Once that outcome is reported the electronic criminal record for that charge will change from &#8220;disposition not received&#8221; to read (I&#8217;ll use Virginia data entries for examples) something like &#8220;guilty&#8221;, &#8220;not guilty&#8221;, &#8220;dismissed&#8221; (if, for example, it was thrown out on a technicality and not an acquittal on the merits), and &#8220;Nolle Prosequi&#8221; (where a Va. Prosecutor dropped the charge but has leave to bring it back again).\n \n Virginia has a pretty good track record of reporting these dispositions to NCIC, but I do occasionally see records that show &#8220;disposition not received&#8221; for very old charges&#8212;and that is the fault of the local jurisdiction for not reporting what happened to the case (I see it a lot with charges from other states, quite frankly). In Colorado I do not know if that end result reporting duty rests with the local law enforcement agency or (more properly) with the clerks of the court the case was finished in. \n \n This is how the information is supposed to get into the system to be checked when I go buy a gun. Now let me compare Virginia to what I can see of Colorado&#8217;s system, and use a felony charge as an example. Both states will block the sale if the instant check system shows a felony conviction. If, however, the charge still lists &#8220;disposition not received,&#8221; then the states appear to do different things. \n \n Virginia permits the sale without any further obligation on the buyer to do anything, and requires the dealer to deliver the transaction form to the State Police, which is charged with immediately researching the matter to determine whether a disqualifying conviction was not recorded properly. If the State Police find this to be so, then that agency immediately notifies the dealer and the local law enforcement agency of the problem. Virginia can do it this way without burdening the purchaser because our criminal record infrastructure is able to ensure a high degree of accuracy with Instant Check. The burden therefore rests with the state to make sure the system is accurate up front&#8212;something Virginia does very well. \n \n Colorado, on the other hand, appears to block the sale and puts the burden on the purchaser to go get the court documents from the local jurisdiction showing that the charge was ended without a conviction. The burden therefore rests with the person who wants to clear his name because a local official did not report the proper outcome of his charge. \n \n What I say from here on is based upon the above assumption of Colorado&#8217;s system. If I have misunderstood that system then I invite correction on it. But if this is the system, then I have mixed feelings about it. Remember that before Instant Check we were forced to endure an old &#8220;snail mail&#8221; background check process that used to take up to two weeks of mailing back and forth before you got an answer approving the sale. The federal &#8220;Brady Bill&#8221; Instant Check scheme was supposed to get rid of the delay, and the NRA (and I) supported it because it promised to be accurate enough to remove the delay by making accurate records instantly reviewable. After all, if the records could be accurately checked instantly then the reason for the delay in the purchase goes away&#8212;despite the ill intentions of those who wanted to continue to force weeks of delay on us. But I agree that if the records are inadequate then instant check should be abandoned in that case to make sure the person can legitimately have the gun. So in theory I don&#8217;t have a problem with Colorado&#8217;s &#8220;wait and check to make sure if the arrest does not show a disposition&#8221; process. \n \n BUT, I read in the article Sinjin cited from February 2, 2000: \n \n &#8220;No one list tracks those arrested all the way through court. Colorado officials are working on a computer program that will match arrests with what happened to the suspects in court. But that system, by its best measure, is only 35 percent effective.&#8221; (emphasis added)\n \n This to me is unacceptable, and here is why:\n \n Someone mentioned earlier in this thread that the Colorado &#8220;deny it first and make the buyer prove he was found not guilty when the system doesn&#8217;t show it&#8221; system went back to 1994. That&#8217;s probably true, for that was when the federal Brady Act was signed and Instant Check came online nationwide. I bet at that time Colorado&#8217;s criminal record history database, reporting procedures, and local reporting habits were not complete enough to handle Instant Check. That is, Colorado probably did not have the infrastructure in place to handle Instant Check and make it fully reliable in 1994 (unlike, I&#8217;m proud to say, Virginia&#8217;s system, which was ready and accurate enough). Therefore, at that time they had a justification for having a delay to make sure the records were right (although I do have a problem with placing this duty on the buyer to support the indifference, laziness, or incompetence of the state reporting system)\n \n But six years later and the system can be accurate, at best, only 35% of the time? It appears they did very little to fix the problem in the six years from 1994 to 2000. Is that the fault of the gun buyer? Should he have had to wait six years to be told &#8220;we can still only get it right 35% of the time, so we have decided to continue to make you carry our water for us if we fail to report you were acquitted of the crime&#8221;?\n \n I understand from reading further that there is supposed to be a 2010 &#8220;sunset&#8221; of this &#8220;auto-denial for an arrest that does not show a disposition&#8212;and make the buyer fix our mistake for us&#8221; law. My guess is that the legislature set this up because it planned to build up Colorado&#8217;s system to make Instant Check reliable enough within those ten years from 2000 until now&#8212;thereby taking away the need for the burdensome law. \n \n So what has been going on in Colorado for the last decade? I read with interest in Sinjin&#8217;s article that some legislators ten years ago trumpeted their defiance of the NRA and that they were proud to have kept the burden on the gun buyer to make sure the state accurately recorded his criminal record history. And now I see it appears that either they or others cut from the same cloth want to remove the sunset of that law and keep it around. So I ask again, what have they done in the last decade to fix the problem? Have they been able to get their accuracy rate over the 50% mark yet? Apparently not, since some of these legislators want to keep the same burden of fixing the problem on the buyer. So have they really done anything in ten years to fix this record history recording problem, or have they simply refused to address it because they wanted to keep it around as an excuse to continue to unduly burden the gun buyer? Did they all along intend to let the criminal records reporting problem fester because they didn&#8217;t like Instant Check in the first place and never intended to comply with it?\n \n All I can say is that in Colorado inadequate Instant Check records must still be the norm to justify a move to &#8220;un-sunset&#8221; this burdensome law and keep it around. And since these same models of legislative efficiency have decided not to &#8220;reset the sunset&#8221; it appears their true motive all along was to make the law permanent&#8212;to never fix an issue which honest people saw to be a problem but which they saw as a continued opportunity to harass otherwise innocent firearm purchasers. \n \n Would you vote for a guy who promised to fix the potholes in your city, and who six years later said we&#8217;ve only got 35% of them filled? I doubt it. And if you did, wouldn&#8217;t you at least check first to see if he owned a financial interest in a car alignment business? But say you did vote for him again, and ten more years go by in which you have to keep going out to fill in the pot holes he won&#8217;t deal with. He comes back to you and says &#8220;you know, I&#8217;ve had 16 years to get this done, but it&#8217;s still such a mess that I&#8217;ve decided to continue to make you fill in the potholes for me. Can I still count on you at the polls in November?&#8221; \n \n I know not what course others may take, but as for me, I&#8217;d say &#8220;See you later, I&#8217;m moving to Virginia.&#8221;\n \n And Simone, remember, &#8220;Virginia is for lovers&#8221;&#8212;and not just of guns. I know you stuck you toe in the water since my last post. If you find the water too chilly then fine, stay out for all I care. You can even continue to throw all the one-liner rocks you want. Your sticks and stones won&#8217;t break my bones. And if your aim is anything like your reading comprehension, then I&#8217;ll just turn my back to talk with others, tread water for a while, and watch &#8216;em sail high and wide overhead.",

   "Thank you Bryan as always.\n \n In light of what you've posted concerning bail, what do you make of \"deny on arrest\" provisions such as those sunsetting in Colorado?\n\n \n Colorado is pretty screwed up almost as bad as kalifornia.\n \n Since you are \"one of us\" now, this latest decision should cheer the cockles of your heart:\n \n David Kopel \u0095 April 15, 2010 1:17 pm \n \n Students for Concealed Carry on Campus v. Regents of the University of Colorado. Decided this morning by the Colorado Court of Appeals (a three-judge panel of Colorado's intermediate appellate court). In brief: Colorado's licensing statute for carrying a concealed handgun for lawful protection is explicitly preemptive. The University of Colorado bans concealed carry anyway, arguing that there is an implicit exception applicable to CU. The Mountain States Legal Foundation brings a suit on behalf of SCCC. The trial court dismisses for failure to state a claim. The Court of Appeals unanimously reverses the dismissal, and remands the case for further proceedings. The Court of Appeals holds that: 1. The statutory claim under the Concealed Carry Act should not have been dismissed, because there is no exemption for the University of Colorado. 2. The constitutional claim under the Colorado Constitution's right to arms provision should not have been dismissed; the proper standard of review, under Colorado case law, is \"reasonableness\", which is a higher standard than rational basis. The Court of Appeals expresses no opinion on the merits of the constitutional claim. emoticon_xhoho",

My personal opinion is that was never necessary before 1974 and brady got the Ncis process started late 1980's as I recall and Printz was decided in the early 1990's where the Court ruled it was an unfunded mandate on States and unConstitutional.\n \n We did just fine through most of my life without someone picking at a right to make a profit for their own sick cause.

Your criticism of means of defense is noted and your bias say volumes!\n People just like you scrambled for guns during kalifornia riots and were teed off that the waiting period they had foisted on others and unknowingly on themselves meant a 10 day wait.

You have no idea how many black belts I have seen get the living (edited by poster) kicked out of them in a fair fight by some local bad ***. One can only assume what would happen by design on the not so well lit street, elevator, or public square by those with bad intent.

I can point out 32 folks who attended a place called Virginia Tech. Do you believe they \"felt\" a need for any method of self defense? Not just a firearm, ANY method? I would think one would \"feel\" safe on a college campus. But, as the proof is in the pudding, \"feeling\" safe didn't tranfer to reality very well, did it? These 32 people are now dead as doornails. In the moments before their death, I'm guessing their former feeling of safety quickly turned to a feeling of unsafety. In reality, how were they prepared to deal with this feeling? As far as I can tell, they could have been high on pot for all we know. They could have felt euphoric. They could have felt sad. They could have felt lustful. They could have felt bored.\n \n Please explain: How do \"felings\" have anything to do with the actual personal condition of BEING safe or BEING in danger?\n \n \nI also have no intention of getting killed in a shootout over the contents of my pockets.\n\n \n This is a good one. Please inform me of anyone who does. Are you saying that YOUR intentions are the ones that dictate outcome? If you encounter an armed criminal who DOES intend to kill you for the contents of your pockets, and you have NO intentions of getting killed in a shootout over the contents of your pockets, who's intentions take precedence? Does the armed robber, somehow, forfeit? Once again I ask:\n \n How do your intentions have any reflection on outcome? There is a robber with a gun. He intends on using it. You are now in a gunfight. He is now shooting you so that you will lie still as he rifles through your pockets.\n \n You have stated that your intentions are for this to NOT HAPPEN.\n \n How do your intentions take precedent over his? The murderer has the MEANS to enforce his. Your intentions, however nice and friendly they are, have no MEANS to be enacted while the robber has a very effective tool to ensure his intentions trump yours.\n \n \nIf carrying a gun inclines one to take avoidable risks one wouldn't otherwise if unarmed, I think it foolhardy.\n\n \n That's a big \"if\". While I do agree that having the means of preventing assault on one's person provides a certain comfort level, therefore, a person who posesses this means might \"feel\" safer than someone who doesn't. This may potentially lead them to take risks an unarmed person wouldn't (such as walking through bad neighborhoods rather than around them). This is the \"if\". I have found that carrying a firearm has FOCUSED my attention on this. In reality, I am MORE aware of places, surroundings, and areas were the likelyhood of actually having to use my firearm is greater. THEREFORE, in reality, I find myself paying closer attention to avoiding these places that I did when I was unarmed.\n \n It's kind of a catch 22. Before arming myself, I walked indifferently through places where I would have been a whole lot safer if I would have entered them armed. Now that I've taken the training and have been licenced to carry a firearm, I find myself avoiding these places. Hence: Now that I CAN protect myself, I have less of a need to do so. \n \n Now that I have the MEANS to enforce my desire to not get killed in a shootout over the contents of my pockets, I am actually safer, not because of the firearm, but because I am more concious of my surroundings.\n \n Now, I will agree that there are probably folks out there who have the exact opposite reaction: \"Hey, I've avoided these dangerous places before because I was helpless. Now that I'm armed, I'll just walk down so-and-so street because I have the MEANS to enforce my intention to not be killed in a shootout over the contents of my pockets.\"\n \n They have the \"feeling\" of safety provided by the tool they have chosen to carry, but as I have stated above, this \"feeling\" has just as much of an effect on reality as your \"feeling\" of safety does.\n \n The only difference is, the armed individual has the MEANS of affecting the outcome. The armed person has an effective argument. Whereas,unarmed, you do not.",

If your first line fails....what's your second line?\n \n \nI'm not attempting to prove that someone armed automatically thinks this way, I suggesting some might.\n\n \n You'd probably be right far more than some. I'm quite sure many think this way. The fact that a person has a defensive weapon doesn't make them bulletproof. Having a firearm doesn't magically make one invincible. Just as you \"feel\" that you don't need a firearm, there are others who \"feel\" that a firearm is some form of talisman to prevent danger.\n \n In both cases, \"feelings\" mean exactly squat. A person with a firearm is in just as much danger as one without.

You are left with changing your feelings.\n \n My choice of dealing with the FEELING of danger will be quite different. I have more than one option. \n \n Yes, I know you also possess the ability to fight. I'm talking about effectiveness. I have the SAME TOOL that is being used against me. My effectiveness is equal to the threat. Moreso, if you'd care to take into account the extensive training and familiarity with my weapon I've developed. I practice drawing from concealment, target acquisition, tactical positioning, shooting at moving targets, shooting while moving myself, and numerous other simple defensive techniques quite regularly. Do you honestly believe he \"run of the mill\" mugger is anticipating an armed response? Or is he blindly relying on a typical reaction of....oh, let's say...SOMEONE WHO IS UNARMED?\n \n I agree with your suggestion that some might think this way. I'm even willing to offer that MANY think this way. However, I would add that nowhere have you offered any evidence that those who do would be WRONG.\n \n I'm simply suggesting that your typical criminal is fully prepared for your response. Do you even know what that will be?\n \n Do you think the typical mugger has prepared for mine as much as I have prepared for his?\n \n Who has the advantage? You, or me?\n \n Remember, we're dealing with reality, not feelings.",
