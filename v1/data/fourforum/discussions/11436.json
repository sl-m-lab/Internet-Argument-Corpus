You face a much greater threat of potential harm from that than at the hands of a criminal. Are you as adamant about eating healthy as you are about the need to have a gun?\n\n \n Why? Because being the victim of a violent crime happens enough times for it to be a genuine concern. I'd like to see your statistics to show that violent crime rarely occurs, because the statistics I've seen show that it happens quite regularly.\n \n \nThe fact is, we all constantly face the threat of potential harm every minute of every day. Risk is a part of living. I would like to know why guns specifically are needed to mitigate the risk of being the victim of a crime, when other methods (better locks, alarms, non-lethal weapons like pepper spray and tasers) can be effective.\n\n \n Because guns are the best method available on the market. Settling for second best when you could have the best is just stupid.\n \n Better locks? The best they'll do is slow down the person seeking to harm you, their effectiveness is contingent on the strength of the door they're on.\n \n Alarms? So somebody will know that you're in danger, what then? That won't get the police there any faster than dialing 911.\n \n Non-lethal weapons? Somethings non-lethal is a non-option. Brandishing a can of pepper spray won't cause an attacker to flee for their life, it won't hold them at bay until the police arrive to arrest them, it won't stop a violent individual from across the room, and it sure as hell won't affect somebody that's doped up on narcotics. \n \n And stun guns are more useless than knives, because as I've said before, you need to get right up against your attacker to use them. You have to get within stabbing distance to shock them, do you really want that to be your best option for protecting yourself? The idea is to keep the bad guy away from you, not let them get right next to you.\n \n All of these non-lethal devices, they set up the false notion that the life of a criminal intent on hurting or possibly killing you, is worth more than your own life. That belief is stupid and should be done away with. Ask any woman that's ever been raped if they feel that their attacker deserves to live more than they do.",

   "I think a more telling question would be, why the hell would you rather feel constantly threatened than feel safe?\n\n \n Because feeling safe isn't the same as being safe.\n \n The people on the airplanes of September 11th felt safe just before the terrorists took over. The Virginia Tech victims felt safe before they knew about the killer that managed to slaughter 32 innocents. Everyone involved in any major massacre has always had plenty of reason to feel safe right up until the killings took place. But the fact remains that none of them were safe. If they were safe then they wouldn't have gotten killed.\n \n Feeling safe is nothing more than a false sense of security that can be destroyed at any given moment. I'd rather not be a victim of some violent incident and mistakenly believe that it could never happen to me.\n \n I'd rather actually being safe as opposed to just feeling safe. Feeling safe is just that: just a feeling, it's not anything tangible, it's not something that will do you any good if somebody decides that you're going to be their next target.",

   "...you are not alone.\n \n Originally Posted by Omegamon_X \n \"I'd much rather feel like I'm constantly facing the threat of potential harm, rather then believe that nothing will come to pass and that I'll always be safe.\"\n \n I believe we are always facing the threat of potential harm, whether we recognize the threat or not. Believing that nothing (harmful) will come to pass and that you'll always be safe is to deny reality.\n \n You never can tell when some derranged idiot on a bus is going to stab you multiple times and remove your head...as recently happened in Canada. That shouldn't keep you from riding a bus.\n \n However, when a threat is known, there's nothing wrong with trying to remove it from the list of things that might happen to you. When sinister plans to harm innocent people are discovered, those found doing the planning should be removed from their positions in a free society and from their access to the things that would be used to harm others.\n \n I don't hesitate to walk into a crowded market for fear of a bomb going off near me. I have no fear of death as I know it will come in some way or another. I'm not anxious to get there (dead), but do know that some day I will. I believe that the more stressful I make my life in worrying about being in certain places, the sooner my body will create its own problem with a heart attack or mental breakdown.\n \n Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will laugh my XXX off.",

We got a security system after the incident with the drugged up idiot who was beat with a crowbar.

The best they'll do is slow down the person seeking to harm you, their effectiveness is contingent on the strength of the door they're on.\n\n A little over a year ago, my apartment was broken into. As I was sleeping somebody came in and stole my roommate's computer (he was out of town, luckily). A loud noise woke me up, and when the person heard me moving around from the other room, they ran. By the time I was together enough to open my bedroom door, the guy was gone. It was a bit frightening, but I am absolutely certain that the only reason the crime occurred was because I forgot to lock the door before going to bed. Who knows if it could have turned violent if I had directly encountered the guy, but the experience in no way increased my desire to own a gun. I am more careful about locking the door, though. emoticon_xgood\n The point is, locks can be effective at deterring crime.\n \n \nAlarms? So somebody will know that you're in danger, what then? That won't get the police there any faster than dialing 911.\n\n Many criminals, armed or not, are likely to be scared off by anything that will draw attention to the fact that they are committing a crime. I believe you've mentioned the fight-or-flight response in defending oneself from an attack (if it wasn't you I apologize). Well, everyone has that response. Alarms can be effective at deterring crime.\n \n \nNon-lethal weapons? Somethings non-lethal is a non-option. Brandishing a can of pepper spray won't cause an attacker to flee for their life, it won't hold them at bay until the police arrive to arrest them, it won't stop a violent individual from across the room, and it sure as hell won't affect somebody that's doped up on narcotics.\n\n Maybe somebody who's on meth or dissociatives, but not narcotics. Narcotics make you sleepy (morphine, vicodin, heroin, etc. are narcotics). So we've reduced (not eliminated) the threat of ordinary criminals and are left with those who are out of their minds on a certain class of drugs. Show me that a significant proportion of criminals are drug-crazed fiends and you might have something here. In the right situation, pepper spray can be effective at deterring crime.\n \n \nAnd stun guns are more useless than knives, because as I've said before, you need to get right up against your attacker to use them. You have to get within stabbing distance to shock them, do you really want that to be your best option for protecting yourself? The idea is to keep the bad guy away from you, not let them get right next to you.\n\n I didn't say stun gun, I said Taser, which is specifically designed to incapacitate from a distance. In some cases this could be more effective than a gun. For example, if you shoot somebody with a gun, you may not deal a lethal blow, and the attacker may actually have enough pain tolerance to keep coming at you. Tasers work by causing neuromuscular incapacitation, effectively paralyzing them in their tracks regardless of their pain threshold or strength. Tasers can be effective at deterring crime.\n Coincidentally, Tasers are not completely non-lethal. If your attacker has some underlying problem (say, heart disease) he carries a greater risk of being killed.\n \n \nAll of these non-lethal devices, they set up the false notion that the life of a criminal intent on hurting or possibly killing you, is worth more than your own life. That belief is stupid and should be done away with. Ask any woman that's ever been raped if they feel that their attacker deserves to live more than they do.\n\n I disagree. They are all effective methods of deterring crime. I will concede that guns can also be effective, but none of these is 100% effective at removing the risk. This is why I do not understand the need to own a gun, when in most cases other methods can be effective.\n \n Now to address isly ilwott:\n \nIt seems you are recalling other statements (more than is in the above quote of Omegamon_X) to pose a question regarding guns. The original quote is not specifically about guns.\n\n You're right, I am. I recently heard a radio interview with a guy (I wish I could remember his name) who was discussing how people perceive risk. He mentioned that, while people take many precautions to avoid some risks (avoiding flying, etc), they willfully accept other risks with no precautions. People still eat unhealthy diets in spite of the very real risk it poses to their health. I suppose I am curious about the bigger picture. I wanted to know how Omegamon, and others, perceive risk, and I was trying to frame that question within the topic of this sub-forum.\n \n \nYour statement:\n \n \"The fact is, we all constantly face the threat of potential harm every minute of every day. Risk is a part of living.\"\n \n is right on the money. It is not much different from what you quoted of Omegamon_X.\n\n \n The difference, and I think it is a significant difference, is that Omegamon spoke of feeling the threat of potential harm. I believe that understanding the risks that are faced every day does not require being fearful of those risks. Nor does it require being stupidly fearless. We all take reasonable steps to reduce our risk of danger every day. To me, the use of a firearm to reduce risk does not seem all that reasonable. The intent of my opening post was to find out why Omegamon and others feel differently.\n \n \n \nHeart disease cannot be forced upon you by another person; therefore, your comparison is invalid.\n\n Whether the risk comes from yourself or another person is irrelevant. The risk itself is still there. And I would say that heart disease can be forced upon you by another person, since genetics can be a factor.",

I am genuinely curious if you care as much about protecting your heart as you care about protecting yourself from criminals.\n\n \n Your downplay of the frequency of being a victim of violent crime is rather disturbing to me. The fact remains that there's still the potential for being the victim of a violent crime, so why take the chance and not be prepared? If you have a spare tire in case you get a flat, a fire extinguisher in case of a house fire, and aspirin in case of a heart attack, why not a gun in case of a meeting with a violent criminal?\n \n \nAnd seven-point harnesses are the best types of seat belts.

A lock does nothing to induce fear or doubt in an attacker, all it can do is slow them down. As said before the best lock is only as strong as the door and screws used to hold it in place, so their effectiveness is highly questionable.\n \n \nMany criminals, armed or not, are likely to be scared off by anything that will draw attention to the fact that they are committing a crime.

If your attacker has some underlying problem (say, heart disease) he carries a greater risk of being killed.\n\n \n And if you wind up killing somebody with a less-lethal device then you've got a mess of legal issues facing you. It's better to avoid such headaches.\n \n \nI disagree. They are all effective methods of deterring crime. I will concede that guns can also be effective, but none of these is 100% effective at removing the risk. This is why I do not understand the need to own a gun, when in most cases other methods can be effective.\n\n \n Because the effectiveness of other methods don't come close to that of owning a gun for personal protection.

I wanted to know how Omegamon, and others, perceive risk, and I was trying to frame that question within the topic of this sub-forum.\n\n \n I'm more concerned with the risks that's posed by dangerous individuals than I am with that of fried foods.

   "Your downplay of the frequency of being a victim of violent crime is rather disturbing to me. The fact remains that there's still the potential for being the victim of a violent crime, so why take the chance and not be prepared? If you have a spare tire in case you get a flat, a fire extinguisher in case of a house fire, and aspirin in case of a heart attack, why not a gun in case of a meeting with a violent criminal?\n\n I apologize if you interpreted what I said in that way. I am not attempting to downplay anything. I am only trying to understand why some people are less concerned with things that pose a greater risk. The things you listed (with the exception of possibly aspirin) do nothing to reduce the risks beforehand, they only solve the problem once it has begun. More on that later.\n \n \n \n \nThat's irrelevant to the discussion at hand.\n\n You said that guns were the best defense on the market against crime. I was pointing out that more protective harnesses are the best defense against being killed in a crash. My point was that \"the best\" solution may not always be the most reasonable, or even necessary.\n \n \n \n \nSo?\n\n So, had I used the lock, that crime would not have occurred, therefore the lock would have deterred the crime.\n \n \n \n \nThe definition of deter is \"To prevent or discourage from acting, as by means of fear or doubt\". A lock does nothing to induce fear or doubt in an attacker, all it can do is slow them down. As said before the best lock is only as strong as the door and screws used to hold it in place, so their effectiveness is highly questionable.\n\n See above. A lock can create doubt about the ease of entry into a residence. Many criminals move from door to door until they find one that is unlocked, rather than drawing undue attention by smashing one in.\n \n \n \n \nLike you I've also had problems with home invaders, and the alarm system didn't discourage the last one. Either he was deaf, or didn't give a damn about the commotion. Only once my shotgun came into view did he turn and flee.\n\n Fair enough. But are there other things that could have been done to prevent the invasion before it happened? I'm not trying to diminish you sense of safety or personal security, I am genuinely curious.\n \n \n \n \nYou're really splitting hairs here over the name of a drug substance.\n\n I suppose I am, but maybe knowing what drugs actually do allows me to better understand the risks posed by drug addicts.\n \n \n \nI would if such statistics were kept and available for analysis.\n\n And why do you suppose they aren't? Could it be that such an occurrence is exceptionally rare?\n \n \n \n \nThe problem is that the \"right\" situation in which this scenario can come about is extremely limited and rare.\n\n How limited? How rare? I willfully concede that pepper spray may not be as effective as other options.\n \n \n \n \nIf you're good enough to do it with one shot.\n\n I could say the same thing about a gun, if your opponent is similarly armed.\n \n \n \n \nNo they couldn't.\n\n Oh, OK then. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n \nIf somebody has a high enough threshold of pain to shrug off being shot, what's going to keep them from pulling the taser prongs out while they still have muscle control?\n\n Because electricity moves faster than a man's arm? Give me one example of this actually happening and I'll concede that it's not a ridiculous thing to consider.\n \n \n \n \nAnd if you wind up killing somebody with a less-lethal device then you've got a mess of legal issues facing you. It's better to avoid such headaches.\n\n I thought castle doctrine protected the homeowner regardless of what causes death. Otherwise, wouldn't the homeowner face a mess of legal issues if they had killed an invader by any other means? Or am I wrong about that? \n \n \n \n \nBecause the effectiveness of other methods don't come close to that of owning a gun for personal protection. If they did then the police wouldn't have guns because it would be redundant and not cost effective.\n\n Two of the things I mentioned (better locks and security systems) have an effect at preventing home invasion. Having a gun does nothing to prevent the crime, it only serves to stop it once it has begun. \n As for police, they are trained to use their guns as a last line of defense, and rely on non-/less-lethal weapons (such as pepper spray and tasers) until all other options are exhausted. Shouldn't the same be true in one's defense of their home?\n \n \n \n \nI'm more concerned with the risks that's posed by dangerous individuals than I am with that of fried foods. I can choose where and what I eat, I can determine what's best for me. You can't do that with somebody bent on hurting you.\n\n I'm still having a hard time understanding why, when fried foods are much more likely to kill you than dangerous individuals. Surely you can determine which foods are best for you, but do you always? I freely admit that I don't always, but I'm trying harder these days.\n \n \n \n \nBecause we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject. The only ones who tend to ask \"Why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself\" are the ones who've never faced such a situation and don't know what it's like to be in such a position.\n\n Frankly, I'm a bit offended that you think I'm less educated just because I haven't had a violent encounter with someone else (I assume that's what you meant). Just because it's never happened to me doesn't mean I don't think it could or that I'm not at risk.\n \n \n \n \nNot really. If you get heart disease from constantly eating bad foods and doing nothing about it then it's your own damn fault. But if you're attacked while going on a nightly walk and robbed at knifepoint, you're not the one that should receive the blame for the crime that happened.\n\n But in both situations, there are things that an individual can do to reduce the risks of bad things happening. There are also things that cannot be done in either situation to completely eliminate risk. I already mentioned that there is a genetic component to heart disease. My entire point has essentially been that human beings don't always deal with risk in entirely realistic ways.",

But are there other things that could have been done to prevent the invasion before it happened?

That doesn't do much good after the crime has already been committed. Most people don't purchase guns and sit up late at night hoping a prowler comes along so they can blow them away.

I am only trying to understand why some people are less concerned with things that pose a greater risk.\n\n \n Because violent crime and violent criminals is something that I can't control.

You can't do that with a violent criminal.\n \n \nYou said that guns were the best defense on the market against crime. I was pointing out that more protective harnesses are the best defense against being killed in a crash. My point was that \"the best\" solution may not always be the most reasonable, or even necessary.\n\n \n Alright that's a good point, I guess I can agree with that. In my case I bought a $725 AR-15 made by DPMS, because I didn't have the money to invest in a $1,500-$2,000 model by Bushmaster. It's a budget version, but I can't tell the difference as far as fit, finish and functionality goes.\n \n \nSo, had I used the lock, that crime would not have occurred, therefore the lock would have deterred the crime.\n\n \n Never heard of breaking and entering then?\n \n What's your plan if your lock fails you?\n \n \nSee above.

You are telling me there is no difference between the risk of being a crime victim (which I have very little control over) and the risk of heart disease (which I have almost complete control over)?\n\n You may have a point. But how much control do we really have over either of these? It seems like control has a lot to do with how we perceive risk. For example, a good number of people are afraid to fly but will gladly drive to a far off destination, even though flying is statistically safer.

My statement of \"guns specifically\" was mainly meant to keep the discussion focused.\n ____\n \nWhat is it exactly that leads you to believe people who are concerned about crime aren't concerned about their diet?\n\n Mainly the fact that most people aren't concerned about their diet, as evidenced by the fact that obesity is a major problem throughout the developed world and a growing problem in the developing world. Like I said, a radio interview got me thinking about perception of risk, and Omegamon's comments raised some questions related to that so I thought I'd share those questions and get some feedback. So far it's been pretty interesting.\n \n \nThen it probably isn't the best solution, if it isn't reasonable or necessary.\n\n I agree, and as I don't feel that gun ownership (personally) is reasonable or necessary, it's probably not the best solution.\n \n \nNobody is arguing that you shouldn't use locks on your door.

I'll work on finding a quote, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent SCotUS ruling, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun.

Find a greater quantity of people who are against guns and had been victimized (those who are victims of gun crime don't count).\nGo back and look at the context of Omega's quote, and then try to argue that he was exaggerating and not stating fact.\n If this was the case then my argument is not relevant, but neither is his - his being that fishbulb has an invalid opinion because (s)he has not been a victim of crime.\n \n As for your conditions on people who are against guns: Of all aggravated assault (in 2005), 21% was with a firearm. Of all robbery, 42.1% was commited with a firearm source. That's shaving back the numbers somewhat, and deliberately biasing a survey in your favour. Mind you, I never claimed the straw man you've challenged me to in the first place, so I see no need to search for a survey that probably doesn't exist and would be rejected anyway (on the grounds that it's not from a .gov website, probably)\n \n \nAnd what would make you so likely to do that assuming you had a gun?\nPeople in my workplace had been relentlessly bullying me? I don't know, I personally wouldn't chose that anyway, or own a gun in the first place.\n \n \nIf you can give me stats as to what percentage of gun owners are criminals, then, well...\nI've given you stats that illegal gun use far outweighes legal self-defence, but to give what you're asking for here is impossible, because criminals don't tend to admit to owning guns.",

   "So what you are saying is that because you have been bullied all your life, and deep down inside you want to pay them all back for what they did to you that you dont think anyone ought to have a gun. Well i was also bullied most of my younger life, till i started showing some testicular fortitude and stopped taking it. And no i was never carrying during any of my fights, although i did have a very large knife during most of the altercations and guess what, i never pulled it on anyone. What yall fail to realize is there is a big difference between a fistfight and killing a man. I have never heard of a plain old fist fight resulting in a fatality, so yes maybe i will loose the fight but at least both men walk away and neither had any fear of death. But when someone has pulled a blade on me and they tell me they are going to cut me from ear to ear your dang skippy i believe them and now i have fear for my life. Now that does not mean that if i have a gun im going to pull it and start shooting, I would let the man see that i had a gun and warn him to stop and put the knife(or gun) down. If he does not comply and persists in his actions and im left with no other options,then i fire on him.",
