That's like a Country Music singer getting booed at a Rap concert is a \"warning\" to Country Music singers that they are not popular.\n\n \n lol.. it's not about republicans being beat in a democratic primary, it's about why the republicans put them in there to begin with. Attempting to undermine the democratic process , like passing the law to force voters to show a ID, and the republicans calling voters and deliberately deceiving them , all in an attempt to slow the voters ... well it didn't work. Republicans should be warned that playing with peoples lives has consequences . \n \n \n\n Even if Republicans do get kicked out in Wisconsin at least they passed a law that clearly benefited the state and local governments.

The Ignorant Law he helped push through will be repealed and things will go back to the way they should be. Unions built the middle class, stripping them of their rights was a dumb move on the governors part. \n \n \n\n So you can get rid of the republicans but they probably did Wisconsin a great service...and the cynical side of me thinks they did it probably because they hate unions and it just ended up working out.\n\n \n I don't agree that what they did helped anyone. Clearly the majority of the people in Wisconsin did not agree to this bill. The Republicans abused their power and overstepped their authority by pushing through a law that the majority was against.. all to benefit the Corporate brass of the state of Wisconsin. But like you eluded to, they also underestimated the power of unions. \n \n So yes, this should serve as a warning to all republicans that their day of reckoning is coming. \n \n Not just in Wisconsin, but nation wide the GOP/teabag association is falling apart at the seams.

Do you know what the biggest impact of this will be? They will be able to fire bad workers. Seriously. That is the biggest impact. Prior to the passage of this if they had layoffs or cutbacks, they had to lay workers off based solely on seniority, not performance, and a worker who simply refused to do their job could take up to EIGHT YEARS to fire while they went through a lengthy review and appeals process, all the while being paid their full salary and full benefits. \n \n On the money side of things, the unions still have full negotiating power when it comes to wages.

Comparing that to the private sector is almost impossible because pension funds are as rare as hens teeth in the private sector. Comparing it to retirement funds (the private sectors basic equivalent) makes the union members look even MORE like pathetic whining leaches. On average Americans fund 88% of their retirement funds. \n \n The idea that this deal should hurt education is just plain dumb.

   "Why is it incompatable?\n\n \n Because there is no \"management\" on the other side of the table in an adversarial position. \n \n In the private sector, on one side of the table you have representatives from the union doing their best to make the best deal they can for their people. On the other side of the table you have management do the best they can to preserve the companies money.\n \n That is not the way public sector unions work. In public sector unions, you have union representatives on one side of the table, but on the other side you have an administrator who is ALSO a member of the union. So on both sides of the table you have a people with a vested interest in making a sweetheart deal for the union and NOBODY working to control costs. \n \n Those folks, ALL union members, come up with a deal and then it gets passed on to a budget committee which includes the contract in the budget. As long as the union does not go COMPLETELY off the rails, everything goes through just fine. Pretty much the only way you end up with somebody telling the unions NO is when they do go completely out of control and politicians actually get involved. \n \n Why dont politicians get involved? Because public sector unions are one of the biggest political contributors on both sides of the isles. The unions essentially pay to have the people they want to deal with elected. That is why republican tend to go after private sector unions, not public sector ones. Private sector unions tend to support democrats. Public sector ones throw tens of thousands of dollars at every candidate from both parties. \n \n Public sector unions are incompatible with the very structure and theory of unions as a whole. The entire theory behind unions is that they were to help employees receive a fair share of the profits they produce. Their entire structure is based around this concept. Public sector workers produce no profit. They have essentially replaced \"profit\" with \"revenue\", and that destroys the entire logical basis for the existence of the union.\n \n Public sector unions incompatible with even the most basic tenants of democracy. I think that F.D.R said it best in a 1937 letter to the National Federation of Federal Employees. He said:\n \n \nAll Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service. It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management. The very nature and purposes of Government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with Government employee organizations. The employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress. Accordingly, administrative officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted, by laws which establish policies, procedures, or rules in personnel matters.\n\n \n To put this in context, under the last teachers union contract in wisconsin, 100% of Wisconsin voters could have voted to fire an individual, and under the terms of the states contract with the union, they could not have done it. Rather than allowing the people...the voters....to set policy, public sector unions force the government to negotiate policy with them. \n \n It is interesting to note that FDR wrote that letter because in 1936 the National Federation of Federal Employees started pushing for collective bargaining. They assumed that since FDR had shown strong support of unions and labor rights that he would support them. Instead he cut them off at the knees, making several public addresses explaining why unions and governments were incompatible and ordered that any public worker who attempted to organize be fired on the spot.",

It simply is not there.\n \n Now, the budget that the legislators passed contained cuts that may have led to layoffs, but that is a completely unrelated issue. \n \n If we make the LOGICAL assumption, that budget cuts caused the layoffs, then what the union bill DID do was allow the 14 worse teachers to be laid off instead of just having to lay off the 14 with the least seniority. \n \n That is a policy issue, which in a democracy is ultimately to be decided by the voters, not by union representatives. \n \n \n \n \nThe same thing they relied on before, only now when their Employer decides to cut their job of lower their benefits they have to take it up the back side because their Union has been rendered powerless.. \n\n \n NO. This is actually the reason that most people I have known who have been forced to be a member of a union HATE them. The dumbest mechanic in a union shop, the one who cannot do anything right and who better mechanics are always having to clean up after, makes the SAME money as the best guy there. What they do not necessarily get is the same perks and benefits because they are not as good an employee.\n \n As far as the union \"protecting\" workers from having their jobs cut....that is absolutely idiotic anyway. Do you know how an employer decides whether to create a job or not? If having a person in that job would create profit, they will do it. If having a person in that job will not create profit, they will not. Forcing them to keep people in jobs where they are not creating profit is bad for the company, is bad for consumers, it is even bad for other workers there (because the pot of money they can negotiate against is smaller). The idea that unions are doing something GOOD by stopping job cuts that should be made is ridiculous and dangerous. \n \n \nPeople need to remember it was the Unions in this country that built our Middle class. Anyone who works a 40 hours week with overtime pay owes that to Unions. you work 8 hours days... Unions. You're guaranteed at least a Minimum wage.. Unions... Not to mention all the other benefits that most all companies offer now such as health care, pension plans, All thanks to Unions. Instead of destroying Unions we should be supporting them.\n\n \n Yes....and no. Unions provided less than half the things on your little list (health care...what a joke). \n \n In the past unions have fulfilled an important need for labor balance in this country, and in some sectors they continue to do so. Just NOT the public sector.",

The Governor also pushed through bills to change the Voting in the state to suppress voters, but the changes didn't effect the recalls. \n\n \n At this point it is difficult to tell. Originally it was all about the unions and organized labor from all over the country sent millions of dollars to Wisconsin to support the recalls. Once the new wore off and the people of Wisconsin got a chance to actually look at the impact the union thing was going to have, union support fell to the low single digits. So they started casting around for other issues to toss up there. \n \n Radical agenda? What exactly would that radical agenda be? With the exception of the union issue the rest of the budget is pretty straight arrow. Sure it is going to upset some people because there are a lot of cuts in there, but the state is bankrupt. There are not a lot of options. \n \n \n \n \nThere are many companies who provide healthcare to their employees, whether it be paid by the Employer or not. That is owed to Unions who negotiated for Health care in their own work place and pretty much created a standard for other companies to follow. The 8 hour work day is owed to Unions who fought against forced labor practices where workers were forced to work longer hours for the same pay. Vacations are a result of Union negotiations..

And the Rich fed off the poor , forced them to work long hours with no concern for the safety or well being of the employee. Unions brought an end to this.\n \n\n \n No. Unions fought like hell to stop the practice of employers providing helth care. \n \n The American tradition of employers providing health care started during WWII as a way for companies to get around federal wage caps.\n \n At the end of the war companies kept it in place because at the time health care was cheap, the cost to the companies was cheap (less than 1% of labor cost), but it provided a perceived benefit to the employee that was far greater than the cost. \n \n Unions following WWII opposed the practice and tried to have it outlawed because they said it distorted wages. They preferred a simple wage model...not this XXXX where part of the compensation was health care that the union could not take a piece of in dues. \n \n Even the claim that unions were responsible for the 8 hour work day are not exactly right. The 8 hour work day was created in 1937 with the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The thing is, the Fair Labor Standards Act only passed because the 8 hour workday was already the norm for over 90% of American workers. \n \n The 8 hour workday is attributable to Henry Ford. In 1914 there was an accident on the assembly line caused by a worker who had fallen asleep at their station. The norm prior to that time was for people to work 12-15 hours a day. Ford sat down with his managers and they decided that it would be better to run 2 shifts at 8 hours each than to run 1 long shift. The problem, of course, is that the hourly wage his people made would not cover their living expenses in only an 8 hour day, so Ford made the decision to double their pay. \n \n The move was VERY unpopular with rival companies, but in the next year Fords productivity shot through the roof and their profit margin DOUBLED. Other companies took note of this and adopted the practice with similar results. IT turns out that working people until they are dead on their feet is very bad for productivity. Who knew?\n \n Anyway, the point is that by the time unions won their great \"Victory\" in 1937, virtually all US workers were already working 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. \n \n What the FLSA DID do was lower the average income for the working class. Most americans at the time earned extra money by working saturdays. The overtime pay requirements in the FLSA made those saturdays too expensive for employers, so they stopped them, resulting in a hit to workers paychecks.\n \n Vacation time was literally an attempt to bypass unions. For most of the nations history unions fought against any kind of compensation that was not money that they could pull dues from. Vacation certainly fell within that category. \n \n This is the problem with unions as they are done in this country. They are their own business. They exist to mediate strife between employers and employees. Less strife = less need for unions, so they have a tendency to work in such a manner that increased friction between companies and the workers they \"represent\". \n \n This is a major problem with how unions in this country have evolved. 100 years ago, workers at a union factory would elect their labor representative. This was not a job that came with a 6 figure salary like today. It was an unpaid, volunteer position. Their union leadership worked right there on the factory floor with them every day. Roughly once a month, there would be a meeting between the union leadership and the management. Most places they sat down for a meal. They would discuss labor issues at the factory where they all worked. \n \n Today the way it works, the union \"leaders\" are all paid very well to be union leaders. Unions are no longer centralized around a particular factory, or even a particular industry. Once a year when it is time to negotiate a contract, somebody from the union office who has never even been in the factory they are negotiating a contract for shows up to do the negotiation. It is an INTENSELY adversarial process because the union representative is negotiating not just the workers pay, but by proxy they are negotiating the unions income. Their job is to suck as much as they possibly can out of management regardless of consequences. \n \n The union system is broken. I support 100% unions when they exist as rational entities (you still see this in many european countries). As they are in the US, where they are a business in and of themselves, I think they should be outlawed.",

By the 1830s, this had become a general demand. In 1835, workers in Philadelphia organized a general strike, led by Irish coal heavers.

We would meet once a month in our union hall, and it was open to any member of the union where we could voice concerns that would be taken up by union leaders.
