   "So the Heritage Foundation has put out there vision to fix out budget crisis. You can find it here:\n http://www.savingthedream.org/about-the-plan/plan-details/SavAmerDream.pdf\n \n It basically claims to balance the budget within a decade. \n \n I've briefly read the document since I'm rather busy these days and here are my thoughts. Keep in mind that these views might change as I learn more and that I fully accept that I might be missing key things. So take this with a grain of salt. \n \n [*]Social Security reform basically returns SS to a poverty insurance program. This gives less to rich old people and more to old people who are close to poverty. At first glance this is similar to my plan and is actually a pretty good one. Savings would be about $150 billion based upon my estimate[*]Medicare reform is similar in that it is more income based with those making a lot paying 100% of premiums. Basically it would be come a partially subsided health care insurance plan. I honestly don't think it goes far enough but, again, at first glance not a bad level of thinking. Savings would again be $150-$170 billion based upon my best first guess.[*]Changes ObamaCare by basically removing it and making everything a tax credit. No matter how you look at it this is a tax increase for the upper middle class and rich. I don't have a position on this because I didn't have time to read the details. [*]Non defense discretionary spending goes to 2008 levels. This saves about $110 billion. The details are what matters here...[*]Transportation reform...gas tax directly to states is a great idea. Worrying about Amtrak and FAA is boring and lame. The solution to Amtrak is not to end it...it's to treat it like the airlines.[*]Defense gets no cuts and we are just \"hoping\" it goes to 4% of GDP. BOOOO. If this DOES happen it saves maybe $100 billion. [*]Other random reforms which are hard to tell what the cost savings would be but a rough estimate is $200 billion. \n Total that all up and we get MAYBE $500-700 billion a year plus an extra $400-500 billion in tax revenue with an improving economy (yeah right). To me this comes up about $800 billion short of the goal. Looking at the analysis it appears we get a lot of these savings from other mandatory spending (sorry veterans) and basically halving the budgets for all non-defense discretionary spending. At first I read \"maintain 2008 levels\" as saying growing from that point but it appears it will literally stay there for a decade before it grows again. I'm not so sure that's possible.\n \n Anyway, the idea of the plan was to balance the budget without raising taxes. While the first glance shows numerous good ideas there are tax increases (although hidden) and I doubt it is realistic in terms of cuts. To barely cut defense is silly and we need to get back to pre-WWII defense numbers...or around 2-3% of GDP. Tax increases are inevitable and should be done. Heritage prefers to mask it which is fine but do more of them if you wanna do it that way.\n \n Thoughts?",

   "Once again a Budget reduction plan that's main goal is to eliminate Social Security. They are placing all the blame on the Program and claiming it doesn't work , which is what most of Washington seems to be touting these days. Here's why I don't think it will work...\n \n From the Budget plan..\n \n The program is funded by a 12.4 percent\n payroll tax that is paid equally by both the worker\n (6.2 percent) and his or her employer (6.2 percent).\n Employers correctly see their contribution as a part\n of the employee&#8217;s total compensation.\n \n They have their numbers wrong to begin with. They must have forgot Obama lowered the Employee rate to 4 % which means the program is now taking in far less than it should be if left at the same levels. What they need to do instead of cutting is increase the revenues. A 1 or 2 % increase across the board in the FICA tax would go a long way to replacing the massive amounts of Lost revenues we are now faced with. Another thing, and you have also said this before, would be to eliminate the Cap on the wages I believe now are 106,000 dollars. Drop the Cap completely and this would also help increase revenues. \n \n Over the next 75 years, the program has promised\n to pay $7.8 trillion more in benefits than it will receive\n in payroll taxes.\n \n They could raise revenues to pay this 7.8 trillion dollars and never have to cut a single program. They could make huge gains in revenues simply by eliminating Corporate Welfare and by going back to the 2000 tax levels. Add spending cuts and we could once again see Social security Solvent without having to cut any part of the program.\n \n \n Their own words..\n \n Social Security does have a $2.5 trillion\n trust fund from the surpluses that it collected\n between 1983 and 2009&#8212;but that money isn&#8217;t\n there. Rather than build up real assets in a real\n trust fund, Congress actually spent that money\n on everything from roads to corporate welfare.\n \n This is one area I think we might agree on. We seriously need some kind of reform to the way the surpluses are used. Investing in something other than special security bonds or simply leaving the money in a interest bearing account would be better than allowing the Government to use the Surplus as a piggy bank. Both parties have blown a 2.5 trillion dollar surplus that had been projected to keep social security solvent for 70 years, now it's gone and instead of finding ways to solve the problem they simply want to eliminate the program.\n \n Their plan won't work in my opinion for many reasons, not to mention that they don't even address what they plan to do with the Disabled workers. Their plan only talks about retirees who have work at least 35 years, and paying a single flat payment upon retirement is about the worst retirement plan I have ever heard of. I agree some changes need to be made, but not drastic changes such as eliminating the program as it is now. If managed correctly the program has and will work, it has for the last 70 years.\n \n Also they mention restructuring the Defense spending but once again as per Conservative talking points they do not mention cut to defense spending. They still see the U.S. as a super power and want to keep the biggest , baddest military that taxpayers can buy. \n \n Reducing the debt and balancing the budget in only 10 years without raising taxes is impossible to even imagine. If they truly want to balance the budget for now and for the future they should be willing to put all the cards on the table but they don't, so it's hard to take them serious when they are talking from a Republican point of view alone. \n \n And last.. Obamacare.\n One of their main talking points is the repeal of Obamacare,, which to be honest is quiet confusing to begin with. The Democrats spout that Obamacare saves money, the Republicans say it costs money, the plan was originally a Republican plan now they deny having anything to do with it, but at the end of the day Around 40 million Americans now have insurance whom did not have it before. I don't fully support Obamacare because frankly being a Disabled Vet I don't need his plan. I firmly believe the only Healthcare option that will ever truly work is a full universal system like the one they use in Canada and other countries. We have such a system in place here in the States called the Veterans Healthcare system, so one would be hard pressed to convince me that it won't work for the rest of America. \n \n I didn't cover the Medicare part of it , I might read that part later.",

Personally I'd rather have our government do real things, like build an interstate system (as in we did this in the past), instead of being a large entitlement company. \n \n \nAlso they mention restructuring the Defense spending but once again as per Conservative talking points they do not mention cut to defense spending.

They don't address what they intend to do with the Disability part of Social Security, only mentioning that a person must have worked at least 35 years in order to qualify. I suppose they intend to let the millions of Disabled Americans fend for themselves. \n \n \n\n Well isnt' that nice. You are kind of wishing for the past. That \"surplus\" is nothing more than IOUs from the general government now. Good luck investing in something else...and if you did than that would immediately become a 2.5 trillion liability to the federal government.\n \n \n It already is a 2.5 trillion dollar liability. Like you said those are basically IOU's which now the Government does not have the money to pay for because they have emptied the piggy bank on senseless spending sprees, and a huge part of that spending is Corporate Welfare.\n \n \n\n So making it so middle class and poor get the same benefits without a tax increase while cutting it for those making over $110k is cutting it for poor and middle class people? I'm not buying that. \n\n \n I never said without a tax increase. I specifically said an increase is needed, and I don't think a 1 or 2 % increase to Middle Class workers is asking too much from the Middle Class. This Proposal doesn't do that though, sure they say it but they can't seriously think that doing any of this without increasing taxes is a feasible Idea. \n \n \n\n Odd that you want to increase poor and middle class peoples taxes by 1-2% at a huge benefit to the rich as opposed to the plan mentioned here which basically hurts the rich.\n \n \n Again you misunderstand my point. A 1 or 2 % increase doesn't benefit the Rich any more than it helps the Middle Class and Poor. This increase would also come with dropping the Wage Cap limit which would hurt the rich. it would also coincide with putting an end to the Bush tax cuts and ending Corporate Welfare Subsidies to Billion dollar Corporations. The Government if they had half the balls it would take to do so could eliminate our debt simply by increasing revenues and cutting out ignorant spending on things we don't need. And they could do this without ever having to touch Entitlements, although that doesn't mean some things don't need to be changed for the future.\n \n \n\n Ok, they mention defense going from 4.7% of GDP to 4% of GDP. That's a $100 billion drop or so.\n\n \n Speculation. They say approximately, which means they aren't even sure themselves. It sounded good so they wrote it down. It's things like this that concern me more than the number though...\n \n from page 31 of the proposal..\n \n \"Ultimately, of course, defense spending will have\n to be whatever it takes to protect America and its\n interests around the globe.\"\n \n An open door spending policy, how great does that sound. They have no intention of actually cutting Defense spending. \n \n \n\n I don't see how taking SS and Medicare back to their original purpose is a bad thing but in short you want to accomplish this by tax increases. I'm not convinced tax increases to keep monster entitlement programs is the best use of money. \n \n \n Actually I said Tax increases as well as some reform. I'm not totally against some cuts if it will help, but I tend to support Obamas view on the subject and would only agree to cuts in the delivery side and not the benefit side. I think the Middle class and Poor have suffered enough over the last 11 years it's time to shift some of this burden back to the Billion dollar corporations and the Rich who have had a free ride for far too long.\n \n \n\n 40 million Americans \"now have insurance\". This just isn't true. In fact, how could it be when the provisions for mandatory insurance aren't in effect yet.\n\n \n Ok I got that wrong, my bad. I was thinking of the end game where they claim that when it is in full effect 34 million Americans will have insurance whom didn't have it before. I did read one report today that said that 600,000 people signed up for insurance in fiscal year 2011.. that's 600,000 that previously could not get insurance. The one part of the plan that is working now is the part that allows young adults to stay on their parents insurance until they are 26. There has been a large spike in Young people purchasing insurance which in effect helps drive the cost of insurance down because less people are getting sick and insurance companies are paying out less, so they lower their costs. Obamacare may or may not work and I don't agree with all of it, but I commend Obama for getting it passed after Years of failed promises to get some kind of Healthcare for Americans. It's way better than what previous administrations offered.",

Good thing this plan isn't that either. \n \n \nI never said without a tax increase.

This Proposal doesn't do that though, sure they say it but they can't seriously think that doing any of this without increasing taxes is a feasible Idea. \nYou misunderstand me. I'm saying the plan proposed by Heritage doesn't hurt middle class and poor seniors, it really hurts rich seniors. Your plan actually hurts middle class and poor by taxing them more. Heritage may not have all the details worked out but the idea of going back to a welfare program is a lot better than our current program. Now, I'm all for higher taxes but you're squeezing blood out of a turnip if you plan to get it from the middle class and poor. \n \n \nAgain you misunderstand my point. A 1 or 2 % increase doesn't benefit the Rich any more than it helps the Middle Class and Poor. \nYes, paying 2% more in taxes versus paying the same with a higher end benefit seems great for the poor! You want to know one reason our tax structure is more flat than it was in the 1960s? It's because a 14% SS tax is regressive. You want to add to that. \n \n \nThis increase would also come with dropping the Wage Cap limit which would hurt the rich. it would also coincide with putting an end to the Bush tax cuts and ending Corporate Welfare Subsidies to Billion dollar Corporations. \ndropping the wage cap limit would increase the benefit for the rich. You'd have to drop the wage cap and cap benefits at a certain amount to achieve your goal. Effectively this is a tax increase for businesses and rich (especially partnerships and small non-corporate businesses) to both continue payments for the rich, middle class, and poor. The alternative presented is the same tax rate with reduced benefit for the poor and increased or same benefit for middle class and poor. Why you have such a hard on for helping the rich is beyond me but have at it. \n \n You sneak in a \"bush tax cuts and corporate welfare\" jab. This doesn't relate to Social Security at all. \n \n \nThe Government if they had half the balls it would take to do so could eliminate our debt simply by increasing revenues and cutting out ignorant spending on things we don't need. And they could do this without ever having to touch Entitlements, although that doesn't mean some things don't need to be changed for the future.\nYou keep saying this but I've proven time and time again that this is impossible unless \"things we don't need\" include everything but entitlements and 1/3rd of defense. \n \n I'm all for raising taxes but I'm not retarded enough to think we can solve our problem by doing so. The long-term goal of raising taxes should be to go back to a progressive tax structure which encourages growth as opposed to our current flat tax structure. There have been few times in our history that tax revenue has been over 18-19% of GDP. We can probably sustain going over that to pay down our debt but eventually it will go back to that 18%. More importantly is tax burden on the various classes. In the 1960s we had the rich pay a lot and the poor pay a little. Thanks, in part, to your entitlements and tax code changes we have a much flatter tax burden on folks. \n \n Anyway, why don't you list \"what we don't need\" and I'll tell you the tax rate we'd have to tax to accomplish that. Keep in mind that currently we'd have to raise taxes to 22-25% of GDP or basically double everyone's tax rate. You work on that.\n \n \nI think the Middle class and Poor have suffered enough over the last 11 years it's time to shift some of this burden back to the Billion dollar corporations and the Rich who have had a free ride for far too long.\nAnd to do so you plan to tax the middle class and poor MORE.

   "That's true. Good thing this plan isn't that either. \n \n \n Ok again I read it wrong, when they said Flat Payment I thought they meant a one time payment.. my mistake, although I still do agree with what they are wanting to do. They still do not address what they plan to do with the millions of Disabled people who did not work for 35 years or pay into social security for 35 years. They toss 35 years around so much I am assuming that anyone who had worked less than 35 years would be penalized for early retirement, and then there's the issue of the disabled and children who are also drawing social security. I suppose those people are just left to fend for themselves or the Government would need to create yet another Welfare program to cover them.\n \n \n \n You misunderstand me. I'm saying the plan proposed by Heritage doesn't hurt middle class and poor seniors, it really hurts rich seniors. Your plan actually hurts middle class and poor by taxing them more.  Heritage may not have all the details worked out but the idea of going back to a welfare program is a lot better than our current program. Now, I'm all for higher taxes but you're squeezing blood out of a turnip if you plan to get it from the middle class and poor. \n\n \n Exactly.. they don't have the details worked out so they are proposing to start a process of changing Social security when they have no Idea in reality what will become of it or if it will work or not. Sure they want to change it, because doing what is necessary to fix the current system will do far more harm to rich than the system they are trying to sell. I for one am not buying it.\n \n \n\n Yes, paying 2% more in taxes versus paying the same with a higher end benefit seems great for the poor! You want to know one reason our tax structure is more flat than it was in the 1960s? It's because a 14% SS tax is regressive. You want to add to that.\n\n \n If necessary to stabilize the current system and make it solvent again for future generations then yes, I say add to it. Like I said, they won't fix this problem without raising taxes on one class or the other, and we know the GOP is never going to allow the Rich to pay taxes so once again it must fall to the working man. \n \n \n\n dropping the wage cap limit would increase the benefit for the rich. You'd have to drop the wage cap and cap benefits at a certain amount to achieve your goal. Effectively this is a tax increase for businesses and rich (especially partnerships and small non-corporate businesses) to both continue payments for the rich, middle class, and poor. The alternative presented is the same tax rate with reduced benefit for the poor and increased or same benefit for middle class and poor. Why you have such a hard on for helping the rich is beyond me but have at it.\n \n \n Capping Benefits is a good Idea. Dropping the Wage Cap would generate more revenue. The point is there program won't work unless they raise taxes.\n \n \n\n You sneak in a \"bush tax cuts and corporate welfare\" jab. This doesn't relate to Social Security at all. \n \n \n I didn't sneak it in dude, I'm blatantly shouting that the Bush tax cuts and Corporate Welfare ARE the problem where social security is concerned. The Bush tax cuts had and are still having a direct effect on Social security. By decreasing the Revenue by billions of dollars Those tax cuts forced the Government to find Money elsewhere to pay for their spending sprees and their wars, where do you think a 2.5 trillion dollar surplus went to?.. They also blew a large part of that money doling out billion dollar checks to big oil and other corporate interests and other forms of corporate welfare. So yes, the BUSH tax cuts and corporate Welfare have a huge role to play in why social security is no longer solvent.\n \n \n\n You keep saying this but I've proven time and time again that this is impossible unless \"things we don't need\" include everything but entitlements and 1/3rd of defense. \n \n \n I'm not saying that Entitlements are off the table.. I just don't believe that entitlements are the problem. I remember just a few short years ago, when they were saying Social Security was solvent for at least the next 75 years or so. A 2.5 trillion dollar surplus was built up over those years. Bush came into office and began destroying the economy with stupidity, Obama continues the spending without hesitation, and now when Social security is in trouble and the surplus wasted, everybody and his brother wants to blame the program and destroy it. This is another thing I'm not buying.\n \n \n\n I'm all for raising taxes but I'm not retarded enough to think we can solve our problem by doing so. The long-term goal of raising taxes should be to go back to a progressive tax structure which encourages growth as opposed to our current flat tax structure. There have been few times in our history that tax revenue has been over 18-19% of GDP. We can probably sustain going over that to pay down our debt but eventually it will go back to that 18%. More importantly is tax burden on the various classes. In the 1960s we had the rich pay a lot and the poor pay a little. Thanks, in part, to your entitlements and tax code changes we have a much flatter tax burden on folks. \n \n \n Of course there would need to be spending cuts as well to go along with tax increases. But it can be done without completely destroying Social security. When you have Billion dollar corporations paying no taxes because of current tax law designed and implemented specifically to protect the rich then that seems to be where the problem should be fixed. I agree, our current tax structure is not working, and shifts most of the tax burden to those who can least afford it. When a man making 7 bucks an hour working at McDonald's pays less taxes than a billionaire Corporate CEO there is a problem. The even bigger problem is that politicians are bought and paid for by those CEO's so the burden will most likely stay where it is now. \n \n \n\n Anyway, why don't you list \"what we don't need\" and I'll tell you the tax rate we'd have to tax to accomplish that. Keep in mind that currently we'd have to raise taxes to 22-25% of GDP or basically double everyone's tax rate. You work on that.\n\n \n Ok I'll compile a list later this evening .. There's a lot we can do without. \n \n \n \n\n And to do so you plan to tax the middle class and poor MORE. Way to stick it to them!\n\n \n If the Middle class ends up paying a little more then so be it. The poor don't pay many taxes so they won't need to worry.",

For people who didn't work 35 years it would be a reduced benefit, kinda like a normal pension plan. Currently SS is a 10 year minimum. \n \n \n I'm basing what I said completely off of this proposal, I haven't read anything in it so far that addressed the Disability issue so I was unaware that it was brought up outside that document. I will agree though that the Disability portion of Social Security needs to be reformed. More strict guidelines as to who qualifies would help the program. They could also put a cap on the benefit amount based on a persons income level at the time they became disabled. Right now the benefit amount is determined by adding the total amount of Gross income a person has made and projected future earnings if that person were to continue to work. They also factor in annual raises. The system wastes billions of dollars a year because of fraud and not enough regulation. \n \n \n\n You gotta keep in mind it is a plan, not a bill.

That's why I said before if the Democrats had half the balls they should have they would hold their ground, but I know they won't and will probably cave once again where tax increases for the rich are concerned. If my guess is correct and the Democrats find some guts, the GOP will in fact agree to some Tax increases most likely by way of cutting Subsidies and/ or eliminating special privileges awarded to powerful corporations. The Debt Ceiling debate rolls on as we speak, and that is where the Democrats have the GOP by the balls, only the Democrats don't seem to realize it yet. When push comes to shove and we are facing a default on our debt you can lay money on it that the Wall Street Fat Cats will force the GOP to give the Democrats what they want.

We were already spending the surplus long before the Bush tax cuts came along.\n\n \n that 2.5 billion surplus was built between 1983 and 2000. I'm not saying Bush spent it all, I fully realize the Government has spent like crazy out of that surplus. The point is it's been spent, and because of over spending in other areas they don't have the money to pay it back. They can't borrow more from the surplus to pay anything back because the surplus is no longer a surplus. We are now paying existing benefits on a month by month basis with revenues that come in the doors. Because of the spike in unemployment and decreased revenues we are now running a deficit and probably will be until 1: we get unemployment back down to around 5 to 6 % or 2: we increase revenues to a level that will at least cover the deficit. or both. \n \n \n\n A few short years ago they were predicting this problem. I think reports showed it going until 2040 or something and now its much sooner like 2036; mostly due to the recession. Keep in mind this just means the surplus is out. They can still pay benefits at ~75% should this happen.\n\n \n History of SSA 1993-2000\n \n Here it shows that in the year 2000 they projected that in 2015 the yearly costs would exceed the tax revenues. They projected that in 2024 the trust funds' balance would peak , and they projected that in 2037 the trust funds would be completely Exhausted. \n \n Because of over spending from both parties over the last 20 years or more we are now at the 2037 projections .

Sure Clinton used the Surplus, as every president has, but the Difference is that he understood that you couldn't spend unless you had a way to pay back those debts. He had plenty of Revenue coming in as he was spending that surplus and he balanced our budget.

Even the lockbox idea wouldn't pay it all back.\n \n \nThe Bush Era Tax cut erased all Progress that we had made over Clinton's 8 years, of that there is no doubt.\nTwo wars and Medicare Part D were probably bigger long term reasons (tax cuts because of the extension) but yeah, the tax cut didn't help much.\n \n Nevertheless, we've been talking about social security here...not budget surpluses. The fact is without a social security surplus to spend Clinton would have never been able to balance the budget. \n \n \nImpossible going by today's standards. The Constitution in some areas is out dated or full of Amendments passed by Power hungry politicians who served an agenda. It needs to be changed to coincide with today's standards.\nOutdated? Doubtful. Which parts are \"outdated\"?\n \n \nbut sticking their noses into Social issues and trampling on individual rights I don't think is what they are supposed to be doing\nbut you're all for social policies. Entitlements are a \"social issues\".\n \n \nI don't care how big or small the Government is as long as it's efficient, Fair, and stays within the boundaries of what Power they are given by the constitution.\nWell, we crossed that bridge long ago. If you wanted the Federal Government to be only involved in its constitutional powers than you'd see many agencies go away. No financial aid (which I support), no dept. of transportation...or rather a much much smaller one, no entitlements other than military related. The list goes on and on.

   "And there was a HUGE \"surplus\" in SS Trust Fund when he left. About 1.4 trillion worth increase actually.\n \n \n I'm not calling you wrong but I searched, and searched, AND searched and everything I could find indicated that Bush in fact spent every dime of the Social Security Trust funds to pay for his Tax cuts and two wars he bought on credit. Anything left over from when Bush was in office was quickly spent when Obama took office. \n \n \n\n Spending the money isn't exactly the same as having a plan to pay it back. Even the lockbox idea wouldn't pay it all back.\n\n \n Maybe not a plan so to speak but at least Clinton knew that revenues would be needed to cover any money he spent. Bush didn't understand this concept.\n \n \n \n\n Two wars and Medicare Part D were probably bigger long term reasons (tax cuts because of the extension) but yeah, the tax cut didn't help much.\n\n \n The Bush Tax cuts was projected by the CBO to cost us about 1.8 trillion over ten years.. the Surplus you say Bush left in the Trust fund wouldn't pay for his tax cuts. yes, Part D and the two wars had a part in it, but the tax cuts started the ball rolling down hill in the first place. \n \n \n\n Nevertheless, we've been talking about social security here...not budget surpluses. The fact is without a social security surplus to spend Clinton would have never been able to balance the budget.\n \n \n The Surplus started under the Reagan administration , he intentionally set out to create a surplus in social security for the very purpose of creating a piggy bank. He raised Taxes to build that surplus as did Bush Sr. and Clinton. Each of those presidents also spent the Surplus to pad their numbers on the Budget Deficits, and it has since become normal procedure for our Government. When Bush Jr. came into office he had it backwards. His policy was to first stop the flow of revenues into the Surplus while at the same time Spend, Spend, Spend.. And now the surplus is gone, they want to gut the program, and I still say it's not the design of the program it's the way it was managed. \n \n \n\n Outdated? Doubtful.

Entitlements are a \"social issues\".\n\n \n Not all social policies. I'm not against policies or Programs that will help Poor people , children , or Seniors... but I am against policies that seek to deny someone of their rights or discriminate against someone based on race, sex, creed... etc...\n \n \n\n Well, we crossed that bridge long ago.

   "I'm not calling you wrong but I searched, and searched, AND searched and everything I could find indicated that Bush in fact spent every dime of the Social Security Trust funds to pay for his Tax cuts and two wars he bought on credit. Anything left over from when Bush was in office was quickly spent when Obama took office. \nSee, you say you're getting it but then you post something like this which makes me feel you aren't. Let me define a few things for you:\n \n Social Security Trust Fund yearly Surplus: The difference between SS revenue (from SS tax) and expenditures for the current fiscal year (which is Oct 1 - Sept 30 by the way). \n \n Social Security Trust Fund overall Surplus: The to-date surplus of the Social Security Trust Fund. Naturally this would increase every year you had a trust fund yearly surplus and decrease every year you had a trust fund yearly deficit. \n \n I'm going to use short hand for these two...Yearly Surplus will be the SSTF yearly surplus and Overall Surplus will be the other. \n \n the Yearly Surplus can be found here: Social Security Trust Fund operations by calendar quarter in the THIRD column titled \"Net Increase in Assets\". Granted this is by quarter but you can add the quarters up to get the yearly surplus. The LAST column is actually the OVERALL SURPLUS. A few things to note about this. One, my above definitions are not \"official\" and are just used for simplistic purposes. Two, the yearly surplus is normally measured as revenues before interest income minus expenditures. My link and my definition assume revenues with interest minus expenditures. \n \n Moving right along. \n \n In the late 90s Clinton \"balanced\" the budget. In budgeting terms this means all tax revenues equaled all on budget expenditures. So this means income tax, corporate tax, social security tax, etc COMBINED equals the expenses COMBINED. This is an awkward presentation because social security is basically it's own animal, right? So what happened was social security had a yearly surplus, like they always did, and this money was converted to t-bills, like they have to be, and spent by the federal government. In the budget it just looks like a intra-agency transfer of money. In fact, this is how it is reported on the treasuries debt schedules; as \"intra-governmental debt\". You never see it in the \"national debt\" because that's only debt held by the public. \n \n Think of this like two people with $10. One spends $8 and the other $12 and the government says the two combined have a balance budget. \n \n Fast forward to Bush. He basically is doing the same thing but after the Yearly Surplus is done he issued public debt (like Clinton did before the balanced budget) to over the extra increase in expenditures. \n \n The Social Security Trust Fund doesn't see it this way. They see it from just their fund which \"invested\" in treasuries for so many years thus creating the \"overall surplus\" in SSTF. \n \n Now, in present time we have deficits in the SSTF. This only means that social security trust fund outlays (2nd column on my link) are larger than revenue (1st column on my link). The difference is basically covered by the surplus created before. So SSTF cashes in some of those treasuries they had to purchase and pays the difference. \n \n So to say Bush spent it on tax cuts and wars isn't exactly false but doesn't show that every president has spent every dime of the yearly surplus even if you \"balanced\" the budget. We could just as easily say Clinton spent it on education or Kosovo. \n \n As for the SSTF OVERALL SURPLUS, it increased under every president. This will change with Obama...not because Obama did anything but because that's when we happen to have more expenses than revenues relating to social security. So that overall surplus will be used up by 2025 or whatever. \n \n \n \nAnd there are many agencies that need to go away.

The job of the government is not to decide how much money each \"class\" of citizens should have. We should be having a debate on what the Federal Government should do in the first place.
