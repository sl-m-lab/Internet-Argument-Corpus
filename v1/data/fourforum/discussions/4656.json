Most of the energy spent by those who are pro-life is not spent on finding ways to do that.

   "The issue of fetal pain was addressed by a working group appointed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in the United Kingdom. The panel consisted of experts in fetal development, law and bioethics. Dr. Anne McLaren headed the group. She commented: \"Fetal awareness of pain is a very emotive topic, of particular concern to pregnant women, but we have tried to approach it without preconceptions, to examine the scientific evidence dispassionately, and to identify areas where further research is urgently needed.'' 1\n \n The group determined that pain can only be felt by a fetus after nerve connections became established between two parts of its brain: the cortex and the thalamus. This happens about 26 weeks from conception. Professor Maria Fitzgerald of University College London, author of the working group's report, says that \"little sensory input\" reaches the brain of the developing fetus before 26 weeks. \"Therefore reactions to noxious stimuli cannot be interpreted as feeling or perceiving pain.\" 10\n \n They recommended that the administration of painkillers should be considered before an abortion for any fetus which is 24 or more weeks since conception. This would give a 2 week safety factor in case the date of conception is incorrectly calculated.\n \n Recent statistics show that of the 177,225 abortions performed in Britain during a recent year, only 92 (0.05%) occurred after 24 weeks.\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_pain.htm",

They argued that \"all men are created equal\" so in saying that, i guess it carried no weight and therefore why dont we just get rid of the declaration of independence?? ah, i dont quite understand this philosophy that the declaration of independence is just about King George III. Yes of course it has to say that stuff about him because we had to become INDEPENDENT from england. And it was required just as much to say that as to say \"life liberty and pursuit of happiness\".\n \n i guess what im just tryin to say is, the constituions backbone really is the declaration of independence because it was based on the belief of \"life liberty...\" you know?",

   "well i was downplaying your argument because really, pregnancy is not that demeaning to a womans body. ITS NATURAL! OBESITY ISNT!\n\n \n I never said pregnancy wasn't natural. I never said pregnancy was demeaning. I was responding to the tone of your post, which I have hi-lited below. Both of these statements minimize the impacts of pregnancy on a woman's body. \n \n [I]the child isnt even her body. It is a completely different person just being carried in another person[/I]\n \n the woman really doesnt have the right to do anything to that baby inside of her except to be a vessel  in carrying out that childs destiny to be born\n \n Yes, pregnancy is natural - it can even be wonderful, but it is also hugely physically, emotionally, and mentally impactful. Your attitude here is what bothers me most about the pro-life side. They perpetually dismiss the impacts of pregnancy and the issues of women. Why? Is it not possible for you to work for the reduction of abortion and still validate women? Why is it necesarry that YOU demean them.\n \n \nvery smart answer. I never knew men couldnt get pregnant. lol, you just made yourself look like an idiot with that statement. \n \n by the way, i was referring to those issues are pretty much symptoms of obesity. But the thing is... obesity isnt natural, the process of pregnancy is totally natural.\n\n \n OK - let's get something straight. Maybe some of the impacts of obesity and pregnancy are shared - but no, they are not the same thing at all. I have battled with my weight all my life, I have also been pregnant, so I actually do know what I am talking about. \n \n Pregnancy is a unique condition. There is nothing like it. There is the run of the mill puking, peeing, aching, fatigue, bloating, wobbling and raging hormones (that did not go back to normal for me for a full year AFTER I gave birth). There are more serious threats - such as gestational diabete that can come up. There is the actual delivery. It may demand that a woman stop using a medication that keeps her healthy, safe or sane. Pregnancy can even be life-threatening to a woman. Do not trivialize pregnancy to a woman who has been pregnant. It inspires me to want to ram a bowling ball up your XXX and to take a sledge hammer to your privates and then tell you how none of it hurts.\n \n The bottom line - the physical impacts of pregnancy are not issues men face. At all. There are no parallels to draw.\n \n \ni guess to you though, one of those people being impacted doesnt count because its just a \"blob of tissue\".\n\n \n All right. I would appreciate it if you would actually respond to what I post versus hurling random pro-life rhetoric. \n \n I have never, ever posted or believed a fetus to be \"just a blob of tissue\". Secondly I want to reduce abortion. I don't agree with the pro-life's methods for getting that done.\n \n \nwell, whatever the case may be, that baby has a full function nervous system and can feel the pain whenever it is aborted. Does that not disturb you? People always tend to think \"oh the mother is going to go through pain\" BLA BLA BLA.. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BABY THAT IS BEING TORTURED TO DEATH? cmon.\n\n \n Arleady been good responses to you on the pain issue. \n \n And don't you whine about pain pal, I have actually been through went your mother did to get you here - and you are trivializing that, and her - doesn't that bother you?",

Can you agree that successful pregnancies need these big impactful things addressed? Can you acknowledge saying things like \"just a vessel\" really works against that?\n \n \nI agree with you that it is impactful in that regard.. but what isnt?? Life isnt always easy you know.\n\n \n I got pregnant in college due to a birth control miscalculation (changing birth control - I though I was covered when I wasn't). I had to fight and lie to be able to get medical care. I worked until I was six hours into labor and had no leave - was back in class two days after I gave birth. My son attended class with me when I could not get child care. I finished my degree. I later dumped an abusive husband and have since built a life for me and my son without one stitch of support from him. I am now a successful, happy woman with the coolest kid on the planet. I don't need to be lectured on life being hard, on pregnancy being hard or on parenting being hard. I know.\n \n And none of this could have happened without me, and those around me acknowledging and supporting me in my decisions and working with me to get my needs addressed. \n \n The state worker did not have to fanagle a way to get me medical care, but she did. My college profs did not have to let me take a lot of independent study or bring my son to class with me, but they did. My mom did not have to leave her job and home and come to a new state to be there for me, but she did. If these people were as inflexible as many pro-lifers seem to be on this issue, I never would have had my baby.\n \n \nAnd why do you keep addressing pregnancy like its a disease or a bad sympton? \n\n \n Why do you seem to think it's a breeze and can be taken lightly?\n \n \nif i was a woman saying this, you wouldnt be so easy to state all this stuff about \"woman go through more pain than men\" mentality. gah, give us a break for heaven's sake.\n\n \n Wanna bet? I have argued with pro-life women a-plenty. When it comes to pregnancy not only do women feel more pain than men, men feel no pain at all. It is absolutely hysterical to me that this seems to offend you. \n \n \nHow did i? i dont see anything that i said that should spark something in you to react in a \"he's demeaning woman\" attitude.\n\n \n Are you talking about my post to Sarge in the other thread? He advocates that consequences for pregnancy should only apply to women and that's just tough cookies. That is demeaning to women.\n \n \nthink about it, if i was my mom telling you this, you wouldnt be telling me i have no respect. Many women hold my point of view.. \n\n \n It's not the fact that you are pro-life I found disrespectful. It was light way you treated the physical impacts of pregnancy on women's bodies.\n \n \nAnd by the way, i didnt scream at you.\n\n \n Nobody can really scream in here anyway...\n \n \nI guess you ignored the link i posted... the core of the nervous system is in place by 2 weeks.!\n\n \n That does not mean it is developed enough to feel pain. Heck I have a friend who has a fully developed nervous system who has no feeling what so ever on the back of her hands.\n \n \nthan why dont you answer my question.. Why do you think im trivializing pregnancy if i care about the woman and the baby at the same time?\n\n \n I don't think you trivialize pregnancy. You trivialize its impacts on on women.\n \n This is common from the pro-life side. \n \n I hear again and again how most abortions occur because somebody doesn't want to be a parent, doesn't want to threaten a job or education, is afraid of repercussions from family members, or for health reasons that aren't life-threatening.\n \n Well - - all of those things are a really big deal. But instead of finding ways to address them - they are written off as \"selfish\" and only restrictions are preached. This, to me, is not caring about the woman. Quite the contrary, actually.

Only 6.1% gave reasons related to fetal or \"mother's\" health. Jitobear would have you believe that rape, incest and a thousand other factors play a significant role in the decision to have an abortion, but when all of the pro-life rhetoric is stripped away, what remains is the reasons listed above. Sad but true. \n \n here are some more statistics for you to consider:\n \n\n Abortion Statistics - U.S.\n \n * Approximately 1,370,000 abortions occur annually in the U.S. according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute. Click here to see the approximate number of abortions in the U.S. per year from 1973-1996. In 2001, 1.31 million abortions took place.\n * 88% of abortions occur during the first 6 to 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n * 60% of abortions are performed on women who already have one or more children.\n * 47% of abortions are performed on women who have already had one or more abortions.\n * 43% of women will have had at least one abortion by the time they are 45 years old. \n http://womensissues.about.com/cs/abortionstats/a/aaabortionstats.htm \n\n \n 60% of all US abortions are performed on women who are already mothers!\n 47% of women having abortions appear to use them as contraception. And a shocking 43% of all US women will have had an abortion by age 45. Certainly being poor or in danger from childbirth isn't a factor for most because 43% of the female population under 45 aren't at risk OR poor. Jitobear's assertions are, therefore, red herrings, at best. I stand by my earlier statement that the majority of women having abortions are doing so for purely selfish reasons.",

Did you know that?\n \n * 12.2% of women are too young (their parents or others object to the pregnancy.)\n \n I am on board here.

Once again - have any solutions JP?\n \n * 7.9% of women want no (more) children.\n \n This is OK, too.

Any more than war will. Or any of this world's tragedies, But you offer no solution. You don't want to help. Your solution simply keeps women controlled and powerless. Abortion can be reduced in better ways. But you won;t even acknowledge that. You don't care. I can't believe you do. You might as well tell me the sky is green and the grass is blue.\n \n You see - I am a woman who came from hard places. You disregard them. You disregard me. You have even insulted and blamed me for violence done to me. Unless a woman is part of your perfect little happy American conservative don't touch my wallet world - it's like she isn't even real to you.

   "JP - I am aware and acknowledge these stats. I just happen to see a little past them. Can you? THIS is where you trivialize. THIS is HOW. These are all valid things. We need to find ways to address them. But you don''t want to do that. Why? Why? Why do you think that if you are female that every blasted thing in the world can be dropped the second you are pregnant and nothing will ever impact her or that pregnancy? Is your vision truly this shallow?\n \n * 25.5% of women deciding to have an abortion want to postpone childbearing.\n\n Translation: It's a bad time for ME to have a baby = self-centered reason.\n \n\n This is a big black hole. Why is she post-poning? What are her reasons. Women have brains and lives - reasons exist.\n\n Her reasons are her self-interests. THAT'S her reason.\n \n\n * 21.3% of women cannot afford a baby.\n\n Translation: I can't be held responsible for my irresponsible actions because I'm poor. \n \n\n That's a pretty big deal - babies and pregnancies cost money. Got any solutions besides preaching and bans?\n\n Lots. How about abstinance for starters. Can't afford to pay, don't play.\n \n\n * 14.1% of women have a relationship issue or their partner does not want a child.\n\n Translation: I'm screwing a loser, but it feels good so I continue.\n \n\n Let me translate this for you. Frequently this includes abuse and domestic violence. Pregnant women are more likely to be victims. Did you know that?\n\n We've been down that road before. I took in a battered mother and two kids to keep her safe.\n \n\n * 12.2% of women are too young (their parents or others object to the pregnancy.)\n\n Translation: I'm mature enough to screw, but not mature enough to take responsibility for my actions. That's a copout, not a reason.\n \n\n I am on board here. Having been a girl and pregnant - girls should not be pregnant - they are neither physicially, mentally or emotionally ready for it.\n\n Actually, they're MORE physically ready than older women, but I won't argue subtlities with you. Where's the mental and emotional readiness for sex meter? If they're not ready for the consequences, then they're not ready for the action. Why isn't more done to promote abstinance?\n \n\n * 10.8% of women feel a child will disrupt their education or career.\n\n Translation: I'm way to self-absorbed to have a kid now. Me. Me. Me.\n \n\n They are right. Education and careers lead to livlihoods - which believe it or not women and their children do need. We do not survive on air. Once again - have any solutions JP?\n\n Yeah, keep your legs closed until you finish school. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n * 7.9% of women want no (more) children.\n \n\n Translation: I know how to make babies, I'm just too lazy to get my tubes tied when I'm done.\n \n\n This is OK, too. Don't have to want to be a mother - best way to reduce this is through medical care - access to birth control and sterilization.\n\n Thank you. For once, we agree.\n \n\n * 3.3% of women have an abortion due to a risk to fetal health.\n * 2.8% of women have an abortion due to a risk to maternal health.\n \n I don't think we have arguments here.\n\n That's two in a row. Better watch out, I might be swaying you over to the \"light\". ;)\n \n\n What really, really bothers me is that you don't bat an eye at controlling the lives and bodies of women against their will and without regard to their circumstances, you would enslave every pregnant woman over help her.\n I do not understand that.\n \n\n What bothers me is that you have zero regard for the life inside of the woman and accept flimsy excuses for why she should be able to take a life. THAT'S scary!\n \n\n Abortion will never be gone. Any more than war will. Or any of this world's tragedies, But you offer no solution. You don't want to help. Your solution simply keeps women controlled and powerless. Abortion can be reduced in better ways. But you won;t even acknowledge that. You don't care. I can't believe you do. You might as well tell me the sky is green and the grass is blue.\n\n Abortion certainly won't be ended if we continue to make it easier to obtain. That's for sure. You want to solve unwanted pregnancies by closing the gate after the horse has left the barn. I want to solve unwanted pregnancies by promoting abstinance, raising girls' self-esteem so that they don't think that they have to put out to have a boyfriend and I want to teach young men to respect women. Oh, I forgot, I'm not supposed to respect women IYO. That's the bottom line. If you teach young men and women to respect each others' bodies, the number of unwanted pregnancies will drop.\n \n\n You see - I am a woman who came from hard places. You disregard them. You disregard me. You have even insulted and blamed me for violence done to me. Unless a woman is part of your perfect little happy American conservative don't touch my wallet world - it's like she isn't even real to you. And if anything happens to her outside of your immediate realm of experience, you dismiss it.\n\n You aren't the only person who came from hard places. My mother was widowed with 4 teenagers at age 43. She didn't even drive, but fortunately, was an RN and worked. We survived but I certainly wasn't raised in any perfect American household. Far from it. \n As for me blaming you, I merely pointed out that your choise of partners was poor. Can you honestly tell me that you had no idea that your ex was abusive before marrying him? From experience, I know that's rarely the case. If that's so, then, that makes you, at least, a willing victim who isn't 100% blame-free. If you pick a jerk and he acts like a jerk, whose fault is it?\n \n\n You make me stronger in my convictions. You aren't winning your side here.\n\n I don't have to win anything. This is an open debate forum. My beliefs only have to matter to me. :)",

   "Translation: It's a bad time for ME to have a baby = self-centered reason.\n \n Her reasons are her self-interests. THAT'S her reason.\n\n \n Details, JP. Come on. WHY? Why not find out why and make this not a reason anymore?\n \n \nTranslation: I can't be held responsible for my irresponsible actions because I'm poor. \n\n \n If she is already pregnant - that is MOOT. I am all about teaching responsibility - absolutely bombarding people with information and access to birth control. I am totally for stopping it before it starts.\n \n But in the end - poor women will still get pregnant and will still not be able to sustain a pregnancy without resources - so what do you reccomend? Starving women forced to give birth to malnourished babies and possibly without medical care?\n \n \nLots. How about abstinance for starters. Can't afford to pay, don't play.\n\n \n See above\n \n \nTranslation: I'm screwing a loser, but it feels good so I continue.\n\n \n Or maybe he has threatened to kill her. Maybe the abuse started with the pregnancy.\n \n \nWe've been down that road before. I took in a battered mother and two kids to keep her safe.\n\n \n Goody for you. What about the others? There are thousands of them. \n \n \nTranslation: I'm mature enough to screw, but not mature enough to take responsibility for my actions. That's a copout, not a reason.\n\n \n One does not have to be mature to screw. They should be. But they don't have to be. One, however, does need maturity to handle pregnancy and most certianly to handle parenting.\n \n \nActually, they're MORE physically ready than older women, but I won't argue subtlities with you. Where's the mental and emotional readiness for sex meter? If they're not ready for the consequences, then they're not ready for the action. Why isn't more done to promote abstinance?\n\n \n Physically ready at about 17 maybe - earlier than that, no.\n \n The rest of what you say. I am with you on prevention. Let's get those girls education and birth control. Make them have real conversations with real teen mothers. \n \n I don't know of anyone who does not prefer abstinance for teens. Doesn't mean they all will be abstinant, though. And little girls aren't equipped to handle pregnancy in any way.\n \n \nTranslation: I'm way to self-absorbed to have a kid now. Me. Me. Me.\n\n \n Really. So, the fact that you have a job make you a self absorbed jerk? Or is it only women who are selfish for needing work and money?\n \n \nYeah, keep your legs closed until you finish school. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Or maybe we could help them stay in school and keep the baby. \n \n \nTranslation: I know how to make babies, I'm just too lazy to get my tubes tied when I'm done.\n\n \n Are you aware of the stats of people without medical care in this country. Know how much a tubal costs?\n \n \nWhat bothers me is that you have zero regard for the life inside of the woman and accept flimsy excuses for why she should be able to take a life. THAT'S scary!\n\n \n I would say I have MORE regard for it. I recognize that a pregnancy can not continue in a healthy way unless the mother has money, medical care, and is safe and supported. I recognize that half the babies born in this world are female and that a right to their own bodies is THE first key in teaching self-esteem and ensuring they make responsible choices. \n \n \nAbortion certainly won't be ended if we continue to make it easier to obtain. That's for sure.\n\n \n Nor will it be if you simply ban it. You instead will keep women as second class, never really owning their own lives and body, with the whole idea that they can and should make responsible choices being nothing more than window dressing. You can't say - you are free to run your life, but just in case we don't like it, we are gonna take control at these times. It's ludicrous.\n \n \nYou want to solve unwanted pregnancies by closing the gate after the horse has left the barn. I want to solve unwanted pregnancies by promoting abstinance, raising girls' self-esteem so that they don't think that they have to put out to have a boyfriend and I want to teach young men to respect women. Oh, I forgot, I'm not supposed to respect women IYO. That's the bottom line. If you teach young men and women to respect each others' bodies, the number of unwanted pregnancies will drop.\n\n \n I agree with all of this. More education. Power can be found in abstinance. Not only do girls not have to put out - they don't even have to make men the main focus of their lives. A career is OK. Not getting married by age 30 or even EVER is OK. A good man as a partner can be a wonderful thing - but it's OK to be single. So few women get that message. \n \n Respecting women has to mean more than not using them for sex. If you are going to respect women, really respect them, you have to give them the tools and freedom to make all their own choices at every moment of their life - period. \n \n \nYou aren't the only person who came from hard places. My mother was widowed with 4 teenagers at age 43. She didn't even drive, but fortunately, was an RN and worked. We survived but I certainly wasn't raised in any perfect American household. Far from it.\n\n \n Those don't really exist anyway. \n \n \nAs for me blaming you, I merely pointed out that your choise of partners was poor. Can you honestly tell me that you had no idea that your ex was abusive before marrying him? From experience, I know that's rarely the case. If that's so, then, that makes you, at least, a willing victim who isn't 100% blame-free. If you pick a jerk and he acts like a jerk, whose fault is it?\n\n \n I did nothing wrong. Despite what I may or may not have known. I did nothing wrong. Quit blaming the abused for their abuse. I married a man I loved with the hope of building a family. HE did the abusing. \n \n And you know why I left in the end? It wasn't because of the violence. It was the cage. It was not having the freedom. That killed me more than anything. That is partly why I am so staunchly pro-choice.",

   "If you place a value on life then there is no question to what you should do.\n\n \n I do place value on life and there is no question what I should do. I should support women.\n \n \n\n Legally forcing someone to have a pregnancy is better then killing millions wouldnt you say(you don't even have to think of those millions as unborns)?\n\n \n \"unborn\" is a meaningless term like \"undead\" is. It is an overly verbose term that is used as an emotional argument.\n \n Legally forcing women (for only women can be pregnant) to continue a pregnancy is far far worse than abortion is. During the time frame the vast majority of abortions are performed, the fetus has no conciousness, cannot feel pain, has no emotions, has no thought, has no choice, has no concept of choice. Yet the woman is very much conscious, feels pain, has emotions, has thoughts, and has the ability (and right) to choose. To violate her rights, to force her through a huge life-changing event that should always be chosen is both physically painful and affects a real person who can be emotionally and mentally hurt by these actions. Abortion may be wrong (I do not think so) but it can only be wrong in the abstract. There is no victim, the only pain is sympathetic. Tell me you see the difference. The woman is of paramount importance.\n \n \n\n It just seems that if someone doesn't WANT to have a baby (eventhough in most cases they made a choice to have sex) doesn't mean they have a right to take his/her life away.\n\n \n That isn't why women have the right to have an abortion.\n \n \n\n If I said you don't have any right to live I bet you would be ******...but it is the same kinda thinking.\n\n \n No, it's not.\n \n \n\n Even if the baby is feeding off of you, you made a choice to create a life and after that you don't have a right to kill it...even if it is feeding off of you.\n\n \n You have the right to not be fed upon, no matter the circumstances. There is no instance where you have the right to live directly off of my organs and life-processes.\n \n \n\n A 1 week year old baby is \"feeding\" off of you too normally. However if you don't want to you can't simply just shove it out the door...you have to take the time to give it to an adoption agency. Wouldn't this violate your same right?\n\n \n No. There is no desire to kill. There is the desire not to be fed upon, to not be forced to be pregnant. If this could be accomplished without killing the fetus, do you really think women would? Perhaps a minority would, but not the vast majority. During the pregnancy there are only 2 choices: continue or abort. After the baby is born, there are a myriad of choices open to the woman to achieve that end without harming the baby. That is the difference. There is no comparison between infantcide and abortion.\n \n \n\n It is feeding off of you (taking your time) when you don't want the baby to. Futhermore, the baby doesn't have the opition to go for adoption in the womb. If you wanted to kill it I am sure they would like to go somewhere else though.\n\n \n The \"baby\" doesn't have the option to go for adoption, you are right. Yet the woman still has the right to rid herself of it if she does not want to be involved in the life-support function she is involved in.\n \n An infant is not dependant on the woman as a fetus in the womb is. A fetus in the womb cannot be put down, cannot be taken care of by others. The woman is constantly providing every bodily process for the fetus every moment of the day. The fetus' organs and systems either do not work or do not work fully. There is no real comparison between a born baby and a fetus in the womb.\n \n \n\n I guess it boils down to a human life is more important then what someone wants to do to their body and anything living on it. I see that not valuing human life causes way to many problems as Jitobear has pointed out some of them.\n\n \n Believing women should have the right to choose does not equal not valuing human life. I personally believe women have more importance, more value, than a just concieved zygote. The way you use it has little to no meaning, it is just empty rhetoric in a shameless attempt at the moral high road.",

While our peers were buying new cars and boats and vacationing at their cottages \"up north\", we chose our children over materialism and never regretted our choice for a minute. Believe me, I know what it takes to be a \"real\" parent.\n On the other hand, I can't fathom any scenario in which even a major change in my lifestyle is worth causing the death of anyone else.

If you are hit, do the doctors and ambulance drivers take one look at you and say \"You consented to these injuries when you crossed the street. We will not treat you\"?\n \n In the example of the burglar, if you call the police when you hear the burglar stealing your stuff, do they say \"That is a consequence of your own irresponsible actions. We will not help\"?\n \n How can we hold anyone accountable if you are hit by a bus? If crossing the street implies consent to being hit, why do we punish the bus driver?",

   "Continued from an earlier discussion, separate from my post above:\n \n \nYou can't kill someone in defense of property.\n\n \n Sigma said: I'm fairly certain you can, in some states. I'll have to look it up later\n \n It does vary according to state law, but in general it falls under \"justifiable homicide\". From here: The term \"justifiable homicide\" is defined to mean the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty or the killing by a civilian of a felon during the commission of a felony.\n \n Criminal tresspass in the first degree is a felony in most cases. New York law, Arizona Law \n \n Burglary is a felony in all cases, as far as I can tell. New York law can be found in the same place as the trespass law, Arizona Law \n \n From here: \n \n \n\n Non-criminal homicides include killing in self-defense, an accidental death like a hunting accident or automobile collision without a violation of law like reckless driving, or carrying out a sentence of execution. An execution is an example of a justifiable homicide, which is an intentional killing done in accordance with legal obligation, or in circumstances where the law recognizes no wrong. Justifiable homicide may also include killings necessary to prevent a felony or to arrest a suspected felon, and killings in self-defense. In some states of the United States, one may lawfully kill in resisting the unlawful invasion of a home or real property\n\n \n Here is a more personal take on home defense:\n \n \nTo the law, your home is your castle. It is your place of last retreat. You are not required to retreat from a threat in your home. When defending your home against a burglary, authorities rarely question the use of force even deadly force\n",

The Supreme Court absolutely had the authority to rule on this case; they have original jurisdiction when there is a dispute of state law, this is explicitly stated in the Constitution under Article III. If the Court decides the State could Constutionally make the law then the law stands. If the Court decides the State law violates the Constitution then the law is struck down. In the case of Roe v Wade decided the State violated the 14th amendment when it did not have sufficient justification to remove a woman's liberty as was done in the law.\n \n This relates to the 2nd amendment in that way. If the Court decides the State is violating the Constitution by banning guns then the Court can strike down that law.\n \n \n\n I think you can't put a ban on abortion (as in court case) because it says nothing in the constitution about being allowed to do that...same goes with a ban on banning.\n\n \n The Court can prevent a law from taking effect if it feels it violates the Constitution.

However, the articles in the constitution are clearly defined in the federalist papers for anyone that has question about what the constitution meant when written and adopted by the people. \n\n \n Then let me give you a bit of background as it relates to this issue (not meant to be comprehensive as I have little time). The second amendment states: \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed\".\n \n What does this mean? Well, taking it from the framers point of view they wanted common citizens to be able to fight off our own oppressive gov't. This is separate from foriegn threats, which we have an army for. To achieve this end, common citizens need to have access to weapondry that put them on somewhat common ground as the forces our oppressive gov't would control. So, both the phrasing and the intent would allow for access by private citizens to military-grade weapondry. However, obviously having weapons such as rocket and grenade launchers, stinger surface-to-air missles and high explosives would pose an unacceptable risk to fellow citizens if one runs amok. Can you imagine if a school shooting happened with these weapons? Television helicopters would be falling out of the sky as hooligans ran around shooting them for fun (how much evidence would be left behind, do you think?) Perhaps this is a bit of an exaggeration, but you see what I mean. Therefore, the right to bear arms, despite having fairly clear language and intent, needs to be modified for the needs of our society. The power to interpret laws, even Constitutional amendments, based on the needs of society rests completely on the Supreme Court.\n \n This does not touch on the \"collective right\" interpretation.\n \n \n\n No...if they took what the framers said and applied it today then they could have never made a living constitution and they could have never come up with the death penalty for minors decision.\n\n \n Yes, because this is exactly what happened.\n \n \n\n lol really? I think I was meaning the big war time ones that are functional. That would be cool if you could.\n\n \n I believe so. I heard of a case years ago of a man who wanted one. There was some controversy... I cannot recall how it turned out.\n \n \n\n Who said it was meant to change? Society doesn't stay static...this is true...however the constitution does. This is why we have the amending process. Who decides what society thinks what \"cruel\" means? The judges? No, it was never their job to decide the moral code of the nation....this was defined in the constitution.

However they decide it, it is within their power. If they take turns shitting on a desk and make their rulings based on that, it is still within their power to do so. The ultimate defense is the ability to impeach them (the Congress also has regulatory power over their appelate jurisdiction). They are appointed to judge based on the law, but once they are in there they can judge based on whatever damn thing they please. If an \"originalist\" were appointed then decided to base his decisions on the Satanic images in his office, he can Constitutionally do this but we could also Constitutionally impeach him. The only thing that guides them is their own interpretation of the Constitution (supposedly). Even the \"originalists\". They are unaccountable and unelected, and this is by design. No, it is not their job to decide the moral code. However, they can and do take the societal sensitivities into account when they make decisions.",

Surely anybody with even an inkling of knowledge about abortions has heard the term, Partial Birth Abortion. It's also refered to as, Intact Dialation and Extraction. Actually, it is rather hard to find much medical information about it from providers of the procedure on the web and I'm fairly certain they'd rather not shed any more light than there already is on their Nazi like practice. It did find  this article  written a dozen years ago. Be sure to read the entire article please because apparently you're not familiar with this practice but you seem to support it. \n \n The article talks about it being performed in a doctor's office between weeks 20 and 26 of pregnancy. It is also performed in the 3rd trimester as I'm sure you're well aware. No doubt you'd like to obfuscate some more and continue to play the troll but you'll need to find another mark for that game. \n \n I don't intend to change your mind as it appears that for whatever reason you seem happy that our society allows for this and you are a voice out there loudly calling for it to continue.

A woman is in the throws of labor pains as she is ready to deliver her baby.

   "Hmmm, I'm sorry, I've mistaken you for somebody who was well versed on this topic.\n\n \n I am well versed in this topic :) \n \n This is the testimony of Dr. Warren Hern before the Senate:\n \n \nThe bill under consideration, S. 939, is called the \"Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act,\" but there is no such thing as a \"partial birth abortion.\" This is an operation which has never been described in the medical literature, and as far as I know, it does not exist. The bill's sponsors describe some procedures which have been performed for many generations in the case of obstetrical emergency. The operation mentioned in the Senate bill contains some elements of a procedure called an \"Intact D & E,\" or \"Intact Dilation and Evacuation\" by some physicians during the course of scientific discussions of late abortions, but I have never heard the term, \"partial birth abortion\" in these discussions\n\n and\n \nWhile about 1% of all abortions are performed after about 20 weeks of pregnancy, only about .03%, or fewer than 500, are performed after 26 weeks. The majority of these are now performed by me or one of my medical colleagues. These abortions are almost always performed for the most tragic reasons of severe fetal anomaly, genetic disorder, or immediate risk to the woman's life. They are not performed for frivolous reasons, contrary to statements by those opposed to abortion. \n \n\n \n So there is no procedure called \"partial birth abortion\". The Intact Dilation and Extraction methods account for 0.17% of abortions performed, according to a study published in the January/February Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health. This procedure can also be used in situations where the mothers health is in jeapordy, such as when the fetus' head is filled with fluid and cannot be removed by traditional means.\n \n Since we are posting biased articles, can I post a pro-choice article?\n \n \nAs the author explains, contrary to the way \"partial-birth abortion\" has been depicted in the press and on the floor of state legislatures, bans on \"partial-birth abortion\" are not limited to post-viability abortions, nor are they limited to one specific procedure. \n\n \n The very name is misleading. The fetus, pre-viability, is not \"partially birthed\" at 20 weeks gestation.\n \n \n\n The article talks about it being performed in a doctor's office between weeks 20 and 26 of pregnancy. It is also performed in the 3rd trimester as I'm sure you're well aware. No doubt you'd like to obfuscate some more and continue to play the troll but you'll need to find another mark for that game. \n\n \n Why can you not provide a medical site to link to? I'm sorry, is that unreasonable?\n \n \n\n I don't intend to change your mind as it appears that for whatever reason you seem happy that our society allows for this and you are a voice out there loudly calling for it to continue. Perhaps you're a woman who has had one or more abortions and you use this forum to try and convince yourself that you did the right thing.\n\n \n Perhaps I am. Perhaps I am not. Either way, you have not proven that this procedure exists.\n \n \n\n Speak for yourself. I can tell you that there is no way I would have ever condoned something such as that. Apparently you're not so sure of yourself and I'm not surprised to hear you say that.\n\n \n It's a philosophical exercise. If we both grew up in a society that hated jews and in a home that hated jews, statistically we would have ended up hating jews as well. I know it's hard to imagine being a different person and holding different views than you do now, but the views you hold are a consequence of the society you grow up in and the home you grow up in, as well as natural personality.

Originalists subscribe to this, I do not.\n Not really, the originalists think you go by what the constitution/amdendment says when it was adapted as this is what was voted to be in the document. That can't change as it is a legal document. The reasons I suggest the federalist papers to determine what things mean is for the same reason a law doesn't have to define every word in it. If you have a question about what a word means in a law you reference to some things the person wrote or something along that nature. Same with the constitution. If you have a question about what \"judicial power\" means...as many states did before adopting...you have it cleared up by the person that wrote it and this is what the people adopted. So when it comes to something like \"substantive due process\"..who adopted that? It was not in the constitution, and the person that wrote the 14th amendment and the people that adopted it didn't even know that existed...so how in the world can it mean that now when it is a legal document?\n \n \nThat is the limit of all judges. Tell me, if an originalist suddenly decided to not base his decisions on what the framers thought he should? What would the limits of his power be then? What would stop him from utterly destroying the Constitution, as you believe the current Judges are doing?\n \nNo, those are his/her powers. It is even titled that way normally \"the powers of the judicial\"....just like the \"powers of congress\". If an orginalist decided to base his/her decisions on his own personal beliefs and not the original adopted constitution then we get the judges we have today. The limits on the power are the fact that his powers are defined. Anything beyond that is over the limit. So what is to stop judges from destroying the constitution??? Well, it was supposed to be the constitution, however, we kinda blew that one. I think Scalia made a good point when he asked \"why didn't this happen earlier?\". \n \n \nAgreed, if you want to change it, amend it\nThen things like \"substantive due process\" and the \"right to privacy\" would have to be amended into the constitution...and maybe they should be there....instead of getting the courts to do it we are SUPPOSED to convince our citizens and pass it instead of making up stuff in the constitution that is clearly not there. The consitution doesn't spell out everything, thus we need to amend it to keep up to date.

   "They do..they have the power of the judicial.\n\n \n Agreed, they do.\n \n \n\n Not really, the originalists think you go by what the constitution/amdendment says when it was adapted as this is what was voted to be in the document.\n\n \n Right. They go by how they believe the Constitution should apply in situations. Exactly as the Judges do now. The only thing that will change is what those interpretations are.\n \n \n\n That can't change as it is a legal document.\n\n \n And yet it hasn't changed.\n \n \n\n The reasons I suggest the federalist papers to determine what things mean is for the same reason a law doesn't have to define every word in it. If you have a question about what a word means in a law you reference to some things the person wrote or something along that nature. Same with the constitution. If you have a question about what \"judicial power\" means...as many states did before adopting...you have it cleared up by the person that wrote it and this is what the people adopted.\n\n \n You haven't provided any definition that would prove the current Judges have gone beyond their powers.\n \n \n\n So when it comes to something like \"substantive due process\"..who adopted that? It was not in the constitution, and the person that wrote the 14th amendment and the people that adopted it didn't even know that existed...so how in the world can it mean that now when it is a legal document?\n\n \n It can be argued it was in the original intent of the passage, if not in the letter. Which is exactly what you are arguing. You wish orginalists to go by what the founders intended, if not what they actually wrote.\n \n \n\n No, those are his/her powers. It is even titled that way normally \"the powers of the judicial\"....just like the \"powers of congress\". If an orginalist decided to base his/her decisions on his own personal beliefs and not the original adopted constitution then we get the judges we have today.\n\n \n Ok... and what, besides his or her beliefs, would limit him from doing so? Steve, it is rapidly becoming useless to talk to you. You cry and moan about the limits of todays judges so we should get an originalist in there, but an originalist would have the exact same limits as the Judges in there now do. You simply agree with the beliefs and interpretation of the originalist.\n \n \n\n The limits on the power are the fact that his powers are defined. Anything beyond that is over the limit.\n\n \n So... what is the limit? You cannot use opinions or documents that are not binding upon the judiciary to prove the judiciary has gone beyond their powers. What limits, besides his or her beliefs, would be imposed upon the originalist that the Judges today do not have?\n \n \n\n So what is to stop judges from destroying the constitution??? Well, it was supposed to be the constitution, however, we kinda blew that one.\n\n \n So the originalist would have no limits? \n \n \n\n Then things like \"substantive due process\" and the \"right to privacy\" would have to be amended into the constitution...and maybe they should be there....instead of getting the courts to do it we are SUPPOSED to convince our citizens and pass it instead of making up stuff in the constitution that is clearly not there.\n\n \n The judiciary has this within their power. They decide how the law is applied, and this creates a precedence on how the law is applied.\n \n \n\n The consitution doesn't spell out everything, thus we need to amend it to keep up to date. HOwever, in the cases like \"death penalty for minors\", abortion, and many other key issues...those were around during the written of the constitution. So you definitly can't imply stuff about those in the constitution.\n\n \n They don't. Not about abortion at least. The only thing they found implied in the Constitution was that States need justification for restricting a woman's liberty.",

Why do you think we have political judges today? You think that originalists are a \"new\" idea. But this (for the most part) was how a judge knew they were supposed to act. You are suggesting that judges are allowed to pick how they want to interept the law. This is not the case. The power of the judicial as defined in the constitution shows how you take what the law meant when it was written. Will there be judges that lie about what the law meant when written? Yes, however, the judicial is based on trust. We are supposed to trust that they follow the constitution...now they are not. I mean, the president can't say \"i wanna been a dicator\" or \"I wanna be a king\". It just doesn't work that way. The judges have to go by how it is laid out and the beliefs of the framers. If you want to adopt another constitution that says differently then by all means go ahead. However, for now, we go by what the framers said.\n \n \n \nSo... what is the limit? You cannot use opinions or documents that are not binding upon the judiciary to prove the judiciary has gone beyond their powers. What limits, besides his or her beliefs, would be imposed upon the originalist that the Judges today do not have?\n \n You mean who decides if the judicial has gone over their powers? Well Congress normally. However, congress (as americans) see that the judicial has become a political war which is why we have conservative, liberal, and moderate judges. What is a moderate judge? This just makes no sense. I mean with the living constitution you want 9 polictions up there deciding court cases. This is obviously not how our country was set up. The question is, why would congress take out judges when the judges are doing political things. The connection is very obvious.\n \n \nThe judiciary has this within their power. They decide how the law is applied, and this creates a precedence on how the law is applied.\n Yeah, how the LAW is applied...subsantive due process and \"right to privacy\" were never laws. You are suggesting that the judges can simply add new things into laws based on 100% nothing over then how they feel that day, there is no law in that.\n \n \nThey don't. Not about abortion at least. The only thing they found implied in the Constitution was that States need justification for restricting a woman's liberty.\n Well, they found a right to privacy from......amendment 4.5? or 31 or something....who knows.....ANd I still don't see anything that says the states need justification for restricting something that is not defined in the constitution.

The ruling established the limits for allowing abortions. That's legislation. It established a definition of when life begins, that's legislation.\n\n \n What? Within the Roe v Wade decision itself the Justices state that they are cannot decide when life begins, they can only decide from Constitutional law and they could not find anything in the Constitution itself or in precedence that would say the protections of the Constitution applied pre-natally. The ruling stated when abortions could not be banned, but that is within their power.

It would be legislating if the Courts stated \"Abortions cannot be banned in the first trimester (a valid use of the Court's power), but they are banned in the second and third (this would be legislating, an invalid use of their power)\". They do not have the power to make something illegal, only to uphold or strike down laws.\n \n \n\n You prefer your privacy to your life? Curious. emoticon_confused Unlike privacy, the right to life is one of the \"big three\" established by the Constitution.

As far as I know \"right to life\" is NEVER mentioned in the Constitution either.\n \n I prefer a \"right to privacy\" rather than a \"right to life\". A right to privacy can be derived to protect me from bodily harm, thus protecting my life. A right to life protects nothing except from being unplugged.\n \n \n\n They went well beyond that; they legislated. \n \n Back at ya. :p \n\n \n I do not see where they legislated. What does the new law state?\n \n \n\n I'm all in favor of throwing all the bums out and replacing them with people who have actually read and comprehended the Constitution. Right now, we have a Democratic Minority that is attempting to subvert the Constitutional requirement that a President's judicial nominee receive a fair vote and be appointed if a simple majority agrees. There is no \"super majority\" requirement for confirmation, but that's exactly what the Democrats are trying to establish because they lack the numbers to stop an appointment Constitutionally. emoticon_mad\n\n \n This is a bit outside the scope of our discussion. I hardly see it as a huge issue, given that about 200 of Bush's appointees are being voted on. Only about 10 have been protested.",

They do not have the power to make something illegal, only to uphold or strike down laws.\n\n They established the guidelines for allowable abortion . Here's what Justice White along with Justice Renquist wrote in dissent:\n \n\n With all due respect, I dissent. I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment. The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers [410 U.S. 222] and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally dissentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.\n The Court apparently values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life that she carries. Whether or not I might agree with that marshaling of values, I can in no event join the Court's judgment because I find no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the States. In a sensitive area such as this, involving as it does issues over which reasonable men may easily and heatedly differ, I cannot accept the Court's exercise of its clear power of choice by interposing a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it. This issue, for the most part, should be left with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs.\n \n It is my view, therefore, that the Texas statute is not constitutionally infirm because it denies abortions to those who seek to serve only their convenience, rather than to protect their life or health. Nor is this plaintiff, who claims no threat to her mental or physical health, entitled to assert the possible rights of those women [410 U.S. 223] whose pregnancy assertedly implicates their health. This, together with United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62 (1971), dictates reversal of the judgment of the District Court. \n \n\n I invite you to read Justice Douglas' lame explanation in his joining opinion. It is totally absurd and lacking in constitutional basis. \n http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/gov/bl_roe_l.htm\n \n\n Which \"big three\" are those, and where are they stated within the Constitution? As far as I know \"right to life\" is NEVER mentioned in the Constitution either. \n\n The right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is the quote that is most often used to express the intent of our Forefathers. It can be argued that certainly the right to life is fundamental while the right to privacy is only implied at best. \n \n\n I prefer a \"right to privacy\" rather than a \"right to life\". A right to privacy can be derived to protect me from bodily harm, thus protecting my life. A right to life protects nothing except from being unplugged.\n\n Your logic is severely flawed. In order for you to have privacy, you must first have life. If you don't have that fundamental right then no other right exists.\n Dead people don't have rights. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n I do not see where they legislated. What does the new law state?\n \n\n The Court made up a new right, the right to privacy, and then proceded to use this newly-created right to strike down state statutes against abortion as unconstitutional.

I hardly see it as a huge issue, given that about 200 of Bush's appointees are being voted on. Only about 10 have been protested.\n\n Oh, so IYO, justice shouldn't apply to 100% of the nominees?

You consider rewriting the Constitution a valid use of their power?\n \n\n Even Renquist believes the Court has the authority to do this, even if he disagrees with it.\n\n Really? Here's what White and Renquist wrote in opposition:\n \n\n \"the Act provides that a married woman may not obtain an abortion without her husband's consent. The Court strikes down this statute in one sentence. It says that 'since the State cannot . . . proscribe abortion . . . the State cannot delegate authority to any particular person .. even the spouse, to prevent abortion . . .' .. But the State is not .. delegating to the husband the power to vindicate the State's interest in the future life of the fetus. It is instead recognizing that the husband has an interest of his own in the life of the fetus which should not be extinguished by the unilateral decision of the wife. It by no means follows, from the fact that the mother's interest in deciding 'whether or not to terminate her pregnancy' outweighs the State's interest in the potential life of the fetus, that the husband's interest is also outweighed and may not be protected by the State. A father's interest in having a child - perhaps his only child - may be unmatched by any other interest in his life. .. It is truly surprising that the majority finds in the United States Constitution, as it must in order to justify the result it reaches, a rule that the State must assign a greater value to a mother's decision to cut off a potential human life by abortion than to a father's decision to let it mature into a live child. Such a rule cannot be found there, nor can it be found in Roe v. Wade, supra. These are matters which a State should be able to decide free from the suffocating power of the federal judge, purporting to act in the name of the Constitution. \n \n In describing the nature of a mother's interest in [terminating] a pregnancy, the Court in Roe v. Wade mentioned only the post-birth burdens of rearing a child .. and rejected a rule based on her interest in controlling her own body during pregnancy. .. Missouri has a law which prevents a woman from putting a child up for adoption over her husband's objection .. This law represents a judgment by the State that the mother's interest in avoiding the burdens of child rearing do not outweigh or snuff out the father's interest in participating in bringing up his own child. That law is plainly valid, but no more so than .. the Act now before us, resting as it does on precisely the same judgment.\" \n \n\n \n \n\n I have read much on the subject, but I always look toward chances to augment my knowledge. I will explore when I have the time.\n\n Here's some more food for thought for you:\n \n\n Law Without Absolutes \n \n Ever since that black day in January 1973, those who favor abortion have screamed from the housetops about their \"constitutional right\" to abortion. But, in truth, there is no constitutional right for such an act. In Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolten, the Supreme Court, instead of interpreting the Constitution, was actually engaged in judicial activism and the creation of law by judicial fiat. This has been affirmed by those on both sides of the issue. John Hart Ely, a Yale professor, and, himself, a proponent of abortion, has described the Court's decision as \"frightening.\" According to Ely, \"The problem with Roe is not so much that it bungles the question it sets for itself, but rather that it sets a question the Constitution has not made the Court's business...It is bad because it is bad constitutional law, or rather because it is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be\" (Yale Law Journal, 82: 943,947). Professor John T. Noonan, Jr., who was then professor of law at the University of California (Berkeley), has said, \"...none of the existing legislation on abortion conformed to the Court's criteria. By this basic fact alone [the decision] may stand as the most radical decision ever issued by the Supreme Court\" (Human Life Review, 1:28, 1975). Archibald Cox of Watergate-prosecution fame said what should be obvious to all fair-minded men and women: \"The decisions plainly... sweep away established law supported by the moral themes dominant in American life for more than a century in favor of what the Court takes to be a wiser view of a question under active debate...My criticism of [the decision] is that the Court failed to establish the legitimacy of the decision... [and] to lift the ruling above the level of political judgment\" (The Role of the Supreme Court in America, 1976). \n http://members.garbersoft.net/spartacus/roe3.htm \n\n \n\n Yet... it appears nowhere in the Constitution?\n \n If \"right to life\" does not appear in the Constitution, it can only be implied at best.\n\n \n really? What about the Fourteenth, the same amendment that Blackmun bastardized to include the right to privacy. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\\\n Amendment XIV\n \n Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \n\n \n Ironic isn't it?\n \n\n Having no \"right to life\" does not equal death. There is no \"right to life\" in the Constitution now, and we are not all dead. A \"right to privacy\" protects all of our rights better than a \"right to life\"\n\n See above.\n \n\n Ok.\n \n\n OK? so you finally agree?\n \n\n If I remember correctly, Bush has gotten a greater amount of the nominees he wanted through than Clinton did. Threatening to filibuster in order to delay or to eliminate nominees is not a new tactic, by either side.\n\n Republicans NEVER used the filibuster to block votes for judicial nominees. You're being disengenuous by implying otherwise.\n \n\n I have no problem with the Democrats objecting to candidates that have extreme views.\n\n \n So, the ends justify the means, IYO?

The entire decision was arbitrary, the limit of that decision was arbitrary, in fact the entire Court stated that they were feeling peckish that day and wanted to strike down a law, any law.\n \n Judicial fiat? Yes. Abuse of power? Yes. Impeachable? Yes. Legislating? No.\n \n Setting the limit of their own decision may be arbitrary, but it created no law. Unless I am mistaken as to what \"legislating\" means, I do not see your support for stating it was legislating.\n\n If creating a new right out of nothingness isn't legislating, what is? I have explained to you that the SCOTUS fabricated \"the right to privacy\" in Griswold to allow the use of contraceptives in Connecticut, IIRC. It was an obscure case that had little impact on anybody, anywhere because all the SCOTUS did was craft a means to negate an archaic law that nobody cared about, ie, the right to privacy. BUT, along comes Roe v Wade. The SCOTUS wanted to uphold abortion because they saw it as a benefit to society, but they lacked the constitutional justification to do so. Lo and behold, they crafted a means to take this newly-created right to privacy and apply it to include a woman's right to privacy with respect to her own body and voila! they were able to link abortion to a right. Once the link was established, it was used as a sledgehammer to void ALL abortion laws in ALL states because they suddenly became \"unconstitutional\" Now, if it sounds like I painted a sinister picture of the 1973 SCOTUS, you are absolutely correct. It was nothing short of sinister. \n \n\n So, you are claiming the \"right to privacy\" soley upholds abortion? The decision that saw it's existence was decided for the purpose of upholding abortion?\n\n Exactly. It was the only means that was even remotely possible at the time. Remember, we had an activist liberal SCOTUS in search for a constitutional justification that clearly was non-existent in order to uphold a public good.\n \n\n The \"right to privacy\" is a separate issue from whether or not setting the point of their decision's limit to viability is legislating. Even if they legislated the \"right to privacy\" into existance, it does not follow that they legislated abortion, because they stuck down a law banning it which is completely within their power. Even if they used a right they legislated as justification, that does not mean they legislated in the Roe decision.\n\n I agree with your first assertion. The right to privacy, in and of itself, had nothing to do with the court's setting of viability limits. The two are separate examples of judicial activism. Since we've already discussed the creation of rights = legislating, I'll go on to the other topic, viability.\n Rather than quote a big piece here, I invite you to read the following. It is a good summary of the arbitrary nature of Blackmun's viability stipulation.\n http://www.defendingtruth.org/content.asp?content_id=12\n \n\n You are also missing the point. For all intents and purposes, the \"right to privacy\" is as clear as the 2nd amendment in terms of enforcability.\n \n\n The 2nd Amendment isn't a figment of the SCOTUS' imagination as the right to privacy is, but you are right. They are both the law of the land NOW....thanks to an activist SCOTUS. emoticon_mad \n \n\n Actually, substantive due process is used as a litmus test.\n\n It's a garbage catch phrase IMO. \n \n\n That's a nice quote, but it doesn't oppose Roe v Wade. It is in opposition to using Roe to disallow husbands the power to decide whether or not the woman aborts. I think their logic is flawed, but this is a completely different issue.\n\n We'll save this one for another time.\n \n\n The quote you provided me earlier said: As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.\n \n They think the authority is there, but they also think the other Justices exchanged their heads and asses to make the decision.\n\n He was saying that they used manipulation of their authority in an unconstitutional way.\n \n\n Gee whiz, JP, you know better than that. That does not establish a right to life, it states the gov't cannot take your life away without sufficient governmental justification.\n Even if this were not the case, \"right to life\" would still be implied by this, not directly stated.\n\n You're wrong, be'll take this up later as well.\n \n\n No. I consider \"judicial activism\" a buzzword. If you want to spell out what they did wrong and why it was wrong, I can debate you. If you start using buzzwords, I generally won't respond.\n\n I gave you chapter and verse of what they did, not just the use of the term.\n \n\n Jumping the gun there, JP. I said I have no problem with Democrats objecting to extreme nominees. In the same thought, I said that judicial filibusters are an issue. I did not say I approve of the filibuster, or that I thought filibustering is right.\n\n Well, don't be coy, spell it out then. Which side of the fence do you stand on?\n \n\n Look at my quote again. Threatening to filibuster is not a new tactic, and, from what I remember, Republicans used this threat to block Clinton's nominees. I do know that Clinton did not get as many nominees voted on as Bush currently has. Clinton had 30 or so delayed, while Bush only has 10 delayed. For this reason, I don't see what has you and other Republican's so angry and with such hatred.\n\n Clinton had to deal with a Republican Congress. Are you surprised that he didn't get all of the judges rubber stamped? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n I don't think you used \"disingenuous\" correctly. In what way was I being deceptively naive?\n\n I stand corrected. You did indeed add the cavaet \"threatened\". My apologies.",

This was a huge leap in legislating from the bench.\n From Roe v Wade:\n \n\n The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far as Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment; in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments; in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights; in the Ninth Amendment; or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment. These decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed \"fundamental\" or \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. They also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education.\n \n\n Doesn't it appear that the SCOTUS made a leap from an \"implicit right\" to a fundamental, constitutionally guaranteed one?\n \n\n Actually, you are coming across as more paranoid than you are painting them as sinister. You seem to be suggesting that the Justices saw the abortion issue 10 years down the road and decided to \"craft\" a means beforehand in an obscure case. \n\n No, the Justices had a preconceived conclusion, that was already known, and had to \"shop\" for its justification.

I agree that the Court made it difficult for a state to ban abortion unless it did so via Constitutional Amendment, but that doesn't negate the fact that in creating the right to privacy, they acted unconstitutionally.\n It's a question of what came first. If the SCOTUS hadn't previously created the new right to privacy, they would not have had a legal basis for deciding in favor of Roe. But, by first creating the ficticious right and not having it challenged in Griswold, they laid the foundation for future bad judicial actions.\n Griswold created the non-existent \"right to privacy\", Roe v Wade linked that right to abortion and struck down all abortion bans by declaring them unconstitutional.

I heard something on the radio about a \"potential filibuster\". Regardless, what is your objection? No President in recent memory has gotten all of their nominees (in fact Bush Jr has gotten more than any President since Reagan I believe), and the filibuster does not violate the nominees Constitutional rights since an up or down vote by the entire Senate is not required for nominees. At least, the interpretation that has been used for the last 200 years simply requires committee votes, which they received.\n \n Are you equally appalled at the Republicans? In fact, Senator Frist(sp?) himself voted to uphold a filibuster against a judicial nominee in 2000. Further, the Democrats are within Senate rules to do what they are doing. They may be violating tradition by actually following through on their threat, but it is the Republicans who are violating the Senate rules with what they are doing to stop them. These Republicans are deceitful, hypocritical cretins who deserve to be shot. But they are politicians, so I shouldn't expect any differently.\n \n I do want to address your other posts and Steve's posts, and I will when I have more time.",

Therefore, they strike down the law and state that guns are legal but the State can ban some of them.\n\n OK, first, the SCOTUS has a basis for ruling that banning guns is unconstitutional because it actually exists in the Constitution. There was no need for it to fabricate one.\n Second, the Court could rule that the law was \"too vague\" as written and would find it unconstitutional under the garbage clause \"substantive due process\" (your favorite). ;)\n \n\n There is no Constitutional basis for the establishment that any arm can be restricted. However, this is not legislating because they created no law banning nuclear weapons, they simply said that the State could ban them, if they so chose.\n\n Agreed, with one possible exception. If they wrote a list of \"arms\" that could be legislated, it could be argued that was legislating. In Roe v Wade, the SCOTUS didn't just say that the states couldn't ban abortion on demand, it established the legal limits for allowable abortions. That was clearly legislating as you saw in the previously quoted passage.\n \n\n I went there and the page attacked me! ;)\n\n Try again:\n http://www.defendingtruth.org/content.asp?content_id=12\n \n\n But then you are arguing two different things. You agree that Roe made it difficult to ban abortion, but the \"right to privacy\" is invalid? What does this have to do with what I said?\n Yes, the \"right to privacy\" existed first. Roe v Wade created no rights, it did not create the \"right to privacy\" and it did not create a right to abortion (no such right exists). \n Whether or not the \"right to privacy\" is invalid is a separate argument.\n \n\n Not true. Roe v Wade created a right to abortion. It struck down ALL state statutes that disallowed abortion, thereby creating a law allowing abortion nationally.\n \n\n Only laws that they \"feel\" violate our rights. It is perfectly in line with the intent of the 14th, imo. In truth, Roe rests as much on the 14th as it does on the \"right to privacy\".\n\n Huh? The Court used the 14th Amendment as the basis for creating its \"right to privacy\". How can you say that the two are distinguishable? emoticon_confused\n \n\n Well, you are head and shoulders above most pro-life people then, since you are not Republican and you believe in the Constitution :)\n\n Thanks....I think.... ;)\n \n\n Are you sure it's ongoing? I heard something on the radio about a \"potential filibuster\". Regardless, what is your objection? No President in recent memory has gotten all of their nominees (in fact Bush Jr has gotten more than any President since Reagan I believe), and the filibuster does not violate the nominees Constitutional rights since an up or down vote by the entire Senate is not required for nominees. At least, the interpretation that has been used for the last 200 years simply requires committee votes, which they received.\n \n\n The Senate has traditionally allowed an up or down vote for ALL nominees coming out of committee. The use of a filibuster to block the vote is unique.\n \n\n Are you equally appalled at the Republicans? In fact, Senator Frist(sp?) himself voted to uphold a filibuster against a judicial nominee in 2000. \n \n\n Orrin Hatch stated \"They claim Republicans filibustered President Clinton's judicial nominations, but each of his judicial nominees on whom we took a cloture vote is today a sitting federal judge.\"\n \n\n Further, the Democrats are within Senate rules to do what they are doing. They may be violating tradition by actually following through on their threat, but it is the Republicans who are violating the Senate rules with what they are doing to stop them. These Republicans are deceitful, hypocritical cretins who deserve to be shot. But they are politicians, so I shouldn't expect any differently.\n\n Interesting, so the Republican usage of THEIR power to override the Democrat's breakage of Senate rules is a violation of the Senate rules? And it's OK for the Democratic minority to violate tradition, but NOT the Republican majority? Curious sense of fair play that you have. \n \n \n\n I do want to address your other posts and Steve's posts, and I will when I have more time.\n\n \n No hurry.",

   "Yes, that is true, but you're arguing that there are structural problems with the structure that are unrelated to or are only made worse by the quicksand underneath. In order to prove this, we are assuming the structure is on firm foundation. I'm asking you to focus on one or the other.\n\n OK, I'll start with the quicksand, Griswold. Perhaps the best place to start is with Justice Stewart's dissenting opinion.\n \n\n In the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution: the First, the Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth. *528 But the Court does not say which of these Amendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law.\n \n \n We are told that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not, as such, the 'guide' in this case. With that much I agree. There is no claim that this law, duly enacted by the Connecticut Legislature, is unconstitutionally vague. There is no claim that the appellants were denied any of the elements of procedural due process at their trial, so as to make their convictions constitutionally invalid. And, as the Court says, the day has long passed since the Due Process Clause was regarded as a proper instrument for determining 'the wisdom, need, and propriety' of state laws. Compare Lochner v. State of New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937, with Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 83 S.Ct. 1028, 10 L.Ed.2d 93. My Brothers HARLAN and WHITE to the contrary, '(w)e have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws.' Ferguson v. Skrupa, supra, 372 U.S. at 730, 83 S.Ct. at 1031.\n As to the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, I can find nothing in any of them to invalidate this Connecticut law, even assuming that all those Amendments are fully applicable against the States. [Fn1] It has *529 not even been argued that this is a law 'respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' [Fn2] And surely, unless the solemn process of constitutional adjudication is to descend to the level of a play on words, there is not involved here any abridgment of 'the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' [Fn3] No soldier has been quartered in any house. [Fn4] There has been no search, and no seizure. [Fn5] Nobody has been compelled to be a witness against himself. [Fn6]\n \n Fn1. The Amendments in question were, as everyone knows, originally adopted as limitations upon the power of the newly created Federal Government, not as limitations upon the powers of the individual States. But the Court has held that many of the provisions of the first eight amendments are fully embraced by the Fourteenth Amendment as limitations upon state action, and some members of the Court have held the view that the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment made every provision of the first eight amendments fully applicable against the States. See Adamson v. People of State of California, 332 U.S. 46, 68, 67 S.Ct. 1672, 1684 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black).\n \n Fn2. U.S.Constitution, Amendment I. To be sure, the injunction contained in the Connecticut statute coincides with the doctrine of certain religious faiths. But if that were enough to invalidate a law under the provisions of the First Amendment relating to religion, then most criminal laws would be invalidated. See, e.g., the Ten Commandments. The Bible, Exodus 20:2-17 (King James).\n \n Fn3. U.S.Constitution, Amendment I. If all the appellants had done was to advise people that they thought the use of contraceptives was desirable, or even to counsel their use, the appellants would, of course, have a substantial First Amendment claim. But their activities went far beyond mere advocacy. They prescribed specific contraceptive devices and furnished patients with the prescribed contraceptive materials.\n \n Fn4. U.S.Constitution, Amendment III.\n \n Fn5. U.S.Constitution, Amendment IV.\n \n Fn6. U.S.Constitution, Amendment V.\n \n The Court also quotes the Ninth Amendment, and my Brother GOLDBERG's concurring opinion relies heavily upon it. But to say that the Ninth Amendment has anything to do with this case is to turn somersaults with history. The Ninth Amendment, like its companion the Tenth, which this Court held 'states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered,' United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 124, 61 S.Ct. 451, 462, 85 L.Ed. 609, was framed by James Madison and adopted by the States simply to make clear that the adoption of the Bill of Rights did not alter the plan that *530 the Federal Government was to be a government of express and limited powers, and that all rights and powers not delegated to it were retained by the people and the individual States. Until today no member of this Court has ever suggested that the Ninth Amendment meant anything else, and the idea that a federal court could ever use the Ninth Amendment to annul a law passed by the elected representatives of the people of the State of Connecticut would have caused James Madison no little wonder.\n \n What provision of the Constitution, then, does make this state law invalid? The Court says it is the right of privacy 'created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.' With all deference, I can find no such general right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever before decided by this Court. [Fn7]\n \n Fn7. Cases like Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231, and Bates v. City of Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 80 S.Ct. 412, 4 L.Ed.2d 480, relied upon in the concurring opinions today. dealt with true First Amendment rights of association and are wholly inapposite here. See also, e.g., NAACP v. State of Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488; Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 83 S.Ct. 680, 9 L.Ed.2d 697. Our decision in McLaughlin v. State of Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 85 S.Ct. 283, 13 L.Ed.2d 222, is equally far afield. That case held invalid under the Equal Protection Clause a state criminal law which discriminated against Negroes.\n \n The Court does not say how far the new constitutional right of privacy announced today extends. See, e.g., Mueller, Legal Regulation of Sexual Conduct, at 127; Ploscowe, Sex and the Law, at 189. I suppose, however, that even after today a State can constitutionally still punish at least some offenses which are not committed in public.\n \n At the oral argument in this case we were told that the Connecticut law does not 'conform to current community standards.' But it is not the function of this Court to decide cases on the basis of community standards. We are here to decide cases 'agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States.' It is the essence of judicial *531 duty to subordinate our own personal views, our own ideas of what legislation is wise and what is not. If, as I should surely hope, the law before us does not reflect the standards of the people of Connecticut, the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth Amendment rights to persuade their elected representatives to repeal it. That is the constitutional way to take this law off the books. [Fn8]\n \n Fn8. See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 562, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1381, 12 L.Ed.2d 506. The Connecticut House of Representatives recently passed a bill (House Bill No. 2462) repealing the birth control law. The State Senate has apparently not yet acted on the measure, and today is relieved of that responsibility by the Court. New Haven Journal-Courier, Wed., May 19, 1965, p. 1, col. 4, and p. 13, col. 7.\n \n and Black's \n I repeat so as not to be misunderstood that this Court does have power, which it should exercise, to hold laws unconstitutional where they are forbidden by the Federal Constitution. My point is that there is no provision *521 of the Constitution which either expressly or impliedly vests power in this Court to sit as a supervisory agency over acts of duly constituted legislative bodies and set aside their laws because of the Court's belief that the legislative policies adopted are unreasonable, unwise, arbitrary, capricious or irrational. The adoption of such a loose, flexible, uncontrolled standard for holding laws unconstitutional, if ever it is finally achieved, will amount to a great unconstitutional shift of power to the courts which I believe and am constrained to say will be bad for the courts and worse for the country. Subjecting federal and state laws to such an unrestrained and unrestrainable judicial control as to the wisdom of legislative enactments would, I fear, jeopardize the separation of governmental powers that the Framers set up and at the same time threaten to take away much of the power of States to govern themselves which the Constitution plainly intended them to have. [Fn16]\n \n http://www.abortionfacts.com/court_cases/griswald_v_connecticut/black.asp\n \n \n\n \n As can be seen above, Justices Stewart and Black rejected the overly broad \"penumbra\" of rights argument. \n \n\n Truly told, I have had little time recently.\n \n I, too, believe it is a necessary step in the freedom of women, but also believe it has basis in the intent of the Constitution and is covered by both the \"right to privacy\" and the Due Process Clause.\n \n Your second quote proved little besides that Blackmund thought his decision about viability was arbitrary and other's had the opinion that the decision about viability was legislative.

The use of a filibuster to block the vote is unique.\n\n \n No... there are various ways the Senate has to stop judicial nominees from getting an up-or-down vote, including a filibuster. At least, the Senate had the ability until this administration came in and changed nearly all the rules. However, the filibuster remained.\n \n \n\n Orrin Hatch stated \"They claim Republicans filibustered President Clinton's judicial nominations, but each of his judicial nominees on whom we took a cloture vote is today a sitting federal judge.\"\n\n \n Here, check out this article. As Orrin Hatch well knows, many of Clinton's nominess were not given the courtesy of a vote in commitee and Hatch himself used the blue slip, which allowed him to kill a nominee that came from his own state. Of course, once the Republicans had control they eliminated the various tactics the Senate had for the last 200 years to object to judicial nominees\n \n Here is an exerpt:\n \nTraditionally, the filibuster has not been the only weapon in an opposition party's arsenal. There are other, less visible ways whereby the Senate's rules and traditions empower individual senators to block judicial and other nominations. Between 1996 and 2000, Republicans in control of the Senate developed these techniques to a high art. \n [snip]\n Rather than openly challenge President Clinton's nominees on the floor, Republicans decided to deny them Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. Between 1996 and 2000, 20 of Bill Clinton's appeals-court nominees were denied hearings, including Elena Kagan, now dean of the Harvard Law School, and many other women and minorities. In 1999, Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch refused to hold hearings for almost six months on any of 16 circuit-court and 31 district-court nominations Clinton had sent up. Three appeals-court nominees who did manage to obtain a hearing in Clinton's second term were denied a committee vote, including Allen R. Snyder, a distinguished Washington lawyer, Clinton White House aide, and former Rehnquist law clerk, who drew lavish praise at his hearing -- but never got a committee vote. Some 45 district-court nominees were also denied hearings, and two more were afforded hearings but not a committee vote. \n [snip]\n But when the Republicans took over the White House in 2001 and the Senate in 2003, things sped up. In 2003, Hatch announced that he would abandon the \"blue-slip system\" he had insisted on since 1995, whereby a senator could block action on a nominee from his or her home state; North Carolina's Jesse Helms had used this power to block every one of three black candidates to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Anonymous floor holds were abolished, as was the rule requiring that at least one minority-party senator on the Judiciary Committee must agree to a vote on a nominee if any committee member objects. These rules changes left the Democrats with only the filibuster. \n \n Frist's solution to the current stalemate on judicial nominations is a \"simple return to the 200-year of tradition on judges.\" Frist's memory and history are obviously selective. It was just five years ago, in March 2000, that Frist himself participated in the filibuster against Paez after Lott finally overrode the Smith hold. In light of the ferocity with which Republicans stonewalled Clinton's nominees, Frist's entire case folds; the 10 nominees filibustered by Democrats hardly compare to the 65 Clinton nominees denied a vote by the Republicans' under-the-radar procedural maneuvers. \n\n \n Truly, learn more about this and you'll see how dishonest Republicans are on this issue. This has moved further than simple hypocrisy, it has become intentional deceit of the American people. The Democrats may be liars, but Republicans are damn liars.\n \n Here is a biased article, but details a bit more on the hypocrisy of Frist. Here is another one.\n \n \n\n Interesting, so the Republican usage of THEIR power to override the Democrat's breakage of Senate rules is a violation of the Senate rules?\n\n \n The Republicans using their power would violate the tradition that they value so highly, while the Democrats are using a valid power.\n \n \n\n And it's OK for the Democratic minority to violate tradition, but NOT the Republican majority?
