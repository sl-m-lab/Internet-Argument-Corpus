   "WASHINGTON - John R. Bolton, the embattled nominee to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, regularly tried to set up meetings abroad with Russian, British and French officials without notifying the U.S. Embassy or the State Department, the outgoing head of the department's European bureau said Friday. \n \n http://story.news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050430/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/un_ambassador;_ylt=Ar7tfKl2o3JONJdJ9oH99RGs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2bW85OXIzBHNlYwNwbA--",

   "Bolton seems to be exactly the right person for the job of UN Ambassador. From The agendas behind the smears:\n \nThat isn't as easy as it seems, for the case against Mr. Bolton keeps morphing to suit the convenience of the accusers. Early on, the charge was that he holds unacceptable views about the U.N. \"It's hard for me to know why you'd want to work at an institution that you said didn't even exist,\" Senator Barbara Boxer told the nominee. Yet her Democratic colleague Chris Dodd insists he does not oppose Mr. Bolton based on his \"substantive views,\" and that \"in fact, I agree with some of Mr. Bolton's conclusions about the United Nations.\"\n \n Next we heard the nominee's problem was his temper. \"You have a habit of belittling your opposition and even some of your friends,\" said ranking Committee Democrat Joseph Biden at the opening hearing, whereupon his investigators dredged up every alleged instance in which the nominee lost his cool. Yet on Sunday, Mr. Biden told an interviewer that the issue was \"not whether [Mr. Bolton's] a nice guy or not.\"\n \n The latest line on Mr. Bolton is that he's unfit because he may have sought the removal of two intelligence analysts he deemed incompetent and insubordinate. Mr. Bolton says he merely sought their transfer. But even if he had tried to get them fired, so what? A main conclusion of the recent Robb-Silberman report is that policy makers have a duty to question and challenge intelligence analysts.\n \n We recall the time Mr. Biden publicly berated an intelligence analyst--Iraq weapons inspector Scott Ritter--for taking issue with his civilian bosses. Senior Administration officials, Mr. Biden told Mr. Ritter in 1998, \"have responsibilities above your pay grade. . . . That's why they get paid the big bucks. That's why they get limos and you don't.\"\n \n Such are the reasons--the patently disingenuous reasons--given by Mr. Bolton's opponents.\n \n The real motives are a combination of ideological animus and bureaucratic score-settling. On the latter, we know Mr. Bolton tangled with State Department officials who were profoundly antagonistic to President Bush's agenda on issues ranging from the ABM Treaty to the International Criminal Court, and that he usually got his way. Now it's payback time.\n \n ...(snip)...\n \n None of this, however, quite explains the depth of hostility that Mr. Bolton inspires. The deeper explanation is that he set out to explode the consensus views of the foreign-policy establishment--and succeeded.\n \n This was the consensus that held, or holds, that North Korea and Iran can be bribed away from their nuclear ambitions, that democracy in the Arab world was impossible and probably undesirable, that fighting terrorism merely encourages more terrorism, that countries such as Syria pose no significant threat to U.S. national security, that the U.N. alone confers moral legitimacy on a foreign-policy objective, and that support for Israel explains Islamic hostility to the U.S. Above all, in this view, the job of appointed officials such as Mr. Bolton is to reside benignly in their offices at State while the permanent foreign service bureaucracy goes about applying establishment prescriptions.\n \n ...(more)...\n",

So far, they have paid for less than 1/10 of one percent of humanitarian aid. They are going to be providing humanitarian aid, and then sending us the bill. That is what we agreed to. The real expense to the Iraqi war is the fact that the agressor nation (us) is required to pay all humanitarian costs and the cost of rebuilding. In UN led actions, we can kind of fudge this, since there was UN approval for the action, and it was kind of a decision made by the whole world. When we go charging ahead with our coalition of the coerced, bribed, and butt kissers, there is no such protection. We are directly responsible for every penny of humanitarian aid and every penny of rebuilding costs. There is good reason fro this little point in internaitonal law. It would seem unlikely that nations will be rushing to war if you have to pay for everything you blow up, including the oppositions military equipment. Maybe we should have thought this out a little further. teh $200 billion so far is NOTHING next to what the actual rebuilding is going to cost.",

   "Apparently you do not understand how the UN works. When \"special projects\" come up, they do not pay it directly out of their budget. They essentially pass the hat. They managed to choke up nearly 200 billion for the first gulf war.\n\n \n \nThat is because the UN has no money beyond operating costs. In fact, they are not allowed to have their own money. The UN passes the hat to member nations to pay for extraordinary costs. Usually member naitons do a fine job of coughing up thier share.\n\n \n I love how daewoo and Duo are now saying two different things. But that aside, if you think the UN passes the hat and collects the money you are once again wrong and need to look at the financial statements for that time period...www.un.org i believe is the website for it. I can tell none of you are accountants or in finance. The UN just approved of the war, thats all. How does the UN approve of the war? Well the countries approve of it. Even without the UN countries would still dissapprove or approve of a war (see pre UN wars). The money was not mandated or paid out by the UN AT ALL. It was just that the countries supported the war and thus paid. This is true because not every country in the UN paid and none of the membership fees (which is their money) were used for the war. Why? BECAUSE THE UN DIDN'T FUND THE WAR. Just look at the financial statments..I did. It doesn't show an expenditure(expense) for any War related items. The contributions from other countries was done outside of the UN. \n \n You have the false idea that the UN makes countries want to contribute...but you forget that the countries are what make up the UN...so if the UN doesn't approve because say France vetos(hypothetical) but every other country approves then you would probably see all of the other countries helping out eventhough the UN doesn't approve.\n \n So you are wrong Daewoo, the UN didn't pay for the Gulf War.\n \n \nThis is right on par with your \"inflation, what inflation?\" comment. Almost too foolish to comment on, but not quite. No, we did not increase taxes. Instead, we have a record deficit. How do you think that deficit is going to be paid? Not only are we going to end up using tax dollars to pay the deficit, we are going to have to pay to service that debt as well. Personally, I would have reathe rhad the tax hike, since that would have been painful, but less painful in the long run. \n \n\n \n I don't recall a comment like that...so whatever. However, I am a fool right...\n \n \n \nWell, it's comming. We do have a record deficit though. We're going to pay for it in taxes sooner or later. \n \n\n \n Who said tax increases will be needed? Maybe I suppose...There are other ways to pay off something...Decrease your expenses for one.\n \n \nYou're forgetting Japan as well as Germany. \n\n I didn't\n \n16 Billion paid by Germany and Japan\n\n \n \nThey were the means for donations to flow freely from nations who otherwise would not donate. Legitmacy is the key to understand how foregin donations work.\n\n I thought you suggested the UN paid for the War though. The UN is not the legitmacy but rather the approval of the countries from whom you want the donations..see above example\n \n \nWhy is it that nations freely give when the UN gives legitmacy but don't when the UN doesn't? Huh. \n\n One example would make your statement false....So, the UN didn't approve of the Iraq war (recent one) yet England, Spain, Australia, and more donated.\n \n \nThat you still don't understand. They don't pay for it themselves. They are litterally the passer of the hat.\n\n \n Once again, you assume the UN collects the money and pays the bills...NO THE DON'T.

Explain to me how states are going to cut their expenses in the time of rising healthcare and increasinly expensive pensions on top of providing basic services?

YOU\n \n \nI thought you suggested the UN paid for the War though. The UN is not the legitmacy but rather the approval of the countries from whom you want the donations..see above example\n\n \n In a way it does. The UN facilitiates the means for which donations to flow. Without the UN, we pay for it. With the UN, that system takes care of much of the costs. The UN is legitmacy. It is made up of much of the world. If the world does not grant legitmacy, member nations usually will not donate. It is the litteral hat passer. \n \n \nOne example would make your statement false....So, the UN didn't approve of the Iraq war (recent one) yet England, Spain, Australia, and more donated.\n\n \n That is because we resorted to really questionable tactics. For instance, a large number of italian contractors were offered HUGE contracts in iraq prior the invasion. A number of Eastern European countries were given the chance to donate, and if they didn't, they lost US economic and military aid. Not to mention that same tatic worked with the pacific countries. England sponsored this war with us. They don't count. We litterally bribed turkey with several hundred billion dollars. We had to blackmail, threaten and bribe countries to donate troops and money. We never had to do that in the past. \n \n \nOnce again, you assume the UN collects the money and pays the bills...NO THE DON'T\n\n \n What do you not understand about the UN being faciliator of donations? \n \n \nThis would be the UN collecting restricted donations and then having an expenditure for their use (as done in governmental accounting), and this is just not the case.\n\n \n You don't understand accounting either.

THink of one guy (the UN) passing a hat to everyone in order to collect donations into one pot. Now....the guy with the hat then takes this and pays for whatever. THIS IS NOT HOW IT IS DONE.

I guess it depends on the country. For example we donated more to a war that the UN didn't like then we did to one the UN did like :p.\n\n \n No, if the UN sanctioned it, it means that through a UN vote, as well as security council decision that the UN has officially given support, also, it can come in a official UN statement. Iraq got neither. You've skirted the issue. Answer the question. \n \n \n\n Well duh...you would only push a war if you supported it...I don't see your point.\n\n \n Oh boy. I don't know where to start. A country that pushes a war is not going to ask itself for donations. That is stupid. England is hugely differnet in terms of donation status then a country such as Kirbati or Turkey, both of which did NOT push the war like England did. This is REALLY basic. \n \n \n\n Ok, it doesn't go into their accounts...which means they never had the money...which means they never collected it...which means they never paid for it. \n\n \n Finally. The UN is the vessel for which donations are channelled. Think of it this way: Would you more likely donate to: a bully or a organization with global backing to a action you may support? While the money doesn't go the UN, the concept is still very much the same. Through the legitamcy the UN grants, nations voluntarily give to such actions. The end result in the US pays less for its little adventures. Without the UN we pay more. With the UN we pay far less.

NO. \n Are they putting into their budget? NO.\n Are they adding in to any fund in their account? NO.\n Are they including it for future UN expenses?

Is our public education system really so bad that I can typoe \"the un does not pay for wars\" that many times, and you really feel that \"You are wrong becuase the UN does not pay for wars\" is a viable response?\n \n NO, THE UN DID NOT FUND THE WAR. We have been over that,k and over that. Why is it not on their finacial statement, BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FUND THE WAR. They asked member nations to fund the war, negotiated funding from nations willing to kick in, and the war was funded. The money never went to the UN. The UNs sole jop was to negotiate with nations willing to help fund it. \n \n You still have not addressed the fact that last itme, we paid for very littl eof the war, and this time we are paying for all of it, and the sole reason other nations have given ofr refusing to contribute is \"no UN approval\".

Even the coutries that were willing to sign onto our coalition were unwilling to put any cash up. Again, go back and look at how much we paid for in this war, and how much we paid for int eh last gulf war. Look also at how much we ended up paying for bosnia, or any other UN sanctioned war.

The only differnces is that we and the brits took them up on the offer. \n \n \n\n We got the nuclear material (which was the objective),\n\n \n No, the objective was to shut down Libya's WMD production. \n \n \n\n and we got it directly from Libya. If you think it's more important who made the final arrangements, or if you refuse to see the cause and effect, that's your problem.\n\n \n If you refuse to see that the US didn't play a major role in shutting down the Libyan operation yet give credit where it is not due, that's your problem. But then again, Bush and Co gave some of the most incompetent officials awards. I guess you're no different in such a belief.",

   "Thanks man....Is it just me though or is Duo saying the UN paid for the Gulf War but at the same time saying they did it off the books for some strange reason?\n\n \n No, he is utilizing a metaphore in saying that they \"pass the hat\", and you are apparently not bright enough to pick it up.\n \n What the UN does is requests money from member nations to cover UN approved wars.

   "HAHAHAAH Duo..You are changing your story now.\n \n First you talk about how the UN paid for the war....now you claim that they reallly don't pay for it but rather \"channel\" it...Which I don't even know what this means...passing the hat? What do you think the UN does? They just kinda tell countries to put donated money to this location??? Please Duo, you thought the UN paid for the war because other countries gave money to the UN and then the UN paid...that was your arguement and you are now denying it and making up stuff that I have said. I don't know where this budget stuff comes from but whatever man. Learn to take a defeat like a man. \n \n \n \n Anyway, I am just gonna run down the changes in your views...\n \n \nFirst of all, do you know how much the first gulf war cost the US? Do you know who paid for the rest?\n\n \n \nEverythign from the first gulf war, to bosnia, to ecomog troops in Sierra Leone have been paid for by the UN\n\n \n \nWhen \"special projects\" come up, they do not pay it directly out of their budget. They essentially pass the hat. They managed to choke up nearly 200 billion for the first gulf war.\n I am going to assume you mean total cost here and not the war itself...otherwise you would be way off (and that 200billion is already high)\n \n \nThe UN gave legitamacy and was the vessel for donations. Notice we don't have that now.\n\n \nThey don't pay for it themselves. They are litterally the passer of the hat.\n\n Now the money is not actually paid by the UN but rather the UN collects it via a very large hat and carries it in some vessel to some undisclosed location I presume. Oh course \"passing the hat\" would assume a collection of some sort and thus reported on their financial statements..however we know now this is not true. Lets continue...\n \n \nThat is because the UN has no money beyond operating costs. In fact, they are not allowed to have their own money. The UN passes the hat to member nations to pay for extraordinary costs. Usually member naitons do a fine job of coughing up thier share.\n \n No money beyond a cost? This would be like saying I have no money other then my rent expense. HOwever, this is another hat gathering.\n \n \nIn a way it does...With the UN, that system takes care of much of the costs.\n To my question about whether the UN pays for the war or not....So now we are back to the UN actually paying for it. \n \n \nWhat do you not understand about the UN being faciliator of donations? \n Now the UN is back down to just making the donation process easier....IN THE SAME POST NO LESS!!\n \n \nThe funds don't come from the UN's budget. The donations don't go there either. There isn't any allocation in the UN's budget for such instances. The UN, when things like this occur, goes out and asks for donations. It passes the hat around.\n \n Same post again!! They are now passing the big hat again. Collecting the donations but now OFF the books! Interesting. The funny thing about this post is that outta no where Duo assume that expenditures appear on the budget along with donations...hmmm, I suppose in making a budget they project this however they don't know specific donations so it is very obvious I am referring to some kind of financial statement. Then Duo says...\n \nconsidering how it has already been explained to you twice that the funds don't come from the UN budget\nWhere I had never even mentioned a budget. This just amused me.\n \n did we say it was literal? No. \n Actually you did.\n \nThey don't pay for it themselves. They are litterally the passer of the hat.\nWhich makes this the funniest part of it all.\n \n \nWhat do you not understand about THE MONEY DOES NOT COME FROM THE BUDGET?\n Back to your random budget comments again..you posted this twice in the same post.\n \n \nIt doesn't go into their accounts nor does it go on their books. \n This was in response to me saying \"Passing the hat implies a collection\"..to which you only responded in the fact that they do not go on their accounts. So from this we conclude that they are NOT on the accounts however the UN IS holding the money...Interesting.\n \n \nWow, it took you THAT long to figure that out? No one is saying the UN paid for it.\n\n \nEverythign from the first gulf war, to bosnia, to ecomog troops in Sierra Leone have been paid for by the UN\n\n Oh really? No one said that huh. Another fun fact.\n \n \nFinally. The UN is the vessel for which donations are channelled.\n Now we are back to the transporting function of the UN. They don't actually \"pay\" they just act at the transporting unit..I am assuming with the big hat...They put this big hat on a boat and ship it to varies locations. Very kind of them. However this would assume a transport cost on the financial statements..funny I didn't see that.\n \n \nDirectly? No. \n Did they allow other countries to freely give when they would normally not and therefore cut down Us expenses? Without a doubt. In that sense, UN legitmacy PAID for the gulf war.\nNow the UN legitmacy paid for the Gulf War...The fact that the UN is so high and mightly made people drool all over the place and just start cutting checks for the Gulf War. I guess the fact that countries make a decision on whether or not they support the war BEFORE they vote in the UN is irrelevant. Oh well, who cares about facts right? So before the UN paid for the war...then the UN was the transport unit..now the legitmacy of the UN paid for it. Interesting turn of events.\n \n \nNO, THE UN DID NOT FUND THE WAR.\n But wait...didn't you say earlier that...oh nevermind emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nThe UNs sole jop was to negotiate with nations willing to help fund it.\nNow you actually might have a point here. The UN might have asked countries to help pay for the war...however, this is not paying but merely helping to get donations. You guys made it seem like the people that make Cokes advertisments paid for all the cokes bought.\n \n \nWhat the UN does is requests money from member nations to cover UN approved wars. The negotiate with nations who are willing and able to pay, tihngs like amount and payment schedule, and they allocate the money to the various countries that have expenses related to the military action. There are 2 options as far as payments go. Sometimes they set up an escrow account (generally for humanitairan disasters) and a board of trustees is drawn from the general assembly to manage the account and authorize payments\n Now we are getting into the \"big\" words like ESCROW accounts. Now, I don't know if they do actually have escrow accounts for humanitarian add or not, however, an escrow account doesn't make sense to me because normally it involves the lending of money(however not the only way an escrow account is used). However, for the benefit of the doubt we can assume they do have escrow accounts which would mean that there is an account(not nesacerrily the escrow account) on the UN's books. So where is it? I though Duo said there was none? Oh well.\n \n \nThe second option, and the one almost always utilized for military actions, is that they negotiate for the donations, and they are immediatly transfered from the donor country to whoever is leading the military action \n This option makes a bit more sense but it just shows that the UN acts more of an auditor and not a holder of money. You said they make sure thet money is used correctly. This might be true, however, your orginal claim that the UN paid for the Gulf War is still false.\n \n \nDo you really have an accounting degree? You are not advising your clients to buy CD's now are you???\n \nYeah I do have an accounting degree. As I said earlier I would never advise anyone to get a CD unless you can have VORs insanely unlikely scenario. I did make a mistake with talking about that though. I think I read what VOR said incorrectly, however, I corrected myself later on.",

   "Looking at Daewoo's post about the Escrow Accounts a little more I think this actually might be a legtimate way to do it. However this said you guys still said the UN paid for the war and this is still way off. However, with daewoo's last post he talks about escrow accounts being used.\n \n I realized that he may have worded it a little funny to where it doesn't make sense so I am going to talk a bit about escrow accounts. As I said they are normally for debt paying however they are used in many cases such as combination of businesses where certain things have to happen in the future.\n \n An Escrow is asset normally held by a third party for delievery to someone when certian conditions are met. Think of it as someone says they will give you 5 bucks if you can jump 10 feet in the air. You give the money to your neutral friend who will give it you if you do the task. This guartenees the money a little better. So in this sense a country could give money to the UN so that the UN in the \"escrow\" agent. Now this obviously sets up an escrow account. I will look into more whether or not the UN has these beyond normal relief efforts. I am not sure who actually has these escrow accounts (however the money remains part of donors money until transfer normally). Let me look into it and I will get back to you.\n \n I do know that they didn't use this to \"pay\" for the Gulf War as this would be impossible and that they would have done nothing more then making sure conditions are met (assuming relief monies). So until I see how escrow accounts are used in the UN I will stop talking :p.\n \n All of this being said..it makes everything you guys said false except Daewoo's last post. So don't try to say you were right.",

   "Anyway, I am just gonna run down the changes in your views...\n\n \n Sorry, I only recently realised you were not bright wnought to pick up ont eh fact that \"passing the hat\" was a metaphore. There is actually no hat involved. You are also correc t in your contention that the UN itself does nto pay for the war. They just do all the negotiation, oversigt, and facilitate the transfers. \n \n I suppose that if you want to argue that the nations would help out anyway, you could. It is going to be an uphill battle, though, since you cannot show a single occurance of this. \n \n \n \n \n I am going to assume you mean total cost here and not the war itself...otherwise you would be way off (and that 200billion is already high)\n\n \n Actually, that numebr is low. The sanctions in Iraq were part of the first gulf war, and over 50 billion was spent JUST delivering humanitarian aid to Iraqis during the sanctions.\n \n \n \nNo money beyond a cost? This would be like saying I have no money other then my rent expense. HOwever, this is another hat gathering.\n\n \n Yes, operating funds only. No special project funds can be held by the UN.\n \n \nNow we are getting into the \"big\" words like ESCROW accounts.

However, for the benefit of the doubt we can assume they do have escrow accounts which would mean that there is an account(not nesacerrily the escrow account) on the UN's books. So where is it? I though Duo said there was none? Oh well.\n\n \n the majority of escrow accounts have nothign to do with lending. Escrow accounts are commonly utilized any time there is a contractual obligation in return for cash, at least when you are dealing with big numbers or entities of uncertain financial stability. The escrow system was set up in the early 70's because nations would promise money and then never cough it up (ok, mostly the US woul do this). The escrow system does away with such problems, as well as ensuring full accountability for expended funds. \n \n The escrow account is never held by the UN (another safeguard against corruption). It is generally held at chase manhattan. Either a panel of folks from the general assembly are elected or appointed to carry out oversee humanitarian aid, or an organization (usually the red cross) is appointed. This is simply an oversight position. Such funds are never held buy the UN never directly controlled by the UN, and are inaccessible to the UN. Why would they be on the UNs books again? Do you commonly put money that doe not belong to you, you do not control, and you never touch on your books? You know that may be a crime, right?\n \n \n This option makes a bit more sense but it just shows that the UN acts more of an auditor and not a holder of money. You said they make sure thet money is used correctly. This might be true, however, your orginal claim that the UN paid for the Gulf War is still false.\n\n \n You re right. They simply facilitate the transfers, arrange for the donations, and negotitate amonts, payment schedules and later oversee disbursment.\n \n Now that we are done with your childish nitpicking, would you like to return to the point at hand?\n \n Wihtou the UN fulfilling its role, we are stuck paying the tab for our global adventures all by ourselves. Is that really what you want?\n \n How many years of UN dues could we have paid with the trillion dollars that the war and reconstruction in Iraq is likely to end up costing us? You aregue that nations may be willing to klick in despite the fact that the UN has not snctioned the mission. Where are they? Or, more importantly, where is their money? All we have ehard tus far from these folks is \"no UN, no money\".\n \n So now we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars blowing things up in Iraq, and we are now required to rebuild all the stuff we blew up. We have removed a secular governent in the ME, and installed a government composed of islamic fundamentalists. We ahev forced an alliance between Syria and Iran, backed by russia, and there is still no indication that terrorism has been negatively effected.\n \n None of this should be a surprise. We were warned about every one of htese negative ocnsequences before the war. We simply failed to listen. Typical Americna arrogance really, we believed that we knew more about the region, and likely effects of a mess liek this there, than folks who were actully form the ME.\n \n That is the other point of the UN. Besides lending legitimacy and helping to get money together to pay for such things, it gives an impartialinternational forum so other viewpoints can be heard. Do you really think that a bunch of rich white protestants in washington, all of whome were bordn to wealth and privelage, have any real clue about how a muslim arab is likely to react to an attack on Iraq? Hardly. Int he UN GA, however, there are plenty of muslim arabs who are much better acquainted with how such a thing is likely to be percieved.\n \n Despite the heckling form the republicans, France and Germany most likely did nto oppose the invasion of Iraq becuase they were afraid that their dealing with saddam would be discovered. None of those dealings were actually illegal. they didn't want to get involved in the mess that was predicted to follow such an invasion.",

You say that I am a \"liar\" because I mentioned the word \"budget\" earlier...HOwever, you failed to realize that had nothing to do with what we are talking about. I said the whole budget couldn't be used to pay for the Gulf War...this is true because the budget is pretty small. So why do you claim that I said donations go on the budget? You are crazy man. \n \n \nI guess I assumed you knew how the system worked. Apparently you did not.

I suppose if Microsoft collected money it would put it on the books. A good example of this would be money related to Revenue.

   "Duo,\n \n you are funny and I take it you never read my post.\n\n \n Considering how you keep jabbering about how it's not on their statments even when we've said it doesn't come from their budget, I take it you never read my posts. \n \n \n\n What is with you and the UN budget anyway? I swear you just keep bringing it up.\n\n \n Because you keep bringing it up. \n \n \nYou say that I am a \"liar\" because I mentioned the word \"budget\" earlier...HOwever, you failed to realize that had nothing to do with what we are talking about.\n\n \n On the contrary, you brought the budget up. We did not. \n \n \nI said the whole budget couldn't be used to pay for the Gulf War...this is true because the budget is pretty small.\n\n \n And we told you THE MONEY DOES NOT COME FROM THE BUDGET, I forget, is that the 150th or 151st time we've told you that? \n \n \nSo why do you claim that I said donations go on the budget? You are crazy man.\n\n \n You keep claiming the payments come from the bugedet, even in spite of the 150 or 151 times we've told they don't. FOR THE LAST TIME, THE MONEY DOES NOT COME FROM THE BUDGET How hard is that to understand? \n \n \n\n Did you ignore your post that talked about the UN PAYING FOR THE GULF WAR???? I guess so.\n\n \n Which one? I never said the UN paid for the gulf war. If you will notice, LEGITMACY has been a key part of my argument from the very get go. \n \n \n\n This was after you said that the UN PAYS THE MONEY...Very inconsistent duo.\n\n \n Since I never said that, you're fabricating. I never said the UN pays the money. \n \n \nIf the UN collects the money it would put it on the books...that is basic accounting.\n\n \n Does it keep the money? Does it spend the money? Does the money actually ever see a UN account? Obvious answer: NO. Why would they record capital they never touch? For a accountant, you seem to be in need of a refresher. \n \n \nIf the UN collects the money it would put it on the books.\n\n \n You assume they keep it. That isn't true at all. They don't touch the money at all. All the hat passer DOES is hold the hat, they don't touch the money. Eventually the hat get passed to the country who's leading the action. \n \n \nthat is basic accounting.\n\n \n Basic accounting doesn't tell you to record money you never touch, hold, spend or do anything with that involves your company. seriouisly, if you're going to say you have a degree, at least act like it. \n \n \nI suppose if Microsoft collected money it would put it on the books.\n\n \n Not if the money wasn't revelant to their operating activites. Oh wait, the money the UN collects isn;'t revelant to their operating activites.\n \n \nA good example of this would be money related to Revenue. SOmething is sold and then put on Accounts Receivable and thus counted as a revenue...however some accounts receivable are never collected and therefore this would be money on the books that microsoft will never touch (it is then written off later on).\n\n \n Nice try. That was bad analogy. First of all, AR is a sale on credit. The donations allowed by UN legitmacy are not on credit. It is a direct transfer of funds. Not to mention that no sales are in this transaction, nor is any revenue involved as well. Bad debts are irrelevant in this transaction as well. \n Your analogy works as if the company was actively selling a product. The UN does not do this. I'll tell you this, you're a terrible actor. \n \n \n\n Duo, you can't avoid the fact that your orginal post was that the UN paid for the Gulf War.\n\n \n Please, where did I say that.\n \n \nAlright, VOR, do you want higher taxes? \n \n That's what you're going to get with the US out of the UN \n \n Who's going to pay for all of our adventures? \n \n Idiocy.\n\n \n tell me, where does it say that UN pays for the gulf war? Oh wait, it doesn't. \n \n [qupte]You then changed to the hat system that even Daewoo says is not exactly accurate.[/quote]\n \n I haven't changed at all. Do you understand how legitmacy works in donations? \n \n \n There you go with the budget thing again...outta no where and total disregard for the blatent sarcasim in the statement.\n \n This was in regards to you saying the following:\n \n \n \n To which I responded that you actually did say it was literal...\n\n \n Wow, that was incredibly stupid. You charge that I said the UN litterally pays for the war. What the post you cite says is that the UN is the literal HAT PASSER, there's a difference between the people paying and the guy rounding rounding the money up to send to a third party. You're fabricating that I said that the UN litterally pays. Once again, you're lying. \n \n \n\n That is why it was so funny...because you totally did a 180 on that one.\n \n\n \n Do you understand the difference between the hat passer and the donator? Under your logic, the Church plate passers are the same people as those who give money. STUPIDITY. \n \n \n\n Maybe you would like to tell me what accounting is...we can see how badly you screw it up.\n\n \n Sure. Accounting is the collection, recording and reporting of information that is reliable, relevant and comparable. Please, call that wrong. I DARE YOU. :) \n \n \n\n Then you asked where you have changed your views...and it was insanly obvious in my post. So to sum it up:\n\n \n Not really. COnsidering you have basically lied on a several occasions as well as avoid how legitmacy has been the key part of my arguments, you have failed miserably. \n \n \n\n You said:\n Which shows you thought the UN paid for it.\n\n \n How? Where did I say the UN paid for it? Oh wait, I didn't. Fabrication anyone? \n \n \n\n then you went on to say it is a \"hat passing system\". Although you evolved your hat passing system to go from the UN collecting the money and then giving it out to just the UN asking for people to donate money to this other guy.\n\n \n How is that any different? Church platter passeres are passing the hat and asking people for donations. How is this any different? Oh wait, it's not. :) \n \n \nwhat degrees do you hold?\n\n \n What does it matter? I never claim any higher education. It helps, especialyl when people do fail miserably at proving it.\n \n Btw: you still haven't discussed what a transfer payment is, nor have you answered why with UN sanctioned actions donations are much higher and voluntary then without",

   "Considering how you keep jabbering about how it's not on their statments even when we've said it doesn't come from their budget, I take it you never read my posts.\n\n lol you still think financial statements means budget...that is just funny. Just to help you out I am going to show you how your whole thing about \"budgets\" came out of no where....\n \n You said:\n \nWho's going to pay for all of our adventures? \n \n\n To which I said:\n \nlol we pay 22% of the UN budget so how would that mean higher taxes?\nShowing that getting out of the UN would save that much money if we got out. (Some 500million+) Which also shows that the UN can't pay for a war because they don't raise enough money. However, a budget amount doesn't always show expenditures in a year and thus to find out what was actually spent in a year you look at the end of year financial records. \n \n Then you said:\n \nFirst of all, do you know how much the first gulf war cost the US? Do you know who paid for the rest?\n Showing once agian you think thte UN paid for the Gulf War\n \n ...a many posts go by and then...\n \n You said:\n \nYou don't understand accounting either. The funds don't come from the UN's budget.\nThis came outta left field because all I talked about is how it would be shown as an expenditure and donation...obviously this is shown on a financial statement or even just a normal record. So this was the start of your \"budget\" talking which came out of left field and no one knew what you were talking about.\n \n You then said:\n \nOn the contrary, you brought the budget up. We did not. \n We just showed you are the one that did this.\n \n \nAnd we told you THE MONEY DOES NOT COME FROM THE BUDGET, I forget, is that the 150th or 151st time we've told you that\n\n See, there you go again. You have no idea what I wrote. I said with that post that even if you took the whole UN budget you couldn't pay for the war. Much the same way you can say \"All of Fort Knox couldn't pay for ______\"...wow are you really that dense?\n \n \nYou keep claiming the payments come from the bugedet, even in spite of the 150 or 151 times we've told they don't. FOR THE LAST TIME, THE MONEY DOES NOT COME FROM THE BUDGET How hard is that to understand? \nWHERE DID I SAY THAT??? Oh right, NO WHERE. I said that with your thoughts of the UN paying for it that they would have something on the financial statements that showed this..and they don't...thats is what I said. Where do you get \"budget\" from \"financial statements\"?\n \n \nWhich one? I never said the UN paid for the gulf war. \nI posted a bunch of them. You said \"who would pay for our adventures\" and \"who do you think pays for them\"...both clearly referring to the UN. Can't deny that.\n \n \nDoes it keep the money? Does it spend the money? Does the money actually ever see a UN account? Obvious answer: NO. Why would they record capital they never touch? For a accountant, you seem to be in need of a refresher. \n \n It doesn't even collect the money...which was my whole arguement. You keep on claiming they do without realizing that if they collected it aka pass the hat, then it would be on a financial statement as a collection(donation) and then expenditure for it goign out. Wow, and I am the slow one?\n \n \nYou assume they keep it. That isn't true at all. They don't touch the money at all. All the hat passer DOES is hold the hat, they don't touch the money. Eventually the hat get passed to the country who's leading the action. \nlol, ok, so passing the hat means collection. If you collect something then you record that somewhere somehow. I know you aren't in accounting, but trust me. You record that. It would be shown as a collection and then an expenditure out. Governments do this all time...For example a government that collects taxes for another government. THis is seriously funny.\n \n \nNot if the money wasn't revelant to their operating activites\n So companies only record money related to operating activities...This is funny as well....I guess you don't realize that companies record money for financing and investing activities too. Moreover, governments do things differently however, they still have more then \"operating activites\"\n \n \nNice try. That was bad analogy. First of all, AR is a sale on credit. The donations allowed by UN legitmacy are not on credit. It is a direct transfer of funds. Not to mention that no sales are in this transaction, nor is any revenue involved as well. Bad debts are irrelevant in this transaction as well. \n Your analogy works as if the company was actively selling a product. The UN does not do this. I'll tell you this, you're a terrible actor.\n\n You just asked for an example of a company that records money they never see...and that is an example. Accural accounting for the win.\n \n \ntell me, where does it say that UN pays for the gulf war? Oh wait, it doesn't\nThe fact that you never said the exact words \"the UN paid for the Gulf War\" doesn't mean you implied it so many times. You were talking about what would happen if the US got out of the UN and then who would pay for our adventures...You did that twice and then never said Daewoo was wrong when he posted the quote about the gulf war was paid by the UN. To any reasonable person you thought the UN paid for the Gulf War...Stop denying it.\n \n \n\n Wow, that was incredibly stupid. You charge that I said the UN litterally pays for the war. What the post you cite says is that the UN is the literal HAT PASSER, there's a difference between the people paying and the guy rounding rounding the money up to send to a third party. You're fabricating that I said that the UN litterally pays. Once again, you're lying. \n \nNice try duo. I didn't say that at all...I wasn't lying but showing how you changed positions...lets look at it again.\n \nIt is the litteral hat passer.\n\n THis is what you said\n \nthe guy with the hat then takes this and pays for whatever. THIS IS NOT HOW IT IS DONE\n\n \ndid we say it was literal? No. \n\n This is what I said to which you responded....So does the UN literally pass the hat or not?? It seems I am not lieing after all....good try.\n \n \nSure. Accounting is the collection, recording and reporting of information that is reliable, relevant and comparable.\nWell, you combined book keeping and accounting and overly simplified them both. Financial accounting is the accounting that deals with the comparable and relevant aspect mostly as they are involved with external users. Then you got Managerial accounting (aka cost accounting) which deals with internal stuff such as your famous budget. So you are close...a better answer would have been to say accounting is a type of information system because when you add relevant and comparable you are referring to more financial accounting. I will give you a 8/10 on the quiz.\n \n \nNot really. COnsidering you have basically lied on a several occasions as well as avoid how legitmacy has been the key part of my arguments, you have failed miserably. \n \nlol, calling people \"liars\" now...very mature. You changed things to include legitmacy now. Just admit you thought the UN paid for the War and get on with life. It is very clear and by saying \"pass the hat\" you make it seem like the UN collects the money when they don't. This has been shown on many accounts. \n \n \nChurch platter passeres are passing the hat and asking people for donations. How is this any different? Oh wait, it's not\nYeah, and the church records that money on their books and guess what!! on their financials statements too. In fact, my church will give you a little booklet saying how much you donated on the front and the financial statements in it (collection plate where you write your name on an envelope and stick it in there).\n \n \nyou still haven't discussed what a transfer payment is\n\n My mistake...I thought I did however I guess I didnt.\n A transfer would imply an interfund transfer of money or other assets. Something from the Federal government to the state is normally called a \"grant\" or something like that. Transfer is like the state government general fund giving money to the Debt Service Fund to pay for interest on Bonds. A transfer can also happen from a governmental type fund to a business type fund. Would you like for me to go into how they account for this or would you like to read GASB principle 11 to find out more?\n \n \n \n \n Bottom Line: Pass the Hat is also known as a collection. Collection would be recorded. Since a collection was not recorded we know the UN doesn't \"pass the hat\"...Thus the UN paid for nothing, \"transferred\" nothing, expended nothing, and did NOTHING more then say the Gulf War is approved by the UN. To say donations came because of this is simply a guess. Maybe a country was convinced maybe not. I happen to believe a country already knows whether they support a war or not before they vote in the UN...so whatever.",

Not to mention that the build up for Operation Desert Storm took 6 months and went past a operating cycle. It would have been included in their next year's budget. Also, the entire Balkan's peacekeeping has been running for a decade, it would be non-sense to say that such expenditures wouldn't have been on their budget while they paid for it. Do you really have a accounting degree? \n \n \nShowing once agian you think thte UN paid for the Gulf War\n\n \n Please. I made no mention of the UN paying for such.

That is percisely what you are doing. taking a unspecified question and then proclaiming that you know what I think when I said that. Sheer stupidity. emoticon_wow \n \n \nThis came outta left field because all I talked about is how it would be shown as an expenditure and donation\n\n \n Except you brought up the budget in the first place. It's not inherently accounting either. If the UN paid for such actions, often spanning several years, the money would have been allocated in their budget. Problem is that didn't occur. \n \n \nthis is shown on a financial statement or even just a normal record.\n\n \n Do you know what a budget is?

I never said the Un paid for the war. How does it feel to be a liar? \n \n \nI posted a bunch of them.\n\n \n WRONG I never said that the UN paid. I asked if you knew. You obviousld did not. If you want to prove your claim, find where I said \"The UN paid for the war.\" Oh wait, I never said. Guess you;re lying again. \n \n \nYou said \"who would pay for our adventures\" and \"who do you think pays for them\"...both clearly referring to the UN. Can't deny that.\n\n \n Um, no. Do you know who pays for our adventures? Countries who donat ebecause of UN legitmacy. Please, you're NEVER going to prove that I said the UN paid for war because I never said it. Oddly you keep quoting me but you've never found a quote from me which says what you are fabricating. \n \n \nthen it would be on a financial statement as a collection\n\n \n I ask you again, why would the UN record money it never touches and is not revelant? You seem to keep avoiding that like the plague. Oh yes, because if you answered, you'd instantly prove your claims wrong. \n \n \nIf you collect something then you record that somewhere somehow\n\n \n Why? If the money is not revelant towards the organization, why would they record it? \n \n \nGovernments do this all time...For example a government that collects taxes for another government\n\n \n Bad analogy. The money collected from another government is revelant towards the collector. The money that is given to the leading country from the UN asking for donations is not revelant towards the UN's finances. THis is seriously funny, considering how you keep avoiding the questions as well as revelancy of the money in regards to statements.\n \n \nSo companies only record money related to operating activities\n\n \n For companies no, for the UN which does not sell anything nor has revenue, yes. The entire recording is all operating. There are no selling or manufacturing activites, or financing as well. \n \n \nI guess you don't realize that companies record money for financing and investing activities too.\n\n \n On the contrary, I know that very well. What is amusing is that you think the UN would record activites is does not do. Seems rather stupid to me. Would a manufacturing company record any financing activities if it had none for the operating cycle? Or how about a fast food joint, do they record manfacturing activities? No. Because they don't do them. It is the same with the UN. They do not record activities they do not do. I would not hire you to be my accountant. \n \n \nMoreover, governments do things differently however, they still have more then \"operating activites\"\n\n \n But the UN is not per se the normal government. IT does not collect taxes. It does not operate long term financing. It does not have selling expenses (except the UN merchandise, but that is irrevelant). \n \n \nYou just asked for an example of a company that records money they never see\n\n \n Bad example. The company sees parts of the accounts recieveable. Not to mention if the materiality is high enough, they sue them to get their cash. They see the money. Also bad debt is from a sale. The UN conducts no such activities. You're comparing apples and oraganes. \n \n \nThe fact that you never said the exact words \"the UN paid for the Gulf War\" doesn't mean you implied it so many times\n\n \n Well, I did use legitmacy as a means of donations from the very beginning, I suppose you're simply not bright enough to understand how that systme works. \n \n \n You were talking about what would happen if the US got out of the UN and then who would pay for our adventures\n\n \n Yes we would be. AS the UN would not give legitmacy upon our actions, countries would not donate. If they do not donate, we pay the bill instead of them. How hard is this to understand? \n \n \nYou did that twice and then never said Daewoo was wrong when he posted the quote about the gulf war was paid by the UN.\n\n \n I don't read everything Daewoo posts. Ah, fallacy: raising the bar. You'll notice that I mention legitmacy far more then twice in this thread. Notice how you ignore such claims. Fallacy: selective reading. That makes you guilty of fraud on two counts. \n \n \nany reasonable person you thought the UN paid for the Gulf War...Stop denying it.\n\n \n Prove it. Explain how my argument which revolves around legitmacy proves that I said the UN paid for the gulf war. Not to mention I even linked a cite which gave exact numbers as to who donated and how much. Notice that site doesn't have the UN as a donater. Guess that proves you wrong. Please stop making accusations you have absolutely no hope of proving. \n \n \nNice try duo. I didn't say that at all...I wasn't lying but showing how you changed positions...lets look at it again.\n\n \n Your sheer stupidity? I could say that was a nice way of entertaining me and dispelling any linger doubts in my mind about your lack of intelligence. \n \n \nThis is what I said to which you responded....So does the UN literally pass the hat or not?? It seems I am not lieing after all....good try.\n\n \n Hat passer and donater are two very different things. You've again ignored how my church passer analogy proves you oh so very wrong. Fallacy: selective reading. Three counts of fraud. \n \n \nWell, you combined book keeping and accounting and overly simplified them both\n\n \n That is the textbook defition of accounting.\n \n \nFinancial accounting is the accounting that deals with the comparable and relevant aspect mostly as they are involved with external users.\n\n \n You never specified managerial vs financial, or accural vs cash. fallacy: raising the bar. Four counts of fraud \n \n \nhen you got Managerial accounting (aka cost accounting) which deals with internal stuff such as your famous budget\n\n \n Internal stuff? How about custom fit, day to day reports detailing exactly what the operators and boards wants to see. Also, they aren't gaap. :p \n \n \nSo you are close\n\n \n No, I am correct. That is the textbook definition of accounting. You didn't specific which type. \n \n \nreferring to more financial accounting\n\n \n That is utter stupidity. Managerial deals with relevant and comparable within a company. From year to year. Are you telling me that Managerial doesn't use revelant and comparable information in its reports? :p \n \n You're on shaky ground here , it doesn't help that you're guilty of fraud on four counts. \n \n \nYou changed things to include legitmacy now\n\n \n WHAT? Look at post #27. That was my second response to you. How am I changing it now to include legitmacy when it was in my argument from the very beginning? YOU LIE. \n \n \nYeah, and the church records that money on their books and guess what!! on their financials statements too. \n\n \n Bad argument, removing a quote from context is dishonest. Four counts of fraud, one count of dishonest quote context. Your logic dictates that the church platter passeres are the same people as those who are donating. \n \n \nA transfer would imply an interfund transfer of money or other assets. Something from the Federal government to the state is normally called a \"grant\" or something like that.\n\n \n Not really. A grant is a specific fund from the fedreal gov't or state gov't for a specific reason, often with science based or education based rational. A transfer payment is a transfer of funds from the federals to the states. \n \n \nTransfer is like the state government general fund giving money to the Debt Service Fund to pay for interest on Bonds.\n\n \n transfer payments include money for roads, education, health, pension, etc, etc, etc. \n \n \nCollection would be recorded\n\n \n *sigh* only if it was relevenat. \n \n \nTo say donations came because of this is simply a guess\n\n \n Then explain why in every UN sanction action voluntary donars are abounded, but in every non-sanctioned action, there are few voluntary donars. Oh wait, you can't. \n \n Explain to me why several countries are not donating specifically because they said \"No UN sanction!\"\n \n Let's do the math.\n \n Four counts of fraud (in that last post ALONE)\n One count of dishonest quote context\n Several outright fabrications",

First off, expenditures are normally not on the government (or in this case UN) wide financial statements...they are expenses. Aside from that, a budget wouldn't show a donation from someone. The YMCA can't budget a donation they don't know is coming\n \n \nOn the contrary, the Iraq war has been running for several years. Not to mention that the build up for Operation Desert Storm took 6 months and went past a operating cycle. It would have been included in their next year's budget\nI thougth we were talking about the Gulf War and not the Iraq war now..but whatever. As for the war being put on their budget...no it wouldn't because they never paid for it. Not only that...it is unlikely that the UN even does a full budget beyond there normal activities. \n \n \nit would be non-sense to say that such expenditures wouldn't have been on their budget while they paid for it. Do you really have a accounting degree? \n \n You don't...I do...so you are just talking out your (you know). An expenditure doesn't have to be on the budget. An example is a lawsuit that suddenly came up and they have to pay something. This would be an expense (not expenditure) for claims and judgement. Well actually, depending on how they do there accounting it might be an expenditure..either way...that is an example.\n \n \nIf the UN paid for such actions, often spanning several years, the money would have been allocated in their budget. Problem is that didn't occur. \nHA, you need to learn the idea behind a budget...it may appear it may not. The Iraq War didn't appear in the US budget the first year we went to war as I recall.\n \n \nDo you know what a budget is? It wouldn't be on their financial statement if they paid for it as the money would not have come from a UN related account. \n \n This makes no sense. You ask me what a budget is..I do know. If the UN paid for something it would show up on their financial statements...so yeah..what are you saying?\n \n \nWhile you clearly ignore the fact that you were the first one who talked about the budget in relations to payments.\nWhere did I say that? NO WHERE. I said even if you used the entire budget of the UN you couldn't pay for the war. I gave an example of someone saying something like this--<\"All the money in fort knox coudln't pay for my house\"..something like that.\n \n \nAnd we are telling you the money doesn't come from the budget. wow are you really that dense? seriously, how hard is this to understand? \n \nNO DUH MONEY DOESN'T COME FROM THE BUDGET...WOW, this is sad man. I don't know how to make it any clearer...I was saying in that post that if you took all of the money that the UN budgeted (in other words, 2.1 billion dollars) you couldn't pay for the Gulf War. I could have said \"If you took all of the UN's money and put it all towards the Gulf War then you couldn't pay for the Gulf War\"....How is that hard to understand. The point I was making is that there was NO way the UN could pay for the Gulf War. Seriously now.\n \n \nOh, you lie\n http://4forums.com/political/showpo...69&postcount=20\n http://4forums.com/political/showpo...21&postcount=23\n \nSilly Duo, see the above statement.\n \n \nMore lies. I never said the Un paid for the war. How does it feel to be a liar? \nlol, you are borderline being reported to the admin for calling peopel liars. A liar isomeone that knows they are telling false information. My information is not false. You said the UN collected money to pay for the war....thus the UN paid for the war. You have many quotes to show this including your \"pass the hat\" statements.\n \n \nI ask you again, why would the UN record money it never touches and is not revelant? You seem to keep avoiding that like the plague. Oh yes, because if you answered, you'd instantly prove your claims wrong. \n \nI try not to call people names but you are pushing it. If the UN colleted money it is reported on the UN books and thus UN financial statements. I am sorry you don't like this but that is the way governmetnal accounting works.\n \n \nBad analogy. The money collected from another government is revelant towards the collector. The money that is given to the leading country from the UN asking for donations is not revelant towards the UN's finances. THis is seriously funny, considering how you keep avoiding the questions as well as revelancy of the money in regards to statements.\n \nIt was an example not an analogy but whatever. You were saying that the money is not relevant to the UN so why would they record it. I am saying that if the UN collected the money they would report it even if they were just giving it to another country. This is like a government collecting for another government. If your county collects taxes for the state it can't use that tax money for anything, it just passes it along to the state. Thus it is irrelevant to the collecting county. However, the county will report that the collected taxes and the expenditure to the state.\n \n \nOn the contrary, I know that very well. What is amusing is that you think the UN would record activites is does not do. Seems rather stupid to me. Would a manufacturing company record any financing activities if it had none for the operating cycle? Or how about a fast food joint, do they record manfacturing activities? No. Because they don't do them. It is the same with the UN. They do not record activities they do not do. I would not hire you to be my accountant. \nAnother example of you not knowing anything about accounting. The UN has financing and investing activities and Daewoo pointed one out...escrow accounts. If a manufacturing company didn't have any financing activities then are probably going out of business tomorrow. I know of no company that has no investing or financing activities reported on their cash flow statement. In fact, after looking at the UN financial statements I can assure you they do have financing and investing activities. You probably don't really know what they are anyway so I will let you slide on this one.\n \n \nBad example. The company sees parts of the accounts recieveable. Not to mention if the materiality is high enough, they sue them to get their cash. They see the money. Also bad debt is from a sale. The UN conducts no such activities. You're comparing apples and oraganes. \nONce again you asked for an example not an analogy. And yes a company sees parts of the A/R..however they don't see parts of it too because it goes into Bad Debt Expense. Do they sue? Sometimes, but mostly it goes into an allowance and is written off the books later on. Thus they recorded money they never saw. Try again Duo CPA.\n \n \nBut the UN is not per se the normal government. IT does not collect taxes. It does not operate long term financing. It does not have selling expenses\nTrue, it is probably run more as a not for profit. Same rules apply.\n \n \nI don't read everything Daewoo posts\nMaybe so, however, you responded to the one where he said the UN paid for it.\n As I recall at the beginning we were talking about what would happen if the US pulled out of the UN..you said \"who would pay for our adventures\"...you then talk about the UN passing a hat which assumes collections and thus reported on books and thus expended out and thus the UN \"paying\" in a sense. Either way you look at it you are wrong. Maybe your comments were just poor and easily misunderstood and you really meant that other countries wouldn't pay for the adventures. However, giving you that, you still said the hat thing. This is also false and you can't deny you said that. \"Passing hat\" is a collection. No way around that one. Collection is ALWAYS recorded. Either way you look at it Duo..you messed up. Just be a man and admit it. I admitted I might have misunderstood what you were saying(although from the context it sure did seem you were saying the UN paid). \n \n \nHat passer and donater are two very different things. You've again ignored how my church passer analogy proves you oh so very wrong. Fallacy: selective reading. Three counts of fraud. \n \n\n Nope, you said hat passer in both...good try. HAHA you and your fake fallacy tracker. Funny man.\n \n \nThat is the textbook defition of accounting.\nNot my textbook. I gave you an 8/10 for being mostly right. Get over it.\n \n \n You are just too funny sometimes Duo. You don't know much about accounting and I don't expect you or many to. However, you have no grounds to think you know what you are talking about when it comes to budgets, financial statements, and the Cash Flow statement. I am not here to give you a lesson in any of these things so stop acting like you know what you are talking about because you make yourself look foolish. Accounting is not something you look up and understand and not something many people \"get\". In fact, there are many way to do accounting which make everything different. So unless you know what the UN does then you have no grounds to speak. Lucky for me, I read(in part) the UN financial statements from the gulf war and from 2003(maybe?). If you haven't taken advanced financial you wouldn't understand these much the same way I wouldn't understand engineering. Duo, I can't tell you how many times you screwed up when talking about accounting...everything from transfers to cash flow statements to budgets. All we need is for you to talk about leases and income taxes and you will have screwed everything up. You can't win an arguement if the person you are talking to is an expert and you are just guessing based on what you think. To be hoenst, some of the stuff I have to look back in my books to find out what it says. So I know I am right. You might have been right about not saying the \"UN paid for the Gulf War\" (eventhough it sure seemed that way) however you said they collected the money(aka passing the hat). They didn't....end of story. The UN doesn't collect money for a war nor does it pay for a war. We know the UN helps pay for relief effort..thats all. So just shut up like you know everything and stop wasting my time teaching you basic accounting.",

   "oops...missed a few things.\n \n \nNot really. A grant is a specific fund from the fedreal gov't or state gov't for a specific reason, often with science based or education based rational. A transfer payment is a transfer of funds from the federals to the states.\n\n \n No. I don't really know how to explain this to you...That is just not the case. A transfer is always inter government. I mean you can transfer between an enterprise fund and the general fund however that is still intergovernment. The federal government doesn't have \"transfers\" with the state governments as they are seperate. I guess we could get into the details of this...You adjust off transfers in and transfers out at the end of the year when you consolidate the fund statements and you couldn't do this if they weren't part of the government. Seriously..just stop you don't have a clue about what you are talking about.\n \n \n*sigh* only if it was relevenat. \n\n While referring to recording of collections. Duo, I am sorry, you just have to record them. If you collect you record...relavent has nothign to do with it. This is across the board for accounting. It is just the way it is man..why don't you get that. If you collect it you record it....Why are you argueing with someone that has an accounting degree and it is looking at it in his accounting book as I type this...I wanna pull my freakin hair out. Go buy the book \"Governmental and Nonprofiting accounting\" by Robert Freeman right now and LOOK IT UP.",

For once, can you pay attention? \n \n \nAs for the war being put on their budget...no it wouldn't because they never paid for it.\n\n \n Well, I never said they did. \n \n \nNot only that...it is unlikely that the UN even does a full budget beyond there normal activities.\n\n \n Wow, it took you that long to figure that out. At least you got there. \n \n \nYou don't...I do...so you are just talking out your (you know).\n\n \n I never said I did. I don't make up degrees in the hopes that it will help me in a argument. \n \n \n\n An expenditure doesn't have to be on the budget.\n\n \n It usually is if the issue in question is running for a long time, such as the decades long peacekeeping operation in Bosnia. Actually in that case, the UN might have actually paid for that through budgeting money for peacekeeping. The UN does budget money for such long term sanctioned events. \n \n \nAn example is a lawsuit that suddenly came up and they have to pay something.

I learned asking you anything doesn't get a answer. Why wouldn't it? After all, the budget for Bosnian peacekeeping was funded through the UN allocation for peacekeeping.

But Bosnia is a weird case, it's not the actual invasion. \n \n \nIf the UN paid for something it would show up on their financial statements...so yeah..what are you saying?\n\n \n FInally.

Better? \n \n \nMy information is not false. You said the UN collected money to pay for the war....thus the UN paid for the war.\n\n \n How so? Did they come up with the money? No. Did the money come from their budget? No. Who pays for it, the person who donates the money or the person who collects it?  The collector hasn't put one cent into the collection plate. How can they pay for something they have not donated to? \n The countries aren't donating to the UN, they are donating to the action. The money never touches any Un account, nor is it paid from there. How can the UN pay for something with money it doesn't have and money it never sends? For a accountant, you sure seem like a bad one. \n \n \nYou have many quotes to show this including your \"pass the hat\" statements.\n\n \n Who's money is in the hat, the passer or the donator?

They don't record it. HELLO. \n \n \nI am saying that if the UN collected the money they would report it even if they were just giving it to another country\n\n \n If it never touched their accounts or their hands, they wouldn't record it. You don't record another company's sales to a another company on your books. \n \n \n However, the county will report that the collected taxes and the expenditure to the state.\n\n \n Because the money is revelant to their finacial status.

The example doesn't work because you are trying to compare a instance where the money is not revelant to a istance where it is clearly is. \n \n \n\n Another example of you not knowing anything about accounting.\n\n \n Yeah, I don't know anything about financial accounting, managerial accounting, GAAP, cash vs accrual, bad debts, financing, operating activities, fasb, SEC, ledger accounts, general journal accounts, income summaries, permant vs temporary accounts, adjusted trial balances, debits & credits, T accounts, FOB, etc, etc etc. emoticon_rolleyes Try again. Assuming again aren't you? \n \n \nThe UN has financing and investing activities and Daewoo pointed one out...escrow accounts.\n\n \n Escrow is investing and financing? Escrow is a merely a account held by a third party to ensure neither side gets screwed. Escrow could be used to hold a sum of money that is being sent to purchase medical supplies for a UN relief mission. Does that sound like investing and financing? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nIf a manufacturing company didn't have any financing activities then are probably going out of business tomorrow.\n\n \n That isn't revelant. they would not record such activities if they did not do them. Fallacy: changing the subject. One count of fraud. \n \n \nIn fact, after looking at the UN financial statements I can assure you they do have financing and investing activities. You probably don't really know what they are anyway so I will let you slide on this one.\n\n \n that's a good one considering what you just classified as financing and investing. Pot calling the kettle black anyone? \n \n \n\n And yes a company sees parts of the A/R..however they don't see parts of it too because it goes into Bad Debt Expense. Do they sue? Sometimes, but mostly it goes into an allowance and is written off the books later on. Thus they recorded money they never saw. Try again Duo CPA.\n\n \n You're missing the point. The UN conducts NO SUCH ACTIVITIES \n The UN has no revenue, it has no accounts recieveable. It has no bad debt. Your example is bad because it doesn't allow for a comparision of revelant things. Guess you just bombed on your accounting eh? \n \n \n\n True, it is probably run more as a not for profit. Same rules apply.\n\n \n FInally, it doesn't have the same actitivies. It therefore does not record activities it does not engage in. How hard is this? \n \n \n\n As I recall at the beginning we were talking about what would happen if the US pulled out of the UN..you said \"who would pay for our adventures\"...you then talk about the UN passing a hat which assumes collections and thus reported on books and thus expended out and thus the UN \"paying\" in a sense.\n\n \n WHOA, there was no assumptions there by me at all. Only by you. If you wish to debate something you clearly made up, by all means, do so with the one who made the claim: YOU. \n \n \nEither way you look at it you are wrong. Maybe your comments were just poor and easily misunderstood and you really meant that other countries wouldn't pay for the adventures. However, giving you that, you still said the hat thing. This is also false and you can't deny you said that.\n\n \n Well, it was the best metaphor out there. Perhaps it isn't the best one you can understand.  \n \n \nI admitted I might have misunderstood what you were saying(although from the context it sure did seem you were saying the UN paid).\n\n \n I will admit that perhaps the metaphore used was beyond your ability to grasp. That by all means doesn't invalid my argument which has always revolved around the key pillar of legitmacy. \n \n \n\n Nope, you said hat passer in both...good try. HAHA you and your fake fallacy tracker. Funny man.\n\n \n Um no? Where did I say that the UN paid for it? I said that the UN was the litteral hat passer. Not the litteral donater. Two very differehtn things. \n \n \nNot my textbook. I gave you an 8/10 for being mostly right. Get over it.\n\n \n Try \"Financial Accounting, Information for decisions, 3rd Edition,\" Wild, J, John. \n \n \n\n You are just too funny sometimes Duo. You don't know much about accounting and I don't expect you or many to\n\n \n Considering how you keep jabbering about how you know so much yet prove nothing of the sort, you don't know much about accounting and I don't expect you or many to. \n \n \nHowever, you have no grounds to think you know what you are talking about when it comes to budgets, financial statements, and the Cash Flow statement\n\n \n What the hell does the cash flow statement have to do with this? Until you prove that you know something about accounting, you have no grounds to think you know what you are talking about when it comes to budgets, financial statements, and the Cash Flow statement. \n \n Btw: I noticed that you ignored that you clearly resorted to selective reading and raising the bar by attacking me for not defining specifically which part of accounting you wanted. Seems I know more then you think I do but you are unwilling to admit it. \n \n \nAccounting is not something you look up and understand and not something many people \"get\".\n\n \n Wow, if someone who clearly doesn't get it is saying that others don't get it, it must really be hard. \n \n \nIn fact, there are many way to do accounting which make everything different.\n\n \n Of course. Lifo, fifo, SI, WA all result in different COGS and different revenues. :) Not to mention cash and accural result in very differnt outcomes. \n \n \nIf you haven't taken advanced financial you wouldn't understand these much the same way I wouldn't understand engineering.\n\n \n Huh. It seems neither of us have read them considering what we have said. \n \n \nDuo, I can't tell you how many times you screwed up when talking about accounting...everything from transfers to cash flow statements to budgets.\n\n \n Sure you can. But I don't think you are actually a accountant at all. Not to mention you're basically making things up now as you're the one who brought up cash flow. I don't even know where that came from. I certainly didn't talk about it. Seems you'd rather fabricate arguments then actually deal with what I am saying. Not to mention you are seemigly moving towards fallacies now. As for transfer payments, please, tell me how i'm wrong.\n \n \nAll we need is for you to talk about leases and income taxes and you will have screwed everything up. \n\n \n Right. Sounds like you are just starting the more-righteous-then-thou instead of proving anything he says.\n \n \nYou can't win an arguement if the person you are talking to is an expert and you are just guessing based on what you think.\n\n \n Good point, We need to call a expert in. Neither of us are clearly the expert here. \n \n \nSo I know I am right.\n\n \n God told me i'm right. \n \n \nSo just shut up like you know everything and stop wasting my time teaching you basic accounting.\n\n \n Considering you've screwed up yourself, that;s quite a statement. \n \n I take it you cannot explain why Un sanctioned events have volutary donars and non-sanctied do not? \n \n I also take it that you admit to your fraud and dishonest behavior? \n \n Also I take it you drop your claims about my legitmacy argument?\n \n i see you ignored quite a large amount of my post. Especially the parts where I highlighted your errors in accounting. Also i see you ignored my transfer payments yet you call them wrong without any explantion.\n \n lol. you are amusing. When the going gets tough, act all high and mighty, say your opponent is wrong, ignore key parts and then pretend you win.\n \n So much for considering you smart.",

Learn that GAAP doesn't apply to the government too. HAHA too funny.\n \n \nEscrow is investing and financing? Escrow is a merely a account held by a third party to ensure neither side gets screwed. Escrow could be used to hold a sum of money that is being sent to purchase medical supplies for a UN relief mission. Does that sound like investing and financing? \nTo a non-accountant, no. To an accountant, yes. Probably because you don't know what cash flow statements are you would think that. Its ok though.

But who is counting right?\n \n \nTry \"Financial Accounting, Information for decisions, 3rd Edition,\" Wild, J, John. \n \n Yeah, and you got a financial accounting answer for what accounting is. Probably a nice intro book though, however, it doesn't go over cost accounting, governmental accounting, not for profit accounting, and I am guessing most financial accounting aspects.\n \n \nOf course. Lifo, fifo, SI, WA all result in different COGS and different revenues. Not to mention cash and accural result in very differnt outcomes. \nAwww, duo knows different ways to account for inventory. I wonder if he knows how to account for a change from LIFO to FIFO or the other way around. Not only that...I was talking about types of accounting like governmental and business accounting...two different ways to do it. \n \n \n But I don't think you are actually a accountant at all.

   " So you finally admit that you were wrong.\n\n \n Yep. I will admit I was wrong, inaccurate, whatever you wish. \n \n \nI believe the UN has many funds:) however I know what you mean so I won't get all technical on you.\n\n \n I am sure they do. I know they have a peacekeeping fud, that by some mental gymnastics as counted as operating costs. Not sure how they pulled that one off. \n \n \nAs I said, I don't know much about the escrow accounts used by the UN..however, Escrow accounts are normally used in lending situations or a few other odds and ends involving third party holders (I believe I mentioned one somewhere). However, if this is the case, once again the UN wouldn't have anything to do with money and even more proving my point that the UN didn't pay for the Gulf War. I take it that Chase manhattan would be the escrow agent and the UN would just help set up the terms?\n\n \n That is my understanding. They set up the account and solicit the donations, then it goes into the escrow account and (I believe) a person from the aid agency requesting funds, the governement of the nation where the funds are to be used, and whoever the UN has appointed or elected for oversight are required to approve any funds transfer out of the account. \n \n \n No more childish then you or Duo I guess. However, I wanted it to be known that the UN didn't pay for it. Accounting majors have to be accurate about this stuff...you understand :p\n\n \n Actually, I do. It is like talking to a damn lawyer.

A transfer payment consists of funds being moved from the federal government to the state governments. Such include medical funds, road funds (high ways are a huge transfer payment), education funding. The entire NCLB funding is a transfer payment. \n \n \nGood game Duo..You have offically lost the arguement. Depreciation is an expense but not an expenditure (as one example).

When would VA collect money from NC without putting into a account? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nYou don't know what modified accural is. You don't know what GASB is.\n\n \n Did I say I knew everything? No I didn't. Fallacy: Composition. Three counts of fraud. \n \n \nYOu dont know what Cash flow statements are.\n\n \n How does my questioning of how they play into this argument prove that I don't know what they are? That seems like a leap of judgement. Once again, I never said that I knew everything, I just countered that you said I knew nothing. Seems that your claim is once again false. \n \n \ntransfer to escrow account is a financing activity.\n\n \n Because...oh yes because you said so. Interesting how you ignored my example. fallacy: selective reading. Four counts of fraud. \n \n \nhehe, actually they do have revenue...membership fees.\n\n \n How is that revenue? Wrong term and you call yourself a accountant, notice how when you claim expertise any problem you make instantly looks bad on you. Revenue comes from the sale or service. The UN provides neither. \n \n \nANd they do have bad debt because some countries don't pay up.\n\n \n That's not the defintion bad debt. \n \n \nYeah, and you got a financial accounting answer for what accounting is\n\n \n But it is a textbook definition, which backs my point, which you claimed wasn't entirely correct. Therefore you are wrong. :p \n \n \nI wonder if he knows how to account for a change from LIFO to FIFO or the other way around.\n\n \n Once again, I never claimed I was a accounting expert.

   "Ah, so under such logic, you're lying when you said I know nothing about accounting yet all I had to do was to prove I knew one thing, since you didn't state an absolute. Interesting, you seem to do that a number of times, declaring my claims wrong merely because I did gave a general description when you wanted a specific one without telling anyone. While you jabber about how I didn't say always, you have no problem attacking me on not specificying when it was never asked. Ah, hypocracy. :p \n \n Besides, even if you're not a liar there, you're clearly a liar about the legitmacy claim you made. Interesting how you ignored how you were very wrong about that. Not to mention a whole other list of things. \n \n Transfer payments are outside the world of accounting. A transfer payment is something that consists of a transfer from a goverment to its states or its people. The vast majority, over 60% of the Federal budget is transfer payments in Medicare and Social security (which alone produce the majority of the expenses) coupled with education, road bills, unemplyoment insurance, etc, etc etc. \n \n Between Medicare, SS, net interest, and unempoylemt benefits, they consist of around $1.489 trillion of the $2.6 trillion budget. Therefore my claim about tranfer payments as the majority is correct. \n \n I'm annoyed that i didn't catch your act in the beginning. It's a clear selective reading. By attacking one portion you then delcare the whole thing is wrong. Nevermind that the fundemental argument was based upon legitmacy, which you never actually addressed. \n \n Until you do address the legitmacy point (which I made in my 2nd post to you, you have yet to disprove the claim. \n \n The fact that you have lied about the legitmacy claim, as well as othre specifics, not to mention your use of fraud is all beyond obvious. In fact the entire argument you ran was a fraudlent one. By picking ONE point out you intended to show the whole thing was wrong. \n \n You act in fraudlent ways, that is beyond all doubt. \n \n btw: if you say you go by exact defintions, why did you call late or no member fees \"bad debts\" when in such instances the term does not apply? :p",

   "You are funny Duo....are you admiting now that YOU lied? Or are you admitting that you were wrong about the expenditure = expense thing?\n\n \n Neither. I am merely saying that if we apply your logic, then certain outcomes occur. I never said I embraced that logic, I merely followed where it would lead. A sign of intelligence is the ability to toy with a concept without embracing it. \n \n \nIF you are trying to get me on saying \"you know nothing about accounting\" then why do you even bother arguing? You fail to look at context so many times.\n\n \n How so? You clearly stated that I knew nothing about accounting. Yet if that was true, I wouldn't know the difference between a income statement and balance sheet, not to mention I questioned how the cash flow statement was even relevant to the discussion. If I truly did not know anything, I wouldn't have made such comments. Context is quite irrevelant here. If i didn't know anything about accounting then I wouldn't have known what those terms meant to not to mention that managerial wasn't GAAP. Therefore your claim here and before is quite wrong and if we use your logic, you are therefore a fradulent hypocrite. It is really up to you if you wish to contiune using such logic. I never embraced it. \n \n \nHowever, I stand by my claim that you know nothing about accounting...you just think you do.\n\n \n Then according to your logic, LIFO, FIFO, GAAP and every term I mentioned about accounting is no longer part of accounting. Once again, is up to you if you wish to contiune using such logic. I definitely will not be the one to say that Managerial and financial accounting are not part of accounting. You may through, that is your decision. \n \n \nYou didn't know what an expenditure vs expense was, you didn't know how escrows work, you don't know how cash flow statements work (and what they show), so my only conclusion from that is.\n\n \n Again, more simplistic stupidity. I never stated that one was the other all of the time, which you clearly imply that I did. Also, I described what a escrow service was: a account which holds the funds to ensure neither side gets screwed. Is that not what escrow is? \n \n \nDocuments, real estate, money, or securities deposited with a neutral third party (the escrow agent) to be delivered upon fulfillment of certain conditions, as established in a written agreement.\n\n \n Ah, a account which prevents both sides from being screwed. \n http://www.investorwords.com/1747/escrow.html\n \n Oh such grounds your claim again is wrong. You never explained how the cash flow statement even is revelant to the discussion. Why I would talk about something completely irrevelant is beyond me. Such comments upon your part do not actually show anything besides your inherently use of the fallacy of changing the direction. Therefore your conclusion is biased, wrong and for the most part, based upon the fallacy of composition (as well as biased sample). Under such you are guilty of three counts of fraud as it stands in this post alone. \n \n \nyou know nothing about accounting. I know a few things about engineering, however, if someone said \"you know nothing about engineering\" I would say they are right because the vast majority of the stuff I don't know.\n\n \n Again, under your claims managerial, financial and GAAP (along with FASB) have nothing to do with accounting whatsoever. Please, contiune stating I know nothing about accounting, you keep removing parts of accounting that are vital to the entire industry when you say such inane things. Your comment is insane. How can you know nothing about engineering while knowing something about it at the same time? That is sheer idiocy. That would mean anyone who knows 50% about something knows nothing simply due to your logic. If we applied your logic to the rational world, no one knows anything as the vast majority of knowledge in every field has yet to be discovered. Let's apply this to history and the real world to show how incredibly stupid your comment was. \n \n The Ancient Greeks, they had basic mathetics and the base foundation for calculus. Yet they did not know about higher level calculus, lineral algebra, and other such fields of math. Under your logic, the ancient Greeks knew nothing about math at all. That is clearly ludacrious as they used math to prove that the Earth was round. \n \n Geneticists, the scientists working as we speak to unravel the knowledge of genetics. The field is very new, with new discoveries every day. We have barely even scratched the surface. They clearly do not understand the vast majority of the field, and therefore under your logic, they know nothing about genetics\n \n The computer nerd who builds his own computer. That would include me. I don't know how the parts are specifically made. I certainly don't know how to code. Not to mention I don't fully understand how some parts work. Not to mention that most software internals are beyond me. As such I don't know even 25% of the field. Under your logic I don't know anything about computers, yet I have built two from scratch, worked in a IT department and fix my friend's and family's computers. Not to mention that if you tell me a few things about your computer (mainly motherboard model #) I can litterally give you specifics as to what will run on your system, what isn't capatible, and what isn't worth the money, not to mention how to get the best out of your system for the cheapest investment. Yet you would clearly say (assuming you don't flip flop on your comment, which would make you a liar if you did) that I know nothing about computers.\n \n Once again, it is entirely up to you to use such insane and illogical thinking. \n \n \nEverything else you wrote down I do read by the way..so it is not selective reading.\n\n \n Then you are just fradulent. You clearly picked out one part of the argument and attempted to prove the rest of the argument wrong by proxy. That doesn't work. It is by definition the fallacy of selective reading. Four counts of fraud. \n \n \nHowever, some of us don't have time to refute every dumb claim you make.\n\n \n Or you just do not want to answer the hard questions. You still haven't commented upon the UN legitmacy which was the key part of my argument from the very beginning.\n \n \n If you would like me to address something specific just PM me and I will get to it when I can.\n\n \n Doubtful. Considering I have asked you in almost every post to explain the UN legitmacy part and you have failed every time, why would a history of failure on your part move me to try to ask a question I know you cannot answer? That would be a waste of time. \n \n Please dig your hole deeper. I'm offering you a chance to drop your insane illogical process and come back to rationality.",

You're still very much a fraud, not to mention a poster of really stupid comments. \n \n \n\n And everyone will believe someone that doesn't hold a degree in it over someone that does. Good luck Duo.\n\n \n When you declare that basically the SEC, FASB and GAAP has no part in accounting, who is going to trust you? Besides, I didn't say that those things weren't part of accounting. I stated that I knew about them and you said that I knew nothing. Therefore if I know nothing about it, those are not part of accounting. According to you, SEC, FASB and GAAP are no longer in any way shape or form part of accounting. \n \n \nDo you really want to be schooled in how escrow accounts are accounting for too? You are digging a bigger whole..However, if you want I will...It just helps me for the CPA exam.\n\n \n Why is it that you still haven't admited that you are wrong? I cited a defintion escrow that fit mine. Are you saying that defintion is wrong? :) \n Are you saying that a escrow account is NOT a account that holds a security/funds while waiting for the piece of property or intangible to trade hands before the security/fund is transfered? Are you really saying that what escrow does isn't what it does? \n \n \n\n No one is stoping you...\n\n \n I already used it aganist you. :) \n \n [qupte]\n The only reason I am posting on this now is for enjoyment of you looking like a fool.[/quote]\n \n Okay \"Know something, know nothing!\" I'm still laughing you made that comment. \n \n [quote]No one is reading this silly thread because it is childish..however, I like to look at it as entertaining.[/qupte]\n \n I find your fraud and inability to deal with the fact you're a hypocrite when you attack others for saying they are very entertaining. \n \n \nSo keep going oh wise one...tell me about more accounting stuff.\n\n \n Only if you keep saying more stupid things like \"you know nothing if you don't know the vast majority of it.\" \n \n So who sets the rules for financial accounting if FASB, GAAP and the SEC, as you say, are not a part of accounting at all?",

However, in my opinion, to say you know something about accounting means you have to atleast taken a real financing accounting class (not high school). If this is the case, you know a little.

Are you really saying that what escrow does isn't what it does? \n \n I believe the escrow thing came up because we were deciding if anything is shown on the UNs books (as the UN has escrow accounts). And the answer is yes...they are on the books and a transfer to a escrow account is a financing activity. An escrow account is just an account held by a third party (to be really basic about it). So your definition is a bit off. They are mostly used in real esate type deals which is why the UN using them was interesting. Never the less, it is like a savings account that you can't really touch yet you still own the assets in it. I will give a 7.5/10 on this quiz as you gave a specific example of an escrow account. \n \n \nSo who sets the rules for financial accounting if FASB, GAAP and the SEC, as you say, are not a part of accounting at all?\n Do you know how many rules GAAP has issued? zero...this is because they are not something that makes rules...they are the rules. GAAP is a combination of Congress rulings, SEC, FASB, APB, AICPA, and CAP i beleive in that order too. However, you simply asked who sets the rules...and there you go. Another lesson learned.",

However, in my opinion, to say you know something about accounting means you have to atleast taken a real financing accounting class (not high school).\n\n \n So you're changing your position? When someone says they know something about accounting, to prove that all they need to do is prove they know something about accounting. It's pretty simple. \n \n \nIf this is the case, you know a little.\n\n \n Then that contridicts your previous statement.

Would you say that all of the college dropouts don't KNOW anything about business while they are reeling in more money then most of America? Or how about Gates, who dropped out of college and never took high level computer engieneering. Under your logic, he doesn't KNOW anything about computers. :) Really, just stop.

   "Well, whatever the cost the UN does..the US plays 22% of it.\nActually, Steeeeve, UN peacekeeping operations are a separate matter from UN membership dues. For peacekeeping operations the U.S. bears a higher cost than the figure you indicate.\n \n Furthermore, the UN's peacekeeping operations are not funded by passing the hat and taking donations. In fact, all Member States are legally obliged to pay their share of peacekeeping costs under a complex formula. For many years the U.S. share of peacekeeping costs was more than 30%. In the mid-90s the U.S. Congress limited the amount the U.S. could pay to 25%. The UN continued to bill the U.S. at the higher assessment rate, leading to U.S. arrears. Finally in 2000, the UN member states agreed to change the assessment formula and lower the U.S. share of the peacekeeping budget over a 3-yr period to 27%.\n \n Despite media focus on UN peacekeeping failures -- Sinai in '67, Somalia in '92, Sbrenica-Bosnia in '93, Rwanda in '94, and the recent setback with the sexual exploitation scandal by peacekeepers in Congo -- the full story is one of mixed results, since there have been successes as well in Namibia, Mozambique, El Salvador, etc.\n \n While I don't really care for the UN General Assembly and it's bloated bureaucracy and unaccountability, I think a case can be made that the UN peacekeeping missions have done enough good to warrant the U.S. expenditure. The U.S. Government Accounting Office in 2002 reported that during the 6-yr period from FY1996-2001, total U.S. contributions to UN peacekeeping were $27.7 billion, of which only $3.5B were direct and $24.2B indirect.\n \n There are roughly 70,000 UN peacekeeping troops serving in more than dozen ongoing missions. Very few of them are U.S. soldiers, less than 1%.\n \n In considering whether UN peacekeeping is worthwhile and cost-effective, it's worth noting that total UN costs for peacekeeping operations since 1948 is about $35 billion.

The AU is modeled after the EU. It's main governing body is the Pan-African Parliament. The AU intervened militarily in Burundi in 2003, though its mission there was subsequently taken over by the UN peackeeping operation called ONUB. Last year the AU sent a small peacekeeping force to Darfur. The peacekeepers are poorly-funded and ill-equiped, but even so, the AU voted last week to more than triple their force to nearly 8000. The suffering in Darfur is immense, estimates of 10,000 a month dying, and with the UN Security Council still deadlocked on action, the AU's efforts should be welcomed, not belittled. \n \n As for ECOMOG, it has no relation to the AU.

I think it was the very next post.\n \n \nIf the intent was to amuse, I admit I did smile, though I rather suspect the intent was to faultfind and nitpick. Like when someone feels compelled to correct another's spelling or grammar. If one should feel so obliged as to correct another publicly, it would be wise to first make sure good that an error indeed had been made.\n \n Not only did Steeeeve not forget Japan and Germany, but his math is on the mark. Perhaps Maxwell next time should use a calculator to add three simple numbers -- 16, 16, and 4. As Maxwell's own reference clearly shows, the $36 billion figure is the correct one, as Steeeeve originally stated.\n\n I like Gator :)\n \n \nActually, most federal transfer payments do not go to the states but rather directly to individuals and businesses. Look at the federal budget, specifically the outlays. Compare total federal expenditures with the amount of transfer payments to the states. What do you find?\n \n It's certainly fair to say that the majority of federal outlays are for entitlement programs rather than discretionary spending. However, the largest of these entitlements, Social Security and Medicare, do not involve the states at all. They are exclusively federal programs, and the benefit payments are in fact disbursed by the U.S. treasury directly to the final recipient. Same with Medicare, which is accounted for by two trust funds that are special accounts within the U.S. Treasury.\n \n Total federal discretionary spending, including national defense, together with interest on the debt, is still less than the amount spent on entitlements and other mandatory outlays. There's no way for federal transfers to state government to account for the majority of federal spending.\n\n \n We don't call them transfers in accounting :p as a transfer would have to be intergovernmental. However, it seems no one likes accounting usage of words.",

   "blah blah blah, you have said the same things like 10 times now. You finally admitted you were wrong about the expense = expenditure thing. I guess I could say you know very little about accounting, in fact next to nothing...\n\n \n The thing I find funny is that you'd rather keep saying I know nothing then answer the questions and prove you're a hypocrite and very wrong at the same time. First of all, I knew you were wrong long before you admitted it. A sign of such is when you constantly avoided how specific parts of accounting worked, and when you did answer, you came out contridictionary. That was quite amusing. Yes I was using you for entertaiment. It's always intersting to try see someone weasel out of their claims, let them get close, and then close the door. :p \n \n \n\n however, I can't give you more that as it would be false. I only do this because you care so freakin much about me saying you know nothing about accounting.\n\n \n Actually I just wanted you to eat humble pie and admit your statement was quite errenous, and insane at the same time. \n \n \nYou are saying it is impossible to know nothing about something.\n\n \n No, I'm saying that it is impossible to know nothing about something while knowing something about it at the same time. hence, it is impossible to say bill knows nothing about apples when he knows they are a fruit, they are red, and they grow on trees. Sure, he doesn't know much about how they are produced, what they are made of, what types, what their densities are, where they are found, etc, etc, etc, but it is wrong to say Bill knows nothing about apples when he clearly does know something about it. Such is why your statement is insane, wrong and ignorant. \n \n \nWhich I suppose \"technically\" is true.\n\n \n If you wish, I might have to close the door on you again. \n \n \nHowever, you are being a XXXXX if you say this as it should be obvious to a rational person what it mean to say \"you know nothing about _____\". I guess we can only conclude one thing....\n\n \n Then I am acting no different then you are, it is just that I'm not making inhernetly contridiction statements and then trying to weasel out of them. If you can conclude one thing that is factual, then a absolute stating you know nothing is wrong. Absolutes cannot have exceptions. Knows something is a exception. In this specific case I have proven to know how different inventory systems work, how some of the rules are set, how a specific account works, which system is gaap, which is not, which is used for internal, which is for external, etc, etc. I have proven more then one thing therefore your absolutism claim is wrong on all counts. I'm having real fun with this. Rarely do I get to shread such a ridiculous claim. \n \n \n\n Not normally...\n\n \n Um YES. A escrow account is third party account where usually funds are held before property or the thing is question is transfered. It prevents the property owner from cheating the capital owner, and the capital owner from cheating the property owner. it ensures a \"fair\" transaction. that is by all means a defintion of what escrow is. \n \n \nThis is probably the dumbest question I have been asked all week. If most countries support a war (for example) then of course the UN will reflect that as the countries are the ones that vote in the UN...and countries that support are more likely to donate. IT is not the UN saying its ok that makes them support a war it is the support that makes the UN say its ok. seriously now emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n The security council, which is composed of a relative few members, a tiny portion of the rest of the UN often decides if the action is just or not and has the ability to send peacekeepers, the vote doesn't always go through the main body. UN legitmacy is granted through the Sec Council and donations follow. Your argument fails to address that basic problem.",
