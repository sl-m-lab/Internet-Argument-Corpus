The article looks at some ongoing work looking at littorina saxatilis, a sea snail, and how new species are appearing in certain localites. \n \n Luckly for my fingers there is an online version of this article:\n \n Evolution at a snail's pace: UoLR July 2004 \n \n \n While not very technical I thought this is of interest as it is an example of the a study looking at evolutionary mechanisms operating today where they can be directly studied.\n \n :xcensored emoticon_angry :xbanghead emoticon_xkill",
