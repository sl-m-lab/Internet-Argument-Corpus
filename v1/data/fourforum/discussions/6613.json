   "I think a certain degree of egotism stirs the Creationism vs. Evolution \"debate\". \n \n Evolutions get their rocks off feeling intellectually superior to creationists \n \n Creationists get their rocks off feeling that the evolutionists are going to hell\n \n With that being said..\n \n What is wrong with America today? Overseas, India and China are granting multitudes more degrees in science and technology than the United States... and in light of this, a large chunk of America is in favor of introducing \"intelligent design\" into the classroom. This takes an even larger dent out of my already shaky confidence in the direction of this country.\n \n Intelligent Design and Scientific Theory are COMPLETELY SEPARATE things. Some people need religion in their lives and they certainly are entitled to it. After school programs, prayer groups, bible study... its all dandy. But biology? It simple doesn't have a place there.\n \n One of the stone pillars of scientific theory is falsification. Scientific knowledge endures by proving things wrong. Have you ever seen an apple 'fall' upwards? Have you seen anything accelerate without an applied or internal force? No\n \n Nobody else has either; its never been documented, not once, NEVER. This is how science progresses. Its what we gather through millions and millions of falsification experiments (obviously more complicated than my examples). Science is an intricate, vast, quantitative, and beautiful undersanding of the world as we observe it. \n \n Most proponents of Creationism either blindly reject or simply cannot understand advanced science and mathematics. A huge chunk of Americans believe in creationism while less than 5% of American scientists believe the same. Coincidence? Hardly. It might be condescending, but its true.\n \n To all creationists, or better yet all Christians, I ask you this question:\n \n Imagine you were born on a remote island [lets say your parents were on a cruise ship and a tragic storm tossed you overboard (theoretical here folks)] The very person you are now -- your brain and body -- physically unchanged. The idea here is no religious doctrines are presented to you.\n \n What do you believe?\n \n The answer: Whats around you.\n \n Science is objective, it doesn't have a bias or an agenda. IT ASKS QUESTIONS RATHER THAN SUPPORTS IDEAS. There are over 400 of these established 'ideas' all over the world. What if you picked up a book on Hinduism or Buddism on that island? What makes your idea so special? What makes *you* so enlighted? \n \n You renounce god and you burn in hell. I know you're scared, but open up some books and free your mind for JC's sake.",

   "ok were supposed to believe in GOd and then believe in evolutin...\nActually, no one cares if you believe in god. That is your business since it is something that you take on faith without any evidence that it is true. And no one believes in \"evolutin\" [sic]. The theory of evolution is an explanation for observed facts that has been repeatedly tested. It is the best explanation that scientists have been able to formulate. It is based on evidence and not faith.\n \n the two dont mix..\nThat is a minority view held mostly by poor, undereducated, rural, southern fundamentalist christians in the U.S.\n \nyou believe God and ALL of what He says or you dont believe in any of it at all..\nBut first, you have to believe (on faith - no evidence) that you know what god said. And then you have to interpret that so that it is acceptable to you. Most people who use your same \"word of god\" believe all of it but understand what it says differently.\n \nand if i were on an isalnd i would ask myself how did these things get here? chance? probably not because when do two things happen exactly the same way..\nActually, we have a pretty good idea of how life populates islands. And yes, it is pretty much by chance that things get carried to islands by any of several means. Your question/statement about two things happening exactly the same way doesn't seem to make sense.\n \nlike trees for example if it poff out of nowhere got here... its just not possible!\nNo one but creationists claim that anything poofed out of nothing. Isn't that what creationists say? Why there is even a creationist magazine called \"Ex Nihilo.\" That means \"Out of Nothing.\" Isn't that what creationism says? That the universe was poofed into existance out of nothing essentially the same as it is today about 6,000 years ago?\n \nand as for evolving.. theres too much pardon my terms.. LOL XXXX!\nMy bet is that you don't understand even the basics of evolutionary theory. Perhaps that you were unaware that in recent years most creationists have admitted that evolution is a fact and just try to specify limits on what and how things are allowed to evolve.\n \ni mean come on whos stupid enogh to believe that theres not a sprititual realm..\nThat's irrelevant. It doesn't matter whether or not there is a spiritual realm. Science doesn't deal with the supernatural because science is a naturalistic process. And until you can present some empirical evidence for your spiritual realm, it will remain irrelevant.\n \nand maybe just maybe God is whispering in your ear everyso ofetn and saying come on be smart! think about it! evolution cant prove it itself other than wrong! emoticon_xchicken emoticon_xchicken emoticon_xchicken\nI've never known anyone who has actually heard god.
