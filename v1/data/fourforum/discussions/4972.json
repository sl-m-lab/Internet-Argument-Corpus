   "I know this forum is mainly for Europeans to talk european stuff, but I am curious and this is the place for it.\n \n So, since Blair is very much for the Iraq war is this enough for Republicans to support him?\n \n Mind you the Conservative Party in England knows and repeats that Blair lied to go to war in Iraq, just as the Democrats did to Bush in the US.\n \n Also, Blair believes in a universal healthcare system, extremely tight gun control, and he played a key role in introducing Britain's first ever minimum-wage.\n \n So should US republicans want him in power again just because he's buddies with Bush?\n \n I'm sure it doesn't matter to you if Brit's have gun control and high corporate taxes, but does it matter that the Conservatives in England, whom I suppose you agree with on most points, believe that the war in Iraq was for a lie?\n \n Doesn't this make it seem foolish to call people who were against the war liberals simply because the know that Bush lied to take us to war along with Blair?\n \n What say you?",
