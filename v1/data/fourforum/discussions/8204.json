   "I've heard that representative of EU's Institution for Caucasian Security Studies visited Abkhazian autonomy not long ago. That's republic situated in North Caucasus. And Russia contests it against Georgia. But our European representative concluded that Abkhazian entry into Russian Federation is unacceptable and joining Georgia certainly has no prospects. Of course there wouldn't be any different conclusions. Georgia permanently infringes upon rights of autonomies closing schools, forbidding speaking their native languages and provoking intestine strifes. Also Georgian economical situation is much worse than Abkhazian one. So there is no sense for Abkhazians to join with Georgia.\n I would suggest to proclaim Abkhazian independence. That would be very profitable for Europe. We could make this country free trade area. USA gained too much influence there. And it is time for EU to strengthen our positions in Caucasian region. Why shouldn't we start from Abkhazia? But we should act quickly or Yankees would leave us behind again.",
