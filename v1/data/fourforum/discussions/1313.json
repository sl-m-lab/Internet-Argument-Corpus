Especially with how many foreign alliances we have today. \n \n However, I will concede that it may be possible for the US to start the third world war. This is how I think that could happen.

   "hmmmm... if its not the US starting a war, then the senario of somebody striking Israel is a pretty close second. the other plausible senarios all involve America picking on somebody.

Once the US get to a point where their army is stretched to thin, another country, say....North Korea for example, will invade South Korea, and the US will intervene. Then, maybe, China will invade Taiwan. And later, if the US tries to intervene in that, China's mutual agreement with Russia (which is an alliance where if one country is attacked, they other will help) will draw Russia in.

Also, you see on the news how they use bull dozers to demolish \"alleged terrorist\" homes and at the same time \"accidently\" killing innocent Palistinian civilians.\n\n \n Thank you for you reply! The conflict between Isrealies and Arabs is a complicated and deep issue. I apologize for the extreme length of my reply, but I think it has a lot of vital arguments and information. I wish you could see this issue exactly the way I see it, and see the people of Isreal as noble, courageous, and - above all - willing to make sacrifices for peace; and see the Palestinians as unfortunate people who have been lied to and used as pawns by hate-filled, uncompromising terrorists in order to fulfill their own agendas. Whether you do or not, I hope that you will read what I have to say, and what I have linked to, with an open mind and see that the issue is far too complex to see Isrealies as what the media has unfortunately protrayed them to be. \n \n If you read nothing else in this rely, please read this article, which covers much of the history of the conflict and clears up the issue of whether the west bank and gaza strip are occupied territories which once belonged to the Arabs: http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH0n1m0\n \n \n Terrorists:\n (from http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1991to_now_alaqsa_casualties.php)\n \n Who is responsible for the civilian casualties during the intifada?\n \n Aftermath of Terrorist Bomb Blast in Coffee Shop\n \n Since its start on September 29, 2000, Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) have been engaged in an ongoing violent confrontation, a sequel to the first intifada that lasted from approximately 1988 to 1992.\n \n The Palestinian Arab leadership, in a classic case of bad faith, accuses Israel of committing human rights violations for civilian fatalities among the Palestinian Arabs, especially children, while evading its own responsibility for orchestrating the conflict and inflicting massive, intentionally targeted civilian casualties on the Israelis. This constitutes a cynical exploitation of human rights concerns while deflecting attention from the murderous conduct of the Palestinian terrorists. Unfortunately, with media complicity, this propaganda has found a sympathetic audience around the world.\n \n There is often concern about the greater number of Palestinian Arabs killed as opposed to Israelis lost to terrorism. This disparity is used to \"justify\" additional terrorism against Israel -- the refrain goes: \"The brutal Israelis are killing so many of our people, what do you expect when our desperate youth become suicide bombers?\" This line of thinking is ignorant of the facts. The Israelis killed by terrorists, especially the suicide bombers, are almost all innocent civilians in public places, on the bus, or involved in religious services. The Palestinians killed are armed fighters, killed in the terrorist act itself or killed as they fire their guns at Israeli forces coming to arrest them. There are innocent Palestinian Arabs killed, an unfortunate truth, but they must be counted among the victims of Palestinian Arab terrorism too. The \"collateral damage\" of defensive military or police operations by Israel is the responsibility of the terrorist instigators, not with those who strive to eliminate the terror.\n \n Furthermore, the \"desperate youth\" who decides to become a suicide bomber, is armed, trained, and dispatched by cold-blooded, experienced terrorist teams. These acts are not the spontaneous outbursts of individuals, who would have no access to the sophisticated explosives and triggering devices, but are part of a military campaign orchestrated from the top.\n \n Use of Children\n \n Media reports often highlight instances in which Palestinian children have been killed or injured by Israeli troops or policemen and these reports have generated much criticism of Israeli policies. But, the appearance of Palestinian children in riots or other dangerous situations, is not accidental. The Palestinian Authority has intentionally mobilized Palestinian children to man the front line as a tool in its struggle against Israel, frequently using them as shields to protect Palestinian gunmen. This mobilization of Palestinian youth has been facilitated by the long-term impact of Palestinian Authority curricula, government-controlled media, and summer camp programs, which indoctrinate the youth for armed confrontation with Israel.\n \n The media visuals of a bleeding Palestinian child surrounded by screaming relatives are too powerful to permit most people to pause to consider why and how the child was in harm's way. One of the best known examples was the tragic death of Mohammed Al-Dura, the twelve-year-old from Gaza who was shot dead in his father's arms while cameramen filmed it. This ghastly event mobilized sentiment around the world to condemn Israel for using excessive force, even though there are many questions about how the child came to be in that place, how the media happened to be ready to film the event, and who fired the fatal shots.\n \n \n The standard tactic is to use children as bait, burning tires and shooting slingshots, to attract the television cameras and distract the IDF. At the same time, well-armed Palestinian gunmen in ambush positions are ready to shoot at Israeli targets. Since the Palestinian public knows that Israeli soldiers are ordered not to shoot live ammunition at children, the children act as shields to protect Palestinian snipers who shoot to kill any exposed members of the IDF. When the youths rush forward throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, Palestinian snipers on rooftops and in alleys take aim at the IDF. On some occasions Palestinian Arabs have shot children from behind, a fact that seldom makes it into media reports of the incidents. According to IDF sources, Palestinian gunmen have also fired shots from within a rioting crowd of civilians.\n \n Use of Red Crescent Ambulances\n \n Arab Red Crescent ambulances that wait to pick up the injured often serve a secondary role, a role that is illegal under international law. They have been photographed as they transport gunmen, Molotov cocktails, and rocks to confrontation locations, secure in the knowledge that Israel will not fire on these \"medical vehicles.\" Such use is a clear violation of one of the fundamental precepts of humanitarian law and places at risk the immunity generally granted to medical services. When Israel's IDF or police are forced to act against one of these disguised military vehicles, the usual \"world opinion\" reaction is to condemn firing on an ambulance, giving misguided license to the Palestinian Arabs to continue the practice.\n \n An example of the problem is this excerpt, from an IDF action report on July 13, 2001:\n \n During the exchange of fire, IDF forces identified two Red Crescent ambulances that arrived at the spot. Two armed gunmen emerged from the ambulance and proceeded to also open fire toward the IDF and Border Police forces.\n \n IDF Discipline Regarding Civilian Casualties\n When civilian casualties result from Israeli military action, the IDF has a procedure to investigate, make a determination of facts, and then to discipline soldiers and officers who are found to have violated rules of engagement. For example:\n \n The findings of the inquiry of the event in which a Palestinian boy was killed on the balcony of his home in the village of Nazlat Zid in Samaria, on October 4, 2002, were presented to the IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Moshe Ya'alon.\n \n \n According to the inquiry, an IDF force entered the village that day in order to enforce the curfew imposed on the village. Stone throwing and disturbances by village residents accompanied the entry. The IDF force acted to restore order, during which a Palestinian boy was wounded while standing on the balcony of his home. The boy later died of his wounds.\n \n \n The findings of the inquiry show that the deputy battalion commander was dismissed from his post following his actions, and will not be reinstated to a command post for at least three years, and then only if approved by the IDF Chief of Staff. [IDF Spokesperson's office, November 6, 2002] \n Although anti-Israel commentators will claim that Israel and the IDF are brutal and \"don't care about Palestinian deaths\" in fact any breach of military discipline or occurance of civilian casualties in the course of military operations is taken very seriously, will trigger a formal investigation, and can result in imprisonment of those involved. Even looting, without injuries, is considered very serious:\n \n During IDF activity in Jenin, an IDF soldier stole a sum of money from the local residents. Once the commanders of the soldier became aware of this, the money was immediately returned to its owners. The soldier was tried and sentenced to 28 days imprisonment at the end of which he will be expelled from the unit in which he serves. [IDF Spokesperson's office, November 4, 2002] \n\n \n I hope that you agree with me that Isreal's large military spending is justified and necessary for self-defense, and I hope that you agree with me that there are two sides to this story.Thanks for reading this.",

   "-sigh- How many times has some windows bug erased everything in the middle of one of my posts? ... okay, maybe 2 or 3. Still, its a hard life! \n \n \nemoticon_love \n \n I personally don't think occupying Palistinian refugee camps is considered self-defence. The Israelis have been occupying numerous Palistinian and Arab areas. I will not pretend I know all the occupied territories but I must say that this might be why Israel is so hated around the Middle East. Their occupations of Arab territory justified by their accusations of being some poor weak country that has must fend for themselves.... if they Israelis would except an independant Palistinian state and leave most if not all occupied territories, than they would at least have more support from the international community. \n\n \n I would say that these are the strongest arguements against Isreal (except media coverage of civilian deaths). However...\n \n You say that Isreal's \"occupations of Arab territory\" is a possible reason they are hated by Arabs. However it just isn't true that Isreal is occupying Arab territory.\n \n The history of the reigon goes like this: The Ottoman Empire owned it, and then the British took it in WWI. The British wanted to get out, and left it up to the UN to decide what to do with it. The UN proposed giving some of the land to the jewish people as the state of Isreal, and the rest would make up a Palestinian state. \n (map here: http://christianactionforisrael.org/images/1947.jpg )\n \n However, the Arabs refused to recognize these borders. Shortly after Isreal was created, the Arab nations attacked. (Isreal defeated them somehow!) During the Arab invasion, they occupied West Bank and the Gaza strip.\n \n Later, Isreal was again attacked in the six day war. They defeated the Arabians, and took back the West Bank and Gaza strip.\n \n \n On 10 June 1967, at the end of six days of fierce fighting ... a cease-fire was reached. Previous cease-fire lines were now replaced by new ones - the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula and a large part of the Golan Heights had come under Israel's control as a result of the war. Syria could no longer use the Golan Heights to launch artillery bombardments on Israeli homes below. The passage of ships to Israel through the Straits of Tiran was ensured. Israel now had defensible borders, and the imminent threat to its very existence was no longer.... Israelis believed that a new era was beginning, one that would bring peace to the region. Hoping to translate military gains into a permanent peace, Israel sent out a clear message that it would exchange almost all the territory gained in the war for peace with its neighbors.\n \n Furthermore, Israel gave strong indications of its deep desire to negotiate a solution, including through territorial compromise, by deciding not to annex the West Bank or Gaza Strip. This is important evidence of Israel's intent given both the strategic depth these areas offered and the Jewish people's age-old ties to numerous religious and historical sites, especially in the West Bank.... But Israel's hope for peace was quickly dashed. The Arab states began to rearm and, at the August 1967 Arab League meeting in the Sudan, adopted as their political position \"the three nos,\" principles by which the Arab states were to abide, namely, \"no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it.\" The Khartoum Summit's hard-line position forestalled all chances for peace for years. As Israel's then Foreign Minister Abba Eban said, \"This is the first war in history which has ended with the victors suing for peace and the vanquished calling for unconditional surrender.\" \n\n ( http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH0n1m0 )\n \n As for the refugee camps, that is less clear cut. They are a source of suicide bombers. The Arab nations keep the palestinians in ridiculous conditions - \n \n The so called Palestinian refugee camps are the ghettos of the Middle East. \n Every Muslim government that have these camps have stripped the civil and \n economic rights of all Palestinians and treat them as scum. The best example \n is Lebanon where Palestinians are forced to live in seventeen ghettos and are \n stripped of even the right of repairing their homes. If a toilet breaks in a \n Palistinian house in Lebanon, any Palestinian that tries to repair or replace \n a broken toilet risks being tortured and imprisoned by the Lebanese \n government. 117 professions in Lebanon such as doctor, lawyer, engineer, and \n architect are denied to Palestinians and they are only allowed to do manual \n labor. Every Muslim must rise up and demand equal civil and political rights \n for Palestinians as fellow Muslims. It is pathetic that only in the \n Palestinian Authority, the United States, and ISRAEL are Palestinians given \n equal economic and civil rights.\n \n \n ( http://www.dwcw.org/cgi/wwwbbs.cgi?Palestine&106 )\n \n Such conditions cause a lot of anger, and the Palestinians are told to blame Isreal. The Arab states use the refugees as pawns - keeping them in sqalor as political leverage against Isreal, and to increase hatred of Isreal among Arabians. \n \n The use of civilian shields and the use of refugee camps by the terrorists must be carefully considered when civilian deaths happen from Isreali action. \n \n \n You hear about the American \"Axis of Evil\" with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. If it wasn't for the wealth of Israel, they too would be on that ominous list of \"terrorist states.\" Israel has it's own nuclear arsenal, a huge army, and a large annual spending on military hardware. And for such a small country, that's quite scary. Plus, their history has not exactly been peaceful.\n \n Now, that said, I pray for peace in the Middle East.

Lets hope to have less of this emoticon_xkill and more of this emoticon_love but of course, that would need a lot more co-operation. I don't think the Americans are the right candidate for a referee, they seem a little biased and preoccupied with Iraq right now.\n\n \n There are certain differences between Isreal and the Arabian states. Isreal is a democracy, none of the Arab states are. That is the biggest difference, right there. Isreal's Arab press is the most vibrant in the middle east because of the freedom of press in Isreal! Isreal has been invaded several times. They did the invading one time, I believe, into Egyptian controlled territory. (and have since given back all land taken in peace treaties) \n \n Saying Isreal has a violent past is true. It wasn't their fault. They were invaded. I note that the list is of 'terrorist states'. Isreal doesn't support terrorists. They fight terrorists to defend their people. The Arab states do support or ignore terrorism. It is completely foolish to think Isreal would be on the 'Axis of Evil' list if they weren't wealthy. There are light-years of difference between Isreal and the Arab states.\n \n I do agree that Isreal isn't perfect. However, I would say that they have taken the moral high ground more than any other nation perhaps in the history of the world. They have been willing, and are likely to continue to be willing to allow for a Palestinian state - even though there is really no justification for it. I don't see it happening, but who knows?\n \n (p.s. -why the distiction between calling the Palestinian fighters militants or terrorists?)",

   "I would disagree with who is to blame when it comes to civilian deaths in the Israeli conflict. Any time you use military troops against civilians, or use military troops and tactics in a civilian area, YOU are responsible for the outcome.

The state of palestine was re-instituted at the same time that the sate of israel was created for the jews. If Palestines statehood is a matter ofr argument, so is that of Israel.\n \n As far as the US being blamed for WWIII, I think that is because we lately have this nasty habit of sticking our noses in other peoples buisness.

However, I believe that the Mossad is at least one of the best intelligence organizations in the world. It seems very clear that Isreal would do it's upmost to avoid attacking the wrong targets, partially to avoid wasting weapons and especially to avoid bad press. (I mention the waste of weapons, since the Isreali fighter pilots in one war would often not even shoot bullets at the enemy fighters, simply following them closely until the poorly-trained Arab pilots blacked out from attempting to get away)\n \n Are you saying that they should say where they are attacking and why before they make an attack?

Any time you use military troops against civilians, or use military troops and tactics in a civilian area, YOU are responsible for the outcome.\n \n \n I don't agree that the Isreali military is at fault. First, the Isrealies don't target civilians, they are targeting the militants who are hiding amoung the civilians. It is the militants who are starting the conflicts - they are the aggressors. Also, the Isrealies take civilian causualties very seriously:\n \n \nWhen civilian casualties result from Israeli military action, the IDF has a procedure to investigate, make a determination of facts, and then to discipline soldiers and officers who are found to have violated rules of engagement. For example:\n \n The findings of the inquiry of the event in which a Palestinian boy was killed on the balcony of his home in the village of Nazlat Zid in Samaria, on October 4, 2002, were presented to the IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Moshe Ya'alon.\n \n According to the inquiry, an IDF force entered the village that day in order to enforce the curfew imposed on the village. Stone throwing and disturbances by village residents accompanied the entry. The IDF force acted to restore order, during which a Palestinian boy was wounded while standing on the balcony of his home. The boy later died of his wounds.\n \n The findings of the inquiry show that the deputy battalion commander was dismissed from his post following his actions, and will not be reinstated to a command post for at least three years, and then only if approved by the IDF Chief of Staff. [IDF Spokesperson's office, November 6, 2002] \n Although anti-Israel commentators will claim that Israel and the IDF are brutal and \"don't care about Palestinian deaths\" in fact any breach of military discipline or occurance of civilian casualties in the course of military operations is taken very seriously, will trigger a formal investigation, and can result in imprisonment of those involved. Even looting, without injuries, is considered very serious:\n\n (from http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_19..._casualties.php) \n \n \nYou are entirely right about palestine being part of the ottoman empire (it was still palestine, though).

   " Where is this village and what gives the IDF the right to impose any curfew on the inhabitants of this village? \n\n \n Nazlat Zid in Samaria, on October 4, 2002. The curfews are an attempt to limit terrorist/militant activity, however, I don't agree with the curfew. It can only increase hatred towards Israel.\n \n \n Well if Israel is considered an independant state, then it should recongnize Palistine as a state as well.\n\n \n They most certainly would if the Arabs had recognized their own state in 1948. The Arabs refused, and that's why Palestine is not yet a state. I agree that a Palestinian state is crucial. Many times, Israel has offered large amounts of territory, but people such as Arafat have refused. The reason that negotiations have not moved in the past few years is that Isreal sees no effort from the Palestinian Authority to eliminate terrorist organizations.",
