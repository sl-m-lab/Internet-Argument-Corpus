   "You liberals that voted in favor of allowing a PBA read and heed:\n \n http://groups.msn.com/Proliferswillprevail/thetragedyofpartialbirthabortion.msnw\n \n ARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION\n WHAT IS IT?\n \n Partial Birth Abortion (PBA) or Dialation and extraction, is a legal tragedy. It is considered a medical procedure. This procedure takes three days to complete. The first two days are used to dilate the cervix. This procedure is extremely painful, no anthestisia is used for the baby. Medical experts agree that babies at this age (usually 5 months or more), experience great pain. The anesthesia given to the \"mother\" has little or no effect on the baby (Pres. of American Society of Anesthesiologists). During PBA's the \"mother's\" cervix is dialated and guided by ultrasound the abortionist grabs the baby's leg with forceps. Pulling the baby down the birth canal. The head remains inside the \"mother\". The murdering abortionist then jams scissors in the base of the skull. A catheter is inserted and the child's brain is the sucked out. The head then contracts allowing it to be removed more easily and sparing the \"mother\" of any damage. The difference between murder and abortion (legal murder) is a mere few inches. It appears that murdering the baby isn't enough, they need to torture it also.\n \n PBA is never medically necessary. It is a medical fact that PBA is in no way necessary to preserve the life of the mother. A committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, (ACOG)thoroughly studied PBA's in 1996. They reported, \"A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.\" \n \n HOW OFTEN IS IT PERFORMED?\n It has been reported that PBA's only account for 1% of all abortions. This has been disproved. Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted that current estimates are between 3 and 5 thousand annually.\n Ron Fitzsimmons is also quoted as saying that PBA's are performed on healthy fetuses.\n \n WHY IS THIS PROCEDURE PERFORMED?\n The claim that PBA's are used only or mostly in unusual medical circumstances was disproved by reporters for the Hackensack Record and the Washington Post, among others. These reporters interviewed numerous abortionists, who readily acknowledged that they routinely used this method for purely elective abortions. It is speculated that some women who recieve PBA's do so, because they have been in denial about the pregnancy and do not seek an abortion until she can no longer hide the pregnancy. Also, PBA's are performed when the results of an amniocentisis indicates a genetic or physical defect. In the majority of cases, PBA's are done for elective reasons. It is also suspected that these abortions are performed, in order, to do medical testing on fetal brains and/or aborted babies.\n \n MY PERSONAL FEELINGS\n I, in no way support any form of murder or abortion. I especially detest Partial Birth Abortion. It is cruel and should be considered infanticide. In some cases, if the woman decided half way through this horrible procedure, not to go through with the murdering of the baby, this baby could live. This procedure is performed on viable infants. Viable meaning able to live outside of the womb. I understand that there are some medical circumstances that require a woman to deliver early, but there is no excuse for this. These woman could easily choose an early induction and give a baby a fighting chance.\n \n HISTORY OF PBA\n Dr. Martin Haskell pioneered this technique after the late Dr. James Mcmahon. Dr. Mcmahon who developed this procedure said that of the 2,000+ PBA's that he performed, only 9% were for any maternal health reasons. Of that 9%, the most common indication was depression. Futhermore, he stated that 80% of abortions he had performed after 21 weeks were \"nonelective.\" However, he included as nonelective: depression, pediatric indications(ie the mother's youth), and a variety of fetal or maternal health problems that aren't life threatening. In other words, because of the vague definintion of \"health\" exceptions stated in late-term abortion laws, it was used to justify any reason for having such an abortion.\n \n Why is it that only a small number of abortionists, perform PBA's? Granted many may not have the proper training, although I am certain that it could be obtained. But it is my feeling that even these abortionists can't stomach this torturous procedure. I find it difficult to believe that they do not perform it for any other reason. We all know that abortion is big business, PBA's are especially profitable. The average PBA costs between $1200-$1500.",
