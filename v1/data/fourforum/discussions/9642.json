   "Blogs: Air America now extends debate invitation to conservative candidates ..\n \n \"Tweaking the Fox News Channel, the president of liberal Air America Radio this morning sent a letter to the chairmen of four state Republican parties, offering to host and broadcast the state parties' upcoming presidential debates.\n \n Agreeing to the debate \"would allow Republicans to differentiate themselves from Democrats,\" Air America President Mark Green wrote to the Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and South Carolina Republican chairmen in a deadpan communication provided this morning to The Politico.\"\n \n \"Why us? First, this would allow your debate to reach many voters. Combining our 2 million radio audience, along with our satellite, internet and web audiences, means that some 2.5 million Americans would hear or read about the debate..\n \n Second, it would allow Republicans to differentiate themselves from Democrats - embracing a debate hosted by a progressive media outlet after Nevada Democrats canceled a debate scheduled to be hosted by the conservative Fox Cable News Channel. The MoveOn organization spurred 265,000 people to complain about the original plan, calling Fox a \"mouthpiece for the Republican Party.\" In reply, Fox's Mort Kondracke called the Nevada Democratic Party's rejection of Fox a \"Stalinist\" violation of \"free speech and free debate.\" So should you accept Air America's offer, Republicans would both embrace free debate and stick it to Stalin at the same time.\n \n Third, our offer permits you to include any other national media company as a co-host -- like Fox. For example, a panel with Fox representing the conservative viewpoint and Air America the progressive viewpoint would make for a very \"fair and balanced\" debate -- not to mention that Fox's viewers per evening are coincidentally comparable to our 2.5 million listeners, meaning that several million unique people would hear your debate (assuming next to no overlap between our two disparate audiences).\" (http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0307/Air_Americas_Invitation.html) \n If this is all correct, it is interesting that Air American actually thinks it represents the left (progressive) rather than the far left. A more accurate right versus left debate would be simply Fox commentators (as the right) and some other mainstream news source like CBS, as the left. Air American doesn't report mainstream non-political news as Fox does; they are simply a political issue outlet. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but it's like comparing apples and oranges.",

   "I don't think there is any question that Fox is blatantly biased. I think the only real question is whether they can be taken seriously at all.\n \n I don't blame Fox for this, though. Like every other network, they are running a business. Somebody in a marketing department recognized that there were enough people in the US who were interested in seeing news with a right wing slant to it (if you can call it \"news\") to support a network...and fox news was born.\n \n Personally, I think maybe they swung a little too far into lala land. NOBODY takes them seriously anymore. I visit several formal debate boards, and on all of them quoting Fox is pretty much taboo not because there is a libearl bias to the boards, but becuase most of the stuff that FOX puts out is neocon or neofascist BS and is easily debunked. They simply do not report news accuratly so citing them as a source in a debate is likely to cost you points when your opponent smashes your source.\n \n From a practical standpoint, up until fox news showed up with their unabashed bias, I think that any kind of organized mdia bias was a myth, and certainly any concept of a \"liberal\" media bias is, and was, laughable. \n \n William Kristol (AKA \"Dan Qualyes brain), devout conservative and long time supporter of the liberal media bias myth said:\n \n \n\"I admit it -- the liberal media were never that powerful, and the whole thing was often used as an excuse by conservatives for conservative failures.\"\n\n \n I think he hits the nail right on the head there. I have never seen a complaint of \"liberal bias\" that was actualyl backed by any kind of evidence or even a logical argument where examples of such bias are shown. Usually what they boil down to is that they don't feel that the \"liberal media\" shows what THEY want to see. Usually, in my experience, that is because what they want to see is stupid #### that nobody else is interested in. I don't knwo how many times I saw saw people complain that the media was not showing all the good we were doing in IRaq. I'm sorry, but rebuilindg schools and hospitals (that we blew up to begin with) is BORING. Leveling a city of 500,000 is COOL and INTERESTING. Even Faux news eventually caught on to this. They relaized (finally, after loosing a lot of market share) that even THEIR viewers were not stupid enough to believe that the war was just an unending stream of happy reconstruction stories.",

At one time they picked up a 25% market share. Now that is down by about 10% and their profit projections are not looking too hot. They went to far to the extreme. I think that fox viewers got tired of polls showing they were uninfromed on most issues.\n \n I did find this interesting from your link:\n \n \nYet, despite the number of claims of bias in the media, a survey conducted by the Pew Center found that 67% of Americans report they prefer to receive unbiased news, while only 25% of Americans report being in favor of news reflecting their political leanings\n\n \n On its own, boring. Couple it with this, though, and it is at least food for thought:\n \n \nBy comparison, the Fox News Channel's credibility rating moved up from 26% in 2000 to 29% in 2004, and the percentage of people who watch Fox News rose from 17% in 1998 to 25% in 2004, giving the Fox News Channel a larger audience than CNN. The Fox News Channel has become Republicans' most credible source for the news among television and cable news outlets, and CNN is now Republicans' second most trusted source. \n\n \n Hmmm, so, 25% of people prefer a news source that is biased, and 25% watch fox news. Coincidence??? It would be interested to see a follow up on this and see if the percentage of people who prefer a biased news source has shrunk with Foxs viewing audience. \n \n I am a little confused about how the article came to its conclusion that they presented any proof at all of media bias. All they showed is that there exists a perception of media bias.\n \n I used to watch fox news all the time. They slowly moved from a news source with a slightly conservative tilt to a sickening orgy of neoconservative cheerleading. That is when I stopped watching them. They just don't have any credibility left. I think that when they first started, it was a good idea. Their business and economic shows were second to none. Now even those have gone in the toilet. They have abandoned the \"news with a conservative leaning\" that they started with and gone to \"no news, but lots of pseudo conservative cheerleading\". \n \n I will pass on that, thanks.
