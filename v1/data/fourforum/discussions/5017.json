   "Political correctness - which I would define as a form of censorship - is utilised by people with a dogmatic mindset (and an ideological agenda) in order to control and to limit freedom of expression.\n \n Most of us are familiar with the concept and how it is used to enforce conformity of opinions in the workplace, in the media, and especially in academic institutions. But where did it originate ? Is it just a silly fad, a trivial nuisance, or a humour of the times that will pass away as other things do ?\n \n Well, it's been around for longer than we tend to suppose. Its theoretical roots can be located in revolutionary communism, and the \"original thinkers\" who first applied political correctness to the shaping of their (totalitarian) societies were, Lenin and Mao Tse Tung.\n \n Political correctness is no laughing matter. It's a dangerous threat to freedom, and its practitioners know that language is an essential tool of power and use it to intimidate non-conformists and to make them get in line.",

   "Suppression of criticism of certain ideas, points of view, etc. is what happens when politcally correct thinking is imposed. That is a point you've failed to grasp over and over again.\n\n \n I understand that this may be the result from politicly correct thinking is applied. The same thing may happen when common sence is applied as well. I just don`t agree that it is a problem and I think that everyone has the right to be politicly correct and voice their politicly correct oppinions...\n \n \nWho decides what is \"unacceptable\" ? You ?\n\n \n It depends on the circumstance, but I certainly decide what I find acceptable or not...\n \n \nYou have misunderstood so many points which have had to be repeated to the point of tedium.\n\n \n Okey.",

He did not actually DO anything, he merely made some suggestions that offended politically correct feminist opinion.\n \n You appear to think the reaction of \"outrage\" to his suggestions was, to use your word, \"acceptable\" and what he said was \"unacceptable\" - not just to you personally, but in a wider social sense.\n \n My position on this matter is cautiously libertarian: that is to say, in general, I believe that there should be a presumption in favour of permitting human behaviours rather than prohibiting them. This is not so much a doctrine as an attitude (towards the state, human conduct, etc.).\n \n It's been fun discussing the topic with you: however, I now suspect that your interest in this thread is dedicated to (you) having the last say. Please be my guest in that respect - because I shall not be responding to any more of your contributions merely to cover the same ground which has been tramped over several times already.",
