They have so effectively dumbed down America to the point that the majority of Americans are now dumber than rocks.\n \n Case in point: \"Healthcare is a right\" Exactly where is that in the Constitution?\n\n \n Nancy Pelosi even admitted she could not do math! \"The gas prices are 3 times more now than when Bush was in office. It was 1 dollar something then. Now it is 3 times that which is about $2.56.\" Right Pelosi, because a dollar something times three =$2.56. If she cannot do that, then do you want her running our healthcare? What is more is that the people that are actually going to run this thing are more IRS agents. Are you kidding me? You do not have to be a financial expert to know that the IRS harrasses us constantly! Just recently, a car wash was visited by several IRS members in order to get 4 cents in taxes the owner did not pay, and you want them in charge of your healthcare?! Taxes for the individual and families are going go through the roof. This also includes small biz owners whose taxes will go to paying for alot of this bill. Not only taxes, but it will cut 500 billion dollars from the already cash strapped Medicare program. Can Obama even name a fiscally sound government run program? If that was not bad enough, premiums on private health insurance will skyrocket to help pay for this bill. That means that the support healthcare reform commercials are wrong when they say you will get to keep your health insurance. That is true, if you are Bill Gates! Since no one can pay these premiums, the healthcare companies will go out of biz. The bill makes it illegal for people not to have health insurance or pay a fine. If you refuse to do any of those two, you get thrown in jail. Nobody cares if you have to buy car insurance because at least you only have to pay if you drive. For example, if a guy owns a car but never drives it because he can walk to where he works, he does not need auto insurance. However, forcing people to buy health insurance? It would not matter as much if people said, oh I will take my chances and not buy any, but no, you will end up in jail! That is like saying you need to pay to live!\n If this bill passes, I am moving to Canada. Better there system as much as I disagree with it then this monstrosity of a bill. Anyone who knows the facts of this bill and still supports it must either be insane or a federal employee. The bill says, that even though the dems claim it is so awesome, all federal employees including Congress and the President will be exempt from it and have a 5 star healthcare plan. This all amounts up to over 1-2 TRILLION dollars over 10 years. If this passes, God help us all. By the way steamroller, not all rights are listed in the constitution. Ammendment either 9 or 10 says there are other rights, but the catch is they come from God. So even though that ammendment exists, God never said healthcare is a right, nor food, nor shelther, nor clothing. Is this really the bill we want to burden our children with? A debt of who knows how high?",
