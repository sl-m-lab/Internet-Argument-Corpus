   "I've watched, participated in and heard this type of debate subject for more years than I can remember. Regardless of what form tax reform speculation takes, it always comes down to what would make it happen. \n \n I'm sure most posters are aware that as a nation we're currently in a somewhat precarious financial position, deficit spending now accounting for a major portion of the annual federal budget and foreign entities purchasing those treasury issues required to keep our leaky boat afloat. Investments such as bonds are floated on a combination of credit worthiness, ability to service the debt and market demand. That requires constant monitoring of our economy, the dollar and political circumstances (what we're doing) by any prudent investor. They all know us well and any change would have to offer them a premium to go through that change. Commerce doesn't like change without benefit. That just cuts earnings. Our IRS, a mature bureaucratic monster, would be a nightmare for at least three years.\n \n My opinion is that revenue would require an increase in taxation, at least 20% to pay for the administrative changeover the first year, to make it fly. Then an upward progression to meet established goals that would satisfy the investors. You're talking about changing the largest non-military system we have, still not completely networked. Any idea of how massive that is? \n \n A national, all-encompassing, internet being the easy one, single tax collection will require some changes, and this country is still clinging to many traditional values like constitutional rights. Any decent system will be able to trace every sale from manufacturer/seller to consumer. Human nature being what it is, that will create a substantial black market. And a new class of criminal to service it. Random, official checks to dertermine if the tax was paid? Some big adjustments. \n \n What crisis will it take to make it happen?",

   "why, the corp's can still pay the workers $1 a day in other countries.\n\n \n I think it is suggested that a simpler tax code and paying less in taxes will be helpful in attracting companies here. Sure you still have the $1 a day labor camps in other countries but helping the business environment here sure won't hurt.\n \n \nOnce again, why? The government will still need the same amount of money (or as history shows more)\n\n \n Or maybe a bit less if we don't have to fund our IRS any longer. And maybe companies will spend less wasted money on their tax accounting and be able to improve their products or lower their prices instead.\n \n This raises another question. Think of the number of jobs that would be lost in the accounting and legal fields alone to this. Wonder if it would be at all significant?",

   "I have a couple of questio9ns for ValiantForTruth's statements\n \n Are you saying that the government would send a check to the poor families on the first of the month, for exactly the amount of tax they will pay in that month? And how would the government know the right amount?\n\n \n Yes, the government would provide EVERY \"American\" family (rich and poor) with a rebate of the sales tax equal to spending up to the federal poverty level. This rebate would be paid in advance and updated according to the Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines. \n \n For example, based on the 2003 guidelines, a family of four would be able to spend $24,240 annually tax free. Therefore, every family of four would receive a rebate check of $465 each and every month ($5,575 annually). \n \n $24,240 times 23% = $5,575\n $5,575 divided by 12 months = $465\n \n The rebate is simply an annual amount divided into 12 equal payments. The amount depends on the size of your family, and the poverty level. \n \n \n \nEconomic growth will increase dramtically. \n \n Once again, why? The government will still need the same amount of money (or as history shows more)\n\n \n With the penalty (INCOME TAXES) for working harder and producing more, removed, Americans are free to keep every dollar they earn, and a new era of economic growth and job creation is unleashed. How? Hidden taxes will be history, Employees will bring home 100% of their paycheck, Americans will be able to save more, and businesses will be able to invest more. Thus, Capital formation (the real source of job creation and innovation) will be facilitated. Gross domestic product (GDP) will increase by an estimated 10.5 percent in the first year alone. \n \n The FairTax as proposed will raise the economy's capital stock by 42 percent, its labor supply by four percent, its output by 12 percent, and its real wage rate by eight percent. \n \n repatriate  - (def.) To bring home assets that are currently held in a foreign country. Domestic corporations are frequently taxed on the profits that they repatriate, a factor inducing the firms to leave overseas the profits earned there.\n \n U.S. companies with investments or plants abroad will bring home overseas profits without the penalty of paying income taxes, thus resulting in more U.S. capital investment. \n \n As U.S. companies and individuals repatriate (on a tax-free basis) income generated overseas, huge amounts of new capital flood into the United States. With such a huge capital supply, real interest rates will remain low. Additionally, other international investors will seek to invest here to avoid taxes on income in their own countries, thereby further spurring the growth of our own economy.\n \n Since all U.S. exporters will immediately see an average 20-percent reduction in their production costs (because of the missing hidden taxes), they will experience an immediate boost in their competitiveness overseas. American companies doing business internationally will be able to sell their goods at lower prices but similar margins, and this will bring jobs to America.\n \n Also, imports and domestic production will be on a level playing field. Exported goods will not be subject to the FairTax, since they are not consumed in the U.S. But imported goods sold in the U.S. will be subject to the FairTax, at the retail point of sale, because these products will be consumed domestically.\n \n The Fair Tax is simple, and will resolve many economic problems. This is because taxing INCOME is like trying to run a Marathon into a 50mph headwind... it holds you back. Getting rid of the INCOME tax will be like turning that headwind into a tailwind. It will be a \"boost\" to every American.\n \n Don\n www.fairtax.org",

   "Here's the way to generate (inside the U. S. economy) \"heaps & gobs\" of money that will be looking for a place to be spent or invested.\n \n America is currently plagued by the problem of joblessness, and in spite of the best efforts of those in charge of remedying it, little, if any, progress is being made. Other countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and others seem not to have this problem to the great extent that the U. S. A. does. America's retail shelves are stacked with cheaper foreign goods that have driven American manufactured goods out of the market. Americans no longer provide many services in the U. S. A. because they have been outsourced to foreign countries such as India because labor costs are much cheaper there.\n \n Methods of taxation in other countries also contribute to the American unemployment problem. Most Americans do not realize the Europeans, Australians, and Canadians (with their GST----Goods and Sales tax), and countless others with a VAT (Value Added Tax) have had a discriminatory tax on American goods and services for decades! This discriminatory tax is 15 to 25% in Europe. \n \n It works like this: every business has many costs, one of which is taxes (payroll taxes, profits taxes, etc.). In the U. S. A., these costs, like all other costs, are included in the prices of our products, but we don't itemize (clearly showing) the specific increment that is taxes. When we ship that product to Europe, etc., they add the VAT to the already tax-laden American product.\n \n Companies in the VAT countries, like American companies, have to pay taxes, but they keep track of the taxes as the product proceeds along the production process. They call the incremental taxes VAT. When the product is put on the retail shelf in Europe, etc., it includes the VAT, and the VAT is revealed to the customer. \n \n Now it gets interesting: when a tax-laden American product (about 22% on average) is put on the shelf next to the EU product, in Europe, the VAT is added to the American product. Now the American product is 20+% more expensive than the comparable EU product! Guess which one sells? \n \n Conversely, when the EU product is exported, they remove the VAT! When that EU product is exported to the US, it sits on the retail shelf in the US with no taxes included right next to the American product with all the taxes included! So, once again, the American product is 20+% more expensive than the comparable EU product, and on our own shores! Guess which one sells?\n \n We have put up with this nonsense for decades, while we debate tariffs on foreign steel and other like products produced domestically in the U. S. A. that must be protected from foreign competition if our domestic industry is to survive. Tariffs and other protectionism measures have not proven to be a satisfactory solution in protecting our domestic job market. The Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 was enacted to protect the American farmer from competition from much cheaper imported farm products. It represents the high-water mark of U.S. protectionism in the twentieth century, and it precipitated negative results (retaliation by other countries).\n \n There is a plan all ready to go that, if enacted into law now, will produce the kind of super-rapid economic growth and new job-creation that is sorely needed, plus generate many additional good results for our nation! It is H.R. 25, the Fair Tax Act of 2003. This bill has bi-partisan sponsorship, widespread support among the hard-working taxpayers/voters, and fast growing support within the House of Representatives (over 55 co-sponsors) and Senate.\n The Fair Tax will produce these highly desirable results:\n \u00b7 Our nation will enter a period of many years of sustained economic growth with new job-creation unequalled by anything in our past history.\n \u00b7 The Fair Tax plan will bring back a measure of fairness and freedom to America that has been sorely trampled-upon by the Income Tax System (and IRS) for many, many years.\n \u00b7 Receipts from the Fair Tax will be more than sufficient to fund the Social Security System and Medicare, plus enable the government to meet its needs and steadily pay-down the national debt.\n \n The Fair Tax draws on a much larger tax base (our GNP, gross national product each year, when it is sold) than does the income tax; virtually no one will be able to evade paying at the \"check-out\" register. This will lighten the load for all of us. Under the Fair Tax the \"sticker price\" of all that you buy will fall 20-30%. So, even with the 23% Fair Tax added on, the cost of living would be no more than it is now, more likely it would be less.\n \n The Fair Tax will:\n \n \u00b7 Replace the current complex and unfair federal tax system with a simple sales tax.\n \n \u00b7 Eliminate personal and corporate income taxes and Social Security, Medicare, gift and estate taxes. \n \n \u00b7 Save taxpayers $250-$600 billion now being wasted in complying with the current tax code.\n \n \u00b7 Lower \"sticker\" prices 20-30% by removing the cost of business compliance with the current tax code.\n \n \u00b7 Make American products more competitive with foreign products. Thus, hurling American manufacturing levels to dizzying heights not seen within recent memory.\n \n \u00b7 Provide a more stable revenue source and raise the same amount of money for the federal government with the imposition of a 23% sales tax with no loopholes.\n \n \u00b7 Dramatically lower tax rates for lower and middle-income Americans by pre-bate payments to households to offset the sales tax on necessities.\n \n \u00b7 Protect and ensure the funding of Social Security and Medicare. \n \n \u00b7 Repeal the 16th Amendment and eliminate the Internal Revenue Service as we know it. Taxes on income will no longer be constitutional.\n \n \u00b7 Bring capital investment flooding onto American shores. Business, no longer being taxed, will enjoy America as the most \"business-friendly\" nation on earth.\n \n Whole-heartedly support House Resolution #25---the Fair Tax reform proposal as a curative solution to relieve the American people of the tyranny of our present tax system (income tax IRS) and put Americans back to work. That would be a great legacy to leave the American people.\n \n The current 7-million-word tax code requires 1,168 pages (2 volumes) to publish, and an additional 6,439 pages of Federal Tax regulations that apply to income taxes. The IRS has created 480 tax forms with an additional 280 to explain how to fill out the 480. More Americans work in tax compliance occupations (CPAs, tax attorneys, etc.) than serve in the entire U.S. Armed Forces. The IRS is twice as big as the CIA and five times the size of the FBI. The compliance costs dwarf the amount of the tax collected. In addition to that, the IRS spends a yearly $10 billion budget. The total national cost of compliance (not counting the taxes paid) is $250 billion yearly. That's $850 per capita of U.S. population.\n \n The Fair Tax reform proposal, which may be fully understood at the website www.fairtax.org, is the best alternative to replace the IRS. It is a simple (retail only) national sales tax. It is not a VAT (value added tax---applied at every level of the production process). Business-to-business transactions, not being retail, are not taxed. Nothing is deducted from the employee's paycheck. He has to spend it on new goods only, not used goods, for it to be taxed. Thus, one is in charge of one's own \"tax destiny.\"\n \n The individual person is allowed to spend the first $8,860 of his yearly income tax-free (he will get monthly reimbursement refund checks for taxes paid on that amount), $17,720 (for a couple), $20,800 (household of 3), $23,880 (h.h. of 4), $26,960 (h.h. of 5), $30,040 (h.h. of 6), $33,120 (h.h. of 7), $36, 200 (h.h. of 8).\n \n Under this system, \"sticker\" prices would fall 20-30%, thus, giving our exports a much better competitive edge when sold abroad. This would \"kick\" the economy into high gear. Businesses (no longer having to send the IRS any money at all) would simply pass the savings on to the consumer, their shareholders, and their employees as higher wages. Forty-five of the fifty states use a sales tax to generate revenue because they know that it is the fairest, simplest, easiest, most cost-effective, most problem-free method of taxation. The state taxing authority in each state would assume the duty of collecting the national sales tax for the U. S. government. Only the retailers file a tax return stating the amount of their sales for the year. For everyone else, April 15 is just another spring day.\n \n Each taxpayer gets a monthly refund check in the amount taxed on his spending up to the poverty line. So, in effect, he is only taxed on his spending above the poverty line. In no case will anyone sacrifice more than 23% of his total income to the sales tax, even if he spends all his income on retail purchases.\n \n Unspent income remains tax-free and available for investment or education expenses. Compliance cost of administering the Fair Tax is only $8 billion yearly. That is a big savings compared to the $250 billion we now pay. The IRS, with all the taxpayer support services that it has made necessary, is intolerably burdensome and expensive.\n \n At the Fair Tax website, don't stop with the first frame. Click on each of the major headings for more complete information. It will take awhile to do all this, but it is well worth it. You will learn everything you've always wanted to know about the economy and taxation, but were afraid to ask! \n \n See also: \n http://www.fairtaxvolunteer.org/materials/comparison.html\n and http://www.geocities.com/cmcofer/fca3.html.\n Then go to www.congress.org and tell your congressmen that you\n want the Fair Tax Act, HR 25, passed into law ASAP!\n America, producing an endless supply of high quality, competitively priced goods and services, will have a behemoth-size trade surplus. An ever-expanding economy will shift the balance of payments in favor of the U. S. A. America will be a lender to many, a debtor to none. There will be jobs and income for all who will work.\n \n \"There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come.\" ---Victor Hugo.\n \n Sincerely Yours,\n \n John Paul McDaniel",

Where is all that $12-Billion going? In 1993, the IRS (whose business is accounting) could not account for 64% of its own budget, according to an audit by the U.S. General Accounting Office. 64% of $12-Billion is $7.68-Billion. The estimated cost to update the IRS's computers for the year 2000 was only (10% of the unaccounted money) $800-Million. The IRS then spent $8-Billion (10 times the estimate) to upgrade its computer system UN-successfully. Now they want $23-Billion MORE for computerization and modernization plans by 2008. \n \n Scrapping the tax code and replacing it with a national retail sales tax would eliminate the need for audit manpower, and would allow the government to institute a \"simpler\" computer system, without increasing the budget.\n \n \n \nDue to deferred taxes and other complications within our current code, that entity would remain in place as a parallel system for a minimum of 5-years during any major tax reform. \n\n \n If so, the IRS would be downsized considerably as it will have less to do, since the number of tax filers would drop from 117.5 million to an estimated 14 million, a 79% reduction. \n \n \n \nThen we get to the cost of the new collection agency.

   "I'm still on collections. 941 taxes, the largest single piece of tax revenue cash flow, are filed electronically (after a low threshold), with funds immediately available to the government within 24-hours of the incurred taxes. \n \n State tax agencies collect sales tax on an average of 30-days after the reporting month, with the majority of states imposing sales tax accounting for them on a manual basis. A side note to that is a state with 8% sales tax will collect 31% of all new transactions? That'll be some real sticker shock to purchasers.\n \n Correct me if I'm wrong, but I see a cash flow shortfall of 14-40 days from sale to collection over current source collection methods. Given the size of our new purchase transaction economy, public debt to capitalize the ongoing shortfall will be approximately 23% of monthly GDP less used goods? Any idea of how massive that number is? \n \n Now back to non-cash flow change over cost capitalization. Virtually all states use the honor system of reporting, filed manually by retailers, an important cash flow issue to those retailers built into all business plans. Would a new system not require software development to encompass all sellers, not a matter to be taken lightly and a foregone nightmare with costs of say a minimum 5% of annual tax collection volume based on current business entity budgeting for software maintenance and upgrades? And hardware costs to link all those field offices and regional agencies into a central data bank would be?\n \n Periodic sales tax field audits are far, far more complicated than any income tax audit. I'd estimate than even a 1% sampling sales tax audit would greatly exceed all current IRS income tax audit requirements with regard to personel, facilities and logistical support. \n \n Without the methodology, big, big bucks, to track individual components and finished products from source to purchaser and establish tax liability, I won't get into the sieve presented to scofflaws, black market entrepreneurs and the normal percentage of 'honest' people who like to avoid taxes. That's an entirely different loss of tax revenue which would be eagerly exploited. \n \n The real property sales tax concern voiced by emclean needs to be addressed. No creditable lender would put 23% of air into a mortgage. An individual would be looking at a 33% down payment (assuming they could qualify for a 90% loan), and our debt laden, non-saving public generally doesn't have the capability to do that.

He now has more operating capital and reduced labor charges. Hence he can produce the burger stove for less money. \n \n If you have any faith in capitalism then you will have faith in the fact that prices will fall. Let's say the burger stove builder spends $200 to build a stove now. Let's also say he makes 20% on each stove. That means his stove is selling for $240 +tax. Now under the fairtax plan he no longer has to match employee contributions and pay tax on the materials he buys, so he can now build the stove for $160. He was happy to make a 20% mark up before and he knows that everyone else in the burger stove business is also happy making 20%. He knows that in a capitalistic market if he keeps his price at $240 dollars and tries to hord the extra profit plus tack on a 23% sales tax his burger stoves will not sell because everybody else in the burger stove business is going to be charging the same old 20%. That means they are selling their burger stoves for $192 + tax. All the sudden his stove is priced $48 above everyone elses. He had better have a good marketing plan or one damn good stove if he is going to be charging more than the rest of the market or his product won't sell. \n \n That is why I feel confident prices will come down. I make a living in the market I just described everyday. We adjust our prices to fit in the market whenever needed. So will the burger stove builder.\n \n George, a chinese owned and operated burger stove builder will not be affected much. However an American owned burger stove builder that has been building in China may bring his operation back to American shores. His rate of taxation will drop considerably. He will no longer have to match contributions for employees or pay tax on the materials needed for building the burger stoves. Hence lowering the cost of doing business in the country. When you couple that with the expenses of shipping back to the states, forgien government taxes and bribes, and the hassle of doing business overseas as well as the other expenses required with the logistics in a foriegn country, it might be enought to justify bringing the operation back home.Of coarse this is where more jobs in the manufacturing sector would start.\n \n This makes sense to me. Where is the logic flawed?",

That's why I'm pretty darn certain that prices would remain largely the same despite potential decreases in the cost of the item. Competition is great, but fattening up the bottom line is even better. Just look at gas prices or the prices of new vehicles now.\n \n As for foreign goods, I'm not sure how that works out.

Then we would have to retaliate by lowereing our prices. All the while prices are coming down and the consumer gets a better deal.\n\n \n I think I'm grasping it just fine, I'm maybe just not expressing myself clearly. At any rate, I went and read through several pages of the site.\n \n All you need is Tony Robbins waving his arms and you'd have one heck of an infomercial. :p\n \n Quite frankly, I don't buy most of it, I'm very very skeptical of the rest.\n \n I'm fully aware that Ford doesn't owe the gov't money, I don't think I even inferred that in my post, but I guess I did. I stated that Ford, the retail branch of Ford, has to administer a 24% tax on it's goods. For the purposes of the consumer, the price just went up 24%. For the purposes of Ford, they now not only have a \"higher priced\" item to sell, but they have to do the Federal gov'ts dirty work and collect their taxes for them, an additional expense above and beyond their current expenses.\n \n As for Pizza Hut vs. Dominoes, they are still making record profits, correct? So how do they do this if they're giving away pizzas? They cut costs obviously. Sure you have two pizzas, but guess what, if you add them together, they might be about 20% bigger than the original one, and they contain the same amount of toppings between two as the first one. \n \n I agree with that the market will set pricing for the most part due to competition, however, for many industries and retail products you can't just \"shop one dealer against the next\", and even within the industries where the consumer has this option, prices are controlled. Car dealers and I'm sure boat dealers as well work within margins and prices set by the manufacturer. Those that break those margins will generally be chastized by the manufacturer as well as other dealers, not to mention shoot themselves in the foot. Just look at Toyota dealer's pricing plans country wide, they're set by Toyota, blatantly. Ford does the same, they're just a lot sneakier about it. \n \n OK. Beyond that, I just don't see the numbers adding up. Especially when you eliminate corporate taxes but you don't charge any tax on wholesale transactions. Take the oil business. The company I work for has no retail outlets, we produce mostly natural gas, process it, and sell it to distributors and energy suppliers. We currently pay HUGE $$$$ in taxes, under this plan, if I understand it, we would no longer pay taxes in any form, while at the same time, our labour costs would potentially decrease. Since neither of these factors would affect the price of natural gas, the company just got richer and the gov't just got A LOT poorer.\n \n Another point - The number is something like 80% of taxes are paid by 10% of the tax payers (roughly, I know the numbers are in that ball park). What if these people aren't spending their money? What if they they are spending money at the rate the average middle class person is? Double? 10X? What do you need to make up that short coming? \n \n There are all kinds of plans in the Fairtax strategy to elimate collecting the tax on those \"below the poverty line\" and provide rebates for essentials. Where does that money come from? I could make $1,000,000/year, but if I my house is paid for, I live on peanut butter and crackers, and drive an old beater, I could be in for a nice tax refund.\n \n The whole thing is predicated on continued high rates of consumer spending and a forcast of economic growth. I have a very hard time with that, I see more of the opposite happening, especially short term.\n \n Not only that, but I just have a hard time believing that spending by consumers will keep up with spending by gov't, especially at current levels and with the growing debt.\n \n Thoughts?\n \n Waxy",

The difference in retail cost is pennies no matter where you go.\n \n I can see your point, and I too believe that the market controls pricing for the most part, however, I also think it's naieve to believe that manufacturers, and through them retailers, are without the ability to set and maintain prices in many cases, if not most.\n \n Waxy",

   "I'm skeptical to say the least.\n \n While I believe and anything that makes business easier is basically good for the economy and therefore the humans, here are my initial concerns:\n \n 1. From the business's point of view, what does it take to implement VAT. Europe survived it. But the changeover has to be very painful.\n \n 2. From the human's point of view, 2 concerns:\n \n A. Taxing new construction. Yikes. Since value is determined by comparables, existing construction will go up too, almost immediately. As soon as a couple houses sell, the appraiser can justify that new value. (There goes property taxes.) Sounds like a dream scenario for mortgage lenders and brokers and even realtors. They all work on percents. And a way to push consumer debt through the roof. But if this is supposedly a break even for the humans, how do they pay the increased housing cost? That concept of comparables by the way is what will save all industries. Used items won't be cheaper for more than a New York minute.\n \n B. Reimbursement to the poverty level. Let's look at the breakdown of the income brackets first. The impact would fall hardest on those who are just above the poverty level -- the $32,000 family with 2 kids. Then, let's look at the biggest winners.\n \n Truly, I'm all for making businesses more competitive in the world market. This idea still needs a bit of work. Maybe, just maybe, if the businesses got on the new plan first. In other words, how would it be possible to first reduce the cost of that 2 by 4 to avoid the inevitable bump.",

Let me state my question differently.\n \n I used housing as an example because it's such a hugh ticket. But actually my question applies to everything.\n \n Let's take every single saleable item that already sitting on every store shelf. Assume that that item is marked at $1 as of the moment of change over. That dollar price tag already includes the \"hidden taxes\". I walk to the cash register and get charged $1.31. That item got taxed double.\n \n Now I have to trust that the free market will right itself. The price will come down. But I have to trust that that item will go down to 69 cents.

This is a HUGE decision to make, good or bad, and the problems of transitioning to a new system are compounded by the fact that it must be done by government, which is inherently inefficient. I agree that our current tax codes, about sixty large volumes that no one understands, is a colossal mess begging to be fixed. My problem is: Can we make the transplant without killing the patient?

   "In a market where there is no barrier to entry, when a firm or a \n group of firms make a [economic] profit that goes beyond the normal \n operating cost (normal profit which includes salaries, dividends, \n etc.), it creates incentive for other firms to enter the market. \n \n All things being equal, the demand for the product being constant, \n larger the number of new firms entering the market, lower the prices \n that can be charged by the new firms (assuming no product \n differentiation). If the newer firms are offering less for the same \n product, older firms already in the market need to lower their \n prices accordingly or it will lose market share.\n \n\n \n You are trying to describe a perfectly competative market which requires:\n \n 1: Free exit from and entering to the market\n 2: The consumers must have full information regarding the products and the alternatives, the firms must have full information regarding the consumers and their preferences.\n 3: The product must be homogenous (no differentiation)\n 4: The market and its actors must have high flexability to either change their producer of choice (consumers) or to change the price (the producers)\n 5: No cooperation between producers and or between consumers and producers may exist on the market.\n 6: The market must be large enough to contain a multitude of producers and consumers\n 7: There may not be any economics of scale involved with the production.\n \n I`m not sure there is any market for any type of product in the world that fulfill all of these criterias... However, the theory of a perfectly competative market is highly informative and useful nonetheless. The trends are still true (that is, competition drives prices towards equilibrium. The closer the market is tothe perfect market, the closer to equilibrium price)\n \n \nOne more thing ---- price gouging is actually a positive thing since it creates stimulus for other firms to enter the market to take advantage of the large profit (price gouging). But larger the \n number of new firms entering the market, lower the long term prices, \n and larger the supply.\n \n People who doesn't understand economics think that price gouging in \n vaccines or oil was wrong, when in fact, that was the best thing to \n happen because if it was allowed to continue, supply would have \n increased.\n\n \n No. You are making a false assumption here. An increase in price do not create a shift in supply. The price gouging itself is an act of increasing the price wich will result in a decrease of the quantity sold. When there is new entry into the market, these new entrants will drive down the price to previous levels which will result in driving up the quantity sold to previous levels. The long term effects is not increased supply or lower prices. Only maintained levels. However, the short term effects of the price gouge is higher prices and lower quantities sold. The supply curve is not affected at all. The end result is negative.... \n \n \n\n Here's a simple intuitive example. Suppose there was a disaster \n which destroyed all the electrical circuits in your area, and \n there's only one electrician in town. There would be large demand \n for his services, which would drive his hourly wages up. If the \n incident was isolated to this particular area and electricians in \n other town realized that they could make several times more offering \n services at one-electrician-only town, they would start offering \n services there (from nearby town), driving up the supply of \n available electricians. In the long term, prices would drop and \n equalize at normal equilibrium.\n\n \n Your intuitive example is dead wrong. Nothing about the event shifts the supply. Increased demand only intersect the same curve of supply at a different price level. The short term effect is higher prices to meet the higher demand and more electrician hours are consumed. The new entrants on the market will shift the supply curve to meet the higher demand but when the demand shifts back after the disaster, the price must drop dramaticly to meet the lower demand. This will in turn cause the opportunity cost of in the local market to increase and the new entrants will exit the market which will drive down the supply. Micro-economic end result; alot of broken circuits and wasted resources to fix them.\n \n Now at first glance, this may sound confusing as both scenarios involved new entrants and only one of them experienced a shift in supply (that later reverted). The reason for this is that it reasonable to assume that in the first example, the market was allready at equilibrium before the price gauge. The effects of the price gouge is to be likened with a decrease in supply. The only role the new entrants on that market fulfilled was to revert the supply back to its old levels. While it is not certain that this happened, the reason for the inclarities is the fact that we don`t actually know what caused the price gouge in the first place. If the opportunity to gouge the prices occured due to failing competitors, the supply shift was real. If the opporutnity to gouge the prices was due to one firm suddenly discovering their monopoly power the supply did not shift per say, but was rather artificially upheld before the price gauge. In the case of the broken circuits, the supply was in fact created by the new entrants, but as I showed, it reverted back to the original situation (assuming the market experienced perfect competition before the disaster)",

Used items are not taxed.\n \n And perhaps most important of all, the government does not need to know who bought what. \"YOU\" (Joe Consumer) do not need to keep ANY receipts. Only the retailer will be required to keep receipts to show how much Fair Tax he has collected, just like he already does now with local sales taxes. AND...

The TWO 941 accounts would be closed.

Since the Fed Gov has a fiscal year that is different from consumers, and pays its bill after 90 days, the 14 to 40 day shortfall you are concerned about will not be a factor. \n \n The honor system would not be any worse under the Fair Tax than it is under the current system. Actually it will be more trustworthy as it will be more difficult to get away with illegal activities, and less profitable.\n \n Tax evasion under the current Income Tax system is a major problem that is only getting worse. Under the current system, People are encouraged to \"hide\" their income by (hopefully) legal means, or (if you can get away with it) illegal means - ie. by its very nature, the current system PROMOTES evasion. \n \n Based on IRS figures, tax evasion has increased by 67 percent during the past 11 years. As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), tax evasion has reached 2.0 percent compared to 1.6 percent in 1981. Taxes evaded continue to be in the range of 22 to 23 percent of income taxes collected. These IRS figures do not include taxes lost on illegal sources of income. The tax gap now is about $200 billion. \n \n Tax evasion will decline under the FairTax because the chance of evaders being caught will increase and the incentive to cheat will decline. \n \n The FairTax will reduce the number of tax filers by roughly 90 percent. Thus, if enforcement resources remain comparable, audit rates will rise and the chance of evasion being detected will increase. \n \n Also, since marginal tax rates are much lower under the FairTax than under present law, especially for small businesses and sole proprietorships where disproportionate evasion occurs today, the benefit to cheating will be lower. Today, if a self-employed taxpayer fails to report $1,000 they will benefit by $433 ($280 because of the income tax and $153 due to the self-employment tax). Under the FairTax, they would benefit by $230. Since income is no longer taxed, there is nolonger a reason to try and hide it any more. Yes, you are free to make as much as you want without fear of the taxman.\n \n In short, the gains from evasion would decrease, and the potential costs of evasion from detection and enforcement would increase. Thus, the amount of tax evasion can be expected to decline markedly. \n \n \n \nWithout product consumer ID for both business and individual purchases to match inventory depletion, you have big, gaping holes called cash transactions.\n \n \n I do not remember EVER having to give a consumer ID to pay cash for anything. But I do remember almost always getting a receipt. I do recall however, being asked for my zip code a few times - does that count? Look, cash transactions DO still occur now, and they WILL continue to occur under the Fair Tax, and there will still be those who go the route of evasion. However, it is not up to the consumer to prove what he bought and how much tax he paid, it is up to the retailer to prove what he sold and how much tax he owes. If inventory depletion matches the receipts for sales, yippee. If not, ouch!\n \n \n \nWith them {..all those IDs..}, and the eventual elimination of cash, you have police state tracking right down to what each family eats for a meal and when. \n\n \n You (Joe Consumer) are NOT going to be required to verify that you were at the grocery store Tuesday at 6:30 and paid cash for 6 half-gallons of milk just because the grocery store is being audited - honest!!\n \n Administering the FairTax will not be difficult. Retailers will simply collect the tax (like they do now in 45 states) and send it to the state taxing authority, and they will then send the NRST on to the U.S. Treasury. And employers will report your income for Social Security purposes. ....Everything is already in place.\n \n ValiantForTruth\n www.fairtax.org",

Only the money you would spend after the first $18,620 would be taxed. You would be refunded $4,283 (in 12 payments of $357 per month) for the taxes you would pay on $18,620 spent. This is the FCA (Family Consumption allowance) that you would receive based on a family size of 2, using 2004 figures, which is part of the FairTax plan.\n \n If you only spend $18,620, then your effective tax rate is ZERO percent!! If you spend more, say a total of $25,000, your effective tax rate would be only 5.9% because you would not receive a refund on the dollars you spent above $18,620. \n \n \nIf you think it's hard for retirees to live now, without the sales tax, how will we be able to make it, with the tax? Those that are still working will be bringing in tax free income, so for them it won't be a problem.\n\n \n Current prices of products and services include \"hidden taxes\" (corporate taxes, compliance costs, capital gains taxes, payroll taxes). This accounts for about 20-25% of the price we pay for things NOW. The FairTax will eliminate these hidden taxes which will lower prices, so that your dollars go farther. \n \n If you decide to sell property(s), you will not be taxed on the capital gains - you KEEP all your profits. Also, if you decide to GIVE your inheritance to your offspring, they will not be taxed. The FAIR TAX is GOOD for seniors!\n \n ValiantForTruth\n www.fairtax.org",

   "Okay, I am a huge supporter of the Fair Tax in theory, but I haven't read all of the actual proposed legislation so I don't know if I support this particular bill, and I am certainly not in a position to argue anything with any authority, but I have questions:\n \n Many states make food & medical expenses tax exempt. Why couldn't the fed gov't do the same and eliminate rebate checks? Maybe even basic clothing items up to $100 per item? How about making education expenses tax-exempt, as well? \n \n Why would rent be taxed? You're not \"buying\" anything, so it doesn't make sense for you to pay taxes on the same exact thing over and over again. A haircut is a new haircut every time, but rent on a place to live is a duplicating expense. \n \n And, if I understand the previous posts correctly, why not tax on existing home purchases? It's still a new purchase. Wouldn't that decimate new housing starts? Middle class families would avoid building new homes to save 23% on their mortgage.\n \n I obviously need to go read the bill for myself. I already know that I disagree with a couple of things in it (the rebates, for one.)\n \n I also think that the percentage of the population wealthy enough and savvy enough to go to an extensive black market way of doing things is pretty small, although I might be naive on that. If you are taking away the high income, capital gains, estate, etc taxes the wealthy pay currently, they may be thankful enough for taxes on their consumption instead of their earnings to pay the higher cost of goods. After all, they can afford it, esp if their food, medical expenses, and basic clothing remain tax free. If the cost of goods was that big an issue for them, they wouldn't have all of the luxury items they currently have anyway, right?\n \n And since when is encouraging people to save money a bad thing? emoticon_confused We might have people actually planning for their future because they are saving money, thereby reducing the burden on the welfare system. So what if people start thinking about what they are spending and buying used? Money is still moving around within the economy. I sell a used living room set at a yard sale. Someone buys it tax free from me. Now I use that money towards the purchase of my new living room set, or my family vacation, or whatever, and the person who bought it tax free from me uses the money they saved to buy other goods and services.\n \n In an ideal world, those who are truly needy and doing their best to economize may not have to ever pay taxes, which is okay with me. It's enough for me to know that the illegal aliens, drug dealers, etc are now going to be taxed on what they spend.\n \n Looking forward to responses...",

I reckon I could fairly easily find 100 who think it is.\n\n \n www.globalwarminghoax.com check it out for yourself, I don't have time right now.\n \n The truth is, any climatologist I produce will be pooh poohed because he/she has too many vowels in their name, or because he/she wears mismatching socks or whatever reason you can think of. And in the end neither of us will be convinced of the others point of view.\n \n My problem begins when the earth worshippers have the ability to reach into my pocket to fund, and punish those outside of their faith for their cause.\n \n Global Warming is just another tool of the Religious Left to take more control of our lives.\n \n There is enough evidence out there for most people to at least want a fair debate on the subject. But that debate will not take place, because that would shed some doubt concerning your truth about global warming.\n \n If you want to give your money to reduce CO2 emissions.., go ahead.\n If you want to walk to work to reduce CO2 emisions..., go ahead.\n If you want to hold your breath to reduce CO2 emisions.., go ahead. \n \n But I think it is wrong for you to impose those contributions to your religion on me.\n \n BTW what ever happened to the ozone?? Billions of dollars were forced on individuals to reduce refrigerants and then it was later admitted that we no more affect the hole in the ozone than the man on the moon. :xbanghead\n \n Stay out of my pocket.",

The explosion precipitated a massive avalanche that rapidly released volcanic gases, including H2O, SO2, and CO2, into the atmosphere. The blast obliterated 150,000 acres of forest and killing every wild animal that wasn't underground. Hurricane force winds approached the speed of sound, searing the landscape at tempuratures up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. A mushroom cloud rose 15 miles into the atmosphere. Daylight turned dark.

   "\n \n No. But if the greenhouse gases keep the heat from escaping..... how does it let the heat get in? If it is a barrier for escape, how can it not be a barrier from intrusion?\n \n\n \n Because the Sun emits radiation across a broad spectrum. CO2 absorbs radiation efficiently in a more narrow spectrum. The earth absorbs a broad spectrum of the Sun's radiation and emits it in a more narrow spectrum. A more significant proportion of the spectrum is blocked by CO2 for outgoing radiation than incoming. Additionally, the heat retention works by individual photons striking CO2 molecules and raising electrons up an energy level (or several energy levels). When the electron drops down an energy level (a random process), a photon is emitted in a random direction, and will be easily picked up by another CO2 molecule as its energy levels have the same spacing. Add to this the fact that CO2 molecules move around in the atmosphere, and you have a process by which it is easy for energy to enter the atmosphere, and difficult for it to leave. CO2 blocks part of the spectrum, water vapour some more, methane another part, flouro-carbons another.\n \n In case you're wondering, this was what I meant about you not understanding the science. You don't have a basic grasp of quantum mechanics. That's ok, not everyone has studied Theoretical Physics to Masters level, but don't try to dismiss what you clearly don't have a clue about.\n \n As for volcanic eruptions being responsible for the rise in CO2 concentrations, that is patently absurd. A description of a volcanic eruption does not provide any evidence to support your assertion that volcanic activity has increased.\n Not only that, but volcanoes produce ~130 million tonnes a year, with atmospheric levels being around 3 000 000 million tonnes. In 200 years, volcanoes wouldn't be able to raise concentrations by more than about 5 parts per million, whereas since 1832 concentrations in the atmosphere have risen by more than 100 parts per million, due to the contribution to CO2 levels from human activity, around 27 000 million tonnes. Even if volcanic activity has increased 10 fold, it still wouldn't account for the increase.\n Volcanic Gases and Their Effects",

Infected the mind of the scientific community of the planet Earth.\n It took years to affect the majority of its members but due to the intermingling and exchanges of bodily fluids at international scientific gatherings it finally took hold in most of these brilliant brains.\n The clear sign of infection was the publication of learned papers which in lay terms amounted to this:\n \n CO2 is a &#8216;green house&#8217; effect gas. The energy from the sun reflected from the earth into the atmosphere at a lower frequency than the incident energy (light) is trapped by the CO2 in the atmosphere causing the surface temp of the planet to raise. The higher the concentration of CO2 the stronger the effect.\n The CO2 levels at the present has increased dramatically in relation to levels before the Industrial Revolution when burning fossil fuels began, and continues at increasing rates.\n Climate modelling based on data gathered from the past shows that the effects of temperature rises will have catastrophic effects on the climate and not only that but the warming of the earth is causing already ice on the surface of the planet such as the Antarctic to melt and flow into the sea causing a continuous rise of the sea level.\n \n Also the CO2 absorbed by the sea is causing it to become acid and thus is killing the life at the bottom of the food chain. You break the bottom link and eventually the whole chain collapses. This is a slow irrevocable process for which there is strong evidence.\n \n The mad scientists also by close contact with world leaders infected them with these outrageous ideas. Only the Bush and Howard governments showed strong immunity to this disease. However the new guard proved fertile ground for the disease.\n \n Intense scrutiny and maniac Googling has shown that all the above assertions are false, feverish fantasies, the result of the viral infection\n No data has ever been gathered. CO2 is not a green house gas, the glaciers are not melting, the sea level is not rising, the Earth temperature has not increased and the sea tastes as salty as ever. \n \n I am only one of the few lay persons who is also immune to the disease. I call to all fellow thinking persons to rise and fight against this collective scientific madness.\n \n It is not too late, it is not too late&#8230;.\n \n I am sure intelligences far greater than ours have hatched this plan of conquest of our planet.\n \n \n \"No one would have believed in the last years of the twentieth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.\"\n \n Ogilvy",

   "\n they used a lot of sophisticated mathematical modelling in those banking institutions and look at the results. Vodoo modelling means nothing if the output is not scientific, for then what is it but mumbo jumbo?\n\n \n What, exactly, do you think is the difference between climate modelling and the sort of modelling banking institutions use? What makes one of them \"scientific\" and the other not.\n \n Neither of them are scientific, it isn't possible for a model to give a scientific output.\n \n The best way to describe how the models operate is that they codify experience. So if we see historic correlations between trends, we predict that these correlations will continue into the future. \n \n So far as I can tell, the climate models are much less sophisticated than those used by business. Business tends to refuse the use of models unless they at least past stringent validations - these validations don't make the outputs \"scientific\", but they do at least help support a business case for their use.\n \n One way of validating a climate model is to e.g., plug in the data from climate in 1900, and CO2 data for the next 50 years, 100 years, and see how accurate its temperature predictions are, but a model can be calibrated, even over-calibrated, so that it matches historical trends. The tougher test is whether it can predict events in the actual future.\n \n Now if these models only claim to be accurate over 30 or 100 year periods, that's a pretty damn tough validation to meet. If they claimed to predict temperature accurately say, 12 months or 24 months in advance, then they could at least be tested against future trends; they'd potentially meet the standards for a decent model that a business would use.\n \n \nThat is the whole point that the climate is changing due to man's activity\n\n \n Well it was changing before there was man's activity, so clearly you'd be an ##### to deny it was changing at all. I just don't attribute nearly as much of the change to man as you do, and I certainly don't believe the claims about how much man is changing it are scientific.\n \n \nHow can reducing CO2 makes things worse? \n\n \n Well, for example, suppose CO2 output staved off an ice age.\n \n Or more likely, suppose reducing CO2 output hurt the economy, and in doing so, reduced the capability of mankind to deal with natural climate change.\n \n \nHow can we justify ourselves to future generations for sitting on our hands and doing nothing?\n\n \n Sometimes, doing nothing is the best thing. There's often an urge to \"do something\", and that something ends up being pointless or counterproductive.\n \n A recent example might be the ban of DDT for environmental reasons, a ban that has since resulted in ~40 million malarial deaths (hey but who cares, they're just africans, us whiteys can laugh it up about \"not putting poisons into the environment\" and feel all high and mighty about \"doing something\").

The equation that describe the trajectory of a pendulum (position and velocity) is a simple example. \n Designs of wings for airplanes are done based on computer modelling and it works. Plane do fly and the wings are efficient.\n If you have cared to read that article in The New Yorker you would have learnt that climate modelling does work.\n How do you know if it works? Because we can make predictions and see later if they come true or not. It is true, and logical and the way it is done, that the model has to be tuned, altered to reflect new data and to iron out mistakes. Also as the saying says: &#8216;garbage in, garbage out&#8217;.

   "A few months ago, James Hansen, the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), in Manhattan, joined a protest outside the Capitol Power Plant, in Washington, D.C. Thirty years ago, Hansen, who is sixty-eight, created one of the world's first climate models, nicknamed Model Zero, which he used to predict most of what has happened in the climate since. Hansen has now concluded, partly on the basis of his latest modeling efforts and partly on the basis of observations made by other scientists, that the threat of global warming is far greater than even he had suspected. Unless immediate action is taken-including the shutdown of all the world's coal plants within the next two decades-the planet will be committed to climate change on a scale society won't be able to cope with. Hansen grew up in Denison, Iowa, and he obtained a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Iowa. From there he went directly to work at GISS, where he studied Venusian clouds. In 1981, he became the director of GISS. He published a paper forecasting increased temperatures in the following decades and his insights were immediately recognized by the scientific community. Mentions Anniek Hansen, Bill McKibben, Michael Oppenheimer, and Spencer Weart. Describes a talk Hansen gave on climate change at the state capitol in Concord, New Hampshire. \n \n What is now happening, Hansen said, is carbon dioxide is being pumped into the air some ten thousand times faster than natural weathering processes can remove it. There's no precise term for the level of carbon dioxide that will assure a climate disaster; the best scientists have come up with is \"dangerous anthropogenic interference,\" or D.A.I. Hansen estimates the dangerous amount of carbon dioxide to be no more than three hundred and fifty parts per million. The bad news is that carbon dioxide levels have already reached three hundred and eighty-five parts per million. Hansen argues that the only way we can constrain the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is to drastically decrease the use of coal.  \n \n But if Hansen's anxieties about D.A.I. and coal are broadly shared, he is still, among climate scientists, an outlier. Describes the cap-and-trade system, which Hansen argues is essentially a sham. Mentions the American Clean Energy and Security Act. In order to stabilize carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, annual emissions around the globe would have to be cut by something on the order of three-quarters. \n \n So far, there's no evidence that anyone is willing to take the necessary steps.\n \n Profiles: The Catastrophist: Reporting & Essays: The New Yorker",

Now certainly there are simplifications in the models, but there is no reason to believe that the simplifications are significant. We're not on the level of \"temperature goes up when CO2 levels go up\", we're at the level of *this* much CO2 will result in roughly *this* much warming.

   "Now certainly there are simplifications in the models, but there is no reason to believe that the simplifications are significant. \n\n \n Well obviously they're significant when different models produce vastly different forecasts.\n \n Unless you mean significant in the technical sense of \"statistically significant\", in which case the only reason differences aren't \"significant\" is because the confidence intervals are so large.\n \n \nstatistical modelling of physical processes is highly effective\n\n \n I beg to differ. It is highly effective for some physical processes, particularly closed systems where all the variables are known, and their relationships are defined by physical laws.\n \n \nWe're not talking about correlation, we're talking about direct causation, by the methods I have already described\n\n \n Well not really, most of the proposed warming is supposed to take place via indirect, complex feedback loops that amplify the original effect. The outcomes of these loops, the relative importance of different factors within them, whether all the factors are known (obviously, they all aren't, there is an assumption we've covered off all the important ones) are highly speculative.\n \n \nwhile there are complications in a chaotic system like earth's atmosphere\n\n \n The \"complications\" and assumptions about them are what are responsible for the forecast.\n \n \nI trust independent scientists far more than I trust oil company reps and conspiracy theorists. Is that in some way unreasonable?\n\n \n Yes. It is a common shortcut to trust the forecasts of \"experts\", but there is little evidence for it. It's something that seems intuitively correct, but is ultimately unscientific.",

   "All of physics is above the level of determinism. There is no such thing as determinism in physics, and hasn't been since at least the early 1900s. That said, statistical modelling of physical processes is highly effective, the whole of thermodynamics relies on statistical methods. We're not talking about correlation, we're talking about direct causation, by the methods I have already described. Now certainly there are simplifications in the models, but there is no reason to believe that the simplifications are significant. We're not on the level of \"temperature goes up when CO2 levels go up\", we're at the level of *this* much CO2 will result in roughly *this* much warming. The thermal effects of gases are fairly well understood, and while there are complications in a chaotic system like earth's atmosphere, different models are producing the same results, and while doubt is not unreasonable, total denial and conspiracy theories are. The best science we have available, seriously developed over 3 decades, taken seriously by leaders on both right and left (some of the earliest speeches on the issue were made by Margaret Thatcher), say this is very likely to happen. I understand some of the science, not all of it, but I trust independent scientists far more than I trust oil company reps and conspiracy theorists. Is that in some way unreasonable?\n\n \n The maths behind the modelling are daunting. I don't think a non-expert could determine whether they are right or not. This is the reason governments ask for expert advice on this matter.\n \n What consequences can we expect - COP15 United Nations Climate Change Conference Copenhagen 2009\n \n It is always interesting how deniers fall back from one position to another as time goes by.\n First they refused to admit of global warming, they even insisted that the planet was cooling; then yes, it was warming, but not much; then yes, it was warming up, but it had happened millions of times in the past and it was not due to human action; then, and I think it is the present position: man has contributed to it but we don&#8217;t know how much and the models are not proven, so we better wait and see.\n \n Fortunately? the G8 members are meeting right now in Copenhagen. I am not optimistic about the outcome of this meeting.\n I think in the end, vested interests, short-sight, and selfishness will win the day and the do-nothing mob will prevail.\n Mother Nature will have the last word, I won&#8217;t be around to hear it.",
