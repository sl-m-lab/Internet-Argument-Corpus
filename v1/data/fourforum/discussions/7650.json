That's just one problem with Daniel's historical account: he lists several rulers in the wrong order.\n \n 3) The New Testament (Gospel of Luke) claims that Quirinius was governor of Syria during the reign of King Herod in Palestine, but Flavius Josephus and the Roman historian Tacitus, as well as some inscriptions, indicate that Quirinius wasn't governor then, and that it wasn't until 10 years after King Herod's reign that he was.\n \n \n b) Modifications to the New Testament manuscripts over time\n There are many: both intentional and accidental.

He received the government of Belshazzar the Chaldean upon the death of that prince (Daniel 5:30,31; 6:1), and was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans. \n \n From Daniel 6:28 we may infer that Darius was king contemporaneously with Cyrus. Outside of the Book of Daniel there is no mention of Darius the Mede by name, though there are good reasons for identifying him with Gubaru, or Ugbaru, the governor of Gutium, who is said in the Nabunaid-Cyrus Chronicle to have been appointed by Cyrus as his governor of Babylon after its capture from the Chaldeans. Some reasons for this identification are as follows: \n \n (a) Gubaru is possibly a translation of Darius. The same radical letters in Arabic mean \"king,\" \"compeller,\" \"restrainer.\" In Hebrew, derivations of the root mean \"lord,\" \"mistress,\" \"queen\"; in Aramaic, \"mighty,\" \"almighty.\" \n \n (b) Gutium was the designation of the country North of Babylon and was in all possibility in the time of Cyrus a part of the province of Media. \n \n (c) But even if Gutium were not a part of Media at that time, it was the custom of Persian kings to appoint Medes as well as Persians to satrapies and to the command of armies. Hence, Darius-Gubaru may have been a Mede, even if Gutium were not a part of Media proper. \n \n (d) Since Daniel never calls Darius the Mede king of Media, or king of Persia, it is immaterial what his title or position may have been before he was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans. Since the realm of the Chaldeans never included either Media or Persia, there is absolutely no evidence in the Book of Daniel that its author ever meant to imply that Darius the Mede ever ruled over either Media or Persia. \n \n (e) That Gubaru is called governor (pihatu), and Darius the Mede, king, is no objection to this identification; for in ancient as well as modern oriental empires the governors of provinces and cities were often called kings. \n \n Moreover, in the Aramaic language, no more appropriate word than \"king\" can be found to designate the ruler of a sub-kingdom, or province of the empire. \n \n http://www.studylight.org/enc/isb/view.cgi?number=T2531\n \n Standard Bible Encyclopedia:\n \n DARIUS - \n da-ri'-us: \n \n The name of three or four kings mentioned in the Old Testament.

It was a name. \n\n \n Herodotus says it means in Greek, Erxeies, coercitor, \"restrainer,\" \"compeller,\" \"commander.\"\n \n But someone will say, how do you explain the fact that Daniel gives the name Darius to a man whom the other documents call Gobryas? Many kings in ancient, as well as modern, times had two or more names; especially a pre-regnal and a regnal name. The Rameses II, king of Egypt, seems to be the same as the Sesostris of the Greeks.3 So Solomon is the same as Jedidiah and Uzziah the same as Azariah. But coming nearer to the time of Cyrus, we find that Cyrus himself according to Strabo was called Agradetes before he became king, and Herodotus says that his first name was not Cyrus.4 Josephus says that Artaxerxes was called Cyrus before he became king.5 Darius Nothus and Artaxerxes III were both called Ochus before they became kings;6 and the last Darius, Codomannus.7 Why may not the name Darius have been assumed first of all by Gobryas the Mede, when he became king of Babylon? When Tiglath-Pileser was proclaimed king of Babylon, and\n \n Thus Tiglath-Pileser IV of Assyria was Pul in Babylon.1 Shalmaneser III, king of Assyria, was Ululai king of Babylon; and Ashurbanipal king of Assyria was possibly Kandalanu king of Babylon.\n \n If we could only be sure as to the meaning of the word Darius, we might understand better why the name was given, or assumed, as a royal or princely appellation. The first part of the name may be the same as the New Persian dar\u00e2, \"king.\" Or the name may be derived from the Old Persian verb dar, \"to hold,\" and may simply mean \"holder of the scepter.\" According to Spiegel,2 Bartholom\u00e6,3 and Tolman,4 it comes from dar, \"to hold,\" and a hypothetical vahu (Sansc., vasu), \"good wealth\"; hence \"possessor of wealth.\" The title in either case would be appropriate to Gobryas as sub-king of Babylon, and also to the royal son of Hystaspis, who was by birth a king, second in rank and race to Cyrus alone.5\n \n For it was customary to transmit names of fathers to their grandsons; e.g., the grandfather of Cyrus was Cyrus, and both the father and the son of Cyrus were named Cambyses.2 So Artaxerxes the Second was the son of Darius the son of Artaxerxes the First and Darius the Second was the great-grandson of Darius Hystaspis.3\n \n Among the Arch\u00e6menid\u00e6 we have the names of five Dariuses, three of whom were kings, two kings named Xerxes, and three named Artaxerxes. \n \n While such examples do not prove that Gobryas was also named Darius, they do afford a presumption in favor of the probability that he was; and in view of the other indications in its favor, they should deter anyone from asserting that Gobryas and Darius the Mede were not the same.\n \n Studies In The Book Of Daniel: A Discussion Of The Historical Questions by Robert Dick Wilson.

The eunuch Bagoas, having murdered Artaxerxes III in 338 BC and his son Arses in 336, raised to the throne a distant relative of the royal house, whose name, according to Justin, was Codomannus, and who had excelled in a war against the Cadusians. The new king, who adopted the name of Darius, took warning by the fate of his predecessors, and saved himself from it by forcing Bagoas to drink the cup himself. http://www.nndb.com/people/938/000096650/\n \n Now it appears quite obvious to anyone who wants to be honest that all these Kings had different names / titles at birth other than Darius. So if you guys want to keep playing the deny game then you go right ahead.\n \n So, you folks have not shown that Daniel was in error, and the evidence to the contrary clearly indicates you need to update your arguments and come up with something better.\n \n That dog won't hunt.\n\n \n \n No, yoru sources have definitately showed that Darius was not the title of a king, and you have refuted your own sources.\n \n If you notice, none of those three 'Darius's was Darius the Mede. \n \n Even wikpedia will use 'conjecture' about Darius the Mede.

   "Orion thus ignores the plentiful evidences that contradict his conclusions.\n\n \n A few additional things for your consideration, EZ...\n \n The arguments for a date (of Daniel) shortly before the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 164 are overwhelming. An author living in the 6th cent. could hardly have written the late Hebrew used in Dan., and its Aramaic is certainly later than the Aramaic of the Elephantine papryi, which date from the end of the 5th. cent. (The author's) historical perspective, often hazy for events in the time of the Babylonian and Persian kings but much clearer for the events during the Seleucid dynasty, indicates the Hellenstic age. Finally, his detailed description of the profanation of the Temple of Jerusalem by Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 167 and the following persecution, contrasted with his merely general references to the death of this king in 164 indicates a composition date probably in 165. - The New Jerome Bible Commentary\n \n The literary setting (of Daniel) is not the setting in which the book was actually written. The fact that ch. 11 obviously refers to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Seleucid ruler from Syria, makes it clear that the book took its final form during Antiochus's persecution of the Jews, which began with the desecration of the temple in 167 BCE. - NRSV Study Bible\n \n All but the most consevative scholars now accept the conclusion that the book of Daniel is not a product of the Babylonian era but reached its present form in the 2nd century BCE.

Anderson, Daniel in the Critics Den, pages 104-105\n \n Was Daniel a Prophet?\n \n The Jewish Rabbis on Daniel\n \n Rabbi Judah, the main compiler of the Talmud said regarding the times referred to in Daniel's (Messianic) prophecy, \"These times were over long ago.\" (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin.) \n \n In the 12th Century AD, Rabbi Moses Ben Maimon (Maimonides), one of the most respected rabbis in history, and a man who rejected the messianic claim of Yeshua, stated: \n \n \"Daniel has elucidated to us the knowledge of the end times. However, since they are secret, the wise [rabbis] have barred the calculation of the days of Messiah's coming so that the untutored populace will not be led astray when they see that the End Times have already come but there is no sign of the Messiah.\"\n \n Rabbi Moses Abraham Levi said, \"I have examined and searched all the Holy Scriptures and have not found the time for the coming of Messiah clearly fixed, except in the words of Gabriel to the prophet Daniel, which are written in the 9th chapter of the prophecy of Daniel.\" \n \n From Maimonede's Sixth Principle of Faith: \n \n \"Third, when a prophet receives prophecy, even though it was only a vision and by means of an angel, he would nevertheless be weakened by it and his body would shudder. He would be stricken with a very great fear almost to the point that his spirit would leave his body, as Daniel said when [the angel] Gavriel (Gabriel) spoke to him, \"No strength remained in me; my robustness changed to pallor, and I could retain no strength... and I was in a deep sleep upon my face, and my face was to the ground\". And as he says later, \"during the vision my joints shuddered and I could retain no strength\". (Daniel 10:8-9, 16). But Moshe, may he rest in peace, was not so, rather, the word came to him and he did not experience trembling and shivering in any way, as it says, \"And HaShem spoke to Moshe face to face, as a man speaks to his friend\" (Shemos [Exodus] 33:11). In other words, just as a man does not experience trembling from the speech of his fellow, Moshe did not tremble from the word even though it was face to face. This was due to his total attachment to the intellect, as we said earlier.\" \n \n The \"Prophet Daniel\" found in the Dead Sea Scrolls:\n \n \"Comment: It is interesting to note that every chapter of Daniel is represented in these manuscripts, except for Dan 12. However, this does not mean that the Book lacked the final chapter at Qumran, since Dan 12:10 is quoted in the Florilegium (4Q174) - (Dead Sea Scrolls), which explicitly tells us that 'it is written in the Book of Daniel the Prophet.' \n \n The Jewish Talmud refers to Daniel as a Prophet\n \n Hatach. Hatach is another name for the prophet Daniel. He was called Hatach (related to the Hebrew word for \"cut\") because he was \"cut down,\" demoted from his position of greatness, which he held at the courts of the previous kings (Megillah 15a). http://www.virtualpurim.org/scripts/...6&Cat=Megillah",

Harrison - Introduction to the Old Testament, pages 1109-1110\n \n What the critics have to believe if Daniel didn't write the Book of Daniel\n \n \"The (critics of Daniel) cannot believe in miracles and predictive prophecy which involve nothing but a simple faith in a wise and mighty and merciful God intervening in behalf of his people for his own glory and their salvation; BUT THEY CAN BELIEVE that a lot of obstreperous and cantankerous Jews who through all their history from Jacob and Esau down to the present time have disagreed and quarreled about almost everything, or nothing, could have accepted, unanimously and without a murmur, in an age when they were enlightened by the brilliant light of Plato's philosophy, and Aristotle's logic, and the criticism of the schools of Alexandria, a forged and ficticious document, untrue to the well remembered facts of their own experience and to the easily ascertained facts concerning their own past history and the history of the Babylonians, Medes, Persians, and Greeks of whom the author (of the book of Daniel) writes.\" R.D. Wilson, Studies in the Book of Daniel, pages 268, 269\n \n \"The Sanhedrin of the second century B.C. was composed of men of the type of John Hyrcanus; men famed for their piety and learning; men who were heirs of all the proud traditions of the Jewish faith, and themselves the sons of successors of the heroes of the noble Maccabean revolt. And yet we are asked to believe (by the critics of Daniel) that these men, with their extremely strict views of inspiration and their intense reverence of for their sacred writings....used their authority to smuggle into the Jewish Canon a book which, ex hypothesi, was a forgery, a literary fraud, and a religious novel of recent date.\" R. Anderson, Daniel in the Critics Den, pages 104-105\n \n Was Daniel a Prophet?\n \n The Jewish Rabbis on Daniel\n \n Rabbi Judah, the main compiler of the Talmud said regarding the times referred to in Daniel's (Messianic) prophecy, \"These times were over long ago.\" (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin.) \n \n In the 12th Century AD, Rabbi Moses Ben Maimon (Maimonides), one of the most respected rabbis in history, and a man who rejected the messianic claim of Yeshua, stated: \n \n \"Daniel has elucidated to us the knowledge of the end times. However, since they are secret, the wise [rabbis] have barred the calculation of the days of Messiah's coming so that the untutored populace will not be led astray when they see that the End Times have already come but there is no sign of the Messiah.\"\n \n Rabbi Moses Abraham Levi said, \"I have examined and searched all the Holy Scriptures and have not found the time for the coming of Messiah clearly fixed, except in the words of Gabriel to the prophet Daniel, which are written in the 9th chapter of the prophecy of Daniel.\" \n \n From Maimonede's Sixth Principle of Faith: \n \n \"Third, when a prophet receives prophecy, even though it was only a vision and by means of an angel, he would nevertheless be weakened by it and his body would shudder. He would be stricken with a very great fear almost to the point that his spirit would leave his body, as Daniel said when [the angel] Gavriel (Gabriel) spoke to him, \"No strength remained in me; my robustness changed to pallor, and I could retain no strength... and I was in a deep sleep upon my face, and my face was to the ground\". And as he says later, \"during the vision my joints shuddered and I could retain no strength\". (Daniel 10:8-9, 16). But Moshe, may he rest in peace, was not so, rather, the word came to him and he did not experience trembling and shivering in any way, as it says, \"And HaShem spoke to Moshe face to face, as a man speaks to his friend\" (Shemos [Exodus] 33:11). In other words, just as a man does not experience trembling from the speech of his fellow, Moshe did not tremble from the word even though it was face to face. This was due to his total attachment to the intellect, as we said earlier.\" \n \n The \"Prophet Daniel\" found in the Dead Sea Scrolls:\n \n \"Comment: It is interesting to note that every chapter of Daniel is represented in these manuscripts, except for Dan 12. However, this does not mean that the Book lacked the final chapter at Qumran, since Dan 12:10 is quoted in the Florilegium (4Q174) - (Dead Sea Scrolls), which explicitly tells us that 'it is written in the Book of Daniel the Prophet.' \n \n The Jewish Talmud refers to Daniel as a Prophet\n \n Hatach. Hatach is another name for the prophet Daniel. He was called Hatach (related to the Hebrew word for \"cut\") because he was \"cut down,\" demoted from his position of greatness, which he held at the courts of the previous kings (Megillah 15a). http://www.virtualpurim.org/scripts/...6&Cat=Megillah\n\n \n 1) Yes, Daniel was found in Qumran. That is not surprising.. Qumran was abandoned 3 centuries after most modern scholars believe the Book of Daniel was written.\n \n 2) Yes, Daniel was considered a prophet. However, that does not mean that the book of Dnaiel was written BY Daniel the prophet. \n \n 3) Yes, the story was about things that happened a long time ago. From the time the Babalyonian Talmud was written, the time of Antichus, in whose reighn the book of Daniel was written, was over a long time ago. \n \n From the Jewish Encylopedia http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=34&letter=D\n \n \n\n The Book of Daniel was written during the persecutions of Israel by the Syrian king Antiochus Epiphanes. This assertion is supported by the following data: The kingdom which is symbolized by the he goat (viii. 5 et seq.) is expressly named as the \"kingdom of Yawan\"-that is, the Grecian kingdom (viii. 21) the great horn being its first king, Alexander the Great (definitely stated in Seder \"Olam R. xxx.), and the little horn Antiochus Epiphanes (175-164). This kingdom was to persecute the host of the saints \"unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings\" (viii. 14, R. V.); that is, \"half-days,\" or 1,150 days; and Epiphanes did, in fact, profane the sanctuary in Jerusalem for about that length of time, from Kislew 15, 168, to Kislew 25,165 (I Macc. i. 57, iv. 52). The little horn described in Dan. viii. 9-12, 23-25 has the same general characteristics as the little horn in vii. 8, 20; hence the same ruler is designated in both passages. The well-known passage ix. 23-27 also points to the same period. The first and imperative rule in interpreting it is to begin the period of the seventy times seven units (A. V. \"seventy weeks\") with the first period of seven (ix. 25), and to let the second period, the \"sixty-two times seven units,\" follow this; forif this second period (the sixty-two weeks) be reckoned as beginning again from the very beginning, the third period, the \"one week,\" must be carried back in the same way. The context demands, furthermore, that the origin of the prediction concerning the rebuilding of Jerusalem be sought in Jer. xxv. 11-13 and the parallel passage, ib. xxix. 10. The \"anointed,\" the \"prince,\" mentioned after the first seven times seven units, must be Cyrus, who is called the anointed of the Lord in Isa. xlv. 1 also. He concluded the first seven weeks of years by issuing the decree of liberation, and the time that elapsed between the Chaldean destruction of Jerusalem (586) and the year 538 was just about forty-nine years. The duration of the sixty-two times seven units (434 years) does not correspond with the time 538-171 (367 years); but the chronological knowledge of that age was not very exact. The Seder 'Olam Zu&#7789;a (ed. Meyer, p. 104) computed the Persian rule to have lasted fifty-two years. This is all the more evident as the last period of seven units must include the seven years 171-165 (see \"Rev. Et. Juives,\" xix. 202 et seq.). This week of years began with the murder of an anointed one (compare Lev. iv. 3 et seq. on the anointing of the priest)-namely, the legitimate high priest Onias III.-and it was in the second half of this week of years that the Temple of the Lord was desecrated by an abomination-the silver altar erected by Antiochus Epiphanes in place of the Lord's altar for burnt offering (see I Macc. i. 54).\n \n",

   "What are you talking about? Your \"support\" does not at all support your original statement. Care to show where little table does? Well?\n \n \n And while you are at it, consider the following.\n \n \n a) Historical INaccuracies in the Bible\n They are numerous. I'll point out only a few.\n \n 1) The Old Testament claims that Joshua destroyed the city of Jericho: but evidence indicates that Jericho was destroyed several centuries before Joshua lived.\n \n 2) The Old Testament (Book of Daniel) claims that Darius the Mede ruled the \"Israelites\" (or Hebrews, or Jews, or whatever) in Babylon (I believe, off the top of my head), yet non-Biblical history tells us there never was a such ruler that would be known as Darius the Mede. That's just one problem with Daniel's historical account: he lists several rulers in the wrong order.\n \n 3) The New Testament (Gospel of Luke) claims that Quirinius was governor of Syria during the reign of King Herod in Palestine, but Flavius Josephus and the Roman historian Tacitus, as well as some inscriptions, indicate that Quirinius wasn't governor then, and that it wasn't until 10 years after King Herod's reign that he was.\n \n \n b) Modifications to the New Testament manuscripts over time\n There are many: both intentional and accidental. You really should read \"Misquoting Jesus\". I can provide a few examples if you don't believe me.\n\n \n The point of my \"little table\" ( as you call it with great bile) is that these documents have more, objectively, from an archeological and historical standpoint, going for them than most documents that historians clearly accept as accurate and pieces of history.\n \n The arguments posted here have been from a narrow viewpoint and contain many assumptions and much argumentation based on the \"oh come on\" logic. \n \n I think I will discontinue discussion with you as you clearly do not want an objective argument.

   "My son called last night and said he had participated in a (global) National Geographic (NG) blood typing / genetic marker project where you pay a fee, provide a blood sample, and NG provides an analysis on your ancestors probable geographical and genetic ancestry. The study deals with the male line / ancestry \"Y\" chromosome hapoltype markers. What was provided to him was that our ancestry traced back to England (which I knew from our family's genealogical investigations), then Scandanavia, India, and eventually to the Levite line of Israel. So I looked around on the Web and found a couple of random articles on similar studies / groups of people. I'm still researching this more.\n \n The fascinating story of how DNA studies confirm an ancient biblical tradition\n \n Solidifying their hypothesis of the Cohens' common ancestor, they found that a particular array of six chromosomal markers was found in 97 of the 106 Cohens tested. This collection of markers has come to be known as the Cohen Modal Hapoltype (CMH) -- the standard genetic signature of the Jewish priestly family. The chances of these findings happening at random is greater than one in 10,000.\n \n The finding of a common set of genetic markers in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Cohanim worldwide clearly indicates an origin pre-dating the separate development of the two communities around 1000 CE. Date calculation based on the variation of the mutations among Cohanim today yields a time frame of 106 generations from the ancestral founder of the line, some 3,300 years -- the approximate time of the Exodus from Egypt, the lifetime of Aaron HaCohen.\n \n http://www.aish.com/societywork/sciencenature/the_cohanim_-_dna_connection.asp\n \n \n Studies of Cohens and Levites\n \n \"More than 2,000 years after they first claimed to have set foot in India, the mystery of the world's most obscure Jewish community - the Marathi-speaking Bene Israel - may finally have been solved with genetic carbon-dating revealing they carry the unusual Moses gene that would make them, literally, the original children of Israel. Four years of DNA tests on the 4,000-strong Bene Israel, now mainly based in Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Ahmedabad, indicates they are probable descendants of a small group of hereditary Israelite priests or Cohanim, according to new results exclusively made available to the Sunday Times of India.... [Tudor] Parfitt, who initiated and led the research, says this is the first concrete proof that 'exiles from Palestine made it as far as India and managed to maintain Judaism in the sea of Hinduism and Islam'... Aharon Daniel expressed doubt about the new findings. 'Many scientists have claimed to have found Israeli or Cohenim genes in tribes in black Africa and other communities around the world and many here were sceptical about this,' he told STOI.... By studying certain genetic markers on the DNA chain, found only in male descendants of Aaron, Moses' elder brother, who founded the line of Jewish priests, the Bene Israel could well claim to be the purest of the pure.\"\n \n Manoj Nair. \"Thane Jews pass the blood test.\" Mumbai Mid-Day Newspaper (July 23, 2002). Excerpts: \n \n \"The news that recent DNA tests have linked India's Bene Israel Jewish community to the patriarch Moses has delighted the small Jewish community in Thane. For hundreds of years, the Bene Israel (meaning Children of Israel), now largely concentrated in and around Thane had fought Western prejudice that denied them their claim as descendants of one of Israel's 12 lost tribes. Now the Jews of Thane, home to 2,000 or 40 per cent of India's Jewry, can hold their head high among the rest of the Jewish community. '...Now science has proved that we are descendants of the Cohanim or hereditary priests. This will improve our status in the Jewish community,' says Ezra Moses, honorary secretary and trustee of Thane's Shaar Hashamaim or Gate of Heaven synagogue.... '...Now the DNA tests have confirmed our claims,' says Rachel Gadkar, a retired schoolteacher who recently published a book in Marathi called 'Bharatiya Bene Israel', that traces the origins of her community.... The current finding that the Bene Israel carry Moses's genes is the result of a research project that started seven years ago.... Sixty-six-year old Phinas Bamnolkar, the hazan or cantor at the Thane synagogue says, 'It was always our claim that we are descendants of Moses. Our claim has now been scientifically proved.'\" \n \n http://www.khazaria.com/genetics/abstracts-cohen-levite.html\n \n I also had heard that modern day Jews are using this same kind of science to discern who the real Levites are so they can be cleared to participate in the new Temple services, once a new Temple is built in Israel.

It is a part of people. \n \n Don't side step the logic by arguing against christianity.\n\n \n \n You see, I am told by many christians to 'accept' it , I have to confess \"Jesus is my lord and savior\", and to believe Jesus is god.\n \n That means, I would have to reject my religious heritage, reject everything I believe in.

The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?\" \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 THE Angel (of the Lord) said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" \n Then he (The Angel of the Lord) said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\" Note only God can remove sin.\n \n \"The testimony of the early Fathers on the theophanies of Christ in the Old Testament is full and conclusive.\n \n Justin Martyr declared: \"Our Christ conversed with Moses out of the bush, in the appearance of fire. And Moses received great strength from Christ, who spake to him in the appearance of fire.\"\n \n Irenaeus wrote: \"The Scripture is full of the Son of God's appearing: sometimes to talk and eat with Abraham, at other times to instruct Noah about the measures of the ark; at another time to seek Adam; at another time to bring down judgment upon Sodom; then again, to direct Jacob in the way; and again, to converse with Moses out of the bush.\" \n \n Tertullian stated, \"It was the Son who judged men from the beginning, destroying that lofty tower, and confounding their languages, punishing the whole world with a flood of waters, and raining fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah, the Lord pouring it down from the Lord: for he always descended to hold converse with men, from Adam even to the patriarchs and prophets, in visions, in dreams, in mirrors, in dark sentences, always preparing his way from the beginning: neither was it possible, that God who conversed with men upon earth, could be any other than that Word which was to be made flesh.\" \n \n Quotations from Richard Watson, Theological Institutes, I, 501,502. Watson also cites Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Theophilus of Antioch, the synod of Antioch, Cyprian, Hilary, St. Basil, and others as holding the same viewpoint of theophanies of Christ in the Old Testament. \n \n http://preceptaustin.org/angel_of_the_lord.htm",

   "You've got a whole slew of such passages to try to explain away:\n \n Judges 13:20-22 \n \n 20 For it came about when the flame went up from the altar toward heaven, that the ANGEL of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground. \n 21 Now the ANGEL of the LORD did not appear to Manoah or his wife again. Then Manoah knew that he was the ANGEL of the LORD. \n 22 So Manoah said to his wife, \"We will surely die, for we have seen God.\"\n \n Zechariah 3:1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before THE angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him. 2 The LORD said to Satan, \"The LORD rebuke you, Satan! The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?\" \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 THE Angel (of the Lord) said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" \n Then he (The Angel of the Lord) said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\" Note only God can remove sin.\n \n \"The testimony of the early Fathers on the theophanies of Christ in the Old Testament is full and conclusive.\n \n Justin Martyr declared: \"Our Christ conversed with Moses out of the bush, in the appearance of fire. And Moses received great strength from Christ, who spake to him in the appearance of fire.\"\n \n Irenaeus wrote: \"The Scripture is full of the Son of God's appearing: sometimes to talk and eat with Abraham, at other times to instruct Noah about the measures of the ark; at another time to seek Adam; at another time to bring down judgment upon Sodom; then again, to direct Jacob in the way; and again, to converse with Moses out of the bush.\" \n \n Tertullian stated, \"It was the Son who judged men from the beginning, destroying that lofty tower, and confounding their languages, punishing the whole world with a flood of waters, and raining fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah, the Lord pouring it down from the Lord: for he always descended to hold converse with men, from Adam even to the patriarchs and prophets, in visions, in dreams, in mirrors, in dark sentences, always preparing his way from the beginning: neither was it possible, that God who conversed with men upon earth, could be any other than that Word which was to be made flesh.\" \n \n Quotations from Richard Watson, Theological Institutes, I, 501,502. Watson also cites Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Theophilus of Antioch, the synod of Antioch, Cyprian, Hilary, St. Basil, and others as holding the same viewpoint of theophanies of Christ in the Old Testament. \n \n http://preceptaustin.org/angel_of_the_lord.htm\n\n \n \n Stop preaching at me.\n \n However, there is nothing in the two scriptures you quoted that have to be 'explained' away. If you read them in context, it has nothing to do with messnice passages. The angel of the lord is just the messanger of the lord. There is no need to read into more into it than was written there.\n \n Same with Zech. You also have to remember in the Jewish fait Ha-shaitan is a title of an angel that is the one that stands to accuse someone of wrong doing. More along the lines of the prosecuting attorney. THe concept of Satan. \n \n If you are specificlaly thinking about the 'Branch', that is generally taken to mean Zerbbabel (see Zech 4:8). Again, the references are complete within \n Zechariah, and you don't need to go to other books written hundreds of years later to reference what is meant.",

Justification is, in Pauline language, synonymous with reconciliation. God is not imputing to men their trespasses, but declaring them righteous. The means (of justification) is the vicarious expiatory death of Jesus Christ. The sole condition is faith ... in Jesus Christ.\" (Hastings 510)\n \n Justification: \"To prove or show to be just; to vindicate as right; to declare free from guilt or blame; to absolve, to clear; to pardon or clear from guilt; to acquit; declare righteous; pronounce sentence of acceptance.\" (Conner 269) Conner goes on to quote J.R. Gregory (\"The Theological Student\"), who defines justification as, 'That act of God by which He accepts as righteous the penitent sinner who believes on Christ for salvation.\"\n \n With the above definitions and quotes as our starting point, we can now delve into one of the most dynamic and unselfish works in the history of creation - the work of Jesus Christ, who became our righteousness because we had none of our own. Author Kevin Conner explains it this way:\n \n \"When Adam sinned, all that he was and all that he did was 'imputed' to the whole, unborn human race. Sin left a debit on the books (Genesis 3:1-16; 2:17; Romans 5:12; 6:23). In Adam all sinned, and all died, spiritually and physically (I Corinthians 15:22). When Christ died on Calvary, the sin of Adam and the whole human race was 'imputed,' or put to Christs' account. And because God imputed our sin to Christ, He suffered our penalty, which was death. All our liabilities were transferred to Him....(and) Christ's righteousness was 'imputed' to us. His righteousness is credited to us, put to our account (Psalm 32:8; Romans 4:8). Justification pronounces the sinner legally innocent, freeing him from condemnation.\" (Conner 272) \n \n Romans chapters 3-4 contain the magnificent statements of justification for those who place their faith in Jesus Christ. Romans 3:21-22 states:\n \n \"But now a righteousness from God, apart from (observing) the\n law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets\n testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in\n Jesus Christ to all who believe.\"\n \n A few sentences later, Paul declares, \"For we maintain that a man is justified (righteous in the eyes of God) by faith apart from observing the law.\" (Romans 3:28)\n \n In Systematic Theology, Wayne Grudem makes the point that, \"the word 'justify' in the Bible indicates that justification is a legal declaration by God. Paul says, \"Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies; who is to condemn?\" (Romans 8:33-34). Grudem continues, \"In God's legal declaration of justification, He specifically declares that we are just in His sight. This (legal) declaration involves two aspects. First, it means that we have no penalty to pay for sin, including past, present, and future sins. The second part of justification is that God must declare us not to be merely natural in His sight but actually to be righteous in His sight. In fact, He must declare us to have the merits of perfect righteousness before Him.\" (Grudem 724-25)\n \n When considering the implications of legal declarations, we have to acknowledge that there is a substantial body of judicial law which was given to us by God. I'm speaking, of course, not only of the Ten Commandments, which comprises the moral law, but also the civil and ceremonial laws of the Old Testament. This 'weighty' and seemingly inflexible array of commandments can surely be viewed as a burdensome yoke of oppression for humanity. In Old and even New Testament times, man considered his salvation as being inexorably linked to his 'keeping' of the law. To the degree that he kept the Lord's rules and regulations, that was the degree to which he calculated his chances of salvation. Yet the keeping of the law was and is an exercise in futility. In Galatians 3:10-11, Paul addresses this contentious issue:\n \n \"All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is\n written: 'Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do every-\n thing written in the Book of the Law.' Clearly, no one is justified\n before God by the law, because, 'The righteous will live by\n faith.\" \n \n The law was powerless to justify anyone righteous in the eyes of God for the simple reason that no mortal human was able to keep the law.\n \n \"There is no one righteous, not even one...no one who seeks God.\n There is no one who does good, not even one.\" (Romans 3:10-11)\n \n \"I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he\n is obligated to obey the whole law.\" (Galatians 5:3)\n \n One might sweat out an entire lifetime trying to keep only one of God's laws, much less all of them. No, keeping the law was not the way to justification. The law had four major purposes:\n \n 1. It shows us the moral character of God\n 2. It serves as a tutor to lead us to Christ.\n 3. It is a guide for Christian living.\n 4. Knowing the law can keep us from suffering the adverse consequences of sin.\n \n SELF- JUSTIFICATION IN SCRIPTURE\n \n It seems clear from scripture that there are only two possible sources of obtaining justification: from one's own self, or from an outside source. Mark chapter 10 gives us an illustration of one man's attempt to justify himself before God (before Jesus). A rich young man is asking Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. In verse 18 Jesus responded by stating, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.\" Jesus goes on to list a number of the Ten Commandments as the standard by which the young man must measure his actions. The young man remarked, \"Teacher, all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" To which Jesus then said, \"One thing you lack. God, sell everything you have and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" The story ends when the young man's face fell and he went away sad, because he had great wealth. \n \n There are a number of lessons in this story. One of these was that the young man was trying to justify himself before Jesus by indicating he was \"keeping the law,\" when in reality he was in violation of the commandment not to make for one's self any idols. Money was the young man's idol, and thus he had already broken the law. Perhaps some other young man might have listened to Jesus reciting the commandments and come to realize that not only could he not keep them in the future, but he had already broken many of them in the past. The conversation might well have then taken a different turn. He might have said something like, \"Teacher, I confess that I have not kept the whole law, and I guess I need to be truthful and tell you that I don't think I can keep it in the future either. What then can I do?\" I'm fairly sure that Jesus would have told him to believe in Him, and then he will receive eternal life. One other note: later in the story of the rich young man Jesus noted that, \"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" When the disciples asked, \"Who then can be saved?\" Jesus responded by saying, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God. With God, all things are possible\" (v. 27). The crux of the message was that it is impossible for a rich man to justify himself, especially when he is engaging in idol worship. Though man might possess great wealth, and achieve tremendous influence in the worldly system, he still has two major problems: one, he still is unable to keep the law; and two, he is completely helpless in justifying himself before God - he needs divine assistance. Only God can justify a person righteous. And it's not by the works of man that this is achieved, but by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n \n Two other examples of men seeking to justify themselves before God can be found in Luke 16:15 and 18:11. It is from these types of Biblical references that the Bible paints an exceedingly clear picture that man, of himself, has no means of self-justification. Only God is able to perform that work.  \n \n PAUL AND JAMES - Are they in agreement with each other?\n \n Much has been said over the years about salvation, justification, and works, and their relationship to each other. I think it is best to look at this from a chronological perspective, starting with the words of the apostle Paul in Ephesians 2:8-9:\n \n \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this\n not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that\n no one can boast.\"\n \n Paul makes the following points:\n \n 1. You are saved by (God's) grace through faith (in Jesus Christ).\n 2. This salvation did not originate from yourselves.\n 3. It is the gift of God (therefore it cannot be earned).\n 4. This salvation is not by any type of works that a man can perform.\n \n \n Back in Romans chapter 4, Paul gave an illustration from Genesis 15:6 concerning Abraham's justification:\n \n \n \"If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something\n to boast about - but not before God. What does the scripture\n say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as\n righteousness.\" (Romans 4:2-3)\n \n Now, going forward to James chapter 2 we read:\n \n \"What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but\n has no deeds (works)? Can such faith save him? Faith, by\n itself, if it is not accompanied by action (works - KJV), is dead.\n You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds\n is useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous\n for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You\n see, a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.\"\n \n James is clearly referring to Genesis chapter 22 as the point where Abraham was justified righteous. What we see here is an illustration that James uses to answer those people who are claiming to have saving faith but no works. Specifically, he states, \"Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, 'Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? (what good is that man's faith?)\" In effect, James is saying, \"You claim to have faith? You claim that God has saved you, put His Holy Spirit in you, and sealed you for redemption? You claim all these things and yet you let the poor go without food or clothes? What kind of a faith is that? I, James, will tell you quite frankly that if you possess the kind of saving faith that results in regeneration and changes a person's life, the Holy Spirit will do a work in you and cause you to follow the Lord's decrees (Ezekiel 36:27) and feed and clothe the poor.\" \n \n Well, what then does Paul state about works as proof that a person's life is changed? Perhaps not surprisingly, he agrees with James:\n \n \"I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove\n their repentance by their deeds.\" (Acts 26:20)\n \n \n So why did Paul state in Ephesians that a person is saved by grace through faith, and not by works? And why did he refer to Genesis 15:6 as the point of Abraham's justification and not Genesis 22? Initial saving faith is the precursor to works. Abraham was not saved (justified righteous) by performing works, he was performing works because he first was saved and regenerated by faith. Works is the result of our regeneration and salvation, not the cause of it. Faith by grace is the antecedent of works. It chronologically occurs first. Once the Holy Spirit indwells a believer at the point of salvation, He starts the process of progressive sanctification (see Ezekiel 36:25-27), and one of the effects of the indwelling Spirit is that of causing, or compelling a person, by a change of heart and mind, to perform works of a Godly nature. James' argument addresses that time period of a person's life, following true salvation and regeneration, when good works is supposed to be in evidence. He is saying, \"Now that you claim to be saved, we should be seeing some good works out of you. However, if these good works are not apparent, then your initial faith was probably not genuine, and you were never, either in the eyes of God, nor in the eyes of man, justified righteous.\" \n \n Another way to illustrate this is to consider the thief on the cross next to Jesus - the one who stated, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" Then Jesus responded by saying, \"I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise\" (Luke 23:42-43). It was at this particular moment that the repentant thief received his salvation, and was justified righteous in the eyes of God. This particular moment would also coincide with Genesis 15:6, when Abraham believed God and it was credited (imputed to his account) as righteousness, and would also coincide with what Paul stated in Ephesians 2:8-9. Note that there is no evidence that the thief had performed any good works in his life. To the contrary, his works were more of a criminal nature than a Godly nature. That was the very reason he was being crucified. Even as he initially hung from his cross, he heaped insults on the Lord (Mark 15:32). But then the sky darkened, his pain and suffering magnified, and the words Jesus spoke on the cross hit their appointed target, and the thief had a change of heart and believed on the Lord. At that point, the thief received his salvation and justification. \n \n Now, if by some means the thief could have come down from the cross, prior to death, and continued on with his life, then eventually his saving faith would have produced good works (corresponding to Abraham in Genesis 22 and James chapter 2). There is a progression whereby salvation leads to good works. In the eyes of God, Abraham was genuinely justified righteous in Genesis 15:6. Because his faith was genuine, it produced his works in Genesis 22, whereby he was seen as being justified righteous in the eyes of men. James and Paul, though they approach the issue of justification from two different points in time and two different perspectives (the perspective of God and the perspective of man), nevertheless are in total agreement with each other.\n \n Jesus is Lord!",

Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, to order it and establish it with judgement and justice from that time forward, even forever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this. (Isaiah 9:6-7)\n \n THE RABBINIC WRITINGS\n \n For to us a Son is born, to us a Son is given: and he shall receive the law upon him to keep it; and his name is called from of Old, Wonderful, Counsellor, Eloha, the Mighty, abiding to Eternity, the Messiah, because peace shall be multiplied on us in His days.

Kahana said: His name is \"the Lord\" [Heb: YHWH, Jehovah, Adonai], as it is stated, And this is His name whereby he shall be called, The Lord [Heb: YHWH] is our righteousness'. (Midrash Rabbah, Lamentations 1:16)\n \n THE NEW TESTAMENT\n \n In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it...\n \n And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. (John 1:1-14)\n \n ... Messiah Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus the Messiah is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

And they said: 'So do, as thou hast said.'\n \n 6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said: 'Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.'\n \n 7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hastened to dress it.\n \n 8 And he took curd, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.\n \n 9 And they said unto him: 'Where is Sarah thy wife?' And he said: 'Behold, in the tent.'\n \n 10 And He said: 'I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.' And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.--\n \n 11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.--\n \n 12 And Sarah laughed within herself, saying: 'After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?'\n \n 13 And HaShem said unto Abraham: 'Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying: Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?\n \n 14 Is any thing too hard for HaShem. At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.'\n \n 15 Then Sarah denied, saying: 'I laughed not'; for she was afraid. And He said: 'Nay; but thou didst laugh.'\n \n 16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked out toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n \n 17 And HaShem said: 'Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing;\n \n 18 seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\n \n 19 For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of HaShem, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that HaShem may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him.'\n \n 20 And HaShem said: 'Verily, the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and, verily, their sin is exceeding grievous.\n \n 21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto Me; and if not, I will know.'\n \n 22 And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before HaShem.\n \n 23 And Abraham drew near, and said: 'Wilt Thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?\n \n 24 Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt Thou indeed sweep away and not forgive the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?\n \n 25 That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the judge of all the earth do justly?'\n \n 26 And HaShem said: 'If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will forgive all the place for their sake.'\n \n 27 And Abraham answered and said: 'Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the L-rd, who am but dust and ashes.\n \n 28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous; wilt Thou destroy all the city for lack of five?' And He said: 'I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.'\n \n 29 And he spoke unto Him yet again, and said: 'Peradventure there shall be forty found there.' And He said: 'I will not do it for the forty's sake.'\n \n 30 And he said: 'Oh, let not the L-rd be angry, and I will speak. Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.'

   "Educating Thomas Paine and his Underlings - Part 1\n \n ONE GOD OR A TRIUNE GOD?\n \n Christianity holds that while the Old Testament is still true in every respect, the Old Testament clearly reveals that God is a unified and triune God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and that the Messiah is clearly God the Son. In essence, Christianity agrees with Judaism that there is only one God, but differs with Judaism in that this one God is manifested in three persons. To the Christian, God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one in purpose and Spirit, yet each seems to have their own individual manifestations. To this end, I will now provide SOME of the Old Testament scriptural evidence for the triune God.\n \n EXAMPLE # 1: The \"Shema\" Verse\n \n For most Jewish people, the \"Shema\" is the foundational verse for the concept of a monotheistic God. It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 actually establishes for many students of the Bible, the plurality of God. In fact, the Shema verse actually presents one of the strongest arguments for the tri-unity of God in the entire Bible. Here's why. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which in many scriptural passages demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n In Ezra 2:64, the Bible records, \"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand, three hundred and threescore.\" The words translated \"whole congregation\" in English are derived from the single Hebrew word echad. Again, a singular entity (one congregation) is comprised of more than one individual.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies strict singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). He chose echad to make his point, so that it might be understood there is a plurality in union. \n \n \n EXAMPLE # 2: \"Elohim\"\n \n In the very first verse of the Bible we find a statement which clearly illustrates the plurality of God.\n \n \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\"\n Genesis 1:1\n \n The Hebrew word that is used for God in Genesis 1:1 is the word Elohim, a derivitive of the word El. \"El\" denotes God in the singular sense, while \"Elohim\" is the plural notation for God. Of the 2,750 times that these words are used in the Old Testament, Elohim, the plural form, is used in 2,500 cases, and is used 32 times in the accounts of the Genesis creation of the heavens and the earth.\n \n Another excellent example of the word Elohim used in a critical text is found in Exodus 20:1, where the Lord is giving the Ten Commandments to Moses and the people of Israel:\n \n \"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt.\"\n \n Grammatically, it would be acceptable to say, \"I am the Lord your Gods.\" Such examples as these, which occur 2,500 times in the Old Testament, raises the following question: If the scriptures are the divine word of God, why would the Lord consistently select the plural form of God - Elohim, to refer to Him in a plural sense? Why would He not use the singular form, El, in each instance? This is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed for those who believe in a monotheistic God.\n \n EXAMPLE #3: Plurality in Personal Pronouns\n \n Plurality in personal pronouns (such as \"us\" and \"our\") when used in reference to the Lord, lends additional documentary evidence for the plurality of God. A good case in point is Genesis 1:26:\n \n \"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,\n and let have dominion over the fist of the sea, and over the birds\n of the air, and over the livestock, and over all the earth.\"\n \n Here, we see a conversation that is taking place prior to the creation of man. Who is this person or persons with whom God is conversing? First, this 'person' or 'persons' is able to communicate with God in His own realm of timeless eternity. Because man had not yet been created, He was not speaking to someone of earthly intelligence, but someone in the heavenly, supernatural and eternal realm.\n \n Secondly, this person or persons with whom God is communicating apparently has the same kind of creative ability as God (\"Let us make\"). This clearly implies a cooperative effort between God (Elohim - plural) and the person or person with whom God is speaking.\n \n And finally, the person or persons with whom God is speaking is comparable, or identical, with God (\"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\").\n \n When confronted with this passage, modern Jewish rabbis often claim that God is speaking with angels. However, this explanation fails to address a number of problems. First, there is no indication found anywhere in the Bible that says angels can create life. Secondly, nowhere is it indicated that angels were ever made in the image and likeness of God. And finally, there is no indication from scripture that mankind was ever made in the likeness of angels. \n \n Just one more example. In Genesis chapter 11, God is looking down at man's attempt to build the Tower of Babel to make a name for themselves. In verse 7 God states:\n \n \"Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will\n not understand one another.\"\n \n Once more, the personal pronoun \"us\" is used as a reference to God. Note that in verse 11:5 it is \"the Lord\" that is referred to when \"us\" is later used (\"The Lord came down to see the city\"). \n \n \n EXAMPLE 4: A PLURAL CREATOR\n \n The notion of a plural Creator is seen in Isaiah 54:5, where the prophet states:\n \n \"For thy 'Maker' is thy husband, Jehovah of Hosts is His name.\"\n \n In the above verse, the word \"Maker\" is the Hebrew word \"asa,\" which denotes the plurality of the entity involved in the creative process.\n \n EXAMPLE #5: The Holy Spirit is a Person - God!\n \n While in Genesis 1:2 we see the \"Spirit of God\" moving upon the face of the waters during creation (remember God as \"Elohim,\" a plural creator), there is a very important and often overlooked verse in which the prophet Isaiah reveals that the Holy Spirit is more than just some type of spiritual force. Isaiah 63:10 reads,\n \n \"But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore He was\n turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.\"\n \n The word \"vexed,\" as used above, is the Hebrew word \"atsab,\" which means \"to worry, pain, or anger; to grieve, hurt, or make sorry\" (Zodhiates Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary section, page 91). The question, of course, is \"How can some inanimate force be angered or grieved, as we see occurred in the above passage? Only if the Holy Spirit was alive and possessed personal attributes could He experience these types of emotions.\" The Holy Spirit must therefore be a person. \n \n Another important verse that shows that the Holy Spirit is one of the \"Creators\" is found in Job 33:4, which reads,\n \n \"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty\n hath given me life.\"\n \n Obviously, the Holy Spirit must possess intelligence in order to take part in the creative process. Other \"personal\" attributes of the Holy Spirit are as follows:\n \n 1. The Holy Spirit \"testifies\" (Nehemiah 9:30).\n 2. The Spirit \"instructs\" (Nehemiah 9:20).\n 3. The Spirit \"strives with men\" (Genesis 6:3).\n 4. The Spirit sends messengers (Isaiah 48:16).\n 5. The Spirit enabled Joseph to interpret Pharoah's dreams (Genesis 41:38).\n 6. The Spirit gives wisdom (Exodus 28:3; 31:1-6; 35:31).\n 7. The Holy Spirit is the \"Spirit of Wisdom\" (Isaiah 11:2).\n 8. He is the Spirit of Knowledge (Isaiah 11:2)\n \n Notice clearly that all of the things that the Holy Spirit does requires intelligence of the variety that only God alone can possess. This ties God and the Holy Spirit together in a most closely-knit and inseparable unity.",

   "Educating Thomas Paine and his Underlings - Part 2\n \n \n EXAMPLE #6: The Son of God - The Messiah\n \n In Isaiah chapter nine, we read a number of magnificent verses that proclaim the coming Messiah as being God:\n \n \"For unto us a child is born,\n to us a SON is given,\n and the government will be on His shoulders.\" (Isaiah 9:6)\n \n Who is this child that will be born?\n \n \"He will be called Wonderful Counselor,\n Mighty God, Everlasting Father,\n Prince of Peace.\n Of the increase of His government and peace\n there will be no end.\n He will reign on David's throne,\n and over his kingdom,\n establishing and upholding it with\n justice and righteousness,\n from that time on and forever.\" (Isaiah 9:6-7)\n \n How is it that God can be born as a child? This \"child\" that is called \"Mighty God\" is also mentioned in Isaiah 7:14:\n \n \"Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: The virgin will\n be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call Him,\n 'Immanuel.'\" \n \n Again, God is seen as one who is \"born.\" The name, \"Immanual,\" means \"God with us\" in Hebrew (note that God has many names in the Old Testament: \"Adonai,\" meaning \"Lord\" (Malachi 1:6); The \"Rock\" (Deut. 32:4 and Psalm 18:2); \"Thy Refuge and thy Fortress\" (Psalm 91); The \"Redeemer\" (Job 19:25); etc.). By the way, Job 19:25 states, \"For I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end He will stand upon the earth.\"\n \n \n Psalm two is another not-so-subtle hint that God has a beloved son:\n \n \"Why do the nations conspire....\n against the Lord and His Anointed One?\n I have installed my King on Zion, my Holy Hill.\n He (the Lord) said to me, 'You are my Son;\n today I have become your Father.\n I will make the nations your inheritance,\n the ends of the earth your possession.\n You will rule them with an iron scepter;\n You will dash them to pieces like pottery.\"\n \n Jewish thought concludes that these verses must be referring to King David or King Solomon, when the king reigns forever on his eternal throne. Yet if you remember in Isaiah 9:6-7 a child will be born who will be called \"Mighty God,\" \"Everlasting Father,\" and \"Prince of Peace,\" who will reign on King David's throne. Who is this person? Is it David that will rule over the nations with an iron sceptor and subdue his enemies, or is it someone else? Well, David knows who this person is, and David calls Him, \"Lord:\" \n \n \"The Lord says to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your\n enemies a footstool for your feet.\" (Psalm 110:1)\n \n Jesus once asked the pharisees of His day, \"Who do you say the Messiah is?\" The pharisees responded, \"The Son of David.\" Jesus replied, \"How then can David, speaking in the Spirit, call Him Lord when he says, 'The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. If he is David's son, how then does David call Him 'Lord?\" The answer, of course, is that the Messiah will be born of an earthly mother (a virgin to be given in marriage to a descendant of King David) and conceived by a heavenly Father (God). \n \n Psalm 72 refers to this individual as the \"Royal Son\" who will \"Endure as long as the sun,\" and whom \"All kings shall bow down to,\" and through whom \"All nations shall be blessed\" (Pssalm 72:1, 5, 11, 17).\n \n \n DANIEL'S VISION OF THE 'SON OF MAN'\n \n In Daniel chapter nine, starting with verse 24, the prophet Daniel gives a critical, time-sensitive prophecy concerning when the Jewish Messiah shall arrive in Jerusalem. This prophecy is known as the \"Seventy Weeks of Daniel.\" But a second vision by Daniel records another individual of similar stature approaching the throne of Almighty God.\n \n In Daniel 7:13-14 we read:\n \n \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a\n son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the\n Ancient of Days (Jehovah God) and was led into His presence. He\n was given authority, glory, and sovereign power; all peoples, nations,\n and men of every language worshipped him. His dominion is an\n everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one\n that will never be destroyed.\"\n \n Remarkable. Jesus referred to Himself as the \"Son of Man\" numerous times (Mark 14:21, etc.). In the gospel of Mark 14:62, Jesus was specifically asked if He was the Christ, the Son of the 'Blessed One.' Jesus replied, \"I AM (note: this was the name Jehovah revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai when Moses asked the Lord His name). And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One (note Psalm 110:1) and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" \n \n Here is that same individual spoken of in Isaiah 9:6-7 who will reign on David's throne, who will have the sovereign power of Almighty God, and whom the peoples and nations of the earth will worship. He is approaching the throne of the \"Ancient of Days,\" who is clearly Jehovah God (see Daniel 7:9-10), and is about to set up his eternal kingdom. Is this not the eternal Messiah, the Son of God? If King David were to reign on this throne, would he desire that all people worship him, or would he do as he did on earth and direct the people's worship towards Almighty God? We will look to the prophet Jeremiah for still another clue.\n \n If by now there are any doubts that God will raise up a Lord (who is someone other than David) who will reign on David's throne, then the prophet Jeremiah foretells who this individual is:\n \n \"The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will raise up to\n David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely, and do\n what is just and right in the land. In His days Judah will be saved\n and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which He will be\n called: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.\" (Jeremiah 23:5-7)\n \n Remember, in Jewish theology there can be only one Lord. Yet in the above verse the Lord God is raising up another Lord who is called, \"The Lord our Righteousness.\" Certainly neither David, who committed murder and adultery, or Solomon, who sought after the idols of his many wives, nor any other Jewish King could become the \"Righteousness\" of the people. This is a divine individual, and is the same person that Isaiah and King David refer to as, \"Lord.\" Where will this \"Lord\" be born?\n \n In Micah 5:2, Micah prophesies concerning a coming king:\n \n \"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the\n clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler\n over Israel, whose origins are from everlasting, from ancient\n times.\"\n \n Whoever this coming king is, he will have an eternal heritage - he will have origins from everlasting ages of time. The verse certainly suggests he is eternal. This predates the first man, Adam, and clearly suggests that this individual must have divine or heavenly characteristics uncommon with mortal man. \n \n In all these things - in all these examples, we clearly see that the God of Israel is more than just a monotheistic entity. In fact, the evidence testifies against God being a singular entity, and clearly depicts a unified, Triune God - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n \n It's too bad Thomas Paine was such a slacker when it came to understanding God's Word!",

He chose echad to make his point, so that it might be understood there is a plurality in union. \n \n \n EXAMPLE # 2: \"Elohim\"\n \n In the very first verse of the Bible we find a statement which clearly illustrates the plurality of God.\n \n \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\"\n Genesis 1:1\n \n The Hebrew word that is used for God in Genesis 1:1 is the word Elohim, a derivitive of the word El. \"El\" denotes God in the singular sense, while \"Elohim\" is the plural notation for God. Of the 2,750 times that these words are used in the Old Testament, Elohim, the plural form, is used in 2,500 cases, and is used 32 times in the accounts of the Genesis creation of the heavens and the earth.\n \n Another excellent example of the word Elohim used in a critical text is found in Exodus 20:1, where the Lord is giving the Ten Commandments to Moses and the people of Israel:\n \n \"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt.\"\n \n Grammatically, it would be acceptable to say, \"I am the Lord your Gods.\" Such examples as these, which occur 2,500 times in the Old Testament, raises the following question: If the scriptures are the divine word of God, why would the Lord consistently select the plural form of God - Elohim, to refer to Him in a plural sense? Why would He not use the singular form, El, in each instance? This is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed for those who believe in a monotheistic God.\n \n EXAMPLE #3: Plurality in Personal Pronouns\n \n Plurality in personal pronouns (such as \"us\" and \"our\") when used in reference to the Lord, lends additional documentary evidence for the plurality of God. A good case in point is Genesis 1:26:\n \n \"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,\n and let have dominion over the fist of the sea, and over the birds\n of the air, and over the livestock, and over all the earth.\"\n \n Here, we see a conversation that is taking place prior to the creation of man. Who is this person or persons with whom God is conversing? First, this 'person' or 'persons' is able to communicate with God in His own realm of timeless eternity. Because man had not yet been created, He was not speaking to someone of earthly intelligence, but someone in the heavenly, supernatural and eternal realm.\n \n Secondly, this person or persons with whom God is communicating apparently has the same kind of creative ability as God (\"Let us make\"). This clearly implies a cooperative effort between God (Elohim - plural) and the person or person with whom God is speaking.\n \n And finally, the person or persons with whom God is speaking is comparable, or identical, with God (\"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\").\n \n When confronted with this passage, modern Jewish rabbis often claim that God is speaking with angels. However, this explanation fails to address a number of problems. First, there is no indication found anywhere in the Bible that says angels can create life. Secondly, nowhere is it indicated that angels were ever made in the image and likeness of God. And finally, there is no indication from scripture that mankind was ever made in the likeness of angels. \n \n Just one more example. In Genesis chapter 11, God is looking down at man's attempt to build the Tower of Babel to make a name for themselves. In verse 7 God states:\n \n \"Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will\n not understand one another.\"\n \n Once more, the personal pronoun \"us\" is used as a reference to God. Note that in verse 11:5 it is \"the Lord\" that is referred to when \"us\" is later used (\"The Lord came down to see the city\"). \n \n \n EXAMPLE 4: A PLURAL CREATOR\n \n The notion of a plural Creator is seen in Isaiah 54:5, where the prophet states:\n \n \"For thy 'Maker' is thy husband, Jehovah of Hosts is His name.\"\n \n In the above verse, the word \"Maker\" is the Hebrew word \"asa,\" which denotes the plurality of the entity involved in the creative process.\n \n EXAMPLE #5: The Holy Spirit is a Person - God!\n \n While in Genesis 1:2 we see the \"Spirit of God\" moving upon the face of the waters during creation (remember God as \"Elohim,\" a plural creator), there is a very important and often overlooked verse in which the prophet Isaiah reveals that the Holy Spirit is more than just some type of spiritual force. Isaiah 63:10 reads,\n \n \"But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore He was\n turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.\"\n \n The word \"vexed,\" as used above, is the Hebrew word \"atsab,\" which means \"to worry, pain, or anger; to grieve, hurt, or make sorry\" (Zodhiates Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary section, page 91). The question, of course, is \"How can some inanimate force be angered or grieved, as we see occurred in the above passage? Only if the Holy Spirit was alive and possessed personal attributes could He experience these types of emotions.\" The Holy Spirit must therefore be a person. \n \n Another important verse that shows that the Holy Spirit is one of the \"Creators\" is found in Job 33:4, which reads,\n \n \"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty\n hath given me life.\"\n \n Obviously, the Holy Spirit must possess intelligence in order to take part in the creative process. Other \"personal\" attributes of the Holy Spirit are as follows:\n \n 1. The Holy Spirit \"testifies\" (Nehemiah 9:30).\n 2. The Spirit \"instructs\" (Nehemiah 9:20).\n 3. The Spirit \"strives with men\" (Genesis 6:3).\n 4. The Spirit sends messengers (Isaiah 48:16).\n 5. The Spirit enabled Joseph to interpret Pharoah's dreams (Genesis 41:38).\n 6. The Spirit gives wisdom (Exodus 28:3; 31:1-6; 35:31).\n 7. The Holy Spirit is the \"Spirit of Wisdom\" (Isaiah 11:2).\n 8. He is the Spirit of Knowledge (Isaiah 11:2)\n \n Notice clearly that all of the things that the Holy Spirit does requires intelligence of the variety that only God alone can possess. This ties God and the Holy Spirit together in a most closely-knit and inseparable unity.\n\n \n \n Oh yes, the cut/paste from some site or other, with fake references, out of context quotes, and irrelavencies.\n \n None, of course, means anything.",

   "Christianity holds that while the Old Testament is still true in every respect, the Old Testament clearly reveals that God is a unified and triune God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and that the Messiah is clearly God the Son.\n\n \n The above demonstrates a contradiction. If the OT is held by Christians to be \"true in every respect\", there is no justification for claiming that the OT defines or even suggests a triune god. Quite the contrary - the Tanakh goes to great lengths to emphasize the singular nature of God. This is the bedrock of Judaism. For example...\n \n Isa 43:11 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.\n \n Isa 45:6 I am the LORD, and there is none else.\n \n De 4:35 Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.\n \n 1sa 2:2 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee\n \n Notice the repeated references to the singular. \n \n Finally...\n \n John 20:17 but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\n \n ...wherein the risen Jesus proclaims his humanity as well as making a distinction between himself and God.\n \n \n \nFor most Jewish people, the \"Shema\" is the foundational verse for the concept of a monotheistic God. It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 actually establishes for many students of the Bible, the plurality of God. In fact, the Shema verse actually presents one of the strongest arguments for the tri-unity of God in the entire Bible.\n\n \n Translation: When all else fails, try to redefine the meaning of words, kinda like throwing some slop against the wall to see whatever might stick. The thrust of this argument (provided by Christians) is that Jews understand neither their own scriptures nor their own language.\n \n Deut 17:6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one (echad) witness he shall not be put to death.",

By the argument it contains against a particular Providence, though you allow a general Providence, you strike at the foundations of all religion. For without the belief of a Providence, that takes cognizance of, guards, and guides, and may favor particular persons, there is no motive to worship a Deity, to fear his displeasure, or to pray for his protection. I will not enter into any discussion of your principles, though you seem to desire it. At present I shall only give you my opinion, that, though your reasonings are subtile and may prevail with some readers, you will not succeed so as to change the general sentiments of mankind on that subject, and the consequence of printing this piece will be, a great deal of odium drawn upon yourself, mischief to you, and no benefit to others. He that spits against the wind, spits in his own face. \n But, were you to succeed, do you imagine any good would be done by it? You yourself may find it easy to live a virtuous life, without the assistance afforded by religion; you having a clear perception of the advantages of virtue, and the disadvantages of vice, and possessing a strength of resolution sufficient to enable you to resist common temptations. But think how great a portion of mankind consists of weak and ignorant men and women, and of inexperienced, inconsiderate youth of both sexes, who have need of the motives of religion to restrain them from vice, to support their virtue, and retain them in the practice of it till it becomes habitual, which is the great point for its security. And perhaps you are indebted to her originally, that is, to your religious education, for the habits of virtue upon which you now justly value yourself. You might easily display your excellent talents of reasoning upon a less hazardous subject, and thereby obtain a rank with our most distinguished authors. For among us it is not necessary, as among the Hottentots, that a youth, to be raised into the company of men, should prove his manhood by beating his mother.\n \n I would advise you, therefore, not to attempt unchaining the tiger, but to burn this piece before it is seen by any other person; whereby you will save yourself a great deal of mortification by the enemies it may raise against you, and perhaps a good deal of regret and repentance. If men are so wicked with religion, what would they be if without it. I intend this letter itself as a proof of my friendship, and therefore add no professions to it; but subscribe simply yours,\n \n B. Franklin",

I've posted on this many times before in various forums.\n \n From the U.S. Library of Congress\n \n Deism\n \n \"Deism\" is a loosely used term that describes the views of certain English and continental thinkers. These views attracted a following in Europe toward the latter part of the seventeenth century and gained a small but influential number of adherents in America in the late eighteenth century. Deism stressed morality and rejected the orthodox Christian view of the divinity of Christ, often viewing him as nothing more than a \"sublime\" teacher of morality. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams are usually considered the leading American deists. There is no doubt that they subscribed to the deist credo that all religious claims were to be subjected to the scrutiny of reason. \"Call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion,\" Jefferson advised. Other founders of the American republic, including George Washington, are frequently identified as deists, although the evidence supporting such judgments is often thin. Deists in the United States never amounted to more than a small percentage of an evangelical population.\n \n http://loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel02.html \n \n There were also compelling arguments made against that kind of \"logic\" in those days:\n \n Christianity Not Mysterious: or, a Treatise shewing, That there is nothing in the Gospel Contrary to Reason, . . . . \n John Toland London: 1696\n \n In addition, one of the standard definitions of Deism, then and now, is this: \n \n Deism is defined in Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1941, as: \"[From Latin Deus, God.Deity] The doctrine or creed of a Deist.\" And Deist is defined in the same dictionary as: \"One who believes in the existence of a God or supreme being but denies revealed religion, basing his belief on the light of nature and reason.\" \n \n Along these lines many would argue that, according to 18th century deism, God would not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. He was like the old watchmaker who created / wound up the universe and then sat back and didn't involve himself further. \n \n And while Paine may have argued against \"revealed religion,\" many of the individuals who today classify Jefferson, Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and other founding fathers as strict \"deists\" have to contend with any number of quotations from these individuals, which to the contrary, show that they believed God did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. \n \n Anyway, the Library of Congress, in the link above, confirms that \"Deists in the United States never amounted to more than a small percentage of an evangelical population.\"  \n \n I think that puts it in its proper perspective.",

Basically I have stated that many - even most - Jews have blown it when it comes to recognizing their Messiah, Jesus Christ. They rely more on the often-contradictory commentaries of Talmudic rabbis than they do on the actual Scriptures that are supposed to be the foundation of the Talmud. And that's a fact. \n \n But this kind of claim you have made above is highly disingenuous on your part, since for over six years now you have basically argued that we Biblically-based Christians do not understand our own Scriptures. If we did we'd think more like you and those charlatans Spong, Armstrong, and Crossan.\n \n \nYou've no doubt seen attempts by some Christians here to redefine the Sh'ma (Deut 6:4 ) by claiming that it really really refers to a Trinity, the implication being that Jews don't understand their own language.\n\n \n Well, let's take a look at that so we can see where you are again missing the boat:\n \n The \"Shema\" Verse\n \n For most Jewish people, the \"Shema\" is the foundational verse for the concept of a monotheistic God. It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 actually establishes a credible argument for the plurality of God. Here's why. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is often known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which in many cases (see examples below) demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" But it is not used in the Shema!!  So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies strict singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). Hence, the Shema verse, at best, does not in any way exclude a Triune God. \n \n Orion's brand of Judaism conveniently tries to sweep this under the rug.",

But I've known him for several years during which he has demonstrated his ability to offer informed opinion on aspects of Judaism.\n\n \n Trebor claims to be a Reform Jew, which even many Orthodox Jews say doesn't represent mainstream Judaism. Trebor has failed to clarify for us Reform Judaism's amazing hodgepodge of beliefs that are all over the board, including even non-belief! Some Reform Jews say there is a Creator and some say there is no creator. There is no official recognition of an afterlife, or even a Jewish Messiah. If there is an afterlife, it's based on rewarding works - believing in God is not even necessary. This is somewhat humerous since who is it that's supposedly going to reward those works if God doesn't exist?). As noted in their beliefs, \"Most believe God is forgiving of all.\" One has to wonder then if Reform Jews will feel at ease in eternity with Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin and other serial murderers running loose in their midst? In addition, rather than embrace traditional Judaism which teaches that Homosexual relations are a sin, Reform Jews openly endorse gay sex, saying such behavior is God-created! What's more, reincarnation is in too if they want, which is a documented pagan belief contrary to reason and traditional Judaism. In short, Trebor's Reform Judaism is pretty much whatever people want to believe, based on their man-made whims. Trebor has consistently failed to answer questions such as, \"What happens to you if you are not a Reform Jew,\" and, \"How many works, and what kind of works, does it take to be rewarded with the afterlife\"? IMO, Trebor's Reform Judaism is a hodgepodge philosophical structure which is ill-defined, often contradictory to traditional Judaism, etc., man-created, and can certainly incorporate and embrace pagan beliefs and even subjective, politically-correct dogma.\n \n If Trebor can't clarify and document his positions on these issues, then it's highly doubtful we can trust his other views and interpretations of normative Judaism.",

If we did we'd think more like you and those charlatans Spong, Armstrong, and Crossan.\n \n \n \n Well, let's take a look at that so we can see where you are again missing the boat:\n \n The \"Shema\" Verse\n \n For most Jewish people, the \"Shema\" is the foundational verse for the concept of a monotheistic God. It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 actually establishes a credible argument for the plurality of God. Here's why. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is often known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which in many cases (see examples below) demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" But it is not used in the Shema!!  So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies strict singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). Hence, the Shema verse, at best, does not in any way exclude a Triune God. \n \n Orion's brand of Judaism conveniently tries to sweep this under the rug.\n\n \n \n Oh yes, the lies about the schema again..\n \n Yo don't gie it a break do you. Like Orion said,if you really want to know Jewish scripture, you can't ask a jew, you have to ask an evangalisitc Christian.\n \n One means one. Yes, it can mean a compound one.. if it is in the right context, but , the Shema is very distinctly a singular one. It is not 3 in one, It is one, singular.

My point, my big quesiton, is this. If God wrote this infallible book, if he wants us to follow it, then why doesn't he make that clear?\n \n I'm going to guess your response: \"It is, to many people.\" My point is that it isn't clear to most people. No religion is in the majority, there's nothing even close to concensus on what God's will is. If God has a way in which he wants us to live then why bother trying to tell us what it is at all if he won't tell us clearly?",

It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 actually establishes a credible argument for the plurality of God. Here's why. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is often known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which in many cases (see examples below) demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" But it is not used in the Shema!! So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies strict singularity (yachid), or, in many scriptural instances, a plurality in oneness (echad).

   "Yes, that is true.. there are times that elohim can be plural. \n \n However, when refering to GOD.. Ha-shem, the verb is always singualr.\n\n \n Not even your own rabbis agree on that:\n \n The Trinity As Taught by the Ancient Jewish Sages\n \n Do the ancient Jewish books such as the Zohar and the Targums actually refer to the Trinity and clearly describe the plural nature of God? Consider the following statements:\n \n \"How can they (the three) be One? Are they verily One, because we call them One ? How Three can be One, can only be known through the revelation of the Holy Spirit.\"7\n \n According to the Zohar, one day Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai was teaching his son Rabbi Eliezer about the mystery of the triune nature of God. He instructed his pupil by saying, \"Come and see the mystery of the word hwhy, Jehova: there are three steps, each existing by itself; nevertheless they are One, and so united that one cannot be separated from the other.\"8\n \n Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai indicates in another passage of the Zohar that these three steps as revealed in Elohim Myhla (God) are three substantive beings or three divine persons united in one.\n \n The Ancient Holy One is revealed with three Heads, which are united in One, and that Head is thrice exalted. The Ancient Holy one is described as being Three; it is because the other Lights emanating from Him are included in the Three. Yet the Ancient One is described as being two. The Ancient One includes these two. He is the Crown of all that is exalted; the Chief of the chief, so exalted, that He cannot be known to perfection. Thus the other lights are two complete ones, yet is the Ancient Holy One described complete as one, and He is one, positively one; thus are the other lights united and glorified in because they are one.9\n \n Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai wrote a fascinating passage recorded in the Zohar that is as clear a discussion of the mystery of the Trinity as you could find in any Christian theology text. Rabbi Simeon comments on the text found in Deuteronomy 32:39: \"See now that I, I am he, and Elohim is not with me.\"10\n \n He said: \"Friends, here are some profound mysteries which I desire to reveal to you now that permission has been given to utter them. Who is it that says, 'See now that I, I am He?' This is the Cause which is above all those on high, that which is called the Cause of causes. It is above those other causes, since none of those causes does anything till it obtains permission from that which is above it, as we pointed out above in respect to the expression, 'Let us make man.' 'Us' certainly refers to two, of which one said to the other above it, 'Let us make,' nor did it do anything save with the permission and direction of the one above it, while the one above did nothing without consulting its colleague. But that which is called 'the Cause above all causes,' which has no superior or even equal, as it is written, 'To whom shall ye liken me, that I should be equal?' (referring to Isaiah 40:25), said, 'See now that I, I am he, and Elohim is not with me,' from whom he should take counsel, like that of which it is written, 'and God said, Let us make man.'\"\n \n Another book written by Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, known as The Propositions of the Zohar, records the mystery of the Shechinah glory of God in these words.\n \n . . . the exalted Shechinah comprehends the Three highest Sephiroth; of Him (God) it is said, (Ps. lxii. 12), \"God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this.\" Once and twice means the Three exalted Sephiroth, of whom it is said: Once, once, and once; that is, Three united in One. This is the mystery.11\n \n Another famous Jewish scholar, Rabbi Eliezer Hakkalir, who lived at the time of Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, also taught the scriptural doctrine that there were three distinct Beings revealed in the one unified Godhead. In his commentary on Genesis 1:1, Rabbi Hakkalir wrote the following:\n \n When God created the world, He created it through the Three Sephiroth, namely, through Sepher, Sapher and Vesaphur, by which the Three twywh (Beings) are meant . . . The Rabbi, my Lord Teacher of blessed memory, explained Sepher, Sapher, and Sippur, to be synonymous to Ja, Jehovah, and Elohim meaning to say, that the world was created by these three names.12\n \n Rabbi Bechai, in his commentary on Genesis 1:1 (p. 1, col. 2) explained that the word Elohim Myhla is compounded of two words, Mh and la, that is, \"These are God.\" The plural is expressed by the letter jod (y).\n \n Another extraordinary reference to the Trinity is found in the Zohar :\n \n Here is the secret of two names combined which are completed by a third and become one again. \"And God said Let us make Man.\" It is written, \"The secret of the Lord is to them that fear him\" (Psalm 25:34). That most reverend Elder opened an exposition of this verse by saying \"Simeon Simeon, who is it that said: 'Let us make man?' Who is this Elohim?\" With these words the most reverend Elder vanished before anyone saw him . . . Truly now is the time to expound this mystery, because certainly there is here a mystery which hitherto it was not permitted to divulge, but now we perceive that permission is given.\" He then proceeded: \"We must picture a king who wanted several buildings to be erected, and who had an architect in his service who did nothing save with his consent. The king is the supernal wisdom above, the Central Column being the king below: Elohim is the architect above . . . and Elohim is also the architect below, being as such the Divine Presence (Shekinah) of the lower world.13\n \n Rabbi Menachem of Recanati, writing in his Commentary on the Pentateuch about the Deuteronomy 6:4 (Shema) passage, also clearly describes the mystery of the Trinity, the threefold Unity of the Godhead. Rabbi Menachem wrote about these mysteries and concluded, \"These are secrets which are revealed only to those who are reaping upon the holy field, as it is written 'The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him'\" (Psalms 25:14). Rabbi Menachem wrote the following on the Trinity:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our god is one Lord.\" This verse is the root of our faith, therefore Moses records it after the ten commandments. The reason (that there is said hwhy, Lord, Myhla, our God, and hwhy, Lord) is, because the word emv does not here signify \"Hear;\" but \"to gather together, to unite,\" as in 1 Samuel 15:4, \"Saul gathered together the people.\" The meaning implied is The Inherent-Ones are so united together, one in the other without end, they being the exalted God. He mentions the three names mystically to indicate the three exalted original Ones.15\n \n http://www.grantjeffrey.com/article/chphnwr.htm",

   "To the Christians in this forum (and anyone who wants to learn the Bible, etc.)\n \n Last year I bought an Apple iPOD (20 GB). I found, besides songs, that you can download the audio Bible on it, along with most audio (CD) books. Pluse CD's that different ministries sell or give away on sermons, etc. I have the complete NIV Bible on it now that I can listen to, and have also downloaded \"The Case for Christ,\" \"The Case for Faith,\" and other audio books which really make \"reading\" (so to speak) the Bible and listening to other songs and audio books a real pleasure. You can go to any chapter you like, and it continues on until you're done for the day. I get an hour or two in a day even at work, which doesn't interfere with my job, since a lot of people listen to their radios at work. I also got the FM transmitter for it so I can play it in my vehicle. You can set up playlists to play specific songs in a predetermined order. You can also use the FM transmitter on your home stereo. If you're also online when dowloading songs and audio books, the internet will usually (but not always) populate the song title, artist, etc. for your computer iPOD library. I'd like to recommend you do that if you have the bucks. Also, there's a software available (Tune Tools for iPOD) that allows you to upload your iPOD into a different computer if your computer crashes, so you don't have to reload each CD and book. \n \n But you need to get at least the 20 GB iPod to have room to get all your songs, the Bible, etc., on it. Just thought you might be interested.\n \n p.s. I don't work for Apple or any electronics or software firm.",

Dr. Archer graduated in 1938 with a B.A. from Harvard University (summa cum laude in Classics) and received an LL.B. from Suffolk Law School in 1939. In 1940 he received a masters degree (A.M.) and in 1944 he was awarded a doctorate (Ph.D.) at Harvard University, in Classics. Finally he received his Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.) from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1945.\n \n Dr. Archer served as a Pastor of Park Street Church in Boston from 1945 to 1948. He then became a Professor of Biblical Languages at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California from 1948 to 1965. From 1965 - 1986 he served as a Professor of Old Testament and Semitics at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Deerfield, Illinois. He became an emeritus faculty member in 1989. The remainder of his life was spent researching and writing, lecturing, and sharing his knowledge with others.\n \n In addition, Dr. Archer was one of the fifty original translators of the NASB published in 1971. He also worked on the team which translated the NIV Bible published in 1978.\n \n His defense of the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy by proposing harmonisations and exegesis regarding alleged contradictions in the Bible made Archer a well known biblical inerrantist. Dr. Archer believed \"One cannot allow for error in history-science without also ending up with error in doctrine.\"  He was critical of the documentary hypothesis which denies the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch.

   "Who Wrote the Bible? By Richard E. Friedman (a pro Documentary Hypothesis book)\n \n But the real significance of this book is that it is popularizing the \"Documentary Hypothesis,\" a theory originating in the 18th and 19th centuries which denies that Moses wrote the Pentateuch (Genesis through Deuteronomy) and which claims to find four major documents (J, E, P, and D), dating from after the reigns of David and Solomon, woven together in the Pentateuch.\n \n The author of this book is a typical product of the Liberalism of the nineteenth century, brought up on Wellhausen's Documentary Hypothesis, and carefully screened from acquaintance with any type of scholarship that disagrees with the so-called \"settled results of modern scholarship.\" Not a single conservative scholar is mentioned in the entire book, and he seems to be totally unaware that any educated thinker could disagree with the Liberal Establishment. On page 28 he declares: \"At present, however, there is hardly a biblical scholar in the world actively working on the problem who would claim that the Five Books of Moses were written by Moses - or by anyone person.\" A footnote condescendingly adds:\n \n There are many persons who claim to be biblical scholars. I refer to scholars who have the necessary training in languages, biblical archeology, and literary and historical skills to work on the problem, and who meet, discuss, and debate their ideas and research with other scholars through scholarly journals, conferences, etc. (p. 261).\n \n This seems to suggest that anyone who does not adhere to the Documentary Hypothesis is misguided and does not deserve to be regarded as a scholar at all. True scholarship is thus restricted to those who screen themselves off from all contrary evidence and dogmatically content themselves with repeating arguments long since refuted by well informed and superbly trained products of the foremost universities in America. But this kind of subjective bias hardly deserves a rating of authentic scholarship at all. A true scholar is one who is perfectly willing to listen to those who disagree with his own position, making every effort to understand them without resorting to caricature, and who then proceeds to a fair and careful analysis of the fallacies which appear in their line of reason#ing in the light of the objective evidences.\n \n The criteria of alleged contradictions and discrepancies, familiar in all of the traditional introductions written by Driver, Pfeiffer, and Eissfeldt, are run through without any notice of the refutations furnished by learned scholars of Europe and America over the last century. It is clear that he has been reading only those authors who toe the Wellhausian line with undeviating fidelity. There is never an indication that men of great learning and acumen, like Franz Delitzsch, E.W. Hengstenberg, Friedrich Keil, Joseph Addison Alexander, William Henry Green, Carl Paul Caspari, Heinrich Hahn, Rudolf Stier, Wilhelm Moeller, Robert Dick Wilson (master of forty-five languages), Edward J. Young, or Ronald K. Harrison, ever lived or wrote.\n \n \"The repeated refutation of Wellhausen's allegations of error in the Hebrew historical records furnished by archeological discoveries during the last one hundred years is scarcely noticed. He says nothing of the findings of W.F. Albright concerning the astonishing accuracy of the historical data in the Pentateuch and the Former Prophets, nor of the demolition of Wellhausen's reconstruction of Hebrew history as contained in Kenneth Kitchens Ancient Orient and the Old Testament.\" That noted Egyptologist of the University of Liverpool summarized his findings as follows:\n \n For example, in Genesis 13:10, where Lot is considering which territory to choose for his cattle to graze in, he looks with favor upon the Jordan plain, which is described as being \"like the land of Egypt as you go unto Zoar\" (a fertile district in the Delta). According to Friedman this passage was composed by \"J,\" at least five centuries after Israel had settled in Canaan. But why should the readers of Genesis have to be told what the Jordan Valley looked like after they had already been occupying it for 500 years? And why should they have to visualize it in terms of a region in Egypt? There is no other way to explain this except on the supposition that both the writer and his readers were personally acquainted with Egypt, but not with Palestine. Or again, in Genesis 33:18 the reference is made to Shalem, \"a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan.\" Why should the readers have to be told that Shechem was in the land of Canaan 500 years after it had been taken over as a capital in the tribe of Ephraim? Or again, in Numbers 13:22 the city of Hebron is said to have been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt. Obviously the readers were more familiar with the date of Zoan's founding than with Hebron's - even though Hebron had served as the capital of the tribe of Judah for several centuries before \"J\" was allegedly written in Judah itself. It is difficult to see how anyone can come to any other conclusion in the light of these evidences but that Genesis and the Pentateuch in general were composed prior to Israel's settlement in Canaan.\n \n (many more examples in the link below)\n \n In the light of these considerations, the objective evidence of the text and of all pertinent historical records bearing upon the career of Israel leads us back to the genuineness of the Mosaic date as the only plausible period for the composition of the Pentateuch. The Wellhausen hypothesis as recycled by Friedman must be perceived as an exercise in subjectivism rather than a scientific treatment of the objective data bearing upon the date of the composition of the Pentateuch. The whole concept of differing recensions of the Mosaic tradition, a J-document originating in Judah and an E-document developed in the Northern Kingdom, has in this century been called into serious question by disillusioned Wellhausians like Wilhelm Moeller, B.D. Eerdmans, Johannes Pedersen, and Ivan Engnell, all of whom completely reject the whole Documentary Hypothesis as an artificial, modern occidental type of interpretation totally unsuited and irrelevant to ancient Semitic literature. It seems to me very strange that Dr. Friedman takes absolutely no notice of these eminent scholars in Germany, Holland, and Scandanavia, as if nothing has happened since Wellhausen published his Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels in 1878.\n \n In conclusion, it might be appropriate to suggest that if Friedman had ventured to test out some of the other incredibilities of the Documentary Hypothesis, he might well have been driven to abandon it altogether. After all, as we have shown earlier, it is really impossible to defend in the light of the internal evidence of the text itself and the known facts of history. An objective and truly scientific handling of the evidence can only lead to the conclusion that Jesus Christ and the New Testament apostles were absolutely correct in assuming the genuineness of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch (cf. Matt, 19:8: Mark 12:26; John 5:46-47: 7:19: Acts 3:22).\n - Gleason L. Archer, Jr.\n \n http://www.equip.org/free/DW035.htm\n \n Welcome to the world of TRUE Biblical Scholarship, Orion.",

   "Gutting the Documentary Hypothesis\n \n What is undeniable is that the foundation of the documentary hypothesis is heavily influenced by naturalistic, humanistic philosophy. Orr reports the view of Keunen, who stated that the religion of Israel is one of many religions, and not anything more; this is, apparently, the view of \"modern theological science.\"17 In his work, Prophets and Prophecy in Israel, Keunen states: \n So soon as we derive a separate part of Israel's religious life directly from God, and allow the supernatural or immediate revelation to intervene in even one single point, so long also our view of the whole continues to be incorrect... It is the supposition of a natural development alone which accounts for all the phenomena.18 \n \n In other words, the moment one admits the intervention of special revelation or the supernatural into the study of the Israel's religious history, it is at that moment that one is guaranteed to come up with erroneous results (according to the liberal theorists). It is only by considering religious history along natural processes of development that one is, according to Keunen, guaranteed to come up with satisfactory results. \n \n Deuteronomy Source:\n \n James Orr, writing at the beginning of the twentieth century, raises some very simple yet compelling questions with regard to the liberal theory. For example, how could the priest present to the king a book purporting to be of Mosaic origin when, so to speak, the ink is still wet? Surely such a modern work would not have the look of antiquity and the king, unless he was extremely dull-witted, would not be deceived by such a clear forgery. Also, the text of 2 Kings 22 indicates an awareness of this book's existence, and the recognition of its authority when it was read. If this book were a novel invention, surely it would not have received such an eager hearing, and be recognized as the book of the law?60 \n \n Against the theory of a seventh-century origin for Deuteronomy, Harrison points out that Deuteronomy does, in fact, fit the situation of Israel on the brink of entering the Promised Land. The Israelites were about to enter a land that was under Canaanite rule, and the influence of Canaanite religion would be strong. For this reason, the Lord commanded Israel to destroy all traces of Canaanite worship, so that the pure worship of the Lord would not be tainted by pagan rituals (Deuteronomy 7, and 12, for example).63 The Deuteronomic legislation is clearly preparatory (notice the language in 18:9; 19:1; and 26:1, for example). It is surely presumption to assume that this cannot be the case; only by denying the supernatural and asserting the evolutionary view could one doubt that this legislation was given to Moses to establish the religious framework of the people once they had settled in Canaan. \n \n Critique of multiple authors:\n \n The problem that most conservatives have with the liberal approach is not that the liberal appeals to sources; it is that they appeal to hypothetical sources. 81 Numbers 21:14 refers to the Book of the Wars of the Lord; 2 Samuel 1:18 refers to the book of Jashar; 1 Kings 11:41 refers to the book of the acts of Solomon. Clearly, sources were being used in the composition of these books. Sources, however, neither deny antiquity, nor do they deny authorship. \n \n http://www.aomin.org/JEDP.html \n \n \n EVIDENCES FOR THE MOSAIC AUTHORSHIP OF THE PENTATEUCH\n \n Merely pointing out the inadequacies of the documentary hypothesis does not prove that Moses wrote the Pentateuch around 1450BC. Therefore, positive evidences for Mosaic authorship must be presented.\n \n First, the entire Pentateuch displays a unity of arrangement. Even the documentarians concede this point by inventing a hypothetical editor to explain the unity of the Pentateuch.44 This unity of arrangement strongly implies that the Pentateuch had only one author.\n \n Second, both the Old and New Testaments call Moses the author of the Pentateuch (Joshua 8:31; 1 Kings 2:3; Daniel 9:11; Mark 12:26; Luke 20:28; John 5:46-47; 7:19; Acts 3:22; Romans 10:5). Even the Pentateuch itself declares Moses to be its author (Exodus 17:14; 24:4; 34:27; Numbers 33:1-2; Deuteronomy 31:9).45\n \n Third, eyewitness details in the Pentateuch indicate the author was a participant in the events he was describing. The author at times is so precise in his details that he lists the exact number of fountains (twelve) and palm trees (seventy) in Exodus 15:27.46 The author even describes the appearance and taste of the manna from heaven for future generations (Numbers 11:7-8).47 These precise details make it unlikely that the author was other than an eyewitness of the events he recorded.\n \n Fourth, the author of the Pentateuch was well acquainted with the geography and language of Egypt. He was familiar with Egyptian names and uses Egyptian figures of speech. There is a greater percentage of Egyptian words in the Pentateuch than in the rest of the Bible. This seems to indicate that the author had lived in Egypt and was most likely educated there as well. Moses was born, raised, and educated in Egypt. It is also interesting to note that the author does not attempt to explain these uniquely Egyptian factors. This probably indicates that his original readers were also familiar with the Egyptian culture, and, this is exactly the case with the Israelites that Moses led out of Egypt.48\n \n Fifth, the author of the Pentateuch, although familiar with Egypt, shows himself to be unfamiliar with the land of Canaan.49 This is consistent with Moses. After leaving Egypt, he wandered through the wilderness of Sinai, but did not enter Canaan (the promised land). The author of the Pentateuch, though he describes with great detail the geography and vegetation of Egypt and Sinai, treats the land of Canaan as a place virtually uknown to him or his people.50 Therefore, the traditional view of Mosaic authorship is much more plausible than the documentary hypothesis.\n \n Sixth, the setting of Exodus through Numbers is that of a desert atmosphere point of view.51 Even the laws concerning sanitation apply to a desert lifestyle (Deuteronomy 23:12-13).52 This would not be the case if the author or authors lived an agricultural lifestyle in their own land for nearly a thousand years (which is what the documentary hypothesis teaches).53 Even the tabernacle (a portable tent that was the Jewish place of worship) implies a nomadic lifestyle of the worshipers.54\n \n Seventh, Moses was qualified to be the author of the Pentateuch. He was educated in Egypt, grew up there, and spent much of his later life in the Sinai desert (Acts 7:22).55\n \n Eighth, the customs recorded in the Pentateuch were genuine second millennium BC customs.56 This would not be expected if the Pentateuch was written much later. This point is even stronger when it is realized that many of these customs were not continued on into the first millennium BC. Some of these ancient customs were the legal bearing of children through maidservants, the legality of oral deathbed wills, the possessing of household idols in order to claim inheritence rights, and the way real estate transactions were practiced.57\n \n Ninth, the Ras Shamra literature dates back to approximately 1400BC.58 Therefore, writing existed during Moses' time. Hence, it cannot be argued that written languages had not developed to the degree of the Pentateuch at such an early date, which is what the documentary hypothesis teaches.\n \n Tenth, archaeological finds have confirmed much of the history and customs reported in the Pentateuch, whereas no archaeological find has refuted the history recorded in the Bible.59 Examples of this are the excavations of the cities of Bethel, Schechem, and Ur.60 Archaeology has shown that these cities were inhabited as early as 2,000BC (the time of Abraham).61 This had been denied by liberal scholars until archaeology proved them wrong and the Pentateuch right. The Hittite Legal Code, which dates back to about 1300BC, is another example. It was discovered by archaeologists between 1906 and 1912. It confirms the ancient procedure used by Abraham and several Hittites while engaging in a real estate transaction in Genesis 23.62 Another example of archaeological confirmation of the historical reliability of the Pentateuch deals with the use of camels. Genesis records that Abraham owned camels. However, since no nonbiblical references to domesticated camels had been found, liberal scholars assumed the Pentateuch had to have been written at a much later date. However, since 1950, several archaeological findings have shown that the domestication of camels in the middle east occurred as early as 2,000BC.63\n \n Eleventh, all the biblical evidence shows that the Jewish Faith was originally monotheistic, and that it later became idolatrous and polytheistic.64 This runs counter to the evolutionary view of religion. In fact, there is no historical evidence that any nation's religion ever \"evolved\" into a genuine monotheistic faith. A true monotheistic faith is unique to the Jewish religion and its offshoots (Christianity, Islam, and their offshoots).65\n \n Twelfth, liberal objections that the religious customs, writings, and legal code of the Jews were too advanced for the traditional fifteenth century BC date of composition have been shown to be unwarranted. Recent studies of ancient religions show that \"primitive\" peoples had technical sacrificial language.66 Also, the Code of Hammurabi (1800BC) is a legal code which is very similar in its sophistication to the Law of Moses.67 The census lists found in the ancient Semitic world (Mari, Ugarit, and Alalakh) between 2000 and 1500BC have much in common with the census lists found in the Book of Numbers.68 Finally, Deuteronomy follows the same basic format as the Hittite suzerainty treaties (latter half of the second millennium BC), a treaty agreed upon by a king and his people.69 Therefore, the Pentateuch appears to be a fifteenth century BC document, and not a much later writing.\n \n Thirteenth, ancient legends of creation and the worldwide flood are universal among primitive peoples. These legends appear to perversions of the true biblical account.70 An example of this would be a comparison of the ancient Babylonian flood account (the Gilgames Epic) and the Genesis flood account. Whereas the boat in the Babylonian account would never float due to its dimensions, the ark's dimensions as listed in Genesis describe a vessel that would be virtually impossible to capsize.71\n \n Fourteenth, the Jews accepted the Law as Mosaic during King Josiah's reform in 621BC. It is therefore hard to believe that a large portion of the Pentateuch had just been written. The Jews of that day could not have been so naive. It seems more likely that they had good reasons to believe the documents they had were copies of the ancient writings of Moses and not recent creations.72\n \n Fifteenth, Moses had a good reason for using different names for the one true God. He used different names for God when dealing with different contexts. He referred to God as \"Elohim\" when discussing His act of creation or His infinite power. Moses seems to have called God \"Jehovah\" (Yahweh) when speaking of God in terms of His covenant relationship with His elect.73 It is therefore unreasonable to assume that the utilization of various names for God requires more than one author. In fact, compound names such as Yahweh-Elohim are often used to refer to God. Yahweh-Elohim occurs eleven times in the second chapter of Genesis. It is ludicrous to assume that one compound name for God is the work of two authors writing at different times.74\n \n Finally, Moses also had good reasons for varying his diction and style. Good authors commonly vary their text to prevent monotony; Moses would have done the same.75 Moses would also have to vary his style due to the wide range of his subject material (genealogies, biographies, historical accounts, religious instruction, moral legislation, etc.).76 The varying of the diction and style of the Pentateuch is therefore no evidence for multiple authors. Even parallel accounts (such as the two creation accounts of Genesis 1 and 2) were common by one author in ancient Semetic literature; it was often used as a type of poetic style.77\n \n When all the above factors are taken together, the conclusion becomes obvious. There are extremely good reasons for accepting the traditional view that Moses wrote the Pentateuch between 1450 and 1410BC. There is absolutely no evidence for multiple authors of the Pentateuch (other than the case of Moses' obituary in Deuteronomy 34 which was probably penned by Joshua). The evidence points to Mosaic authorship. The liberal view is therefore based upon a bias against the supernatural; it is not based upon a scholarly consideration of the evidence.\n http://www.biblicaldefense.org/Research_Center/Apologetics/Historical_Apologetics/old_testament_reliability.htm",

Sources, however, neither deny antiquity, nor do they deny authorship. \n \n http://www.aomin.org/JEDP.html \n \n \n EVIDENCES FOR THE MOSAIC AUTHORSHIP OF THE PENTATEUCH\n \n Merely pointing out the inadequacies of the documentary hypothesis does not prove that Moses wrote the Pentateuch around 1450BC. Therefore, positive evidences for Mosaic authorship must be presented.\n \n First, the entire Pentateuch displays a unity of arrangement. Even the documentarians concede this point by inventing a hypothetical editor to explain the unity of the Pentateuch.44 This unity of arrangement strongly implies that the Pentateuch had only one author.\n \n Second, both the Old and New Testaments call Moses the author of the Pentateuch (Joshua 8:31; 1 Kings 2:3; Daniel 9:11; Mark 12:26; Luke 20:28; John 5:46-47; 7:19; Acts 3:22; Romans 10:5). Even the Pentateuch itself declares Moses to be its author (Exodus 17:14; 24:4; 34:27; Numbers 33:1-2; Deuteronomy 31:9).45\n \n Third, eyewitness details in the Pentateuch indicate the author was a participant in the events he was describing. The author at times is so precise in his details that he lists the exact number of fountains (twelve) and palm trees (seventy) in Exodus 15:27.46 The author even describes the appearance and taste of the manna from heaven for future generations (Numbers 11:7-8).47 These precise details make it unlikely that the author was other than an eyewitness of the events he recorded.\n \n Fourth, the author of the Pentateuch was well acquainted with the geography and language of Egypt. He was familiar with Egyptian names and uses Egyptian figures of speech. There is a greater percentage of Egyptian words in the Pentateuch than in the rest of the Bible. This seems to indicate that the author had lived in Egypt and was most likely educated there as well. Moses was born, raised, and educated in Egypt. It is also interesting to note that the author does not attempt to explain these uniquely Egyptian factors. This probably indicates that his original readers were also familiar with the Egyptian culture, and, this is exactly the case with the Israelites that Moses led out of Egypt.48\n \n Fifth, the author of the Pentateuch, although familiar with Egypt, shows himself to be unfamiliar with the land of Canaan.49 This is consistent with Moses. After leaving Egypt, he wandered through the wilderness of Sinai, but did not enter Canaan (the promised land). The author of the Pentateuch, though he describes with great detail the geography and vegetation of Egypt and Sinai, treats the land of Canaan as a place virtually uknown to him or his people.50 Therefore, the traditional view of Mosaic authorship is much more plausible than the documentary hypothesis.\n \n Sixth, the setting of Exodus through Numbers is that of a desert atmosphere point of view.51 Even the laws concerning sanitation apply to a desert lifestyle (Deuteronomy 23:12-13).52 This would not be the case if the author or authors lived an agricultural lifestyle in their own land for nearly a thousand years (which is what the documentary hypothesis teaches).53 Even the tabernacle (a portable tent that was the Jewish place of worship) implies a nomadic lifestyle of the worshipers.54\n \n Seventh, Moses was qualified to be the author of the Pentateuch. He was educated in Egypt, grew up there, and spent much of his later life in the Sinai desert (Acts 7:22).55\n \n Eighth, the customs recorded in the Pentateuch were genuine second millennium BC customs.56 This would not be expected if the Pentateuch was written much later. This point is even stronger when it is realized that many of these customs were not continued on into the first millennium BC. Some of these ancient customs were the legal bearing of children through maidservants, the legality of oral deathbed wills, the possessing of household idols in order to claim inheritence rights, and the way real estate transactions were practiced.57\n \n Ninth, the Ras Shamra literature dates back to approximately 1400BC.58 Therefore, writing existed during Moses' time. Hence, it cannot be argued that written languages had not developed to the degree of the Pentateuch at such an early date, which is what the documentary hypothesis teaches.\n \n Tenth, archaeological finds have confirmed much of the history and customs reported in the Pentateuch, whereas no archaeological find has refuted the history recorded in the Bible.59 Examples of this are the excavations of the cities of Bethel, Schechem, and Ur.60 Archaeology has shown that these cities were inhabited as early as 2,000BC (the time of Abraham).61 This had been denied by liberal scholars until archaeology proved them wrong and the Pentateuch right. The Hittite Legal Code, which dates back to about 1300BC, is another example. It was discovered by archaeologists between 1906 and 1912. It confirms the ancient procedure used by Abraham and several Hittites while engaging in a real estate transaction in Genesis 23.62 Another example of archaeological confirmation of the historical reliability of the Pentateuch deals with the use of camels. Genesis records that Abraham owned camels. However, since no nonbiblical references to domesticated camels had been found, liberal scholars assumed the Pentateuch had to have been written at a much later date. However, since 1950, several archaeological findings have shown that the domestication of camels in the middle east occurred as early as 2,000BC.63\n \n Eleventh, all the biblical evidence shows that the Jewish Faith was originally monotheistic, and that it later became idolatrous and polytheistic.64 This runs counter to the evolutionary view of religion. In fact, there is no historical evidence that any nation's religion ever \"evolved\" into a genuine monotheistic faith. A true monotheistic faith is unique to the Jewish religion and its offshoots (Christianity, Islam, and their offshoots).65\n \n Twelfth, liberal objections that the religious customs, writings, and legal code of the Jews were too advanced for the traditional fifteenth century BC date of composition have been shown to be unwarranted. Recent studies of ancient religions show that \"primitive\" peoples had technical sacrificial language.66 Also, the Code of Hammurabi (1800BC) is a legal code which is very similar in its sophistication to the Law of Moses.67 The census lists found in the ancient Semitic world (Mari, Ugarit, and Alalakh) between 2000 and 1500BC have much in common with the census lists found in the Book of Numbers.68 Finally, Deuteronomy follows the same basic format as the Hittite suzerainty treaties (latter half of the second millennium BC), a treaty agreed upon by a king and his people.69 Therefore, the Pentateuch appears to be a fifteenth century BC document, and not a much later writing.\n \n Thirteenth, ancient legends of creation and the worldwide flood are universal among primitive peoples. These legends appear to perversions of the true biblical account.70 An example of this would be a comparison of the ancient Babylonian flood account (the Gilgames Epic) and the Genesis flood account. Whereas the boat in the Babylonian account would never float due to its dimensions, the ark's dimensions as listed in Genesis describe a vessel that would be virtually impossible to capsize.71\n \n Fourteenth, the Jews accepted the Law as Mosaic during King Josiah's reform in 621BC. It is therefore hard to believe that a large portion of the Pentateuch had just been written. The Jews of that day could not have been so naive. It seems more likely that they had good reasons to believe the documents they had were copies of the ancient writings of Moses and not recent creations.72\n \n Fifteenth, Moses had a good reason for using different names for the one true God. He used different names for God when dealing with different contexts. He referred to God as \"Elohim\" when discussing His act of creation or His infinite power. Moses seems to have called God \"Jehovah\" (Yahweh) when speaking of God in terms of His covenant relationship with His elect.73 It is therefore unreasonable to assume that the utilization of various names for God requires more than one author. In fact, compound names such as Yahweh-Elohim are often used to refer to God. Yahweh-Elohim occurs eleven times in the second chapter of Genesis. It is ludicrous to assume that one compound name for God is the work of two authors writing at different times.74\n \n Finally, Moses also had good reasons for varying his diction and style. Good authors commonly vary their text to prevent monotony; Moses would have done the same.75 Moses would also have to vary his style due to the wide range of his subject material (genealogies, biographies, historical accounts, religious instruction, moral legislation, etc.).76 The varying of the diction and style of the Pentateuch is therefore no evidence for multiple authors. Even parallel accounts (such as the two creation accounts of Genesis 1 and 2) were common by one author in ancient Semetic literature; it was often used as a type of poetic style.77\n \n When all the above factors are taken together, the conclusion becomes obvious. There are extremely good reasons for accepting the traditional view that Moses wrote the Pentateuch between 1450 and 1410BC. There is absolutely no evidence for multiple authors of the Pentateuch (other than the case of Moses' obituary in Deuteronomy 34 which was probably penned by Joshua). The evidence points to Mosaic authorship. The liberal view is therefore based upon a bias against the supernatural; it is not based upon a scholarly consideration of the evidence.\n http://www.biblicaldefense.org/Research_Center/Apologetics/Historical_Apologetics/old_testament_reliability.htm\n\n \n \n None of which addresses what the documentary hypthoses says.\n \n And not one of those bothers to do an analysis of the the hebrew, or show why that methodology is incorrect. The amazing thing, those same people nod sagely when that same method of analysis concluded that Acts was written by the same person who wrote luke.",

   "And I've already refuted them. Or if I haven't, please demonstrate by counter-argument how my refutations were inadequate.\n\n \n You haven't refuted this from my prior link by any means: \n \n The Pentateuch itself shows how Moses was to write these commands, laws and even journeys of the Israelites. Moses was told in Exodus 17:14, \"Write this in a book as a memorial, and recite it to Joshua.\" Exodus 24:4 says that \"Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord.\" In Exodus 34:27 Moses was told to \"write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.\" With reference to the wilderness wanderings, Numbers 33:1-2 says that Moses \"recorded their starting places according to their journeys by the command of the Lord...\" Deuteronomy 31:9 says that Moses wrote \"this law and gave it to the priests.\" Verse 22 says that he wrote down a song and gave it to the children of Israel. That song is the bulk of chapter 32. Given this kind of evidence, it is certainly within reason to assume Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. Moses was capable of such writing, he was told to write, and the Scriptures show him doing just that.\n \n The rest of the Old Testament shows more of the same kind of testimony concerning Moses. The book of Joshua is filled with references to Moses, as Joshua acted \"as the Lord commanded Moses\" (cf., Joshua 11:15, 20; 14:2; 21:2, etc.). After Moses died, the Israelites, under the leadership of Joshua, were told to \"do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you\" (1:7). Then, verse 8 says, \"this book of the law shall not depart from your mouth.\" This shows that Moses issued a \"book of the law\" that they were to carefully follow. When Joshua built an altar, he did it \"just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses\" (8:31). \"Then afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel\" (vv. 34-35a). These verses make it clear that the law they were reading was written by Moses. Other Old Testament passages verify this also, but these should be sufficient to make the point (e.g., 1 Kings 2:3; 2 Kings 14:6; 21:8; Ezra 6:18; Neh. 13:1, etc.). The Old Testament clearly regards Moses as the author of the books of the Law (i.e., the Pentateuch).\n \n \n \nThey (Trebor, Orion)do not present sources from antiquity because the prevailing opinion in antiquity is precisely what their hypothesis challenges. Their 'sources' are in the text of the Pentateuch itself. Why don't you address that?\n\n \n Let's see, their sources are in the same works which clarify that Moses was told in Exodus 17:14, \"Write this in a book as a memorial, and recite it to Joshua.\" And Exodus 24:4 which says that \"Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord.\" In Exodus 34:27 Moses was told to \"write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.\" With reference to the wilderness wanderings, Numbers 33:1-2 says that Moses \"recorded their starting places according to their journeys by the command of the Lord...\" Deuteronomy 31:9 says that Moses wrote \"this law and gave it to the priests.\" Verse 22 says that he wrote down a song and gave it to the children of Israel. That song is the bulk of chapter 32. Given this kind of evidence, it is certainly within reason to assume Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. Moses was capable of such writing, he was told to write, and the Scriptures show him doing just that.\n \n And they also wantonly reject The rest of the Old Testament which shows more of the same kind of testimony concerning Moses. The book of Joshua is filled with references to Moses, as Joshua acted \"as the Lord commanded Moses\" (cf., Joshua 11:15, 20; 14:2; 21:2, etc.).

   "DamEtel: What about people who believe in something so much they are willing to suffer - even die - for it? I thought you Christians were really into that kind of thing!\n \n I ask because the history of the Documentary Hypothesis is filled with those who were persecuted for daring to suggest that evidence led away from the tradition that Moses had written the entire Pentateuch. Another case of the church strangling free thought! \n \n\n \n \nBradamante:\n a) What is 'the church'?\n b) Who was peresecuted by 'the church' for this?\n \n\n \n First I must correct an error I made. When I wrote the above I was going off memory from what I had read 2 weeks ago and thought I remembered at least one person who had been killed - burned at the stake. But I was mixing up two different things. One of the facts is that some of these open-minded authors' books got burned, and the second is that an attempt was made on one of the open-minded author's life. \n \n Now, here are some of the church's actions to strangle free thought and advancement of understanding and knowledge (emphasis added).\n \n \nIn a second stage of the process, investigators suggested that Moses wrote the Five Books but that editors went over them later, adding an occasional word of phrase of their own. In the sixteenth century, Andreas van Maes, who was a Flemish Catholic, and two Jesuit scholars, Benedict Pereira and Jacques Bonfrere, thus pictured an original text from the hand of Moses upon which later writers expanded. Van Maes suggested that a later editor inserted phrases or changed the name of a place to its more current name so that readers would understand it better. Van Maes' book was placed on the Catholic Index of Prohibited Books.\n \n Four years later, Isaac de la Peyrere, a French Calvinist, also wrote explicitly that Moses was not the author of the first books of the Bible. He, too, noted problems running through the text ... De La Peyrere's book was banned and burned. He was arrested and informed that in order to be released he would have to become Catholic and recant his views to the Pope. He did.\n \n About the same time, in Holland, the philosopher Spinoza published a unified critical analysis, likewise demonstrating that the problematic passages were not a few isolated cases that could be explained away one by one. ... Spinoza had been excommunicated from Judaism. Now his work was condemned by Catholics and Protestants as well. His book was placed on the Catholic Index [of Prohibited Books], within six years thirty-seven edicts were issued against it, and an attempt was made on his life.\n \n A short time later, in France, Richard Simon, a convert from Protestantism who had become a Catholic priest, wrote a work that he intended to be critical of Spinoza. ... His contemporaries, however, apparently were not ready for a work that said that any part of the Five Books was not Mosaic. Simon was attacked by other Catholic clergy and expelled from his order. His books were places on the [Catholic] Index [of Prohibited Books].  ... An English version of the book came out, translated by John Hampden, but Hampden later recanted. The understated report by the scholar Edward Gray in his account of the events tells it best: Hampden \"repudiated the opinions he had held in common with Simon ... in 1688, probably shortly before his release from the tower.\"\n \n (Who Wrote the Bible?, Richard Elliott Friedman, Harper Collins, 1987, p19-21)\n \n \n \n Hopefully, that is enough to answer your above two questions.",

   "Originally Posted by DamEtel\n Have you read the book \"Who Wrote the Bible\"? It will give you a good look at the evidences behind the Documentary Hypothesis.\n \n \nNo. But I am already well aware of epistemological methods concerning those that seek to undermine accepted teachings...\n\n \n \"...those that seek to undermine accepted teachings\"? Are you suggesting the existence of some sort of conspiracy? Whatever. The evidence which led people as far back as the 17th century to question Moses' authorship of the Torah (or that of any single author for that matter) was solidified by the Documentary Hypothesis, which remains in force to this day. The DH is accepted by all but the most conservative of biblical scholars, which is pretty much to be expected. \n \n I recommended Friedman's Who Wrote The Bible because it is probably the best source on the subject for the interested layperson. The fact that Reform and Conservative Jewish Bible commentaries pretty much accept the DH is quite telling. For example...\n \n Doubts that the Torah was a book set down by one author, Moses, developed some centuries ago...The early critics noted the differential use of the names of God in various parts of the Torah, the discrepancies of certain accounts and figures, and different literary styles. Later scholars further analyzed the text so that they could discern many authors and editors...\n \n The theory which continues to command general scholarly adherence is called the Documentary Hypothesis ...In substance it says that there are four major sources or documents (called J, E, P, and D), the combination of which during the fifth century BCE resulted in the creation of a single book, the Torah, which was declared a sacred text by official canonization about the year 400.\n \n In general, our commentary favors the position just outlined, namely, that the Torah as we now know it is essentially the repository of centuries of traditions which became one tradition and one book.  - The Torah - A Modern Commentary, Edited by W. Gunther Plaut, Union of American Hebrew Congregations Pub.\n \n And...\n \n The anonymous authors of the Torah's legislation were certain that the laws they proposed were not of their invention but were derivable from Mosaic principles. - Etz Hayim - Torah and Commentary, The Rabbinical Assembly of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, JPS Pub.\n \n Note the use of the word \"anonymous\".",
