And who's going to pay for a wallet-clearing Hillary-care and universal health care program? Just look at the socialist health care fiasco in Canada, where people have to wait eons for operations, etc. As for budget decifits, Democrats normally try to resolve that by AGAIN raising taxes, instead of leaning down growth in program spending. We saw 40+ years of that mess under Democrat control of Congress.

If they had their way Saddam and his murdering thugs would not only still be in power in Iraq, but they'd still be in Kuwait.

   "Once again you are not gay so you have no prospective on this issue. You are viewing this though the lens of heterosexual privilege. I am being denied something based solely on the sex of the particpants. If that is not a violation of my civil rights then what is it?\n\n \n I know this is an old thread but I thought Matthew would like this which was written by a high school student: \n \n I have heterosexual privilege if....\n \n 1. I can, if I wish, legally marry my life partner.\n \n 2. I can, if I wish, have public recognition and support for my intimate relationship.\n \n 3. I have and can receive cards or phone calls celebrating my commitment to another person.\n \n 4. I can, if I wish, kiss my partner and show affection on the street without being conscious of what others may think or do to us.\n \n 5. I can, if I wish, easily talk about my relationship with anyone.\n \n 6. I don't have others or myself question my normalcy.\n \n 7. I can, if I wish, show pain and get support when a relationship ends.\n \n 8. I can, if I wish, have children without any questions.\n \n 9. I can, if I wish, be open, without hesitation, about apartment or house hunting with my significant other.\n \n 10. I can, if I wish, choose not to do something if it means others may think it makes me gay or lesbian.\n \n 11. I am validated by my religion.\n \n 12. I am socially accepted by my neighbors without question.\n \n 13. I have accepted paid leave from my employment when my partner was sick or in need of my assistance.\n \n 14. I am comfortable and accepted in my children's school, with my children's teachers and school activities.\n \n 15. I can, if I wish, dress however I want without worrying about what it represents.\n \n 16. I can, if I wish, have in-laws.\n \n 17. Under probate law, I can, if I wish, inherit from my partner/lover/companion.\n \n 18. I can share health, auto and homeowner's insurance policies at reduced rates.\n \n 19. I can, if I wish, be employed as a teacher in a pre-school through high school without fear of being fired any day because I am assumed to corrupt children.\n \n 20. I can, if I wish, raise children without threats of state intervention, without children having to be worried which of their friends might reject them because of their parent's sexuality and culture.\n \n 21. I can and have dated the person I desired in my teenage years.\n \n 22. I don't have to lie about my social activities.\n \n 23. I can, if I wish, work without being identified by my sexuality and culture (e.g., I get to be the farmer, the artist, the professor without being labeled the heterosexual farmer, the heterosexual artist, etc.).\n \n 24. My sexual orientation is represented in the media and I don't feel excluded.\n \n 25. I can, if I wish, share holidays with my lover and families without question or rejection.\n \n 26. I don't have to explain or justify my sexual orientation.\n \n 27. I don't have to be nervous about talking to my family and friends about my sexual orientation.\n \n 28. I don't feel compelled to disprove myths of my own heterosexuality.\n \n 29. I don't have to fear that my sexuality may become a major point in a smear campaign that may affect the custody of my child, the job I want, the house I want to buy, the way I am treated by my neighbors and family.\n \n 30. I automatically have custody of my own children if my partner dies.\n \n 31. I can, if I wish, easily visit my partner/spouse in the case of hospitalization without lying or without question.\n \n 32. I am accepted by society as a heterosexual person, not just tolerated.",
