   "\"\n Responding to a constitutional challenge to the law prohibiting gay and lesbian troops from serving openly in the military in the case Log Cabin Republicans v. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Assistant Attorney General Tony West cited previous court findings that Congress \"could have rationally found the DADT policy to be necessary to 'further military effectiveness by maintaining unit cohesion, accommodating personal privacy and reducing sexual tension.'\" ..... \n \n .... Said Schmaler in a statement: &#8220;In this case the Department is defending the statute, as it traditionally does when acts of Congress are challenged. The Department does not pick and choose which federal laws it will defend based on any one Administration&#8217;s policy preferences.&#8221;\n \n That explanation did not cut the mustard with many gay rights advocates, including Richard Socarides, a former White House adviser for President Bill Clinton, who asked, \"What is (Attorney General) Eric Holder thinking? Is the Department of Justice on auto piliot? The president campaigns against 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' and says it's unconstitutional. Gates and (Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike) Mullen say it lacks integrity. What is he thinking when he uses homophobic language - 18 years old - from Colin Powell - who himself is now against it. Inexplicable.\"\"More at Using Outdated Quotes from Colin Powell, Obama Justice Department Files Brief to Support Don't Ask/Don't Tell Policy - Political Punch\n \n Yeah, that Obama is so pro-gay, isn't he? emoticon_rolleyes",
