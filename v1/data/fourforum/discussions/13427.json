Churchill might have stopped the torture of German POWs, but he had no problem ordering the firebombing of huge civilian populations in Germany, killing hundreds of thousanmds of civilians in the process.\n \n \n\n Winston Churchill wrote regarding the Dresden firebombings that killed 125k civilians:\n I ... assume that the view under consideration is something like this: no doubt in the past we were justified in attacking German cities. But to do so was always repugnant and now that the Germans are beaten anyway we can properly abstain from proceeding with these attacks. This is a doctrine to which I could never subscribe. Attacks on cities like any other act of war are intolerable unless they are strategically justified. But they are strategically justified in so far as they tend to shorten the war and preserve the lives of Allied soldiers. To my mind we have absolutely no right to give them up unless it is certain that they will not have this effect. I do not personally regard the whole of the remaining cities of Germany as worth the bones of one British Grenadier. The feeling, such as there is, over Dresden, could be easily explained by any psychiatrist. It is connected with German bands and Dresden shepherdesses. Actually Dresden was a mass of munitions works, an intact government centre, and a key transportation point to the East. It is now none of these things \n\n \n This was only one of many German cities firebombed, many after Germany was in its death throes.",

Churchill punished the German people, all of the German people, near the end of the war, for the \"V-1 and V-2\" bombings of civilian areas in England.

They supported the holocaust and the madman responsible for it and that was enough guilt for me to be OK with the bombings.\n As for Japan, my father was part of the Pacific fleet at the end of the war.

   "What I see is boring exaggeration to avoid the point...\n \n I asked a simple question and you run off into hyperbole land instead of a simple answer.\n \n So by your position, if I were to take that article's comments and replace them with regards to Martin Luther King Jr and civil rights (and a Republican speaker), you would have a problem with it?\n \n If I were to quote McCain's comments praising MLK, you would condemn him for them?\n\n \n Did McCain, who I'm not a real fan of, BTW, praise MLK for his morality or his work for civil rights?\n \n\n My whole point is that this thread is pathetic. \n The article talks about Obama PRAISING Churchill.\n So my question involved the use of the word \"praise\", which you chose to elevate with sarcasm to \"messiah\".\n But at the same time, you obviously are ignoring the point of the question...\n \n My point is simple. People don't operate in normal life the way that people who want to attack Obama operate.\n Just another thread for criticizing Obama for made-up standards...\n\n \n My problem is I distrust people that use history selectively to suit their current needs. Obama read somewhere that Churchill wouldn't allow prisoners to be tortured, so he jumped on that tidbit to reinforce his position. Using Churchill's decision for his own aggrandizement doesn't work with a student of history.",

   "Did Obama praise Churchill for \"his morality\" or for not torturing Germans during WW II?\n\n \n \n\n Obama, with Churchill's help, rejected Cheney's argument. He told the assembled journalists: \"I was struck by an article that I was reading the other day talking about the fact that the British, during World War Two, when London was being bombed to smithereens, had 200 or so detainees. And Churchill said 'we don't torture', when all of the British people were being subjected to unimaginable risk and threat. \n \n \"And the reason was that Churchill understood you start taking shortcuts, and over time, that corrodes what's best in a people. It corrodes the character of a country.\" \n Barack Obama and Churchill friends again after 100 days | People in the News | People | The First Post \n\n \n Now, what does that last paragraph mean to you?\n \n\n You claim to wear a lot of hats, don't ya... \n \n Like I keep pointing out, appreciating ONE ASPECT of what a person did IS NOT the same thing as giving unequivocable praise to everything the guy ever did...\n\n \n I do wear a lot of hats and history is one of my hobbies.\n \n He did more that that. He equated Churchill's decision with maintaining the moral character of the UK. The UK engaged in all sorts of vengeance against Germany during and after WWII that would question their moral character during that period of time.",
