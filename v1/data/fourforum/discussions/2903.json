   "When the GB gave the refuge to Berezovsky and Zakaev last year Blair was really proud of it. To be sure London demonstrated humanism and democratic values when they saved from undeserved persecution the oligarch and the main Chechen freedom fighter. But today when Islam terrorists openly begin to show their power in Europe (I mean Madrid and Prague explosions), when European countries special services began to hunt after Islam fundamentalists leaders (first of all after al Zarkavi) Zakaev concealment looks like treason of Gr. Britain on the side of the prime minister to put it mildly. To the point Zakaev personally knows Zarkavi. He met him several times in Chechnya and continues to communicate with Bin Laden's right hand. Berezovsky also panders terrorism financially. If Blear worrys about his political future he would rather revise his position of humble and aggrieved defender of Zakaev and Berezovsky.",
