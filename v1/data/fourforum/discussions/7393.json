   "Lenin Dies Of Cerebral Hemorrhage; Moscow Throngs Overcome With Grief; Trotsky Departs Ill, Radek In Disfavor\n Soviet Congress In Tears  \n Mass Hysteria Only Aborted by a Leader's Brusque Intervention \n BODY WILL LIE IN STATE \n Is to be Taken to Moscow Today From Village Where Premier Passed Away. \n KREMLIN WALL HIS TOMB \n Washington Expects no Immediate Change in the Policy of the Russian Government. \n By Walter Duranty \n By Wireless to The New York Times \n Moscow, Jan. 22, 1924 -- Nikolai Lenin died last night at 6:50 o'clock. The immediate cause of death was paralysis of the respiratory centers due to a cerebral hemorrhage.\n \n For some time optimistic reports had been current as the effects of a previous lesion gradually cleared up, but Lenin's nearest friends, realizing the progress of the relentless malady, tried vainly to hope against hope.\n \n At 11:20 o'clock this morning President Kalinin briefly opened the session of the All-Russian Soviet Congress and requested every one to stand. He had not slept all night and tears were streaming down his haggard face. A sudden wave of emotion- not a sound but a strange stir- passed over the audience, none of whom knew what had happened. The music started to play the Soviet funeral march, but was instantly hushed as Kalinin murmured brokenly:\n \n \"I bring you terrible news about our dear comrade, Vladimir Ilyitch.\" [Nikolai Lenin was his pen name.]\n \n High up in the gallery a woman uttered a low, wailing cry that was followed by a burst of sobs.\n \n Kalinin Breaks the News. \n \n \"Yesterday,\" faltered Kalinin, \"yesterday, he suffered a further stroke of paralysis and ---\" There was a long pause as if the speaker were unable to nerve himself to pronounce the fatal word; then, with an effort which shook his whole body, it came-- \"died.\"\nNow here is something that will have JP Sartre, Diogenes, etc., and those folks weeping into their beer:\n \n \nIt is better to execute a hundred innocent people than to permit one guilty person to go free -- Vladimir Ilich Lenin\nBut the cronies of JP Sartre, Diogenes, etc., and those folks were the cronies of Lenin as well:\n \n \nWe must execute not only the guilty. Execution of the innocent will impress the masses -- Nikolai Kylenko, Commissioner of Justice under Lenin\nBut for us thinking folk who don't march in lockstep with the Commisar here's Blackstone:\n \nIt is better that ten guilty persons escape than one innocent person suffer -- Sir William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\n",
