   "So, has anyone else heard about this?\n \n I'm in College, or going to college, right now, so I'm a bit surprised that they're just discovering this.\n \n In many Southern States, Corporal Punishment is being allowed, and no one is doing anything about it. Just the other day, my Aunt sent my 12 year old cousin's principle a note saying that he had every right to use a paddle if she misbehaved. \n \n And the paddle has been used.\n \n This, of course, is not the only case of Corporal Punishment that I have seen, but, it is the one that hits home the most for me, because, it involves family, as you understand.\n \n I, for one, find this slightly disturbing. Why would you allow someone else, that is not family, to hit you child? Why would you hit someone else's child?\n \n And, the true question becomes this:\n \n What are we gaining? Honestly? \n \n The answer is this:\n \n We're gaining children who hate the world because of what they had to go through in school. We're gaining more gang members, and Mob supporters. \n \n Because, trust me, the only way anyone is going to believe that they are being hit for their own good is if it comes from their Mama, or Daddy. I used to get XXXXXX when the teacher pushed me when I was younger. How was I going to react to getting hit? I would have gotten mad at the teachers, and my Mother, for her allowing it to happen, and for them doing it.\n \n \n \n I honestly think that we should change tons of things in this area, as this is just not right. I'm all for discipline, but, I also maintain the belief that you keep your hands on your own children. Therefor, I believe that we should just stick to calling the parents and letting them straighten it out. Trying to beat the children into submission helps nothing and no one. Especially when you really have a problem child, that already hates the world.\n \n But, what do you think?",

To me unless something causes serious injury with long lasting complications that requires surgery, treatment or therapy to correct, then I don't consider it harm.\n \n What's the worst that a spanking can do to a child in terms of physical injury? A bruise where they put their weight most of the time? That hardly warrants the classification as harm. Hell when our parents and grandparents were kids, even when we were kids, injuries at the playground were common. Scrapes, bruises, black eyes, bloody noses, etc. And those were considerably more severe than the kind of bruising one would receive from a properly administered paddling.\n \n \nif you think spanking is an appropriate form of discipline, more severe punishment is needed for more severe actions. if you cause moderate physical harm to your kid for simple things, would you cause more pain for worse stuff?\n\n \n I don't believe in causing serious physical injury to others, the scum of society notwithstanding. If your child has reached the point where they're causing serious criminal offenses for the fun of it, they've blown past the point where you can correct them and make them behave. It's now a matter for the police and the courts to handle.\n \n \nif a kid learns about ethics and why certain actions are wrong, i urge you to provide a logical explanation for why that kid would be motivated to do bad things that he knows are bad.\n\n \n Sociopathy, peer pressure, boredom, disregard for morals, drugs, acting out and rebelling, etc.\n \n \nlearning about the moral code will help the kid develop his own moral code, and he wont bully other kids because its morally wrong to him. its incredibly simple, and i think parents spend enough time helping their kids develop personal moral codes.\n\n \n Pure oversimplification.

They need to understand the concept of punishment and undesired consequences if you're going to have any hope of them learning anything. If they don't want to avoid the punishment, what motivation do they have to do the right thing?\n \n \nyou havent answered my question. if your kid was caught by teachers kicking and slapping schoolmates on the butt, would you then punish him by spanking him? the double-standard in this is that youre punishing your kid by doing the very thing youre punishing him for. your kid spanks another kid, and gets spanked as a punishment to teach him not to spank other kids.\n\n \n Well first off you never said anything about teachers doing the catching.\n \n Second, what about mitigating circumstances? Was this a game being played, like how our parents used to imitate the Three Stooges for laughs? Is it a practical joke amongst friends? Or was it a serious matter that needed definite intervention? These are things that have to be taken into consideration, because it could mean the difference between a lecture about inappropriate behavior when at school, and the need for serious correction.\n \n And I still fail to see how what you speak of qualifies as a double standard, or perpetuating a cycle. For that to happen my hypothetical child would have to feel that the other child they were giving the beating to needed to be punished for something they did.

As far as I recall I never tried to hurt my sister again.\n When I was in my late teens I manhandled my mother a little ..I kind of pushed her out of my way.\n She told my Dad.\n He told me that if I ever pushed my mother again I would have to face him for it.\n I suddenly realised my position in the pecking order and felt deeply embarassed.....that has served me well.\n I have suffered no trauma and learned a great lesson.\n I maintain that some people need this lesson.\n Notice there was no ' beatings' , my discomfort was swift.\n Also once it was over , it was over.\n \n A child that likes to kick other children butts may find a small spell of their own butt being beaten a lesson of how it feels to be bullied.\n This may or may not make them more empathic with their victims..probably more than only telling them that what they are doing is wrong...actions speak louder than words.\n If it does not then it may still be a deterrent.\n\n \n yes, i acknowledge that physical punishment can deliver success, but IMO, a child will learn why something is bad far better with the alternative discipline methods. would you agree than when your dad bit you, you learned not to bite your sister? you didnt learn that hurting people is wrong and you should rather be caring for other people's well being?\n \n yea, fair enough, you stopped biting your sister but that doesnt really help build your moral foundation. if anything, effectively using something other than physical punishment will not only stop a child from doing that specific thing, but maybe it will help them stop doing related things, like hurting anyone as opposed to just biting them. also, using another method may help a child build his own morality.\n \n think about it, if you had been taught why hurting people was bad, and you should look out for their well being instead, would you have still shoved your mom as a teen? i find it highly unlikely - at that point, respecting your family would be amongst your moral interests.\n \n and my question about the kid spanking other kids was about the hypocricy of it all.",

(as bennedict said their role models are using physical pain to coerce others, nothing could be clearer)\n \n You point to the historical use of physical pain, I counter with historical lack.\n \n Since your examples are a combination of physical pain and moral teaching and mine are of moral teaching alone; the common element which seems to be producing moral behavior is moral teaching, not physical pain.\n \n In human interactions it is not hypocritical to respond to violence with violence, but that is known as a state of war.\n \n By responding to the child's violence (and if you really want to screw up non-violent but otherwise unacceptable) behavior with violence will force one of two behavior patterns.\n \n War or slavery.\n \n War will result if the child does not believe he deserves this pain, in other words he does not believe he was wrong.\n \n Slavery will result of the child submits, there are two reason the child will submit\n 1. He believes he was wrong.\n 2. He still believes he was right but is unwilling to endure the pain again.\n \n If war is the option the child chooses, you will accomplish nothing; this will cause only hatred and the often observed acts of defiance which the child performs to express their independence from this force.\n \n Parents who believe in pain infliction will take this merely to mean they have to keep trying more physical pain. They will continue until the slavery alternative is realized.\n \n By the way these terms are not out of the blue, when breaking a horse or a man even if they weren't 'miss behaving' pain and hardship were dealt until the slavery mindset was accomplished.\n \n Once at the slavery stage 1. or 2. will stabilize the child, as I said before if 1. is the stabilization they have the proper moral attitude which means the punishment was extraneous.\n \n 2. is the dangerous one, 2. is the one that produces criminals and violent children.\n \n It creates a host of permanent and dangerous emotions and habits: shame for lacking the courage to keep fighting, Anger for being suppressed, Dishonesty as a habit of lying about what they think.\n \n Most dangerous is the dishonesty, it will in the worst cases teach the child that honest human reactions are necessarily painful, it will cause them to try to manipulate others because the fear telling the truth.\n \n What you are hoping for when you continue to inflict pain upon a child is that they will submit and choose 1.\n \n What bennedict and me are saying is that this is completly round about since 1. necessitates moral learning the entire previous process couldn't avoid it but simply forced the child to do the logic on their own and ran the risk of 2.\n \n What bennedict is also saying is that you can use other negatives to motivate a child to learn without running the risks of 2.\n \n \nWhat's one of the problems with such a position? There's no motivation for the child to learn, regardless of the fact that their parents are trying to teach them highly complex and opinionated thoughts that they simply don't have the mental facilities to comprehend. You might as well be explaining astrophysics to them.\n\n Pains the only thing they understand huh?\n \n Then you aren't saying that it is some kind of proper way to raise a child but merely a necessary inconvenience due to the developmental speed of the human brain?\n \n \nOf course another flaw with Freedom's thinking is that any amount of pain caused to one by another, for any reason, under any circumstances, is harmful in the most dire ways and will cause the one harmed to become harmful and dangerous to others, no exceptions.\n\n I am treating the concepts as they are.\n \n Pain is bad, it will always be bad no matter who is experiencing it.\n \n Sometimes things are necessary and so the sum is not bad, pain + exercise is good but only because exercise is good, if you could exercise without pain it would be better.\n \n What I am criticizing is the idea that pain is somehow advancing the child or helping them in an intrinsic way 'making them harder'.\n \n \nIn short, the classic liberal mindset.\n\n I am a classical liberal :P",

You don't get to have it both ways.\n\n \n epic facepalm...\n \n first of all, moral standards are not complicated. everyone has them, kids included, they just need help developing and modifying them to be acceptable. for example, spanking your kid with no explanation, he might understand this as acceptable behavior and mirror it to schoolmates. thats a moral standard to him, but its not acceptable. parents can help modify that moral standard by teaching your kid that that kind of behavior is not acceptable - and that means no spanking. facepalmingly simple.\n \n by \"teaching them astrophysics\" i mean very basic stuff. mass = gravity, thats how planets and stars are formed, basic orbital stuff etc. if youre patient and a good teacher, im sure plenty of kids would learn a thing or two about a complicated subject.\n \n and... i cant believe im repeating this. spanking kids WILL GIVE RESULTS. they know why theyre receiving physical punishment, and the specific actions will stop as a result. i never said they assume theyre being beaten for no reason, (read very carefully) i said physical punishment is UNNECESSARY.\n \n will they become violent and mad later on? possibly. they may learn that being physical is the way to deal with anger, and an acceptable way of dealing with someone who has done something they dont like. again, learning by repeating.\n \n speaking of learning by repeating, im finding it frustrating trying to have a discussion when i continuously have to repeat my position over and over again. ive said everything i said in this post before, multiple times, and your confusion could be cleared up by simply reposting some of my previous posts. why are my arguments so hard to grasp in this thread? my evolution arguments are easy to grasp, religion arguments, homosexuality arguments, but for some reason, my opinion on spanking has flown over both you and gansao's heads repeatedly. im very impatient when arguing to begin with, and you arent helping. so, ill compile my argument into a list, so you dont forget, or maybe you can actually understand my argument for the first time.\n \n 1: kids will learn not to do a certain action from being spanked\n 2: kids will not learn why something is bad from being spanked (they wont learn about moral standards, because youre not teaching them)\n 3: spanking is an unnecessary form of punishment\n 4: kids learn exceedingly quickly; they can learn about morality very quickly\n 5: because of 4, other methods are more effective at teaching kids morality compared to spanking\n 6: kids learn about actions the fastest by immitating\n 7: because of 6, they may pick up and use the same actions their parents are doing to them\n \n instead of endlessly repeating points, from now on if i have to, ill simply copy/paste these points.",

   "epic facepalm...\n \n first of all, moral standards are not complicated. everyone has them, kids included, they just need help developing and modifying them to be acceptable. for example, spanking your kid with no explanation, he might understand this as acceptable behavior and mirror it to schoolmates. thats a moral standard to him, but its not acceptable. parents can help modify that moral standard by teaching your kid that that kind of behavior is not acceptable - and that means no spanking. facepalmingly simple.\n \n by \"teaching them astrophysics\" i mean very basic stuff. mass = gravity, thats how planets and stars are formed, basic orbital stuff etc. if youre patient and a good teacher, im sure plenty of kids would learn a thing or two about a complicated subject.\n \n and... i cant believe im repeating this. spanking kids WILL GIVE RESULTS. they know why theyre receiving physical punishment, and the specific actions will stop as a result. i never said they assume theyre being beaten for no reason, (read very carefully) i said physical punishment is UNNECESSARY.\n \n will they become violent and mad later on? possibly. they may learn that being physical is the way to deal with anger, and an acceptable way of dealing with someone who has done something they dont like. again, learning by repeating.\n \n speaking of learning by repeating, im finding it frustrating trying to have a discussion when i continuously have to repeat my position over and over again. ive said everything i said in this post before, multiple times, and your confusion could be cleared up by simply reposting some of my previous posts. why are my arguments so hard to grasp in this thread? my evolution arguments are easy to grasp, religion arguments, homosexuality arguments, but for some reason, my opinion on spanking has flown over both you and gansao's heads repeatedly. im very impatient when arguing to begin with, and you arent helping. so, ill compile my argument into a list, so you dont forget, or maybe you can actually understand my argument for the first time.\n \n 1: kids will learn not to do a certain action from being spanked\n 2: kids will not learn why something is bad from being spanked (they wont learn about moral standards, because youre not teaching them)\n 3: spanking is an unnecessary form of punishment\n 4: kids learn exceedingly quickly; they can learn about morality very quickly\n 5: because of 4, other methods are more effective at teaching kids morality compared to spanking\n 6: kids learn about actions the fastest by immitating\n 7: because of 6, they may pick up and use the same actions their parents are doing to them\n \n instead of endlessly repeating points, from now on if i have to, ill simply copy/paste these points.\n\n \n The world according to Bennedict part 1\n Children who are unruly have not been taken to one side by their parents and quitely told the morals behind good behaviour.\n \n Children having a full on tantrum can be completely placated by telling them it is wrong to have tantrums.\n \n If your child is s particularly nasty little brute and tends to bully other children then tell them that it is wrong to hurt other children and they will instantly stop doing it.\n If other children hit your child, tell your child to teach them the very thing you told them and pass on the word.\n The playground will soon be full of quiet loving children.\n \n Next time Bennedict will tell us how telling Iran to play fair will stop their nuclear weapon programme...it looks like its working for N Korea already.",

Answer that one already.\n \n \nparents can help modify that moral standard by teaching your kid that that kind of behavior is not acceptable - and that means no spanking.\n\n \n You strike me as the type who's never had kids, nor been around kids that defy your best case textbook examples.

The way you paint it the parents catch their kids being bad, beat them savagely, and then toss them aside without ever explaining anything, leaving their kids to assume that it's perfectly alright to hurt others for no reason.\n \n \ni said physical punishment is UNNECESSARY.\n\n \n And that's nothing but bull****.

   "Only suitable for minors?:\n \n People used to think it was necessary to \"spank\" adult members of the community, college students, military trainees, and prisoners. In some countries they still do. In our country, it is considered sexual battery if a person over the age of 18 is \"spanked\", but only if over the age of 18.\n \n For one thing, because the buttocks are so close to the anal region, sex organs, and so multiply linked to sexual nerve centers, striking them can trigger powerful and involuntary sexual stimulus in some people. There are numerous physiological ways in which it can be intentionally or unintentionally sexually abusive, but I won't list them all here. One can read the testimony, documentation, and educational resources available from the website of Parents and Teachers Against Violence In Education.\n \n Child bottom-battering vs. DISCIPLINE:\n \n Child bottom-battering (euphemistically labeled \"spanking\",\"swatting\",\"switching\",\"smacking\", \"paddling\",or other cute-sounding names) for the purpose of gaining compliance is nothing more than an inherited bad habit.\n \n Its a good idea for people to take a look at what they are doing, and learn how to DISCIPLINE instead of hit.\n \n There are several reasons why child bottom-battering isn't a good idea. Here are some good, quick reads recommended by professionals:\n \n Plain Talk About Spanking\n by Jordan Riak\n \n The Sexual Dangers of Spanking Children\n by Tom Johnson\n \n NO VITAL ORGANS THERE, So They Say\n by Lesli Taylor MD and Adah Maurer PhD\n \n Just a handful of those helping to raise awareness of why child bottom-battering isn't a good idea:\n \n American Academy of Pediatrics,\n American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,\n American Psychological Association,\n Center For Effective Discipline,\n Churches' Network For Non-Violence,\n Nobel Peace Prize recipient Archbishop Desmond Tutu,\n Parenting In Jesus' Footsteps,\n Global Initiative To End All Corporal Punishment of Children,\n United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.\n \n In 31 nations, child corporal punishment is prohibited by law (with more in process). In fact, the US was the only UN member that did not ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The US also has the highest incarceration rate in the world.\n \n The US states with the highest crime rates and the poorest academic performance are also the ones with the highest rates of child corporal punishment. \n \n There is simply no evidence to suggest that child bottom-battering instills virtue.",

   "It's times like this, I am glad there is homeschooling. If I had a child (and I don't - I'm just an old bachelor with a nephew who crashes at my place from time to time - and a longtime girlfriend as settled in her habits), I would homeschool if they had corporeal punishment. That's the stuff of stories from turn-of-the-century America or friends who became ex-recovering-Catholics.\n \n I don't know what to say about parenting. Parenting is tough work. Obviously, it's not the best course of action. But we have enough people in prison and enough things criminalized. There is also the economics in this issue. A lot of poorer families under economic stress resort to corporeal punishment maybe more because of these stresses. (Though it is a thing that crosses socioeconomic borders. Rich people beat their kids too. Or do things, psychologically, that can be even more damaging than physical punishment.) So who would get hit with these laws the hardest in the U.S.? The poorer, of course.\n \n It's pretty clear that public schools in general have risen above corporeal punishment. It is not something that belongs in the hands of the state, and it goes against what we know about the best ways to educate children.\n \n The only time I could understand a teacher using violence would be in self-defense. But in that case, the child who is violent does not belong in a regular classroom.",
