   "Wow. There have been some very dumb and stupid statements based off of ignorance in this thread. As Liberty has already said, gilligan, I challenge you to research and learn more about home education than basing your opinions off of your fallible views. \n \n First, how does homeschooling encourage anti-socialism? There are many extracurricular activities that can performed outisde of the homeschooling environment. I don't know where you live, however, here, there are many projects that have started in which anyone can join, regardless of how you school. Some examples are, reading clubs here at our local libraries, fitness groups for kids and teens sponsered by local gyms, (I attended one last summer) sports activities not associated with a particular school, and many more. In fact, just recently, on weekends, my neighboor has been putting a sign in her yard about a gymnastics team that anyone, from any school can attend.\n \n Secondly, what is the main reason for public schooling? I hoped you guessed correctly, to learn. Socialization plays a bigger role in public schools than you would like to think. It's gotten to the point were kids don't care about the teaching aspect, but only bear going (to school) because 1) their parents force them 2) they want to see their friends. At times, when one of my friends says something that is grammatically incorrect, I like to joke around and correct them on it. So far, their responses have been either \"Does it look like I care?\" (one my ex-girlfriend uses a lot) or \"We're not in school now, so it doesn't matter\" (the most common.) I honestly do not see the point in wasting 7 to 8 hours a day, 9 months out of 12, just to socialize and see your friends. An overdose of socialization, in my opinion, is the rationale on why children these days are so anti-smart, (anti-nerd, anti-geek) anti-big words, etc. \n \n Lastly, 'parents should not be able to teach their kids because they don't have the qualifications of a public school teacher?' Pure hogwash! How do having the qualifications to teach help if the kids don't give a XXXX about education except if there's some kind of incentive? The world today relies to much on what someone has attached before their name. The reason homeschooled children are turning out to be more intelligent than their government educated peers is simply because the majority of home educated children embrace education while public educated children fear it will make them look 'geeky' or 'nerdy' or endanger their pathetic form of social status that we call popularity. \n \n Oh yes, before I forget, may someone answer this question I have, please? Who should be responsible for training and bringing up a child? The child's parents, or his or her peers at school?\n \n EDIT: And yet another thing, because of the American belief that you have to have a public school education in order to be happy and/or successful in life, which is unfortunately spread through our prized public schools. Tell me, how much education does one need to become a phenomenal artist? It's sad that so many talents have been ruined and thrown away because kids that couldn't figure out some algebra problem were told they would never amount to anything because they weren't smart enough.",

Once again, I reiterate, do more research before attempting bash-fests and fallacious arguments. I homeschool and I probably have just as many friends as you.

I'd bet the quality of my friends is greater than the quality of the average public school kid's party animal friend.

I have found that some of the best teachers had straight C's, if that, because they can connect with more students. \n My Chemistry teacher is a prime example. He is the genius of our school. Unfortunately, since he learns quickly, he assumes everyone does. I didn't suffer from this, but the majority of the students nearly failed his class. \n Aslo, even though parents may not know the subjects as well (though some do) they know you better than your teacher does. They know how to encourage you, and they know your strenghts and weaknesses, and more importantly, your learning style. \n Once again, being homeschooled does not cut you off from the rest of the world. You still socialize, and meet more people. More importantly, you are not restricted to people your age, like you are in a class room. I had friends 5-10 years older than me when I was homeschooled, and they taught me things my parents couldn't, and teachers couldn't. \n I think homeschooling is better off in the long run.",

   "Thought I'd chime in with my two cents. Personally, I see the merits in homeschooling as they've been pointed out here, specialized attention, learning at your pace, less exposure to the \"dangerous\" elemetnts that may leak into some public schools, etc etc. \n \n However, I would, and do, support public education over homschooling, for a few reasons. One, with public education you set a standard everyone has to reach. Granted, I'm sure plenty of homeschoolers already surpass this standard, but there are some who do not, and if they had been in a public school, they might have made it. Teachers, counselors and other staff are trained to watch for kids who are falling behind, while a parent may have all the good intentions on the world but not be able to realise their child is slipping. \n \n Two, it has been said that homeschooling does not make one anti-social, and I'll agree with that. But I think that public school forces one to socialize to the xtent that they will be prepared in a much more thorough way for the real world. We all know it isnt roses and sunshine out there, and being exposed to some of the tough decisions in a public school can make sure people are prepared for what is ahead. \n \n Thirdly, it has been said over and over in this thread that public schools all suck, they teach garbage, etc etc. I would disagree wholeheartedly with this statement. Sure, we hear about the horror cases that some inner-city schools have become, but believe me, this is the exception, not the rule. I attended one of the best public school systems in the country, and recieved an education that I would deem far superior to what my parents could have taught me. Now, before anyone lambasts my parents for being stupid, just let me tell you both have PhDs, my mother is in charge of the heat shield division of NASA, and my father teaches at Cal, one of the top public universities in the country, if not the world. \n \n Finally, a public school opens one to many varrying points of view. From teachers and students, one can see a whole spectrum of thought, religion, belief, and creed. Homeschooling however tends to be dominated by religious parents who want to instill their beliefs in their children. Now, there doesnt happen to be anything wrong with wanting your children to share your beliefs, but it is only fair to allow them to se the other choices out there first. Sure, it is possible to know about other views if you're homeschooled, but it isn't as forward and direct, one must go above and beyond to see what others are like. \n \n Ok, I think thats enough for now, my hands are gettin sore from typing all that.",
