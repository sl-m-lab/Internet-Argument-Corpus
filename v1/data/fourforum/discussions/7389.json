Some groups are discussing ways to respond.\n \n \"It's improper to use the egg roll for political purposes,\" said Mark Tooley of the conservative Institute on Religion and Democracy. Tooley wrote a critical article this week in the Weekly Standard magazine about the planned event that has circulated widely on conservative Web sites.\"\n Hey, you know, I don't get it. I mean, what would be their motivation for using this event as a protest? It's not like it's some anti-gay event or something. It's not like anyone has any evidence or even any accusation that they've blocked gays from attending this thing ever. What's the deal? Gay people act like people shouldn't accuse them of being in-your-face all the time, but what are people supposed to think when stunts like this are pulled?\n \n I see two problems here. One--that these gay people would use a benign event like this for an in-your-face tactic. And two--that they would use their kids for politics by getting them to go to this thing for ulterior motives. That's just wrong. I don't see how that's much different than anti-gay parents using their kids by getting to join Fred Phelps protests. (He sometimes has kids involved, from what I've heard.)\n \n Anyway, this is just strange.",

It's when activists try to take over non-political events for their pet issues that we're talking about.\n \n As far as using kids for a political tool, have you ever watched the easter egg roll on television? I have. It's not an event for 13 year olds, but for little children. They race, rolling easter eggs across the White House lawn. Now if a gay family just came and brought their children to do that, I'd be fine with that. But that's not why these groups are doing this--the article makes it clear that the gay parents are being recruited (yes, recruited) by a gay rights organization to show up en masse.

I was attempting to negate the idea that these children are mis-used or do not have vested interest in dispelling ugly myths about their families when their families face discrimination based upon those myths. If Christain groups can make damning claims about how gays are bad for children or not fit parents, then by God, gay families can respond and show them wrong - ESPECIALLY since they ARE wrong.\n \n And why would I not bring up my life experiences and my son in these discussions? They directly impact our lives and the lives of people we love.\n \n I don't find \"concern\" for the children of gay children to be hollow because of sexual orientation. I find it so when one is obviously and seriously vexed when a gay person does something besides shut up and stay in the closet.",

   "There is a difference between being a part of the event, and being see as part of the event.\n \n Gay Families are considered invisable. This is a well publicized event, gay families are making an effort to attend, and not be invisable. Everyone wearing the same t-shirt is no different than a church group all wearing the same t-shirt and I bet that happens. What if all the \"Smith\" familiy said everyone go to the eggroll and wear blue! WOuld that be a protest?\n \n I think you are trying so hard to make it something it is not.\n \n They are are showing up, wearing a similar or same shirt and participating in the event like all the others families. So take away the gay factor. Say it is the \"Smith\" family.\n\n I actually think it would be dumb to have \"Smith family\" shirts unless you are just trying to make sure your family doesn't get lost. If the \"smith family\" is trying to get TV coverage and make a deal about them being the smith family then I would be just as against what this group is doing. \n \n I honestly think that if you are a gay family that if you go with normal shirts and normal intentions (ie the child) then you will be making a stand far greater than anything this group is trying to do...why you ask? Because you are showing that you family is the same...by wearing the t-shirts you make yourself stand out as if you wanted to be seen as a different kind of family..and it will reflect as a bad family since you aren't there for your child.",

How in the world would anyone even notice if the gay families were there if they didn't do something like shirts? It is not like they are taking a poll on the way in the gate...\n \n Are you a gay familiy...okay come in\n \n are you a straight family...okay over there to the left of the eggs....\n \n Are you a single parent household family...okay...stay in a single file line and smile at the president...\n \n This is a necessary part of this action. I am sure you can see the need for such a thing. \n \n What if the smith family just wanted to go and make a big showing of the smith family....look amercia....look at all the smiths coming out today to show they're american doing the amercian thing....is this bad?

Now, if everyone there got a 'Love Makes A Family' T-shirt then I think that might send a positive message and wouldn't draw attention away from anyone. I would say thats the best idea.\n\n \n The key in your argument that lends its support to this action is the last few phrases. The group behind this has already said the shirts will have a non-political message. I even think love makes a family is too strong since it is associated with gay bumper stickers. My understanding is that the shirts will not say anything political. Coming from the source, I believe they will be tasteful. They idea is not to draw attention \"away\" from anyone, but call attention in a direct action to something. \n \n Remember when I gave you the \"smith family', I said they would all wear blue shirts. I never said the shirts are to say anything and many people won't even get that they are with the \"smith\" family, but the point needed to be made will be made. No attention will be drawn away from anyone. The familes at the event may not \"get it\" but the leadership in the admin will. That is the point. This isn't about making a statement to the people there at the Egg Roll, it is about making a non-violent statement to the \"powers that be\"\n \n I do know that this \"direct action\" is from the principals of non-violent resistance. From that I know it will not hurt or degrade anyone, but simply bring the truth in love. That is one of the main principals of non-violence. Both Gandhi and MLK, Jr. were followers of non-violence. I am as well. SoulForce is as well. I can assure you no attention will be taken away from anyone. But the truth in love will be seen and brought to those who need it. \n \n I would suggest to you that you really investigate this \"direct action\" as Gandhi would call it, before you jump to the conclusion with jyoshu that is is all wrong. You may actually find, you support it. Visit the site, read about it, visit soulforce, I will even send you the email sent to me by soulforce if you would like so you can look at the language.\n \n It is not what jyoshu makes it to be.",

My question is...if you are such great parents why aren't you with your kid instead of talking to the TV camera about your personal message?

(Which is odd, since the Easter Egg Hunt is a pagan tradition.)\n \n As for families in the DC area, I can see why they might want to go. The DC government has made repeated efforts to recognize gay couples and gay families and has often been struck back by administration policies and by the GOP-controlled Congress. Seeing gay families might open some GOP eyes.\n \n That said, I think participation is fine. I think the t-shirts are unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate (haven't seen what they say). \n \n As for \"protest\", if one's actual participation is \"protest\", then something does in fact need to be protested.\n \n As for \"selfishness\", spending a day going on an egg hunt sounds like something the kids might enjoy.

What I took away from this converstion is this; it is not those who are convinced about marriage being a hetero institution, it is the others who do not prescribe to this definition that we have to convince. The ones who value equality and are willing to set things to rights and as you say they are also the ones who do not like an extreme view. I understand now, what you are tring to say and I will try and act accordingly.",

   "Think about this,(not just mathew) \n \n The enemy is not the one that disgrees with you, but the untruth they believe to be truth. We are not fighting people, we are fighting idealogy that says we are not at the same level as others when it comes to marriage. I offer you this, We are! \n \n It is not the other people that are the enemy, it is the ideology that they are they only one entitled to marriage. When you inform those who do not understand we have a need and a right to marriage. A lot will change and without violence of speech, mind, or hand.",
