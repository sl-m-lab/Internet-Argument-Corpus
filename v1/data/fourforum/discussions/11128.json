Not to mention that even today, reptiles, which dinos are, grow for their complete lives. So although there was a slightly higher oxygen level, it wasn't the reason for larger growth of reptiles.\n The article relates the prolific plant growth to the huge size of the herbivorous (plant eating) dinosaurs of the Cretaceous and the carnivorous beasts who preyed on them. It makes sense.\n \n What intriques me however, is what caused these very high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide? Estimates are as great as 500% greater than they are today? (As much as 2000 ppm (parts per million) versus today's approximate 350 ppm.) Some say this was caused by increased volcanic activity. I don't think so.\n \n It is well known that as water warms, its ability to hold dissolved CO2 decreases. Since the world's oceans contain approximately 97% of all the CO2 on Earth, any warming of the oceans would release great amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. This would of course increase plant growth, enable dinosaurs to grow to enormous sizes, and create these extremely thick coal beds.\n \n What caused the warming? It sure wasn't man's burning of fossil fuels over one hundred million years ago. The warming was probably primarily caused by changes in solar activity. Later, the climate cooled, the oceans absorbed more CO2, limiting plant growth, starving the dinosaurs, and ending the massive deposition of plant material making up the thick coal beds. This is a simplified summary, but the idea is supported by geologic evidence from all around the world. This is a \"working hypothesis\". What do you think?\n http://petesplace-peter.blogspot.com/2008/01/how-dinosaurs-got-so-bigwarming-in.html",

You tried to argue that Co2 was the primary reason for large growth.

You posted a link that said that increased Co2 levels were responsible for large growth in arthropods. The problem is as I have explained, arthropods don't have the same methods for internal transportation of O2 within their bodies. O2 is required for the various processes to produce the chemicals required for ATP production. Thus, increased Co2 has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with how arthropods grew to such massive sizes. It's obvious that larger bodies require more ATP. But without a method of vastly increasing access to O2, there is no way of producing that on a sustainable level, especially for something that has a wing span of over 2 meters and that has a respiratory system that runs on diffusion. I don't actually think you think that Co2 is the primary input, I know you don't know jack about this subject. I was just trying to force you to back up your fantastically stupid argument. The argument you gave REALLY takes the cake for utter and sheer stupidity. \n \n \nYou see oc, once again, rather than being able to comprehend a different perspective of the same question, you ignorantly attack that perspective as if its nonsensical.\n\n \n It is nonsensical.

You are dishonestly trying to weasel out of your fantastically ignorant argument. Nowhere in your posts or the article did it discuss the impact of Oxygen on the world and its organisms.

I've already explained what the article did. Since you FAILED to correct me, I'm assuming I got it right (which I did in the first place and just copy-pasted). Co2 of course leads to more temperate climate, which has more vegetation. The problem is Co2 doesn't have the ability to allow the Krebs Cycle to function. Without increased Krebs Cycle activity, there is no additional ATP production. In organisms that rely on diffusion, with a massive increase on oxygen to fuel the Krebs Cycle, they can't produce more ATP. Without more ATP, their bodies can't grow larger.\n \n You keep failing to understand very basics of biology respiration and thus why your argument is fantastically stupid. \n \n \nBut no, you immediately revert to a flame fest as you ignorantly insist that you're right and everyone else must be wrong.\n\n \n See above.

   "Maybe this has been said. Apologies for repetition.\n \n Archie, \n You seem to be missing an important point. \n \n Arthropods (insects) have tracheal breathing. It is different from lungs. Because of that, there are physical limits to their body size. It has nothing to do with how much they eat, even if increased CO2 made lots of plants. CO2 has nothing to do with this. \n \n This gets to be like one of those \"madcap\" annoying comedies where two characters continue to misundertand one other. If only someone would speak up and explain!!! I watch these repeated exchanges and I am butting in hopefully to clarify this as it seems to me these facts are being missed by some parties.\n\n \n Actually I posted that in post #10\n \n \"But insects don't have veins and their trachea function through oxygen naturally through ventilation or simple diffusion. They lack the ability to transfer large amounts of diffused oxygen through their bodies. That's what keeps them small: they can't get enough oxygen to fuel larger bodies.\"\n \n Arch got the fact. He doesn't want to admit it or account for it.\n \n Perhaps he is willfully staying ignorant?",

You are right, the only reasonable conclusion is that he must be willfully ignorant. If he wasn't such a horrible little man, I might actually feel sorry for him. The poor little feller wants so much to be RIGHT just ONCE, but he fails miserably every time. Kinda like a Charlie Brown, only thoroughly unlikable.",

It is correctly spelled twice in the first post and three count 'em three species were given. If you bothered to google any of them you'd obviously know what I was talking about. Furthermore, the three I gave are three of the best know, a giant dragonfly, a giant millipede and a giant spider. All of which are giant arthropods.\n \n Furthermore, the term was never missing the R since.\n \n And I suspect you are indeed lying. If you only read the title you wouldn't understand what the subject was about. The size of these giant insects wasn't even alluded to in the title. \n \n I think you're trying to weasel out again. You read my refutation. It clearly talked about insects. The word \"Trachea\" comes to mind especially in the context of diffusion. How many vertebrates do you know of that breath through trachea via diffusion?\n \n Are going to admit you're wrong?\n \n And I just ran a google search for \"athropod\"\n \n Here are the results\n \n the first three are OBVIOUSLY about insects, the first two about management of pests.",
