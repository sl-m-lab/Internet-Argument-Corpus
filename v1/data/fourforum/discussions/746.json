   "Ok, as a slight change from the debates here( which always seem to become overly religious in some cases) lets just focus on an evolution topic. I am curious to know if anyone has opinions on the subject of memes, or the basic building blocks of our minds and culture, similar in respect to genes. I found a halfway decent website on it for those who know nothing about memes, or haven't read Dawkin's Selfish Gene http://www.memecentral.com/ \n \n The question I really want to know is, what people's opinions on this matter is. Do memes seem plausible? Do you think that they are subject to the same evolutionary mechanisms as genes, and behave just as genes do? I'm curious, as when I first read about memes a few years ago I was very skeptical of the idea, but eventually I realized that the idea has more merit that I originally thought. Discuss!",

   "I remember when I first heard about memes. It was some Discovery/TLC/AnimalPlanet show and they were talking about two different groups of chimps and how they would get to bugs to eat (I think they were termites). Anyways, one group would place a stick down the termite hole and then when the termites grasped on, they'd pull out the stick and lick em off. The other group would just bash the termite colony and then eat the ones they found. Eventually one of the Stick Chimps got into the camp of the Bash Chimps and over time, more of the Bash Chimps started using the stick method (better because the colony lasts longer - more food, I guess). \n \n Beyond that example as the basic idea of them, I don't know much. Maybe I'll look into that site.",
