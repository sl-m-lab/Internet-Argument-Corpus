You really have to be trained or train yourself in order to be proficient at it. Killing Capacity as you put it, depends on the user.

   "I've already mentioned it. Control guns much harder than currently, and encourage Americans to consider the viable alternatives for self-defence and home protection - mace, tasers, smart water, burglar/rape alarms, etc\n\n \n I greatly dislike these less-lethal methods that so many people support, to me it cheapens the value of the life of the victim, it suggests that it's more important that the attacker not die than the victim come to no harm.\n \n Another issue is that it fails to take into account the fact that this world isn't run on less-lethal situations, there won't always be an opportunity for both the victim and the attack to come out alive and part company when the police get there to break it up. The wait times for police response in this country are miserable at best, and intolerable at worst. Once somebody has broken into your house and is trying to break down your bedroom door, being forced to wait 15 minutes for rescue is absolutely unreasonable. And unless that door is mahogany it's not going to last 15 minutes against a determined invader/attacker.\n \n \nIf I had to run the country... firstly, I would probably set up a system that holds owners responsible for their weapons.

The aim of this regulation would be to prevent straw purchases, and to ensure a gun is kept securely in a house.\n\n \n One of the things I decided to undertake when I finally became an American was learning just what is the law regarding guns in this country, and to say it was an undertaking is an understatement.\n \n In several states a licensing and registration system like what you propose is in place and is the law. Guns can't be owned without them first being registered with the police, and all future transfer of the weapon MUST go through a licensed dealer so a paper trail exists. Despite such regulations in effect, the states that have them continue to be known for their high rates of crime and victimization.\n \n This registration system has also been used as the stepping stone in a statewide firearms confiscation order in California, back in the 1990s. All owners of SKS rifles were ordered by by the Attorney General to turn their registered guns in for destruction.\n \n \nOver a much longer period of time, I would attempt to change the system of licence granting -\n\n \n On the federal level there's no need to obtain a license to own or purchase a gun, this is only done locally in a handful of select states.\n \n \nusing gun amnesties, 'buy back' programmes,\n\n \n The same programs which many have testified about being a waste of taxpayer money and doing nothing to solve any crimes or reduce the number of guns in the hands of criminals?\n \n \npolice crackdowns and similar methods to smooth the transition from gun to non-gun.\n\n \n Like the plan Washington DC tried to implement, where the police could stop you as a checking station, demand identification, and deny you travel unless you had \"valid reason\" for driving down the street?\n \n \nThe end result would be guns (or ammo) being sold, but only if a valid reason for purchase is given where 'self-defence' is not a valid reason (except for in extreme circumstances). This restricts purchase to sport or work-related ownership.\n\n \n Now just a minute. How exactly is self-defense not considered a valid reason for gun ownership? Are you saying that trying to avoid being murdered isn't a good enough reason for owning or using a gun? What are you, one of these nuts who supports \"the rights of the victimizers and violators\" who think that the intended victim shouldn't be allowed to kill their mugger, rapist or kidnapper?",

Ask me how I know? Tasers only work if you hit your target and you are left vulnerable if they miss. Alarms only send police to your place most of the time too late if the suspects wants to kill you, not everyone can afford it, could fail. Registering never works and extremely costly. People can just lie to the government anyways and you would have to violate some Constitution rights in order make sure they have those weapons. Buy backs also never work. All that does is make people get rid of their junk guns, in other words, guns that do not work at all. Controlling ammo is even worst. Doesn't work and would skyrocket prices for the regular owner, who is the guy who works 9 to 5. Self defense is a valid reason to have a gun.

   "But guns don't kill people, people kill people!\n\n \n Why Penfold are you starting get it? What you seem to ignore is that there are many things that can be used to kill knives, base ball bats, scarves, screw drivers, rocks, axes, bottles, chain saws, piano wire, etc. In all these instances there is one commonalty that is there is a human there wielding it. It doesn't matter what the intended purpose of this particular thing is. It's just that about anything can be used to kill whether it was designed for that purpose or not. To trim one of the branches off that tree does nothing. To get to the problem you need to go to the root cause, Man. Ergo humans kill.",

   "Alright Charlie I'll bite: how do you know a coke-head can't be effectively dropped with a defensive chemical spray?\n\n \n Cops came over by our apartment complex one night. The dude was as high as a kite. When the cops came they tried to apprehend him (two cops) they couldn't, he was obviously seriously pumped up. Watched it all from my 2nd floor window. One pulled out some mace and sprayed some of the stuff on his face. DIDN'T work!! The guy was still fighting and kicking etc. While he might have been blinded, crying, whatever he still was fighting which means all it really does is give you a chance to run like hell! In this case they were trying to apprehend him and they used a strong agent which usually works on anyone, but they still had to taser the dude to finally get him to give up. The problem with some commercial sprays is they may or may not contain certain chemicals that tend to be more or less effective on dudes that are high or drunk, etc. There is also the chance you can miss or that you hesitate and leave your self open. Also some of these sprays can wear out over time making them less useful.",

   "I greatly dislike these less-lethal methods that so many people support, to me it cheapens the value of the life of the victim, it suggests that it\\'s more important that the attacker not die than the victim come to no harm.\n\n Only if you take the view of an individual circumstance. In the bigger picture, non-lethal defence methods are better because they cannot be used to victimise anyone.\n \n \nAnother issue is that it fails to take into account the fact that this world isn\\'t run on less-lethal situations, there won\\'t always be an opportunity for both the victim and the attack to come out alive and part company when the police get there to break it up. The wait times for police response in this country are miserable at best, and intolerable at worst. Once somebody has broken into your house and is trying to break down your bedroom door, being forced to wait 15 minutes for rescue is absolutely unreasonable. And unless that door is mahogany it\\'s not going to last 15 minutes against a determined invader/attacker.\nWith regard to the bolded - I thought that the US was much better than the UK?\n \n Are there really that many attackers that come into your house with the intent of harming you?\n \n \n\n In several states a licensing and registration system like what you propose is in place and is the law. Guns can\\'t be owned without them first being registered with the police, and all future transfer of the weapon MUST go through a licensed dealer so a paper trail exists. Despite such regulations in effect, the states that have them continue to be known for their high rates of crime and victimization.\n \n This registration system has also been used as the stepping stone in a statewide firearms confiscation order in California, back in the 1990s. All owners of SKS rifles were ordered by by the Attorney General to turn their registered guns in for destruction.\n\n See: other topics, and why comparing states is a useless task.\n \n What was the reason for the confiscation of the rifles?\n \n \nThe same programs which many have testified about being a waste of taxpayer money and doing nothing to solve any crimes or reduce the number of guns in the hands of criminals?\n\n The very same. You have testimonials against, I have testimonials for.\n \n \nLike the plan Washington DC tried to implement, where the police could stop you as a checking station, demand identification, and deny you travel unless you had \"valid reason\" for driving down the street?\n\n Similar, but less invasive.\n \n \nNow just a minute. How exactly is self-defense not considered a valid reason for gun ownership? Are you saying that trying to avoid being murdered isn\\'t a good enough reason for owning or using a gun? What are you, one of these nuts who supports \"the rights of the victimizers and violators\" who think that the intended victim shouldn\\'t be allowed to kill their mugger, rapist or kidnapper?\n\n People always get this wrong.\n \n Self-defence is good. Giving people lethal tools for the purposes of self-defence is bad, and leads to abuse of the tools.\n \n \nA gun isn\\'t the only thing that can kill. \nIt just so happens that guns are designed to be lethal weapons. \n",

   "[QUOTE]\nOnly if you take the view of an individual circumstance. In the bigger picture, non-lethal defence methods are better because they cannot be used to victimise anyone.\n\n \n Hogwash. Less-lethal devices can and have been used for torture purposes in the past, I would hardly count that as \"nobody\\'s being victimized, it\\'s impossible with these tools\".\n \n The United Nations has even released their official position on it, the use of tasers and other such devices amounts to nothing more than pure torture. Tasers a form of torture, says UN | The Daily Telegraph \n \n \nWith regard to the bolded - I thought that the US was much better than the UK?\n\n \n What\\'s the average UK police response time to a call for help?\n \n \nAre there really that many attackers that come into your house with the intent of harming you?\n\n \n The UK mindset on harming others is \"Once is more than enough!\" at least that\\'s what the response to Dunblane suggested. Are you saying that mindset is wrong, that a single incident isn\\'t a justifiable reason for taking such drastic actions? If that\\'s the case then how many such incidents have to occur to be justified in your eyes; a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand?\n \n \nWhat was the reason for the confiscation of the rifles?\n\n \n The Attorney General changed his mind. When he sent out the registration forms for the SKS he assured people that their rifle was legal under California law, because it wasn\\'t considered an \"assault weapon\" because the magazine is integral to the design. Later, after they were all registered and the people were found out and located, the Attorney General changed his mind and sent out letters informing the people that their gun was reclassified as an \"assault weapon\" because it was possible to swap out the fixed magazine well with a detachable magazine.\n \n \nThe very same. You have testimonials against, I have testimonials for.\n\n \n For the sake of argument, what would you be offering these people to convince them to turn in their guns? $200 a piece? You\\'d have to set up an amnesty so all guns turned in wouldn\\'t be checked against crime records, otherwise any criminal looking to ditch a gat wouldn\\'t drop it off with the police. That means you\\'d have to be willing to let potential crimes remain unsolved in the name of getting rid of guns that can\\'t normally confiscate.\n \n $200 a gun, sounds tempting; especially for a profiteer. Here you can get those zinc guns in puny calibers for about $100, and if these gun buybacks operate on a \"no questions asked\" policy somebody could just show up with a crate full of these cheap junkers and make back twice what they spent, and bankrupt the program.\n \n \nSimilar, but less invasive.\n\n \n What would you suggest then?\n \n \nPeople always get this wrong.\n\n \n And why do you think that is?\n \n \nSelf-defence is good. Giving people lethal tools for the purposes of self-defence is bad, and leads to abuse of the tools.\n\n \n Somebody could use their sports gun to kill an attacker, would you prefer that? Would it make you more comfortable if you suspected people were lying on the application forms and putting \"sporting use\" as reason for ownership when they were really buying a gun so that the next person that chose to victimize them would be found dead by the police?",
