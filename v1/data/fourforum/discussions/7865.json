   "It is clear that the Bush Administration will draw some sort of line in the sand with their new Mexican slave labor policy. But the rhetoric here in the Pacific Northwest has become increasingly elevated in the past week and uniquely not from the socialists. A point has been made that the Bush Administration was choosing a communist illiterate racist peasant indian over their constituency, this is true. They are choosing a neo-slave over their bread and butter. Out with the $45,000+ a year family man, who follows all the rules, pays taxes, obeys the laws, bears the brunt of the administrations mistakes and supports the war in Iraq. This administration is wiling to throw this demographic to the lions for what they think will be a quick vote? Do they actually believe that these nationalist hispanic racist people will vote for them?!?! The rhetoric that is floating around right now speaks to this utter and irreparable betrayal of Americans. And is it not a betrayal? Are we not actually a nation of laws? Because by saying that it is okay for 11-20 million people to break the law, what then is the point of having laws? What do we have then? A nation that is governed not by votes or by laws but by shear numbers of law breakers? Many people in the Puget Sound area, which includes some famous business owners, entrepreneurs, students, laborers and the rest of the old republican constituency are teaming with some unlikely allies. These include some of the very old school democrats and workers unions. There is a lot at stake and it is important that \"our\" administration realize this. NO consideration has been made of the social implications of this and that means our leaders are very detached. I only say this as someone who was born and raised in the southwest so I know all too well about the Mexican flags being shoved in peoples faces. I know all too well about their machismo (the other night on Fox that Mexican professor from UCLA wanted to physically hurt Michelle Malkin, he couldn't stand a woman telling him anything). I also know ALL too well about their violence and lack of reason and nazi-like dedication to MEXICO. I grew up having to make concessions on simple things like intelligent rhetoric, knowledge and patriotism to my country just to fit in! These are the demands being made by these nationalist transformists...they seek their atzlan, their la raza unida-Do we just hand it over? Do we just let our administration destroy us? This is how we are repaid with our loyalty. They expect that they can squeeze this out of us, that we will be here for them regardless. They are counting on the opiate-like calm of our highly taxed houses and uber convenience to make us forget, lose our dignity in a barrage of sound bytes and double speak. For 50 years they have lied to us and we have let it happen. We are a nation of laws. I am not really sure that I want to live in a nation that has betrayed my long life of service, my veteranship, my loyalty and my patriotism. What then do I have left? The comfort of this mexican amnesty quilt? Nothing so porous will ever keep me warm. Is this in fact our own leaders turning the pistol on us for their lust of the moment? Not for me and I must say that this is a line I will not cross. As always, our forefathers have said it best:\n \n A general dissolution of principles and manners will more surely overthrow the liberties of America than the whole force of the common enemy. While the people are virtuous they cannot be subdued; but when once they lose their virtue then will be ready to surrender their liberties to the first external or internal invader.\n Samuel Adams, letter to James Warren, February 12, 1779\n \n Accept nothing less than deportation! They attempt to lose deportation in a mountain of rhetoric citing logistics...But I propose, what cost is the law? Will civil war be our voice?",
