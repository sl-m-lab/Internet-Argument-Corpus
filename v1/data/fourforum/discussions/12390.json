It's not so much that I missed.........\n \n \n .....it's that the target moved.\n \n I believe Shakespeare once said \"Brevity is the soul of wit.\"\n \n Somehow, the short and simple reply required for the subsequent pithy punchline turned into a completely irrellevant argument on the merits of Big O's presidency. This tends to stifle pithyness.\n \n \n Example:\n \n \"Knock, Knock!\"\n \n \"May I inquire as to the identity of the person or persons located adjacent to the anterior entrance of my present domicile\"?\n \n \"Orange.\"\n \n \"Welcome to my humble abode Mr. Orange! Please make yourself at home. Would you like some refreshment?\"\n \n \"......er....ummmmmm?.....\"\n \n See what I mean? It's not that I didn't have a witty response with valid meaning worthy of discussion. It's that the \"straight man\" required to set it up took a nap and was replaced by well meaning, yet hapless, debaters stealing the target and running all over with it. Therefore, as you have stated, I missed.
