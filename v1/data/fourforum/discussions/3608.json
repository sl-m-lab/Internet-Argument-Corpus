After the laughing stops, I'm sure you'll be enlightened.\"\n \n 1954: \"Come to Alabama and try to assert desegregation. After the laughing stops, I'm sure you'll be lynched.\"\n \n How the hell is this an argument? Majoritarean norms don't equate with what is moral. You're implication, that the rights of man are contingent on the grace of the majority in giving them, is not just frightening, but antithetical to the entire American ideal. To quote from Justice Earl Warren:\n \"A citizen's constitutional rights can hardly be infringed simply because a majority of the people choose that it be\" (Lucas v. Colorado General Assembly, 377 US 713)\n Or, if you prefer, Justice Robert Jackson:\n \"The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\" (West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 US 624)\n \n That a majority vote would be seen as vindication for oppression is troubling and deeply saddening. I pray that one day this nation recognizes that equal justice means equal justice for all, and that our shameful policies in this respect go by the way of slavery, racism, sexism, and the other evils that have plagued our nations conscience for so long.",

   "Although Jim and MrWrite's debate has devolved into an unfortunate battle of screw you's, the comparison of the arguments against interacial marriage and those against gay marriage has some merit. At least that's what this article suggests:\n \n Opponents of gay marriage use many of the same arguments as foes of interracial relationships did before Loving v. Virginia outlawed state bans on interracial marriage in 1967, said law professor Kim Forde-Mazrui at a talk sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Law and Lambda Law Alliance Sept. 30.\n \n http://www.law.virginia.edu/home2002/html/news/2004_fall/forde.htm\nThis is not relevant to my argument at all. I have mentioned nothing about religious beliefs or bible-thumping protests against homosexuality. I did not bring interacial marriage into the discussion because it does not apply. I'm not against interacial marriage as long as there's a man and a woman involved.\n \n I did not bring the silly argument about water fountains into the discussion.\n \n Separate-but-equal does apply in the sense that records of legally recognized couples would separate married couples from same-sex couples but would not justify any inequalities regarding their rights and privileges. Hospital visitation, inheritance and other things could be afforded both.\n \n I'm wondering if those who insist on same-sex couples being called \"married\" are not acting somewhat from self-imposed shame...like you want to hide the fact that you are gay.\n \n My argument has thusfar been limited to the requirement to redefine several other words if we redefine \"marriage\". It has nothing to do with homophobia which, by the way, I do not suffer from. I have some friends that are gay and they know how I feel about the word \"marriage\". We remain friends.",

   "And by the way, what is a \"legitimate dislike\" of homosexuality?\nLike I said, accepting homosexuals is not required. People have a right to like or dislike or even hate anyone they so choose. It's acting on the hatred that is illegal.\n \n \n\n Not liking, say, Asians, isn't against the law.\nExactly.\n \n \n \n\n Suppose an employer with a \"legitimate dislike\" of Asians invited one of his employees whom he'd never met face to face to his home for a dinner party. To his horror, he discovers the man is Asian.\n \n Who's fault in the \"confusion\" there? Should the employer insist that a new term be created to distinguish between Asian & non-Asian employees to avoid such confusion in the future?\nIf the employer owns the company, he can hire who he chooses for any reason. He can fire who he chooses for any reason.\n \n \n\n Or should he just get over his irrational prejudice and stop dividing people into \"us\" vs. \"them,\" when \"they\" aren't negatively impacting him one iota?\nIf he dislikes any certain group, he is justified in his own mind to distance himself from members of that group. It is not required that you like or accept any member of any group.\n \n True, it would be peaceful and we'd likely all be happier if we all accepted everybody as they are and bore no animosity whatsoever...but that is not the case. If someone does not like me, I will not try to force them to associate with me. As long as they do not harm me, I can live without their influence.

   "Think they are gay? What do you mean?\n\n \n I'm not convinced that \"gay\" as a state of being is not overstated. I think there is some degree of psychology to being gay, but not to the degree that it is an obvious state of being, such as the way an African American person is black. Being gay is probably psychologically along the same lines as being prone to prefer certain things. Of course the gay lobby would like people to think that sexuality is some sort of prominent trait, therefore giving them credence on par with, say, an ethnic group identity. The only identifying trait of a gay person would be his or her gender preference in relationships. Personally, I'd hate to think that sexuality wold play so big a role in my life that my life revolved around it and that it was the basis of what constituted getting 'rights' for me. There is so much more to life than a matter like sexual preference.\n \n \nJudicial activism=any decision the oppostion doesn't like. Often the government is too chicken to stand up for women and minorities. Because they go to court, that doesn't make them dishonest.\n\n \n Regardless, there are avenues in place that allow for laws to be created for this sort of thing. In the 1960s, we saw civil rights for black people being ushered in in the form of a Constitutional amendment, not merely backdoor judicial activism which seeks to take advantage of liberal judges. Gay activist groups know that they have a lot better chance to circumvent due process by taking advantage of ONE liberal judge's views, rather than a prolonged fight in public opinion and congress. The good thing is that these attempts of judical activism aren't working. It is safe to say that this recent election was one backlash of trying to usher in gay marriage under the radar. If gay lobbying groups want to use such tactics, they will pay the price (and have). For most of America, the jury is still out on whether or not this is even a civil rights issue, and just because gay activist groups say it is doesn't make it so. You aren't going to convince most of America to give up their religious beliefs so easily regarding marriage.",

   "I don't \"think\" I am gay, I know that I am gay. I have known since a very young age,\n\n \n No one really even knows for sure what \"being gay\" is. To make matters worse, in some people it exists in varying degrees. Gay people have sought to explain this by coming up with concepts like \"bi-sexuality.\" But as you should know, people can not so easily be fit into neat little groups of sexual preference. A man may go most of his life being attracted to women, but one day see one man he has an attraction for. That does not make him gay. If you can show me, unequivically as proof, what \"gay\" is, then by all means do so. But even experts are not all in agreement.

There are plenty of people who have experienced that at one time or another in life but that doesn't mean they are \"gay\".\n \n \nI have no desire to change any thing about your heterosexual marriage rights, I do seek those rights to be extended to my relationship.\n\n \n That's fine, and such could be worked out if you are open to it. Civil unions could be made portable and with similar (if not the same) rights as marriage. But by trying to change the accepted definition/standard of marriage in most people's minds, you are essentially asking people to turn their backs on a lifetime of moral and religious belief. And that isn't going to happen so easily. I would think the recent election results would make this very clear. You may say you aren't expecting that, but whether you realize it or not, you are. \n \n \nThis whole theory of marriage already being available to all is bogus. It implys that marraige is available to individuals not couples. You cannot have the right of marriage as an individual only as a couple.\n\n \n It is an individual right--it just only available with marriage to another, in which case both receive that individual right. All rights are individual rights. \n \n \nThe Judicial system is part of the proper system under the law available to US citizens. Our government has three branches and citizens may use the judicial branch to settle disputes such as not feeling equal protection under the law. There is nothing dishonest about using your goverment the way it was designed to be used.\n\n \n The judicial system is not there to create law, but to interpret laws already on the books and make sure they are applied correctly. True constitutionalism in the courts would never make laws say anything not implied or stated in the constitution. To gain marriage rights for relationships other than marriage as it is accepted in our culture, you need to have an amendment that is not already there. That is a valid option for you, and you can certain pursue it. It is why the founding fathers allowed for amendments to be added.",

   "I'm not convinced that \"gay\" as a state of being is not overstated. I think there is some degree of psychology to being gay, but not to the degree that it is an obvious state of being, such as the way an African American person is black. Being gay is probably psychologically along the same lines as being prone to prefer certain things. Of course the gay lobby would like people to think that sexuality is some sort of prominent trait, therefore giving them credence on par with, say, an ethnic group identity.\n\n \n Sexuality is a prominent trait. Watch TV, a movie, read a book, talk and interact with others, and see if you can't easily see expressions of sexuality.\n \n \nThe only identifying trait of a gay person would be his or her gender preference in relationships.\n\n \n Yes.\n \n \nPersonally, I'd hate to think that sexuality wold play so big a role in my life that my life revolved around it and that it was the basis of what constituted getting 'rights' for me. There is so much more to life than a matter like sexual preference.\n\n \n Then I guess straight people wouldn't mind at all if they didn't have protection and supports for their relationships, and if they were discriminated against in other ways based on their sexual orientation. I suppose they wouldn't make a big deal out of it, if the situation of discrimination was reversed against them, because there is so much more to life than sexuality.\n \n \nRegardless, there are avenues in place that allow for laws to be created for this sort of thing. In the 1960s, we saw civil rights for black people being ushered in in the form of a Constitutional amendment, not merely backdoor judicial activism which seeks to take advantage of liberal judges.\n\n \n There's a difference here. The defition of marriage is common law, not statuatory law. The common law definition of marriage was created by judges. Common law allows for the latitude of interpretation by judges in accordance with an evolving society.\n \n \nGay activist groups know that they have a lot better chance to circumvent due process by taking advantage of ONE liberal judge's views, rather than a prolonged fight in public opinion and congress. The good thing is that these attempts of judical activism aren't working. It is safe to say that this recent election was one backlash of trying to usher in gay marriage under the radar. If gay lobbying groups want to use such tactics, they will pay the price (and have). For most of America, the jury is still out on whether or not this is even a civil rights issue, and just because gay activist groups say it is doesn't make it so. You aren't going to convince most of America to give up their religious beliefs so easily regarding marriage.\n\n \n It's early yet to declare victory for the anti-gay marriage forces. Rights aren't determined merely by these popularity contests and who is holier than whom.",

   "The Goodrich case in Boston put the issue front and center in our Nation's politics, and all over the Nation.\n \n Listen to the court's reasoning: \n \"Civil marriage anchors an ordered society by encouraging stable relationships over transient ones.
