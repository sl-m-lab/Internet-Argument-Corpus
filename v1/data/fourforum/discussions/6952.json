   "Newbie\n Post Score\n Adjustment: n/a\n \n \n \n Rate this post: \n Insightful Poignant Thought Provoking Comprehensive Funny Neutral Obfuscated Paltry Trite Off Topic Ambiguous \n Here are ten reasons why gay marrige should be illegal. Please read everything before responding.\n \n 01) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning. \n \n 02) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall. \n \n 03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract. \n \n 04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal. \n \n 05) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed. \n \n 06) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children. \n \n 07) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children. \n \n 08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America. \n \n 09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children. \n \n 10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.\n \n I hope you get it.",

   "Firstly, I am totally for gay marriage. But I am just as totally against people refusing to see what each others arguments are.\n \n \n01) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.\nUsually 'natural' is used in a Thomian sense: there is nothing against human nature in the other things mentioned. \n \n \n02) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.\nThe conservatives often consider homosexuality action not feeling, and not innate. We can change our actions, and there are clear examples from the ancient world that societies accepting of homosexuality have more of it.\n \n \n03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract. \nThis argument is sometimes used when the entire justification is 'I love them, I wish to marry them'. On the legal front, do those who support gay marriage support polygamy, and if not, why not?\n \n \n04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal. \nThe argument is that there is nothing fundamental in the marriage service, or its religious understandings, that require such things. Those who accept that the services say women are property or that divorce is illegal probably still think that should be the case.\n \n \n05) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.\nThe fact that certain 'less meaningful' marriages can't be stopped doesn't mean others should be expressly allowed. \n \n \n06) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.\nThe argument is more that they can produce children: totally infertile people are rare. Also, this is usually a 'human nature' argument in disguise. \n \n \n07) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children. \nIt doesn't have to be 100% either way. Fascists often raise fascist children, although some fascist children arise in non-fascist families.\n \n \n08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America. \nThey would argue\n 1) that it's all religions, not just one, that oppose homosexuality\n 2) that the term 'marriage' is fundamentally religious.\n \n \n09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.\nWe perform background checks to stop unsuitable people adopting, but if those unsuitable people have children, we don't take the children away and expressly forbid them from raising them.\n \n \n10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.\nI've never actually seen this argument used, but it's probably back with 'human nature' again.",
