And that's because they've recognized that the ideal setting for raising a child is where you have access to both genders.\"\n\n \n Once again he doesn't get it not all heteros get married to have children, certainly not those past breeding age. \n \n Ok I throw my challenge out there to conservatives and christians who think marrriage is about children. \n \n I will renounce all gay claims to marriage if it truely is about children and they adopt the following\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=8573\n \n I have decided that a compromise is in order about marriage. If marriage is, as the christian right has stated, about children then I have some new licensing rules that need to be implemented.\n \n \n 1 If marriage is limited to a man and a women they need to submit proof of fertility to get a license.\n \n 2 they must have a child within a year for the liscense being grated or the license must be surrendered\n \n 3 there can not be any divorce the couple must remain together for the childs welfare.\n \n 4 once the children are grown or if the child dies then the liscense must be surrendered.\n \n 5 only breeding age men and women will be permitted licenses.\n \n 6 proof of consumation, by video or Affidavit of 3 Witnesess must be kept on file at the court house.\n \n 7 the liscense must be renewed, much as a driver liscense is, with tests of parental fitness every 2 years. If found unfit the license is surrendered along with the children.\n \n 8 No one may have children with out a marriage lisence.\n \n I could live with this my sense of equality would be sated since there would also be heterosexual excluded from marriage.",
