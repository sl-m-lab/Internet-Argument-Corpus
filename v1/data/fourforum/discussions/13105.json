   "Sit down and shut up, I'm gonna start pointing out some holes in the arguments of the anti-gunners. There's a lot of holes and inconsistencies so I'm gonna take them one at a time.\n \n Let's start with the whole mexican drug cartel thing.\n \n Many claim that 90% of the guns found in Mexico come from America. Others more accurately point out that only 90% of the portion of the guns that were submitted to the ATF to be traced, came from America; that percentage equaling about 17% of the some 29,000 currently seized.\n \n Mexican ambassador Auturo Sarukhan made the claim that every single day of the year, the authorities in Mexico seize 2,000 guns being smuggled in from America. At the rate of 2,000 guns every day that's 730,000 in one year. For that to be true, that would mean the mexican police are far more corrupt than we thought, since they've only reported 29,000 weapons seized so far; otherwise known as about 0.039% of the total haul.\n \n That would mean that of the so called 90% of guns traced back to America, which came from only about 6,000 submitted to actually be traced, that only 0.0082% of the guns seized could actually be traced back to America.\n \n Now, if Auturo is telling the truth about the 730,000 guns seized every year, and the ATF is accurate in their statement that only 17% of the guns in Mexico came from America, that would have to mean that Mexico has approximately 4,295,000 guns present in the county, just in the private hands of the drug cartels and people not abiding with the laws. And if that's the case, Mexico has much more serious problems than they thought.",
