   "This should come as no surprise, but, if you put any stock in the Project for Excellence in Journalism, it is now official that the media does not like George W. Bush. PEJ, a DC group focused on raising the standard of media journalism, released a report on election coverage during the period of the debates, October 1-14. 59% of the stories about Bush were negative, with 14 percent positive. Kerry received coverage 34% favorable and 25% negative. \n \n The report focused on network news shows, PBS's nightly newscast, CNN's \"Newsnight with Aaron Brown,\" and Fox News's \"Special Report with Brit Hume.\" Also included were 817 stories from the Washington Post, New York Times, Columbus Dispatch, and Miami Herald. \n \n Kerry also leads Bush in the number of newspaper endorsements across the nation, 142 to 123. Although such endorsements in America's op-ed pages don't carry the weight they used to, Kerry clearly relishes such support. He actively canvassed the Orlando Sentinel and the Cleveland Plain Dealer, but in the end the latter paper chose to endorse neither candidate. When measured by circulation, Kerry's endorsements reach a combined 17.5 million subscribers. Bush's endorsements reach 11.5 million readers.",

   "That's quite possible since the incumbent is usually more exposed to criticism of job performance. The challenger usually has less of a record at the task, especially in presidential races.\n\n \n \n I agree too, but when you have a memo from ABC out there stating that they should not focus on Kerry's distortions as much as they should on Bush's, it is simply unfair and unethical in a journalistic sense. I don't mind the fact that news agencies favor one candidate or another, it's human nature. But when they let that feeling take over and the begin to report their opinion and only their opinion, I completely despise it. What is even worse is when someone, like Dan Rather or CNN, has an agenda so big it will do all it can to influence an election. \n \n If the story about Bush and his national guard service was true, I have no problem if they air it. But when the documents prove to be false, and Rather continues to assert the substance is true, and we find out they did no research, I find it completely unacceptable. And about the explosives. If the story was true, go ahead and air it. I have no problem. But what other reason, other than a political agenda, did they have to hold the story under lock and key for 2 weeks and plan to air it 48 hours before we go to the polls? Having a bias or preference towards one candidate is one thing; but intentionally letting that bias or preference effect your news in a way that CBS has is irresponsible.",

Do they become the liberal media only when they fail to endorse your man? The Newspaper in Detroit, which never in it's history has endorsed a Democrat, has endorsed Kerry. Did they suddenly contract liberalism? Bush has picked up 2 newspapers that backed Gore. Have they been cured? The plain fact is we have a President who won office with 47.9% of the vote without a record to run on and now he stands at about the same percentage with a record. I submit that his record has more to do with the endorsements he has lost than the political dogma of the news media.\n Dono",

   "really, you need to find a clue.\n\n \n I think you do. It is quite clear your arguments and facts are deathly allergic to each other. \n \n \nI know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n \n That's what they all say.\n \n \nIn 20 years in the Senate, Kerry authored I think 5 bills that passed...in 20 years!!\n\n \n That he personally authored, and it's more then that.\n http://www.factcheck.org/article282.html\n \n However, you are ignoring how Congress works, as well as how Senators work as well. Senator Kerry is the JUNIOR senator to Kennedy. Senior senators author thousands of bills, while the Junior sticks to cosponsoring bills that pass into law. Kennedy legislates like how bunny rabbits propagate. That is primarily what a Senior Senator DOES. \n \n I suggest you go here to see the number of bills Kerry has cosponsored. It rather lengthy. Every bill is consponsored by at least 1 other senator. To attack Kerrys record while ignoring basically how bills pass is not only ignorant, but deceitful. \n \n \nKerry voted against Reagon's SDI that helped end the Cold War (Cheney didn't).\n\n \n Did you even read the link? I should posting links to random stuff and see if people notice. It is quite clear you don't read the links. \n \n \nCheney voted against those weapons systems after the 1st Gulf War, Kerry voted against them before the 1st Gulf War.\n\n \n Wow, someone's got their dates screwed up. \n \n \nCheney Proposed Cutting F-16 Aircraft. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Cheney said, \"If you're going to have a smaller air force, you don't need as many F-16s...The F-16D we basically continue to buy and close it out because we're not going to have as big a force structure and we won't need as many F-16s.\" According to the Boston Globe, Bush's 1991 defense budget \"kill[ed] 81 programs for potential savings of $ 11.9 billion...Major weapons killed include[d]....the Air Force's F-16 airplane.\" [Cheney testimony, House Armed Services Committee, 2/7/91; Boston Globe, 2/5/91]\n \n Cheney Proposed Cuts to B-2 Program. According to the Boston Globe, in 1990, \"Defense Secretary Richard Cheney announced a cutback... of nearly 45 percent in the administration's B-2 Stealth bomber program, from 132 airplanes to 75...\" [Boston Globe, 4/27/90]\n \n Cheney Proposed Cutting AH-64 Apaches. In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee, Cheney said, \"This is just a list of some of the programs that I've recommended termination: the V-22 Osprey, the F-14D, the Army Helicopter Improvement Program, Phoenix missile, F-15E, the Apache helicopter, the M1 tank, et cetera.\" In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Cheney said, \"The Army, as I indicated in my earlier testimony, recommended to me that we keep a robust Apache helicopter program going forward, AH-64...I forced the Army to make choices...So I recommended that we cancel the AH-64 program two years out.\" [Cheney testimony, Senate Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee, 6/12/90; Cheney Testimony, House Armed Services Committee, 7/13/89, emphasis added] \n \n Cheney Proposed Cutting M-1 Abrams Tanks. In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee, Cheney said, \"This is just a list of some of the programs that I've recommended termination: the V-22 Osprey, the F-14D, the Army Helicopter Improvement Program, Phoenix missile, F-15E, the Apache helicopter, the M1 tank, et cetera.\" The Boston Globe reported on the impact of Cheney's cuts to armored tanks: \"The Army's cupboard is left particularly bare. Coming in the wake of last year's killing of the M-1 tank and the Apache helicopter, the death of the M-2 means the Army will soon have virtually no major weapons in production.\" [Cheney testimony, Senate Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee, 6/12/90; Boston Globe, 2/5/91] \n \n Cheney Proposed Cutting B-52 Bombers. In 1990, Cheney proposed cutting 14 B-52 bombers. Cheney also sought the retirement of two Navy battleships, two nuclear cruisers, and eight nuclear-powered attack submarines. In 1991, Cheney scrapped the Navy's A-12 Stealth attack plane, a fighter that was proclaimed to be a key part of the future of navy aviation in advanced stealth technology. [Newsday, 2/5/91; NY Times, 1/8/91; Boston Globe, 4/27/90; Boston Globe, 1/30/90]\n\n \n Oh wait, 1990 was BEFORE the gulf war! Therefore Cheney wanted to cut them BEFORE Gulf War, therefore making your asseration very, very, very, very wrong. Btw, you really should read the MSN link. It actually uses facts, which from looking at your argument, are either missing or very, very rare. \n \n \nKerry proposed a $6 billion intelligence cut in 1993, Cheney didn't. Kerry didn't attend a single intelligence meeting for a year after 9/11.\n \n \n Isn't that a bit hypocritcal to say? http://www.factcheck.org/article153.html\n You are basically attacking Kerry for what your own party did 66% more. And it was $1.5 billion, not the ridiculius $6 you give. Facts really are lost on your argument aren't they? He's NOT SUPPOSE TO ATTEND INTEL meetings after 9/11. Kerry left the committee in January 2001. How exactly was he suppose to attend meetings in a commitee he left months before 9/11? \n \n \n\n I haven't heard any of these issues brought up on any media, yet you can't find a channel that doesn't slam Bush every chance they get.\n\n \n Define slam, and criticize, since you failed to that as well. Well, Fox, but they aren't exactly.....the best news source. \n \n I still would like a answer to my sig.",
