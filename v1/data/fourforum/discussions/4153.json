   "Here is some more news from Iraq that you likely won't be seeing on Fox.\n \n http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/CE33285A-E068-4297-A83B-D6514150B0E3.htm\n \n This is a story about a couple of US soldiers who scragged a civilian interpeter. They are two of MANY us soldiers who are being charged with murdering Iraqi civilains. These are not the first two to be charged and found guilty. \n \n http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/C2DA549D-FB03-4E1A-85AF-BB0214727A24.htm\n \n This one is a story about Chalabi. Apparently the Iraqi interim government was planning to have him arrested for \"slandering the government\".\n \n \n\"We will arrest him and hand him to Interpol. He sought to tarnish (the image) of the defence ministry and the reputation of the defence minister,\" Shaalan told Aljazeera late on Friday. \n\n \n \nShaalan's comments put an unwanted spotlight on the financial dealings of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's government, raising questions about its conduct. \n \n Adding fuel to the fire, The New York Times reported that Allawi, Shaalan and a small circle of council members sent $300 million to a bank in Lebanon last week. \n \n \n Apparently there has been no warrant issued for his arrest as of yet, but I am not sure if this makes much of a difference or not, since the interm government has jailed over 100,000 people to date, and fewer than 1000 warrants have been issued.\n \n And finally......\n \n http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/BC15B4C7-B006-41BC-8EA6-D2E0CDFBD264.htm\n \n \nMeanwhile, candidates from smaller parties criticised the use of state media by members of the transitional government while smaller parties and independents have had little media access.\n \n Aziz al-Yassiri, the chairman of the Iraqi Democratic Trend, accused the members of the government of using their offices to create unfair advantages for themselves in the campaign.\n\n \n At least our tactics have not changed from the ones used in Afghanistan, where \"our guys\" were given virtually unlimited free time on television and radio stations, and opposition canidates were expected to pony up $150,000.00 for a 30 second spot. Gee, why would anybody question the legitimacy of these elections?\n \n Almost forgot this one:\n \n http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/7EC188FB-276D-43F4-800A-55B73E0A7617.htm\n \n Yep, it is true. The US has now calssified a news agancy as a terrorist threat. YES, they have advocated violence, but I think you would be hard pressed to say that have advocated violence any more than say, fox news, or any other news network who has been supportive of Bush and companies military actions which have killed far in excess of 100,000 people in the lasy couple of years. \n \n Personally, I don't like Al-Manar for the saem reason I don't like CNN or Fox news. Theay are obviously pushing an agenda. At the same time, to label them as a terrorist organinsation and ban them based soley on the fact that you don't like their message and ideaology is reprehensible, and if all those americans out there who calim to be patriots because they support such things actually gave a squat about the values that make America America, we would have already drug whoever made that decision up against a wall and shot them. \n \n Whoops.....better watch such talk. I would hate to be branded a \"terrorist organisation\".",

Would not enough food, water, and medical supplies help the Iraqis feel better about the US military presence. Would that not help cause the Iraqis stop supporting the insurgents?\n\n \n \n Gee, you think? The problem here is that despite the fact that rebuilding costs in Iraq are expected to be in excess of 100 billion dollars, we have thus far spent only about $500 million in real dollars. We are trying to pay for rebuilding using Iraqs oil, and the insurgents keep blowing up the pipelines. Since a major sticking point to Iraqis seems to be \"who is going to pay for all of this\", I think there is very definatly a connection here. It seems from some of the statements from insurgents that they are specifically blowing up the piplines so that the US cannot weasel its way out of footing the bill. \n \n This seems to be entirely lost on the American people, who keep hearing that the insurgents are blowing up the piplinse because they want to hurt the Iraqi people by making it impossible to pay for reconstruction. they miss the fact that Iraqi oil should have NOTHING AT ALL to do with reconstruction. We broke it, we are responsible for fixing it. End of story. For us to use Iraqi oil to rebuild the country is illegal, not that disregarding international law is anything new to the Bush administration.",

Your picture of what is going on presents none of that effort. I just added it for balance.\n\n \n What I am saying is that, while atrocities committed by US troops, corruption within the ranks of our appointed government, etc... arwe certainly negative marks against the US, our rebuilding efforts add nothing to the scale at all. You don't get any brownie points for helping somebody back to their feet after you hit them in the head with a hammer. \n \n \n \n...but the rape rooms, torture chanbers, mass killings of innocents and ither atrocities have ceased to exist. \n \n \n Or escalated. Teh highest number I have seen as far as the number of people murdered by saddam ins in the 300,000 range (285,000 if I rtemember correctly). Higher numbers include things like putting down internal insurrections and casualties form the Iran/Iraq war. So, 300,000 meaningless deaths so he could push his political agenda. 300,000 in 24 years. 12,500 per year. the current, accepted number of casualties from Bush pushing HIS political agenda is 100,000. We will say 50,000, though, so we don't have to debate the numbers. That is 25,000 meaningless deaths per year. I don't think we have any room to brag about mass killing ending. \n \n \nYour comparison leaves out the fact that Saddams brutality would have continued, as was evident in the fact that his sons were worse than he was.\n\n \n Except that his sons likely would have never ruled Iraq, since they were pretty unpopular (as opposed ot Saddam, who WAS fairly popular). It is VERY rare for a dictator to be suceeded by his son, since the sons of dictators tend to be kind of ignorant layabouts. Generally, when dear old dad dies, some enterprising general drags the kids out and executes them in the confusion that follows. \n \n \n \nIt was not illegal. Saddam may not have actually posed a threat but he convinced the world that he did. \n \n \n Can you provide me with a single quote from the Iraqis since gulf I that suggested they were trying to convince people that they still had WMDs? We could fill pages with all the statements made to the contrary. \n \n I think you would be hard pressed to back this statement up with anything at all. Now that even Bush has admitted to the fallacy of WMDs, is this going to be the new argument? That saddam tried to convince the world that he had WMDs despite the fact that the Iraqi government issued weekly protests to the UN regarding the trade sanctions, and every single one of them denied the existance of any WMDs?\n \n \nI don't know the entire story. I do know that presenting only the negative side is failing to tell the entire story. Claiming that a city has been leveled when photos show otherwise is embellishing the truth. Parts of the city appear to have been leveled or destroyed beyond use. Larger parts appear to be intact. The loss of infrastruture and basic utilities makes them uninhabitable for a time, but likely the city is can be rebuilt. \n \n \n All I can go by is the on the ground reports, since the Us militray has standing orders to shoot reporters who try to enter the city. I have yet to see a report that paints anything but a picture of near total destruction. If you have come across some, I might change my mind, but 20 meter, or even 5 meter sattelite photos don't \"clearly show\" anything at all. I have trouble assesing damage in photos that you have to work real hard to pick out semis (including digital enhancements).\n \n \n See above.\n \n \n \n That will largely depend on whether or not that are fixed.[/QUOTE][/QUOTE]",

   "http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GA12Ak02.html\n \n The following is an article of what is happening in Sadr City, the Shia dominated area of the poorest part of Bagdad.\n \n \nThe Sadrists have developed an effective political-military strategy aimed at converting Sadr City into a \"liberated area\", in the classic guerrilla warfare model. \n Their main military strategy is to expel the US from their domain; only when they are under attack themselves do they venture outside Sadr City to attack US bases or supply routes. \n The al-Sadr organization is attempting to construct a coherent \"dual\" government that replaces the central government and which administers the usual set of public services - from traffic control to apprehending street criminals - within limits set by their inability to coordinate with a national government. This proto-government has been particularly assiduous in addressing the number one problem of public order, street crime, and has actually cooperated with the local police in this campaign. \n Mehdi soldiers - the guerrilla forces led by the Sadrists - though prone to thuggery, are largely under the control of this dual government, which is led by civilians - tribal leaders and Muslim clerics. The Mehdi soldiers act as the police force within the community. \n The Sadrists have been surprisingly successful in co-opting the Iraqi police, by rewarding them for working on community issues and fighting them when they participate in efforts to suppress the rebel political-military structure. American military complaints about the unreliability of their Iraqi trainees is actually a reflection of successfully applied guerrilla policy. \n The Sadrists have begun to enforce strict Islamist fundamentalism by suppressing such \"moral crimes\" as liquor sales and prostitution. The have utilized an ugly brand of vigilantism (firebombing, assaults and even homicide) to remove moral criminals from the community. \n The Sadrists, and parallel groups in other cities (notably Fallujah), have publicly denounced the spectacular bombings perpetrated by various terrorists groups, complaining about their negative impact on the lives and livelihoods of Iraqi civilians and calling for an active alliance with the Iraqi police in suppressing foreign jihadis and domestic terrorists. \n The organization in Sadr City is an echo of similar developments in Sunni cities (with Fallujah as the center), and it may foreshadow similar developments in the all-important Shi'ite south. The American attacks on various Iraqi cities, including the brutal battle of Fallujah, was an attempt to reverse this trend toward self-governed cities into which American forces rarely intrude. \n \n",

   "Colateral damage and intended targets are two different things. \n\n \n Like when we intentionally drop bombs on civilian housing developments, killing 20 civilian non coms, in order to get 2 suspected terrorists? Or when we start at one end of a block and use satchel charges to blow holes through houses to get tot eh other end of the block, and kill several people in the houses along the way (people fooloish enough to not expect a shaped or satchel charge to go off right outside their home)?\n \n We are intentionally killing civilians to keep the number of US casualties low in order to keep the American public complacent. You don't find it a little unusual that even after we took control of the entire country, more civilians are being killed than US troops, whose supposed job is to be fighting? \n \n \n \n \nThat's the same weak argument I've heard from others. Think about the fact that when we bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki we killed about 200,000 per bomb...but it stopped the war. The bombs saved the lives of more people than they killed. The same applies to our contribution to the total death toll in Iraq. The mass killings, rape and torture have all but totally stopped. \n \n \n Several million were dying, sometimes several million per MONTH during WWII. that was certainly not the case in Iraq. The simple fact of the matter is, we are killing more innocent Iraqis than saddam ever did, and there is really no end in sight. We KNEW Nuking those cities would end the war. Thus far there is NOTHING in Iraq that looks like it will end the violence.\n \n We nuked Japan to end a war. Nothing we have done in Iraq has ended a war. We killed all those civilains for nothing.\n \n Nobody argues that we dropped those nukes to save the japanese people, because that would be an idiotic argument. We dropped those bombs to save americans and our allies. \n \n To now argue that we are killing all those Iraqis in order to save them is likewise idiotic. \n \n \nYeah right. Saddam was extremely popular when the citizenry was looking at the open end of a gun barrel and their families were being hauled off and killed. His sons had tremendous power and likely would have had all the generals killed as soon as they heard of the father's death. We both speculate here. \n \n \n Saddam WAS very popular int he Middle East. Nations \"friendly\" to the us such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are full of billionairs and people literally starving to death in the street. A few people own all the oil, and thus have all the money. Saddam was a socialist. The Iraqi people actually benifitted from Iraqs oil production. He wa sthe only leader in the ME that shgared anything at all with his people. Nobody starved to death in Iraq and nobody went homeless except by choice.\n \n True enough, saddam kept billions of dollars for himself. so do other Arab leaders. The difference is the other guys keep ALL the money fro themselves and give the people NOTHING, Saddam kept billions for himself and shared billions with the people. \n \n \n \nSaddam could have proved he had no WMDs. He chose not to. \n \n \n No, he couldn't. Originally, the inspection list contained about 100 locations. The UN weapons team inspected those, and declared Iraq WMD free. We added more locations to the list. They inspected THOSE, and declared them clean, and recommended an end to inspections. We added more to the list. They inspected THOSE, and declared them WMD free, and we added more to the list. Saddam got ****** and booted the inspectors out of the country not only because it had become ratehr obvious by that point that we were never going to let it go, but because by then there were more CIA, and mossad agents on the inspectors support staff than there were inspectors. Blix complained mroe than once that they were having trouble keeping up with the workload becuase his support staff was always off spying and not inspecting. \n \n At the end, the UN team asked for 2 more weeks. They were LITERALLY inspecting garden sheds and outhouses. Blix claimed that they had finally reached the point that Iraq could be declared WMD free, and nobody in the world could dispute it. 2 days later we were rolling into Iraq. \n \n \nIt does seem to be a dead horse...but where are the weapons that he once had?\n\n \n GONE, just like he said, just like the UN inspectors said. \n \n \nI'll wait 'til reporters are allowed in and a COMPLETE assessment is made of the damages before I accept that it was totally destroyed. I'm relatively certain that some portions of the city were completely destroyed but others have been untouched.\n\n \n Unless you can actually source something that suggests that (besides wide angle sat shots) it owuld seem that you are dismissing the observations of those actually there, on the ground,. including our own military, in favor of an entirely emotion driven and irrational.",

   "The Liberal US media is finally reporting, albit in a very small way, and if the Sadr City article by Atimes is correct, a biased way.\n \n \nOne tentative success story for the Americans has been Sadr City, the Shiite slum district on the capital's northeastern edge that is home to more than two million people. If election turnout is high anywhere in Baghdad, it is likely to be among the slum's dwellers, mostly followers of Moktada al-Sadr, the fiery Shiite cleric who twice last year mounted uprisings against American troops. \n \n After the battering his fighters took in August, Mr. Sadr agreed to a truce, and ordered his men to cooperate with a $160 million American reconstruction effort that employs 18,000 Sadr City residents and involves rebuilding sewers, water pipes, electricity lines and health clinics.\n \n But there remain wide swaths of the city where the insurgents, not the Americans or their Iraqi allies, appear to have the upper hand. The most threatening of these are predominantly Sunni districts like Adhamiya, where Mr. Hussein made his last stand as president, appearing on the hood of a car outside a mosque as American troops entered the city from the south\n\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/international/middleeast/27baghdad.html?pagewanted=2&th",

   "The scarred streets of Sadr City are more deprived than most in Baghdad, but yesterday residents were accorded a rare electoral treat - a candidate actually appearing in public to campaign. \n Fatah al-Sheikh, a Shia journalist turned politician and close ally of the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, risked precarious security to tour the slum in eastern Baghdad for several hours, thumping out anti-US rhetoric in a campaign foray that reminded Iraqis that elections are about more than posters on walls. \n \n Reaching out of a car, wrapped in an Iraqi flag, one arm high in the sky saluting people and the other holding a shroud, Mr Sheikh basked in local support for the revered cleric and made redistributive noises aptly tailored to the city's impoverished residents. \n \n But it was the mere fact of a candidate appearing in public that was most striking. \n \n In Baghdad, security is so hazardous that the only sign of Sunday's looming vote is the huge number of posters on walls. Campaigning has been practically impossible. Most candidates have resorted to leaflets and word of mouth, not daring to venture out in public; voters, already intimidated by the threat of violence at the polls, have been further distanced from the democratic process by the utter absence of candidates on the stump. \n \n snip\n \n In a slum where most of the people are unemployed and living conditions are among the worst in Baghdad, and where buildings are still pockmarked from the summer uprising against the Americans, it was not hard to predict the campaign platform. \n \n \"If by God's will I am elected I will work very hard for the poor people of Sadr City,\" he told a group of old men. \"Iraq is a very rich country; our oil should be used for building our cities instead of building Washington and New York. I will make sure that the Americans will be kicked out of the country.\" \n \n In every street he stopped to talk to the people. \"Oh, Um Mahdi,\" he cried as he held a black-veiled woman and kissed her forehead. \"Pray for me.\" The woman, an old neighbour, held her arms high. \"May God make you victorious,\" she said. \"God willing you will win and so you can change this miserable situation.\" \n \n \nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1399392,00.html",
