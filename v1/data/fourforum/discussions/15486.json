   "  D.C. Council poised to reject gun bill \n Since May, District residents have been unable to legally transfer a gun into the city because the only person licensed to transfer firearms into the city shut down his business. Fearing Congress will step in to rewrite the District&#8217;s gun laws if a gun shop doesn&#8217;t open soon, Council member Phil Mendelson (D-at Large) is sponsoring emergency legislation that would allow the District to enter the gun trade. \n \n &#8230; But during a Tuesday morning breakfast meeting it became clear the proposal is far short of the nine votes needed for passage. \n \n &#8220;It just seems like this is going to open the door to more gun dealers coming into the District,&#8221; said Council member Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), one of at least half-dozen members who expressed reservations about the proposal. \n Mendelson told his colleagues he introduced the measure to try to head off lawsuits and congressional intervention. \n \n &#8220;I don&#8217;t want Congress to have an excuse to legislate in this area because there is a chance we could lose,&#8221; Mendelson said.\n \n With the landmark 2008 Supreme Court decision that ended the District&#8217;s long-standing handgun ban, city residents are now allowed to purchase and own handguns so long as they are registered and kept in the home. Federal law prohibits residents from buying a handgun in another jurisdiction and bringing it into the city themselves. \n\n I think the proper comment, even Anti-gunners should be: Hey D.C.! OBEY THE LAW! \n \n   Color of Law \n U.S. law enforcement officers and other officials like judges, prosecutors, and security guards have been given tremendous power by local, state, and federal government agencies&#8212;authority they must have to enforce the law and ensure justice in our country. These powers include the authority to detain and arrest suspects, to search and seize property, to bring criminal charges, to make rulings in court, and to use deadly force in certain situations. \n \n Preventing abuse of this authority, however, is equally necessary to the health of our nation&#8217;s democracy. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a federal crime for anyone acting under &#8220;color of law&#8221; willfully to deprive or conspire to deprive a person of a right protected by the Constitution or U.S. law. &#8220;Color of law&#8221; simply means that the person is using authority given to him or her by a local, state, or federal government agency.\n",

In 1926 the United States Supreme Court upheld zoning as a right of U.S. states (typically via their cities and counties) to impose on landowners. The case was Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co. (often shortened to Euclid v. Ambler), 272 U.S. 365 (1926). The village had zoned an area of land held by Ambler Realty as a residential neighborhood. Ambler argued that it would lose money because if the land could be leased to industrial users it would have netted a great deal more money than as a residential area. Euclid won, and a precedent was set favorable to local enforcement of zoning laws.\n \n In doing so, the Court accepted the arguments of zoning defenders that it met two essential needs. First, zoning extended and improved on nuisance law in that it provided advance notice that certain types of uses were incompatible with other uses in a particular district. The second argument was that zoning was a necessary municipal-planning instrument.\n \n The Euclid case was a facial challenge, meaning that the entire scheme of regulation was argued to be unconstitutional under any set of circumstances. The United States Supreme Court justified the ordinance saying that a community may enact reasonable laws to keep the pig out of the parlor, even if pigs may not be prohibited from the entire community.\n \n Since the Euclid case, there have been no more facial challenges to the general scheme. By the late 1920s most of the nation had developed a set of zoning regulations that met the needs of the locality.\n \n Zoning in the United States - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

Only about 500 rifles and shotguns have been registered.  but be that as it may.\n \n Maybe because no one else wants to incur City Hall's wrath.

That is a complete denial of the Courts ruling. D.C. is throwing a temper tantrum, and Everyone know it.\n \n If I move to Dallas Texas, do I have to ship my firearms to an FFL or can I just take them to my new home. That is all Gura is saying. If you won't provide the place to ship them then at least remove the requirement that you can't take them to your new home, like everyone else other places in the U.S. enjoy.\n \n We see D.C., Chicago, and the government officials who ordered Gunwalker all flaunting common sense and the law to do whatever suits them, and or in this case, they have every intention to make people go to court to get every Constitutionally Recognized as protected right that they intend to enjoy. Especially if it has anything to do with the 2nd Amendment.

Here is what the legal experts say and a probably new court case for you to ponder and wrap that monkey mind around:\n \n \nPosted by Ilya Shapiro\n That's the upshot of a recent decision by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Ezell v. City of Chicago. This was a challenge to the new regulations the city enacted in the wake of McDonald v. City of Chicago case, which applied the Second Amendment to the states. \n In an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's clear holding, Chicago's ordinance first mandates that would-be gun owners receive training at a firing range but then prohibits firing ranges from operating in the city. The court, in a striking opinion by Judge Diane Sykes (put her on your Supreme Court shortlist for the next Republican administration), tells the city to go back to the drawing board.\n I won't go into the details, but the court applied intermediate scrutiny and found that Chicago has not presented anything approaching a compelling reason for its restriction. Here's an analysis of the opinion by Josh Blackman and some follow-up commentary from Cato associate policy analyst Dave Kopel.\n Gratifyingly, Judge Sykes cites the Pandora's Box article that Josh and I published early last year in the run-up to the McDonald argument (see footnote 11 on page 31). It's quite an honor to appear in the same footnote as Randy Barnett, Steven Calabresi, Brannon Denning, Glenn Harlan Reynolds (the Instapundit), and many other noted scholars - including Akhil Amar, who in the wake of our Obamacare debate and bet may not appreciate it as much.\n Congratulations to the intrepid Alan Gura (who also litigated McDonald and Heller v.

Perhaps you need to backthread and read a couple or three court cases which have been posted...a lot.\n \n HS and Janet Napilatano are neck deep is SMUGGLING GUNS TO CARTELS and you suggest she and her dept. of hypocrisy and insecurity has congressional powers to make law? That is Congress job under Article 1, section 8 and the SCOTUS already determined the legitimacy and incorporated the RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS to the States and local governments. \n \n If you had any knowledge whatsoever, you would know D.C. is controlled by Congress and not a pseudo agency like HS that attempted to cover up the Avila shooting and others by gun smuggling signed off on by them. You really don't keep up at all do you?\n \n That RIGHT is an individual, fundamental right incorporated in McDonald into the 14th Amendment.\n \n You have any other shocking revelations of innacuracy to share with the board and try to redo what is binding law both on the Feds and the States?\n \n It applies especially against the federal government and States.\n \n NEXT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

   "Uh Yeah. It seems you forgot part. \n \n   Critics take aim at new D.C. handgun legislation\n \n You are on the wrong side of this one. They are scamming the Constitution and flaunting the law. The Color of Law excerpt that I posted should be made to apply to them!\n\n \n It is about trying to diminish a right through zoning. The first case I know of was Moore v. East Cleveland and SCOTUS ruled that the fundamental rights are not to be \"pricked [sic] out in the terms of fundamental rights and mentioned the right to keep and bear arms\" as was done previously in Poe v. Ulmann. Doesn't look like the court has been eager to try to control rights through zoning?",

Worth attempt to use the fire code and zoning to shut down their business. The State Supreme court ruled it was unConstitutional.\n \n I listed two other SCOTUS cases yesterday that are worth the read. Funny thing is, the liberals now oppose the 2A on 14A grounds also. Next thing surely will be a resurgence in poll tax and attacks on all civil rights. emoticon_xgood",
