   "The POINT here is Hearing Voices.\n Which IS a sign of mental illness. Psychosis.\n\n \n To that I make several points ...\n How many religious people do you think audibly hear voices when no one is around??? And again, why are we not to consider the possibility here that it may be a sign of psychosis INDEPENDENT of them being religious??? If it's psychosis, it's psychosis--not religion. The problem here is that you're intentionally conflating these two things when they don't need to be conflated. People can be psychotic, religious or not, and there are plenty of religious people who don't act psychotic.I also wonder if you may be confusing the religious concept of hearing the voice of God in the sense of getting inspiration from God via the Bible or preaching and so forth, with belief they are hearing actual sound. I realize there are people out there who have said they actually have heard the voice of God audibly, but in the scheme of Christendom at large, I suspect this is not very common, if not rare. But when most religious people (that I've ever know of) say things like \"God told me to go to so-and-so\" or \"to do so-and-so\" they're not necessarily saying they heard an auditory SOUND.Another problem with your take on this is that it also doesn't take into account cases where there really was a voice (someone talking) nearby that could have been interpreted as the voice of God--which wouldn't be 'psychosis' at all, rather misunderstanding of where the voice was coming from. I've heard of cases where people think they heard something, assumed it was God, but in reality it was someone talking nearby or something. The same thing happens all the time when people attribute natural sounds to supernatural things--the haunted-house phenomenon, for instance, with it's creaky floors and walls. Next thing you know, every lens glare spot of light showing up on a photograph taken in such house is thought to be a spirit or ghost.\n \nIf you are exagerating a 'feeling' into 'hearing' then you could fall into the classification of a neurosis. Perpetual exagerations such as this to justify something is a sign of mental illness. More so if you don't know you're doing it.\n Scaregoating is an aspect of narccasism.\n Then there's the good old 'delusions of grandeur'. \n\n \n Again, when religion shows up as a heading in DSM IV, come back and try again. Yours, Trebor's, and Samiinh's view just doesn't jibe with the the views of the mental health community, who often even view religion as a GOOD thing if it helps people cope with problems, tragedy, or helps provides stability to their lives. Religion is like anything else--it can be taken too far, and symptoms of mental problems can show up in peoples' religious activities and statements (which is probably what's really happening). The real issue here is that psychosis can happen, religious or not. Just as symptoms can show up in the activities of NON-religious people. Where we need to be careful is to not to conflate religion and insanity. People who do so by saying \"religion is a form of insanity\" or feel that religious people are delusional or psychotic are usually speaking out of prejudice. They often don't realise it because anti-religious prejudice is one of the last socially-acceptable form of prejudice there is. And frankly, anti-religious prejudice that spawns such threads that conflate religion and mental illness are of greater concern to me than this tripe.",

   "To that I make several points ...\n How many religious people do you think audibly hear voices when no one is around??? And again, why are we not to consider the possibility here that it may be a sign of psychosis INDEPENDENT of them being religious??? If it's psychosis, it's psychosis--not religion. The problem here is that you're intentionally conflating these two things when they don't need to be conflated. People can be psychotic, religious or not, and there are plenty of religious people who don't act psychotic.\n\n \n To be honest, very few. I'd also suggest that many of those who make such claims are lying. Typically a pastor who wants to impress his congregation with how 'spiritually connected' he is to God.\n Still, actually hearing voices is a mental condition.\n \n \nI also wonder if you may be confusing the religious concept of hearing the voice of God in the sense of getting inspiration from God via the Bible or preaching and so forth, with belief they are hearing actual sound. I realize there are people out there who have said they actually have heard the voice of God audibly, but in the scheme of Christendom at large, I suspect this is not very common, if not rare. But when most religious people (that I've ever know of) say things like \"God told me to go to so-and-so\" or \"to do so-and-so\" they're not necessarily saying they heard an auditory SOUND.\n\n This would fall into the exagration claim I made.\n To the point that you may want something to be true so much, you just go with your own feelings and push that off onto something external.\n Such as temptation to do something being from the 'devil' or a desire to help others being put into you by God.\n Such issues can be a symptom of a neurotic. \n \n \nAnother problem with your take on this is that it also doesn't take into account cases where there really was a voice (someone talking) nearby that could have been interpreted as the voice of God--which wouldn't be 'psychosis' at all, rather misunderstanding of where the voice was coming from. I've heard of cases where people think they heard something, assumed it was God, but in reality it was someone talking nearby or something. The same thing happens all the time when people attribute natural sounds to supernatural things--the haunted-house phenomenon, for instance, with it's creaky floors and walls. Next thing you know, every lens glare spot of light showing up on a photograph taken in such house is thought to be a spirit or ghost.\n\n Misinterpreting a voice heard that actually existed from someone nearby would be a sign of a very naieve person or someone suffering from a mental condition (such as stress *). Rather than seeking a sound reason on why the voice is heard they come to really odd conclusion.\n \n *Just recently, someone mentioned the Gas Light effect as a psychological term. I've only found some slight references to it.\n Basically, it's named after a 1950's movie of the same name where a woman's husband is seeking to make her think she's crazy by pulling all sorts of underhanded tricks.\n Either she's crazy or 'they're out to get her'.\n If no one's really out to get you, you're just paranoid...also a psychotic (but somewhat common) symptom.\n In the case of the person who mentioned this to me.\n She's neurotic at the least and paranoid as no one is after her.\n \n \n \nAgain, when religion shows up as a heading in DSM IV, come back and try again. Yours, Trebor's, and Samiinh's view just doesn't jibe with the the views of the mental health community, who often even view religion as a GOOD thing if it helps people cope with problems, tragedy, or helps provides stability to their lives. Religion is like anything else--it can be taken too far, and symptoms of mental problems can show up in peoples' religious activities and statements (which is probably what's really happening). The real issue here is that psychosis can happen, religious or not. Just as symptoms can show up in the activities of NON-religious people. Where we need to be careful is to not to conflate religion and insanity. People who do so by saying \"religion is a form of insanity\" or feel that religious people are delusional or psychotic are usually speaking out of prejudice. They often don't realise it because anti-religious prejudice is one of the last socially-acceptable form of prejudice there is. And frankly, anti-religious prejudice that spawns such threads that conflate religion and mental illness are of greater concern to me than this tripe.\n\n Religion has someone believing something exists when there is no evidence (beyond your own internal feelings) for it.\n This is a sign of mental illness.\n Thus, it would seem that religion fosters mental illness.\n Religion often rewards and exhaults those who suffer from symptoms of mental illness (such as those who 'hear voices').\n Religion has a tendency to destroy one's self defense ability from being exploitated and abused as witnessed in this case and in the case of others.\n A form of conditioning.\n Conditioning is a psychological term.\n \n Delusions of grandeur can be fostered in the participants. We can see that in some of those here.\n \n \n So, the big hairs to split are whether crazy people are more common in a religious setting and if so, is it because they are \n a) drawn to it for some reason (such as it fulfilling one of their delusions) \n b) they are made in it. Through varying degrees of manipulation, they are forced into a state of psychosis (like trying to belive in a double bind that's presented or follow something that's illogical) \n c) ?other?\n \n \n \nWell in that case they're being dishonest. If you have interpreted scripture to arrive at a conclusion then why not say \"I believe this is what God wants me to do\". That's a world away from \"God told me to...\" in terms of certainty.\n\n I believed I addressed this.\n Someone who interprets an inner feeling as comething from an external source could be neurotic or even psychotic.\n \"I have a desire to help this person on the streets who's hurting. Why? I guess it must be an invisible external source that placed such feelings inside me.\"\n Would be a sign of mental illness. As you're stating something put that feeling there. (There are biblical passages that back this up).\n Reading a memo from someone else and trying to follow it for some reason (seeking reward or avoiding some punishment) probably wouldn't be.\n \n While I know I'm not the world and my experiences are my own, I've found too many religious people who fall into the former category. I'm sure the experiences of others differ and support the latter.",

Then, of course, there's the one other possibility (which you no doubt do not accept as a possibility) that God may indeed HAVE spoken audibly to a few folks at times in history. As one who believes in God, I'm not going to arbitrarily take that possibility off the table. Though no doubt it would have to be rare because of how few people have ever claimed to have such an experience.\n \n \nReligion has someone believing something exists when there is no evidence (beyond your own internal feelings) for it.\n This is a sign of mental illness.\n\n \n That's faith, essentially. So basically, faith of any kind is a sign of mental illness in your view? I think most would disagree with you, and for good cause. Faith is a pretty normal part of life for many people. It's not an illness.

   "Sure they were brutal, but they didn't bury their heads in the sand. I'm sure Greeks had their own problems, as we still do now. However, as quickly as science and math and etc.. were advancing, I believe that before too much time had passed they would have reached their own 'enlightenment' instead of 1700 years later. I mean in sheer scale, I don't think the Romans held a candle to the Inquisition and the burning of witches and heretics. But either way, scientific and intellectual advances often lead to an enlightenment in society which the Church was able to quash for a long time... Religion is a waste of time and manpower and can be a dangerous weapon when used as a fist!\n\n \n With all due respect CxT, I'm sure you would agree that we now personally live in the most enlightened time in all of history. Yet, are you aware of the brutality, torture, mass murders and genocide's taking place in various Countries around the World as we speak? China, our largest trading partner and host of the Summer Olympics has one of the worst human rights records on Earth; today, as we speak. Look at Sudan, Chad, Saudi Arabia where they still cut off the heads of criminals with swords at noon in the public square. Look at Chechnya, and let's not even go to Africa where mass murder and the total annihilation of complete villages due to political instability and upheavals is the norm. \n \n Now if you truly studied who the propagators of these crimes are today, you would find that in the case of the Asian Countries, most of whom citizens have no human or civil rights at all, the Governments are either Atheistic as China is, Hindu, Buddhist, or Islamic and many of the victims are christians. In Africa the Moslems are wiping out the Christians. But you can find no christian Nation on Earth that is committing Genocide against any minority within their population.",

   "I think that's a fairly fair assessment, AA. I'd have to say that the Christians are behaving themselves (most of them, ie. Westboro Baptist Church & etc.) after a long history of not so nice behavior. Again, it would be silly and incorrect to attempt to lay ALL of mans problems on religion. Not even close. There are differences in race and economics that lead to the wars. Rampant nationalism is probably the worst (numbers wise anyway). Really, most of the problems start when people begin to get away from logic and into extreme fanaticism, religious or otherwise. When people take themselves too seriously, not seriously enough, or when they reject common sense and basic principals in favor of extremism is when we run into issues that have ill consequences for mankind.",

   "Exactly! \n Furthermore, imagine if we could have built on the knowledge of Greece and Rome instead of having 2000 years of darkness thanks to the Catholic church. What if all the man/hours and money and etc... people waste on superstitious blather like church and religion were actually used in pursuit of something worth while? WOW! Not to mention the waist of humanity that goes into the battles between religions, just one more thing to undermine the efficiency of human endeavors.\n\n \n I'm pretty sure it was the godless heathen barbarians that caused the dark ages and Catholicism assisted in saving some of the 'light' through scribes and preservation efforts.\n Of course, people in power with personal agendas and a deire to preserve and enhance that power (be they religious leaders or otherwise) led to the darker aspects of the Church.\n \n \n \n I think that religious/spiritual inclinations are an aspect of being human. Hardwired into us possibly.\n Many have it. Some don't.\n Thus, you'll see people who cling tightly to their beliefs or, when those they are born and raised into don't click for them, rather than doing the seemingly rational thing and abandoning them altogether, they convert to another system.\n And you'll also see other humans born without this inate aspect and lead a happy and content life of atheism or be unhappy with any religion if atheism is never stumbled upon. \n \n So, while I'd personally like people to give up the 'nonsense' I see it as being along the lines of pushing communism or anarchism or other extemist belief that looks good on paper...but doesn't work unless humans stop being human.\n \n I think my starting this thread has more to do with exasperation as the abuse that goes on in these systems when checks and balances aren't working or don't exist.\n COGIC is like a mini-catholic system. And as witnessed with the RCC sex scandals, the hierchy had a tendency to hide and deny th problems.\n You also have fanatically blind followers who live in denial plus what happens in many abuse and scam cases. The victim is just too embarrased or in denial to come forward. It's what happens when a person is a position of power over you is allowed a free hand when they abuse.\n And while many can armchair it away with an attitude of 'well, it voluntary so if you don't like the abuse you can simply walk away. No one's keeping you there at that church.' the real aspects of this kind of abuse runs a lot deeper.\n \n \n I still believe the vast majority of people who thing (a) god is speaking to them are lying (to themselves and others) or juxtaposing their own desires onto an external source or are certifiably psychotic.\n \n \n \n \n @AA,\n You forgot the Orthodox Christian Serbs...\n But, that was a handful of years back.\n \n Oh, and let's not forget Liberia.\n Some sweet slaughter there at the hands of self-professed Christians.",

A sane person would likely not have done that, religious or not, and insanity far better explains why she would do something like that than does religion.\n\n \n so the issue of the motive behind the action is the person's sanity, not their claim that god told them to do it. as electrolyte rightly said, if people who claim god told them to do something bad are all insane, but people who claim god told them to do something good are sane, then its either god specifically handpicks insane people to commit crimes and selects sane people to do his good deeds, or its simply that insane people tend to do crimes and sane people do good deeds and god has nothing to do with it\n \n if i do a good deed without claiming god told me to do it, can you verify whether god actually told me to do it or not? and if i do the exact good deed and say it was god's idea, can you verify whether i'm lying about hearing from god or not? and vice versa with bad deeds. and vice versa with your claims about the motives of your deeds, whether good or bad. why does it matter in any event whether the doer of the deed claims he was motivated by the voice of god? is obeying whatever you think god told you to do more important than the deed itself?",

I, along with many people like the spice of life that faith helps to bring, and that's not going to change. You can no more eradicate faith than you could perform mind control on people. I like the fact that religious charities help people all over the world. I like the idea of a world where God loves people, and wants us to help them.

And a congregant who's gone there long enough will often know in advance when they're due.

   "Sorry.\n \n For you and Jyoshua\n \n It's the WHY you do something that defines whether you're rational or irrational (and possibly delusional and insane. \n NOT the WHAT you do.\n\n \n Then it's a pointless issue. If people do good things because they think God wants them to, or because they think God told them to, then it's ridiculous to have the idea we should oppose that. If they do bad things, THEN we oppose that. It may be that rational and irrational are determined internally by the WHY in the theoretical sense, but all that really MATTERS is the WHAT, in any practical sense. Otherwise you're going to be in the business of telling religious people they don't need to feed starving people, and I don't think you really want to be in that position. The best approach is simply to oppose people when they do BAD things, and support them when they do GOOD things, and stop worrying so much about whether it comes out of a belief system or not. That's the only reasonable real-world approach one can take.\n \n \nHate to burst your bubble but 'mind control' is an accepted fact. Unless you're pushing the issue of telepathic puppet-control.\n\n \n My point was simply that the idea of getting people to abandon faith is so pointless and impossible, one would have to resort to mind-control to do it. People LIKE having faith. And this idea that it's bad is, itself, bad. We need to stop this intolerant idea about people of faith. The only decent approach is to get back to being willing to work with religious people and accept that they are a part of life, rather than condescend to them. They aren't going away--you might as well accept them. Religion helps bring about a lot of good in the world, and the best approach is to oppose the bad and support the good.

   "?? Excuse me?? So you don't think the people in that article were isolated screwballs???? Seriously. Do you ACTUALLY think the behavior described in that article is COMMON in churches??? emoticon_frazzled Why on earth should we NOT deflect the behavior you just described onto isolated screwballs??? \n \n \n Look, let's cut to the bottom line here: you're taking this example and assuming it means a faith-based belief system is automatically bad. You've seen this article, and it reinforces your pre-concieved notions about faith and religious people, even though these actions described by this group are by all accounts COMPLETELY isolated behaviors. Never mind the cases where faith has led to good things. Never mind the fact that most churches in the world simply go about their business leaving you alone. Your approach is irrational. Where people do bad things, they should be opposed. Where they aren't or are doing good things, they shouldn't be opposed. It's just not that complicated, really.\n \n \n \n So I guess it's right up your alley that Stalin killed people, since he was an atheist. See, the idea that God speaks to someone and the actions of this pastor and his parishioners are two distinct issues. You're muddying the waters here (intentionally, I suspect). The only thing that would be \"right up my alley\" that these people probably believed is that there is a god and that he is capable of speaking to someone if He wants. Doesn't mean He DID in that case, or that they got the right message. But of course, even though it's likely a completely isolated case, you're going to use this isolated case to condemn ALL faith rather than just where faith goes bad. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n Nah, you just apparently think all faith is bad even if it ultimately results in people's lives getting saved or other good things happening. \n \n \n \n The point is that YOU seem to think religious people need faith to do good. Otherwise you wouldn't have likely brought that up.\n\n \n 1. Pastor abuse is way common. However, even if this was an isolated circumstance, it is the trust that Spanky was hearing from god that was instumental in this problem.\n 2. You have resorted to telling me what I really think and what I am really trying to say. Please don't tell me my assumptions.\n 3. It appears Godwin's law extends to Stalin if there is an athiest in the room. \n 4. See Zardoz's last post.

It presupposes that one has made the judgment that God is indeed speaking to someone, which is a pretty major deal. But I would always be suspect about preachers saying they had heard directly from God, as any \"good protestant\" would. I think this is one hallmark of protestantism--suspicion of anyone claiming some direct revelation from God. This very issue is one reason why sola scriptura is a big deal in protestantism.

While not many have the attitude of 'convert or starve' it's sometimes implied. It also elevates one religion over others. The religion of the haves vs that of the have nots.

   "As in people in 3rd world 'over-populated' countries that doesn't have the ecological resources to support their numbers?\n \n Yes! Those are specifically the ones who should be allowed to starve to death.\n It's natures way of culling people.\n All humans do is mess up the way nature works. \n The only thing humans should do is what other animals in such a situation would do. Expand their territory, cull their own population numbers or starve until the resources are enough to support the remaining numbers.\n \n There are little to no good results that come out of allowing 'christians' to help such people.\n\n \n It may be that there's over-population without good distribution and ecological resources in these countries, but they are still human beings. The answer isn't to intentionally let them starve to death and stop helping them--it's to fix the resource problems. With all due respect, your approach sounds more like you're dealing with a herd of cattle than real people.\n \n \nThe rational response is that doing so gains us browning (good will) points.\n Such points aren't worth anything tangible.\n In feeding such, they become dependent upon the charity and don't address their problems.\n\n \n That's an excuse not to help sometimes, for sure. But if people need help, they need help. If they don't have the option to help themselves, then they're not going to be able to do it.\n \n \nOften, those doing this charity are doing so out of an evangelical mission and seek to convert. While not many have the attitude of 'convert or starve' it's sometimes implied. It also elevates one religion over others. The religion of the haves vs that of the have nots.\n\n \n Who cares about the other religions, when peoples' lives are at stake and need aid?? If other religions want to step up and provide aid then let them. And sorry, but in the world at large, no mainstream religion is a \"have not.\" There are plenty enough rich Islamics (as well as members of Judaism) to match (or possibly supercede) Christianity's humanitarianism if they wanted to. In fact, that's a great idea: a jihad of humanitarianism! A war between religions of aid to the needy in the world.\n \n Are you seriously presenting these points as reasons not to help people? Implications of conversion? The effect of elevating one religion over another? You mentioned you were an atheist earlier, so I don't understand why you'd CARE that one religion be elevated over another--wouldn't they ALL be bunk to you, anyway? \n \n \nSimply because Christianity is dominant in an exploitive western world it comes off as superior to the ones whose environment isn't as wealthy or exploitive. Being able to say 'Look what Christianity does...and XXX religion doens't'.\n This fosters animosity and resentment amongst the faiths involved.\n You're pushing a 'white mans' burden attitude with a religious apporach.\n\n \n So, in your view we should stop sending doctors to 3rd world countries? Stop going on humanitarian missions and stop teaching them to grow crops, and stop providing food in famine-poverished regions? Stop providing AIDS education, as well as contraceptives? All because of this concern that there might be some animosity between religions??? Sorry, but that animosity will just have to be there.\n \n \nWhen you invade a different culture with your own via it's attachments to aid, you alter the culture. Until all those little impoverished people are existing off of your cast offs and garbage. How many 3rd worlders do you see wearing cheap western logoed clothing?\n\n \n Well, the alternative is simply them often starving to death or dying very early of sickness. If wearing a \"cheap western logoed\" shirt is the price to pay for that, so be it.\n \n \nIt's irrational to send resources a long way away when they are useful and needed right here. Charity begins at home. It also cost more resources to do so.\n\n \n Have you ever been to a 3rd world country? I don't ask to sound condescending; I'm simply asking. There is really no reason anyone in the U.S. HAS to be truly without shelter and starving to death. There's always a shelter somewhere, churches somewhere, always a food pantry somewhere, etc. It may require some walking to get there, but they are there, nonetheless, in every city. Heck, a beggar here can actually eek out a living with a sign at a stoplight. That's not the case in many places in the 3rd world. What we consider poor here is luxury there. What you think of here as needing charity is a life that many people THERE would love to HAVE because it would mean at least the guarantee of some food in their stomach on a regular basis.\n \n With that said, given that you're putting forth the argument charity should be done here instead of there, does that mean your view that Christian charity shouldn't be done isn't a view that applies to domestic charities? You're fine with churches and Christians giving aid to the poor and needy as long as they are within western borders?? \n \n \nWhen roles are reversed...do we receive any significant assistance?\n If no, then the rationality of 'scratching each others backs' doesn't exist.\n\n \n Well the reality is that the need there is far greater than it is here--by an astronomical factor. But you're talking about an agreement, not charity. There's already a system that's been around for eons that involves getting for what we give: it's called trade and commerce. Charity is a different thing.\n \n \nTell ya what.\n Send some of your charity to my paypal acct. and it'll earn you good brownie points.\n You'll be taking care of someone just as deserving as the faceless and nameless person on the other side of the world.\n\n \n Perhaps as deserving, but probably not nearly as needy. Unless you're truly in danger of, or on the verge of starving to death.",
