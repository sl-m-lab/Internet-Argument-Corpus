   "Series of explosions on gas pipeline linking Russia and Georgia are of Tbilisi make IMO! Georgian reporters got to the place so quickly that I got the impression they had been waiting in the nearby bushes to appear in due moment! And Saakashvili reaction is too well thought to be spontaneous! The whole thing was definitely well-planed by Saakashvili. I fear this is not the worst thing maniac Saakashvili is ready to do to stay at power! \n And imo USA is no stranger to it. \n Saakashvili's benefits are evident. Firstly, with his popularity surely go down wily Mikie needs badly an outward enemy. In this case it's Russia. Actually, it's an old political trick. Mikie gets good enough chance to show himself off as a real macho defending his people so bravely. By putting the blame on Russians he is trying to portray them as absolute evil in the eyes of ordinary Georgians still treating Russians in a friendly way. Needless to say this is also the blow on Georgia opposition focusing on good ties with Russia.\n Secondly, it was America, which put him into the presidential chair. It is America which can help him stay in it. I mean those blasts fit very well America's present campaign to weaken Europe by scaring it with the 'Russians' political energy weapon' (as Condy Rice put it) and destroying its emerging partnership with Russia in energy sphere. Yuschenko with his gas theft was the first stage of the plan. Saakashvili goes second. \n So poor Ukrainians and Georgians are braving the cold due to this American scheme, I guess. They are pawns on the grand chess-board.",
