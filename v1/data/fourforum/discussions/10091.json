She could have had a brief case to match her attire that she clutched taking up room.\n \n There are several factors to consider. And without further information, what are we to do? Consider your 'observations' to be true. As I said, they could be. I was just pointing out a highly viable alternative...because I'm known for thinking out side of the box.\n As with Symbiot, my thoughts come from simple decades of observations and personal experience. The testing I've read about is of the sort you just happen to be exposed to while growing up...you know, the droning news anchor type who mentions 'blah blah blah' that happens to stick in my memory...because I have a pretty good memory.\n \n And while racism does continue to exist, so does classism.\n Only, people complain more about superficial things like color rather than how people of differing classes interact.\n If we tried to adress classism...well, we'd be accused of Communism.\n \n \n A related question would be, who sat next to you?\n \n A more apt title to this thread would be Blatant Discrimination.",

I noticed that she was one of the only people who had nobody sitting by her where as the rest of the bus was almost full. I began to notice that as people boarded the bus that there was a hesitation in their thought process before deciding where to sit. A pregnant latina woman got on, glanced at the black woman with the empty seat, almost sat down but decided instead to sit next to a pock-marked white man. After her came a latino man, who also almost sat down beside her but decided to move on after feverishly glancing around. \n \n I could see the tension in this womans shoulders every time this happened, I'm sure she is used to it by now.
