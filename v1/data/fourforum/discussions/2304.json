   "The Conservative Neocons in the Bush Administration promoted the military invasion and occupation of Iraq as part of War on Terror. Defying the international community the United States military took over Iraq with no real finial plan and strategy of peace. The Conservative Neocons manipulated the facts to build their case on the military invasion of Iraq. It was described as a ?Cake Walk? and that our troops were going to be received as those in Europe during World War II. The Bush Conservative Neocons are in the pockets of the military industrial complex, the oil industry and the State of Israel. \n \n For over twelve years the United States and Great Britain bombed Iraq and enforced trade sanctions that had more of a devastating effect on the Iraqi people than Saddam. Twelve years before the 1991 War with Iraq we were supplying Saddam with chemical weapons for his War with Iran. The United States and Great Britain were instrumental in the creation of the Saddam and the Shaw of Iran regime. Many of the people in the Middle East have gotten the short end of the stick by their government and the United States government policies. \n \n Today we are paying the price for many years of bad United States policies in the Middle East. We are on the wrong track going the wrong way and do not even know it. President Bush said ?They hate us because of our Freedom? when in reality they hate our foreign policies and what it is doing to their nations. From a tyrannical regime to a society of chaos being occupied by foreign armies the Iraqi people have been the victims. The internal problems of Iraq have to be solved by the Iraqi people with as little interference as possible from outside world. For people of one nation to tell another people of another nation how to run their country is similar to one family telling another family how to raise their children.\n \n The Conservative Neocons tunnel vision to how the world should be is very self-serving. The half-truths they tell to meet and maintain their goal is daunting and is terrorizing the people of the world. Many of the talking heads in the mass media are the lips of the people in power to disseminate miss-information to hide the ugly truth. Our going to war in Iraq and current occupation of Iraq is a good example. The United States government undermined the United Nations as an organization before the invasion of Iraq and now we want to turn the Iraqi mess that we created over to them. You do not wreak a country and destroy their system in one hundred days and then expect to re-build it to meet your standards. \n \n Today millions of Iraqi people are out of work with foreign contractors doing much of the work in their county. The American military forces have taken over many of Saddam?s former palaces creating ?Green Zones?. What the Conservative Neocons call an International Coalition is mostly American military and British military forces with there being more soldiers of fortune (missionaries) than British forces. With more high paying security jobs being created in Iraq 500 to 1500 dollars a day paid for by the American taxpayer and more low paying security jobs being created in America. The Conservative Neocons through fear and deception have manipulated the American people into believing we are doing right. With one mistake after another we are only making a bad situation worst. Our government officials and Conservative Neocons are trying to tell the Iraqi people the answers to their problems and many of the Iraqi people do not agree. We are not listening or even told what they are saying if it challenges our official position.",

   " The Bush Conservative Neocons are in the pockets of the military industrial complex, the oil industry and the State of Israel. \n\n \n I don't understand why we invaded Iraq instead of Iran. Most of the terrorists from Afghanistan ran into Pakistan and Iran, NOT Iraq. Iran is more militant, and already poses WMD and is close to developing Nukes. \n \n My only explanation is because it was planned back in 1998 by PNAC (PNAC was formed by Cheney and others in the White House). Maybe Iraq was just an easy target compared to Iran, I don't know. That would make us a bully though.\n \n \n Today we are paying the price for many years of bad United States policies in the Middle East.

   "Israel pulling out of the Gaza Strip is a step in the right direction towards a long-term peace settlement. This is only a beginning in the creation of a viable Palestinian State. Gaza Strip population is over 1,274,000 people in 360 square miles making it one of the most density-populated areas in the world with over 3,500 people per square miles. Very little fresh water and an ailing infrastructure and economy in the Gaza Strip, there is much that has to be done. The standard of living of the Palestinian people will have to be comparable to the Israelis and Jordanian. A major long-term international financial program is needed for the Gaza Strip. \n \n Egypt the recipient of a lot of international financial aid can help greatly in the creation of a viable Palestinian State. Egypt a nation that is cash poor and rich in land and culture could help in three ways. The first part only the Egyptians could help the Palestinian people with a land deal. A land deal with Egypt for a portion of the Sinai Peninsula bordering the Gaza Strip should be granted to the Palestinian State. This land deal could be the carrots that make the Gaza Strip a prosperous and viable state. The second major contribution Egypt can make is to work with the rest of the international community in the construction of the infrastructure to the Gaza Strip. The third Egypt could be one of the larger trading partners as well as on the ground consultants to the Palestinian people. \n \n The Israeli settlements in Gaza that the Israeli government is going to turn over to the Palestinian people should be intact as part of the reparation. Some of the former Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip should be used for housing the international humanitarian worker. Building a world-class hotel somewhere in Gaza so that international business has a base to work from to attract international investment into Gaza.",

Geez, read a history book, they're not that expensive.\n \n And because Kim Jong is the threat that he is, is the precise reason behind why we are taking such precaution in that area. If we went in there like we did in Iraq (I say we because this is a national effort if some of you have forgotten), the people who are already foaming at the mouth with hatred for Bush would just have something else to say, stating he wanted the world to end or something just as insane and pathetic. When you're dealing with nukes, especially a leader who is ready and willing to use them, then you don't rush in guns blazing like Iraq. It's no secret that Iraq was slanted heavily in our favor, but N. Korea, that's another story altogether. Don't be so willing to believe there are no negotiations going on as we speak. Unless of course that is you think you're important enough to know every single detail of the country's workings. And also, don't give your full faith to a statement that might very well be a bluff. You have to take it all into consideration.",

Current technology enabling mass media just speeded things up. The simple fact is that if put into terms of patriotism, most populations will do the bidding of their leaders regardless of any consequences. General society, like sheep and other herd animals, finds safety in conformity. If their shepard says do this, they do this. The crook or dog is always there for strays. You can run them off a cliff and those few who might resist are carried along by the herd.\n \n You'd think, after Vietnam and Russia's sojourn in Afghanistan, that we should have learned our lesson about unilateral aggression and stuck to destabilizing S. American countries, our area of expertise. International we're not. Even the UN is hesitant about attempting to rectify our Iraq disaster, especially as our ties to Israel's direction become more blatant.

Second, we did SLAUGHTER yes SLAUGHTER opposition. I'm using slaughter as to represent the merciless onslaught of military offense that ended the war. Yes it did come at a price, but the word slaughter is used appropriate. Your connotative definition implies that we did not suffer losses. Read a dictionary, they're not that expensive. And about Mr. Kim Jong, he possesses WMDs and the capabilities to use them just as Iraq did. Or as we thought they did. If we find it within our liberties to invade any country with this destructive power we should be fair about it. Now yes, I know no WMDs have been found in Iraq yet, but without that knowledge we can assume the same with North Korea. The example stands, your argument doesn't.",
