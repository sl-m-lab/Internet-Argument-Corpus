   "Well, representatives of US and European companies have recently begun to visit Abkhazia with suggestions to create 'free economic zone' in boundary area. Foreigners suggest profitable contracts and bargains, by this way they try to find the most profitable field of Abkhazian economy. And all this happens in the very time when Georgia is growing its military might and regular information about possible Georgian military campaign against Abkhazia. Tbilisi sets itself as an object force variant of solving territorial integrity problem. And of course it gives birth to certain doubts about frankness of foreign companies. First of all it is Georgian businessmen who work under the mask of foreign investors and hope to get control over profitable enterprises and directions before the start of military operation. Georgians are so much sure they will get control over Abkhazia that have started the process of repartition of Abkhazian property. Well, I think that now we need to resist against temptation to get well bargain otherwise any way this problem is solved, Abkhazia will lose everything!",
