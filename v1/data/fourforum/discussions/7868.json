   "ALL EUROPEANS ARE ILLEGAL/WHITES GET OUT!THIS IS OUR LAND/THE LATINOS ARE COMING.WE'RE IN A CIVIL WAR.\n \n If you think I'm illegal because because I'M Mexican,learn the true history because I\"m in my homeland.\n \n These are some of the signs you would see at the illegal alien rallies around the country. They are giving American citizens a preview of what the future holds for our nation if we don't make a stand today. George Bush and Congress are either too cowardly to act or they have another agenda and it doesn't include us.\n \n Bush, as I have stated before, will not secure the borders. He wants to put in place the North American Community, an economic and political union of America, Canada, and Mexico by 2010. All three leaders were in Cancun this week and the union was a significant part of the talks.\n \n The task force plan is to have open borders so that citizens of all three member states can \"live and work\" in any member state, eventually. This will continue to drive down wages and benefits. Trade agreements will be the driving force, benefitting multinational corporations [Wal-Mart et al] The goal, if the FTAA is passed, is a regional trading state, consisting of 34 nations of the Western Hemisphere. All 34 nations will no longer be sovereign and independent.\n \n The Mexicans have an agenda, also, and it doesn't include George Bush, Hillary Clinton or corporate CEOs. They want the Southwest United States returned to the \"indigenous\" bronze people of Aztlan. Most of the 12 to 20 million illegals in our country, plus a number of Mexican/Americans, support this invasion. [They will tell you loudly that this is an invasion and that the gringos must leave, also known as ethnic cleansing.] \n \n Many offices in the Southwest U.S., including Congress, are held by former radical racist MEchA members or supporters. Two prominent Mexican/American mechistas are: Cruz Bustamante, Lt. Governor of California and Antonio Villaraigosa, Mayor of Los Angeles and a leading player in the Reconquista movement to reconquer the Southwest U.S. and possibly beyond.\n \n Think they're not serious? A quote from Professor Jose Angel Gutierrez, University of Texas, Arlington, founder of the La Raza Unida Party: \"We have got to eliminate the gringo [white American], and what I mean by that is that if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill him.\" \n \n Go to www.wehategringos.com and watch the videos [marches , demonstrations] then check out the signs and listen to what they [men, women, and children] are saying. Reconquista is a hot topic in the Hispanic broadcast and print media. No amount of spin or \"interpretation\" can make this go away.\n \n The American Southwest \"...seems to be slowly returning to the jurisdiction of Mexico without firing a shot.\" July 20,1982, Carlos Loret de Mola, The Great Invasion:Mexico Recovers Its Own, Excelsior [newspaper], Mexico City\n \n Throughout history it has been the inaction of those who could have acted, the indifference of those who should have known better, the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most, that has made it possible for evil to triumph.\" Haile Selassie",

More people in work should mean less people entitled to benefits. \n\n \n That is because \"supposed to be\" is the operative term here. The numbers have been juggled. WE now count \"discouragd workers\", people who have been unable to find a job for a year or more even if they are looking, as out of the work force and drop them form our unemployment figures. This is why we keep seeing odd shifts in the unemployment numbers at predictable times.\n \n \nAlso, it seems likely that immigrant labour (illegal or otherwise) becomes indispensable to a growing economy only when unemployment reaches zero. This is no doubt a facile connection, but I can't see what's wrong with it.\n\n \n It also becomes indespensible when when your social benifits become attractive enough to discourage people from taking low paying jobs.

That's due to the feds picking up the tab through reimbursement for the big pieces as part of revenue sharing with states.

Here's a rather muddled commentary on that sentiment. \n \n Here in the UK, we have a crude media myth about American society that paints a grim picture of the poor falling through an inadequate welfare safety net and ending up in line for a pitiful allocation of food stamps.

We live in a consumer society, so people expect to consume; all the time. If they can't afford to consume all the things they want, then why shouldn't the state assist them?

As gung-ho as everyone in our government was about protecting us from terrorists, they fail to see that an unsecured border that can let 11-15 million illegal immigrants in can also let terrorists in. The majority of the Mexicans that are running over the border and making it to the US do so with very little effort at being covert. Imagine how easy it would be for a well financed terrorist of group of terrorists who actually make an effort to come here secretly. \n \n 3. Once a wall is in place, deport all illegals serving time in US jails. Further, deport any illegals arrested and found guilty of a crime in the US. Offer a reasonable path to citizenship without fear of deportation to anyone who applies and follows through. Use the saved money here to issue, track, and enforce regulations on temporary workers.\n \n 4.
