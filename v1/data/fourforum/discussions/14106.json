   "My maternal grandmother's family migrated from the Rhineland to America starting in the 1730s and eventually ended up on North Carolina. They used their Rhenish dialect of German as their everyday language up until the time of the Rebellion when it was replaced by English for everything but their Lutheran church services. However, their Rhenish did not totally die out until the 1930s- when my grandmother could remember hearing her grandparents use it whenever they wanted to say something that they didn't want the children to understand.\n \n The situation was pretty much the same among the Pennsylvania Dutch. The officers in Pennsylvania national guard units that went to France during World War I realized that if they spoke their Germanic dialect and French army officers spoke standard High German they could communicate more easily than if the Americans tried to speak French or the French tried to speak English.\n \n And then there was a Pennsylvania guard unit that strayed behind enemy lines and was about to be fired upon by a German artillery unit (due to their strange uniforms)- until the Americans started talking in their Germanic dialect and the Germans thought they were actually German.\n \n America has never been the linguistic monolith that some Republicans and self-proclaimed conservatives want to believe it was.\n \n Of course the stupidest thing I have ever seen from a tea partier was when I passed an SUV that had a bumper sticker: Taxed Enough Already- when the vehicle had a specialty license plate that the owner had to give the government extra money to get.",

My mother's mother came from the earliest Lutheran families to settle in Western NC.

But I never knew him to be anything but an atheist and all-around miserable excuse for a human being.\n \n My mother is, for all practical purpose, an atheist.

   "Martin Luther was anti-semitic. It was the confounding sin of the time, meaning that virtually everyone was guilty of it.\n\n \n Actually Great Britain has very little history of anti-Semitism. You can count the number of documented anti-Jewish instances in British history on the fingers of just one or two hands. Even King Edward III's official expulsion of the Jews really didn't have any real world effect because practically nobody cared whether or not it was enforced. Britain has known nothing of the pogroms of France, Germany or Eastern Europe.\n \n Roman Catholic Church officials in Italy have often been anti-Semitic, but among ordinary Italians anti-Semitism has been essentially unknown. During World War II Jews intentionally sought refuge in Italy even though Italy was allied with Germany until the Allied invasion of 1943. Mussolini even had a Jewish mistress until Hitler found out. The Italians were always lax in enforcing the anti-Semitic laws that the Germans made them enact. And a higher percentage of Italian Jews than French Jews survived the Germans.\n \n Also, when Roman Catholic Spain expelled the Jews in 1492, they were welcomed into the Ottoman Empire by the Turks. Martin Luther-style anti-Semitism has not been universal by any means.",
