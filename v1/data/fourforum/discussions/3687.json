Malum Inse laws are everyone's \"Real Laws\", laws that prohibit murder, theft, rape, etc. Malum Prohibitum laws are laws that say things are wrong not because they are bad in and of themselves, but because the government has said they are bad (ex.: speed limit, smoking in courthouses, and drugs).

I smoked crack or something, does that mean i should go to jail for 4-5 years?? for ONE mistake? shouldn't i do something like probation and community service to LEARN from my mistake? and as to addicts, they're just waiting to get out of jail, so they can go shoot up or smoke or whatever. It has been shown that treatment, not jailtime, makes recoverey and staying away from the drugs FIFTEEN TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE. and don't we want to get these people off the drugs? don't we want to HELP them, instead of locking them up and throwing away the key for who knows how many years! also as Master_shake so wisely put it, it RIPES the judge of one of their sole purposes there, deciding case by case the jail time. if it's not case by case, then there is always that one little case that deserves WAY more or WAY less, making the system biased as hell.",

Why is it that the goverment is so concerned with what people put into their bodies? I personally do not use drugs and have not for about 6 years so I could care less if they legalize them or not. But as a taxpayer I just don't get why the government spend so much money on trying to stop people from taking drugs. The United States' drug war is assanine and at the pinnacle of this stupidity are mandatory minimals which put many otherwise good citizens (I am not saying all these people are angels, but many get much more than they deserve) behind bars for periods greater than many violent offenders and sexual predators. Ask yourself this question, would you rather live next to some individual who smokes large amounts of marijauna habitually or a child molester/rapist.
