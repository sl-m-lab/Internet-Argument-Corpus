   "IN A \"WILD PLACE:\" ASTRONOMERS FIND SEVEN PLANET-FORMING DISKS, DOUBLING TOTAL \n \n In a separate news conference, Lada will discuss her research showing that planets may come together and form in the disks in far less time than currently believed. Her findings suggest planets may form in the first 3 million years of a star's life, much earlier than the 10-12 million years thought previously. Although 3 million years may seem like a long time, it is actually brief for stars, which can live tens of billions of years. \"If you think of our Sun as a middle-age star and that middle-age people are about 36, it would seem planet formation occurs within 1 week of stellar birth,\" Lada said.",
