   "After reading your posts here, I feel that most of you are Democrat supporters. I guess, in the November election, you are going to vote for Democrats. You want the Democrats control the House and Senate. That's fine with me.\n\n I support rationality. If that happens to mean I'm a Democrat supporter, so be it, but what does that say about Republicans?\n Here's an example: I'm not thrilled with the Democratic candidate for governor in my state. But \"not thrilled with\" would be too kind when describing my opinion of the Republican candidate.\n \n \nBut I have a question for you. From the economy statistics, we are in one of the best four-year periods in American history. The overall economy looks so great, why you want the Congress switch hands?\n\n You've been smoking crack for the last four or six years, apparently. Bush has borrowed more money from foreign governments than all other presidents combined. The debt is through the roof. The poor are still being all but neglected, and the fatcats are still getting kickbacks.\n \n \nIf everything works fine, why change?\n\n You think everything is working fine? Okay, I'll accuse you of being a terrorist. The government will come ransack your residence without your permission and without a warrant, kidnap you, and take you to a foreign country where other agents will torture you. Or you can be forbidden to attend \"public\" speeches by politicians because you haven't submitted a signed statement of support for said politicians. Or you can be fined for invoking your right not to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Or you can have Newsweek and other periodicals censored in the name of covering the charade. You can also have more and more of the world despising our country because of what this country is doing. Republicans send our troops (and the rest of us, really) into danger under the guise of \"protecting our freedom and security\" while simultaneously ####### away our freedom and security under the guise of \"safety.\"\n But no, everything's just fine.\n \n \nNow the gas price is already below $2.00 per gallon in some places.\n\n Let's jack up the price of gas to about $5/gal, then when you're only paying $4/gal, you'll be happy, right?\n \n \nThe biggest issue in this election is how to protect this country against terrorism.\n\n I'd say not encouraging terrorism would be a good place to start. Unfortunately, the Republicans already boned us there.\n \n \nStill the old question. Are you better off than 4 years ago? I think most people would say yes, or at least not worse off. Only a very small portion are worse off. Go Uncle Sam.\n\n Damn right I'm better off than I was a mere four years ago; that's because some of the warmongering Republicans have realized that the current administration is full of liars, XXXXXX, and criminals. However, we all were much better off six years ago before King Bush II took office. Back then we had our rights, we didn't have a growing number of extremists plotting to kill us, and we didn't have an administration lying to the constituents about everything from the Constitution to who did what while in office.\n \n Go Uncle Sam. Keep up this conscious effort to convince dimwits that everything's just fine...",

But the only thing that scares me worse is the idea of a Pelosi/Reid era and their cronies running things.",

   "Unsurprisingly, given that I support the Green Party in the UK, I find the US Green Party platform rather more appealing than either of the republicrat parties. Couple of things I disagree with, like curtailing human exploration of space, and I think it's a bit wishy washy in places. The \"We are not proposing a bigger overall role for government\" seems a bit of a copout too. They're a fringe party, why not say what needs to be said rather than pandering to people who will never vote for them anyway? They should be articulating the idea that there are some things government does better than the private sector, and while taxes will go up to pay for them, it will cost you less overall.",
