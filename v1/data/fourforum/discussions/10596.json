   "Nope! Not for the gay issue...\n Heaven forbid that happen...\n \n They gotta reserve Biblical re-writes for issues that actually affect them, which will be convenient for them to re-write...\n Any re-write that only \"un-sins\" a small group of people would obviously be a violation of God's word... emoticon_rolleyes \n On questions relating to the Bible's treatment of family and morals, one might expect assurance, if not rigidity, from Evangelical Christianity. So, it may surprise many to learn how \"live\" the topic of divorce remains in Evangelical circles. Last month, the cover story of the monthly Christianity Today was titled \"When to Separate What God has Joined: A Closer Reading on the Bible on Divorce.\" The heated controversy provoked by the story showed how Biblically flexible some Evangelicals can be - especially when God's word seems at odds not just with modern American behavior, but also with simple human kindness. \n \n As the article's author, the British Evangelical scholar David Instone-Brewer, points out, for most of 2,000 years Christians have viewed divorce through two scriptural citations. In Matthew, the pharisees ask Christ, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?\" Jesus refers to the Old Testament and then replies, \"Whoever divorces a wife, except for sexual indecency, commits adultery.\" The apostle Paul adds in the book First Corinthians that a Christian is \"not bound\" to a non-Christian spouse who abandons him. Simple, right?\n \n Instone-Brewer radically reinterprets the first passage using, of all things, quotation marks. The Greek of the New Testament didn't always contain them, and scholars agree that sometimes they must be added in to make sense of it. Instone-Brewer, an expert in Jewish thought during Jesus's era, writes that Christ's interlocutors were not asking him whether there was any cause at all for divorce, but whether he supported something called \"any-cause\" divorce, a term a little bit like \"no-fault\" that allowed husbands to divorce wives for any reason at all. Instone-Brewer claims Jesus's \"no\" was a response to this idea, and that his \"except for sexual indecency\" condition was not a statement of the sole exemption from God's blanket prohibition, but merely Christ's reiteration of one of several divorce permissions in the Old Testament - one he felt the \"any-time\" advocates had exaggerated. Finally, Instone-Brewer tallies four grounds for divorce he finds affirmed in both Old and New Testaments: adultery, emotional and sexual neglect, abandonment (by anyone) and abuse.\n \n Christianity Today has written previously on divorce, often bemoaning how easy it is in today's America. However, the Instone-Brewer essay appeared to be its editors' attempt to offer Evangelicals an escape from a classic dilemma. The \"plain sense\" of Jesus's words without quotes seems clear enough, but also inhumane: how could a loving God forbid divorce, even by omission, in cases of wife-beating, or of abandonment by a Christian spouse?http://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20071106/us_time/anevangelicalrethinkondivorce",

   "\"some marriages, God didn't put together. So it's okay to divorce.\"\n \n quote from Pentecostal congregationist I spoke with once.\n \n \"some people just grow apart.\"\n \n another quote from a 2nd evangelical fundy.\n \n 1 Corin 7:15\n But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.\n \n Some have twisted this passage and call to 'live in peace' to justify divorce amongst a believer EVEN when the non-believer didn't want a seperation. Placing emphasis on what the believer is experiencing over any other concerns. Taken out of context, the believer can NOT be in peace if their unbelieving spouse is causing them problems (real OR imagined). Thus, it'd be best to divorce the unbeliever.\n \n Pretty radical eisegesis but, it happens often. I've seen it several times with some fundy groups.\n \n Also, a shrewd reading on the bible could leave you with the impression that it is okay to seperate and divorce BUT, the only way you can remarry anyone else (and not have it considered adultry) is due to infidelity.\n So couple AB could split up and if B engaged or engages in infidelity (even when divorced) then A is free. 1 Corin 7:10-11\n To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.\n \n Some people have taken advantage of this as 1 Corinthians also speaks about what can happen when seperation occurs...one partner may stumble and 'cheat'.\n 7:5-6 Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. I say this as a concession, not as a command. \n \n \n In the end, it's my personal finding that most people will grasp at anything to support their desires. Even the bible is twisted (or not) to support what they want. \n My favorite twisting is by the Word of Faith movement (health wealth prosperity cult) that pretty much says the riches of the evil are there for the loyal followers of God to claim...basically supporting the notion that it's OKAY to steal...provided that you're doing so from a 'bad guy'.\n I've seen it done.\n Awsome!",

I am suggesting that the political process be limited to secular issues, rather than religiously doctrinal ones. If some religious people have a problem of conscience about some activity, then it is perfectly appropriate for them to abstain from that activity. \n \n If they want to support legislation preventing others from partaking in that activity, then it is incumbent upon them to demonstrate how that activity harms society as a whole, rather than just infringing their religious doctrines.\n \n Some moral issues are so transcendent, that society needs to legislate against them: e.g. murder, theft. There is a genuine, secular need there. Others are much less so, such as gay marriage or the form of religious service.\n \n There will always be issues in the middle, such as abortion or stem cell research. As long as there is no overwhelming consensus in society, liberty of choice is the preferred option. \n \n I am a great believer in respect for life, if only because it is so rare, unusual and contingent. However, that also has to include respect for dissent. Some issues are clearcut, such as murder. It is certainly not at all clearcut that abortion is murder. There has to be room left for dissent here, because intolerance of dissent is contrary to respect for life. Confused?

If our freedoms are going to mean anything, they unfortunately must include the freedom to be stupid. So while there are lots of things voters should do, it's fundamental to our system that nothing be done to insure that they do it. So while I could come up with a whole laundry list of things that the overly religious should or should not do in the policical arena there's not an item on the list that I would see imposed upon them.
