   "I do realise this is a situation from the UK, however, I have read many times on these boards that if you let the gays marry then why not brother & brother, brother and sister or two sisters.\n \n Now they are not so interested in marriage it seems. From what I make of the article, there are gays & Lesbians signing into domestic partnerships and they feel discriminated against because they are not being extended all the same legal rights. \n \n They have been ruled against twice, so now it goes to the highest court in the UK. This should be interesting. \n I know their are posters on here from the UK that could maybe shed some light on this situation. \n \n http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/09/091007sisters.htm\n \n \nSpinster Sisters Ask For Same Rights As Lesbian Couple\n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff \n \n Posted: September 10, 2007 - 5:00 pm ET \n \n (London) Two elderly sisters who live together say they should have the same rights as a lesbian couple and are taking their case to Europe's highest court. \n \n The women, who have lived together since birth and have never married are suing the government in the European Court of Human Rights.\n \n In their lawsuit Joyce Burden and her sister Sybil, both in their 80s, claim that when one of them dies the other would be required to pay massive inheritance taxes.\n \n They argue that the taxes would be unfair since unmarried same-sex couples are exempt from the tax under Britain's civil partnership law.\n \n In UK law there is a 40 percent inheritance tax an exemption for the first $500,000. Married couples, and couples in civil partnerships, are exempt from the tax. \n \n The women's lawyer says that when the law, allowing gay and lesbian couples to register their partnerships and attain all of the rights of marriage, was passed it should have included cohabitating family members who are dependant on one another.\n \n The lawsuit says that the women spent their lives looking after their parents and inherited the family home, but when one of the sisters dies the tax law would force the survivor to sell the home in which she grew up and leave her with little money on which to live.\n \n \"If we were a lesbian couple, we would not be facing massive inheritance bills,\" 88 year old Joyce Burden said when the case was filed. \n \n The lawsuit is based on two sections of the European Human Rights Convention: the right to enjoy property and the non-discrimination provision.\n \n The women have lost the case through the British legal legal system, including an appeal to the House of Lords.\n \n Last December a panel of seven judges on the European court in a split decision also ruled against them. This week the case will go to the Grand Chamber of the court - the highest civil rights court in Europe\n",

That's a good reason to lock them up. Didn't go to medical school? No medical license for you. Not a veteran? Then you don't get vet benefits. See how that works? Real, concrete, meaningful reasons to treat people differently. Is there any reason to treat committed gay couples differenly from commited straight couples? I've been asking that here for years, and the \"best\" answer so far boils down to \"some people don't like gays\". Which is to say, no reason at all.

Does the taboo apply to homosex and if so why should it? emoticon_xbye\n\n \n Well, it's true that incest taboos are really all about preventing procreation between people who are too closely related genetically, so I suppose there is no biological reason not to allow homosexual siblings to marry. Still, the purpose of marriage is to provide a legal relationship between non-kin that already exists between kin. For example, siblings will automatically inherit from each other if neither is married or has kids.\n \n I think there is some force in the argument that there may be non-sexual domestic relationships which deserve similar protections to homosexual or heterosexual ones, and I'd certainly not object to providing those through civil/domestic partnership agreements. They are families of a sort, too, and deserve support. \n \n The only thing I object to is the implication by homophobes that a gay marriage is nothing more than two people who simply live together. For reasons of their own, they wish to negate an entire and vital aspect of such a partnership that doesn't exist between people who aren't sexually partnered. If government were to make the same benefits, privileges and protections available to all domestic partnerships equally, without treating heterosexual couples as somehow superior, then that would be fine by me. However, the whole point of the homophobes is to protect heterosexual privilege, so that solution is less likely.",

   "But they don't want the benefits and responsibilities of marriage. I don't know about the UK, but in the US the full list would take a book to list. They want one thing, a change in the tax laws. That's it, end of story. The connection between this story and marriage, gay or otherwise, is tenuous at best.\n\n \n Well, I disagree that this story is irrelevant to the issues being raised here. It's true that the two sisters aren't asking for their domestic relationship to be recognised as a marriage with all the protections thus implied. However, they wouldn't have been asking for anything at all were it not for the fact that gays and lesbians in Britain have been granted most of the rights and protections of marriage, including protection from certain kinds of taxation.\n \n Like it or not, that is among the reasons people are demanding legal equality for gay marriages, though it is not the only reason. Once you do extend these protections to gay couples in a relationship other than a traditional heterosexual marriage, then you're hard put to argue that they shouldn't be extended to all couples in similar domestic circumstances. I wouldn't care to make such an argument, and think the extension is perfectly reasonable in such a case.\n \n Once you buy the argument that the state has an interest in supporting and encouraging civil partnerships, why should they be restricted solely to couples who have, or once had, or might in principle even if never in practice have a sexual relationship? Is it the government's business what they do in their bedroom(s)?\n \n I think the definition of family has changed a lot and expanded in the West, whether one thinks it for the better or worse, and government should reflect that change, rather than selecting one kind of family it regards as superior to every other, and thus deserving of more rights and privileges.",

I can certainly think of many reasons for gay marriage, and you know what, they are all pretty much the same as reasons for straight marriage.\n Ok, lets assume to form stable families and benefits as those are the main ones mentioned. If you believe in \"equal protection\" is defined as \"equal treatment\" for the 14th amendment then doesn't this mean the benefits and ability to have a family should be same across the board? For example a single mom or dad should be able to have a family and the sisters in this case should have the benefits.

If there were a big polygamy-rights movement going on trying to broaden marriage instead the gay rights movement, no doubt they too would face controversy and opposition.

If you really claim to have shown something, as in presented real reasons based on facts, then I totally missed it and would really appreciate either a pointer to where you did so, or a reiteration of your presentation.\n\n This is a somewhat different discussion than you and I have been having. But just in case you missed it, I'll explain it again. Keep in mind that this argument only addresses the claim that, \"You want to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation, so that only people of your sexual orientation can marry.\" If one wishes to claim that same-sex marriage prohibitions are based on sexual orientation, then it would be necessary to show that gays are being denied marriage because they are gay. Now I claim that, whatever marriage restrictions are based upon, they are not based upon one's sexual orientation. Let me try to illustrate.\n \n If you were to try and obtain a marriage license, you would not be denied a marriage license if you were to announce, \"I'm gay\" at the top of your lungs. Nor would you inherently be denied a marriage license if you were to announce, \"I'm gay, and so is the person I wish to marry.\" So long as the persons wishing to marry are of an opposite gender, they are able to be married. This means that if a gay man and a gay woman wished to get married, then they would be allowed to unless they don't meet some other restriction on the marriage institution. Likewise would be the case if a homosexual male wished to marry a heterosexual female (and vice versa).\n \n Therefore, it is obvious that whatever reasons underlie the decision to prohibit same-sex marriage, sexual orientation is not one of those reasons.\n \n \nNo, that's a dodge if one is being polite, and a deception of one is being blunt. Restrictions against gays only effect gays, so the fact that they apply equally is meaningless, you're just hiding behind specific wording so your argument doesn't really carry much weight. You keep harping on how everyone has the same rules apply to everyone, but that is irrelevent if they don't effect any but gays.\n\n I was repeating the logic of lesz. It follows from the premise. \n \n Now, I have previously argued that equal protection guarantees only secure equal protection (a procedural guarantee) and not a substantive guarantee. I'm not hiding behind mere semantics. I am, I confess, hiding behind traditional understandings of the equal protection clause.

No one is saying they can't.\n\n The quote I gave you was not a hypothetical one. It is, in fact, being asserted time and time again on this board. I never make things up. \n You want to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation, so that only people of your sexual orientation can marry.This was said by none other than lesz in this post. Such is clearly not the case. It is non-factual. False. And it would be nice to hear more people from both sides of the issue press honesty in the debate. I think it would go a long way in bringing honesty back into this discussion.\n \n \nWhat we are saying is that they can't marry who they want to, strictly and solely because they are gay.\n\n This is what I am saying is not accurate. The restriction is not based on orientation. It is based (at the very best) on gender. No one is being denied marriage because they are gay, which is what would be necessary to make the claim that the classification is based on sexual orientation. If a person desires to marry a person of the same-sex, they will be denied in most cases. But that denial will not be based upon whether the person is homosexual or heterosexual. It will be based upon the fact that the person is of the same-sex.\n \n \nNote the \"who they want to\" part, it's really important. Telling someone they have the right to do something they would never want to do isn't giving them any right at all, it's an empty gesture. Sure, a gay man and a gay woman could, in theory, get married to each other. But what good is that theory if the reality is something neither would want? Saying you can marry whoever you like as long as they're of the opposite gender discriminates against gays as surely as a law that says you can vote for whoever you like as long as they're a Democrat would discriminate against Republicans.\n\n I must say that I am wholly unpersuaded that the \"who they want to\" part has any significance in the legal definition of civil marriage. If I were to be honest about it, I think it is nothing but rhetoric in this debate. Consider, for example, that some of the other marriage restrictions also conceivably restrict a person's ability to marry who they want to. I will go so far as to say that one does not have the right to marry the person they want to.\n \n And the latter analogy does not work. The reason a law requiring to vote for a particular party would fail is not because it violated equal protection, but rather because it violates the first amendment. However, assuming for the sake of argument that it was challenged on equal protection grounds, it would be evaluated at a higher level of judicial scrutiny because it violates a fundamental right. When considered on legal grounds, the analogy is one between apples and monkeys.\n \n \nSo, do you have any arguments that address claims that anyone has actually made?\n\n I can only respectfully ask that you pay closer attention to the things that are being said here. There are many, many cases where the argument I just refuted has been offered. It would be nice to have someone who disagrees with me on the substance of the debate at least join with me in striving to keep the debate honest.",

Of course they are based on sexual orientation -- the religious extremists didn't bother to start trying to \"define\" marriage as 'one man and one woman\" so hysterically till gay Americans began lobbying to have their marriages legally recognised. The history of these repressively anti-gay bits of legislation give the lie to your claim to have \"shown\" anything different. \n \n \nOf course, this has been confirmed by court after court after court. Yes, even the courts that have granted gay marriage have confirmed this.\n\n \n It's the height of sophistry to argue that because gay people aren't prohibited from marrying opposite sex partners, that therefore they aren't banned from marriage on the basis of their sexual orientation. The only reason we insist on our right to have our marriages recognised equally under the law is BECAUSE of our sexual orientation. Otherwise, we'd all happily enter a straight marriage. However, such a marriage is usually a sham.\n \n Why is this so difficult to compute?\n \n \nRestrictions on gay marriage apply to everyone the same way irrespective of sexual orientation.

Anyone who can argue with a straight face to the effect that \"gay people aren't discriminated against because they have the same right to marry an opposite sex partner straight people have\" either doesn't understand the concept of sexual orientation, or is being deliberately obtuse.\n \n As for polygamy, it's not a sexual orientation. It is not a denial of anyone's nature or core sexuality to be refused a polygamous marriage license, so long as everyone is refused such a license. It's just a legal formality that applies equally across the board. This is not the case for denial of gay marriage. Denial of gay marriage goes beyond mere legalism into an attack against the rights of gay people under the US Constitution.

The irony is unreal.\n \n Can you prove its natural?\n \n \n If it occurs in nature, it's natural by definition. *shrug* Polygamy is a moderately common social institution (a form of marriage) and it is not a natural sexual orientation; being gay or straight is. I exist, I experience sexual attraction only towards members of my own sex, I am a product of nature, and I identify in Western society as \"gay\". What's \"unnatural\" there? Why should i have to justify or \"prove\" my innate feelings to you? Of course they're natural -- I wouldn't be able to feel them if they weren't.\n \n If you can prove to me that it is deeply offensive to the core of anyone's nature to ban polygamy, and that it hurts them, then I'll think again about my opposition to it. However, experience shows that polygamy is usually little more than a social device to subjugate women in a patriarchal society, and it also results in great inequality among males. Now if you want to argue there's nothing wrong with that, go right ahead, but perhaps a gay rights forum isn't the best place for it.\n \n \nThere is no proof it is 100% caused by genetics and being natural wouldn't mean much to me anyway....there are plenty of things that are natural that people find are bad. There are plenty of things that are partially natural that people find are bad.\n\n \n Yawn. Are you seriously arguing that the only natural traits are the direct product of single genes? Sorry, but genetic determinism went out with eugenics as valid science. Humans, like other animals, undergo a developmental process that involves a complex interaction between genes and environment. No-one is arguing that sexual orientation is 100% determined by a single gene or even by a group of genes alone. To the best of current scientific knowledge -- and I do follow this fairly closely -- it is biologically determined, probably in utero, and once determined, it rarely if ever changes. It is not 100% determined by genes, there are biological and environmental factors in play as well.\n \n And the argument that if it is natural, it doesn't make it right, is also weak. Who are you to condemn gay marriages morally? Why should the state reflect your biases and discriminate against me as a result?\n \n \nI only claim you don't really believe in equality because when the same arguments are used for other situations you change tunes.\n\n \n Actually, I argue that polygamy and gay marriage aren't simply comparable, and that therefore facile comparisons don't hold water. There may be elements in common, but the arguments are not interchangeable.\n \n \nRestrictions on orientation apply to everyone, irrespective of numbers involved. Like I said, you just want to change the restrictions...but you still want some and that is not \"equality\" no matter what.\n\n \n As long as straight people are allowed to marry, and gay ones are not, inequality will persist. Pretending it doesn't is hardly a clinching argument! It is no argument to pretend that as straight people aren't allowed to have same sex marriages either, there is no discrimination against gays. As i pointed out to Phyllis, that either exhibits ignorance of the concept of sexual orientation, or deliberate sophistry. Given the concept and implications of marriage, straight people are only going to want to marry the opposite sex, and gay people are only going to want to marry the same sex. \n \n Why do you folk have such a problem with this?

The women need mates and the protection of a male (in traditional societies anyway) and when men constitute only say 1 in 3 or 4 of the population one institution which helps the social system keep operating is polygamy.

   "I\n \n Its a bit more than that. Polygamy is sometimes the result of a shortage of men (or a surplus of women - whichever). The women need mates and the protection of a male (in traditional societies anyway) and when men constitute only say 1 in 3 or 4 of the population one institution which helps the social system keep operating is polygamy. In rare cases its the women who are in very short supply and polyandry has been known to be the compensatory method resorted to.\n \n You can however see the strains that biologically inappropriate polygamy has on a society in the Fundametalist Mormons. They are having to resort to expulsion of young males in order to maintain their prefered style of marriage and family. But of course it does make for interesting HBO series.\n\n \n I agree that a fair number of societies have resorted to polygyny or much more rarely, polyandry (usually here the two males are siblings, though), for ecological or population reasons. Such arrangements might continue traditionally long after the original ecological reasons evaporated. However, id argue that biologically speaking, we are from our fairly equal sex ratios on and our most common habits, monogamous or at least serially monogamous. We aren't elephant seals or deer where only a few dominant males breed!\n \n Still, I agree with you that on the whole, all other things being equal, polygamy is more of a strain on society than a help. I very much suspect that among the reasons terrorism is so rife in some Muslim nations is the persistence of polygyny with the consequent surplus of young males with no hope of marriage or even sex. All those hormones, and nowhere to go! No wonder they go ballistic so easily.",

   "Phyllis\n \n While I'm thinking about it, a couple more comments on the motivation of legal bias against gay Americans. To some extent, we've been arguing at cross purposes. You've been making much of the legal technicality that no laws actually single out groups of people for unequal treatment on the overt basis of sexual orientation. I focus on the social and political realities that motivate anti-gay legislation.\n \n Technically, you are correct. Ever since Romer v. Evans overthrew Colorado's Amendment 2 (which banned anti-discrimination laws in the state predicated on sexual orientation) on the basis that a law could not declare a group of people strangers to the law (an equal protections argument), legislators who have wished to clip the wings of gay people have been careful to frame laws in such a way that they can be technically read as unbiased. To do otherwise was to tempt strict scrutiny, which anti-gay legislators obviously want to avoid like the plague.\n \n The anti-gay marriage laws do not explicitly read \"homosexuals shall be prohibited from marriage\", though obviously that is their spirit of their intent; technically, they \"only\" restrict marriage to opposite sex couples. It is unnecessary they be explicit about the reason for such laws: it's universally accepted that they exist to prevent gay people from marrying other gay people of the same sex. Were it not for same sex gay marriage, such laws would not exist at all. And many of them are so far-reaching and vindictive, gay partners are left without any possibility of contracting legal protections at all.\n \n Such laws are only technically not predicated on sexual orientation, but the only reason to ban same sex marriage is to prevent gay people from marrying, or enjoying the legal protections of marriage. After all, there is no great groundswell from heterosexuals for the right to enter a same sex marriage, for fairly obvious reasons that need no elaboration. The only people likely to be interested in same sex marriage are gays.\n \n So let's stop with this foolish pretense that gay people are being treated equally under the law. That only applies if one very fastidiously looks only at the letter of the law, and ignores the spirit and intent. To do that is to forsake all understanding of the context of the law, and become trapped in picayune technicalities. Once again, Phyllis, I ask you try to see the wood for the trees.",

   " The quote I gave you was not a hypothetical one. It is, in fact, being asserted time and time again on this board. I never make things up. \n You want to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation, so that only people of your sexual orientation can marry.This was said by none other than lesz in this post. Such is clearly not the case. It is non-factual. False. And it would be nice to hear more people from both sides of the issue press honesty in the debate. I think it would go a long way in bringing honesty back into this discussion. \n\n Ok, I'll grant those words have been used here. But did you try taking them in context? We all know that gays can get married and that no law is stopping that. What is clearly, blatantly meant is allowed to married your loved one. Loving the person you marry is such an intrinsic part of the concept that it really should be taken for granted, it's not something that one should have to hammer home every time one talks about marriage.\n \n \n \n This is what I am saying is not accurate. The restriction is not based on orientation. It is based (at the very best) on gender. No one is being denied marriage because they are gay, which is what would be necessary to make the claim that the classification is based on sexual orientation. If a person desires to marry a person of the same-sex, they will be denied in most cases. But that denial will not be based upon whether the person is homosexual or heterosexual. It will be based upon the fact that the person is of the same-sex. \n\n And since gays are the only ones who are going to want to marry someone of the same sex...\n \n You're doing nothing by playing word games and hiding behind technicalities, while failing to address the real issue. The law says you can't marry someone of the same gender, and only gays are going to want to marry someone of the same gender, therefore the law discriminates against gays. If a restriction effects only one group, even if it doesn't specify that group by name, it discriminates against that group. That's a pretty obvious statement to me, please explain why you don't agree with it.\n \n \n \n I must say that I am wholly unpersuaded that the \"who they want to\" part has any significance in the legal definition of civil marriage. If I were to be honest about it, I think it is nothing but rhetoric in this debate. Consider, for example, that some of the other marriage restrictions also conceivably restrict a person's ability to marry who they want to. I will go so far as to say that one does not have the right to marry the person they want to.\n \n\n There are a few other restricitions on who you can marry, but none of them guarantee that you won't be able to marry someone you love, none of them eliminate in one swoop the entire class of person you find attractive. And those restrictions have real reasons behind them, while the restriction we're talking about is based on nothing but discriminating against gays.\n \n And \"who they want to\" isn't rhetoric, so don't just blow it off as such. It's a crucial point. Telling people they can have a right, but only in a way that they wouldn't want to do it, isn't giving them a right at all.\n \n \n \n And the latter analogy does not work. The reason a law requiring to vote for a particular party would fail is not because it violated equal protection, but rather because it violates the first amendment.\n\n Are you doing that on purpose? The discussion is about discrimination, not why a law would fail. Did you forget that, or are you deliberately moving the goal posts to avoid the issue?\n \n \n \n I can only respectfully ask that you pay closer attention to the things that are being said here. There are many, many cases where the argument I just refuted has been offered. It would be nice to have someone who disagrees with me on the substance of the debate at least join with me in striving to keep the debate honest. \n\n Even if the words you presented were in fact written, I defy you to find anyone here who doesn't know that gays can enter loveless, sexless marriage if they want to. When people say that gays can't get married they obviously mean they can't marry their loved ones. If you trully believe otherwise then produce someone who will back you up, find anyone here who will state that they think gays can't enter loveless, sterile marriages if they choose to. Otherwise please, refute what people mean, even if they aren't saying it as precisely as you might wish. That also is part of honest debate.",

We do discriminate against paedophiles, justifying that such actions harm others and therefore should be discriminated against.

Loving the person you marry is such an intrinsic part of the concept that it really should be taken for granted, it's not something that one should have to hammer home every time one talks about marriage.\n\n I've read and reread the post in question. Even with the added explanation from lesz I'm not sure that the context you (and lesz) assert is \"clearly, blatantly\" obvious. The part I called attention to was clearly making a claim about equality. It clearly accused steeeve of wanting to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation. I have shown that, in order for that to be true, it must be shown that the basis of the distinction is one's sexual orientation. I have not seen anyone make that argument on the forum. But discussion boards being what they are, I'll happily go with the clarification statements that have been given.\n \n I would suggest that the \"loved one\" clarification makes no difference. The definition of civil marriage does not in the least hinge on the question of love. I say that because in the various marriage statutes the opposite-sex requirement is not the only one that could presumably prevent one from marrying their loved one.\n \n \nAnd since gays are the only ones who are going to want to marry someone of the same sex...\n \n You're doing nothing by playing word games and hiding behind technicalities, while failing to address the real issue. The law says you can't marry someone of the same gender, and only gays are going to want to marry someone of the same gender, therefore the law discriminates against gays. If a restriction effects only one group, even if it doesn't specify that group by name, it discriminates against that group. That's a pretty obvious statement to me, please explain why you don't agree with it.\n\n It does not discriminate against gays. I am willing to concede that it does discriminate against same-sex couples. That is not the same thing, and it is not a word game. I have thought about this for a very long time and it seems to me that that is the only accurate way to describe the classification.\n \n \nThere are a few other restricitions on who you can marry, but none of them guarantee that you won't be able to marry someone you love, none of them eliminate in one swoop the entire class of person you find attractive. And those restrictions have real reasons behind them, while the restriction we're talking about is based on nothing but discriminating against gays.\n\n They appear to you to have real reasons behind them. But it's not out of the question that one day a group will come along and say, \"Hey, those reasons are not rational. All you are doing is discriminating against X. Therefore, restricting us from marriage is unconstitutional.\" This is a matter for legislatures and not judges.\n \n Can you be so certain that the arguments that justify changing the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples wouldn't be able to be used to justify incestuous or polygamous marriage some day?\n \n \nAnd \"who they want to\" isn't rhetoric, so don't just blow it off as such. It's a crucial point. Telling people they can have a right, but only in a way that they wouldn't want to do it, isn't giving them a right at all.\n\n It's not explicitly said, but it seems you are treating civil marriage as a right. I actually think that a better description of civil marriage is as a privilege rather than a right. Don't be caught off guard by that. The constitution protects privileges as well as rights. But I want to be as accurate as I can. Now let me try and explain the difference.\n \n Every person by default has first amendment rights whether they want them or not. This is not the case with civil marriage. Civil marriage is an institution created by statute (not constitutional provision) that anyone can enter into (if they meet the requirements), but not everyone does.\n \n Gays have a right to equal protection of the law. And my view is that the current status quo does not infringe on that right.\n \n \nAre you doing that on purpose? The discussion is about discrimination, not why a law would fail. Did you forget that, or are you deliberately moving the goal posts to avoid the issue?\n\n I think I mixed up what thread this was in. I'll go ahead and say that my statement is right, and I'll add something else.\n \n Discrimination is certainly happening. Every law discriminates. Now, I had to explain what the discrimination was, I would not say that it was discrimination against gay persons. I would not even say that it was discrimination against gay couples. It is a discrimination against same-sex couples. That's the only accurate way to describe what is happening.\n \n And for the record, I do not think discrimination is equivalent to inequality.\n \n \nEven if the words you presented were in fact written, I defy you to find anyone here who doesn't know that gays can enter loveless, sexless marriage if they want to. When people say that gays can't get married they obviously mean they can't marry their loved ones.

It was an accusation directed at steeeve. Lesz's clarification does not just clarify the meaning of the statement I challenged, it changes the statement completely. This is fine by me, actually. Mistakes can be made and should be allowed to be corrected. \"You want to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation, so that only people of your sexual orientation can marry.\" That statement is clear; it accuses a particular person (steeeve) of wanting to make a particular restriction (one based on sexual orientation). If I did not arrive at lesz's real meaning, it was not because I somehow misread or twisted his words. It was because lesz's words did not accurately reflect his thoughts. But that's not my problem.

As an example I would be ok with the process of a town banning the eating of cheese because they find it morally wrong. If I lived in the town I would fight against it because I love cheese but the state has every right to make such a law.\n \n \n \n \nIf it occurs in nature, it's natural by definition. *shrug* Polygamy is a moderately common social institution (a form of marriage) and it is not a natural sexual orientation; being gay or straight is.\n I never said polygamy was a sexual orientation.\n \n \nI exist, I experience sexual attraction only towards members of my own sex, I am a product of nature, and I identify in Western society as \"gay\".

Are you seriously arguing that the only natural traits are the direct product of single genes? Sorry, but genetic determinism went out with eugenics as valid science. Humans, like other animals, undergo a developmental process that involves a complex interaction between genes and environment. No-one is arguing that sexual orientation is 100% determined by a single gene or even by a group of genes alone. To the best of current scientific knowledge -- and I do follow this fairly closely -- it is biologically determined, probably in utero, and once determined, it rarely if ever changes. It is not 100% determined by genes, there are biological and environmental factors in play as well.\nI don't disagree that environmental factors play a role. My point is who cares and why should it make any difference?\n \n \nAnd the argument that if it is natural, it doesn't make it right, is also weak. Who are you to condemn gay marriages morally? Why should the state reflect your biases and discriminate against me as a result?\nI would be a person who believes in a right and wrong and therefore I can condemn what I find to be morally wrong. I could ask who are you to condemn stealing morally?\n \n \nActually, I argue that polygamy and gay marriage aren't simply comparable, and that therefore facile comparisons don't hold water. There may be elements in common, but the arguments are not interchangeable.\nSee the other post for an explanation of this. You really have a few roads to take here. If you support equality in marriage then you can't support any restrictions on marriage...its the simple. If you are going to say \"I support equality in marriage for sexual orientation only\" then you have already allowed restrictions on marriage and you would have to show why the orientation restriction is invalid yet the other restrictions are valid. Using the argument of \"equality\" is just playing to emotional language. I don't think you would say I'm for equality of marriage if I say \"I support equality among races in marriage\" but still am against gay marriage. \n \n In the end, at least qualify your \"equality\" argument by saying you really want a \"some are more equal than others\" view of marriage. If you want equality for orientation only then fine....but be honest and admit you aren't for equality of marriage.\n \n \nAs long as straight people are allowed to marry, and gay ones are not, inequality will persist. Pretending it doesn't is hardly a clinching argument\nI never say its not unequal...I do say the current marriage laws offer equal protection though.\n \n\n It is no argument to pretend that as straight people aren't allowed to have same sex marriages either, there is no discrimination against gays. As i pointed out to Phyllis, that either exhibits ignorance of the concept of sexual orientation, or deliberate sophistry. Given the concept and implications of marriage, straight people are only going to want to marry the opposite sex, and gay people are only going to want to marry the same sex. \nI'm sure Phyllis explained that there is a difference in equal protection and equal treatment.

   "If you seriously think love is irrelevant to marriage, you have my sympathy. And if you further think longevity of a relationship owes nothing to love, well, maybe you are missing out on something.\n\n \n Yes love is vital. It outlasts mere lust and passion. The greeks were very wise in having several words which they applied to love. Within marriage my experience is that all forms are present and vital.\n \n \nA number of different Greek words for love, as the Greek language distinguishes how the word is used. Ancient Greek has three distinct words for love: eros, philia, and agape. However, as with other languages, it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words. Nonetheless, the senses in which these words were generally used are given below.\n \n * Eros (&#7956;&#961;&#969;&#962; \u00e9r&#333;s) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Modern Greek word \"erotas\" means \"(romantic) love\". However, Eros does not have to be sexual in nature. Eros can be interpreted as a love for someone who you love more than the Philia love of friendship. It can also apply to dating relationships as well as marriage. Plato refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. It should be noted Plato does not talk of physical attraction as a necessary part of love, hence the use of the word platonic to mean, \"without physical attraction\". Plato also said Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty, and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. The most famous ancient work on the subject of eros is Plato's Symposium, which is a discussion among the students of Socrates on the nature of eros.\n \n * Philia (&#966;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945; phil\u00eda), means friendship in modern Greek, a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept developed by Aristotle. It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality and familiarity. In ancient texts, philia denoted a general type of love, used for love between family, between friends, a desire or enjoyment of an activity, as well as between lovers. This is the only other word for \"love\" used in the ancient text of the New Testament besides agape, but even then it is used substantially less frequently.\n \n * Agap&#275; (&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951; ag\u00e1p&#275;) means \"love\" in modern day Greek. The term s'agapo means \"I love you\" in Greek. The word \"agapo\" is the verb \"I love\". In Ancient Greek it often refers to a general affection rather than the attraction suggested by \"eros\"; agape is used in ancient texts to denote feelings for a good meal, one's children, and the feelings for a spouse. It can be described as the feeling of being content or holding one in high regard. The verb appears in the New Testament describing, amongst other things, the relationship between Jesus and the beloved disciple. In biblical literature, its meaning and usage is illustrated by self-sacrificing, giving love to all--both friend and enemy. It is used in Matthew 22:39, \"Love your neighbour as yourself,\" and in John 15:12, \"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you,\" and in 1 John 4:8, \"God is love.\" However, the word \"agape\" is not always used in the New Testament in a positive sense. II Timothy 4:10 uses the word in a negative sense. The Apostle Paul writes,\"For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved (agapo) this present world....\" Thus the word \"agape\" is not always used of a divine love or the love of God. Christian commentators have expanded the original Greek definition to encompass a total commitment or self-sacrificial love for the thing loved. Because of its frequency of use in the New Testament, Christian writers have developed a significant amount of theology based solely on the interpretation of this word.}\n \n * Storge (&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#942; storg&#275;) means \"affection\" in modern Greek; it is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring. Rarely used in ancient works, and then almost exclusively as a descriptor of relationships within the family.\n \n * Thelema means \"desire\" in modern Greek; it is the desire to do something, to be occupied, to be in prominence.\n",

   "Cosmic notions of equality or sexuality are only relevant to legislatures. These will be wide ranging, inconclusive, and disputable. But I care very much about Constitutional equality and the integrity of the Constitution.\n\n \n Actually, they are extremely relevant to individuals. Gay and straight Americans cannot both be served equally by laws restricting marriage to opposite sex couples. You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it. Why not just admit it?\n \n \nAs I explained to Kronus, I believe a better description of civil marriage is as a privilege rather than as a right.\n\n \n Well, you are entitled to your opinion that you only have a privilege to marry, and that people like me should have a final say in whom you are permitted to marry. You would trust me in this? I wonder...\n \n Numerous court decisions in the US (e.g. Loving v. Viginia) have asserted a basic human right to marry, however. It's also part of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.\n \n Yet according to you, Mr. and Mrs. loving should never have allowed their case to be taken to the courts, and the courts should never have supported their right to marry against local laws that prohibited miscegenation. Miscegenation is a wonderful word, isn't it. It proclaims the right of a society to interfere at a whim with the most personal decisions a human being can take. Society decides two people of different races should not be allowed to marry, and you would argue that does not infringe their human rights. Wow.\n \n Now you want to argue that prohibiting two gay human beings who chose each other as life partners should similarly not be allowed to marry, if society in its infinite wisdom decides they shouldn't. You advocate the tyranny of the majority over the minority. That's why you aren't right on this issue.\n \n I take my rights seriously, Phyllis, which is why i resolutely oppose any government that opposes my right to marry the person who consents to marry me. That is not a legitimate government.",

   "\n I would suggest that the \"loved one\" clarification makes no difference. The definition of civil marriage does not in the least hinge on the question of love. \n\n Who's talking about the definition of civil marriage? I'm certainly not. I'm talking about fairness and discrimintation. Please stop dragging in irrelevant observations. The point is that the marriage laws prevent gays from marrying their loved ones. It doesn't matter what the law says, everyone knows that that is the goal in marriage. To be with the person you love and make a life with them. And if gays want to get married, that can't have that.\n \n \n\n It does not discriminate against gays. I am willing to concede that it does discriminate against same-sex couples. \n\n Ok, walk me throught that one. You admit the discrimination against same-sex couples, fine. The vast majority of same sex couples that want to get married are gay; I haven't heard of a single case where they weren't gay. So the only group that gets hit by this is gays. So, you admit it's discrimination, and it primarily if not entirely effects gays. So how is it not discrimination against gays? This seems to be a major point with you and I don't see it at all, so lay it out for me.\n \n \n\n They appear to you to have real reasons behind them. But it's not out of the question that one day a group will come along and say, \"Hey, those reasons are not rational. All you are doing is discriminating against X. Therefore, restricting us from marriage is unconstitutional.\" \n \n Did you have any point to go with that observation? Because nothing you said there in any way refutes anything I've put forward. If others think they're being discriminated against they are of course free to put forward their case. That in no way effects the case I'm putting forward.\n \n \n\n Can you be so certain that the arguments that justify changing the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples wouldn't be able to be used to justify incestuous or polygamous marriage some day? \n\n How is that in the least bit relevant? You don't deny someone justice because someone in the future may or may not use similar arguments to get what they think is justice. That's absurd.\n \n \n\n It's not explicitly said, but it seems you are treating civil marriage as a right. I actually think that a better description of civil marriage is as a privilege rather than a right. Don't be caught off guard by that. The constitution protects privileges as well as rights. But I want to be as accurate as I can. Now let me try and explain the difference. \n\n The difference is moot. With marriage comes rights. The right to visit your loved one in the hospital, the right to not testify against your spouse, the right to automatically inherit. The list goes on and on. Again, you're just playing word games. You're calling it a quest for accuracy, but your \"accurate\" definitions aren't addressing the actual issues, they're diverting from them.\n \n \n\n Discrimination is certainly happening. Every law discriminates. Now, I had to explain what the discrimination was, I would not say that it was discrimination against gay persons. I would not even say that it was discrimination against gay couples. It is a discrimination against same-sex couples. That's the only accurate way to describe what is happening.\n \n\n And since there is no practical, functional difference between gay couples and same sex couples you are once again just playing word games.\n \n \n\n If I did not arrive at lesz's real meaning, it was not because I somehow misread or twisted his words. It was because lesz's words did not accurately reflect his thoughts. But that's not my problem. I can't climb into a person's head. \n\n In point of fact, it rather is your problem. Your interpretation of her words was, simply put, stupid. You would have to believe that Lesz was an utter idiot, or terminally ignorant, to think your interpretation was what she meant. You didn't even bother to double check that she meant such an idiotic thing, you just ran with it. When you said \"I don't care about justice\" I checked to make sure that you did not in fact literally mean what you said; that's honest debate. Basing whole arguments against an argument that only a XXXXX would make? I'm not sure what to call that, but honest debate it isn't.",

   "Hmmmm. Well, I would hope your state could advance a good reason for banning the eating of cheese. It certainly hasn't succeeded in advancing one for banning gay marriage.\n The good reason would be that the people wanted it that way. I can't find a better reason for a law than \"the people demand it\". Of course this doesn't make it a good law or bad law.\n \n \nBut you accused me of double standards with respect to polygamy.

It just means you can't discriminate against gay people. So long as restrictions apply equally to gays and straights, which they currently do not do, what's the problem?\nThat's not equality in marriage. That's equality in marriage for those with different orientations. It is a very different look at it and you certainly aren't for total equality...just less restrictions.\n \n \nNope. Where's the support of inequality? The point I have made is that a gay sexual orientation is legally the same as a straight sexual orientation. There is no reason for the state to discriminate between them, as it currently does. If you know of one, you haven't told me what it is.\n\n I have told you of one....because the people find it morally wrong. \n \n \nA distinction without a difference.

Check.\n \n \nCurrently it does apply equally to everyone with whom the institution applies.\n\n \n Except gays.

The ONLY problem is that this upsets some uptight people who should get a life a worry about more important things. \n \n There is no rational reason to keep same sex marriage illegal. There are many rational reasons to make it legal. Whenenver the topic has been looked at objectively, no harm comes to anyone, including those within the marriage and its family and there is demonstrable harm that comes from the lack of legalized marriage for same sex couples and their families. This harm far outweighs the only problem that it causes, some people getting upset. \n \n Harm to millions of people and their children in some fundamental ways\n \n vs.\n \n Getting your panties in a knot.\n \n A no brainer. \n \n There are no valid, non-religious reasons to oppose this.

That's a law I'd like to see. The idiocy of that argument is so obvious it should never be dignified with any further consideration. \n \n The issue of sodomy is separate - no rational reason for that to be illegal.

Many modern states are bound by their constitutions and cannot legitimately exceed the specified limitations. Under your \"principle\" the state could if it wished specify exactly who everyone would be married to. You would get the notice in the mail presumably. And of course your state could reassign married partners at its whim or by lottery or whatever. Sounds like Warren Jeffs to me.\n \n \nSeems to me it was written to set up a form of government.

But biologically humans do have a drive (Need?) to pair bond and procreate. Its evolved and necessarily so.\n \n \nThe state decided on one and they decided on one of the opposite sex.\n\n \n Did they? Really? What state are you referring to? And is not the judical process part of the \"state\"? Did not that process declare the law void temporarily?\n \n \nNo, the marriage rules apply to gays too. They apply to everyone in the same way. \n \n \n And laws requiring that all Jews report to concentration camps would be applied equally to all citizens also. Equal application does not assure equality nor does it insure justice to individuals.

Of course the 14th amendment doesn't mean this as the law currently does apply equally to all.

All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \n Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age,(See Note 15) and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n \n Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n \n Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n \n Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. \n \n \n\n \n As I read it there are group restrictions on voting, on counting for representation, and on serving in congress etc. There are absolutely NO restrictions on marriage, or on homosexuals who are citizens. And all citizens ARE guaranteed equal TREATMENT under the law. I do not see how this either supports or denies homosexual marriage in any way.\n \n \nRight, they saw people like me who think the people should govern themselves however they see fit. It is when you don't allow this that our government fails.\n\n \n Fortunately they did know people much like you and decided to rein you in with constitutional limitations to protect the nation against ill considered actions by the mob or majority. The structure is intended to serve as a barrier and a brake on such actions. That function is clearly still needed and appropriate.",

But if it were your nuts being hammered on the anvil of bigotry, you'd be screaming in outrage.\nNot only did they discriminate against gay Americans but also those that support polygamy.

This hardly makes a law just or not.\n \n \nWhat argument?\nDid you wish to respond to my suggestion that the 14th amendment equal protection clause does not mean equal treatment but equal protection and that the original meaning of the amendment was not to provide the same rights to everyone but to apply the law the same to everyone.\n \n\n Any government worth its salt exists to serve the people, not force them to conform to some arcane religious prejudice. If government wants people to govern themselves, then it should stop setting up obstacles in their path.\nBy govern themselves I hardly mean they have no laws in government and run their own ship but that the people of a local government, state, etc can decide how they want their government to run and what laws they will have. Once you start removing ideas from the democratic arena then you move towards a society run by the government and not one that serves the people. \n \n \nI thought you conservatives were supposed to be all for keeping the government off everyone's back, but I guess conservatives these days are all for government coercion.\nI simply believe in federalism...the way it was set up in 1792.",

However, if the status quo is perceived as unfair (if not to oneself personally, but to others), occasionally we are motivated by a sense of fairness, doing what it thought to be merely the right thing to do. Civil rights legislation was supported by some well off whites insulated in white suburbia who could perceive no change in the status quo with greater opportunities to blacks. \n \n Gay rights opponents paint the picture as though there is no problem with the status quo, gays are doing just fine. Gays are of course not in any way as oppressed as blacks have been (generally speaking, although specific instances are extreme unfairness are many). Gays are more easily portrayed as bad folks, perverts doing icky things because we look like everyone else and are invisible at times. It 's easy to judge \"others\" when the only thing you know about them is innuendo. Religion helps this a lot as well. \n \n In addition, the gay rights opponents portray gay rights advances as the death knell to god and apple pie and all that is right and holy. \n \n So to perceive unfairness, one has to know it exists. One also has to realize that resolution of that unfairness won't harm me at all.\n \n Occasionally people react out of a sense of fairness.",

   "The intent was perhaps not only directly related to slavery--- \n \n \nWhen the U.S. Constitution was ratified, only the states were empowered to deal with religion. However, in 1868, following the Civil War, the Constitution was amended so as to make the First Amendment, and in fact the first eight amendments, applicable to the various states. The Fourteenth Amendment contains the following statement: \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law....\"\n \n During the congressional discussion of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, the amendment's floor manager, Senator J. M. Howard (R-Mich.), stated in explaining it, that \"to these privileges and immunities . . . should be added the personal rights guaranteed and secured by the first eight amendments to the Constitution.\" He also said: \"The great object of the first section of the amendment is, therefore, to restrain the power of the states and compel them at all times to respect these fundamental guarantees.\"(18)\n \n In similar fashion, the House of Representatives understood that the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to make the Bill of Rights applicable to the states. Rep, John Bingham (R-Ohio), who was called by Justice Hugo Black \"the Madison of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" stated that the amendment was intended to overturn Barron v. Baltimore (1833), in which the Supreme Court had held that the Bill of Rights was not applicable to the states.(19)\n\n \n http://candst.tripod.com/14thamend.htm\n \n \n The 14th Amendment ensures substantive due process. The government must provide rational basis justification for a law and not impose unfairly on people's liberty.\n \n http://classes.lls.edu/archive/manheimk/114d3/echarts/sdp4.htm\n \n In Mass the right to same-sex marriage has been interpreted as covered by the 14th--\n \n \nFor decades, indeed centuries, in much of this country (including Massachusetts) no lawful marriage was possible between white and black Americans. That long history availed not when the Supreme Court of California held in 1948 that a legislative prohibition against interracial marriage violated the due process and equality guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, Perez v. Sharp, 32 Cal.2d 711, 728 (1948), or when, nineteen years later, the United States Supreme Court also held that a statutory bar to interracial marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967). [FN16] As both Perez and Loving make clear, the right to marry means little if it does not include the right to marry the person of one's choice, subject to appropriate government restrictions in the interests of public health, safety, and welfare. See Perez v. Sharp, supra at 717 (\"the essence of the right to marry is freedom to join in marriage with the person of one's choice\"). See also Loving v. Virginia, supra at 12. In this case, as in Perez and Loving, a statute deprives individuals of access to an institution of fundamental legal, personal, and social significance-the institution of marriage-because of a single trait: skin color in Perez and Loving, sexual orientation here. As it did in Perez and Loving, history must yield to a more fully developed understanding of the invidious quality of the discrimination. [FN17]\n\n http://www.msnbc.com/news/995055.asp?cp1=1 \n \n Jyoshu and Steeeve can use terms like \"loophole\" and \"judges are making it up\" to describe interpretations under law they don't like. However, in interpreting the Constitution, in using substantive due process, rational basis, judges are doing their job as a check and balance on the power of government. \n \n Jyoshu: How should it be more specific? What would your list of the \"people\" or rights covered specifically include? What protection for rights do those specified as not included or not specifically mentioned, I guess you mean gay people; have from government as gay people move from the margins into the mainstream of American society?",

I think the reason the amendment was worded in a very non-specific way was to ensure all PEOPLE were included; the problem is that they left 'due process' very open in terms of what it could entail. So open that it could be used to justify most anything with the sort of logic people are using toward the 14th these days. I'm of the opinion they wouldn't have intended it to be used to legalize such concepts as gay marriage. IMO marriage benefits of any kind (straight marriage too) shouldn't be guaranteed under auspices of the 14th amendment. Maybe some other way, but not under the 'due process' concept.",

I further asked whether or not it had something to do with the \"state interest\" convincing you (or someone). \n\n \n If you genuinely can't figure out why the differences -- and not just the legal ones -- between adults and children are of far greater significance when it comes to making adult decisions than the trivial differences between gays and straights, I really don't know where to begin.\n \n And yes, when you are contemplating making laws that adversely affect or discriminate against an entire group of citizens of a state, you had damn well better provide a good state interest in doing so. One is easily provided for dealing with immature children, but you and yours have never managed to provide one for discriminating against gays, outside your religion. (Which, BTW, I don't believe has any truth in it.\n \n \nYou say government like its a separate entity from the people....to me they are (well supposed to be) the same....a government of the people. So when the people want a government a certain way I support that as that it was democracy is. It seems your position is the one of either anarchy or dictatorship.\n\n \n Nope. It's one of individual human rights, which seems to be anathema to modern, statist conservatives. You folk want to crack your whip and have everyone march to your drummer. \n \n \nI don't think marriage is a human right. If it is then you are gonna have to explain how it is one.\n\n \n Because it is an integral part of human nature to form (or want to form) intimate, loving relationships with other individuals -- and as it turns out in fact, these individuals can be of either sex. You may not have a right to marry someone by force simply to be married, but you most certainly do have a basic human and constitutional (not enumerated) right to marry the consenting adult of your choice. Perhaps it isn't part of your nature, we are all different after all, but it is for the vast majority of people I've come across. The state isn't required by the Constitution to recognise marriages legally, but it would not be right for the state to ban them. If it does recognise them, then it should recognise the marriages of anyone eligible, and give excellent reasons (besides \"just because!) for not recognising those it decides cannot be regarded as legitimate. One can do that for marriage to or between children or very close relatives, but I've never seen any anti-gay activist manage this for gay marriage.\n \n \nI asked for evidence...do you have any?\n\n \n I've shown you evidence. You refuse to look because it offends your ideology. Actually, strike that -- I think it's self-evident. There is no such thing as unnatural nature.\n \n \nThat it has....are they the ones who determine if something is a basic human right? If true then they could just as easily remove this right.\n\n \n I think we determine human rights when we expand them. When we diminish them, then we are defining ourselves as tyrants. The US Constitution is predicated on the existence of basic human rights. you can deny them, but if you do, you might as well shred the Constitution and use it for compost. You are happy with a heterosexist majority keeping gays second class citizens because they want to. Years before, you would probably have been arguing against anti-slavery laws, the voting rights act, women's suffrage, and every extension of basic human rights into legal existence.\n \n \nTyranny would start when rules or laws are bent/manipulated/construed to deny citizens self-government. \n\n \n Nope. It ensues when one group of citizens seeks to deny another its basic rights, as the heterosexist majority is doing to the gay minority.\n \n \nunfair burden has nothing to do with the law applying equally to citizens.\n\n \n It has everything to do with it. You want a two-tier system with heterosexual on top and gays on the bottom. That's neither just nor constitutional.",

   "The issue isn't 'who' but 'what'. I think the reason the amendment was worded in a very non-specific way was to ensure all PEOPLE were included; the problem is that they left 'due process' very open in terms of what it could entail. So open that it could be used to justify most anything with the sort of logic people are using toward the 14th these days. I'm of the opinion they wouldn't have intended it to be used to legalize such concepts as gay marriage. IMO marriage benefits of any kind (straight marriage too) shouldn't be guaranteed under auspices of the 14th amendment. Maybe some other way, but not under the 'due process' concept.\n\n \n I'm sure the concept of gay marriage would have been completely foreign to the founders, if only because the concept of gay would have been foreign. Many in their day would have called it sodomy and hanged the perp or burned him at the state in the good Christian tradition.\n \n Our view is considerably more enlightened now, and we would be stupid to apply the founders' limited understanding (if they had any at all) of homosexuality to our day. We are in a position where we should treat gay Americans as equal in every way to straight Americans, because we realise the difference is not sufficient to permit just discrimination.\n \n The Constitution neither mandates, nor recognises, nor prohibits marriage. It does, however, spell out that all citizens should be treated equally under the laws. Just because the founders didn't know enough to see the fundamental equality between gays and straights, doesn't mean we should be equally blind today.",

Just because the founders didn't know enough to see the fundamental equality between gays and straights, doesn't mean we should be equally blind today.\n\n \n Then by your logic, we might as well be giving disability benefits to non-disabled people. Or social security benefits to 25-year-olds. What I'm saying has nothing to do with whether the founders understood homosexuality or not. I'm saying that, IMO, marriage is not a due process issue to begin with. Anymore than, say, a non-disabled person getting disability benefits would be a due process issue. The problem with the Monty-Hall view of the 14th Amendment and it's statements on due process is that it could be applied to anything, to the point of absurdity and meaninglessness.\n \n Your statement that the constitution intends that \"all citizens should be treated equally under the laws\" is fine, but you don't get to just ignore the \"under the laws\" part of that same statement. The laws don't allow for gay marriage. The law DOES allow for opposite-sex marriage (which really IS marriage, as far as the govt. is concerned), and so all citizens ARE allowed marriage in that way--the way that's \"under the laws.\" THAT'S why your strategy should be changing laws, not taking advantage of constitutional loopholes.",

   "Then by your logic, \n\n \n I don't know whose logic you are using, but it isn't mine.\n \n \nwe might as well be giving disability benefits to non-disabled people.\n\n \n Why? Disability benefits are granted to offset a person's sudden inability to earn a living through physical injury. The state isn't obliged to provide them, it could allow disabled people to starve in the streets instead, but it allocates them on the rational basis of disability. All disabled people qualify, irrespective of sexual orientation. (Correspondingly, all married people should be eligible for marital benefits if the state decides to provide them, not those irrationally selected on the basis of some arcane religious belief.)\n \n Where is the rational basis of allocating marital benefits to straight married couples, but not to gay married ones?\n \n I'll tell you, josh, it doesn't exist. \n \n \nWhat I'm saying has nothing to do with whether the founders understood homosexuality or not. \n\n \n I wholly agree that equal treatment under today's law has nothing whatever to do with the founders' understanding of homosexuality.\n \n \nI'm saying that, IMO, marriage is not a due process issue to begin with. \n\n \n The rights, protections, benefits and privileges associated with legal recognition of marriage are the issue. If the state wishes to declare one group of people eligible for them, but deny another very similar one, it does need to provide a good reason for doing it (and no, \"rational\" doesn't include counting functional penises and uteruses within a relationship).\n \n Once again, I ask what is the rational basis for discriminating against gay married couples while offering these rights, protections, benefits and privileges to straight ones? I've yet to see any that doesn't apeal to some anti-gay, religious tradition or other.\n \n It's perfectly easy to establish such a rational reason for supporting a benefit for the disabled, whether one likes it or not (maybe one feels the disabled don't deserve state charity and should just die on the streets), but I've never seen one that applies exclusively across the board for all straight couples but for no gay couples, and owes nothing to a discredited religious bias.",

   "Ok so equal protection can be denied if you can prove to a judge that there is a good reason for it (this is how I read your answer). \n\n \n Since the constitutionality of laws is determined by courts in the US, and not by legislatures (who would, let's face it, have an interest in finding any shenanigan they wanted to pull constitutional and consequently can't be trusted), then yes, they have to decide whether equal protections are being violated on a rational basis or not. A modern understanding of homosexuality means that they are being violated without good cause -- we don't have to appeal to the opinions of the founders on that. If you think they aren't, you are free to join those attempting to rewrite the Constitution to exclude gay Americans from equal protections where marriage laws are concerned. That's a first in US constitutional history, an attempt to restrict the rights of Americans to suit the religious whims and biases of a tyrannical majority.\n \n \nOk, where do these human rights come from and where does our constitution or laws guarantee them? It seems when you argue against voting on things then you are arguing against a democracy. Are you supporting a government that is a democracy (or representative democracy) or not? Or perhaps only in some cases (which would then not be a demoracy).\n\n \n Look no further than the DoI:\n \n \nWhen in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness....\n\n \n Irrespective of whether one is a believer, a deist (like many of the founders) or an atheist, the notion is crystal clear: human rights exist by virtue of our human nature, by virtue of being who we are. They are intrinsic to it, and must be assumed to be inviolable and inalienable. If we do not grant the truth of this axiom, even though it may be difficult or impossible to prove independently, dictatorship and tyranny follow as surely as night follows day. Life is better if we grant the truth of this axiom than if we willfully deny it to make some ideological point.\n \n \nFirst off there are no non-enumerated rights protected by the constitution. \n\n \n Nonsense. Human rights exist independently of the Constitution for us to discover through the operation of our consciences. The Constitution does protect them once they are discovered and generally accepted. We do NOT have to go exclusively by whatever the founders considered a human right, otherwise they wouldn't have passed the 9th Amendment. We have the right and obligation to come to our own conclusions. We have concluded that marriage is such a right, and more and more people are concluding that gay human beings possess it to the same degree as straight ones. Our understanding of human rights evolves and expands.\n \n \nSecondly, it seems illogical to go from \"its natural to form a relationship\" to \"therefore marriage is a right\". \n\n \n It is not illogical at all. It's a decision of conscience. If you have a right to be human, a right to feel as humans feel, and a right to act on it, then you have a right to form a partnership with the person you love and who loves you. We call this \"marriage\".\n \n \nYou can certainly have a relationship without marriage and you can have marriages that can hardly be called a relationship. This doesn't provide any evidence that marriage is 1) human nature and 2) it is a human right. \n\n \n A marriage can mean either that intimate and usually sexual partnership between two consenting human adults, or it can mean the legal recognition of such a partnership. I have used it in both the broad and narrow sense. When I talk of two gay people in a partnership being married, it's in the broader sense, and yes, they do have a human right to do that. They also have a human right, in the Western tradition that you seem keen to deny for present purposes, to have that relationship treated by state mariage laws the same way they treat the equivalent straight relationship.\n \n \nI further would ask do you think anything that is human nature is a human right? I'd hope the answer is no.\n\n \n As long as it harms no others, why not? Whom does gay marriage harm?\n \n \nObviously there are many people that have reasons for not supporting gay marriage.\n\n \n Sure they have reasons. Religious ones, not rational ones. However, the Constitution protects freedom of religion as well. If a religion marries a gay couple in its church, should not the state recognise that the same way it does for straight couples married in a church?\n \n \nThere is no one link or quote in your posts on this forum that support your view that justifiable evidence is needed for a law.\n\n \n Sorry, but the history of constitutional decisions shows that when laws are made that discriminate against the rights of some identifiable group of citizens while favouring others, a rational basis does have to be demonstrated. I don't have to list them in my own posts, all you need do is refer to the judgements of the US Supreme Court -- they apply various degrees of scrutiny to such discriminatory laws, and increasingly, they [courts] apply them to laws against gay marriage.\n \n \nThe fallacies in this post aside, are you saying human right are created when we say something is a human right?\n\n \n Who else is going to define human nature except humans? Your god? I rather doubt it. \n \n \nSo for example if we decided that betting on dog fighting was a human right then it would be so and to remove this would make us \"tyrants\"? Better yet, did the making slavery illegal remove a human right making us tyrants? \n\n \n Making slavery illegal is equivalent to making the banning of gay marriage illegal. It extends human rights to more groups and individuals, and does not curtail them. Hence it is not tyrannical, it extends freedom. And how about the rights of dogs? Do they count for nothing in your worldview? A dog has rights based on its animal nature, too. They mayn't all be the same as human rights, but surely they include the right to freedom from wanton cruelty.\n \n \nOf course you still need to say where these human rights come from...because if they come from expanding them as you suggested in the above quote then there is no denial as homosexual marriage has never been legal and therefore could not be a \"right\" yet. I of course disagree this is where rights come from.\n\n \n I've explained yet again where human rights come from, and yes, by virtue of that source, American society has long denied an important right for gay people, namely their right to form intimate same-sex relationships. that always has been a human right, it just took a long time for people to realise it. \n \n \nYou can claim its unjust but it certainly is constitutional. Homosexuals aren't the only groups who are burdened by marriage restrictions but once again non-equality is ok there because a good enough reason means the undo burden is ok....which actually contradicts what you just said but really is the only logical conclusion one could come to with your stance here.\n\n \n They are the only group unfairly burdened by anti-homosexual laws. The law does not treat us equally, and that's a fact no amount of bland denial can conceal. There is no logic to your stance, because like Phyllis, you refuse to see the wood for the trees.",

   "To elaborate very briefly on that, the writers of the DoI and Constitution essentially appealed to a form of Natural Law argument in which to embed their claim that inalienable human rights exist, and hence that they can be infringed by tyrannical governments (whether or not those governments are democratic or monarchic in form). \n \n They couldn't really justify their claim that \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" are inalienable rights (rights that we see today as beyond the ability of any majority to vote away); they merely accepted them as true, natural axioms on which to base a decent society and government, because the alternative was (and still remains) to court tragedy and tyranny.\n \n That's still true today. If we deny the validity of inalienable and universal human rights, we get Hitler, Stalin and the Inquisition. If we can live without human rights, then we will probably have to live with tyranny.\n \n Steve complains that there is no basis for these human rights. The founders used interesting phrases such as \"Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\" (which gave the lie to their deist sympathies and their source in the Enlightenment) to justify their view of natural human rights. Maybe these claims cannot be justified independently as Absolute Truths that are beyond all possibility of questioning, but are merely necessary conditions for a society that most people would be content to live in, a society that doesn't deliberately go out of its way to create unhappiness. \n \n If so, what is wrong with that? \n \n If one is determined in pursuit of some anti-gay rights agenda to question the right to marry the person one loves as a basic human right, then one might as well question and deny every single human right. One might as well just accept living under the tyranny of the strongest as the natural human condition. The founders stood against this depressing view of life, and so do I. They wouldn't have instantly understood gay marriage, but they would have understood the drive for liberty and happiness that underlies it.",

In fact, to think they are in the constitution simply violates the amendment.\n \n \nWe have the right and obligation to come to our own conclusions.

Apparently the only thing I can gather from your posts is that (ironically) the majority determines when something is a right.\n \n \nAs long as it harms no others, why not? Whom does gay marriage harm?\nHaha, so prostitution is a human right. Using drugs, seemingly a human right. In fact most everything is now a human right. Interesting but certainly makes no sense and given your stance on the role of a judge it is very disturbing. Talk about a monarchy type control.\n \n \nSure they have reasons. Religious ones, not rational ones. However, the Constitution protects freedom of religion as well. If a religion marries a gay couple in its church, should not the state recognise that the same way it does for straight couples married in a church?\nTo answer your question, no. And freedom of religion has nothing to do with how one is allowed to think and believe in terms of government laws. Funny you say it is not a \"rational\" reason to have a religious belief. Is it rational to just say we have human rights because we do and marriage is one of them because it is? Seems that is taken on pure faith as well. \n \n \nSorry, but the history of constitutional decisions shows that when laws are made that discriminate against the rights of some identifiable group of citizens while favouring others, a rational basis does have to be demonstrated.

Substantive due process and the \"living constitution\" have no basis in the constitution, our founding fathers image, or any law.\n \n \nWho else is going to define human nature except humans? Your god? I rather doubt it. \nI would say God but at the same time we have a democracy so we vote on these things.\n \n\n Making slavery illegal is equivalent to making the banning of gay marriage illegal. It extends human rights to more groups and individuals, and does not curtail them. Hence it is not tyrannical, it extends freedom.\n So every time you remove a restriction it is freedom. I suppose if we remove all the laws it would be wonderful! You argue for anarchy.\n \n \nI've explained yet again where human rights come from\nFrom a majority apparently. I find that very humerous.\n \n \nand yes, by virtue of that source, American society has long denied an important right for gay people, namely their right to form intimate same-sex relationships. that always has been a human right, it just took a long time for people to realise it. \nHow can it have always been a human right if humans are the ones that create these rights? It makes no sense to say something exists when the person you say makes it exists never made it so! I suppose polygamy is a human right but we just don't know it yet. Perhaps one day...\n \n \nThey are the only group unfairly burdened by anti-homosexual laws.\n There is no anti-homosexual law. A law defining marriage as one man one woman actually burdens the group of homosexuals and those who support polygamy. \n \n \nThe law does not treat us equally, and that's a fact no amount of bland denial can conceal.

   "Ok, well if all you have to do is convince a judge its a good idea then you shouldn't have a procedual problem with a president appointing otherwise non-qualified mega-republicans to the courts in order who don't wish to apply the law but provide their opinion on what is or isn't a good idea. \n\n \n It would be nice to have a president competent enough to appoint anyone. May I remind you that such appointments also require the advice and consent of the legislature? Not that that's been worth much in GOP hands, either.\n \n \nWell at least we agree that the Creator gives rights. \n\n \n No, we don't. We agree that human rights are intrinsic to the state of being human. BTW, your notion of your \"Creator\" is not necessarily the founders', still less is it mine.\n \n \nTell me, where does the Creator grant you marriage? Anything supporting this or is it just a belief?\n\n \n The fact that I am human and experience all the feelings humans experience gives me the right to seek and enter into a marriage. Your view of the Creator has nothing to do with that, as my rights exist whether or not your Creator does, and irrespective of any claims you make about said Creator.\n \n \nObviously homosexual marriage is not thought of as a right (or marriage for some) so it seems only fitting that in a dispute we do the democratic thing. If not then it seems the one causing tyranny is you.\n\n \n Obviously you refuse to consider marriage a right in order to promote the tyranny of a homophobic majority over gay people. \n \n \nUnder the \"accept natural law\" provision of the bill of rights?\n\n \n Actually, it's the Declaration of Independence that invokes natural rights. It's a pity the GOP have unilaterally dcecided to ignore the concept, but then, they would have been on the side of King george as representing the rule of authority.\n \n \nAll the 9th amendment says is that the constitution can't be used as a reason for denying other rights. That hardly is a protection of these rights within the constitution. In fact, to think they are in the constitution simply violates the amendment.\n\n \n Nope. It means that government may not violate such rights. Else why bother mentioning them in the first place? The Constitution exists to establish and limit the powers of government. It doesn't have the power to single out gay Americans for discriminatory legislation.\n \n \nSeems we do have a system for deciding this matter though...via a vote.\n\n \n GOP supporters have the right to seek to amend the Constitution by excluding gays from its protections. I wouldn't care to live in the tyranny that would ensue. \n \n The simplest definition of \"democracy\" is mob rule. The United States is not, in fact, a democracy, it's a constitutional republic with a democratically elected legislature, and an appointed presidency -- you have heard of the Electoral College, I resume?\n \n \nCivil marriage is simply a recognition by government of a type of partnership. \n\n \n Well, at least there is something we can agree on. Pity we can't agree that gay citizens deserve the same rights as straight ones.\n \n \nI also like how you apply to the \"decision of the conscience\"...also known as a majority. Weren't you just saying how the majority shouldn't determine rights?\n\n \n They can state their opinion, and if they have the power, they can deny rights by brute force and tyranny. But they don't make or confer them. Rights exist irrespective of the opinion of the majority. \n \n \nAgain this doesn't speak to any evidence that it is a natural/human right. Apparently the only thing I can gather from your posts is that (ironically) the majority determines when something is a right.\n\n \n Nope. that's your argument, not mine.\n \n \nHaha, so prostitution is a human right. Using drugs, seemingly a human right. In fact most everything is now a human right. Interesting but certainly makes no sense and given your stance on the role of a judge it is very disturbing. Talk about a monarchy type control.\n\n \n Of course these are rights, so long as they cause no harm to others. Once again, you are the one ardently advocating tyranny over liberty. But then, that's par for the course for right wingers these days. Liberty is not a value they recognise. \n \n \nThere is no anti-homosexual law. A law defining marriage as one man one woman actually burdens the group of homosexuals and those who support polygamy.\n\n \n The laws exist solely to deny gay Americans equal rights. \n \n \nI don't deny non-equal treatment. I deny a violation of the 14th amendment.\n\n \n Denial of the truth doesn't make you right. It just makes you a denialist.",

It means that government may not violate such rights. Else why bother mentioning them in the first place? The Constitution exists to establish and limit the powers of government. It doesn't have the power to single out gay Americans for discriminatory legislation.\n \nIt is to preserve federalism and I am confused on how you could see if any other way. People toss around unenumerated like its in there but enumeration is only used in the amendment to indicate what the amendment is referring to. \n \n The list of rights in the constitution cannot be used (construed) to deny or disparage those retained by the people. The rights in the constitution are generally the bill of rights (1-8 amendments) with a few more thrown in in the original constitution. So those rights (very specific) cannot be given meaning that they don't have (oddly enough this is support against a living constitution) in order for the federal government to assume power it doesn't have and deny rights the people currently have. \n \n Now this tells us a few things. One, there are rights outside the constitution (this is obvious given the 10th amendment). Two, you are supposed to manipulate the constitution to gain more federal power. \n \n So tell me, how is that not a federalism amendment? It clearly tries to limit power of the federal government. It certainly does not claim constitutionally protected rights as the constitution doesn't claim to protect all rights. The 10th amendment (which was actually part of the 9th in the beginning) shows us where these rights are created and who retains them. A government right is referred to as a \"power\". \n \n So there is a brief explanation of the 9th amendment. I'd be happy to show the insane amount of proof to support this if you like (although Foundit has already found that I know what I'm talking about with regards to the 9th amendment so read that thread).\n \n \n\n GOP supporters have the right to seek to amend the Constitution by excluding gays from its protections. I wouldn't care to live in the tyranny that would ensue. \nThere really is no need to do that if judges do what they are supposed to. I personally don't support a federal constitutional amendment as this issue is better left to the states.\n \n\n The simplest definition of \"democracy\" is mob rule. The United States is not, in fact, a democracy, it's a constitutional republic with a democratically elected legislature, and an appointed presidency -- you have heard of the Electoral College, I resume?(sic)\nPerhaps we should go back to an appointed president and senate. And yes, no need to patronize me.\n \n \nWell, at least there is something we can agree on. Pity we can't agree that gay citizens deserve the same rights as straight ones.\nWell my point to that is there are relationships outside of marriage that are not recognized by the government and I certainly don't think that a government recognizing a certain type of relationship is a right (at least a natural right....I am fully aware civil marriage is a government right for straights).\n \n\n They can state their opinion, and if they have the power, they can deny rights by brute force and tyranny. But they don't make or confer them. Rights exist irrespective of the opinion of the majority. \nThen where do rights come from. In this post it seems you suggest that they are inherent. This seems rather arbitrary unless you are willing to say its from God or some religion. If you say \"nature\" then not only is that essentially a religion but what makes you feel your beliefs are above others? Seems the solution to this little problem in our society is to vote on it. \n \n \nNope. that's your argument, not mine.\nThen please explain where these rights come from without using the phrase \"consensus of people\". \n \n \nOf course these are rights, so long as they cause no harm to others. Once again, you are the one ardently advocating tyranny over liberty. But then, that's par for the course for right wingers these days. Liberty is not a value they recognize. \nLike I said, there is not greater liberty than to be able to have a government by the people for the people. But since everything is a right now...and apparently you can restrict it to \"no harm\" for some unexplained reason...then explain how this works with our constitution and country? Further explain how government by the people is not a right.\n \n \nThe laws exist solely to deny gay Americans equal rights. \nNo, it denies anyone who is not one man and one woman and wants to marry \"equal rights\" (term in quotes since I deny its a violation of equal rights).\n \n \nDenial of the truth doesn't make you right. It just makes you a denialist.\nWell you certainly haven't proven the 14th amendment means what you think it means. Even in the Lawrence case the courts denied the 14th amendment equal protection argument (they used due process clause incorrectly instead). But assuming they did use the equal protection clause they would still be using it with a meaning not originally given to the amendment which is dishonest and flat out wrong.",

   "That didn't answer my question about whether you would be ok with judges being appointed who just give their opinion on whether something is good or bad. After all, this is the role of a judge you seem to like.\n\n \n I like my judges to support the rights of the common man against a tyrannical government. Your mileage apparently varies.\n \n \nSeems very clear they referred to a God. \n\n \n It may seem clear to you, because of your belief in a \"God\". However, many of them, including the principal author, T. Jefferson, were deists. Jefferson even rewrote the bible. I don't think he had a view of god that was identical to yours.\n \n \nAnd yes I agree human rights are intrinsic to a human being \n\n \n Thank heavens we agree on something.\n \n \nwhich is one reason I don't support abortion.\n\n \n Yawn. I don't care. For what it's worth, a bunch of cells does not a human being make. \n \n \nfeelings don't equate to rights.\n\n \n However, being and feeling human equates to having rights. Let me know how zygotes feel, and I'll tell you what rights they have. emoticon_cool \n \n \nCivil marriage is not a human right.\n\n \n Sez you. Somehow, I get the feeling that with you, human rights begin at conception and end at birth. \n \n \nThe DoI has no authority in our legal system but I will grant you that it is a good indication of our mission statement.\n\n \n Then by all means pay more attention to it than you have done. \n \n \nThe list of rights in the constitution cannot be used (construed) to deny or disparage those retained by the people. \n\n \n And marriage is a right retained by the people, irrespective of anything else. Since gays are human beings, they have the same rights you do, and if the government wishes to legislate your marriages, it is obligated to treat gay citizens equally.\n \n \nPerhaps we should go back to an appointed president and senate. \n\n \n The presidency has always been appointed. It certainly isn't decided by democratic vote today. BTW, were you up in arms against the \"judicial activism\" that awarded the 2000 \"election\" to George Bush? Somehow, I suspect that was activism you warmly approved of. As for an appointed senate, it could hardly function more corruptly than the institution did in GOP hands. Not that it has improved much since.\n \n \nWell my point to that is there are relationships outside of marriage that are not recognized by the government and I certainly don't think that a government recognizing a certain type of relationship is a right (at least a natural right....I am fully aware civil marriage is a government right for straights).\n\n \n Well, that's besides the point. There is nothing in the Constitution that mandates any regulation or recognition of marriage by the government. However, once government decides to interfere, then it is obliged to do so without prejudice against hated minorities.\n \n \nThen where do rights come from.\n\n \n I've told you. They come from our humanity, however difficult that may be for right wing religious believers to grasp.\n \n \nIn this post it seems you suggest that they are inherent. This seems rather arbitrary unless you are willing to say its from God or some religion. If you say \"nature\" then not only is that essentially a religion but what makes you feel your beliefs are above others? Seems the solution to this little problem in our society is to vote on it. \n\n \n It's not arbitrary at all. It's utilitarian. It's a necessary axiom if we are to have a society where people are going to be free to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. You can in practice vote those rights away if you have the brute force to enforce such tyranny (though this negates every ethical principle about freedom of self-determination), but then you will no longer have a free society, you will have mob rule. That's what your sort of unrestrained democracy is: mob rule. It's what the Constitution was written to prevent.\n \n \nLike I said, there is not greater liberty than to be able to have a government by the people for the people. \n\n \n This means nothing nless it is all the people, which means that minorities cannot be ignored whenever it suits the majority to abrogate their inherent human rights.\n \n \nBut since everything is a right now...and apparently you can restrict it to \"no harm\" for some unexplained reason...then explain how this works with our constitution and country? Further explain how government by the people is not a right.\n\n \n By ALL the people, remember? Democracy is not carte blanche for tyranny of the majority. That's mob rule you advocate there, mate. We have rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, but you would throw up obstacles in the path of gay Americans as they pursue those rights.",

   "You've summed it up nicely. We agree that rights exist because life would be intolerable if we said they didn't. If they didn't, as the American neoconservatives argue, then anyone could do anything to anyone else. If rights don't exist, they can't be violated, which suits conservatives these days very nicely.\n \n In any case, better a utilitarian appeal to pragmatic effects than mystically appealing to rights endowed by some invisible, bearded old man in the sky, who by some curious coincidence always exactly reflects the moral values the appealer happens to support.\n \n Follow that?\n\n You seem to think you are wiser than the founders. I cannot claim to posses such wisdom. When I look at it (and I have very closely) I happen to agree with the founders' justification for rights as I think it is the only justification that obliges me to treat you the way you ought to be treated.\n \n For what it's worth, the founders did not embrace John Stuart Mill's moral philosophy. Nor did they embrace utilitarianism in general. Nor does anyone really embrace utilitarianism. Following utilitarianism faithfully would lead one to maintain that he ought to kill 49 people if that is what would bring the greatest good to the remaining 50 people.\n \n \nI see, Phyllis. So human rights are whatever your god decrees they are. But since your god is merely a projection of your biases on to reality, where does that leave the rest of us who don't share your religious biases? You claim:\n\n It would leave them in a rather good position I would think. For example, even if someone does not share my religious beliefs, I nevertheless know that they have rights. Even if someone does not believe they have inherent intrinsic value and rights, I nevertheless say that they do, and will treat them accordingly. It leaves me saying that even if someone vehemently opposes my religious views (or any other views), they nevertheless have value, and thus they deserve to have the opportunity to participate in the political processes. I do not need to spread a noble lie to order society. Neither did the framers. The truth of the matter seems to work just dandy.\n \n \nHow does this differ from anyone else's claim? After all, you are the mouthpiece for your god; your god says whatever it is you want it to say. You are your god's interpreter, and the rest of us should just tug our forelocks and go along with you. You are no less a moral relativist than anyone else; the only difference is you dignify your relativism with the claim your god ordained it. The rest of us are more modest.\n\n Of the many things that could judiciously be said about me, an affirmation of moral relativism is not one of them. There are right answers to moral questions. That is not moral relativism; it is, in fact, moral absolutism. Now, I of course might be wrong about some of the things I believe. But I could only be wrong if there is actually a right. Therefore, you would be mistaken if you thought that I believed the way I do for any other reason than I think it to be true.\n \n \nWithout a deity, you claim, we are left only with human preferences. But then, your claims about your preferred divinity only reflect human preferences. So either way, we are left with human assertions of human rights. Your appeal to the absolute decrees of some hypothetical and mythological deity carry no more weight than a rationalist's appeal to human nature and utilitarianism, only utilitarianism is more objective. They are only what you claim they are.\n\n Your suggestion that utilitarian philosophy is objective is an interesting one indeed. It is far from objective. It relies on subjective understandings of what is the \"greatest good,\" and what the \"greatest number\" actually is.\n \n Regardless of any of the foregoing, I think this brings out an important point. People obviously disagree about rights. We have a mechanism in place for resolving these disputes. Hence, you and I can vote however we wish, and I would accept the consequences. However, when someone or some group tries to influence that process in such a way as to deem it inconsequential, I will be vehemently opposed to it.",

Utilitarianism, however, is a better foundation for a moral philosophy than an arbitrary appeal to an elderly invisible bearded white guy in the sky who smites sinners for fun. It's not sufficient, but it's a good place to start.\n \n (Just out of curiosity, if you had a forced choice of causing 49 people out of a hundred to die, or letting all 100 die, which would you choose? Yours is really a contrived example. Why would a utilitarian feel he had to kill 49 people to benefit 51, unless it were somehow a forced choice without other options? And why would a utilitarian feel he had a perfect analysis of the problem at hand? And didn't your god command the slaughter of tens of thousands over and over again?)\n \n \nIt would leave them in a rather good position I would think.

Therefore, you would be mistaken if you thought that I believed the way I do for any other reason than I think it to be true.\n\n \n You could be wrong even if there isn't a right. Sometimes, there are no right answers to a moral question, and all practical answers have something wrong with them. (Suppose you and your friends are hiding from the Nazis, and you have a distressed baby who needs to be kept quiet to prevent the Nazis from finding and killing you all. All you can do is block the baby's mouth and nose to stop it from making a sound. Is there a right answer to such a dilemma?) You appeal to the moral absolutes you claim have been handed down by that invisible bearded elderly white guy in the sky, but can you show him to me? And can he answer all moral dilemmas?\n \n Of course you are a moral relativist; you just fall into the class of relativists who refuse to admit their relativism. Like everyone else, you base your moral judgements on a combination of intuition and training. You attribute them to your guy in the sky because that gives them greater authority, but many of them are nevertheless arbitrary constructs created by the society you live in, to suit the society you live in. You approve of them because it hasn't occurred to you there could be a better system. Your society has created the construct that gay sex is a sin, but you can't provide me with a single rational reason it's immoral, just your appeal to your guy in the sky. You believe, but you can't explain it rationally.\n \n \nYour suggestion that utilitarian philosophy is objective is an interesting one indeed. It is far from objective. It relies on subjective understandings of what is the \"greatest good,\" and what the \"greatest number\" actually is.\n\n \n Fine, so you claim that utilitarianism is based on subjective notions of what is good. But those notions are based on a vast reservoir of human experience. We have a pretty good notion of what is good or not, and liberty, fairness and equality, we have decided, are good. Your notions are far more subjective, because they rely on your projections of your intuitions on your guy in the sky. You don't even consider the social and personal consequences of enforcing such edicts, whereas utilitarians do.\n \n Utilitarianism may have a subjective component, but unlike your morality, it does consider the real world consequences of human actions.

We have a mechanism in place for resolving these disputes. Hence, you and I can vote however we wish, and I would accept the consequences. However, when someone or some group tries to influence that process in such a way as to deem it inconsequential, I will be vehemently opposed to it.\n\n \n Unfortunately, I do not accept that you have a right to force a morality I find utterly repugnant on me by majority vote. I am vehemently opposed to the tyranny you advocate. Gay marriage, on the other hand, forces nothing on you. No-one is compelling you to divorce your husband and enter a lesbian marriage. Gay marriage affects you not one whit.\n \n However, your moralistic stance against gay marriage affects every gay American adversely. Not that you care about justice and equality... it's all just a legal game to you, because none of your rights are on the chopping block.",

   "Consequences like gays getting rights? \n\n \n Well, historically, gays being deprived of rights has been the consequence of religion.\n \n \nAgain, remember, for some religion IS their basis for fighting the same fight you do. I guess it's a good thing ML King didn't abandon his religious beliefs, since he made it clear it was the driving force behind his beliefs about equality. You're problem is that you think your enemy is religion, rather than what it really is, which is intolerance. They are not the same concept.\n\n \n Well, they are entitled to their own rationalisation of why they fight for justice. I think it's because they think justice is a good idea, and so, in my view, they reinterpret their religion in the light of justice as being a good in itself. It's not that their religion mandates equal rights for anyone, slaves, blacks, women or gays -- quite the contrary. In fact, their religion has most often been quoted in support of injustice, as in South African apartheid.\n \n As for my enemy being intolerance rather than religion, per se, this is true. Many religious beliefs make a totem of tolerance for non-believers. However, I can't help but notice that institutionalised religion often leads to intolerance in practice.\n \n \nThis is not true. There certainly ARE people who base their perspective on human rights--in their case including gay rights--on Jesus' teachings and NOT the \"enlightenment\". And for that matter, the enlightenment as a period of time was little more (if any) friendly to gays than history was previously.\n\n \n As I said, they are entitled to their own rationalisation which I do not have to agree with, but I have often heard zealous religious believers quoting Jesus in support of their intolerant beliefs -- often ranting obsessively during gay pride marches where they were heard in silence but not harassed. And while the years of the Enlightenment itself weren't friendly to gays, the principles that it laid down and which in post-Enlightenment years bore fruit in the emancipation of Catholics, slaves and eventually women have also led to the emancipation of gays. Planted seeds do not bear fruit instantly. One has to wait and nurture them.\n \n It's certainly true that some religious believers do say their support of equal rights for gays is based on their religious beliefs.

   "I've been leafing through a free online publication by Robert Altemeyer linked on the NYT forum about authoritarians:\n \n The Authoritarians\n \n While I do read it with reservations -- its \"right-wing authoritarian\" (RWA) index is reminiscent of IQ scoring, so i do have reservations about potential oversimplification -- I think it does have some good insights and descriptions of the \"typical\" right-wing authoritarian mindset. \n \n That isn't to claim all right-wingers think exactly the same way on every issue, nor that there aren't authoritarian left-wingers (who are really just the mirror image of right-wingers -- the extreme arms meet on the other side of the circle). However, people who score low on the RWA scale are considerably more flexible and less judgemental than people who score high, and people's attitudes on many specific political and social issues (e.g. abortion, gay marriage, death penalty, war, etc.) can be fairly well predicted from their RWA score. (It all depends on where the leaders, religious or secular, high scorers regard as authorities stand on an issue. They are less likely to consider an issue on its intrinsic merits, and more likely to rationalise gut support for a status quo position supported by their authorities.)\n \n I think the yen for authority is innate (leaving it open how much of it is hereditary and how much experiential but involuntary), though many of us score well below average on the RWA scale (e.g. me -- I scored 30 on the 0-200 RWA scale of a typical test provided in the book, the population average being about 90). But so is the craving for religious certainty and security, and i think they are probably fairly closely related, or at least may have roots in the same psychological foundations. How much sense it makes to separate religiosity from authoritarianism depends, I suppose, on the context. They often appear harnessed together, and there must be a good reason for that.",

   "I like my judges to support the rights of the common man against a tyrannical government. Your mileage apparently varies.\n I prefer one that follows our laws. So yes, very different.\n \n\n And marriage is a right retained by the people, irrespective of anything else. Since gays are human beings, they have the same rights you do, and if the government wishes to legislate your marriages, it is obligated to treat gay citizens equally.\nEven if marriage is a right retained by the people this doesn't mean its a constitutional right or a constitutionally protected right. Like I said there are no unenumerated rights protected by the constitution.\n \n \nThe presidency has always been appointed. It certainly isn't decided by democratic vote today. BTW, were you up in arms against the \"judicial activism\" that awarded the 2000 \"election\" to George Bush? Somehow, I suspect that was activism you warmly approved of. As for an appointed senate, it could hardly function more corruptly than the institution did in GOP hands. Not that it has improved much since.\nI'm not against activism...I want my judges to actively do what they are supposed to do.\n \n \nWell, that's besides the point. There is nothing in the Constitution that mandates any regulation or recognition of marriage by the government. However, once government decides to interfere, then it is obliged to do so without prejudice against hated minorities.\n \nThen whats the problem? There is no prejudice in our current laws.\n \n \nI've told you. They come from our humanity, however difficult that may be for right wing religious believers to grasp.\nWhat do you mean \"comes from humanity\"? Do you mean accepted by more people than not?\n \n \nIt's not arbitrary at all. It's utilitarian\nWhich is not only arbitrary but not a foundation for rights....it presupposes rights.\n \n \n It's a necessary axiom if we are to have a society where people are going to be free to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. You can in practice vote those rights away if you have the brute force to enforce such tyranny (though this negates every ethical principle about freedom of self-determination), but then you will no longer have a free society, you will have mob rule. That's what your sort of unrestrained democracy is: mob rule. It's what the Constitution was written to prevent.\nThe greatest good for the greatest amount of people is by definition a mob rule.

If they are just nature then I'd say I disagree with you and the only way to solve that is to vote on it.\n \n \nBy ALL the people, remember? Democracy is not carte blanche for tyranny of the majority. That's mob rule you advocate there, mate. We have rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, but you would throw up obstacles in the path of gay Americans as they pursue those rights.\nactually you have a right to life, liberty, and property guaranteed by our constitution but all three of those can be taken away and are not absolute.

Children and adults are not legal equals and never could be, because children aren't mentally mature to make decisions for themselves. Gay and straight adults certainly are equals, and it behoves government to finally treat them that way.\n \n Me: \"Still didn't answer my question. I didn't ask about the legal status of child and adults...I know they are not equal in view of the law but neither are homosexuals and straights (thus this argument). My question is why equal protection applies in one case but not the other. I further asked whether or not it had something to do with the \"state interest\" convincing you (or someone).\"\n \n Lesz: \"I did, but you just didn't like the answer. The answer you want is not always the right one.\"\n \n This was a good one because you really never answered the question directly. I went on to ask if your reason had something to do with a \"convincing state interest\" and you still wouldn't answer that.\n \n Later you answered it this way: \"then yes, they have to decide whether equal protections are being violated on a rational basis or not.\" Referring to judges but still provide no evidence that this is what is required under the meaning of the amendment. Of course I asked the only logical question afterwards which was if you only have to convince a judge its a good idea then shouldn't you just appoint judges that agree with your position (political judges in other words). Your response was \"It would be nice to have a president competent enough to appoint anyone. May I remind you that such appointments also require the advice and consent of the legislature?\" Which makes no sense and certainly doesn't answer the question. I informed you that you once again failed to answer the question and your response was \"I like my judges to support the rights of the common man against a tyrannical government.\" This of course narrows down your view of judges to mean they should only do what you want them to do and nothing more (and odd view). You then ended the conversation after my response without ever resolving how a judge should act and what evidence you have that it was the method set up by our constitution (which it is not). \n \n Other examples are your lack of evidence showing the 9th amendment means what you think it means. This is not a surprise considering it is illogical based on just reading the amendment and there is no evidence to support your position but an incredible amount to support mine. You also failed to provide any evidence that the 14th amendment equal protection clause means what you think it means...not even a court case which you can find (although I would say those are wrong as evidenced by at least the Lawrence case).\n \n You still never explained where rights come from other than a 100% majority which is a little confusing. Furthermore you didn't explain how, if you think rights just exist my nature, how we decide to accept your view on that over mine or someone elses. Apparently voting is not an acceptable way to do this but you didn't provide a better one. I could assume you that just think you should be dictator but that would be odd.\n \n I could go on but you certainly didn't provide any evidence I asked for and failed to make a reasoned argument on numerous occasions.

Can you explain how on earth an amendment that reads as follows could mean the rights are protected by the constitution:\n \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\n Seriously, unless you are willing to say that elsewhere in the constitution it says \"any right is protected by the constitution\" then this amendment can mean nothing more than a federalism protection. I'm asking for evidence here or please take me up on the debate challenge. \n \n A simple reading of the amendment would lead to a different result from what you say (granted I don't support a simple reading as evidence). You could say \"listed rights in the constitution cannot be used to deny rights that the people have\". You can't use X to deny Y....that's it...nothing more. Nothing about the constitution protecting Y, nothing about not being able to legislate Y. The irony is that you are construing the 9th amendment to deny people the right to self government! \n \n Its a federalist amendment! James Madison talked about this numerous times including his speech before the bank...early judges have read it like I do and pretty much no one ever thought it meant the constitution had protected rights not listed. \n \n \nThe courts have have a considerable, if not unanimous history of agreeing with gay plaintiffs here. Some day soon, that wall of anti-gay intransigence separating gay Americans from equal protections is going to get knocked down for good.\nOn what? Equal protection? Hardly, Lawrence v. Texas only had 1 person think equal protection applied (and that one is now gone and even stated it doesn't apply to marriage). Maryland just denied marriage for gays rejecting equal protection. Furthermore the 9th amendment argument you bring up has never worked and is considered ridiculous by most.",

   "I can give some further explanation of the 9th amendment here:\n \n\n But most important, although retained rights may be individual or collective, the Ninth always guards the people's collective right to control the particular matter on a state level. For example, suppose one of the retained rights of the people is the right of self-defense. Should the federal government attempt to deny or disparage this right because it is not specifically enumerated, this would violate the Ninth Amendment. As a retained individual right, it would be left to the people of each state to determine how and when the right to self-defense would (or would not) be regulated. Although one might argue that the principles of natural law preclude denying the right even on a state level, this would be a matter for state courts to decide and, ultimately, the people of each individual state.\n \n Suppose, on the other hand, that the federal government in 1792 decided that the right to self-defense was a natural right and that states were not adequately protecting this fundamental right. Accordingly, Congress passes the \"Federal Self Defense Act\" requiring states to protect to the individual right of selfdefense. Unless the law is a necessary and proper means for advancing an enumerated federal responsibility, the Act would violate the reserved powers of the states as guaranteed by the Tenth Amendment. All powers not delegated (or prohibited) are reserved to the states. This is true even if one accepts the proposition that the personal right to self-defense is a retained natural right of the people. In this way, a retained right might be individual in nature but collective in terms of the combined effect of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. Although later constitutional amendments (such as the Fourteenth) may limit the category of rights left to state majoritarian control, this does not change the operative effect (much less original purpose) of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.\n\n \n \nIt has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would\n disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration, and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the general government, and were consequently insecure.\nDoesn't get any clearer than this. The 9th amendment was made so those rights not listed aren't assumed to be subject to federal jurisdiction (aka general government).",

Gay couples have identical interests in marriage laws to straight couples. It's either one law for all, or no law for anyone. \n \n As for the 9th amendment, it reads:\n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n Cornell University Law School has a handy-dandy website to explain the Constitution, with annotations on all of the articles and amendments. Here are the annotations on the 9th:\n \n RIGHTS RETAINED BY THE PEOPLE\n \n It starts:\n \n \nAside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those.1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. \"It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.\"2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas[p.1504]not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement.3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions.\n\n \n It limits the power of government to take away people's rights. That is its function. That was intended to be its function. Government does not have the constitutional power to abridge the rights of gay Americans by a simple law. Not even by referendum. (See Romer v. Evans)\n \n Get used to it. The protections that guard the rights of gay Americans against the whim of a tyrannical majority are the same ones that guard your rights. Knock (or vote) ours away, and you will rapidly find you no longer have any rights yourself.\n \n Of course, as you are an advocate of government power over individual liberty, perhaps that wouldn't matter to you.",

You can't construe this amendment to mean \"because we can't use the listed rights to deny other rights those other rights are therefore constitutional rights protected with the same authority\".

Simply put I said it would not take any right away if done in a legitimate way but if done by willful judges it would take away a right of self government.\n\n \n Courts have recognised a right to marry. If that doesn't apply to gay people, then that is carving them out from the equal protection of the law.\n \n You really need to read Romer v. Evans:\n \n \n Held:\n \n Amendment 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 4-14.\n \n (a) The State's principal argument that Amendment 2 puts gays and lesbians in the same position as all other persons by denying them special rights is rejected as implausible. The extent of the change in legal status effected by this law is evident from the authoritative construction of Colorado's Supreme Court - which establishes that the amendment's immediate effect is to repeal all existing statutes, regulations, ordinances, and policies of state and local entities barring discrimination based on sexual orientation, and that its ultimate effect is to prohibit any governmental entity from adopting similar, or more protective, measures in the future absent state constitutional amendment - and from a review of the terms, structure, Page II and operation of the ordinances that would be repealsed and prohibited by Amendment 2. Even if, as the State contends, homosexuals can find protection in laws and policies of general application, Amendment 2 goes well beyond merely depriving them of special rights. It imposes a broad disability upon those persons alone, forbidding them, but no others, to seek specific legal protection from injuries caused by discrimination in a wide range of public and private transactions. Pp. 4-9.\n \n (b) In order to reconcile the Fourteenth Amendment's promise that no person shall be denied equal protection with the practical reality that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, the Court has stated that it will uphold a law that neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class so long as the legislative classification bears a rational relation to some independent and legitimate legislative end. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319 -320. Amendment 2 fails, indeed defies, even this conventional inquiry. First, the amendment is at once too narrow and too broad, identifying persons by a single trait and then denying them the possibility of protection across the board. This disqualification of a class of persons from the right to obtain specific protection from the law is unprecedented and is itself a denial of equal protection in the most literal sense. Second, the sheer breadth of Amendment 2, which makes a general announcement that gays and lesbians shall not have any particular protections from the law, is so far removed from the reasons offered for it, i.e., respect for other citizens' freedom of association, particularly landlords or employers who have personal or religious objections to homosexuality, and the State's interest in conserving resources to fight discrimination against other groups, that the amendment cannot be explained by reference to those reasons; the Amendment raises the inevitable inference that it is born of animosity toward the class that it affects. Amendment 2 cannot be said to be directed to an identifiable legitimate purpose or discrete objective. It is a status-based classification of persons undertaken for its own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does not permit. Pp. 9-14.\n \n 882 P.2d 1335, affirmed.\n \n KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which STEVENS, O'CONNOR, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., joined. SCALIA, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which REHNQUIST, C. J., and THOMAS, J., joined. [ ROMER v. EVANS, ___ U.S. ___ (1996) , 1] \n\n \n I particularly commend this statement in the ruling:\n \n \nWe must conclude that Amendment 2 classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else. This Colorado cannot do. A State cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws. Amendment 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado is affirmed.\n\n \n This what the anti-gay marriage laws around the US do: deem gays strangers to equal protections. These laws are discriminatory and unconstitutional. But then, neoconservatives have no respect for the Constitution nor do they care much about discrimination, so long as they aren't on the receiving end.",

Thats simply unjust and in need of correction in our society. Let the churches tend to morality of their adherents. Let them keep their hands off the morality of those who are not adherent to their precepts. Allowing religious precepts of what is and is not a moral relationship between two persons to cross over into secular law is a violation of a key principle of American life - name the freedom of Religion, and indeed the freedom from Religious coercion. Render unto ceaser that which is ceasers (ie the economic realm, the realm of economic partnership and family partnerships).\n\n The \"key principle\" you cite here cannot be thought to invalidate laws that are enacted because of values derived from a religious belief. That is not in our Constitutional history, nor is it even an implication of our Constitutional tradition.",

   "Frankly, Steve, I don't much care for your interpretation of the Constitution. It's a minority one, and it makes no sense at all.\nMinority one? This might be the case today but it certainly was a majority one before the 1920s or so. In fact even today on the Supreme Court it is at least 2-4 judges support it which is more than any other theory on the supreme court. \n \n In reality my interpretation (aka originalism) is the best interpretation because it is the only interpretation that actually has a standard to go by. A living constitution only has the standard of what the judges thinks is best and this is far from a democracy as it creates a monarchy and certainly makes the judicial branch the strongest branch when in fact it is supposed to be the weakest. We could even look back at some of the early court cases to show how the reasoning was always focused on finding the original meaning of the text as this is what is important.\n \n I'm sorry you feel differently.\n \n \nI've been demolishing your arguments for weeks.\nI'm not sure how saying \"made clear you will always support Big Republican Government against individual liberties.\" is demolishing an argument. If this were a debate tournament I don't think that would fly. I've challenged you to a debate before and I'd still like to extend you that invitation and we can let unbiased individuals determine if you are right or not.\n \n \nBecause it's not his business to push an agenda, it's to uphold the law, the Constitution, and the rights of Americans. He only cares about the rights of white, male, heterosexual, Christian Americans. Well, he is more Catholic than the pope.\nIf the purpose is to uphold the law then you need to tell me how one reads the law. Is it read by what it meant when adopted or it is read as a judge feels it applies to today's society? If it's the later then that would be \"pushing an agenda\" as we all have different ideas of how things apply in today's society. If its the first one then I'd say should be a big supporter of Scalia and Thomas.",

   "This makes no sense. It requires further explanation, especially as to when you would suppose marriage classifications would ever be drawn according to hair color and also how on earth such a provision could ever be enforced. Hair color is as easy to change as a pair of socks.\n Actually I doubt there would be an equal protection violation if you added a marriage criteria of hair color. I admit the law would be rather stupid but certainly within the realm of legislative reach. Now if they said \"people with blonde hair can't marry\" then I'd say that's an equal protection violation.\n \n \nAs has already been said multiple times, classifications around race are subject to more scrutiny than any other classifications. That is mainly due to the fact that the obvious purpose of the 14th Amendment was to address racial classifications. It really should have remained there, too. But the Warren court changed the standard. Regardless, comparing racial classifications to any others, even under the wackiest of today's legal doctrines, is a false comparison.\n \n So please stop trying to invalidate someone's reasoning by trying to apply it to cases of race. A legal argument may be valid when applied to non-racial classifications that would be invalid if it were applied to racial classifications.\nEven if I had to say Loving was wrong under originalism I don't see what that proves. The people would be rather upset and would simply pass laws saying you can have interracial marriages. This worked for woman's right to vote and it can work for gay marriage as well.",

It is more than logical to pass a law because the people want it so. I hope you don't object to that but instead the reasoning why the people want to pass the law. In the case of many the logic behind coming to a stance on gay marriage is formed by a belief that's only logical conclusion is to oppose gay marriage. For you the only logical conclusion based on your beliefs is to allow it. Beyond that what can you really say is a logical reason for gay marriage or even marriage in general? People just have the belief it is an important function of society....there is no logical reasoning for this belief as it just is what it is.\n \n \nThe reasoning they use could make them enlightened.\nJudges are not philosophers and shouldn't be looking for enlightenment...their job is to apply the law to cases. Having 9 lawyers decide how our country will operate is hardly an enlightened idea. \n \n Of course if 5 of them said they have been enlightened and find that gay marriage bans are ok then I'd suspect you would object to this right away but if you want to make the court about \"enlightenment\" then people would want to get people in their that see their \"enlightened\" views instead of the people they oppose.

Historical interpretation is not all that will be considered. There's more than one way to change a law. Judges with their interpretation are one possible means. They are not limited by history. The courts have the power to change the definition of marriage.\nAnd apparently the definition of \"judge\" according to you. I often wonder why only a judge can change his or her role from what it originally meant but not the president or congress. Could the president assume the power to do a line-item veto? No...that's not what the constitution says in Article I Section 7 but you could construe it to mean such a thing. Furthermore, why would you want judges to have a standard outside of what it originally meant? What should they go by? Personal opinion? Polling reports? Other countries decisions? The list is endless and without a set standard the judge could choose anyone of those and we'd never know what the constitution means. With your interpretation you cannot tell me for sure that gay marriage is protected by the constitution. You have decided that only 5 out of 9 lawyers at the Supreme Court know this but I must tell you that you cannot object if they rule against you because by your definition they are right. \n \n Under my view (which was the way a judge worked for the first 100yrs or so) we can better under the constitution and its meaning. Perhaps history cannot tell us all the answers and this is why we have lawyers up there instead of doctors but it certainly can tell you the most and at least they all have the same goal of trying to find out what the provisions in the constitution meant when adopted by the people. I'd really have no objection to someone arguing with me on the grounds that the original meaning of the 14th amendment means equal protection for all in a strict sense of the word but I do object to someone telling me it doesn't matter because it means that know (or should). In any event the 14th amendment has no evidence to support a strict test for all.\n \n \nIf one wants to prevent gays from having the same rights as straights, one has to argue the case, as gay rights supporters will argue, and there are several possible routes to do this.\nThere are and I don't question that.

   "Oh and Steve, I think I finally twigged what you meant with your cryptic statement that \"not many were spared\" in the Holocaust. You meant that everyone suffered equally, and so it isn't a big deal.\n \n Wrong on both counts. The Holocaust was directed very selectively against discrete groups of people. The initial victims were the mentally disabled. Eugenics decreed that they should not be suffered to live, and so the extermination of undesirables began.\n \n The Jews, of course, across all of Nazi dominated Europe, were the principal targets. I can understand that Jewish survivors get prickly about comparing their experience to others. However, that doesn't mean the comparison is illegitimate. It means that Jews came first in the Holocaust and suffered in the greatest numbers, and that was a Nazi preference. The Holocaust is indeed principally about the genocide of European Jews, and that history shouldn't be forgotten or minimised. However, it is also about the extermination of others the Nazis feared and hated.\n \n German gays were another group targetted specifically by the Nazis, because they were sexual \"perverts\" and didn't breed Aryans. Well, Christianity taught the Nazis that. Then there were gypsies (Romany peoples) and Jehovah's Witnesses. Christians as a group were never targetted by the Nazis. Those Christians who resisted the Nazis were targetted not because they were Christian, but because they were seen as traitors to the regime.\n \n The Holocaust is comparable to slavery. Perhaps it's even worse, but then, this is just playing the \"my people suffered more than yours\" game. They were both up there in horror. Just don't try to tell me that gay people have never suffered because they were gay. OK, six million gays didn't die at the hands of the Nazis. Millions of gays weren't ripped from their lands and families and enslaved. Yes, those experiences were of a different kind from the troubles gays have seen over the centuries, though thousands, maybe tens of thousands of gays were exterminated in the Holocaust. But gays have been persecuted throughout centuries of Christianity. That is a reality.\n \n So don't tell me it's an insult to compare the struggles of gay people with the struggles of black people.

   "I find the comparison insulting because the struggles black men and women had to go through was on a different level from any other struggle (for purposes of this argument I'll exclude holocausts which are more of a concentrated struggle but nevertheless on the same level). A war was fought over slavery, blacks were property and not people, blacks were regularly killed and was not against the law, etc, etc. Any group trying to obtain \"rights\" could say its the same as the argument for blacks but the magnitude is so extremely different that any comparison almost belittles it. Now if you used some of the same arguments used by blacks then that is fine because those are arguments outside skin color but those are arguments of nature rights and things like that.\n\n \n This is a difficult question, frankly. I do think that African Americans experienced an oppression that was different from that experienced by any other group in North America, because of slavery and the racialization of slavery and the legacy of that experience. Native Americans certainly suffered a terrible fate at the hands of Europeans and their descendants, and they were mostly wiped out in North America. In contrast, Africans and their descendants were turned into a huge unfree labor force, a labor force that permitted white people to have liberty and some measure of equality through the forced labor of black people. Because of that kind of economic exploitation, of being owned by other human beings, African Americans did experience a different oppression from everyone else. \n \n However, I think that comparisons between the experiences of African Americans and the experiences of other groups do help to illuminate the nature of oppression. People who oppress others tend to use similar strategies and similar rationalizations in different circumstances. \n \n The oppression of gay people is different, I think, from the oppression of African Americans in that gay people are not oppressed for the purpose of serving as a labor force and a source of wealth for others. I think that gay people are oppressed in order to keep the patriarchal gender order in place. I think that homophobia is largely a means of shaming men into continuing to dominate women and to try to live up to certain notions of what manhood means. It enforces male conformity. (Homophobia does this far less to women, at least nowadays.) But there are similarities to racial oppression in that part of racial oppression also served the purpose of keeping the white partriarchal gender order in place. It's astonishing how much the oppression of black people involved preventing black men from living according to the white standard of manhood, especially under slavery but also afterwards. \n \n I think that this is an area of racial oppression that deserves more scholarly scrutiny than it has received: the history of racial oppression in sustaining the white patriarchal gender order, through the exclusion of black men from white male gender roles and through the access of white men to black women, in the case of slave masters and slave women.",

It's astonishing how much the oppression of black people involved preventing black men from living according to the white standard of manhood, especially under slavery but also afterwards.\n\n \n Nice to see you back! emoticon_xagree You've hit a couple of nails on the head here. Homophobia is substantially about gay men not acting the way men are \"supposed\" to act, and \"letting the side down\". We aren't patriarchal team players, for the most part, and our nonconformity is threatening to men who would be patriarchs, and the women who want patriarchs in their lives. Gays do not validate those notions... by their very existence they reject them, because a relationship between two men is commonly one of equals, not one of dominance with \"weaker\" and \"stronger\" sexes.\n \n It's worth noting that homophobia in the black Christian community is significantly stronger than among white Christians. I suspect this has something to do with the history of the powerlessness of black Americans. As a result, they overcompensate in their respect for authority and conformity. They had to be better Christians than whites, better at fearing their god, just to survive, and homosexuality just doesn't fit into the authoritarian, conformist picture. Being gay seems to be seen as betraying the race by letting the standards down.",

   "It's not logical that illegal actions such as relations with the underage and polygamy would be protected.\n\n \n Your reasoning for why the 14th amendment does not protect such practices is not quite right. The issue is not that these practices are illegal; the issue is whether the laws making the practices illegal violate the due process or equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. If they do, the Supreme Court will, if presented with a case, strike the laws down. \n \n The 14th amendment, as part of the constitution, trumps state laws. The Supreme Court has ruled that some state laws are unconstitutional because they run afoul of the 14th amendment. This means that the actions that those state laws made illegal are indeed protected by the 14th amendment, and the laws making the actions illegal were struck down. \n \n An example of this was the illegal action of a married inter-racial couple moving to Virginia during the time when the Virginia anti-miscegenation law was in force. Mildred and Richard Loving were arrested for breaking Virginia's anti-miscegenation law. Their lawsuit against Virginia resulted in the Supreme Court ruling that the Virginia law banning inter-racial marriage was an unconstitutional violation of the 14th amendment. Therefore, the illegal action of the Lovings in breaking the anti-miscegenation law was protected by the 14th amendment, and their illegal action was thus rendered legal by Supreme Court ruling. \n \n The Supreme Court is certainly not going to rule that state laws setting an age of consent for marriage are unconstitutional, because these laws have a rational basis, and there is a compelling state interest in enacting age of consent laws. The Supreme Court is also not going to rule that state laws banning or refusing to recognize polygamous marriages are unconstitutional, because the Supreme Court has already ruled on this question, and they are unlikely to overturn precedent on this. The Supreme Court is almost certainly not going to overturn the laws making these practices illegal, because these states laws, in the view of the Supreme Court, do not run afoul of the 14th amendment equal protection or due process clauses.\n \n I personally think that the Supreme Court ruling upholding a law banning polygamy was wrong. I think that polygamy is protected by the 14th amendment, and I think the Supreme Court erred in its ruling. I see no rational basis for states to ban polygamy. The only reason I can see for states to ban polygamy is religious conviction, which should not be the basis for secular law. Some might argue that polygamy allows men to force underage women into marriage, but underage marriage and polygamy are not the same thing, and states can and should enforce their age of consent laws. \n \n But polygamy is a separate issue from same-sex marriage, and it needs its own discussion and debate. It's not the same issue as same-sex marriage, just as the debate over cousin marriage is not the same issue as same-sex marriage.",

   "Ok lets review the amendment again...\n\n \n Let's not. I've explained to you before, quoting liberally from Madison, why the 9th Amendment isn't just empty words, there to fill a gap in the parchment between the 8th and 10th. It exists because Madison knew very well that some would be keen to assert that the only rights people had were those explicitly listed, because they wanted to abrogate others for nefarious reasons. As I mentioned before, he saw you guys coming, and made a pre-emptive strike agin you.\n \n \nWell you are outside the US so you are right if you think I can't dictate your rights.\n\n \n Well, for that, I am truly grateful. The religious right in the US is enough to make anyone nervous. A veritable Christian Taliban. However, you can't dictate to US residents, either, or rather, you can't under the Constitution. Of course, if you are politically powerful enough to shred the Constitution, as the religious right wants, then you can do whatever you damn well please. My bet is y'all won't achieve that much power, and gay rights is just one of the rocks the power lust of America's religious right is foundering on.\n \n Even the GOP is starting to wonder whether its marriage to religious extremists isn't a poison pill, because American voters with values just aren't buying the values the religious extremists want them to swallow. Gay rights is just one of the issues the religious extremists are way out of step with reasonable people on.\n \n The crumbling of the political power of the religious extremists in this political cycle began (or at least became noticeable) with the Terri Schiavo case, when their shrill, exploitative posturing got very bad reviews in the polls. Their failure to get anywhere with the evil anti-gay marriage constitutional amendment was just another nail in their coffin. Most Americans just don't share the self-righteous, tyrannical values of religious extremists, and they consider them, rightly, to be dangerous. Their tide has crested for now, and they've brought the GOP down with them, which many conservatives won't forgive them for.\n \n Too bad! :)",

It's not the same issue as same-sex marriage, just as the debate over cousin marriage is not the same issue as same-sex marriage.\n\n \n I do agree that polygamy law is a red herring with respect to gay rights. I am not sure, however, that you can really make a case against it based on the 14th Amendment, because such laws do not seem to me violate either due process or equal rights. There is no natural class of polygamists whose basic human rights are being denied by the refusal of government to recognise more than the first of their marriages. That refusal applies to everyone across the board, and I'm not aware of any group of people whose basic humanity is being violated because the state refuses to recognise more than the first of their marriages, or more than one at a time.\n \n I don't think this argument is analogous to the one that gays do not have their equal rights violated because laws prohibit straights from marrying a same sex partner as well. How many people does someone have a right to marry at the same time? Does the law need to be infinitely flexible on this issue? Should the social security benefits to the thousandth spouse upon decease of the primary partner be the same as to the first? Where do our obligations to recognise someone's partnerships end? Never?\n \n I think maybe there is a 1st Amendment argument against making polygamy illegal, but there's also a difference between making polygamy illegal, and simply refusing to recognise more than the first marriage, without criminalising any subsequent private partnerships. Suppose government decided to abolish legal divorce. Would that be unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment, because it discriminated against those who had left their wives or husbands by refusing to allow them to marry again? How many bites of the cherry is the government obliged to let them have under equal protections? Is a man married to a thousand wives, serially or simultaneously, equal to a man married to one, and are his rights really infringed if we draw the line at one for him and everyone else without exception, if only for pragmatic reasons?\n \n I agree that polygamy and gay marriage are completely separate issues, but that's why I would make different arguments respecting their recognition by government.",

That would appear to be one of those rights NOT enumerated.\n\n \n Well, you have points, though I don't see the right to marry as many spouses as will have you or you can buy as something so basic to human nature, so essential to one's concept of self, that refusing to recognise it leads to significant psychic harm the way homophobia or racism do. However, I'd be open to persuasion to the contrary.\n \n On the other hand, while I would oppose laws recognising polygamy, i wouldn't consider them so fatally destructive they would have to be morally opposed at all costs. I just think we are currently better off for a number of rational reasons not recognising polygamy, but I'm not making any basic moral judgement about it. I would oppose criminalising it, with the exception of fraud in obtaining government benefits for extra-legal spouses. \n \n As far as I'm concerned, anyone can live with as many partners as they can stand, but there seems little reason to recognise more than one per person as a legal spouse, and so long as everyone is subject to the same restriction, I can't see a foul. No-one is stopping someone from taking one wife and dozens of concubines if they wish. It's even biblical! ;) \n \n I just don't see that it's legally or pragmatically equal to treat a family with dozens of spouses the same way as a family limited to two. For example, are we obliged to support through our taxes and social security contributions as many spouses as someone declares are married, while only getting support for our single one? That doesn't seem equal to me!\n \n It's a compromise, but a workable one that doesn't seem unfair to anyone.

(Disparage here means to lower in rank or importance, to depreciate, not speak ill of.)\n \n In other words, what the ninth says, as explained by Madison and is clear from a normal reading of the English text, is that the government cannot construe (=interpret) the existence of a list of rights in the Constitution to mean that rights possessed by the people are limited solely to that list. Since it can only be the government that is enjoined from denying and disparaging such unlisted rights, that is the exact equivalent of saying the Constitution protects the enjoyment by the people of such rights against any unconstitutional attempt by the government to take them away or reduce them in importance.\n \n If you want to take away such rights, you have to pass a constitutional amendment, as the religious right is trying to do with the federal anti-gay marriage amendment. I strongly oppose their religion and theocratic politics, but I can't fault their reading of the Constitution in this case. Antigay marriage laws are on very dubious constitutional grounds (and not merely because of the 9th Amendment, the 14th is more relevant), and more and more judges are beginning to realise this.",

   "The problem, Steve, is not the 9th Amendment, which is crystal clear despite all the attempts here to reconstrue it. It's in getting agreement on what rights are retained by the people.\n \n I've explained my view on this over and over again previously. To me, human rights are those values necessary to maintain a fair and decent society where individual liberties are maximised, and the pursuit of happiness (self-determination) is unimpeded by government to every extent not necessary for maintenance of civil order. \n \n (The pursuit of happiness is not, of course, intended to mean some right to get your jollies whenever you feel like it. It's the right to self-determination, the right to attempt to carve out some niche in life that sooths the soul and satisfies the senses, that secures our physical and mental well-being in ways that we determine for ourselves, and is not established by some human power or authority over us.)\n \n Human rights are intrinsic to human nature, because by nature we require certain minimum conditions to be met in order to live our lives freely and contentedly, and the value of individual freedom from government coercion is an axiom that is commonly agreed to be true, even if it cannot be formally proven within any philosophical system. We know it to be true, because we can compare societies where people do not have such freedom, and all other things being equal, we generally would prefer to live in greater freedom.\n \n Now one can argue endlessly whether such rights are derived from \"God\" as many Christians do, or from \"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\" as the deists who wrote the DoI and Constitution put it, or from the biology of human nature as secular free thinkers might aver, but it doesn't matter. These rights are taken in all cases as necessaries without which a decent human society with the widest scope for the pursuit of happiness is impossible. \n \n All that is left for us to do is argue about which of those rights we will respect, and which we will deny or disparage. The Constitution demands that constitutional government not deny or disparage any of them -- and I would certainly argue that the best government is the one that governs least in personal matters, and that recognises the widest range of such rights. The only way to deny the right of gays to marry is to assert, as you do, Steve (and I can't fault your consistency there, just your premises and conclusion), that marriage itself is not a human right. But to do that, you would have to assert that freedom of association is not a human right, either, and that a society has the power and right to control whom people form intimate relationships and partnerships with. That way, of course, lies dictatorship. \n \n Once you start chopping away at these rights in order to do down some minority you disapprove of religiously, you will soon find that the rights you are eagerly dismantling are the very ones your own liberty rests on.",

   "In other words, what the ninth says, as explained by Madison and is clear from a normal reading of the English text, is that the government cannot construe (=interpret) the existence of a list of rights in the Constitution to mean that rights possessed by the people are limited solely to that list. Since it can only be the government that is enjoined from denying and disparaging such unlisted rights, that is the exact equivalent of saying the Constitution protects the enjoyment by the people of such rights against any unconstitutional attempt by the government to take them away or reduce them in importance.\nYou made a few vast assumptions here. You assume one that the state and federal governments have the same powers. This is not true as stated in the 10th amendment. The two best scholars on the 9th amendment are probably Kurt Lash and Randy Barnett. Kurt Lash argues the point I make which is that this amendment is largely a federalist amendment. Randy Barnett originally argued a better version of your point but has since conceded into thinking that it could easily mean what Kurt Lash says it means. They now both agree that it only applies to the federal government (the 9th alone). \n \n Your second assumption says that government can't deny or disparage those unlisted rights. This is not true either! It just says you can't use the listed rights as a means to do so.\n \n The biggest flaw in your argument is probably the fact that even if you were right then how on earth would you know what those other rights are? In fact you wouldn't and the amendment gives no authority to decide who would. Luckily with my reading you can now exactly what those other rights are as it is explained in the 10th amendment very clearly. This gets back to the idea that these two amendments work together as they were written together and at one point one amendment. At the very least if we took your side then the only way we could get those rights would be to look at what rights existed when the people who adopted the amendment were around. Since you prefer Madison I will post his thoughts on constitutional interpretation below:\n If we were to look therefore, for the meaning of the\n instrument, beyond the face of the instrument, we must look for it not in\n the general convention, which proposed, but in the state conventions,\n which accepted and ratified the constitution.\n Doesn't get any clearer than that.\n \n But now to address the main point. It is clear that the 9th had two purposes of one guarding retained rights and two limiting undue federal power. You disagree in the means by which they guarded and that it only limits the federal government. I address this below:\n \n The first draft of the amendment read as follows:\n The exceptions, here or elsewhere in the Constitution, made in favor of particular rights, shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people, or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the Constitution; but either as actual limitations of such powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution.\n Note that it specifically mentioned limitation of enlarged of constitutional powers. Of course the only powers in the constitution are those for the federal government as evidenced by the original draft of the 10th:\n The powers not delegated by this Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the\n states, are reserved to the States respectively.Madison later confirmed this by saying:...that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the general government,...Madison states here that he did not want the federal (or general as he put it) government to be assigned the rights that they had no power to control. \n \n In a letter to Jefferson, Madison clearly stated that enlargement of federal power by a Bill of Rights was a major concern:\n My own opinion has always been in favor of a bill of rights; provided it be so framed as not to imply powers not meant to be included in the\n enumeration.\n In order to do this Madison actually looked at many proposed amendments and decided that Virginia's 1st and 17th amendment were ones worth putting in to address federalism arguments. The 17th was the original basis for the 9th amendment and is read as:\n That those clauses which declare that Congress shall not exercise certain powers to be interpreted in any manner whatsoever to extend the powers of\n Congress. But that they may be construed either as making exceptions to\n the specified powers where this shall be the case, or otherwise as inserted merely for greater caution.\n The 9th amendment was to address this concern and the original draft (posted above) was the result. Later on congress edited the draft and you get what you see today.\n \n Now the amendment gets debated in the state conventions. As stated earlier this is where Madison believes the real meaning comes from. Here is one objection to the 9th amendment during Virginia's debate on the constitution:\n On the two last [the Ninth and Tenth Amendments] a debate of\n some length took place, which ended in rejection. Mr. E.\n Randolph who advocated all the other[] [amendments] stood in\n this contest in the front of opposition. His principal objection\n was pointed against the word retained in the eleventh proposed\n amendment, and his argument if I understood it was applied in\n this manner, that as the rights declared in the first ten of the\n proposed amendments were not all that a free people would\n require the exercise of; and that as there was no criterion by\n which it could be determined whither any other particular right\n was retained or not, it would be more safe, & more consistent\n with the spirit of the 1st & 17th amendments proposed by\n Virginia, that this reservation against constructive power, should\n operate rather as a provision against extending the powers of\n Congress by their own authority, than as a protection to rights\n reducable to no definitive certainty.\n This clearly indicated that Randolph understood the meaning of the 9th amendment to be a federalism type amendment but he felt it would be manipulated to mean something else and would like the language of the 17th to be used instead as it was clearer. \n \n It should be pointed out now that the terms \"power\" and \"rights\" are pretty much the same thing according to Madison as shown below as a response to Washington regarding the Randolph objection:\n The difficulty started [against] the amendments is really unlucky,\n and the more to be regretted as it springs from a friend to the\n Constitution. It is a still greater cause of regret, if the distinction\n be, as it appears to me, altogether fanciful. If a line can be\n drawn between the powers granted and the rights retained, it\n would seem to be the same thing whether the latter be secured by\n declaring that they shall not be abridged, or that the former shall\n not be extended.\n Another letter given to Washington by Madison (not written by him though) read as follows: But others among whom I am one see not the force of [Randolph's] distinction, for by preventing an extension of be insured if its powers are not too extensive already, & so by protecting the rights of the people & of the States, an improper extension of power will be prevented & safety made equally certain.This refers back to the idea that the 9th amendment clearly was federalist in nature as it was seen as protecting the rights of the people and the States.\n \n Of course the states were a little confused but Madison once again comes up to the plate and delivers his speech regarding the Bank of the US and explains without question the meaning of the 9th amendment. Lets take a look at what he said:\n ...These explanations were the more to be respected, as they had not only been proposed by Congress, but ratified by nearly three-fourths\n of the states. He read several of the articles proposed, remarking particularly on the 11th. and 12th [the 9th and 10th] the former, as guarding against a latitude of interpretation-the latter, as excluding every source of power not within the constitution itself.Stating right afterwards:In fine, if the power were in the constitution, the immediate exercise of it cannot be essential-if not there, the exercise of it involves the guilt of usurpation, and establishes a precedent of interpretation, levelling all the barriers which limit the powers of the general government, and protect those of the state governments.\n This clearly indicated this amendment is referring to limits on power and state rights. \n \n Of course you can look at an even better indicator by seeing how courts looked the amendment immediately after its ratification and I will do that now but according to Kurt Lash: Every scholar or judge (state or federal) prior to the Progressive era who discussed or applied the Ninth viewed it as a federalist provision protecting the reserved autonomy of the states. I have found scattered attempts by lawyers to use an individual rights reading of the Ninth in defense of their client. This is not surprising given that the Ninth protected both individual and collective rights.\n \n A look at these cases including the first case in 1820 addressing the 9th shows that this amendment is only read as a federalism amendment and not as you see it. If needed we can get into the post adoption cases.\n \n Also interesting is a school book from around 1800 (or a few years earlier) which had this question: What rights and powers remain to the individual states?\n \n Answer:\n All the powers not delegated to the United States, by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. And the enumeration in the constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. So that a great number of rights and powers, which the several states individually claim, remain perfectly to them, notwithstanding this constitution.\n \n \n In any event this is the kind of evidence I'm looking for. I think the evidence speaks for itself and you can counter if you see fit.",

   "Here is a link to a clearly written essay by legal scholar Randy Barnett on the meaning of the 9th amendment. \n \n http://randybarnett.com/26val419.htm\n \n Barnett argues that a proper interpretation of the ninth amendment requires not the enforcement of specific enumerated rights, but a \"presumption of liberty\" for individuals. By this he means that it is up to the government to justify denying liberty to the people. If the government cannot do this, then the people must be free to exercise their liberty. \n \n This argument bolsters my contention that unless the government can show a rational reason for denying someone the right to marry the person of his or her choice, including someone of the same sex, the liberty exists and cannot be denied. It is up to the government to justify denying the liberty to the individuals; the burden falls on the government, as there must be a presumption of liberty.\n \n I am not a libertarian, but I find Barnett's arguments convincing. I recommend that people who want to look afresh at the 9th amendment read Barnett's work, including his recent book Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty.",

For example an originalist look at the 2nd amendment means you have the right to bear arms. \"Arms\" was not defined as only a musket but as any gun. When complaints come about not using the original meaning it is because a judge has taken an meaning and changed it.

Of course, it all depends on how the result is to be brought about, but utilitarianism far more closely approaches the reality of human morality than any religion.

If I have reason to know that the earth orbits the sun, and that day will follow night, I cannot be said to have faith in it. That distorts the meaning of faith.

That is your central caricature because it leaves the question begging of what is the greatest good, and how many people down the line are to be considered the greatest number.\n \n Even a utilitarian is allowed to answer \"I don't know\" to either of these.

It begs the question and your support is really a fallacy. I thought you were for reason?\n\n \n On the contrary. I may not be able to prove anything by a result, but I can easily disprove something. If you claim that religious homophobia is a social good, I can demonstrate that it is not, by pointing to its consequences.\n \n \nIn short empiricism is only as good as what you have seen. It assumes what you have experienced is correct and that what you have experienced was correctly understood by you. There seems to be an awful lot of faith in this world view.\n\n \n No faith at all, because even empirical conclusions based on evidence need only be held provisionally. More evidence might overturn them. We are back to the compelling reason to legislatively enforce homophobia.\n \n \nThen stop telling me whether I am right or wrong, good or evil. There is no way you can tell me this since there no principal to follow.\n\n \n I don't follow authoritarian principles. Or even principals. Especially not authoritarian principals. I am not telling you you are good or evil; but I can use reason to establish to my own satisfaction that you are wrong in your reasoning, and in your axioms.\n \n \nThe only way you could say a school shooting, for example, is wrong is to say it is wrong to yourself but you can't say it was wrong in the views of the people that did it. And if this is the case why should you impose your morality on others (a famous argument you like to make)!\n\n \n Even if your caricature of utilitarianism were true, it would fail here, because the mass murderer is out-voted by his victims.\n \n In any case, a utilitarian would have no problem deciding whether a school shooting was right or wrong. If someone shot a mass murderer in a school, I think that would be right; if they shot innocent children and teachers, that would be wrong. See... no problem in deciding right v. wrong in this case, and I didn't even need to consult the bible. The hypothetical pleasure of the mass murderer is set against the pain and anguish of the victims, and their families and friends. No contest. Utilitarianism works in practice, because it considers not merely the greatest good, but the good of the individual. The good of the masses is nothing more than the summation of individual good, after all, and you can't make that summation without considering individual good.\n \n But you will accuse me of heresy against your personal caricature of utilitarianism again. Suffice it to say, your caricature is not my philosophy.\n \n \nyet that assumes reason works. By what would you judge it working if not for reason? Perhaps on faith?\n\n \n Not faith.

   "Not really. That is your central caricature because it leaves the question begging of what is the greatest good, and how many people down the line are to be considered the greatest number.\n \n Even a utilitarian is allowed to answer \"I don't know\" to either of these. Utilitarianism is a guide for reasoning about ethical behaviour, not a prescription for correct behaviour under any and all circumstances.\n \n As to the appeal to reason as opposed to mob rule, I think that's a very good and basic utilitarian value, because a utilitarian will take into account factors beyond instant gratification. You might not, but a utilitarian will. Assessing what is good, or who benefits, is not a simple proposition, and as a utilitarian of sorts, I would never dream of claiming it was simple. Sometimes it can be, but usually it is not.\n \n To bring utilitarianism into the gay rights debate means to ask who benefits from homophobia, or who benefits from equal rights. If there really were a major social benefit to homophobia, you might have an argument. But you can't establish one.\nYou point out the basic flaws with such a view. You can never establish what is good and evil based on this view. It is impossible. It only suggests you do the greatest good.\n \n \nWell, actually, it TESTS the question.\nIt tests the question assuming the conclusion to be true in order to understand the results. This, of course, is begging the question.\n \n \nOnce again, you leave out an important part of the equation, and that's evidence. Reason alone cannot establish anything outside the realm of mathematics. But empiricism is grist to reason's mill.\nThere is no evidence that doesn't beg the question at first.\n \n \nOn the contrary. I may not be able to prove anything by a result, but I can easily disprove something. If you claim that religious homophobia is a social good, I can demonstrate that it is not, by pointing to its consequences.\nOf course this assumes you know all the consequences. I doubt this is possible. \n \n \nNo faith at all, because even empirical conclusions based on evidence need only be held provisionally. More evidence might overturn them. We are back to the compelling reason to legislatively enforce homophobia.\nYou argue that something is true until evidence is introduced otherwise. This means there is no truth and no right and wrong. If there is no right and wrong there is no morality outside of yourself. We then all have arbitrary starting points by which nothing is absolute and thus reason is not absolute. In short, you have established a way to where nothing is wrong or right which begs the question why you are arguing with me.\n \n \nI don't follow authoritarian principles. Or even principals. Especially not authoritarian principals. I am not telling you you are good or evil; but I can use reason to establish to my own satisfaction that you are wrong in your reasoning, and in your axioms.\nHow can you say my axioms are wrong when there is no right and wrong that is absolute to judge by? It can only be right and wrong to you...but perhaps not to me or others. If this is the case then we shouldn't really care what others think. As for my reasoning, the only conclusion that can be drawn from my faith is the one I have.\n \n \n \n\n Even if your caricature of utilitarianism were true, it would fail here, because the mass murderer is out-voted by his victims.\nYet you can only say this if utilitarianism is a universal truth. You previously suggested you were an absolutist.\n \n \nIn any case, a utilitarian would have no problem deciding whether a school shooting was right or wrong. If someone shot a mass murderer in a school, I think that would be right; if they shot innocent children and teachers, that would be wrong.\nAre you suggesting this is the true view everyone should follow? Seems odd given other statements you have made. Furthermore it doesn't establish killing to be wrong (utilitarianism that is). Something else has to tell you it is wrong to kill.\n \n \nNot faith. Experience.\nOk, you beg the question and go against the very reason you preach.\n \n \nEmpiricism is a way out of circular reasoning. It cuts the Gordian knot.\nby creating a logical fallacy?

There is a whole chain of reasoning involved here, and it is anchored to reality by assessing the real life consequences of public policy or individual behaviour on individuals and on society as whole.\n \n This is why atheists find it as easy to be moral as theists, perhaps even easier, because they have to rely on reason to justify behaviour rather than some arbitrary scripture. You will find that where scripture is reasonable in advocating morality, it pretty much follows human nature in common with, say, Secular Humanism; where it is not, as with its proscriptions against gay love, it offends against human nature.\n \n \nIt tests the question assuming the conclusion to be true in order to understand the results.

There is no morality outside human nature, or outside groups of people. (Or any other animal with a system of morals.) Human nature is what defines morality, and it's the standard against which human behaviour is measured. It's the only standard there is, which is why there is so much disagreement about the details, though some basics are considered pretty universal.\n \n Your appeal to religion as providing an absolute standard is totally unsatisfactory, because all that does is provide a standard arrived at by some self-appointed priesthood. It's no better than anyone else's standard, as long as it eschews reason. \n \n If I may remind you of a quote from one of Europe's most historically prominent Christians:\n \n \nBut since the devil's bride, Reason, that pretty whore, comes in and thinks she's wise, and what she says, what she thinks, is from the Holy Spirit, who can help us, then? Not judges, not doctors, no king or emperor, because [reason] is the Devil's greatest whore.

Dr. Martin Luthers Werke: Kritische Gesamtausgabe. (Weimar: Herman Boehlaus Nachfolger, 1914), Band 51:126, Line 7ff\n \n\n \n Luther, of course, relied solely on faith, and correctly saw reason as the enemy of faith. That's why he made so many errors. There is no absolute universal standard of right or wrong, but there are contextual standards based objectively on what we know of human nature, what makes people happy, and what hurts them.\n \n \nHow can you say my axioms are wrong when there is no right and wrong that is absolute to judge by?\n\n \n I go by reason, not by right or wrong.\n \n \nIt can only be right and wrong to you...but perhaps not to me or others.\n\n \n If what you do, or your religion does, injures me or other human beings, then it cannot by any utilitarian argument be right, unless there is some measurably greater, known benefit to be gained. You haven't been able to articulate what this hypothetically greater benefit of abrogating the human rights of gay people is supposed to be, and that is the task that remains before you.",

I don't assume its truth -- or if I do, I do so provisionally.\nAnd again we get into circular reasoning. In short, you have to start from something. Ideally you'd call this truth but that isn't important. So you go from this starting point and use reason to get to other points. Now, that very first starting point is what I call the very basic basis of understanding. There is no way to prove it as it is pretty much an axiom or unproven theory. You can't prove it using reason because it would create a loop (like going from A to A to prove A). An unprovable theory, by dictionary definition, is called faith. I'll grant you that it is a lame definition though and one I disagree with. If we went by my definition then we would agree you have no faith.\n \n \nWelcome to the real world of doubt and uncertainty. This is why reasonable people are very dubious about absolute moral systems that claim to have some sort of absolute truth. they never do.\nI wouldn't want a life where I never know what was right or wrong. It would be hard to say the shooter at Virginia Tech did anything wrong...or rather illogical to say so.\n \n\n If you're wrong, why should I say otherwise?\nMe being wrong assumes an absolute standard or right and wrong. If it is only base do you or a collection of people then this certainly doesn't prove anything.\n \n \nI don't. I merely point out that unless morality is based on reason, it's worthless.\nNothing can be based on reason. Reason can only tell us if we break a moral code. You confuse a basis with a tool for determination.\n \n \nI'll bet there are, Steve, which makes you a moral relativist with the best of them!\nNot sure how they makes you a relativist. \n \n \nReason alone can't define right or wrong, you do need to understand human nature, what helps and hurts. But without reason, the situation is hopeless.\nI agree that without reason you could never understand whether a scenario is right or wrong but you need a basis of what's right and wrong before you can apply reason to it. \n \n \nIt's worth asking religious people who like to claim that religious faith is essential for morality whether the only thing that makes them behave morally is their faith in and fear of god\nWho said it's the fear of God that makes one believe in morality?",

   "No it doesn't but I'd like to ask why you think this? My theory on right and wrong specifically goes against certain aspects of human nature.\n\n \n How so? You mean by condemning gay relationships as immoral? That certainly goes against human nature, at least the human nature of gay people, and reason as well. Your theory of right and wrong here is not one that stands against empirical scrutiny. It's based purely on superstition.\n \n \nAgain, reason gets from point to point but doesn't provide a basis for anything. You might have gotten to this theory by reason but it needed to be based on something else. Either faith or some other theory. If not you started from nothing and reasoned your way to a theory like a train arriving at a station but had no origin.\n\n \n Well, you are groping at a legitimate point here, so let me throw out another perspective based on a biological analysis of human nature. The question you ask, in effect, is do I base my actual moral behaviour solely on reason? You suspect not, and I'll admit you have a point.\n \n I base my moral behaviour in large part on what I've been taught, what I have internalised through years of moral training in my family, among friends and neighbours, and in the larger society I am a member of. In short, my moral behaviour is largely instinctual -- in part innate, in part trained through participation in my culture. If I do something moral, I do it because it feels right; if I do something immoral, I do it despite it feeling not right.\n \n So to a large degree, I base my behaviour on my acquired and innate instincts. How do I know these are right? Well, without reason, I can't. However, like every human I do have the ability to reason about my behaviour. I can reason about the consequences of my behaviour and of my instincts, and if reason confirms them, they are strengthened; if reason contradicts then, then they become weakened. it's a constant process of learning.\n \n This is how I learned gay love is not immoral, despite all the lies I've been taught about that. I reasoned it out, despite what I had been taught. My morality can be based on innate and acquired instincts, but it can and should be amended by reason.\n \n \nIn short, you have to start from something.\n\n \n We start from what we are taught, by parents, preachers and politicians. If we then fail in maturity to use our reason to analyse those teachings in the light of reality and experience, it's our fault, and no longer our teachers'.\n \n \nIdeally you'd call this truth but that isn't important.\n\n \n On the contrary, it's extremely important. The only starting place we have, what we are taught, is not necessarily what is true. So how can we arrive at truth? Only by applying reason in the context of real world consequences.\n \n \nSo you go from this starting point and use reason to get to other points.\n\n \n Or you can use reason to reject the starting point and choose another one.\n \n \nNow, that very first starting point is what I call the very basic basis of understanding. There is no way to prove it as it is pretty much an axiom or unproven theory. You can't prove it using reason because it would create a loop (like going from A to A to prove A). An unprovable theory, by dictionary definition, is called faith. I'll grant you that it is a lame definition though and one I disagree with. If we went by my definition then we would agree you have no faith.\n\n \n As I said earlier, it is only unprovable within its own philosophical system. that doesn't mean we can't hope to prove or disprove it from outside the system. When I changed my mind about the morality of sexual orientation, naturally I had to go outside Christianity to disprove the anti-homosexual axioms. This is, in part, why I am no longer a Christian: that religion rings utterly false to me... not unlike a cracked bell.\n \n \nI wouldn't want a life where I never know what was right or wrong.\n\n \n You might as well not want a life where you suffer and die. You can't avoid not knowing right from wrong, sometimes. Other times, you can reason your way towards it. What you can least afford to do is reckon you know it without reason.\n \n \nIt would be hard to say the shooter at Virginia Tech did anything wrong...or rather illogical to say so.\n\n \n I wouldn't find it hard to say! He did wrong. No problem, no argument, no angst. Any utilitarian can figure it out.\n \n \nMe being wrong assumes an absolute standard or right and wrong. If it is only base do you or a collection of people then this certainly doesn't prove anything.\n\n \n Not really. It only requires a contextual standard. Absolute standards are a mirage, or an excuse to punish people who disagree with your standards.\n \n \nNothing can be based on reason. Reason can only tell us if we break a moral code. You confuse a basis with a tool for determination.\n\n \n Our entire modern world is based on reason. Is it \"nothing\"?\n \n \nI agree that without reason you could never understand whether a scenario is right or wrong but you need a basis of what's right and wrong before you can apply reason to it. \n\n \n And you need to be prepared for doubt and uncertainty about what that basis is. There is no absolute standard to appeal to, and you can't abjure the use of reason to try and achieve at least a provisional standard. Experience can make you change your mind, if you are able to learn from experience. Of course, anything humans reason about is going to be subject to error, but that also includes your religious beliefs about your deity. There is no certainty in THAT direction, only the illusion of certainty. \n \n \nWho said it's the fear of God that makes one believe in morality?\n\n \n Many religious apologists with an axe to grind about atheism. They accuse atheists of having no grounds for moral behaviour. Yes, I know that's a stupid accusation, but it is a popular one among apologists.",

Poseidon?\nnegative assurance does not fly. Why should right and wrong rely on human nature?\n \n \nNope. I have reason. What do YOU have? The ruminations of Bronze Age goat-herders? Please.\nReason is not a grounds for anything, it is a tool to be used from those grounded principals. I still stand by the claim that without a God your only sense of right and wrong is selfish desires. It is human nature.",

The answer is apparently yes and thus circular and unreasonable.\n\n \n You keep going around in circles, despite my best efforts to get you on the right track. \n \n The problem you are worrying about here is a version of the problem of induction, which is the problem of how we know we can reason from specific examples to more general conclusions. Another way of stating it is to ask how we know that the laws of nature are consistently applicable for all time, matter and space.\n \n There simply is no solution here through reason alone, because in no system is it apparently possible, according to Goedel, to prove all the assumptions of the system from within the system. Sometimes we have to assume that the axioms are true, and see how far we can get based on that assumption. When we \"see how far we can get\", that's the same as performing empirical experiments or making empirical observations.\n \n What science does, and the science of human nature is no different, is compare our theoretically derived models of reality to reality. The models are arrived at, invented and analysed using reason, but the proof (i.e. test) of the correctness (or otherwise) of the reason is the comparison of the real predictions of the model to reality. Reality is the ultimate judge of human reason.\n \n In the context of how we can know what human rights are necessary to human happiness (and therefore inalienable, if you think as i do that a happy humanity is a good in itself), we have to compare the theoretical consequences of moral systems that assert certain rights or deny others, with the real outcome in real societies. This is what philosophers have done through the ages, and how we arrived at the Enlightenment that introduced the modern concept of human rights. As always in any kind of science, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, or the empirical testing. It doesn't matter how flavorful the pudding promises to be in theory, no matter how closely reasoned the recipe, it doesn't amount to squat until it's baked and tested.\n \n We will probably never be able to formally \"prove\" which asserted human rights are inalienable the way we can formally prove Pythagoras's theorem, but in principle, I believe, we can get about as reliable an estimate of the truth of what they are as we can of the truth of the laws of thermodynamics. I.e. by empirical testing, and that also means using our empathy and insight as a tool. (You might as well ask me how I \"proved\" the laws of thermodynamics are true? I didn't, and no scientist ever did. They have just been so extensively confirmed by repeated testing it would be perverse to doubt them, and so i think it is perverse to doubt certain human rights.)\n \n So yes, empiricism is the way out of the problem of induction. It's the only way out i know of, and so long as empiricism doesn't falsify the axioms used for induction, we can consider them reliable. Even if only provisionally, as a good scientist will. They've worked all this time, and there is no reason to think they will cease to be true.",

But what I have read is fascinating.\n\n \n Yes, that is the scientific method, and I think something similar to it can probably be used to determine what is an inalienable human right or not. Of course, that would still depend on what one defined as \"happiness\", which is another can of worms I won't open today.\n \n Steve seems to be perturbed that one cannot come up with an infallible method for defining human rights, without appealing to his personal god, who apparently tells him things the rest of us aren't privy to. This residual doubt is in the tradition of science -- science isn't in the business of proving theories, it's in the business of building models of the world that seem to work predictively. That means that no theory in science, not even the most commonly accepted, can be considered proven.\n \n So with human rights, we can come to certain conclusions about which rights are essential for human happiness -- the right to marry the consenting person of one's choice being one of them -- without ever being able to prove this absolutely. It's just that a lot of unhappiness is created when this right is violated, and this is something empirically observable.\n \n As to string theory, yes, it is all theory and no practice. I believe the problem is that the energies necessary to test string theory are much higher than any available or planned sources can provide. However, I'm told the theory is very elegant mathematically, and describes what we know of reality as precisely as any other.\n \n Is string theory science? That's a point that's been debated even amongst physicists. To the extent that it is not currently testable, it wouldn't be regarded as science, but on the fringes of science. However, I think the problem of testability is more one of capability than principle, hence it is probably worth pursuing as science in the hope that some way of testing it will eventually show up.",

   "I think Steve needs a brief lesson in circular argument and the use of empiricism to resolve scientific issues. This example comes from the Crevo wars...\n \n Creationists are fond of attacking evolutionary theory as tautologous. Evolution, they say, is defined as the \"survival of the fittest\" (incidentally, that's a phrase coined by Herbert Spencer, not Darwin). Never mind that biologists aren't quite that naive, let's see where this takes us:\n \n Evolution = survival of the fittest. (Premise: fit organisms leave more surviving progeny than unfit organisms.)\n \n How, Creationists then ask, do biologists define fitness?\n \n Why, they answer themselves, by saying it's those who survive! (Conclusion: those with most surviving progeny are the fittest!)\n \n It's a tautology, a circular argument that uses its premise to prove its premise, and therefore irretrievably flawed! It's meaningless., they claim.\n \n Well, even on the face of it, that isn't necessarily true. A tautology is one of the simplest statements in logic: if A=B then B=A. It's an elementary truth, but it doesn't get you anywhere. If evolutionary scientists just sat around solemnly and eternally intoning, \"Evolution is the survival of the fittest; the fittest are those who survive!\", then sure, they'd be going around in circles. But they don't.\n \n They cut through the circularity by applying empirical observation and experiment. They ask what fitness consists of in the context of any environment. They ask what adaptations contribute to fitness, and how much. They measure variation and differential reproductive success of different populations with different adaptations. They look for correlations between the degree of an adaptation and the probability of surviving progeny. They ask how variation is produced. They question, they measure, they test, and they conclude.\n \n In short, they cut through the tangle of pure, tautological reason with the razor of empirical verification. They exit the circularity by appealing to evidence external to the chain of reasoning. One would have to doubt the reality of the external world to deny the utility of this razor.\n \n Religion cannot do this, which is why, I think, Steve is so very anxious to discredit empiricism as a tool for testing reason. Empiricism can be successfully used in science to give it a sound basis in reality, but it has been shown to be totally useless in religion, which remains a work of pure imagination. Theologians can use reason within the systems they construct -- if one accepts their imagined premises.

   "This is fine except when you are using empirical reasoning (which is observation and experiment) to prove reasoning. You use the very thing you are trying to prove to prove it really exists. The \"short\" of it is that you cannot prove reason with reason and that will always be circular without belief. \n\n \n I've told you dozens of times: you cannot solve the problem of induction by pure reason. All you can do is see whether the real world disconfirms it. So far, over centuries and millennia, it has not disconfirmed it. You cannot prove reason by reason; you cannot even prove reason beyond all possible doubt by empiricism; but you can establish one can accept the validity of reason with a certain degree of confidence, if it works consistently in an independent world that lies outside our skulls. To deny that is to deny the reality of the external world, and that way, Steve, lies madness. If you want to go there, bon voyage!\n \n \nI respect you as a poster so don't sink the level of lying. I think empiricism can prove religion and I actually don't discredit it at all. I only discredit the fact that it can be used to prove reasoning. Furthermore, it can't prove the very fundamental basis of understanding (of which reasoning is a part of).\n\n \n You are contradicting yourself. If empiricism cannot be used to \"prove\" reason -- and actually, I agree empiricism in science never \"proves\" a hypothesis, it either disproves it or is consistent with it, a subtle but exptremely important distinction -- then it can't \"prove\" religion for the very same reason!",

   "I think the idea you don't realize you believe in so much is worse than accepting we can't prove everything.\n\n \n Where have i claimed we can prove everything? I've said we can TEST scientific hypotheses, but not most religious ideas.\n \n \nIt also means you can never be sure I am wrong.\n \n \n I'm not 100% sure your religious idea are wrong, but I am so confident they are wrong, I no longer believe them!\n \n \nEmpiricism is only as good as you. And since you can't prove you have any true ability to reason then the assumptions for math, science, and many things in the universe you have beliefs.\n\n \n Of course. That's why science has to be repeatable by others, in one sense or another. What scientists discover must either be strictly repeatable by another scientist in another lab, or at the very least consistent with discoveries by other scientists. If it is neither consistent nor repeatable, then there is probably something wrong somewhere, and only further research will resolve the discrepancy.\n \n Can religion do the same? I really don't think so.\n \n \nFirst off, I'd disagree you can't test religion against reality or at least parts of it. Second point is that if you test against reality you assume reality is what you think it is. Your test is biased from the start when you do this.\n\n \n Well, I was thinking of the more abstract claims of religion that do not refer to reality at all, but yes, whenever religion makes claims about the real world, they can be tested. trouble is, whenever they are tested, 99.9% of the time, they are disproved. The literal interpretation of Genesis is one such sore point among Creationists, where science has exploded a naive interpretation.\n \n And the only really immutable assumption made about reality is that reality is real, and exists objectively outside whatever it is we think it is. What we think of reality is irrelevant to what reality is. If you seriously want to challenge that basic axiom, then you might as well challenge your own sanity. Science is an exercise in trying to find out what reality is, not in making assumptions about it, beyond the assumption that it exists objectively whether we are here to observe it or not.",

   "Well, yeah, that's why science and religion deal with separate realms, and both religion AND science have an unfortunate habit, at times, of treading on each others territory, which is where the trouble happens.\n\n Religion HABITUALLY invades the realm of science. \"Intelligent design\" is all about a religious approach, by definition.\n And we can find numerous examples of the pope and other religious leaders speaking out against evolution.\n \n Religion frequently involves itself in scientific issues.\n \n I have no idea what you think is an example of \"science\" supposedly invading on \"religious\" territory.\n Care to elaborate?\n \n \n \nScience should stick to science, and religion should stick to religion. Pretty simple, really. Science isn't really capable of determining if God was truly behind the act of creation or not.\n\n Nor do I see any indication that science has claimed a position one way or the other.\n The typical problem with that is that some religious people can't handle the idea that we have insight onto the mechanism, and so religious people pretend that the \"big bang\" is somehow encroaching on their territory.\n \n Can you find any credible scientific group (whose actual goal is science) that has taken up an authoritative position on God's involvement?\n \n \n \nIt can tell us how it happened in terms of events and mechanics, but that's all. Meanwhile, religion can't accurately tell us how it happened in terms of events and mechanics.\n\n Although they often pretend they can...\n I remember a story about a religious man who wrote a book of how God could have used evolution in order to form our world today. Trying to bridge the gap.\n \n Did the scientific community throw stones at this man? No.\n It was the RELIGIOUS community that renounced him and treated him like he was speaking heresy.\n \n Your presentment of this issue is trying to compare a claimed anthill to a mountain, and you fail to leave out the size issue in discussing the comparison... emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Science goes wherever it is possible for science to go. Sometimes it finds religion trying to hold the same ground. Would you seriously expect science not to ask questions about the origins of life and the universe because it's an issue religion has historically reserved for itself? I doubt it. If science has something to contribute to our understanding of human morality, should it stay silent because religion also has something to say?\n \n The history of science is one of continuous encroachment on religious territory. Maybe there is some territory science will never successfully invade, but don't be too sure of it.\n\n \n I think you misunderstood what I meant. I'm not suggesting we should limit science in terms of discovery of origins. (Though it certainly should have some ethical limitations at times in what it does, but that's a different debate.)

Depends, I suppose, on exactly how you define \"GOD\". Neither do I claim that science can objectively displace compassionate insight on moral dilemmas.\n \n However, science can illuminate why we are moral animals, and what specific forms our moral senses take. Science is not likely, in my view, ever to provide a prescriptive morality in the sense of telling us infallibly what we ought to do in any given situation, but it probably can explain why we feel the way we do about it, and why we are pulled towards certain resolutions of moral conflicts and resistant to others.\n \n Science can give us a better basis for understanding why humans behave the way they do, though it can't give us prescriptions of how humans ought to behave in every set of circumstances. Science can provide us with the bricks and foundations of human morality; what we build on them is up to culture and personal experience to decide. Try as we might, however, whatever we attempt to build outside the foundations nature has established will not be a stable structure.",
