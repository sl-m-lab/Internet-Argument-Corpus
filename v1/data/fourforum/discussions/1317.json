I'm covering the same topic for a speech that I have to give.\n There aren't really good things, but I guess the school benifits in some ways. The school gets more money, and i'm assuming that some of the money goes to the teachers, so that might be a plus. Also, supposedly, the children who are challenged are getting more attention. \n All of the following benifits I'm listing are from what politicians say about it:\n The leaders of the school know their students better,\n The parents have a vague idea of what their children are doing in school,\n The government knows what schools need more attention and/or resources,\n Teacher know their students level of learning....\n \n My response to all of them is \"Riiiiiiiiight....\" but they may be something to go off of. There is really nothing good about it, so BSing might be a good idea ;)",

The requirements include:\n \n * Annual testing of all students against state standards in reading and mathematics in grades 3-8 and in science at three times in a student's school career (including once in high school).\n * \"Verification\" of each state's assessment system via required participation (every other year) by selected districts in the NAEP test.\n * Aggregate and disaggregate analysis and reporting of student achievement results.\n * A state definition and timeline for determining whether a school, district and the state are making \"adequate yearly progress\" (AYP) toward the goal of 100 percent of students meeting state standards by the 2013-2014 school year.\n * Technical assistance and then sanctions for schools, districts and the state for failure to make AYP.\n * Highly qualified teachers in core academic subjects by 2005-2006.\n * Highly qualified aides or paraprofessionals.\n * Support for students not meeting standards and/or for those who have special needs (e.g., homeless, limited-English-proficiency).\n * The use of \"scientifically-based\" programs and strategies.\n \n http://www.isbe.state.il.us/nclb/htmls/highlights.htm",

   "Hi JP,\n \n Could you explain your last post to me? That \"Whooshing\" shound was your statement going over my head....\n \n Sounds like it might be a quote to remember....\n\n \n Sorry, I was speaking in statistician doublespeak. :)\n Metrics is the statisticians way of saying a measuring system, or means to measure something. For example, if you are looking at the length of an object, a ruler or some other device graduated in units of measure would be employed.\n \n Noise is the statistician's term for random scatter in the data without \"assignable cause\". Darn, there I go again with that doublespeak.\n Assignable Cause is when you can look at data that falls outside of the normal range and can explain why it does. For example, 10 people use ruler A and measures 10\" for the length of an object and an 11th person measures 12\" for the same object using ruler B. They examine ruler B and find out the scale is off. They can then assign a cause for the 11th person's differing measurement.\n \n So, in a nutshell, I said that without a good means of measuring differences and the causes for those differences in data, a bad datapoint can't be \"assigned\", so it is just \"noise\".\n Still confused?\n emoticon_confused \n \n If so, I can try to explain it again. Statistics is full of tough concepts to visualize, so don't feel bad if the above doesn't help.",
