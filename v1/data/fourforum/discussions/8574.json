   "www.flagburning.com\n \n Flag Burning is our Patriotic Duty \n \n \n There comes a point when the citizens, Acting as the Fourth Branch of Government, have a duty to their country to rise up and slap the government down when it gets out of line. We must never forget that the government exists for only one purpose, and that is to serve the people. That the government and the courts derive their powers by the consent of the people, and that the government has a duty to put the Will of the People above it's own self interests. When the government fails, it is the duty and the responsibility of the people to put the government in it's place and let the government know that it is, in fact subservient to the people. \n \n Our forefathers did not fight and die to preserve the flag, but rather they fought and died to protect our right to burn it, just as our founding fathers did to the British flag. The burning of the flag is an act that asserts the right of the people over the government. The denial of the right to burn the flag is the assertion of the government to rule the people. America is ruled by the people, not the government, and it is in fact our patriotic duty, at this juncture to assert that duty. \n \n \n Flag Burning is a patriotic act done by people who care deeply enough about our freedoms to challenge the government when it becomes a threat to the people. Patriots who love America burn flags. \n \n In the 1960s the government got itself trapped in the Vietnam War (police action) and was unable to get itself out. The systems of government failed to make itself do what was right. But the people, in order to preserve the nation, rose up against the government, forcing it to act in a lawful and responsible manner. In this case the electoral college has failed to produce a result that anyone can rely on. This is a failure of the methods of the Constitution itself. Now we have opportunists who would usurp the power of the people, who have clearly spoke their intent through the popular vote, and substitute a process that has failed. That is not acceptable. \n It might be different if the electoral system produced a clear winner, even if it disagreed with the popular vote. That would have been a different situation. But the electoral system didn't produce a clear winner. It failed! And we must admit that it failed. If Gore, by some chance were to have won under the electoral system, and he could have if he had a spine (as electors are people and free to vote as they choose) then the Bush supporters should have burned the flag. The process, as applied to these circumstances is unfair, and the courts have a duty to declare the process void. If they fail to do their duty, it is our duty to enforce the Will of the People on the courts. \n \n \n When the electoral system fails to produce a result that the people can rely on, we must go with the popular vote. \n \n George Bush lost this election. He lost the popular vote, and he lost the Florida vote. But because his brother is governor and the secretary of State is going to get to be an ambassador, the vote was manipulated to produce a false result. I will not accept Bush as president (Al Gore does not speak for me on this issue) and if he is installed in that office then this country will not be my country and I will treat the government as an occupying foreign power and that a coup has occurred. \n I therefore urge all loyal citizens to make it clear to the Republican controlled press that we will not accept this and that we are prepared to burn the flag to make our voices heard. I call on all of you to begin organizing a massive flag burning to be held at the moment Bush is sworn in. And maybe some burnings sooner. When the government becomes the lawbreaker then there is no law. \n \n \n The United States Supreme Court will now be known as the Republican Supreme Court. \n \n I have to agree with this statement; \"Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law\", Justice Stevens of the United States supreme court, in his dissenting opinion. You got that right sucker! And if you think we're just going to sit here and let it happen, you're wrong. \n I need someone to produce an animated flag burning gif file for me to post and distribute. \n \n \n \n -http://www.flagburning.org/-\n \n \n can you guys read this and tell me what you think.. I think its crazy but thast me being \"American & Patriotic\" so excuse me if im not fulfilling my duty as an American. This takes freedom of speech to some extremes",

   "So should Klan members be allowed to burn crosses in front of black Churches? If it's their wood and they are not harming anyone, what's the difference?\n \n For the people who say the flag is just a piece of fabric, than the word nigger is just a word and the swastika is just a plus sign doing cartwheels. I find it funny to see the same people arguing that burning a flag is ok, but someone displaying a Confederate flag in the back window of their pick-up truck is a slap in the face to all black people. If I can burn a flag, can I yell fire in a crowded theatre? It's my freedom of speech, right? If I can burn the American flag, why not urinate on a POW flag? Wait, that's going too far...isn't it? It's my freedoms!!! But it doesn't mean I should.\n \n Personally, I think burning any nation's flag is wrong. It's disrespectful and is a lame way to get attention for yourself. There are many other ways you can get attention to your cause without desecrating a flag. Of course, since this country is free, I believe it should be legal. People have the right to do and say what they want, even sad disrespectful things.\n \n If the American flag means nothing to you, that's fine. If all you see when you look at the flag is oil, Iraq and Bush that's your opinion. But try and think of the mother who all she has left of her son is a flag. Think of the veterans who look at that flag and see their fallen comrades when retreat plays everyday. Think of all the times that flag rushed into battle against the British and was the last one standing.

Shame on you for speaking out so vocally over a piece of cloth when people are wearing tattered rags because they have no jobs to earn money to buy clothing.

See the Supreme Court's website for the explanation. In no way does burning a flag endanger someone's life, unless you wrap it around them first, so the two are not the same. The second is protected under the First Amendment, the first is not.\n \n It is not required by law that one pledge allegiance to the flag, and those of you who are biblically-minded should likely beware that sort of thing if it were.

   "Yeah, fine; their intent was that there would be and amendment process. But you aren't seriously claiming that they intended for blacks to vote, but just didn't get around to it, are you?

It looks like you won by default, from what I read last night.\n\n \n Whats the argument here? The anti-federalists were the ones that wanted a Bill of Rights and the federalists thought it was a bad idea since it might be exploited to expand federal power. To prevent this, the 9th and 10th amendments were created but have been pretty much ignored. \n \n As for flag burning, I bet you could make an argument that the first amendment doesn't prohibit a state from burning the flag. You would have to argue that the 14th amendment didn't apply the amendments to the states and thus free speech is not a state issue and you could ban it.",

   "There's no argument. It's just that someone seemed to take exception to my claiming that it's silly for people to constantly be using the \"founder's intent\" as justification for present-day arguments.\n Like I said, it's fine to say that their \"intent\" was that there be an amendment process. No one's disputing that. But just because they intended, and implemented, that process doesn't justify extrapolating their views on a hundred different subjects like abortion, flag-burning, etc., which seems to be what zachvac was implying: \nPart of that Constitution was also the amendment process. That's part of the Constitution and perfectly valid as part of what the intent of people was.\n\n As precise as they were, it seems as if they'd have pointed it out at the time if they'd had definite views on those subjects.\n I could personally care less if someone burns a flag. I don't worship any idols, and I don't revere it as a symbol of much, because what it could be construed as symbolizing changes from decade to decade. To me it's not much more than a graphical representation of 13 colonies and 50 states. I don't place any more significance or importance on any flag than I do the logo on a pack of Wrigley's.\n The insane prevalance, lately, of so many ribbons on cars strikes me as meaningless and jingoistic. If you love your country, love it. If you love freedom, love it. If you support freedom of speech, learn to shut up when others exercise it.\n Ban flag-burning, and you then have to ban the destruction of any of the other symbols of the US: the Presidential Seal, images of Bald Eagles, etc. Where would it stop?",
