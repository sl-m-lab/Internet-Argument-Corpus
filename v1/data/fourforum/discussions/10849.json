So don't even insult me by claiming that the science we disagree on is science at all. because it isn't.

The reality is that I have questioned evolution with an open mind since I was a child.

That's science and it's real, testable and reliable.

If your equations that actually were provable, that state the age of the Universe at between 10 and 20 billion years old, you would still be blowing smoke as a 10 billion year gap between what might be is solid evidence that you don't know anything that is provable, or that has been proven at all, in any way. And for you then to go from those conclusions to aging the Earth and then to aging when when life appeared, to when Man appeared, allows for such huge unprovable assumptions all stemming from the original 10 billion year gap that you originally admit is the closest you can come to determining when the big bang, if it ever actually occurred, did occur. \n \n Now who are you calling intellectually dishonest again? \n \nThe fact that you refuse to be convinced says everything about you, and nothing about the arguments used against you.

What they cannot reconcile is that fact that their entire belief system is contradictory. Furthermore, if you belief in literal genesis, your belief logically demands God is an deceitful liar. No creationist I've brought that up against could even begin to argue against it.

   "If just one equation is wrong, or if one fossil is misinterpreted, then all the facts resulting from that interpretation are wrong. And if those facts are used to make future extrapolations leading to more mistaken conclusions, well, then what you have are the delusional assumptions that evolutionists cling to so rabidly today.\n\n Technically, you're wrong. If I prove that two plus two equals four using flawed reasoning, then that doesn't disprove that two plus two equals four, it just removes that reason to believe that two plus two equals four. But you haven't shown any flaw in the mathematical proof. Or, in context, you haven't given us a SINGLE DAMN INSTANCE of such an incorrect equation. You haven't shown us a SINGLE DAMN INSTANCE of an incorrectly interpreted piece of evidence still being used to support a theory. So we're right unless we're wrong, and all we do is eliminate our mistakes, and you can't show any instance where we're still messing up, but you expect us to just throw it out the window because you want us to? And you think that I'm arrogant? ### is wrong with you?\n \n \nSure, real science works, and real science's testable results are absolute and consistent. That's why my car starts every time when it is running right. That's why the light comes on every time I turn the switch on. That's why my stove heats up every time I set the nob to a certain temp. And that's why the same station comes on when I set my radio dial to the same spot. That is real science and it works just fine in reality. \n \n But the so called sciences evolution, abiogenesis, Cosmology and Quantum physics are theoretical belief systems of one degree or another that presume facts that are in no way in evidence which is why they are the only sciences that must constantly readjust the realities they claim are true. And just because you build into your pseudo science the concept of trial and error and new conclusions based on new info does nothing to prove it is either real or reliable. Especially when real science doe come to absolute conclusions as I have shown above.\n\n See, Archie, here's where I get to take your complete ignorance of science and BEAT YOU MERCILESSLY OVER THE HEAD WITH IT. I'll wait until I'm done to give you the big pointy hat and sit you in the corner.\n You love that light switch, don't you? Controls the flow of electrons to the light bulb, which converts the electric energy into EM radiation that illuminates the room. Do you want to know what explains this process? this oh-so-reliable, Archie-loved, great-example process?\n \n Quantum physics. Everything about this wonderful process that YOU, BY YOUR OWN EXAMPLE, LOVE SO MUCH is explained best by quantum physics. Behavior of particles, interconversion of particles and energy, electromagnetic radiation that illuminates the room... Quantum physics, Holmes.\n \n Hey Archie, do you want to know why your engine starts? Do you know what explains the changes in the chemicals that you put into your engine as it converts them to energy? Would you like to know how scientists describe the physical interactions between parts that make your car's engine run? We can do it with quantum physics. In fact, no other previously tried method describes these things as well as quantum mechanics does. QM can even make predictions about the real world, which is an important test for validity.\n \n But, no, QM is just worthless, unsupported pseudoscience, according to Archie. Just more blather from people smarter than him who actually give a damn about the world instead of their own imagined salvation.\n \n Get your head out of your XXX, Archie; I have a pointy hat for you to wear.\n \n \nAs for my macbook, that is another perfect example of real science that is testable and consistent as it works every time. If real science in the real World was as unreliable and theoretical as the science you rely on to explain our origins, we would still be living in the stone age.\n\n How's that stone age macbook working out for you? Take a guess how we can explain the particle interactions in the transistors that make that thing work... Go ahead... Now guess what we use to predict what will happen when we build something new like the next version of your macbook...\n \n What makes this especially funny is that Archie went nuts on me because he accused me of being unaware of multiverse possibilities... which is derived from a possible interpretation of QM, which he has repeatedly said is bunk.\n \n \nSo don't even insult me by claiming that the science we disagree on is science at all. because it isn't.\n\n If you are insulted by your own lack of science knowledge... you should be.\n \n \nNot one appliance, electronic toy, fixture or utility in my home is made up of fossils, comets, star material\n\n They're all made up of the same things, actually. But you don't know that because you keep yourself ignorant of astronomy.\n \n \nOnly your sciences that explain our alleged origins and evolutionary steps require constant corrections to remain consistent with your preconceived assumptions.\n\n 1850s: Mankind, and all life, evolved from a common ancestor.\n 2008: Mankind, and all life, evolved from a common ancestor.\n Wow! Look at all of that tweaking and correcting! I'm ashamed!\n \n \nThe reality is that I have questioned evolution with an open mind since I was a child. But all through the years when I asked common sense questions I was told that you don't ask those questions, they aren't relevant.\n\n What you call \"common sense\" is nothing of the sort. You don't even know enough about evolution to question it, and you prefer to keep it that way.\n \n \nAnd again, I say BALDERDASH SQUARED TIMES 10. My lights work every time I turn them on,\n\n QM.\n \n \nyour evolution doesn't work at all yet, and it never will because the numbers just don't add up, and they never will.\n\n Oh, so you can show us where our formulas or calculations are wrong? Really?\n \n \nOh really? I have a buddy who can explain the complete scientific process for the creation and distribution of the electrical current that powers my home all the way back to its source of creation through its travels to my home. That's science and it's real, testable and reliable.\n\n Then he'll tell you concepts of QM, which you think is bunk.\n \n \nOnly your hoo-doo science that fits with your atheistic theology is based totally on theoretical guess work that you hope will one day be proven true.\n\n Like gravity? Completely void of any mention of God, yet you don't rail against that, do you?\n \n \nYes Otto, but what if the math the equations are based on is wrong?\n\n Oh, so NOW you can show which equations are wrong and why? Oh.. you can't. Imagine my shock.\n So keep calling us dishonest hacks, Archie, while you spew this bullspit about maths being wrong WITH NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER. Flaming hypocrisy knows no bounds with you. Put that hat back on.\n \n \nProve me wrong if you can, or prove your assumptions are right if you can.\n\n Okay. Every single cross-checking dating method gives us consistent results. Read Age of the Earth by Brent Dalrymple.\n \n \nBetter still take another hundred years and maybe you'll have more tangible evidence then, or maybe Jesus will have returned by then and this whole debate will be moot as you will then understand the truth as I know it exists.\n\n Jesus makes science untrue? What an XXX. \"I made you believe these things by putting evidence in place and giving you the ability to reason. Turns out I wanted you to be an ignorant dunce and blindly follow my book. I am awesome, glory be to me. Now burn in hell, you gullible schmuck.\"\n \n \nSure Talk Origins is using fake science. It is way less provable than my first hand personal experiences with the living God.\n\n Lie. Anybody can repeat many of the experiments that T.O uses. I can't repeat your experiences.\n \n \nAnd i can say that with confidence because with all of the so called combined evidence that you can produce from various sources that seemingly agrees with each other, the foundation upon which it is all based is false and unprovable.\n\n Oh, so NOW you can show where we've made mista-- oh.. still no, huh? Still blowing smoke out of your XXX, I see.\n \n \nYou prove Talk origins is not using fake science.\n\n Prove a negative? Well, we never said you were good with logic. \n \n \nIt takes both gaul and nerve...\n\n To pretend to know stuff that you don't, even if it's as simple as spelling?",

   "You prove Talk origins is not using fake science. You first made the statement. See:\n\n \n I also talked about fluid mechanics which is covered in talk origins and often cited as a reason why the flood did not occur.\n \n \nYou're a joke child, a bad joke, but a joke none the less. And this is precisely the dishonest games you play that cause me to ignore your posts. Now I insist that you post where I attacked fluid mechanics in the prior post that you responded to here!\n\n \n It would help if you bothered to even check out Talkorigins before insulting it and call it wrong. A fair portion of talkorigins has little to do with biology or evolution. Much of it deals with physics and non-organic chemistry and geology, such as fluid mechanics. Since you stated that talk origins relies on false, unprovable science, you must also believe that fluid mechanics, and the greater physics world is fake and unprovable. I can list a wide variety of non-biological sciences that are covered in talkorigins, but know you'll pretend you never made this argument.\n \n Start fact checking and you'd stop having egg all over your face all of the time. \n \n \nAgain, prove I ever brought up fluid mechanics in fact or even by example. That is the epitome of philosophical cowardice and you create false dichotomies to argue in every debate you participate in. It takes both gaul and nerve to raise an issue to argue that I never even raised when all anyone has to do is go back to the prior post you're responding to and see that fluid mechanics was never remotely mentioned by me as even a principle of science or an example in the debate.\n\n \n You claimed this:\n \nSure Talk Origins is using fake science.\n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html\n \n A portion of that article discusses fluid mechanics. \n \n Therefore since you reject talk origins as using fake science, you therefore believe that fluid mechanics is fake science.\n \n Your basic problem is that you never, ever, ever bother to actually research what you are talking about. Hence why it is so easy for us to destroy you. If you bothered to look up what talkorigins discussed, you'd see that a large number of articles deal with the age of the universe, which is not biology, the realm of physics and astronomy, again, not biology and chemistry somewhat, again not biology. Since you stated that the entire site is using fake science, you must therefore belief that physics, geology, and chemistry are fake sciences.\n \n The fact that you've been embarrassed on numerous occasions for not fact checking should tell you that maybe you should start. \n \n \nIt's impossible to win a debate with someone like you who twists facts, edits the posts you respond to and reinterprets what the opposition states before answering with info that has nothing at all to do with what the other person even said. Debating with you is like debating with a schizophrenic who didn't take his meds. You bring up imaginary issues I never even responded to. :xbanghead\n\n \n Read above. \n \n You clearly did not check out what talkorigins was about and made a poor assumption. Thus you are paying for it. \n \n [quoteJust disagreeing with you is taken as a threat.

   "Archangel, what is your understanding of \"peer review\"? \n \n Because certainly, the way it was described in the intro post is ridiculous, just another example of creationist revisionist linguistics, deceit and deception.\n\n \n Hi Dane, welcome to 4forums. Peer Review regarding evolutionary science is nothing more that a group of fellow charlatans rubber stamping what another charlatan submitted for approval to further the scam and lie of evolutionary science for the unwashed masses whom they seek to con into accepting this false science. \n \n I submit the 40 year support the Piltdown Man enjoyed as evidence of such collusion within the scientific community because Piltdown Man supported the preconceived notions of evolutionary science at large. It wasn't until Piltdown Man no longer fit into the accepted paradigm that it was shown to be the scam that it is. And even then the results that it was a scam was with held from the public for decades more until it could just no longer be concealed any longer.\n \n http://home.tiac.net/~cri_a/piltdown/piltdown.html\n \n From the same link, here is a rundown of the original evidence upon which the theory of evolution rests. It is very telling how LITTLE original evidence was available for such an all encompassing current discipline of the study to exist today.\n The Story Of The Hoax\n \n In following the history of the hoax it is useful to have a time line showing the principal events.

Report ignored.\n 1929 -- First skull of Peking man found.\n 1934 -- Ramapithecus discovered\n 1935 -- Many (38 individuals) Peking man fossils have been found.\n 1935 -- Swanscombe man [genuine] discovered.\n 1937 -- Marston attacks Piltdown age estimate, cites Edmonds.\n 1941 -- Peking man fossils lost in military action.\n 1943 -- Fluorine content test is first proposed.\n 1948 -- Woodward publishes The Earliest Englishman\n 1949 -- Fluorine content test establishes Piltdown man as relatively recent.\n 1951 -- Edmonds report no geological source for Piltdown animal fossils.\n 1953 -- Weiner, Le Gros Clark, and Oakley expose the hoax.\n In 1856 the first Neanderthal fossil discovery was made and the hunt was on to find fossil remains of human ancestors. In the next half century finds were made in continental Europe and in Asia but not in Britain. Finally, in 1912, the sun rose on British paleontology -- fossil remains of an ancient pleistocene hominid were found in the Piltdown quarries in Sussex. In the period 1912 to 1915 the Piltdown quarries yielded two skulls, a canine tooth, and a mandible of Eoanthropus, a tool carved from an elephant tusk, and fossil teeth from a number of pleistocene animals.\n \n There is a certain vagueness about some of the critical events. Dawson contacted Woodward about the first two skull fragments which were supposedly found by workman \"some years prior\". Exactly when is unknown. Similarly, the discovery of Piltdown II is shrouded in mystery. Supposedly Dawson and an anonymous friend make the discovery 1915; however the friend and the location of the find are unknown.\n \n The reaction to the finds was mixed. On the whole the British paleontologists were enthusiastic; the French and American paleontologists tended to be skeptical, some objected quite vociferously. The objectors held that the jawbone and the skull were obviously from two different animals and that their discovery together was simply an accident of placement. In the period 1912-1917 there was a great deal of skepticism. The report in 1917 of the discovery of Piltdown II converted many of the skeptics; one accident of placement was plausible -- two were not.\n \n It should be remembered that, at the time of Piltdown finds, there were very few early hominid fossils; Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens were clearly fairly late. It was expected that there was a \"missing link\" between ape and man. It was an open question as to what that missing link would look like. Piltdown man had the expected mix of features, which lent it plausibility as a human precursor.\n \n This plausibility did not hold up. During the next two decades there were a number of finds of ancient hominids and near hominids, e.g. Dart's discovery of Australopithecus, the Peking man discoveries, and other Homo erectus and australopithecine finds. Piltdown man did not fit in with the new discoveries. None the less, Sir Arthur Keith (a major defender of Piltdown man) wrote in 1931:\n \n It is therefore possible that Piltdown man does represent the early pleistocene ancestor of the modern type of man, He may well be the ancestor we have been in search of during all these past years. I am therefore inclined to make the Piltdown type spring from the main ancestral stem of modern humanity...\n In the period 1930-1950 Piltdown man was increasingly marginalized and by 1950 was, by and large, simply ignored. It was carried in the books as a fossil hominid. From time to time it was puzzled over and then dismissed again. The American Museum of Natural History quietly classified it as a mixture of ape and man fossils. Over the years it had become an anomaly; some prominent authors did not even bother to list it. In Bones of Contention Roger Lewin quotes Sherwood Washburn as saying\n \n \"I remember writing a paper on human evolution in 1944, and I simply left Piltdown out. You could make sense of human evolution if you didn't try to put Piltdown into it.\"\n Finally, in 1953, the roof fell in. Piltdown man was not an ancestor; it was not a case of erroneous interpretation; it was a case of outright deliberate fraud.\n So as you can see Dane, the agreement by the complete evolutionary scientific community that a discovery is real means very little in reality that it is actually true or that in 50 years it wont be shown to be a complete fraud.",

   "And here is another link that explains the over all questionable outcomes and so called evidence that this pseudo science is based upon. Given this information, it is only responsible to question the very foundation upon which evolutionary science is built. Here is an excerpt.\n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu6JJkaBH5MwAHJRXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExcDQ1bmxqBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=12k9loh99/EXP=1201791689/**http%3a//www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_expose/the_missing_link.html\n Archaeology is the study of remnants and artefacts of the past. The discipline emerged in the eighteenth century as part of the historiographical revolution seeking truly authentic modes of access into history. The word 'monument' covered literary as well as concrete relics: ancient manuscripts as well as time-encrusted artefacts and human remains. Most of the literary forgers of the eighteenth century were producers of historical fiction which evolved from and satisfied many of the needs of contemporary literary-historical inquiry. In doing so the forgeries laid bare the processes of evaluation and judgement concerning 'genuine' art that might not otherwise have been subjected to scrutiny.\n \n Archaeological forgery is a tangible form of historical fiction. There were no archaeological fakes in the eighteenth century because the discipline had not become a central cultural activity. This happened in the nineteenth century. There were major discoveries, the most famous being Heinrich Schliemann's supposed discovery of Homer's Troy in 1873. This incident is particularly ironic for our purposes. Not only had Schliemann not uncovered Priam's fabled city (but a much earlier one)-but it has recently been revealed that Schliemann's discovery of the fabulous treasure which became world famous was a hoax.\n \n The complexion of this forgery is very interesting. Most of the treasure was genuine in the sense of being genuinely old. The relics were not modern fabrications. Some of them probably came from the site of excavation, others were from other sites or even bought from dealers. The treasure was a forgery because its provenance was false. Schliemann even inserted the fictitious tale of discovery into his own diary. This revelation opens up the [92] whole question of unreliable memoirs, and of the complicity of biographers who fail to check information in the proper way. Schliemann's treasure of Troy was not what it appeared to be. The parts were genuine but the whole was fictional. Schliemann forged authentication and invented a context. His activity shows how significant external factors are in producing the authenticity of a relic. One of these factors is of course the market. The value of relics like works of art is estimated in financial as well as cultural terms. Also a great deal of national prestige is attached to archaeological discoveries. Schliemann was lionised by the civilised world. He had abused his authority to achieve greater recognition. He made 'a dream discovery ... what every archaeologist wants to find' (David Trail speaking on 'Chronicle', BBC 2, 31 July 1984). That is the feeling behind the quest that occupied many nineteenth- and early twentieth-century archaeologists in a different area: the search for the first human being. People thought Schliemann had transformed Homer's fiction into fact. The same incarnation awaited our evolutionary parent-a figure who, ironically, had only recently been invented.\n \n The archaeological equivalent of a Shakespeare manuscript in the nineteenth century was a fossilised relic of an early human. Advances in geology and zoology had produced the idea of evolution: natural and human life had begun in a simpler, common form, and had become gradually diversified and sophisticated over an immense amount of time. The theory was very controversial, contradicting orthodox religious accounts of creation. Moreover, evolutionary theory posited that humans were once a much more primitive form of animal, something resembling a modern primate such as an ape.\n \n In 1856 in Germany a skull was discovered near the river Neander which had a human-like jaw and overhanging, simian brows. This 'Neanderthal Man' seemed to confirm the existence of an ape-like ancestor for humankind, living on the earth several hundred thousand years ago. In 1859 Charles Darwin finally published The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. The book was the most authoritative statement so far of evolutionary change in history. Though Darwin did not include humanity in the picture until The Descent of Man (1871), he was popularly credited with the 'monkey theory' of [93] our ancestry. The primitive human, monkey-like or not, was a burning issue among scientists after The Origin of Species. There was a need to find very ancient human remains, particularly a skull or part of a skull. The intensity of this need can be judged by the appearance outside Britain of three forgeries all produced in the decade after the Origin. All three were fabricated remnants of a primeval human-in effect, historical fictions.\n \n The first of these forgeries occurred at Moulin-Quignon, near Abbeville in France, in 1863. A site was being excavated by Boucher de Perthes, an archaeologist committed to the existence of fossilised human remains. He had previously unearthed flint tools in the same stratum of earth as the bones of extinct animals. This was evidence that humans had existed at this very ancient time, and that somewhere their bodies-not only accoutrements-must be buried. He turned his attention on Moulin-Quignon, and offered a reward of 200 francs for any labourer who found a human remain. In March 1863 a workman gave Boucher de Perthes a human tooth and the relevant authenticating assortment of flints and fossils. The spot where the discovery had been made was excavated exhaustively, and soon presented the lower half of a human jaw. Boucher de Perthes had found a prehistoric human. The discovery was hailed nationally and archaeologists and anthropologists flocked to the site. They were disappointed, but the Moulin-Quignon jaw was given a prestigious place in the Academy of Sciences.\n \n Doubts as to the authenticity of the jaw were soon raised, particularly in England, and fierce nationalist bickering broke out. Some of the flints found alongside the jaw proved to be fakes. A black market of fake archaeological relics already existed, an automatic response to the high prices being offered by museums and collectors. Indeed it was in England at exactly this time that the most famous flint faker Edward 'Flint Jack' Simpson was at work. An untold number of his fakes permeated the market, and it was only because of his own confession that anyone ever found out. Flint Jack gave a public demonstration of his skill in 1862 which earned him sincere praise by Llewellyn Jewitt in the Reliquary Quarterly Archaeological Journal and Review.\n \n [94] antiquaries owe him a debt of gratitude for opening their eyes to deception, and for\n \n showing them how a lost art may be restored ... the man possesses more real\n \n practical antiquarian knowledge than many of the leading antiquarian writers of the day,\n \n and he is a good geologist and palaeontologist. (quoted in Cole, 1955, p. 79)\n \n The Moulin-Quignon fake was not seen so positively. A scientific analysis of the amount of organic matter in the jaw proved it to be modern. Hence the forgery had led to one of the first independent dating tests. The Anthropological Society of London was relieved. The magnitude of what was at stake was expressed by Sir John Evans (father of Sir Arthur Evans, the discoverer of Minoan Crete) in the Athenaeum. His fears are very reminiscent of Thomas Warton's grave prophecies about the wrong outcome of the Chatterton controversy:\n \n It may be asked why, when so many genuine flint implements had been found in the\n \n beds of Moulin Quignon ... it was worth taking so much trouble to prove that a certain\n \n small number of implements reputed to have been found there were false. To this I\n \n reply that trivial as the question may appear, the consequences of a wrong answer\n \n to it are most important. For if these implements, without a solitary sign of antiquity\n \n about them, had been determined to be undoubtedly genuine, we should then\n \n have had no characteristics left whereby to distinguish true from false, and should have\n \n been at the mercy of every flint knapper and gravel digger who thought fit to impose upon us.\n \n (Athenaeum, 6 dune 1863; quoted in Cole, p. 125)",

Give it a read some time. It's dull, but doesn't use too many scientific terms; you could probably follow most of it.\n\n \n And speaking of Neanderthal Man:\n The Neanderthal Problem\n \n There were reports in the general news media that \"you're not a Neanderthal after all\"1 because \"we didn't mate with Neanderthals\".2 We will discuss the study3 that prompted these reports later, and let you decide whether the DNA study results are conclusive or not. But first, you need to know why it is so important to evolutionists to prove that Neanderthal4 man is a separate species, and not our ancestor.\n \n The first Neanderthal skeleton was discovered in 1856, just three years before the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species. The nineteenth century evolutionists believed that apes evolved into some sub-human missing links, which evolved into man. Naturally, Neanderthal man was immediately assumed to be one of those missing links and was depicted as at the right.\n \n The more scientists learned about Neanderthal man, the more they realized he did not fit in with their theory very well. Apes supposedly got smarter as their brains gradually evolved in size from about 400 cc to modern man's 1350 cc brain.5 It was difficult to explain how a Neanderthal man, with his 1740 cc brain6, fit into this process.\n \n The Neanderthal skeletons were found in graves with hands neatly folded, surrounded by fossilized pollen. This is a pretty clear indication that they were buried with flowers in some sort of funeral ceremony. Only humans do that. Furthermore, they found tools (and possibly a musical instrument7) associated with some of the Neanderthal remains. Every indication was that he was as fully human as Homo sapiens (modern man).\n \n But worst of all was the time problem. According to the evolutionists' dating, Homo sapiens supposedly evolved 100,000 years ago.8 Some people even claim there is evidence of Homo sapiens in Australia 116,000 to 176,000 years ago.9 Neanderthal man supposedly lived from 36,000 to 75,000 years ago,10 or maybe as long as 82,000 years ago.11 Homo sapiens could not have evolved from Neanderthals if Homo sapiens were here first. Even if you assume that Neanderthals existed more than 176,000 years ago, but their fossils just haven't been discovered yet, that's still a problem because the theory requires the inferior species to die out for the superior species to evolve.\n \n Here's why death is necessary for evolution: Suppose that you, through some extremely fortunate (we have to carefully avoid the adjective \"miraculous\" ) chance, acquire a new, beneficial gene by random mutation. Since you produce children through a sexual process in which your children inherit half of your genes and half of your spouse's genes, the odds are that only half of your children will acquire the marvelous new gene. One quarter of your grandchildren will acquire it; one eighth of your great-grandchildren will acquire it; and so on. Your marvelous new gene will not become a dominant characteristic in future generations.\n \n But suppose that it is a cruel world, and many children don't survive. The half of your children who have the marvelous new gene will win the battle for survival. Your children without the new gene, and all your neighbor's children, will die before they mature enough to have children. Your sons and daughters will have no choice but to marry their sisters and brothers who have the new gene, so the new characteristic provided by this new gene will become established in the population.\n \n We may have over-simplified the process a little bit too much, but that's the theory of evolution in a nut shell (a particularly appropriate metaphor, in this case). Evolution depends upon death to weed out the genes of the inferior race so that the superior race can become established.\n \n Neanderthal man and modern man could not live together for tens of thousands of years, interbreeding with each other, without the races blending. Therefore, the evolutionists have to believe that Neanderthal man and modern man were distinct species, incapable of interbreeding.\n \n Evolutionists have held this belief for several years, even before the questionable DNA study. For example, it has been argued that nasal features indicate that modern man and Neanderthal man were separate species.\n \n \"It is mind-boggling how different Neandertal nasal structures are from those of humans\", [Jeffery H.] Schwartz [of the University of Pittsburgh] holds. 12\n From his choice of words it is clear that Schwartz didn't consider Neanderthals to be human.\n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu.gMnaBH7pIAW11XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExbTV0dDR1BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=129gioci6/EXP=1201794700/**http%3a//www.ridgecrest.ca.us/~do_while/sage/v1i12f.htm\n \n And isn't it interesting that our less advanced ancestor had a larger brain than we do. And similar but unique problems exist with every other type of alleged descendant of Modern Man. All of which you ignore of course.",

It provides 'a way out of an impasse', says Salvador Moya-Sola and Meike Kohler of the Institute of Palaeontology in Sabadell near Barcelona (Nature, 7 October, p 543). But Moya-Sola and Kohler's solution to the evolutionary problem is unexpected, and may raise more questions than it answers.\n \n Their theory that Dryopithecus was on the orang-utan line of evolution means that it probably played no part in human evolution. They say that Dryopithecus was a close relative of another extinct ape called Sivapithecus and kin forms (some of them once called Ramapithecus) from Turkey, India and Pakistan.\n \n Before the recent Spanish discovery, the belief was that Dryopithecus was a primitive ape with no close living relatives. One theory is that it shared an ancestor with African great apes (chimpanzees and gorillas) and human beings, which means it evolved after the orang-utan line branched off about 15 to 13 million years ago.\n \n Another theory is that Dryopithecus was more primitive still and shared an ancestor with all great apes - that is, it evolved before the Asian and African lineages of great apes diverged but after the gibbons (lesser apes) split off.\n \n The Spanish skull is not complete but it has features, especially in the cheekbone and ear regions, that were unclear in previous fossils of Dryopithecus, which were even more incomplete. This makes a reinterpretation of the apes' affinities is now possible.\n \n The skull was pieced together from fragments by Moya-Sola and Kohler. The reconstructed specimen includes much of the face and upper jawbones, the bony covering of an ear and part of the back of the skull. It belonged to a species called Dryopithecus laietanus.\n \n Most other specimens of this extinct ape - from elsewhere in the Valles Penedes and also from sites in southern France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Hungary and possibly China - consist of bits and pieces of skulls, jaws, teeth and a few limb fragments.\n Please take note the incompleteness of the fossils being studied and the amount of reconstruction needed in order to determine their relationship with Modern Man. And we all know that when they find a fossil lacking an ear canal structure, that they interpret what should go their in their reconstruction process. So what they end up with is not necessarily what existed in reality in the species being reconstructed. This is why i say with confidence that nothing that you assume, conclude, claim or hold up as evidence of evolution is proven or conclusive at all. It is all speculation based on evolutionary sciences desire to prove what they have pre-ordained to be presumed to be true, but is in no way proven as for example, it has been proven how the science behind the internal combustion engine is proven and reliable.",

That's simply not how it works. If you're genuinely interested in gaining a better understanding of how it does work, read on. Otherwise, by all means skip to the next post.\n \n So, transitional fossils - 'ape-like' in your words. What role do they play in evolutionary theory? In general, they are confirmation of the broad strokes of the theory. More specifically, they can help us flesh out a more detailed understanding of what actually went on in the past.\n \n As to the first, let's say someone proposes a hypothesis of common descent for all living things. Being scientists, we want to test that hypothesis, so we make some predictions of what we ought to be able to observe if the hypothesis accurately reflects reality. Straight away based on what we can observe of hereditary processes we would predict that if humans and other apes did share a common ancestor, it would have a blend of human, ape-like and physically intermediate features, so we should be able to find fossils with those characteristics. And as it turns out, we can.\n \n So we have a piece of confirmatory evidence. And as we find more fossils that are transitional between human and ape - and as importantly no fossils that are transitional between human and anything else - we can start to ask: how plausible is any explanation other than common descent for these fossil finds?\n \n But we're not done yet. We can factor in the dating of these fossil finds - the age of the strata in which they're found, which is usually confirmed via multiple independent dating methods, and see that the older the fossil, the less human-like and more ape-like they appear. Does this prove common descent? No, but it fits perfectly with the hypothesis and again we have to ask ourselves: what other plausible explanation is there?\n \n But we're still not done yet. We can look at our genes, and see just how much we have in common with other apes. On its own, is this proof? No: there are other plausible explanations for shared functional genes, eg re-use of a design by a designer. But again, it fits the hypothesis. And when we realise how much broken or non-functional DNA the apes share with each other and with us, our competing 'shared purpose, shared design' hypothesis takes a big hit.\n \n And we're still not done. Although many of the errors in our genes are the same as those in the genes of other apes (far too many for it to be a coincidence), each species has some extra errors unique to it. And when we measure the rate at which such errors appear to occur, we discover that there's been just enough time since the transitional fossils we found were alive for that many extra errors to accumulate. \n \n It's the consillience of evidence that I find convincing, AA. It's the lack of any other remotely plausible explanation for millions of observable facts. That's why Piltdown Man is a cheerleader for my team, not yours: your competing hypothesis for the sheer groaning weight of evidence for evolution is that it is a tissue of lies and false assumptions knowingly and deliberately perpetuated for no adequately explained reason by a worldwide and yet completely undetectable silent conspiracy. Yet you point to Piltdown Man - a failed subterfuge exposed by the scientific community despite it appearing to confirm their preconceptions - as evidence that such a thing is possible!\n \n Your version of events doesn't make sense, AA. Even if we hypothesise that all hominid fossil finds are fraudulent, what are the odds that those finds would have been faked in strata that just happened to yield consillience with DNA mutation rate evidence whose existence would only be discovered half a century later?",

But first, you need to know why it is so important to evolutionists to prove that Neanderthal4 man is a separate species, and not our ancestor.\n \n The first Neanderthal skeleton was discovered in 1856, just three years before the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species. The nineteenth century evolutionists believed that apes evolved into some sub-human missing links, which evolved into man. Naturally, Neanderthal man was immediately assumed to be one of those missing links and was depicted as at the right.\n \n The more scientists learned about Neanderthal man, the more they realized he did not fit in with their theory very well. Apes supposedly got smarter as their brains gradually evolved in size from about 400 cc to modern man's 1350 cc brain.5 It was difficult to explain how a Neanderthal man, with his 1740 cc brain6, fit into this process.\n \n The Neanderthal skeletons were found in graves with hands neatly folded, surrounded by fossilized pollen. This is a pretty clear indication that they were buried with flowers in some sort of funeral ceremony. Only humans do that. Furthermore, they found tools (and possibly a musical instrument7) associated with some of the Neanderthal remains. Every indication was that he was as fully human as Homo sapiens (modern man).\n \n But worst of all was the time problem. According to the evolutionists' dating, Homo sapiens supposedly evolved 100,000 years ago.8 Some people even claim there is evidence of Homo sapiens in Australia 116,000 to 176,000 years ago.9 Neanderthal man supposedly lived from 36,000 to 75,000 years ago,10 or maybe as long as 82,000 years ago.11 Homo sapiens could not have evolved from Neanderthals if Homo sapiens were here first. Even if you assume that Neanderthals existed more than 176,000 years ago, but their fossils just haven't been discovered yet, that's still a problem because the theory requires the inferior species to die out for the superior species to evolve.\n \n Here's why death is necessary for evolution: Suppose that you, through some extremely fortunate (we have to carefully avoid the adjective \"miraculous\" ) chance, acquire a new, beneficial gene by random mutation. Since you produce children through a sexual process in which your children inherit half of your genes and half of your spouse's genes, the odds are that only half of your children will acquire the marvelous new gene. One quarter of your grandchildren will acquire it; one eighth of your great-grandchildren will acquire it; and so on. Your marvelous new gene will not become a dominant characteristic in future generations.\n \n But suppose that it is a cruel world, and many children don't survive. The half of your children who have the marvelous new gene will win the battle for survival. Your children without the new gene, and all your neighbor's children, will die before they mature enough to have children. Your sons and daughters will have no choice but to marry their sisters and brothers who have the new gene, so the new characteristic provided by this new gene will become established in the population.\n \n We may have over-simplified the process a little bit too much, but that's the theory of evolution in a nut shell (a particularly appropriate metaphor, in this case). Evolution depends upon death to weed out the genes of the inferior race so that the superior race can become established.\n \n Neanderthal man and modern man could not live together for tens of thousands of years, interbreeding with each other, without the races blending. Therefore, the evolutionists have to believe that Neanderthal man and modern man were distinct species, incapable of interbreeding.\n \n Evolutionists have held this belief for several years, even before the questionable DNA study. For example, it has been argued that nasal features indicate that modern man and Neanderthal man were separate species.\n \n \"It is mind-boggling how different Neandertal nasal structures are from those of humans\", [Jeffery H.] Schwartz [of the University of Pittsburgh] holds. 12\n From his choice of words it is clear that Schwartz didn't consider Neanderthals to be human.\n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu.gMnaBH7pIAW11XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExbTV0dDR1BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=129gioci6/EXP=1201794700/**http%3a//www.ridgecrest.ca.us/~do_while/sage/v1i12f.htm\n \n And isn't it interesting that our less advanced ancestor had a larger brain than we do. And similar but unique problems exist with every other type of alleged descendant of Modern Man. All of which you ignore of course.\n",

This shallow science takes ancient fossils that are mere pieces of the original animal and from those pieces, they extrapolate that they were connected to the human lineage as descendants of ours. All of these ASSUMPTIONS based on nothing more than these animals being primates/hominids.\n \n Some were pure tree dwellers who never or rarely walked on the ground; others were 3 feet tall with hands that scraped the ground when the hobbled around with necks that had no resemblance at all to how the human head sets on our shoulders.

So let's assume that these dating methods are right on the money, prove to me that these more primitive, less human primates/hominids which appear to be more ape like ARE NOT IN FACT PRIMITIVE APES THAT ARE LONG EXTINCT PRIMATES THAT HAVE NO CONNECTION TO US AT ALL? \n \n Does their mere existence mean that they must be distant relatives of ours? To evolution it does, but not to me. Tell me this Peeling, how many ancient fossils have evolution scientists found that upon study were deemed to be just bones of common apes or known primates that had no connection to mans evolutionary journey? Can you produce any of that evidence?\n \n \nBut we're still not done yet. We can look at our genes, and see just how much we have in common with other apes. On its own, is this proof? No: there are other plausible explanations for shared functional genes, eg re-use of a design by a designer. But again, it fits the hypothesis.

Even if we hypothesise that all hominid fossil finds are fraudulent, what are the odds that those finds would have been faked in strata that just happened to yield consillience with DNA mutation rate evidence whose existence would only be discovered half a century later?\n\n \n Regarding the gene evidence, we are truly getting to the meat of this fraud. You rightly point out that, and I quote: But we're still not done yet. We can look at our genes, and see just how much we have in common with other apes. On its own, is this proof? No: AND: Although many of the errors in our genes are the same as those in the genes of other apes (far too many for it to be a coincidence), each species has some extra errors unique to it. And when we measure the rate at which such errors appear to occur, we discover that there's been just enough time since the transitional fossils we found were alive for that many extra errors to accumulate. \n \n And yet here we are today with our actual DNA is shown to be a 98% match the DNA with chimps which we co-exist with in our current incarnation. So by current observation we can plainly see that it only takes a 2% separation of DNA to determine that 2 separate species are just that. Completely different and separate species with nothing more in common than being bipeds/primate types. But we are human beings at the very pinnacle of life on Earth and chimps are lowly animals who still live in trees after all of these millions of years of alleged evolution.

   "Peeling, just because frauds are eventually admitted to 4 decades after being perpetrated and 2 decades after being discovered; I wouldn't be patting the science on the back as evidence of reliability for that. That Time line alone shows that Peking Man was named and categorized originally in 1903 based on the discovery of a single tooth. When i refer to flimsy evidence as being the foundation of your beliefs, that is an understatement.\n \n You act like finding an Ape Like fossil and calling it a Man is actually somehow evidence of anything real at all. Prove those creatures had the creativity and character of what we are today? Prove they had any of the traits of humanity and then prove that evidence wasn't manufactured and simply accepted by evolutionary science because it answered specific necessary questions they needed answered to justify evolutionary theory.\n \n Of course you can't prove any of it, but neither will you question the reliability of such flimsy evidence either. Well, I'm not held to such a limited perspective and firmly believe that if the answers to these questions can't be supplied then it would be foolish to accept such questionable science as right and true.\n\n \n Creationist Claim CC001: Piltdown Man\n \nClaim CC001:\n In 1912, Charles Dawson and Arthur Smith Woodward announced the discovery of a mandible and part of a skull from a gravel pit near Piltdown, England. The mandible was apelike except for humanlike wear on the teeth; the skull was like a modern human. These bones became the basis for Eoanthropus dawsoni, commonly known as Piltdown Man, interpreted as a 500,000-year-old British ape-man. But in the early 1950s, it was found that the jawbone was stained and filed down to give its appearance and that the skull was a recent human fossil. In short, Piltdown Man was a fraud. British scientists believed it because they wanted to. The failure to expose it sooner shows that scientists tend to be guided by their preconceptions. \n Source:\n Gish, Duane T., 1985. Evolution: The Challenge of the Fossil Record. El Cajon, CA: Creation-Life Publishers, pp. 188-190. \n \n Response:\n Piltdown man was exposed by scientists. The fact that it took forty years is certainly no shining example of science in action, but it does show that science corrects errors. \n \n Preconceptions are an unavoidable problem in just about any investigation, but they are less so in science because first, different scientists often have different preconceptions, and second, the physical evidence must always be accounted for. Many scientists from America and Europe did not accept Piltdown Man uncritically, and the hoax unraveled when the fossils could not be reconciled with other hominid fossil finds. \n \n \n One hoax cannot indicate the inferiority of conventional archeology, because creationists have several of their own, including Paluxy footprints, the Calaveras skull, Moab and Malachite Man, and others. More telling is how people deal with these hoaxes. When Piltdown was exposed, it stopped being used as evidence. The creationist hoaxes, however, can still be found cited as if they were real. Piltdown has been over and done with for decades, but the dishonesty of creationist hoaxes continues. \n \n",

According to the evolutionists' dating, Homo sapiens supposedly evolved 100,000 years ago.8 Some people even claim there is evidence of Homo sapiens in Australia 116,000 to 176,000 years ago.9 Neanderthal man supposedly lived from 36,000 to 75,000 years ago,10 or maybe as long as 82,000 years ago.11 Homo sapiens could not have evolved from Neanderthals if Homo sapiens were here first. Even if you assume that Neanderthals existed more than 176,000 years ago, but their fossils just haven't been discovered yet, that's still a problem because the theory requires the inferior species to die out for the superior species to evolve.\n \n\n \n How f-ing ignorant of science are these people?

You effectively just disregarded evidence you couldn't refute and replaced it with information you attribute to my source. That is about as corrupt a debating technique as the Piltdown Man is fraudulent evidence of evolution.\n\n \n Your article is completely full of ####.\n \n \nThe more scientists learned about Neanderthal man, the more they realized he did not fit in with their theory very well. Apes supposedly got smarter as their brains gradually evolved in size from about 400 cc to modern man's 1350 cc brain.5 It was difficult to explain how a Neanderthal man, with his 1740 cc brain6, fit into this process.\n\n \n This is easy to explain if you understand the conditions in which Neanderthal evolved into, essentially cold enviroments. Having more brain space means for space for insulating fat. Larger capacity does not equate to larger brains, that's is a poor assumption which ignores environmental conditions. \n \n \nThe Neanderthal skeletons were found in graves with hands neatly folded, surrounded by fossilized pollen. This is a pretty clear indication that they were buried with flowers in some sort of funeral ceremony. Only humans do that. Furthermore, they found tools (and possibly a musical instrument7) associated with some of the Neanderthal remains. Every indication was that he was as fully human as Homo sapiens (modern man).\n\n \n Aside from being significently anatomically different in bone structure, general mass and genetic make up. What kind of idiot argues that an specimen who behaves similarly is the same as another when their anatomies are significently different and their genes have large numbers of differences? \n \n Thanks for you showing again that you have a aversion to fact checking. \n \n \nthat's still a problem because the theory requires the inferior species to die out for the superior species to evolve.\n\n \n No it doesn't. Nothing in evolution states that an inferior species must die before a better adapted species can evolve. I challenge you to prove other wise, but you will fail. As you always do.\n \n \nWe may have over-simplified the process a little bit too much, but that's the theory of evolution in a nut shell (a particularly appropriate metaphor, in this case). Evolution depends upon death to weed out the genes of the inferior race so that the superior race can become established.\n\n \n Uh that bares no resembles to evolution at all. \n \n obviously your article is using the same tricks as other creationist sites. We do have many skeletons that when pieced together produce almost a virtually complete skeleton.\n http://www.livescience.com/history/050310_neanderthal_reconstruction.html\n \n Does it bother you that everything you say is deemed a LIE and UNTRUE until proven otherwise?",

I have said on numerous occasions that it is evo and the misinterpretations of the legitimate sciences that it corrupts that I stand against. For example, I know Geology is effective and useful in locating OIL,Coal, Gold, Silver and all types of mineral deposits. It is a credible and proven scientific endeavor. But as it is applied to evo, and dating rocks and fossils, I believe it is out of its element so to speak, no pun intended. And I say that about the other sciences that apply their skills to evolution also because they are attempting to utilize their valid sciences to prove a nonexistent lie and false belief system is true. \n \n EVOLUTION IS BOGUS SCIENCE, AND YOU WILL NEVER THREATEN OR INTIMIDATE ME INTO BELIEVING OTHERWISE.

An good argument can stand up to any number of opponents if they let them argue. A poor argument cannot stand up to one. Numbers here are irrelevant, what matters is whether or not one has an good argument and AA tends not to. So do you. TRIGGER's point is obvious, it is not about the numbers, it is about how the audience perceives you.

Get over it. You had an bad argument. Live and learn. I generally don't discuss topics I don't understand. I take the time to research and inform myself, regularly checking my facts before making a post. That is the mature thing to do. When I screw up, I make it a point to not screw up as much as I can. Mitigation is the key here. \n \n You can tell who has an bad argument and who has a good argument independent of how many people are detracting from it. Furthermore, just because you are outnumbered does not make your argument good or valid. Numbers are irrelevant as we are not preventing AA from making his point. In many cases we are asking him directly to clarify and defend his positions. The only time your argument is valid would be if we were shouting him down and preventing him from speaking. That is simply not the case here. His refusal to provide an decent argument is the problem here. Not us. \n \n \nAnd a good tactic for losing is showing the audience that you're a member of a 14 person gang, against only one opposing poster.\n\n \n True, under the condition that the gang has a bad argument and the single opposed has a good argument. That is not the case here. Unfortunately for AA, his arguments are poor. And that tactic usually works where the audience is incapable of reviewing the arguments due to time constraints. That does not exist here where an audience member can easily view all of the claims made by everyone. An easy way of proving that such a tactic is in play would be to examine the validity of the sole opposing arguments.

What we are asking for is for him to address points we are making, which are not the same. You'll notice that many of the questions asked to him have wide ranges in scope and subject. You are arguing that the condition of being outnumbered makes us wrong and him right without examining the actual arguments. That is an bad argument itself. Pure numbers mean nothing, especially here. What matters is the validity, factual basis and truth of one's argument. If you removed all of us except for AA, his arguments would still be flawed and still be bad.

You've derided Shadow Pikachu as not a true Christian for disagreeing with your narrow views. Furthermore, how many of us have stated that we are atheists? One, maybe two? I'm not an atheist. Just because someone disagrees with you does not make them an atheist. And you are ignoring that spirituality is different from religion. See you just proved my point. You called me spiritual dead when I am not an atheist. My signature has stated that not everyone who disagrees with you is an atheist and you just called me an implicit atheist. Evolution is not an God. God created the big bang and set in motion everything and then took off to who knows where. I'm sure you can figure out which God I'm talking about. \n \n \nNot at all little boy, I form my arguments just fine.\n\n \n I beg to disagree. You don't fact check. The recent article you posted has ignored the facts that we do have virtually complete skeletons of Neanderthals and that the idea that we evolved from Neanderthals is completely false and has been rebuked long ago. Heck, Discovery Channel had an show on it in 1997. That's more then 10 years ago. You don't fact check and your arguments show it. If you did form your arguments well, you would have fact checked, figured out that bumble bees use dynamic stalling, the freaky links prop was an prop and that Neanderthals were not part of the homo sapien line.

Remember my old thread about the scientific validity of the flood? You didn't try to argue against it. If that was horse dung too, you would have easily defeated it. Instead it took 20 pages before an single creationist tried. \n \n Claiming we have poor arguments and utterly failing to even address any of their points is a contradiction. If they were indeed poor arguments you could easily defeat them. But you don't. You run.\n \n \nTalk about philosophical cowardice. And for Gods sake, if you are so intelligent would you please learn the difference between \"a\" and \"an\" in a sentence?\n\n \n Grammar attacks are weak. Very, very, very weak.

We're not. \n \n \nAs in many debates here, the arguments are dependent on worldviews. The audience can see that.\n\n \n That's not even relevant. A bad argument that relies on incorrect data as well as circular reasoning, not to mention BAD reasoning is independent of world views. For instance, AA argued that if one mistake in science exists, it's all wrong. I countered with the statistical analysis in that using a wrong Z score can result in minor or big changes.

My argument on examination applies everywhere. \n \n \nI agree - attempts to destroy any time constraints he may have.\n\n \n He's obviously checking in many times during the day.

   "Hi Dane, welcome to 4forums. Peer Review regarding evolutionary science is nothing more that a group of fellow charlatans rubber stamping what another charlatan submitted for approval to further the scam and lie of evolutionary science for the unwashed masses whom they seek to con into accepting this false science. \nEh... no it isn't. The peer review is the foundation for ALL science, all peer-reviewed under the same standards. The peer-review for biology is exactly the same as the peer-review for physics and chemistry etc. Why the misrepresentation. If you are unable to post without being so dishonest, why should anybody ever waste time with you? Could you please reign in your bearing of false witness and start a serious and honest discussion of these matters please.\n \nI submit the 40 year support the Piltdown Man enjoyed as evidence of such collusion within the scientific community because Piltdown Man supported the preconceived notions of evolutionary science at large.\nThe piltdown man was \"discovered in 1912. But where is your scientific evidence, where is the peer-reviewed science? Where is your scientific evidence? Because already in 1925, Wilson pointed out that the gravel where it was claimed to have been found was much younger than the finders had claimed. So science never did the embrace of the piltdown man as you claim. Rather, the press ran with the story and science steadily disproved it.\n \n So where is the collusion you claim? Why do you need to lie?\n \nFrom the same link, here is a rundown of the original evidence upon which the theory of evolution rests. It is very telling how LITTLE original evidence was available for such an all encompassing current discipline of the study to exist today.\nAh, you mean as since then the hypothesis has been tested and found valid by hudreds of thousands of studies not present originally? Like that?\n \nSo as you can see Dane, the agreement by the complete evolutionary scientific community that a discovery is real means very little in reality that it is actually true or that in 50 years it wont be shown to be a complete fraud.\nWhat \"complete evolutionary scientific community\" are you talking about? Please provide documentation for that obviously false claim. If you can not stop that deceit and misrepresentation, then there is no reason for anybody to engage with you. \n \n If all you are able to serve up is sophistry and emotional hyperbole, then go play with the other 10-year-olds who use that method of \"debate.\" Else grow up.",

   "What you're admitting here is that until enough evidence came forward that completely and obviously refuted the Piltdown Man, then the community was happy not to expose what they knew to be a fraud for more than 2 decades.\n\n No, you're doing it again: saying that the scientific community knew it to be a fraud before the evidence was there to prove it. Surely you can see the illogicality of that statement.\n \nIf Piltdown Man was the only misrepresentation ever revealed then that would be one thing, but I posted others above. All of which will be ignored.\n\n I'm not ignoring them, AA, and neither did the scientific community: that's why these frauds did not pass muster. As dating techniques became more refined, and the 'celebrity archaologist' fad faded, the motivation and opportunity for fraudulent research in that area has been curtailed.\n \n \nAnd this is where the fraud and delusions begin Peeling. This shallow science takes ancient fossils that are mere pieces of the original animal and from those pieces, they extrapolate that they were connected to the human lineage as descendants of ours. All of these ASSUMPTIONS based on nothing more than these animals being primates/hominids.\n\n \n That's actually wrong in a couple of important respects, but we're getting ahead of ourselves. Before we worry about what detailed conclusions are drawn from these bones, would you agree that finding fossils with intermediate ape/hominid features (for your peace of mind I'll avoid what you consider to be the loaded term 'transitional'), and finding them only in strata older than any in which we find modern human or ape remains, is at the very least perfectly congruent with a hypothesis of common descent?\n \nTRANSITIONAL: The magic word that convinces you that you have something real. But you don't, because none of the evidence you have actually proves that these fossils are transitional at all.\n\n I'm perfectly happy to use a different term if you prefer, but there are a number of reasons why 'transitional' is the one in common usage, and why it isn't as loaded a term as you think.\n \n The hypothesis of common descent predicts 'transitional fossils': remains containing a mixture of features, only found in strata older than those in which remains of the species we think might be related are found. That's a pretty specific prediction. So when we find such remains, and keep finding them and keep finding them, in the precise strata we predict we should find them if they were genuine transitional fossils (as opposed to hybrids), the justification builds for referring to them as 'transitional' rather than 'remains containing a mixture of features, only found in strata older than those in which remains of the species we think might be related are found.'\n \n Bear in mind that 'transitional' does not mean ancestral. If you think it is intended to mean ancestral, you're wrong. Ok? I'm not joking, or being evasive, or trying to bamboozle you. No scientist would ever claim to know that a particular fossil is an ancestor of a modern species. For simplicity's sake, popular media tends to refer to fossil hominids as 'man's ancestors', and most of the time it suffices to convey the right general impression. A fossil might be directly ancestral, but it's much more likely to be a close relative of an ancestor, like your great-grandfather's brother rather than your great-grandfather himself.\n \n This is why your approach to debunking evolution is fundamentally flawed: you keep saying how there's no proof that this or that fossil is an ancestor of humans and apes and thus the theory of evolution has no foundation. But the theory of evolution is not founded on the assumption that any given fossil is an ancestor of modern species. You're kicking away props that aren't there.\n \n \nI would love to hammer you on the unreliability of your multiple independent dating methods\n\n And I would love to watch you repeatedly smack your thumb, so let's do it sometime :)\n \nSo let's assume that these dating methods are right on the money, prove to me that these more primitive, less human primates/hominids which appear to be more ape like ARE NOT IN FACT PRIMITIVE APES THAT ARE LONG EXTINCT PRIMATES THAT HAVE NO CONNECTION TO US AT ALL?\n\n It's not a question of proof, AA, it's really not. The question is, what is the most plausible explanation for the evidence we have found?\n \n Forget evolution for a moment and consider what you're asking me to believe. Since you reject evolution completely, I presume you also reject the idea that any of these physiologically different 'transitional' fossils were related. So you're asking for me to believe that ten or more species intermediate in appearance between ape and man all lived in parallel, all went extinct, and all just happened to leave fossil remains in chronologically more recent strata according to how much they looked like humans, purely by coincidence. Moreover, you're asking me to believe that for no reason whatsoever, no species left fossils that were intermediate in appearance between humans and anything else.\n \n But it's not just humans and apes. You're asking me to believe that all other 'transitional' fossils are the same kind of coincidence: a seperate, unrelated species that just happened to go extinct and just happened to leave fossils in just the right strata, while the species they 'appear' to be transitional examples of - who according to you lived side by side with them - managed to avoid leaving fossils until after the intermediate species was extinct. Does that sound plausible to you?\n \n But it gets even better. Atop this already insupportable mountain of coincidence you also ask me to believe that all these false chains of intermediate fossils and extinctions just happen to occur in a chronologically ordered branching tree pattern, purely by chance, even though 'in reality' all species lived together, right from the start.\n \n I'm sorry, AA, but that's ridiculous.\n \nAnd yet here we are today with our actual DNA is shown to be a 98% match the DNA with chimps which we co-exist with in our current incarnation. So by current observation we can plainly see that it only takes a 2% separation of DNA to determine that 2 separate species are just that. Completely different and separate species with nothing more in common than being bipeds/primate types. But we are human beings at the very pinnacle of life on Earth and chimps are lowly animals who still live in trees after all of these millions of years of alleged evolution. Go figure huh?\n\n I note you've chosen to ignore the problem that shared, broken DNA poses for your 'seperate creation' hypothesis. Never mind. \n \n The notion that human beings are 'the very pinnacle' is debateable. If you choose as your criteria the things we happen to be best at, sure, we'll be at the apex of that graph - but then almost any species would be at the top of some graph or other :) I'm being tongue-in-cheek, but there's a serious point to be made here. \n \n Consider your rhetorical question: \"if evolution is true, why have we evolved while they are still living in trees?\". It's a silly question because it presumes that evolution states there were at some point chimps living in trees and humans living in trees. Wrong. Chimps and humans are two branches from an ancestral species (which might or might not have been tree-dwelling). Both species have evolved since that time, to suit different niches (niches which of course are themselves evolving over time). Why didn't all the ancestral species evolve into humans? Because the niche chimps now occupy is a perfectly valid one and naturally seperated their ancestors (in terms of interbreeding) from the ancestors who ended up as us. No creature back then could know that the path our ancestors followed would drive the development of our language, social and technological skills to such a degree.\n \n If that doesn't really grab you, try this: who's going to live longer dropped into the middle of a jungle naked, you or a chimp? When you have the answer, you'll understand why the ape-ancestors who stayed in that environment didn't evolve in the same way as those that left it.",

   "Eh... no it isn't. The peer review is the foundation for ALL science, all peer-reviewed under the same standards. The peer-review for biology is exactly the same as the peer-review for physics and chemistry etc. Why the misrepresentation. If you are unable to post without being so dishonest, why should anybody ever waste time with you? Could you please reign in your bearing of false witness and start a serious and honest discussion of these matters please.\n\n \n Dane, I responded to you with respect and complete sincerity so please don't question my honesty just because you don't agree with my perspective. You obviously attribute great weight to the peer review process in evolutionary science, where as I don't. I firmly believe that evo is based on proving a preconceived notion which immediately nullifies it as a legitimate scientific endeavor. And if all of the people reviewing a submission are proponents of evolutionary science, then they go into the process with a preconceived belief in what they are reviewing.\n \n Rather than determining if it is inherently true, they may very well be asking themselves what new discovery are they the first to see. If these so called evolutionary discoveries were peer reviewed by, let's say creation scientists, and accepted by them, then that would be convincing evidence that this alleged discovery is valid. But getting it rubber stamped by a bunch or pro evo believers is like when a corrupt police department investigates itself for corruption. Are we really surprised when they got a clean bill of health and found no evidence of corruption?\n \n And regarding Peer Review being the foundation of science, did Henry Ford submit the science for the Model A for peer review before starting to build the car? Did Gates have his software reviewed before starting Microsoft? Did Steve Jobs have the Apple Computer peer reviewed before building and selling the Apple Computer? I think not. Real science needs no peer review because it WORKS. Only theoretical science needs peer review to affirm that it support the theory it is based upon. And that is a totally subjective basis upon which to build or support a theoretical science. In other words it isn't based on any firm foundation of facts at all.\n \n \nThe piltdown man was \"discovered in 1912. But where is your scientific evidence, where is the peer-reviewed science? Where is your scientific evidence? Because already in 1925, Wilson pointed out that the gravel where it was claimed to have been found was much younger than the finders had claimed. So science never did the embrace of the piltdown man as you claim. Rather, the press ran with the story and science steadily disproved it.\n \n So where is the collusion you claim? Why do you need to lie?\n Ah, you mean as since then the hypothesis has been tested and found valid by hudreds of thousands of studies not present originally? Like that?\n What \"complete evolutionary scientific community\" are you talking about? Please provide documentation for that obviously false claim. If you can not stop that deceit and misrepresentation, then there is no reason for anybody to engage with you. \n\n \n Why in your response to me did you completely erase the link I posted as evidence while asking where my scientific evidence is? You don't consider your tactics here to be lying? The link I posted is very extensive regarding all aspects of the Piltdown Mans acceptance by the scientific community, and the evidence that even though CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS questioned its viability and showed it to be a hoax by 1925, the Evo community as a whole ignored those individuals and even demonized them in favor of what they wanted to believe for a full 25 years more. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=299209&postcount=72\n \n \nIf all you are able to serve up is sophistry and emotional hyperbole, then go play with the other 10-year-olds who use that method of \"debate.\" Else grow up.\n\n \n I submit that sophistry and emotional hyperbole is all that you have offered here Dane, because nothing you offered here is based in hard facts but is more garbage derived completely from your belief and faith in a false science that will never ever be proven to be true because none of the conclusions it arrives at are based on anything firm, real or absolute.",

It wasn't generally accepted by the paleontologists of day, only by some, especially English paleontologists involved in the original \"discovery\". It remained questionable elsewhere. It was so questionable, that there were constant requests to view the \"fossils\". \n \n So you are spinning a myth here. Some paleontologists wanted to believe Piltdown was real, others had major doubts, and those doubts eventually led to the uncovery of the hoax.\n \n So when you tell lies about the entire scientific community accepting Piltdown as real, all you succeed in doing is revealing your ignorance of history.\n \n And what you conveniently ignore is that eventually, Piltdown was refuted by science, not by Creationist claptrap.

Ignore me? That definitely won't help you. \n \n The facts are, you stated a promise to reduce the problems in the forum. I then gave you a list of behaviors YOU could stop YOURSELF that were contributing to the problems. You refused to do this. Therefore it seems your promise was empty and perhaps even an outright lie. \n \n \nBecause you know you don't want peace with me. You just want to fight.\n\n \n No, I want you to make a decent argument that has been fact checked and uses logic. I disagree with others here all of the time, religious and non-religious. The only people I have problems with are those who refuse to provide decent arguments that rely on logic and actual facts. Hence you and an few others. I disagree with jyhouse (sp?) a fair amount of the time and you don't see this conflict between us. Because that user puts thought, effort, logic and reason as well as facts into their posts. You do not. \n \n I actually don't care what you believe. I care about how good or how bad your arguments are.\n \n And your arguments are some of the worst I've seen in over five boards. \n \n \nThat is why it's a waste of time communicating with you.\n\n \n No, you think it's an waste because you don't like losing. You claim that against everyone who disagrees with you and who also has a history of busting your chops. \n \n \nTo imply that it's fear on my part, or running away just shows how utterly childish and immature you are. Pathetic really.\n\n \n Because....\n \n \nThat's why it's easier to state my case and then ignore your harping and whining. If what I post isn't good enough for you, and you think that accusing me of running when I refuse to repeat myself, then tough again. You're a childish punk and I don't respond well to punks who threaten me.\n\n \n Obviously. Your arguments have gone from bad to worse in the recent days. And you are the one whining, complaining about being the victim here. I'm not asking you to repeat yourself. I'm asking you to address my points. You have outright refused to do so.\n \n \nAnd this quote of yours is precious because it shows perfectly how dishonest, corrupt and pathetic you really are. You see you are a liar who must slander the opposition that you can't stand up to honestly.\n\n \n Honesty? Are you SERIOUS?\n \n Show me where I lied. Show me where ANYONE except YOU have lied.\n \n I'm not the one who posted the freaky links tv prop as evidence. I'm not the one who claimed bees can't fly. I'm not the one who posted numerous articles that fly in the face of peer reviewed practical science. I'm not the one who relied on hoaxes, frauds and lies for my arguments.\n \n You did. \n \n I now see that your definition of honesty is clearly deviant from that of society's. \n \n If one lies, uses frauds and hoaxes, pretends refutations don't exist and fabricates what others say they are honest.\n \n \nI have said on numerous occasions that it is evo and the misinterpretations of the legitimate sciences that it corrupts that I stand against. For example, I know Geology is effective and useful in locating OIL,Coal, Gold, Silver and all types of mineral deposits.\n\n \n But in your ignorance you fail to realize the sciences are no different for evolution.\n \n \nIt is a credible and proven scientific endeavor. But as it is applied to evo, and dating rocks and fossils, I believe it is out of its element so to speak, no pun intended. And I say that about the other sciences that apply their skills to evolution also because they are attempting to utilize their valid sciences to prove a nonexistent lie and false belief system is true.\n\n \n Except you can't prove this. And you ignore the fact that gas and oil deposits are found in areas that previously had specific types of foliage and bacteria, which are dated by geology. Evolution has an time line of the planet, associated with specific flora and fauna and land masses. The same geology that proves that is the same geology which finds the areas where these deposits arose. It's no coincidence that the dating of flora that became fossil fuels is the same as the dating used by big oil to find these fuels. \n \n You have NEVER dealt with this problem.\n \n CHRISTIANITY IS BOGUS BELIEF, AND YOU WILL NEVER THREATEN OR INTIMIDATE ME INTO BELIEVING OTHERWISE. BECAUSE FOOL, I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THE LIES YOU SO RABIDLY CLING TO.\n \n Wow. That was easy.\n \n \nSo like the slanderous liar and deceptive poser that you are, you will take my refusal to accept your religion of evolution and from that extrapolate a lie, and accuse me of rejecting every aspect of every science that plays a part in supporting the fraud of evolution, thereby implying that I'm some anti-science neanderthal.\n\n \n calling it an fraud does not make it an fraud. I realize you are allergic to the concept of proof, but you are the one claiming evolution is an fraud, therefore the burden is on you. I have claimed that the flood never happened and gave an myraid of reasons why it could not have happened. I met the burden of proof where you are relying ENTIRELY on \"I said so\" arguments. \n \n \nIt is just those types of lies and deceitful slanderous misrepresentations that makes you a truly dishonest poster who is a waste of time trying to reason with and a cancer to this forum.\n\n \n You're funny. \n \n Prove I'm lying or you are lying.",

But we both know that the technical belief system of the Theory of Evolution clearly states that all life on Earth EVOLVED APART FROM ANY SUPERNATURAL/INTELLIGENT CREATIVE FORCE. It all came about by Random Mutation and Natural Selection according to Evolution. That belief system doesn't leave a lot of room for a personal God creating all life on Earth, and then Man in His own image. \n \n So for you to now claim that the ToE and God being blend-able is not a mutually exclusive term is disingenuous in light of what the ToE claims at every level of its rationale. \n \n \n invite you to answer this question: is it possible for god to exist and the ToE to be an accurate model of the evolution of life from its earliest forms to what we see around us?\n\n \n To answer your question directly Peeling, based on how the ToE is framed and promoted as a Natural selection way for life to have evolved through Random Mutation, NO, because the thesis upon which it is described to exist leaves no real way for a Creator God to have played any part in the process.\n Not as evolution defines itself anyway.\n \n Now, you know as well as I do that cultural christians who don't trust God or the bible as Gods infallible Word will make ridiculous compromises by claiming that God created basic life in the beginning but then abandoned all life to the evolutionary process. And now He is sitting up there somewhere just watching us like some experiment in a petrie dish. Well that whole concept flies in the face of a personal God which the bible clearly defines God as being. God's whole complaint through out the OT is His problem with Israel ignoring Him as their loving Father God and King who is offended when they turned to other Gods instead of Him. \n \n What you must grasp in dealing with the living God is that He doesn't compromise His principles at all. So He will never accept this blended belief of creationist evolution that pseudo christians promote. It implies that in species that exist today, originally existed as other species that evolved into current species and I totally reject the concept of inter-species evolution. That belief that from the original single celled life forms that originally grew from the primordial ooze is where intelligent life and all species evolved from is the true stumbling block for true Creationists like me. The whole process just completely erases the Creator God from the process of our existence.\n \n ==========================================================================================\n \n Now would you like me to explain how I can answer the questions raised by all of the fossil evidence we find in the animal kingdom? It is called Rapid Adaptation. It explains how animals have a symbiotic relationship with the Earth and each species will adjust within very few generations in order to ADAPT to the environmental pressures placed upon them by changing climates and even Natural disasters that effect their habitats and ecosystems. Here is a page of links to investigate what is out there about the science of Rapid Adaptation. Rapid Adaptation asserts that life will always survive and animals will adjust to the social pressures the world throws at them through climactic changes and whatnot. Any questions you have after checking out these link I will be happy to discuss further. Rapid Adaptation does not imply that a reptile will evolve into a bird, for example. But a reptile can adapt to environmental pressures that could effect its survival as a species.\n \n I hope you can see though, that I'm not trying to direct or lead the discussion by making the whole search result available to you and not cherry picking specific links to support my claim. \n \n http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=the+science+of+rapid+adaptation&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8",

   "In addition to that page of links Peeling, here is one in particular that explains my understanding and stance perfectly. This perspective is rational, reasonable and consistent with all available information we have without having to make huge illogical leaps while trying to make pieces fit that just don't fit at all. And feel free to check out the sources and references from which these facts are derived.\n Rapid Adaptation of Finches not Evidence For Evolution\n by Patrick Young, Ph.D.\n \n The January 11th, 2002 issue of Science magazine reports on research confirming rapid adaptation of house finches in Montana and Alabama1,2 . The documents' recount, (1) male and female finches grow differently both within and between populations, (2) males grow faster than females and have wider bills and longer tails in Alabama, and (3) females grow faster and are bigger overall in Montana3 . Both writings are proclaiming these finch adaptations are evidence for evolution.\n \n It appears the definitions used for evolution have undergone more mutations than the theory as a whole. Even the Columbus Dispatch and our proposed new Ohio Science Standards report the definition of evolution is \"a change in gene frequency in a population over time\". Evolutionists justify this by asserting a definition can be altered as more information is acquired about the theory. However, the definition is now too general and surreptitiously conceals fundamental flaws in the theory itself. Furthermore, the delineation incorporates observations unrelated to the concepts of Darwinian evolution and effectively results in a classic \"bait and switch\".\n \n A more appropriate definition for evolution is, a continuous naturalistic, mechanistic process by which all living things have arisen from a single living source which itself arose by a similar process from a non-living, inanimate world. This definition requires evolutionists to justify their claims of simplicity to complexity, life from nonlife, and common ancestry.\n \n The other definition seeks to include observed adaptations within species without a corresponding increase in genetic information. For an evolutionist to accomplish this, he must scientifically describe and observe the mechanism by which genetic information is increased via mutation. Since this has never been observed, and there is no viable mechanism, evolution is nothing more than philosophical ramblings. Biophysicist, Dr. Lee Spetner stated, \"The neo-Darwinians would like us to believe that large evolutionary changes can result from a series of small events if there are enough of them. But if these events all lose information they can't be the steps in the kind of evolution the neo-Darwin theory is supposed to explain, no matter how many mutations there are. Whoever thinks macroevolution can be made by mutations that lose information is like the merchant who lost a little money on every sale but thought he could make it up on volume.4\n \n Reporting finch adaptation as evidence for evolution is not unique. Finch evolution gained momentum when the research team of Peter and Rosemary Grant went to the Galapagos Islands in 1973. While observing the wide diversity of finches, they discovered that during an ordinary drought, the average beak length of some birds slightly increased. This preliminary data was then extrapolated to conclude after a certain number of droughts; a new species of finch could be created with a longer beak5. What they did not realize at the time, was during rainy seasons the beaks did not stay the same, they returned to normal. This type of intrinsic oscillation is an eloquent illustration of natural selection via adaptation but not evolution.\n \n The subject papers presented in Science magazine are excellent research examples demonstrating rapid adaptations within a species of bird. However, these adaptations utilize information previously existing in the genetic code of these creatures. The fact remains, they are still finches and they are still birds.\n \n References\n \n Pennisi, E., \"Finches Adapt Rapidly to New Homes\", Science, (2002), 295, pp. 249-250.\n \n Badyaev, A.V., Hill, G.E., Beck, M.L., Dervan, A.A., Duckworth, R.A., McGraw, K.J., Nolan, P.M., Whittingham, L.A., \"Sex-Biased Hatching Order and Adaptive Population Divergence in a Passerine Bird\", Science, (2002), 295, pp. 316-318.\n \n Ref. 1.\n \n Spetner L., \"Not By Chance\", 1998, The Judaica Press, Inc, Brooklyn, NY, p. 160.\n \n Grant, P.R., \"Natural Selection and Darwin's Finches\", Scientific American, (Oct. 1991), 265, pp. 82-87.\n \n Contact Dr. Patrick Young with your comments or questions.\n http://www.creationists.org/patrickyoung/article02.html",

   "TQ, are you completely lacking all semblance of common sense?\n\n No, are you?\n \n \nJust ask yourself if these other sciences claim their existence is based on the assumption that God doesn't exist.\n\n Oh, I see now! Only the ToE states that god does not exist! Wait, no it doesn't...\n \n \nI mean, does the science of Germ Theory say that it ONLY exists because God doesn't? Of course not. \n\n And does the ToE state it ONLY exists because god doesn't? Of course not.\n \n \nIf you and I debated the nuances of germ theory, would God ever come into the discussion?\n\n Probably not. If I and any non-rabid Christian debated the ToE, would god ever come up? Probably not.\n \n \nI think not as germ theory makes no claims about it existing because of or apart from God in any way.\n\n Right, so in that sense Germ Theory and the ToE are identical.\n \n \nBut you know as well as I do that the meat of every debate between evolutionists and Creationists is that evos claim the natural order of our evolution apart from any Creator\n\n No, we \"evolutionists\" state that your belief that the bible is literal is incorrect. Any statements regarding the existence/non-existence of god are statements of belief, and not part of the ToE.\n \n \nand Creationists insist that life on Earth was intelligently designed and created by a Supreme Being.\n\n Which is your belief, but is not based on any evidence.\n \n \nAs is your usual tactic, you can now attempt to change the goal post of this debate\n\n No, I want you to tell me where in the bible it states that the ToE is to be opposed. You yourself admitted it didn't, but your interpretation of the bible opposes your interpretation of the ToE\n \n \nbut if you want to be honest then you know this to be the central difference between the two belief systems.\n\n And if you want to be honest, you would reread my last two posts. Better yet, have an impartial observer read them and explain them to you, as the point seems to be flying right over your head as you decide how you can once again claim to have uncovered my \"dishonesty\".\n \n \nOne claims God created us\n\n That would be your belief system, yes...\n \n \nthe other claims that no God had anything to do with our existence at all.\n\n And that would also be your belief system. In this case, your belief about what the ToE encompasses. As I've stated in two seperate posts now, the ToE does not state this, nor is it implied. It implies this in the same way germ theory implies there is no god.\n \n \nSo why are you attempting to either derail the debate or confuse it by bringing up an off topic tangent that you know has no real bearing in reality or in fact regarding what separates us as evolutionists and creationists? \n\n Apparently you're having trouble following this. Let me put it simply-your interpretation of the bible disagrees with your interpretation of the ToE. In other words, your understanding, and lack of it, are the issue here.\n \n \nWhy is it when you demand such accuracy from me and jump on me as a liar and a hoaxer if I dare post an inaccurate link,\n \n \n Make it a habit, and you'll be called on it.\n \n \nyet you will constantly ask inconsistent, off topic, irrelevant and inaccurate questions that you know make no sense at all in regard to the actual issue being debated, but are in fact nonsensical, if not unanswerable based on the original premise being discussed?\n\n If you would actually read what I've been saying, you will see this is exactly what we were discussing. Unfortunately, you seem unable to follow the breadcrumbs.\n \n \n Is this your HONEST attempt at getting at the real truth, or is it your attempt at taking control of the debate in a very dishonest way? \n\n Another accusation of dishonesty. Getting really tired of that Archie...\n \n \n \nSadly I have learned that If I don't point these distortions out at the time, and just ignore your foolishness then you will automatically claim victory for posting this rubbish and accuse me of running away. So think about changing your level of accuracy and be more consistent in your reasoning and maybe we can stay on track and actually debate honestly in the future.\n\n This is your idea of \"off track\" and \"distortion\"? Your view of reality is even more warped than I thought.\n \n I invite any and all to point out how and where I \"derailed\" this discussion \"dishonestly\"",

   "This link explains it better than I can. Here's an excerpt:\n \n http://www.leaderu.com/issues/fabric/chap05.html\n \n Evolution\n Chapter Five*\n \n The theory of evolution conceived by Charles Darwin and published in 1859 in his book On the Origin of the Species by Means of Natural Selection or, The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, represents the most fundamental challenge to the Christian faith in 2,000 years. Darwin's ideas, which provoked laughter and lampoons in virtually every newspaper of his own day, and a theory for which to this day there is virtually no reliable scientific evidence, have become the cornerstone of modern humanism. Society's faith in the evolutionary hypothesis is the clearest indicator of the gulf that separates secular humanism from the Christian faith and the \"special revelation\" contained in the Bible.\n \n There is virtually no scientific evidence, even in the fossil record, to support Darwin's hypothesis, yet science, education, the intellectual elites, virtually everyone-including some Christians-claim that evolution is the only realistic explanation of creation. Why? The answer may be found in this statement from an article published in the American Atheist magazine:\n \n Christianity is-must be-totally committed to the special creation as described in Genesis, and Christianity must fight with its full might against the theory of evolution. And here is why. In Romans we read that 'sin entered the world through one man, and through sin, death; and thus death has spread through the whole human race because everyone has sinned.' (5:12) . . . the whole justification of Jesus' life and death is predicated on the existence of Adam and the forbidden fruit he and Eve ate. Without the original sin, who needs to be redeemed? Without Adam's fall into a life of constant sin terminated by death, what purpose is there to Christianity? None.\n And so it is. These words of an atheist explain very well the enormous consequences of believing in Darwin's theory. The motivating principle of all Darwinian evolution is to demonstrate how life on earth could be produced by natural or spontaneous generation without the need of God's transcendent power. Evolution denies God. Either the Bible is true and God created the heavens and the earth, or evolution is true and the biblical account is false. You cannot have it both ways.\n \n Dr. L. Harrison Matthews, a noted evolutionist who wrote the introduction to the 1971 edition of Origin of the Species, said,\n \n The fact of evolution is the backbone of biology, and biology is thus in the peculiar position of being a science founded on an unproved theory-is it then a science or faith? Belief in the theory of evolution is thus exactly parallel to belief in special creation-both are concepts which believers know to be true but neither, up to the present, has been capable of proof.\n The Faith of the Unbeliever\n \n The German scientist Max Planck, who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1918, said it even more graphically. In his book, Where Is Science Going?, Planck says:\n \n Anybody who has been seriously engaged in scientific work of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of science are written the words: Ye must have faith. It is a quality which the scientist cannot dispense with.\n The faith of the unbeliever is more rigid and less tolerant of disagreement than the scientists would have us believe. Ernst Mayr, professor at Harvard and one of our country's leading evolutionists, has written: \"Man's worldview today is dominated by the knowledge that the universe, the stars, the earth and all living things have evolved through a long history that was not foreordained or programmed.\" And Ren\u00e9 Dub\u00f3s wrote in American Scientist magazine, \"Most enlightened persons now accept as a fact that everything in the cosmos, from heavenly bodies to human beings, has developed and continues to develop through evolutionary processes.\" Julian Huxley said, \"Evolution is the totality of reality.\"\n \n It is shocking that so few Christians today grasp the significance of this debate, for it is nothing short of a declaration of war on God. The totality of reality is God, not evolution or any other theory; but for true believers in Darwin, evolution has become their God. Charles Darwin wrote in the conclusion to The Origin of the Species, that,\n \n Man with all his noble qualities . . . with his godlike intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system . . . still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.\n What kind of a view of man is this? Is the human species godlike or ape-like? Is man a noble creature with a noble origin and destiny, or a base creature destined to dissolve into a barren and empty eternity of dust? Consider the appraisals of man given by some of the leading proponents of the evolutionary theory.\n \n Schoenberg said that man is merely \"a hairless ape.\" DuMaurier said we are \"a fungus on the surface of one of the minor planets.\" Nietzsche said humanity is \"a rope stretched over an abyss.\" Rudyard Kipling said mankind is \"small potatoes and few.\" W. D. Thornbury claimed human existence is \"a jest, a dream, a show, bubble, air;\" while F. P. Church said that even the most noble individual is \"a mere insect, an ant.\"\n \n This philosophy that denies not only the Word of God and the role of God in human affairs, but the worth of human life, is what boys and girls are being fed from kindergarten through graduate school. As Dr. Paul Blanshard, a leading humanist, evolutionist, and a vigorous critic of religious education, has said:\n \n I think the most important factor leading us to a secular society has been the educational factor. Our schools may not teach Johnny to read properly, but the fact that Johnny is in school until he is 16 tends to lead toward the elimination of religious superstition. The average child now acquires a high school education, and this militates against Adam and Eve and all other myths of alleged history.\n The Great Collapse\n \n Phillip Johnson points out in his book Darwin on Trial that the major pillars upon which evolution has rested are falling down before our eyes. In 1992 it was announced that pictures taken by the infra-red astronomical satellite launched in the mid-eighties, which has been traveling around the earth for several years now, have given us the best view of the universe we have ever had. And now that those pictures have been analyzed, the results are shocking. As one writer put it: \"It would appear that the Big Bang has gone bust.\"\n \n The Big Bang theory claims that something smaller than an atom contained all the matter in the universe and at one point, fifteen billion years or so ago, it exploded and sent everything out into space. If that were so, you would expect to find matter spread evenly in every direction from the source of the explosion. But now that we have the best pictures of the cosmos ever taken, we discover there are not only clusters of galaxies in space, there are structures of galaxies, and there are superstructures of galaxies. Worst of all, right across the middle of the universe there is a great wall of galaxies-billions of them-in the most complex structures, five hundred billion light-years long and twenty billion light-years high and so complex it could not have been formed by a \"big bang.\"\n \n Facts and Fictions\n \n If that isn't enough, scholars at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology provided another shocking bit of news not long ago. Meteorologist Dr. Hyman Hartman said that life did not emerge from amino acids in a primordial slime. Dr. Hartman reports that the crucial reaction was between carbon dioxide and a substance called montmorillonite-in other words, common clay. Shades of Genesis 1 again!\n \n Sir Fred Hoyle, former professor at Cambridge University, discoverer of Steady State cosmogony, and a great mathematician, along with the Indian mathematician Chandra Wickramasinghe, made a fascinating study. They decided to find out what were the probabilities of an entire cell-the simplest living cell-coming into existence anywhere-not merely on the earth, not merely in 4.6 billion years, but in the entire history of the universe. That figure, by the way, keeps changing from year to year and is now estimated to be roughly 15-20 billion years.\n \n What did these men (both atheists) discover? They concluded that the chances of a living cell coming into existence spontaneously anywhere in the cosmos would take 10 to the 40,000th power years. Anything with less probability (which means a higher number) than 10 to the 50th power is never going to happen in the entire universe, we are told by probability experts. \"The chances,\" he said, \"of a tornado blowing through a junkyard, and creating a 747 are vastly greater.\"\n \n \"Where did we come from?\" asked former atheist Sir Fred Hoyle. There is no other universe to appeal to. He concluded that the only explanation for the existence of any life anywhere in this universe is that there must be some sort of gigantic mind which has eternally existed and which, if we wish, we may call God! Science forced him reluctantly to that conclusion, for which he has received an enormous amount of persecution and threats of various kinds.",

Not sure what that has to do with anything...\n \n \nThe faith of the unbeliever is more rigid and less tolerant of disagreement than the scientists would have us believe. Ernst Mayr, professor at Harvard and one of our country's leading evolutionists, has written: \"Man's worldview today is dominated by the knowledge that the universe, the stars, the earth and all living things have evolved through a long history that was not foreordained or programmed.\" And Ren\u00e9 Dub\u00f3s wrote in American Scientist magazine, \"Most enlightened persons now accept as a fact that everything in the cosmos, from heavenly bodies to human beings, has developed and continues to develop through evolutionary processes.\" Julian Huxley said, \"Evolution is the totality of reality.\"\n\n Again, not sure what this has to do with anything. Three famous people offering their opinions.\n \n \nIt is shocking that so few Christians today grasp the significance of this debate, for it is nothing short of a declaration of war on God.\n\n No, it isn't. If you view it as such, it's your problem, no one elses.\n \n \n The totality of reality is God, not evolution or any other theory; but for true believers in Darwin, evolution has become their God.\n\n Untrue, no matter how many times you say it.\n \n \n Charles Darwin wrote in the conclusion to The Origin of the Species, that,\n \n Man with all his noble qualities . . . with his godlike intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system . . . still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.\n\n Actually, that was from \"The Descent of Man\". And once again, the ToE makes no mention of \"lowly\" or progression. This is an outdated concept that was prevalent in Darwin's time.\n \nWhat kind of a view of man is this? Is the human species godlike or ape-like? Is man a noble creature with a noble origin and destiny, or a base creature destined to dissolve into a barren and empty eternity of dust?\n\n Emotional rhetoric with no purpose but to inflame readers.\n \n \nConsider the appraisals of man given by some of the leading proponents of the evolutionary theory.\n \n Schoenberg said that man is merely \"a hairless ape.\"\n\n Which is true.\n \n \nDuMaurier said we are \"a fungus on the surface of one of the minor planets.\" \nCan't say I'd agree with this one. Other than the \"minor planet\" bit. You have to admit, even compared to other planets in just our solar system, Earth is pretty puny.\n \n \nNietzsche said humanity is \"a rope stretched over an abyss.\"\n\n And?\n \n \nRudyard Kipling said mankind is \"small potatoes and few.\"\n\n And?\n \n \nW. D. Thornbury claimed human existence is \"a jest, a dream, a show, bubble, air;\"\n\n And Shakespeare said \"All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players\" \n \n \nwhile F. P. Church said that even the most noble individual is \"a mere insect, an ant.\"\n\n And?\n \n \nThis philosophy that denies not only the Word of God and the role of God in human affairs, but the worth of human life,\n\n Absolute rubbish. The ToE is not a philosophy, and there is absolutely no indication as to why we should give any weight to the above quotes, or why they formed such opinions.\n \n \nis what boys and girls are being fed from kindergarten through graduate school.\n\n Again, absolute garbage.\n \n \nAs Dr. Paul Blanshard, a leading humanist, evolutionist, and a vigorous critic of religious education, has said:\n \n I think the most important factor leading us to a secular society has been the educational factor. Our schools may not teach Johnny to read properly, but the fact that Johnny is in school until he is 16 tends to lead toward the elimination of religious superstition. The average child now acquires a high school education, and this militates against Adam and Eve and all other myths of alleged history.\n\n The only Paul Blanshard I can find was not a doctor, he was a journalist. He was a humanist, yes, but not a scientist, and he was a critic of RC education funded by the government. Again, his opinion has nothing to do with the ToE. Oh, and this quote is also 30 years old. Why is it that all these quotes are at least 3 decades old?\n \n \nThe Great Collapse\n \n Phillip Johnson points out in his book Darwin on Trial that the major pillars upon which evolution has rested are falling down before our eyes.\n\n Oh?\n \n \nIn 1992 it was announced that pictures taken by the infra-red astronomical satellite launched in the mid-eighties, which has been traveling around the earth for several years now, have given us the best view of the universe we have ever had. And now that those pictures have been analyzed, the results are shocking. As one writer put it: \"It would appear that the Big Bang has gone bust.\"\n\n Oh, and which writer was this? Strange how there's no source for this. No source, no credibility. Bye bye.\n \n \nThe Big Bang theory claims that something smaller than an atom contained all the matter in the universe and at one point, fifteen billion years or so ago, it exploded and sent everything out into space.\n\n No, it claims no such thing.\n \n \nIf that were so, you would expect to find matter spread evenly in every direction from the source of the explosion.\n\n Well, yeah, if your strawman was correct, we probably would. Unfortunately, your strawman bears only a passing resemblance to the actual Big Bang theory.\n \n \nBut now that we have the best pictures of the cosmos ever taken, we discover there are not only clusters of galaxies in space, there are structures of galaxies, and there are superstructures of galaxies. Worst of all, right across the middle of the universe there is a great wall of galaxies-billions of them-in the most complex structures, five hundred billion light-years long and twenty billion light-years high and so complex it could not have been formed by a \"big bang.\"\n\n No, it couldn't have been formed from your idea of what the \"Big Bang\" is. I'm not going to teach you cosmology, so again (as was offered in a previous thread), if you have specific objections to the big bang theory, start a new thread with specific objections.\n \n \nIf that isn't enough, scholars at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology provided another shocking bit of news not long ago. Meteorologist Dr. Hyman Hartman said that life did not emerge from amino acids in a primordial slime. Dr. Hartman reports that the crucial reaction was between carbon dioxide and a substance called montmorillonite-in other words, common clay. Shades of Genesis 1 again!\n\n Uh, what does this have to do with anything? All this shows is the creationist tendency to cherry pick science, accepting that which supports their preconceptions and rejecting that which doesn't.\n \n \nSir Fred Hoyle, former professor at Cambridge University, discoverer of Steady State cosmogony, and a great mathematician, along with the Indian mathematician Chandra Wickramasinghe, made a fascinating study.\n\n Is this the one where they said that insects were actually the most intelligent life on earth?\n \n \"The situation points clearly to one of two possibilities. Either we are dealing with an overt plan invented by an intelligence considerably higher than our own, an intelligence which has foreseen all our chemicals and flamethrowers, or the insects have already experienced selection Pressure against intelligences of at least our level in many other environments elsewhere in the universe.\" \n \n \"There is a curious variant of the first possibility. Could the insects themselves be the intelligence much higher than our own? We are so conditioned to thinking that the intelligence of a species can be exemplified by an individual member that it is hard to assess a situation in which each individual might show little intelligence, but in which the combined aggregate of individuals might show much. Yet it is so in our own brains, where no individual neuron can be said to display intelligence but in which the aggregate of neurons constitutes exactly what we understand by intelligence.\" \n \n \"The static nature of insect societies goes against this thinking. If an enormous intelligence inhabits the beehives of the world, we might expect more evidence of its presence. But this may again be to endow an opponent with our own restless characteristics. Perhaps concealment is an essential tactic. Perhaps the intelligence is static because it understands the dictum of sagacious lawyers: 'When your case is going well, say nothing'.\" \n \n \"The insect case is indeed going well. Along with the chemicals and the flamethrowers, there are nuclear bombs also. Insects are highly resistant to X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation. Insects can frequent dumps of radioactive waste without harm. Nor are the plants on which insects feed harmed at all by radioactivity. This sets the scene for the future. From nuclear war only one creature will profit hugely, the insect. Insects may be close to inheriting the Earth without a struggle. It may well seem that man arrived in a brief moment, and then disappeared even more swiftly than he came.\"\n \n\n From Hoyle, Fred & Wickramasinghe, Chandra (1981) Evolution from Space: A theory of cosmic creationism, Chap. 8 (\"Insects from space?\"), pp. 127- 128\n \n \nThey decided to find out what were the probabilities of an entire cell-the simplest living cell-coming into existence anywhere-not merely on the earth, not merely in 4.6 billion years, but in the entire history of the universe. That figure, by the way, keeps changing from year to year and is now estimated to be roughly 15-20 billion years.\n \n What did these men (both atheists) discover? They concluded that the chances of a living cell coming into existence spontaneously anywhere in the cosmos would take 10 to the 40,000th power years. Anything with less probability (which means a higher number) than 10 to the 50th power is never going to happen in the entire universe, we are told by probability experts. \"The chances,\" he said, \"of a tornado blowing through a junkyard, and creating a 747 are vastly greater.\"\n\n Yes, as our knowledge and technology increases, we're able to fine tune our estimate of the age of the universe. That's what science is. As for the probability argument:\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/abioprob.html\n \n \n \n\"Where did we come from?\" asked former atheist Sir Fred Hoyle. There is no other universe to appeal to. He concluded that the only explanation for the existence of any life anywhere in this universe is that there must be some sort of gigantic mind which has eternally existed and which, if we wish, we may call God! Science forced him reluctantly to that conclusion, for which he has received an enormous amount of persecution and threats of various kinds.\n\n Actually, he believed in panspermia (aliens created us).\n \n Well, your cut and paste job took you 2 minutes. This reply has taken me roughly 2 hours. Now you see why we get frustrated when you spout off 10 questions at once and run away when we respond and ask you to provide support for your claims.",

   "TQ, are you completely lacking all semblance of common sense? Just ask yourself if these other sciences claim their existence is based on the assumption that God doesn't exist.\n\n \n They don't, but neither does evolution. Evolution merely explains how things happened, exactly in the same form and fashion as how chemistry explains reactions, physics explains force, speed, etc, and how geology explains how sediments form. None of them discuss God because Science is the study of the natural world where God is clearly within the realm of the supernatural. None of them even discuss God at all and that includes arguments against God(s) existence. Your arguments never address this.\n \n \nI mean, does the science of Germ Theory say that it ONLY exists because God doesn't? Of course not.\n\n \n And neither does evolution. Evolution, like Germ Theory does not discuss period. There is absolutely no mention of any supernatural causes in any of its arguments. None. Whatsoever. You will never find any in any respectable source despite what you wish to believe.\n \n \nIf you and I debated the nuances of germ theory, would God ever come into the discussion? I think not as germ theory makes no claims about it existing because of or apart from God in any way.\n\n \n And neither does evolution. \n \n \nBut you know as well as I do that the meat of every debate between evolutionists and Creationists is that evos claim the natural order of our evolution apart from any Creator and Creationists insist that life on Earth was intelligently designed and created by a Supreme Being.\n\n \n Not at all. Again, you are tying your arguments to what Christanity actually means while failing to prove that your interpretation of Christanity is in fact true. That's extremely dishonest. If we took ShadowPikachu's interpretation, which you cannot prove to be wrong any more then you can prove your interpretation to correct, then there is no problem with Christanity and Evolution. In fact many theistic creationists believe that evolution was an part of God's plan. And many other religions, which in fact DO exist despite your previous comments also believe in theistic evolution. The only three major groups that reject that idea are ultra orthodox Judaism, Conservative Islam and Conservative Evangelical Christanity. Buddhism is one of the major world religions that openly accepts evolution as part of the spiritual world. Deism while smaller then Buddhism has absolutely no problems and sees that evolution is in fact merely an product of the act of origin creation. Creationists come in various forms and beliefs. Old Earth Creationists have no problem with evolution either. \n \n \nAs is your usual tactic, you can now attempt to change the goal post of this debate but if you want to be honest then you know this to be the central difference between the two belief systems.\n\n \n Two of many belief systems. Try to understand that there are more religious beliefs then yours out there. \n \n \nOne claims God created us, the other claims that no God had anything to do with our existence at all.\n\n \n See above for why that argument is not only fallacious but just ignorant.\n \n \nSo why are you attempting to either derail the debate or confuse it by bringing up an off topic tangent that you know has no real bearing in reality or in fact regarding what separates us as evolutionists and creationists? \n\n \n It is hardly irrelevant. You have claimed that evolution is anti-God because it states (falsely that is) that God was no part of it. The thing is every science does not discuss God period, including evolution. Therefore, since you hold evolution which mentions God not once, that all sciences are anti-God. You will not find God anywhere in the modern theory. Not an argument for it, not an argument against it. Evolution, like Germ Theory, merely looks at the evidence of the natural world and makes conclusions. As God is obviously not leaving evidence (hence the word FAITH), it is natural for God not to be in any such discussion.\n \n \nWhy is it dishonest way?\n\n \n Only you see that as dishonest. The rest of us are using the dictionary, scientific theory of evolution. You are using an strawman. \n \n \nSadly I have learned that If I don't point these distortions out at the time, and just ignore your foolishness then you will automatically claim victory for posting this rubbish and accuse me of running away. So think about changing your level of accuracy and be more consistent in your reasoning and maybe we can stay on track and actually debate honestly in the future.\n\n \n Honestly? Perhaps you should drop the strawman if you wish to discuss honesty.",

A disproof is rarely accepted as a disproof (lunar dust, Paluxy footprints, anyone?), and the original hypothesis is clung to as if it were a self-evident axiom, not a thesis that has been tried and found inadequate.\n \n Under the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that scientists in their frustration accuse Creationists of dishonesty -- and there have been numerous examples of deliberate deceit and lying, as well as more innocent but still culpable ignorance. When a student persists in claiming that 2+2=5 even after a teacher has demonstrated the equation is false, one can only shake one's head sadly and move on. It becomes an example of invincible ignorance, and the student an object of pity at best, and derision at worst.",

   "Uh, john, are you committing plagiarism here? You erased my complete article out and placed this quote in as if my source said it. But it doesn't say it anywhere.\n\n Really? Look again at your #79.\n \nAnd speaking of Neanderthal Man:\n \n The Neanderthal Problem\n \n There were reports in the general news media that \"you're not a Neanderthal after all\"1 because \"we didn't mate with Neanderthals\".2 We will discuss the study3 that prompted these reports later, and let you decide whether the DNA study results are conclusive or not. But first, you need to know why it is so important to evolutionists to prove that Neanderthal4 man is a separate species, and not our ancestor.\n \n The first Neanderthal skeleton was discovered in 1856, just three years before the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species. The nineteenth century evolutionists believed that apes evolved into some sub-human missing links, which evolved into man. Naturally, Neanderthal man was immediately assumed to be one of those missing links and was depicted as at the right.\n \n The more scientists learned about Neanderthal man, the more they realized he did not fit in with their theory very well. Apes supposedly got smarter as their brains gradually evolved in size from about 400 cc to modern man's 1350 cc brain.5 It was difficult to explain how a Neanderthal man, with his 1740 cc brain6, fit into this process.\n \n The Neanderthal skeletons were found in graves with hands neatly folded, surrounded by fossilized pollen. This is a pretty clear indication that they were buried with flowers in some sort of funeral ceremony. Only humans do that.\n\n So you really don't read the cut-and-pastes you post. I don't think any of us will be surprised.",

I explain to you why quote mines are not valid evidence, and how we weren't attacking your sources, but pointing out the invalidity of your support, and that makes me a \"disingenuous thug\", \"childish\", \"slander[ous]\", and \"infantile\"? It's not slander to state that you posted a bunch of quote mines in support of your position. We even tried to explain to you why they were no good.\n \n \nEveryone knows after all that for every claim on the internet is an opposing claim\n\n I already covered this in a previous post. Did you read it?\n \n \nIt is your sides M.O. to attack not only the claims made as much as attacking the sources so as to attack the oppositions credibility and honesty.\n \n\n Uh, it's a debate board. Yes, we attack your claims, especially when they are unsupported. When you post quote mines, frauds, and rhetoric as support for your claims, that either makes you incapable of basic fact checking, or dishonest. I'll let you make your own choice. Though, when it's repeatedly pointed out to you, and you respond like this, I'd have to go with dishonest.\n \n \nI will simply repeat this post to any future insults and attacks you and your cohorts level at me here\n\n Hmm, seeing as how you called me a bunch of names here after I politely responded to your cut and paste job, then took the time to try and explain to you why quote mines are a no-no, you feel free to repost this as evidence of my insult hurling and attacking of poor you. In fact, if I were you, I'd save a copy on my desktop and post it all the time.\n \n \nSo I will walk away from this debate. Of course you will call that running away\n\n When you do it in every thread that you're tactics are called on, I'd have to say it's running away. It's a pattern Archie, and not a good one.\n \n \nlet them no I retract nothing i said and let it stand against any attacks made against it.\n\n Yes, we know you retract nothing. That's why debating with you is useless. No matter how often you're proven wrong, you do just what you did here: Call anyone who opposes you dishonest, childish, bullying, etc, and run away crying \"Poor me! Luckily, I'm better than them!\"\n \n Why bother even posting here Archie, if you're just going to hurl insults and run away when confronted? This is a debate board you know.\n \n \nBefore you go, you still owe an apology for your unfounded acusation of plagiarism. Your futher libelling of other posters as \"a gang of disingenuous thugs\" not only breaches the bounds of taste and civil intercourse, but also the rules of the forum. Again.\n\n Don't hold your breath Penfold. As far as Archie's concerned, he's never wrong, and he never has to actually stand behind his allegations and prove them. Why do you think he keeps calling me a liar without actually offering any supporting evidence? It's his MO-if you can't respond, scream insults as you flee.",

   "No TQ, I've abandoned this thread to those who will distort and slander me for any rebuttal I make.\n\n \n More accurately, lack of rebuttal. I've linked three posts that directly address the issues that you've completely ignored. \n \n \nWhy waste my time attempting to reason with the likes of this gang of disingenuous thugs as you gang up on me en-masse.\n\n \n We've already refuted the numbers over quality of arguments issue. You have bad argument. If you had GOOD arguments the number of people detracting from you would not matter. Marc9000 made an similar argument and promptly abandoned it for good reason. Marc9000 has the intelligence to know when he cannot possibly ever win and when his arguments have committed an fatal error. You do not appear to share in his intellect.\n \n \nI have made the points I want to make and anyone who wishes to read my opinions on this thread, let them no I retract nothing i said and let it stand against any attacks made against it.\n\n \n And yet now you are not using personal insults, I suspect after the admin warned you of potential banning. Therefore since you stand by your opinions, which are largely based on personal insults, you must therefore still think those are good arguments. Thanks for admitting you retract nothing.\n \n We've caught you quote mining, posting false statements and generally pretending that we are attacking you when we are attacking your bad, bad, bad arguments.\n \n \nEveryone knows after all that for every claim on the internet is an opposing claim, so everyone must choose which claims they choose to believe.\n\n \n Again, this in this case has been refuted. You have been shown to use quote mining and we have linked the letters from these people who have been cited to show that they said nothing of the sort.\n \n Sure there is an opposing claim, but your claim is flat out false. I also linked three other instances of you quote mining, including one by an non-existent person.\n \n I guess when your arguments rely on statements made by people who don't exist you can make them say anything you want.\n \n \nIt is your sides M.O. to attack not only the claims made as much as attacking the sources so as to attack the oppositions credibility and honesty. The tactic is despicable, yet so you.\n\n \n Explain how posting false statements that were never made is dishonest. Furthermore, explain how posting false statements that were never made as the truth is honest. \n \n \nI will simply repeat this post to any future insults and attacks you and your cohorts level at me here.\n\n \n The thing is, AA, most new users here can figure you out for who you are. Claiming we do this when they are perfectly capable of reading and understanding our posts and yours is hardly an good argument.\n \n You can claim all you want, but when they read and conclude we are right and you are wrong...what are you going to do?\n \n Remember, this is about the Audience, not us.",
