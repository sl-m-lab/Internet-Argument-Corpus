   "Is the quote real?\n On second thought, should I be surprised by anything that he says or does?\n Are you sure he's refuring to human babies as appose to animal babies?\n In case of animal babies: Eggs are baby chickens, I believe Viel (or how ever it's spelled) is from a baby cow (along with some forms of cow's liver that's served) which I'm opposed to eating liver, but that's another story.\n If he is refering to human babies, then, well, I am sooooo against it. How dare he? He should have a baby byte him. Let's go and ban all of his movies regardless of who else is in them! emoticon_rolleyes \n Honestly, I don't think he truely said that. And if he did say that, I don't think it was serious or meant how it sounds in the quote. Wait, did he say it while jumping up and down on a couch and getting hysterical?",
