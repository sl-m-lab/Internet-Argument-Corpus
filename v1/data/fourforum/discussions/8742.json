   "Though somewhat tongue-in-cheek, this proposal is meant to bring peace to the world through freedom of worship without the threat of being bombed for it.\n \n Let's suppose that we are able to accomplish the following proposed initial step. What do you think would be the end result...say after 100 years of Athiest Control of Weapons and the Justice System?\n \n Be it hereby resolved that all explosives, firearms, chemical weapons, biological weapons and all other weapons that could be classified as weapons of mass destruction be turned over to the Atheists for control thereof. The Atheists would then be the policemen of the world.\n \n Nations would be free to attack and kill each other with blades, stones, ropes and whips, corn stalks or whatever they wanted outside the bounds of flaming or explosive weapons. No bombs, no napalm, no cannisters of chemicals, no poisoning of food or water supplies, no biological attacks, no arson...just old fashioned hand to hand combat techniques commonly used prior to the invention of gunpowder.\n \n The Atheists would stand by and watch the various religious group vye for superiority or control of lands and resources. The international courts would be run by Atheists and be chaired by Atheist judges. Any person convicted of using any of the aforementioned banned weapons would be immediately put to death. Any person known to have blown himself and others up in a suicide bombing would cause the execution death of his/her entire immediate family, to include all sibblings, parents and offspring.\n \n If any nation was threatened with total annihilation, the Atheists would step in and save a few for breeding purposes.\n \n Question:\n \n Would there come worldwide peace...eventually?\n \n Any variations and proposed modifications/additions to the above proposal are welcome if described with their expected impact on the drive toward peace.",

   "Great idea...sounds like death through warfare would drop drastically. What about the religious folk that might attempt to threaten the athiests' world domination (ie: sophisticated plots to steal WMD)? Perhaps the athiests would occasionally have to use a nuke or two to keep down the spirits of all the religious...keep them from getting any ideas. It would be similar to Caesar bringing peace to the world through oppression.\n \n What about when athiests disagree on how to rule the world? Let's say that our capitalist athiests have a disagreement with our socialist athiests. What is to prevent them on using their weapon stockpiles to help resolve their differences? Will they remain people of extraordinary virtue who will keep the end of your experiment (world peace) in mind at all times? Maybe if you paid the capitalists enough or gave enough kick backs to the socialists.",

Violence only begots more violence.\nActually, I do support such a punishment for suicide bombings that take out innocent people. Now, if a numbnut wants to stand at the lip of the Grand Canyon and blast only his own flesh into thousands of pieces as we gather around to watch the spectacle and sell concessions, I'd say we leave his/her family alone...maybe even take up a collection for the entertainment value. If that same numbnut straps on explosives and ruins lives randomly at an otherwise beautiful wedding party, I say we get rid of anyone who could have benefitted from such murderous action and destroy as much of the bomber's DNA as we possibly can.\n \n \n \n\n One factor that is important in creating world peace is that all countries follow international law to the letter with no justification for breaking it. If need be then international law in respect to human rights and ownership of land by countries should be made more in depth and stronger.\nHa! We can't even get our own people...including those from ALL walks of life...to obey the laws we have in our own country. I imagine that the difficulty in doing that is global. I contend that nobody likes being told what to do. I believe that the degree to which a set of laws forcefully particularizes life will generate a similarly varying opposition to enforcement of those laws. Even anarchy has advantages we all seem to want.\n \n \nSounds fun. Man, could you imagine all the cool video footage that could be gathered? All those HTH fights, like the middle-ages, heroes and villans fighting tooth and nail? Man, I'd so prefer that to modern-day sports.\nThe Running Man would play on huge outdoor HDTV screens duplicated in thousands of locations around Gotham City so the people could enjoy WATCHING violent death without participating.\n \n \n\n While it does sound neat from an emotional perspective, no, I don't think peace would result.
