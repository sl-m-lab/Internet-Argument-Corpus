   "Disclaimer: haven't read it and I probably won't.\n \n I don't really understand how books of this kind pass themselves off as scholarly, they virtually all follow the same basic pattern of mistakes.\n \n The free market is conflated with government action.  In a free market there is no government, but when the government bombs iraq, this is somehow the fault of the free market. When the government taxes people or prints money, and hands it over to politically connected corporations, this is blamed on the free market, rather than the government. This seems nothing more than a propagandistic attempt to divert responsibility from the government - I can hardly believe that a socialist intellectual is actually unable to distinguish between government and market, only that they are unwilling.\n \n  The free market is conflated with the thoughts or actions of prominent Americans. Bush and his cronies are depicted as free market ideologues, despite 8 years of evidence to the contrary - why, I don't know, probably because they're Americans, or Republicans. Here I again can't help but feel that the misdefinition of \"free market\" is deliberate, rather than mere ignorance. It's as if since Bush is evil, he must represent market forces. For as we know, government is good - something must have corrupted it.\n \n The free market is conflated with the thoughts of the chicago school. It is true that in some respects the chicago school of economics is more liberal than Keynesianism, but it doesn't argue the case for a free market. It can't. The Austrians do, and they have been ardently anti-war, and immensely critical of the corporatism, cronyism and fascism inherent in the war on terror... but of course, confronting the reality of that would ruin the mythical socialist narrative we have going, where war, government, corporations and the free market are intertwined.",

   "Disclaimer: haven't read it and I probably won't.\n\n Then what qualifies you to pass judgement upon it? You don't even know what it has to say - as evidenced by your wide-of-the-mark criticisms.\n \nThe free market is conflated with government action. \n\n Incorrect. The book concerns itself not with the free market per se, but with the brutal method of expansion championed by many of its most powerful advocates: disaster capitalism. It explores what happens when natural or man-made disasters are exploited to violently crack open markets, often against the democratically-expressed wishes of the local people.\n \n In other words, it's not about whether a free market economy is good or bad for people in the long run, but rather about the human consequences of the sudden, violent, nonconsensual imposition of unregulated market forces under already traumatic circumstances.\n \n When the government taxes people or prints money, and hands it over to politically connected corporations, this is blamed on the free market, rather than the government.\n\n There's a reason men who solicit sex and whores can both be arrested: they're both part of the problem. \n \n Again, it's not about the free market as an abstract, it's about people. I apologise if I've got the wrong impression, but you seem to think that a free market is what you automatically get if you remove regulations; that a free market represents a stable equilibrium. This is not the case, because people are involved. While a truly free market may be generally beneficial, there are other systems which benefit minorities disproportionately - and it is into those systems free markets tend to collapse if left unchecked, because those who do best out of the free market have the motive and have just been handed the means to take steps to consolidate their position.\n \nIn a free market there is no government, but when the government bombs iraq, this is somehow the fault of the free market.\n\n Again, this falls wide of the mark. It's not about something as abstract as 'the free market' being at fault, nor does it require any kind of corporate conspiracy theory regarding the motivation behind that invasion. The book concerns itself with the inevitability of corruption, profiteering, and human suffering in circumstances where corporations forged in a free market are unleashed upon people and governments who are in no fit state - economically, politically, or emotionally - to exert the consumer and regulatory counter-pressure required to make an emerging market meaningfully 'free'.\n \nThe free market is conflated with the thoughts of the chicago school. It is true that in some respects the chicago school of economics is more liberal than Keynesianism, but it doesn't argue the case for a free market. It can't. The Austrians do, and they have been ardently anti-war, and immensely critical of the corporatism, cronyism and fascism inherent in the war on terror... but of course, confronting the reality of that would ruin the mythical socialist narrative we have going, where war, government, corporations and the free market are intertwined.\n\n You really do need to just read the book. There's nothing mythical about disaster capitalism, its humanitarian cost, or its evolution into a self-sustaining growth industry all of its own. \n \n Markets used to dip when war or natural disaster occurred, because they threatened stability. In recent times the reverse has been true, because a huge segment of the market has positioned itself to reap vast short-term rewards from circumstances of human strife and misery. If there's one problem with a free market, that's it: if a situation is profitable, the free market will tend to reinforce and repeat it, regardless of its human cost. The market itself has no conscience; only people can provide that - and in a free market it doesn't matter if a hundred companies pass on an opportunity to profit on moral grounds if there is one who will capitalise on it. In order to avoid that kind of lowest-moral-denominator profiteering, we need regulations imposed by a state elected to represent our collective conscience.",

   "The same thing that qualifies me to pass judgement on a creationist text without reading it - I know without opening it there will be nothing I haven't already read somewhere else inside.\n\n Spoken like a true creationist :)\n \n Seriously, though, it feels slightly surreal to be lectured about what a book has to say by someone who hasn't read it. It's not a Marxist assault on the free market. The only criticism it makes of free market economics per se is that its liquidity and volatility can act as an enabler for disaster capitalism.\n \n The book primarily documents the enduring pre-eminence of the Chicago School economic shock tactics employed to forcibly crack open markets during times of national crisis, their incompatibility with democratic governance, and their short-to-mid-term effects, namely the creation of a handful of million-or-billionaires at the expense of widespread poverty. Corruption has played a part, obviously - but (at least until the Iraq war) only influenced who made the vast profits that were up for grabs, and had little or nothing to do with who lost out and to what extent.\n \n If I may reiterate: the book documents and criticises the thoughtless and inhumane manner in which the transformation to open economies has been enforced around the world. It does not say that transformation should not happen.\n \nAs I already said, I don't know how you can possibly describe Bush, Exxon-Mobil or anyone else advocating the Iraq war a \"powerful advocate\" of the free market. They're powerful advocates of lining their own pockets through government action.\n\n Again, if you had read the book, you would know that I wasn't talking about the Iraq war but the numerous occasions when the IMF has enforced economic shock tactics upon struggling states as a condition of providing them with emergency loans.\n \nYou're talking about what democracies tend to collapse into. A war isn't profitable in a market, it's profitable when there is a powerful government around with the power to steal from the people and pay for it.\n\n Or when the treasure seized exceeds the expenditure necessary to secure it. Economically speaking there's no difference between blasting a quarry face and dropping a bomb on a city, provided both acts liberate sufficiently valuable resources for the guy spending his explosives.\n \nSectors of the market have always profited from war. The reason markets don't \"dip\" now is because wars are financed with debt and inflation. It doesn't matter whether a company positions itself to profit from war, the net effect is still negative. See Bastiat's classic \"broken window fallacy\".\n\n Of course the net effect is negative. If you shoot me and take my wallet, the net economic effect is negative: instead of us having a wallet and a bullet between us, now there's only a wallet. That analysis doesn't change the fact that the wallet is now yours instead of mine. How many muggers do you think are given pause by the realisation that they are inducing a net negative economic effect?\n \nGreat as a naive ideal. In practice a state with the power to impose, imposes on its citizens and imposes on others. It's that very state currently occupying Iraq and threatening Iran.\n\n It's interesting that when I talk about what governments should do, you dismiss that as 'naive' in light of some of the things they do do - yet when someone points out the mischief corporations get up to, you're happy to defend the equally naive ideal of the free market. Short term, corporations don't want a free market. They want monopolies.\n \n A free market is good in the same way as biodiversity is good: it's ultimately more robust and adaptable. And, just like biodiversity, it's not the natural state of affairs. It needs to be actively preserved.\n \nI can't take seriously someone who identifies a problem with the occupation of iraq and believes the solution is a government that is more imposing.\n\n The solution is a government that does its job rather than outsourcing on a for-profit basis. Inefficiency may be the price we have to pay for accountability. The solution is a government that respects democracy, including the right of a people to choose a different economic path, even if all paths do ultimately lead to a free market one way or another.\n \n There was no meaningful insurgency in Iraq before the occupying forces invalidated spontaneous local elections and appointed their own state officials - and why was this done? Because %90+ of the people of Iraq wanted to retain a strong state infrastructure and subsidised essentials like food and water. What does it matter if they were wrong to want those things in the long term? The bigger picture, the overriding reality is that their way of life, their individual long-term financial plans, their national identity - all were predicated upon the economic infrastructure in place prior to the invasion. Moreover, when you've just told a people that you've liberated their country in the name of democracy, you have to follow through. Democracy is nothing if not the right to learn from your own mistakes.",

This is why advocates of the free market are highly critical of the IMF and often call for its abolition.\n\n The principle of the IMF doesn't suck. The role it is supposed to fill is as a stabiliser: providing loans to help states through difficult times (which are often not of their own contrivance). In such times, the sectors of the market that value stability aren't interested, so there's little help to be had there. I don't think it counts as 'stealing' for a government to invest in infrastructure and reconstruction on behalf of its people.\n \n The reason the IMF sucks is that it is ideologically predisposed to use its leverage to crack open vulnerable states to short-term profiteers. That, if anything, counts as 'stealing'.
