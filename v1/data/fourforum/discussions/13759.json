   "Jenn Coffey: Turning the State House into a no-self-defense zone - Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2010\n \n \nWith the Joint Facilities Committee's ban on firearms in the State House, it has become painfully obvious that some members of the Legislature have yet to learn from history.\n \n Think of all the horrific acts that have been perpetrated on the law-abiding citizens of our great nation -- Columbine, Virginia Tech, Luby's Cafe, and the list goes on. These places have one thing in common: They were all \"gun-free zones.\"\n \n It seems to elude many that when you announce to the world you are creating a \"gun-free zone,\" you are, in fact, creating a killing zone: a place where a criminal knows no one will shoot back. \n \n In each of the above incidents, the lunatic responsible had only one thing in mind -- to kill as many people as possible. In each instance, the police were called to the scene, and each time they arrived to clean up the mess.\n \n This is not meant as an attack on our police; they do the best they can. When bullets start flying, they are on average six minutes away from the scene. In some places in New Hampshire, they can be 30 minutes away. As an emergency medical technician, I know this. I have had to wait for a police officer to come and let me know a scene is safe before I can enter.\n \n There is a real reason that New Hampshire has a lower crime rate than many other states; plain and simple, the criminal element here knows that many of us have the ability and the tools necessary to defend ourselves. All you have to do is compare our state to, well, let's say our nation's capital, Washington, D.C. It may alarm you to know that there are more rapes, robberies and murders in the District of Columbia than in New Hampshire. What do they have that we don't? Very restrictive gun laws. There, the only ones with the guns are the criminals.\n \n I find it inconceivable that there are still people in our world who don't seem to understand that the people who follow the laws we create are the hard working, honest citizens of our state. Those bent on mayhem will never follow that law; that is what makes them criminals!\n \n Personally, I have received more phone calls and e-mails since the announcement of the ban than ever before. Many of the callers are women who have been victims of violent crime themselves. For some, being able to have a firearm, knife, pepper spray or some other means of self-defense and the knowledge to use it is what enables them to venture out in to the world alone.\n \n Until you have either helped someone through that type of physical and emotional pain or have been through it yourself, you cannot begin to imagine what it is like to venture out alone.\n \n Now some of these very people who would like to go to our state capital fear the idea. They fear being forced to be victims again, and they resent the legislators who are forcing them to be just that.\n",
