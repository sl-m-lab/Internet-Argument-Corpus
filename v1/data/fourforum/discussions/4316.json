Bush recalled the US ambassador to Syria Tuesday, February 15, following the killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri in Beirut. \n \n Meanwhile, the UN Security Council condemned on Tuesday the \"terrorist\" Beirut bombing, vowing to punish the killers. \n \n US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Bush summoned Ambassador Margaret Scobey back to the United States for \"urgent consultations,\" Reuters news agency reported. \n \n snip\n \n Meanwhile, the UN Security Council on Tuesday condemned the \"terrorist\" bombing in Beirut that killed Hariri and expressed concern over \"further destabilization\" in Lebanon, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported. \n \n The council also asked UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to deliver a report into Monday's killing, something the UN chief said earlier the United Nations was prepared to do. \n \n In a statement, the 15-nation council also recalled last year's resolution calling for the withdrawal of all Syrian forces from Lebanon. \n \n \"The bottom line of this statement is that other countries should get out of (Lebanon's) business,\" said Anne Patterson, the US deputy ambassador to the United Nations. \n \n \"We've had a long history of conversations with them and the message does not seem to be getting through. Syria has got to get out of Lebanon,\" Patterson added. \n \n \n\n \n Bets on what the US hoped for outcome of this bombing will be?",
