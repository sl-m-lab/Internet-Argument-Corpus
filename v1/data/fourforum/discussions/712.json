   "HOW COULD ALL THE ANIMALS GET ON BOARD NOAH'S ARK?\n - BTG No. 39b March 1992\n by John D. Morris, Ph.D.*\n \u00a9 Copyright 2003 Institute for Creation Research. All Rights Reserved.\n \" ... then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown...\" (Matthew 13:19)\n Not long ago I was interviewed on a \"news-talk\" radio show. The host was a particularly venomous anti-Christian, with a long history of ridiculing Christianity on his show. Evidently he particularly likes to ridicule creationism.\n His introductory comment was, \"You're one of those XXXXXX who believes the earth is only six-thousand years old. Tell me one thing. How did Noah get all those millions of dinosaurs onboard Noah's Ark?\"\n I asked if he knew how many dinosaurs there were. He didn't, but he knew there were too many to get on the Ark. When I explained that only about 600 species of dinosaurs had ever been named, that many species had been named from only a piece of one bone, that many of the species were probably of the same \"kind,\" that many dinosaurs were small, that God wouldn't have brought the largest specimens to Noah, and that, in my opinion, there were probably only around 100 dinosaurs onboard the Ark, with an average size of a cow, he changed his tune. But he still knew the story was ridiculous.\n Then he included all the animals-fish, whales, clams, etc.-along with the land animals. I explained that the Bible clearly teaches that it was only those \"in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land\" (Genesis 7:22) that were present on the Ark, and that, although marine animals died by the trillions in the Flood, at least representatives of each kind\" would have survived. I further speculated that insects might not have been on board, since they don't breathe air. They absorb oxygen through abdominal membranes. They could have survived, particularly in their egg and larvae states, on floating plant debris. Actually, they would be needed worldwide as the Flood ended, to help seeds and sprigs re-germinate and flourish once again.\n Restricted to only land animals and birds, this host still insisted they couldn't fit on the Ark. I asked how many there were? He didn't know, \"but they couldn't fit!\" I asked if he knew the size of the Ark. He didn't, \"but it wasn't big enough!\"\n Now, this was an amazing admission. According to him, an unknown number of animals couldn't fit onto a boat of unknown size!\n Let us honestly ask the same question: How many animals were there and how big was the Ark? Could they fit?\n The total number of land-dwelling mammals birds, reptiles, and amphibian species is less than 20,000 or so. The number of \"kinds,\" the Biblical designation, is probably much smaller. For instance, of the 9,000 bird species, approximately 400 are hummingbirds, with only minor differences in color, size, and habitat. Very likely, they all come from only one or a few kinds, thereby dropping the total number.\n The Ark itself was huge! With gross dimensions of about 450 feet by 75 feet by 45 feet, its volume was easily able to house two (or in some cases seven) of each land species, let alone kinds. The trip may have been difficult for Noah and his family, but it was possible, with God's help.\n And so it is with us. With God's help, even the tough questions have answers. We only need to study and believe.\n *Dr. John Morris is the President of ICR.",

Polar bears have webbed feet because of a \"process called friction.\"\n \nThis is not evolution. It is not a mutation. This is adaptaion.\n\n Actually, it is a mutation. Just like the color of the fur is a mutation. Polar bear fur is not white, it is colorless. Moreover, it is hollow. That is another mutation. And Polar bears have longer legs than their closest relatives, the brown bears. They have smaller ears. None of the changes are caused by \"friction\".\n \n By the way, the webs between the toes of a Polar bear are very much like the webs between the toes of a duck.\n \n Adaptation is, by the way, evolution. I presume that is the word you meant to use. Adaptation is not adaption. You talk about the process as if it were adaption and then call it adaptation. In reality it is adaptation.\n \nRight now in this house I am sweating. This is how the my body reacts to the 90 degree teperature out side. If I were to spend more time in hotter climates I would adapt in such a way that 90 degrees doesn't cause me to sweat. This is adaptaion not mutation.\n\n No. That would be adaption. It wouldn't involve any genetic change. Another word for it might aclimatization. Your example shows little thought. The Polar bear's webbed feet are genetic. Even if a Polar bear lived it's whole live in a cage without ever going near water, it would still have webbed feet.\n \n That really is absolutely the most ignorant thing I have ever heard.

It was useless to argue that even if I had been referring to the posterior part of the human anatomy, it wasn't profane - only prudes thought so.

   "It is a misconception that the flood was world wide. It was actually contained to a small portion of the earth. At the time, the world had it's entire population contained in this one geographic area.\n \n The hebrew word \"kol\" which means \"all\" and \"erets\" which means \"earth\", \"land\", \"country\", or \"ground\" has been translated as \"whole earth\" or \"all the earth.\"\n \n This is an incorrect translation.\n \n In Genesis 2:11 we find the same words to mean a portion of earth, not the whole thing. \n \n \"The name of the first is Pishon; it flows around the whole [kol] land [erets] of Havilah, where there is gold.\"\n \n And two verses later is:\n \n And the name of the second river is Gihon; it flows around the whole [kol] land [erets] of Cush.

   "Well, your debate is that a flood may have taken place in only one place. If the flood was so large that it covered up the highest mountains as far as the eye could see for every thing that was living on the planet at the time, it was probably not some small area that would have been flooded by this if the flood was realistic.\n \n I'm no expert on the Bible or anything, but my guess would be that for a flood of even this size over a large area would require a good amound of the water on earth to be put in one place. Plus I believe it is debated that this flood actually shifted a lot of continents around (at least it has been debated to me). That would mean it would have been a pretty massive flood.\n \n But, I think the debate that God added a ton of water to Earth and then removed it after the flood would make equal sense to the idea that the flood took place in just spots where life was located. Both arguments would require such abnormal affects that only God himself could have managed it and therefore both would go against all scientific thinking. So basically they are the same basic argument, that God changed the laws of physics and/or nature to accomplish this flood. But I could be wrong.",

You seem to realize that the problem with where the water went has no rational answer, so you just assert that the oceans were really shallow ponds and the mountains were just hills.\n \n So in just a few years about 4000 years, all of the mountains were built from little hills. That presents you with another problem. You see, the mechanics of mountain building are understood, at least the basics. And there is one inescapable fact associated with it - it produces heat and lots of it. Don't you think such events would have been noticed and recorded in the Bible?\n \n Now I already know that you are going to tell me that the \"time of Peleg\" is when all of this happened. So mountains were pushed up 5 miles into the sky in the life of one man. Again, what happened to the heat. The heat that would have been produced by existing mountains is enough to reduce the surface of earth to molten rock if it is crammed into even a few hundred years.\n \n But most of all, do you have any evidence, any at all, that the oceans used to be shallow and the mountains used to be hills.

Now I have asserted all along that there is no evidence FOR the universal flood of Noah, and you seem to be saying that I am correct because it is a miracle. POOF - Goddidit. There isn't any scientific evidence.\n \n But that presents you with a whole new problem. You see, there is lots of evidence that the flood never happened, at least not the universal flood proposed by YECs. The variety of geologic strata with some layers obviously laid down in an acquatic environment, some obviously deposited on dry land, some obvious volcanic deposits - you can see examples of all of these in the walls of the Grand Canyon - all laid down in varying, random orders around the world in such a way that their deposit by a single global flood is impossible. The almost unfailing order of the fossil record where organisms that existed in similar environments, with similar physiology are never found together. For example, dolphins and never found in the same strata as ichthyosaurs even though the had similar body shapes, lived in similar environments, had similar diets, and were about the same size. Ichthyosaurs are always found in older strata than dolphins.\n \n So here's your problem. If the flood is a miracle but actually happened, the evidence to the contrary means that your god created it. In other words, you god lied to us by making it appear that there was no flood. So now divine revelation, that must be accepted without evidence, says God did it one way and the physical evidence of God's creation says He did it in another way. If we use our minds and logic to work out the history of the earth we are being duped by a lie of God and are subject to damnation. If we accept the Bible without evidence, we look like fools for denying reality.\n \n Do you see the problem?",

And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of... the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A window shalt thou make in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side therof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\" (Gen. 6:14-16)\n \n Most Hebrew scholars believe the cubit to have been no less than 18 inches long [45.72 centimeters]. This means that the ark would have been at least 450 feet long [137.16 meters], 75 feet wide [22.86 meters] and 45 feet high [13.716000000000001 meters]. Noah's Ark was said to have been the largest sea-going vessel ever built until the late nineteenth century when giant metal ships were first constructed. Its length to width ratio of six to one provided excellent stability on the high seas. In fact, modern shipbuilders say it would have been almost impossible to turn over. In every way, it was admirably suited for riding out the tremendous storms in the year of the flood. \n These dimensions are especially interesting when compared to those given in the mythical, Babylonian account of the Ark. Here the ark is described as a perfect cube, extending 120 cubits in all directions and with nine decks. Such a vessel would spin slowly round and round in the water and from the standpoint of stability, would be a disaster. \n \n But was the ark big enough to hold the number of animals required? \n The total available floor space on the ark would have been over 100,000 square feet, which would be more floor space than in 20 standard-sized basketball courts. \n \n The total cubic volume would have been 1,518,000 cubic feet [462,686.4 cubic meters] --that would be equal to the capacity of 569 modern railroad stock cars. \n Now comes the question, how many land dwelling air breathing animals would have had to be taken aboard the ark to survive the flood? \n According to Ernest Mayr, America's leading taxonomist, there are over 1 million species of animals in the world.\n \n However, the vast majority of these are capable of surviving in water and would not need to be brought aboard the ark. Noah need make no provision for the 21,000 species of fish or the 1,700 tunicates (marine chordates like sea squirts) found throughout the seas of the world, or the 600 echinoderms including star fish and sea urchins, or the 107,000 mollusks such as mussels, clams and oysters, or the 10,000 coelenterates like corals and sea anemones, jelly fish and hydroids or the 5,000 species of sponges, or the 30,000 protozoans, the microscopic single-celled creatures. \n In addition, some of the mammals are aquatic. For example, the whales, seals and porpoises. The amphibians need not all have been included, nor all the reptiles, such as sea turtles, and alligators. Moreover, a large number of the arthropods numbering 838,000 species, such as lobsters, shrimp, crabs and water fleas and barnacles are marine creatures. And the insect species among arthropoda are usually very small. Also, many of the 35,000 species of worms as well as many of the insects could have survived outside the Ark. \n \n How many animals needed to be brought aboard?\n Doctors Morris and Whitcomb in their classic book, \"The Genesis Flood,\" state that no more than 35,000 individual animals needed to go on the ark. In his well documented book, Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study, John Woodmorappe suggests that far fewer animals would have been transported upon the ark. By pointing out that the word \"specie\" is not equivalent to the \"created kinds\" of the Genesis account, Woodmorappe credibly demonstrates that as few as 2,000 animals may have been required on the ark. To pad this number for error, he continues his study by showing that the ark could easily accommodate 16,000 animals.)\n \n But, let's be generous and add on a reasonable number to include extinct animals. Then add on some more to satisfy even the most skeptical. Let's assume 50,000 animals, far more animals than required, were on board the ark, and these need not have been the largest or even adult specimens. \n Remember there are really only a few very large animals, such as the dinosaur or the elephant, and these could be represented by young ones. Assuming the average animal to be about the size of a sheep and using a railroad car for comparison, we note that the average double-deck stock car can accommodate 240 sheep. Thus, three trains hauling 69 cars each would have ample space to carry the 50,000 animals, filling only 37% of the ark. This would leave an additional 361 cars or enough to make 5 trains of 72 cars each to carry all of the food and baggage plus Noah's family of eight people. The Ark had plenty of space. \n The bigger problem would have been the construction of the Ark. But the Bible indicates that Noah did this under Divine guidance and there is no reason to believe he did not hire additional workmen. \n \n How were the animals gathered? \n Another enormous problem some have posed is the problem of gathering specimens of each kind of air-breathing land animal and bringing them aboard the Ark. However, the Genesis account indicates that God gathered the animals and brought them to Noah inside the ark two by two. Some have suggested this may have involved the origin of animal migratory instincts or, at least, an intensification of it. We also know that most animals possess the ability to sense danger and to move to a place of safety. \n \n How could Noah's family take care of all those animals? \n Once aboard, many have suggested that Noah's problems really began, with only 8 people to feed and water, to provide fresh air and sanitation for the huge menagerie of animals for a total of 371 days. However, a number of scientists have suggested that the animals may have gone into a type of dormancy. It has been said that in nearly all groups of animals there is at least an indication of a latent ability to hibernate or aestivate. Perhaps these abilities were supernaturally intensified during this period. With their bodily functions reduced to a minimum, the burden of their care would have been greatly lightened. \n \n Conclusion \n It is evident, when all the facts are examined that there is no scientific evidence that the biblical account of Noah's ark is a myth or fable. The facts support the view that Noah's ark was large enough to carry the number of animals required to repopulate the earth after the flood and that Noah and his family were capable of caring for the animals during their time on the Ark.",

   "That is why the oceans are so deep, and why there are folded mountain ranges. Indeed, if the entire earth's surface were levelled by smoothing out the topography of not only the land surface but also the rock surface on the ocean floor, the waters of the ocean would cover the earth's surface to a depth of 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers). We need to remember that nearly 70 percent of the earth's surface is still covered by water. Quite clearly, then, the waters of Noah's Flood are in today's ocean basins. \n \n A Mechanism? \n The catastrophic plate tectonics model gives a mechanism for the deepening of the oceans and the rising of mountains at the end of the flood. \n As the new ocean floors cooled, they would have become denser and sunk, allowing water to flow off the continents. Movement of the water off the continents and into the oceans would have weighed down the ocean floor and lightened the continents, resulting in the further sinking of the ocean floor, as well as upward movement of the continents.[2] The deepening of the ocean basins and the rising of the continents would have resulted in more water running off the land. \n The collision of the tectonic plates would have pushed up mountain ranges also, especially toward the end of the flood. \n \n Could the Water Cover Mt. Everest? \n Mount Everest is more than 5 miles (8 kilometers) high. How, then, could the flood have covered \"all the high hills under the whole heaven?\" \n The Bible refers only to \"high hills,\" and the mountains today were formed only toward the end of, and after, the flood by collision of the tectonic plates and the associated upthrusting. In support of this, the layers that form the uppermost parts of Mount Everest are themselves composed of fossil-bearing, water-deposited layers. \n This uplift of the new continental landmasses from under the Flood waters would have meant that, as the mountains rose and the valleys sank, the waters would have rapidly drained off the newly emerging land surfaces. The collapse of natural dams holding back the flood waters on the land would also have caused catastrophic flooding. Such rapid movement of large volumes of water would have caused extensive erosion and shaped the basic features of today's earth surface. \n \n Thus, it is not hard to envisage the rapid carving of the landscape features that we see on the earth today, including places such as the Grand Canyon of the United States.\n \n The present shape of Uluru (Ayers Rock), as sandstone monolith in central Australia, is the result of erosion, following tilting and uplift, of previously horizontal beds of water-laid sand. The feldspar-rich sand that makes up Uluru must have been deposited very quickly and recently. Long-distance transport of the sand would have caused the grains to be rounded and sorted, whereas they are jagged and unsorted. If they had sat accumulating slowly in a lake bed drying in the sun over eons of time, which is the story told in the geological display at the park center, the feldspar would have weathered into clay.\n \n \n Likewise, if Uluru had sat in the once-humid area of central Australia for millions of years, it would have weathered to clay.[3] Similarly, the nearby Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) are composed of an unsorted mixture of large boulders, sand, and mud, indicating that the material must have been transported and deposited very rapidly. \n The erosion caused by receding flood waters is the reason that river valleys are far larger than the rivers now flowing in them could have carved. The water flow that carved the river valleys must have been far greater than the volume of water we see flowing in the rivers today. This is consistent with voluminous flood waters draining off the emerging land surfaces at the close of Noah's flood, and flowing into the rapidly sinking, newly prepared, deep ocean basins. \n Our understanding of how the flood could have occurred is continually developing. Ideas come and go, but the fact of the flood remains. Genesis clearly testifies to it, Jesus and the apostles confirmed it, and there is abundant global geological evidence for a global watery cataclysm",

   "Contental dirft is not a new idea.\n\n Abraham Ortelius, a Dutch mapmaker, noticed in 1596 that North and South America fit against Europe and Africa. The idea was again stated by Antonio Snider-Pellegrini in 1858 (that's the year before publication of Darwin's book). Alfred Lothar Wegener again put forth the idea in 1912. The reception to the idea was less than enthusiastic. There were a few who supported the idea and little by little the evidence grew that the theory was correct. The bit of evidence that ended all debate was the measurment of the movement of North America away from Europe. Instruments are so accurate that it can be determined that in relationship the Europe and Africa, the Americas are moveing to the west. India has been measured to still be moving north. In fact, the Tibeten plateau is still rising a few centimeters a year. Of course, India pushing into the southern edge of Asia pushed up the sediments from the bottom of the Tethys Sea, and some of this lithified sediment can now be found on the tops of the Himalayas. \n \nThe theory of pangea (One continent Earth) fits the Biblical early Earth.\n\n Yeah, but everything that creationists can't deny is claimed to fit the Biblical picture. Please cite the verses. How could all of this tectonic activity have happened in just a few few years after the mythical flood?

   "Contental dirft is not a new idea. The theory of pangea (One continent Earth) fits the Biblical early Earth.

(see below)\n \n \nThey moved and continue to move.\n\n \n True. But how fast do they move? I can't find it out, but I do know that Hawaii is moving about 3 inches per year, closer to Asia I believe.\n \n \n Now, lets do some math:\n \n Assume: The earth is young. 10,000 years ago the flood happened, which set the continental drift in motion (according to you). \n Assume: New York City and Lisbon, Portugal (2 random cities that are on the Atlantic Ocean, one in North America, the other in Europe) are 5400 km (3350 miles) apart.\n \n 10,000 years is the equivalent of 3.1536 x 10^11 seconds. 5400 km is the equivalent of 5.4 x 10^6 meters. \n \n Using a simple formula, V = d/t (where V is velocity, d is distance and t is time) we can find out the average velocity at which North America has moved away from Europe over 10,000 years.\n \n V = d/t\n V = (5.4 x 10^6 m) / (3.1536 x 10^11 seconds)\n V = 1.712 x 10^-5 m/s (0.00001712 m/s)\n \n Seems pretty slow doesn't it? Well, that is the same as 6.164 x 10^-5 km/h (or 3.829 x 10^-5 mph for the weirdo's still using the imperial system ;) ). Still seems kinda slow?\n \n To put that in perspective then, North America, over the course of 10,000 years, moved on average about 540 meters per year (about a third of a mile). When Columbus reached the coast of North America, in 1492, North America would have been about 276 km (171 miles) closer to Europe than it is today, at that rate.\n \n I think we can both agree that that number is ludicrous (we better be able to...). \n \n Remember though, that number was on average. Let's assume that we are now moving about 3 inches per year, about 7.6 cm. \n \n That means that there had to be times when NA was moving at about 1080 meters per year, just to balance out the average.\n \n \n So it turns out, that if the earth is indeed young, then Pangaea is an impossibility.",

   "The only problem with the math is the distance traveled in the first year would have been greater than the years following. As crim as stated to much speed causes friction and heat.\n\n I don't know where Crim mentioned that. I didn't see it. But I mentioned that the creationist scenario would melt the continents and boil the oceans. It isn't a matter of \"to [sic] much speed\", it is a matter of any speed at all. The effects of movement of the tectonic plates is visible all over the world. Volcanos and earth quakes. If the separation of the continents hapened in only 4500 years, the earth would still be molten and all the water on earth would be steam. The problem in dissapating the heat isn't with how fast the continents move but with how much time it takes. You see, the movement of the continents from Pangaea to where they are now would produce the same amount of heat no matter how fast they move. The heat isn't a problem if the movement took 225 million years. Plenty of time to dissapate. It is a problem in 4500 years.\n \nThe amount of heat I do not know I am not a geologist.\n\n Want me to ask one for you? I know a professor of geology.\n \n By the way, measurements of the sediment on the ocean floor indicate that the rate of spread has been fairly constant. There is less sediment near the mid ocean ridge and more near the continents. There is no sign of rapid movement.\n \nWould the amount of water disperse said heat I do not know.\n\n Some of it - by boiling away. It would have made the atmosphere a pressure cooker.\n \nI would gather there is a speed which would accomplish this transformation without boiling the oceans as crim stated.\n\n Again, I believe that I was the one who stated that. But to answer the question, yes there is a speed at which the movement could be accomplished without boiling the oceans. Unfortunately, that speed is much too slow to separate the continents in 4500 years. To separate the continents in 4500 years results in a molten earth and steam atmosphere.\n \nAt what measuerment and what degree we can never know. We can't ever duplicate the senario.\n\n We don't have to. The amount of heat can be calculated. Even with conservative numbers it just doesn't work.\n \n The creationist answer is to either ignore the problem entirely and pretend that it doesn't exist or to invent an ad hoc answer based on no evidence and call it a theory. Here's one: As the moving continents boiled the oceans, bubbles of steam would rise to the upper atmosphere where the heat would radiate to space while the vapor would condense and fall back to earth as cooling rain. Isn't that cute?\n \n By the way, the moving continents aren't the only heat problem for creationists. Let me first point out a fact of physics. If you add heat to water you can turn it into water vapor. When the vapor becomes water again it releases the heat. Now consider rain for 40 days with enough water to flood the whole earth. That much vapor would release enough heat to raise the temperature of the atmosphere above boiling.\n \nI do know that fossils of Ocean life can be found at every elevation including high mountains. And similar formations at diffrent contential locations.\n\n I'm not sure what your point is here, but yes, marine fossils can be found in mountains. I don't mean lying around on top of the mountains, but IN the mountains. Much of the Himalayas is composed of rock that was deposited on a sea floor, covered over where it lithified (a slow process), and then lifted to where it is now. The marine fossils in the mountains are not \"flood\" deposits.",
