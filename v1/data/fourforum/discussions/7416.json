   "Look, anyone who denies the holocaust is just whacked. \n\n \n Well technically, a \"Holocaust\" is the end of the world-- and we're still here, so that's out; literally, it means some sort of holy death-laser that destroys everything and everyone, and so far we've escaped the Death Star. Therefore you have to define \"holocaust,\" since I DO deny that the world was destroyed.\n \n Now if you mean Hitler and the Nazis killing 6 million Jews internment at death-camps, then you'll also have to define \"deny.\" \n This can mean anyone who doesn't accept it blindly, and hasn't seen any precise, accurate data on it. Likewise, Hitler is purported to have killed larger numbers of Gentiles, so one might begin to question the emphasis on ethnicity.\n \n Naturally, controversy is the antithesis of objectivity-- as the Civil War proves; and therefore one would do well to remain additionally neutral and skeptical in sifting through the data. For example, history is written by the victors, while the stories of the vanquished are suppressed; therefore if someone says that others HAVE to believe the numbers and other allegations without a shred of proof other than films that show far less than six million people-- and likewise that show mostly people who obviously starved to death-- just like the 30-100 million others under socialism-- , and attempts to force others to admit and even believe it, then there's no reason for any rational person to tolerate that without question, let alone concur with it; rather, there's every reason to stand firm and demand proof.\n \n And if \"it doesn't matter\" whether whether 6 million or less than 6 million-- or by different causes, i.e. \"it's just as bad either way,\" then there's certainly no harm in knowing the exact number and cause; and so much the more, if it IS better or worse, depending. Rather, denials of relevance seem to mask a hidden agenda.\n \n Likewise there's the matter of selective hypocrisy, i.e. decrying the deaths of a select group of 6 million under socialism as the ultimate evil, but showing convenient indifference to the 100+ million killed by socialism elsewhere in the same era. Once again, a hidden agenda is obvious.\n \n No rational, intelligent person will accept hype and rumor from an obviously biased source, but will demand precise, reliable and accurate information, not propoganda. Likewise, a savvy person will not kill the messenger, but will question his motive when the story doesn't add up.",
