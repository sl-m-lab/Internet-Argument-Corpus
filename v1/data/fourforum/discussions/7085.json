There isn't many questions about how many branches of government we have or how the government is set up. The part that may be considered vague is the judicial branch but with a little bit of background it suddenly becomes not vague. You can interperate the 9th and 10th amendments however you want but it just doesn't mean that. abortion and same sex marriage are reserved for the states or people as you say though. You forget the other part of that amendment. The 9th amendment could also been seen as vague but the better way to look at it is useless...it just says don't misuse the constitution to further your own cause..in other words, find loopholes. I guess that is only mildly important.",

It is there to protect our rights, the states do the rest. The federal government is only there to defend the country and make sure a state doesn't violate one of the basic rights of life, liberty, and property. They specifically weren't specific because stuff like gay marriage or marriage in general doesn't belong in the federal government. Their only flaw is they didn't forsee the corruption of politicians but it's pretty obvious. We let people make laws giving them more power.
