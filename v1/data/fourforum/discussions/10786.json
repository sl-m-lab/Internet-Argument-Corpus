   "Since politics are often a joke, I thought I'd might give a running commentary on the 2008 political election.\n \n To date, we have seen the Iowa Caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.\n \n In IA., the aryans proved they had a sense of humor in selecting Mike Huckabee (for both his religious stance and sense of shared humor) and Sen. Barack Obama (because they thought it funny to give a black man a sense of 'hope'...even though they have no real plans to vote for him again).\n \n In NH. Sen. Clinton proves her acting skillz know no limit and cries like a sissy for votes. I'd do the same myself of course. Heck, I'd throw a hissy fit over not being first in line to the buffet. \n Early polls showed that Sen. Barack Obama was in the lead. After wards, he was heard to exclaim \"I thought the young white chicks here liked a man with a 12 inch schlong for a 12 inch schlong is what I have. Yet, for Bubbles they voted for as it was Bubbles who won the election here in New Hampshire where this election was held. If you didn't want to vote for me then you didn't have to sleep with me. For it is widely known that you all want to sleep with me as the Reuters polls have stated. So if it was me who you slept with then it is me you should have voted for. For that is the deal. Not Bubbles, who won the election here in New Hampshire but for me who is also here is New Hampshire...where the election is held.\"\n \n Baracks father spoke on his behalf stating \"Hope and optimism are part of Baracks platform. Hope and optimism is Baracks platform. The issues that trouble America can be solved with hope and optimism. For hope and optimism can solve problems and troubles that America has. So Baracks platform can solve America's troubles with hope and optimism. Every since the beginning, Barack has had hope for optimism and was optimistic about hope. So, I do not know why the voters chose Bubbles. Bubbles isn't even a true democrat of hope and optimism but is a member of the party of evil. The same party of evil that saw Sen. McEvil voted in New Hampshire as their demon of choice. And he is evil as he will hold the world hostage for one million dollars if elected president of America. And terrible things he will do to if unless he is given one million dollars if elected as president of America. For it is America he is running for office as president of. I know, I talked to him once that one time I talked to him. So, if you have hope and optimism, you should vote for Barak and not Bubbles. For Bubbles is a member of the party of Evil and is seeking to steal votes away from Barack so you should vote for Barack and not Bubbles who is stealing his votes and has no hope or optimism.\n \n Mrs Obama was also interviewed and said \"Sen. McEvil took all my Mojo...'s optimism and hope and now he is despondant and listless.\"\n \n Baracks father interjected asking \"Don't you have a little mojo in you hon?\" To which she replied \"No.\" Barack's father then exclaimed \"Do you want some?\"\n \n The happy couple were last seen heading to Barack's campaign van.\n \n Later, when asked if her tears had any effect on the vote, Sen. Clinton responded \"Would Bill's have been better?\"\n About 3 minutes into the interview, her speech became sluggish and body movements stiltish. Former president Bill Clinton and a couple of Hillary's personal assistants showed up with a crate with a packing lable addressed 'Stepford' and pushed Hillary inside.\n Bill stated, off the record, that he's been having sporadic troubles with her every since he had her delt with following the attack by the lying republican party who sought to have him impeached for something that was 'none of their business.' He said he had Dr. Phil waiting to deal with her 'exhausted' state with a fresh charge. He did state he anticipated once again \"sitting in the oval office getting his hair blown again...next to Hillary of course.\"\n \n Sen. McCain was asked to comment on his victory but said he had to rush off and campaign on his death star, making quotation marks with his fingers as he said it.\n \n \n More coverage by Zardoz to come.",

   "Hmmm...your racism is showing, Zardoz.\n\n \n Nah, just a lack of PCism.\n \n Otherwise you'd have interjected homophobia too. ;)\n Heck, even sexism...\n \n If aware of pop-culture, you'd see the tie-ins. \n Obama has a cosmopolitan appeal...but has a redundant speech pattern. He also oozes charisma (mojo).\n Who better to represent this that his fathers Mojo Jojo and Austin Powers.\n And I don't know about you but I do see a resemblence with McCain...and Dr. Evil.\n And Sen. Clinton as a Stepford wife.\n \n Or maybe Mike Huckabee as a Forest Gump...\"Hi, I'm Mike Huckabee. My friends call me Mike Huckabee. You can call me Mike Huckabee too. I learnt how to play the guitar when I was a wee lass in my dad's church. I'd like to share a song that conveys my plans for America. It goes a little something like this...\" *begins playing Amish Paradise by Weird Al.*\n \"Now, some may say that that is like how Bill played his Sax for people to show how cool he was. Well, I'd like to think I have a little bit of Bill in me. And after 8 years of his presidency, I think we all have a little bit of Bill in us. My doctors gave me a laxitive to help vacate it. Do you really want him back?\"\n \n And, is it racism to note (in passing) that some states have a dominance of one type of 'race' compared to others? If the pundits claim that IA has mostly white voters and others claim that whites, in the end won't vote for a black candidate when crunch time hits, is that racism? Or just pointing out the obvious? It's like trying to find the minority child's photo on 1st Birthdays on the MN TV show, 'Showcase Minnesota' (and no, I'm not a MN resident). I think 1 in 200 might be one...usually a normal looking child shown after the blonde kid named 'Sunshine Einstatzgruppen' or 'William Judenfrei'. \n \n Right now, I'm reviewing Sen. Hillary Clinton's directives and desires for the US.",
