   "Few people are aware of the fact that the issues concerning the borders of a Palestinian State, Sharon's Wall, the Jerusalem issue, and all of the other debating going on between Israel and the Palestinians, Refugees, and Arabs are just a distraction from the most important question the Israelis must focus on. \n \n For the time being, I will leave this thread as is, and ask for some critical thinking: What you think the most important issue Israel should focus on, and Either: What alternatives they have, OR What they will do?\n _________________\n Given the population curent growth rates in Israel....\n \n Snippet From: Sounding the Alarm About Israel's Demographic Crisis \n by LARRY DERFNER JANUARY 9, 2004\n http://www.kiwiingenuity.org/smutraker/archives/002049.html\n \n \"Soffer, head of the geography department at the University of Haifa and a longtime lecturer at the Israeli army's Staff and Command College\n ...\n To defuse that \"time bomb,\" Soffer would give the Palestinians all of Gaza and 85% to 90% of the West Bank, excluding small sections just over the Green Line where the Jewish settlements are concentrated - roughly the sections now being surrounded by the new security fence. He used to insist on Israel's keeping the Jordan Valley - the thinly populated band of territory in the West Bank along the Jordan River - to deter Iraq from coming through Jordan and invading Israel. But the American takeover of Iraq, he said, \"means that the threat on Israel's eastern border no longer exists.\" Now he favors giving the Jordan Valley to the Palestinians: \"Let them have it,\" he said. He would also give up East Jerusalem - \"Who needs it? Let Arafat take it and go to hell,\" he said - except for the places holy to Jews like the Temple Mount and Mount of Olives.\n \n In addition, he would make border adjustments for the Palestinians\u00c7 giving them small sections on the Israeli side of the Green Line where Umm el-Fahm, Baka al-Gharbiya and several other Israeli Arab towns and villages lie.\n \n \"If such a course is carried out, there will remain within the bounds of Israel in 2020 an Arab population of 1,300,000, [while the] Jewish population will then number six million. These are statistics that a Jewish-Zionist Israel can digest.\" If the borders don't change, he added, current population trends point in 2020 to 6,300,000 Jews in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza combined - alongside 8,740,000 Arabs.\"\n --------------------------------------------------\n Within 20 years Israel's Arab population will exceed the Jewish population,\n assuming there is no change to the current borders of Israel. \n https://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/1/11/124803.shtml\n -------------------------------------------------\n This just might give people reason to wonder why the issue itself, and the implications of that issue are virtually unknown outside of Israel, and for all intensive purposes not even mentioned. \n \n POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR YOUR REPLIES AND TO DISCUSS.\n 1)What possible scenarios exist?\n 2)What do you suppose Israel will or will not do? \n 3)What scenario would you prefer?

   "Or were you refering to the part about Israel being a racist state because of their preferential treatment of Jews? This is a no brainer. Preferential treatment of any class of people based on race is racism, it is, in fact, one of the definitions of racism as defined by websters. If you are one of the few who want to argue that the term jewish refers to a religion, not a race, this is possibly even worse than the racial issue. \n \n America is supposed to stand for freedom, equality, and all that is good in the world. We have absolutly no buisness propping up a corrupt, racist regime like israel. Our laws strictly prohibit preferential treatment of a person based on race or religion. This should extend to foreign policy as well.\n \n For some reason (like a powerful Jewish lobby) we have broken the rules for israel. Even by our own standards for supporting foreign entities, our support of israel is WRONG. By our own rules when dealing with foreign entities, we should be supporting the palestenians. I personally don't think they need our support, though. As I said before, all we need to do is withdraw our support from israel and they will crumble. They don't have the infastructure, the natural resources, or the military expertise to survive on their own without American support. \n \n How is the situation in Isreal today any different than the situation in Bosnia several years ago? In bosnia, the serbs were the ruling class, they held all the government jobs, they ruled. Eventually, they went off the deep end and began the whole ethnic cleansing thing.\n \n The difference between Bosnia of ten years ago and the israel of today is that today, the United States pumps billions of dollars worth of \"humanitarian\" aid and military aid each year into israel.

   "I disagree. Israel would not fall if the arab population dawarfed the Jewish population, except possibly if they continue to mistreat the arab population as they have. History shows us that in a situation such as this, the Jewish population of israel can expect to have its misdeeds repaid tenfold. A continued policy such as they have today, will undoubtedly lead to revolution. \n \n The only hope I see for the survival of israel as a nation is to immediatly return the palestenian territories to the palestenians. No aparthied wall, not unreasonable sanctions. By doing this, countries which are currently friendly with israel would actually have some leverage to force normalised relations with the rest of the middle east. \n \n I think this would also solve the \"problem\" of the Jews being outnumbered. Considering the historical differnences between the Jews and the Arabs, I think it is highly unlikely that there would be many Arabs that would stay in an all Jewish nation. Everybody is happy.\n \n As things stand today, you have israel illegally holding Palestine. Ther eis no question that this is against international law. They treat the Palestenians and the Arabs as second class citizens, which is deplorable, and they make demands on the Palestenian authority which are impossible as a condition for them to desist in their illegal behavior.\n \n As things stand today, I don't believe that the government of israel is at all sincere in it's efforts for peace. Sharon professes an interest in peace, while ordering the assasination of Palestnian leaders. There is a reason that assasination of leaders is not generally considered a sound practice in war. The biggest of these is, who surrenders if you have destroyed the entire leadership of the opposition. \n \n If Israel does not change their policy towards the Palestenians, they will eventually be outnumbered and their vision of a Jewish state will be destroyed. As is, they have American support and theri enemies have become our enemies. I do not want to see any more Americans die becuse of our relationship with such a morally ambigous nation.\n \n If the Arabs eventually outnumber the Jews in israel, so be it. If the minorities eventually outnumber the whites in America, so be it. Life would be different, but that is the nature of the world. Things change. The destruction that has occured in other societies as the result of such a change has never to my knowledge been the result of the new majority, but rather the result of the old regime desperatly clinging to their power. \n \n With israels history of using it's military to attack the Palestenians, I would not be at all suprised to see that, as they see their power threatened, they escalate the atrocities they are already instigating against Arab population.",

If they continue under their current policy of oppression against the arabs, I am certain that they will find their atrocities revisited on them ten fold. \n \n I have heard the \"it's just not possible for them to get along\" argument. Unfortunatly, the facts don't back it up. Take Egypt, for example, they have normalised relations with israel. I don't think that they would get along. India does not get along with Pakistan. North Korea does not get along with South Korea. You don't have to \"get along\" with people, you just have to keep from killing them. That should be easy enough.\n \n Also, I would actually question the original posting on this thread. The numbers I see for the state of israel suggest that the ascertation made at the beginning of this thread is incorrect. The Jews far outnumber the Arabs and will continue to do so for years to come in Israel.

(THAT, in JUST \n 40 years!) The same could be said in less time for South Africa.\n \n The racism and violence are little different than what has been going on with Israel for the past 55+ years. Such was NOT ALWAYS the state of affairs in that part of the world, need it always be.\n \n I don't give the arguments of self-preservation anymore credibility nor morality, than I would give such arguments made by any country, race, religion, or ethnic group.\n \n THE CHALLENGE Israel is facing is HOW to accomplish, what other Nations have accomplished, NOT to think in racist policies nor of how to create an ethnically pure State.",

   "You think the Jews and Arabs will ever get along as long as Israel stands? What will the Arabs do once Israel is a majority Arabs? Put two and two together. Politically they could run the country anyway they wanted to and virtually take control of it without having to go to war. In any democratic system the majority has the final word hence the reason the Jews should worry about the increasing Arab population there.\n\n \n AMD4EVER, \"What will the Arabs do once Israel is a majority Arabs?\"\n \n That question is truely a no brainer!\n \n The Arabs won't have any reason to attack it!!!\n \n For christ's sake! Once Israel accepts all but the extremists, the Arabs they live with will not only help the Jews destroy the Arab extremists, but the Jews, must and will help the Arabs, by dsetroying their own extremists.\n That is the way things must go to live together. It absolutely can be done, and if Israel and the Arabs who are in the occupied territories, refugee camps, and citizens of Israel will need to be made to understand that, as well.\n \n BTW. I do agree, that Israel MUST return the occupied territories. They have enough of a problem already, and they certainly do not need to compound it with Arabs in the Occupied territories, NOR in a separate Palestinian State that will have no resources with which to make an Economy for themselves.\n \n The separate State idea seems frought with too many problems to represent a REAL solution for a viable Palestinian State, and in my view, will not put off the Arab extremists from attacking Israel, nor solve the problems of the Palestinians either.",

   "\n ....\n Also, I would actually question the original posting on this thread. The numbers I see for the state of israel suggest that the ascertation made at the beginning of this thread is incorrect. The Jews far outnumber the Arabs and will continue to do so for years to come in Israel. I think that the first message should have read \"Th Arabs will soon outnumber the Jews in israel and the illegally held Palestenian territories\".\n \n\n \n daewoo, re: the numbers in the original posting of this thread are not secret.\n They are based on projections that were reported in the N.Y. Times, and as best as I can recal them. I can tell you 3 things:\n \n 1.) The projections are not based on biased sources.\n 2.) The projections can be found. \n (I would try googling: Israel Arab population projections) \n 3.) The projections I recal are not far off, from the known projections.\n \n I believe that this is the #1 issue in the Israeli-Arab conflict, and if more people were aware of it, the public dialog and the dialog in the media would change dramatically, as the current conflicts and solutions MUST consider \n what is both moral, and will be faced in Israel's very near future.",

   "The problem with the numbers I have found on the internet is that the majority of them do not seperate the state of Israel from the illegally occupied Palestenian territories. The actual nation of israel is overwhelmingly Jewish. The illegally occupied territories are overwhelmingly Arab.\n \n Most countries on the planet are multi-ethinic. The nearest town to me is a small town. There is a large mexican minority there. They celebrate their holidays, all live an a certain part of town (entirely by choice), and you are as likely to hear the guy in front of you at Wal mart speaking spanish as english. How have they lost their culture? They haven't.\n \n I have also traveled extensively in the middle east, and from my personal experience, your average Arab does not hate Jews. Your average Arab does not hate israel. Your average Arab hates the way that israel treats Arabs. In contrast, the average Jew in israel hates Arabs. They feel that the Arab positions in regards to israel are completely unfounded. It's liek they are driving with their eyes closed.\n \n As far as the Ameriucan support of israel being unconditional, I think that it needs to become conditional in short order. If I was pres bush, when I said \"don't build the aparthied wall\" and they kept building, I would have pulled the plug on foreign aid to them so fast it would have made their heads spin. \n \n American politicians don't take a harder line w/ israel because they are afraid of loosing the \"Jewish vote\". I don't think this would be as big a problem as they might imagine. A Jewish guy I work with about took my head off when I used the word \"zionist\" in reference to jews. When you see press releases and speeches come out of israel, they use the two terms pretty interchangably. I learned (at a high volume) that they are not the same. \n \n If anybody is interested, you can take a look at http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/ that is the site I was told to look at for the difference. My buddy doesn't take the \"there should be no state of israel because the tora forbids it\" line, but he does refer to the zionists who are running israel as \"ignorant, murdering terrorists who have done more to harm the Jewish people than anybody, except maybe Hitler, in the last thousand years\".",

   "========================================\n ==== The Alternatives: Ethnic/Racial Purity =======\n ========================================\n \n Israel is not so terribly unique. The Israeli Jews are really facing the same problem (IN REGARD TO WHAT THIS THREAD IS CONCERNED WITH), that the Whites in South Africa faced before it became a Democracy.\n \n I really don't see how ANY justification could be made by anyone for an ethnically pure, racist Nation. Israel would betray itself, and all the people that support it, were it to seek a solution that involved ethnic cleansing in Israel. The outcry in the U.S. by Jews , and Gentiles alike, would be enormous. And no politician would bo up against it, to punish Israel very severely for any action that involved anything remotely like ethnic cleansing, FOR ANY REASON!\n \n There is ONE AND ONLY initial problem that you need to resolve and come to grips with, in order to provide ANY viable solution for the problem Israeli Jews have not yet faced, and are obviously avoiding discussion of, but we are not.\n \n \n \n Assuming the approach Israel takes is for an ethnically/racially pure State, consider what OPTIONS THERE ARE TO SOLVE THE \n \"Israeli-Arab Citizen Problem\". These are the \"Options\" that Israel could take to achieve it:\n \n 1) Expel the Israeli-Arabs from Israel, OR\n 2) Deny the Israeli-Arabs the right to vote, and other civil liberties, as well, to attempt to control them, OR\n 3) Offer the Israeli-Arabs an economic reward for moving out of Israel and into some other Nation, OR\n 4) Limit the number of Israeli-Arab children born per Israeli-Arab family, not unlinke the Chinese Communists do to solve their population explosion, OR\n 5) Turn over all land on which the Israeli-Arab Citizens live to the Palestinians that are with Arafat in creating a 2 State solution, OR\n 6) Do absurd things, like killing them, destroying ALL their homes, OR\n and other violent measures. (This is quite absure, and I mention it, ONLY for academic purposes, NOT because I envision it, nor support anything like it.)\n \n \n OK... I think that about covers all the possible alternatives, given your position that exceptions for Israel to do as it wishes with its Citizens need not have any moral basis, other than keeping the State ethnically and racially pure (more or less).\n \n NOW, We need to look at ALL the REASONABLY EXPECTED RESULTS OF IMPLIMENTING each possible alternative listed above.\n \n Let's continue with THE RESULTS OF EACH OPTION IN YOUR SCENARIO. (#'S REFER TO EACH OPTION'S NUMBER, ABOVE.)\n \n Option #1) Expel the Israeli-Arabs from Israel.\n Results: \n A new enemy would be created by Israel!!!\n The \"Recently disposed of Arabs\" for lack of another way to refer to them. So, another round 13 rounds of continuous violence, with NEWLY made enemies that have lost their homes, land, and livelyhood.\n The \"Ethnic Cleansing\" aspect of doing that would cause a huge uproar in the World, and in the U.S. Jews and Gentiles alike, would be agaiinst any kind of solution that resembles ethnic cleansing, and Israel would very likely suffer a loss of economic \n aide from the U.S., and face a World that would be unwilling to support them in any way, INCLUDING all business trasactions.\n Israel would in effect become another Iraq of 11 years ago, facing an embargo from the rest of the World, in return for Ethnic Cleansing. Anti-Semitism would rise World-Wide. Jews World-Wide would blame Israel for that rise in anti-Semitism, and be quite outspoken about it, and withdraw any personal economic support that they might provide to things in Israel.\n \n One last point, if the Israeli-Arabs are expelled when they have a population that is a majority (say in 20 years), or even if they were expelled today, it would result in a terribly bloody Civil War\n inside Israel, and no doublt the Palestinians, and some other Arab groups would join in. (Just a tidbit worthy of mentioning.)\n \n In sum... Option #1 represents nothing less than Ethnic Cleansing, and no one but the most extremist Jews could or would ever support the idea.\n \n So Option #1 is a no go.\n ----------\n Option #2) Deny the Israeli-Arabs the right to vote, and other Civil Liberties, as well, to attempt to control them.\n \n Well, if we know one thing from history, it is that a goernment controlled by a minority NEVER survives. It may take 10, 20, 50, 100, or 500 years, but that government by minority will fall.\n It alsways has, and always will. However, it can be added that a\n Civil War would ensue, and the further in the future that occcurs, the more bloody that War will be. All my previous statements about such a Civil War hold true as well, as mentioned in the Results for Option #1. The response of the World Community \n to a supposedly Democratic State taking away its Citizens Rights to Vote, based on Race, and other Civil Rights, such as removing the right to assemble (assuming they even have such a right in Israel), would be unified in condeming Israel as the New Old South Africa - The Apartheid State. ONly the most radical Jews in Israel would support it, and it is likely that in the even of a looming Civil War, that a majority of Israelis would be quite outspoken about not supporting that policy, and the government would probably collapse, due to any number of causes that would\n result from such an action. And as before, the U.S. would withhold Economic Aide, and no one in the U.S. but the die-hards would even support such a tactic.\n \n In sum, Option #2 is as bad as Option #1. The alternative is out of the question.\n ----------------------\n Option #3) Offer the Israeli-Arabs an economic reward for moving out of Israel and into some other Nation. \n \n Doesn't that sound nice and easy? \n \n Put on your thinkiing Cap, and ask yourself why the Arab-Israelis havent left Israel. Jobs, their Land, their Homes, their heritage, too. Sorry, but this Option falls flat on its face before it even got out of the starting gate. The folks in the MIddle East are not going to take money to move out of Israel and leave their Land, Homes, and Heritage behind, IF ONLY to prove that no amount of money can separate them from their attachment to that land.\n \n So, let give Option #3 a good swift Kick out the door, and move onward.\n ---------------------\n Option #4) Limit the number of Israeli-Arab children born per Israeli-Arab family, not unlinke the Chinese Communists do to solve their population explosion.\n \n An interesting thought, but no more than that...\n Only the MOST extreme Nations would consider doing this for purely political reasons. That aside, no Israeli -Arabs would accept it, and it is would be pretty easy to come up with a variety of ways to fool an Israeli appointed \"Child Birth Monitor\", particularly when your entire Community and all your activities, with the possible exception of employment would keep the Muslim people pretty uninvolved with the Jewish people. If expulsion was used as a punishment for exceeding the limit of the number of children permitted per Arab family, that too, would\n just give Israel one more enemy, and since we are talking about a family, we can assume 4 enemies, plus all of their friends and relatives.\n \n Lastly, and to sum it up.... Option #4 would also be taken as a method of Ethnic Cleansing, racism, and not unlike the idea of Genetic Engineering enforced by the State, to provide for the most prosperous Jew possible. Again, it's an interesting thought, but no more than that. The Chinese society is quite different than the Israeli society and so are the reasons behind such an idea, being used in Israel.\n -----------------------\n Option #5) Turn over all land on which the Israeli-Arab Citizens live to the Palestinians that are with Arafat in creating a 2 State solution. \n \n Well, we already know that this Option ain't ever gonna happen, because EVEN if Israeli-Arabs live on the land inside Israel \"proper\", that Israel ain't gonna give it up, and would never even think of this idea as an Option for their tiny State.\n \n So... with another swift kick Option #5 is thrown out the door, \n as the Jewish Israelis would never permit it.\n -------------------------\n Option #6) Do absurd things, like killing them, destroying ALL their homes.\n \n What can you say about absurd things, but that this was just put in the list for academic reasons, that it's an idea, but would never be put into practice to rid Israel of the Israeli-Arabs. Basically, it is\n nothing less than a declared Jihad, against the Israeli-Arabs, to make an Ethnically and Racially Pure State.\n \n To sum up Option #6, all but the most idiotic Israelis would even consider this as the way they are going to reduce or elimitate Israel's population of Israeli-Arabs. So... Option #6 is also out.\n \n And your fresh out of Options! None of these will work.",

   "============================================\n =========The SOLUTION REDEFINED ===============\n ============================================\n \n (NOTE: Don't even bother debating me about this post, until AFTER you read my analysis of the \"Alernatives for: Ethnic/Racial Purity\" I wrote in the previous post!!!)\n \n First, drop all the XXXX going on today with a 3 part Palestinian State, and move negotiotions to the comcept of a single unified State for the Palestinians, and Refugees.\n \n Return the Occupied Territories without conditions and with reparations for the time the land was occupied.\n \n Work on the basis of a Democratic State with a 50%/50%\n power sharing arrangement with 2 heads of State, adn no decision being made, without join agreement from both Presidents for the next 10 years, after which there would be\n a single President that sets policy, and his opposite that can veto\n that policy for the next 10 years after that.\n \n In 20 years go for a more normal form of government.\n \n Now, with respect to the vote....\n \n Agree on a 50%/50% equl power sharing setup for the next 10 to 20 years in all other parts and positions in government.\n \n Projections say the Israeli Arabs will be a majority in 10 years, and literally dwarf the Israeli Jews in 20 Years.\n \n As part of the 1 State solution, the Palestinian Refugees will be paid substancial reparations without a requirement for paperwork, but with a recognition of some number of people living nearby, that the family did formerly live in some particular area.\n \n Pull out ALL ISraeli Settlers, and turn over ALL the Settlements without delay of conditions to the Palestinian Refugees.\n Agree that all refugees will be financially provided for until they find work.\n \n Agree that schools will no longer be separated by religion, and start bussing kids from their own schools to others, to begin the concept of integration.\n \n Grant all Arabs equal rights, and revoke the Marraige Law.\n \n Agree that Arabs from all of those groups feuding with Israel will be Citizens, except the extremists.\n Jail all extremists. Do NOT expell them, as they will only return to kill people.\n \n The Arabs will turn over all individuals that were in extremist groups, and will work covertly to covertly destroy Hezbohlla, and work with the Israelis in forming a new Jointly run Intelligence Agencey, who's primary mission will be to infiltrate all remaining extraemist cells and groups in the area.\n \n Housing and Living arrangements must be integrated ASAP, because the Arabs will in effect be human shields for the Jews, and reason for extremists to think twice before settting of any bombs.\n \n Integration is key in all respects. Particularly Housing and Schools.\n \n Fund all underfunded institutions that were formerly strictly Arab-Israeli institutions and bring them up to the same good standard that Jewish institutions are, such as the schools.\n \n The governments must both be willing to initially jail Tens of Thousands of exxtremists from both sides.\n \n All police departments will become jointly run and be a 50/50 number of both ethnic groups, On patrol, the groups will remain 50/50 and not divide up by race.\n \n All curent mayors and town councils of \"Jewish\" Cities, townships, and other areas will become immediately reconstituted with a 50/50 membership, and 2 mayors presiding for the next 20 years.\n ==========\n Basically, there would need to be a whole lot of other changes to.\n \n Isreali Jews have one and only one option, live with the Muslims, or get ready to pack up and leave in 20 years.\n =======\n Problems with my solution? XXXX YEAH!\n Plenty of unhappy people for a few years.\n The Jewish naation concept must be forgotten in favor of living together in a country with the Muslims being in the majority.\n \n Eventually, the State will become much like America.\n \n Surprising things happen in 40 years, as I poiintedout in a post that was not spammed on.\n \n Options?\n \n Sorry, but there are no other viable options.",

It would seem most likely that the Israelis will try to expell its Arab citiaens when a separate Palestinian State is established, and they will have one more enemy to deal with.\n \n A very unfortunate mess. The deal I offer is clearly great for the Arabs. However, what the Israelis don't realize is the benefit they would gain when the integrate with Arabs who don't want extremists blowing up bombs.\n \n BTW. 2 nights ago a group of OVER 100,000 Israeli Settlers Marched against the Israeli government (I forgot the reason).\n \n But imagine locking up even 50,000 or 25,000 people! The scope is enourmous.\n \n Anyway, my analysis is that Israel will not survive if the eject their Arab Citizens. \n \n And importantly, as you mentioned people are giving Israel some bad press and not unconditional love and forgiveness.\n \n It's a hard thing to read into a crystal ball with so many factors in motion.",

Or because its nonsense.\n \n it could also be too long and people cant be bothered to read it.\n \n your not even responding to people who have read it.\n \n Ill give you my honest opinion. left wing whimsical idealogy, in other words fantasy.\n\n \n Plotter, lets stay on topic.\n \n You have given 2 ideas.\n \n The 1st idea is not expressed in terms of the growth of the Arab-Israeli population.. It talks about mutual anihillation, but doesn't mention who would threaten destroying Israeli Jews and the Palestinieans. \n \n 1) Some explanation and scenario needs to be setup and described for this to be considered\n \n 2) Something about the growing Arab-Israeli population should be mentioned, unless you envision mutual anhhilation somehow being created before the Israeli-Arabs are a majority.\n \n I can't think of any 3rd party that would threaten to anhillate both the Israeli Jew and the Israeli-Arabs, since both of them are on opposite side of the confilct.\n \n The 2nd option you mentioned is the U.S. not funding Israel, but you haven't put this in context of the growing Israeli-Arab population and the vote related to an Arab-Israeli Majort, nor in the context of any series of actions, or and series of results. It is just an idea out of context of any scenario, as you have not given any scenario for anyone to consider it in.\n \n I know it's possible for the U.S. to stop support of Israel, but I think it unlikely that it would happen, short of some drastic action taken by Israel.\n In any case, you haven't setup a scenario in which the U.S. does stop supporting Israel, and mentioned what happens next, or what happened prior to that, to cause the U.S. to stop funding Israel. I have no idea of what's going on again, as you have presented no sequences of actions, and possible outcomes, nor even mentioned the growing Arab-Israeli population, and how that fits into what your talking about. \n \n On thing to consider, since you would like to think that you live in the real world and no one else does is that even when Israel takes drastic action, as they did when they invaded Lebanon, all the way to the Lebanese Capital, not even a threat of withdrawal of support was given to them by the U.S.\n So, your real world expample needs to give a real world reason for this total withdrawal of support to happen. You might also want to consider if in your real world senario, individuals around the world do not support Israel financially by sending money to Israel, if the U.S dropped support. However, since you claim to know the real world better than I, I leave it to your scenario to fill in the real world details, with some reasoning, and not just a bunch of unrealated out of context non-causal ideas, without any results or consideration of other countries. (I'm sure you knew that already.)\n \n The \"fair fight\" thing sounds interesting, except for Israel's 200 nukes, so I have serious doubts about any country being able to have a fair fight that would go to the extent of invading Israel's boundries to an extent that would be further than the pre-1967 borders. Perhaps a scenario is called for, so that someone reading your post can get an idea of what you're talking about,\n because I'm not certain what is is that your idea has to do with anything, as no context was given.\n \n The only thing I can think of as to what you are saying could occur is that Israel would let the Palestinians multiple to a point at which the Isreali-Arab citizens could take over Israel by having a majority of the vote, and that some series of responses would lead to a Civil War, internally perhaps with a n Arab majority in and out of Israel, but the Israeli's having all the fire-power.\n \n I think that I did consider this option fully and explain it, as well. Perhaps you might want to refer back to my previous post, and explain what it is that I concluded incorrectly. In any case, The fair-fight idea yoiu mentioned is not given in any context, and mentions none of the possible outcomes, nor does it consider that the Israelis have the fire-power, or the nukes if a 3rd power was to strong arm it. IN short, once again, you have given an idea, but provided scenarios, for what would precipitate it, nor what possible actions could happen during it, or what the outcomes could be, nor what the rest of the World might do. \n \n In terms of any concrete options, including \n 1) the U.S. withdrawal of support, \n 2) the mutual annihilation of both party scenario, or \n 3) your original Muslim expulsion idea, \n \n none of the things your mentioned are framed in any context as I've already shown how to logically do. All you've mentioned are a few disparate notions or wishes, without any explanation of what might cause it, or what the reaction in the World would be, or what it the Israeli-Arab population growth has to do with anything you've mentioned, nor what the results would be, nor what might happen ieven in response to the results, if applicaable.\n \n There are no logical causes, nor results given, nor fully explained or considered, and nothing of what this thread is about mentioned in the 1st post, is nentioned either, in any context/scenario.\n \n I consider what you are saying without some logical or even a possilbe context. The obvious place to start is: that in response to the, or in anticipation of the, or the Israelis may not respond to the\n \n Israeli-Arabs being a majority of the citizens in Israel in xx number of years,\n \n and such an such action could happen,\n \n the possible response from the xxxxxxx would / could be xxxxxx\n \n the result of which xxxxxxxxx\n \n Also, the World and the U.S. would likely react in xxxxxxx way at xxxxxx point.\n \n Hopefully. some kind of a logical framework or context in which you could answer the 1st post in this thread can be considered with your explanation.\n \n BTW. If I don't respond within your required timeframe, it could be because I am doing other things. As to the lenght of messages, if they are too long for you, don't bother reading them.\n \n This thread requires thought, and a response that gives the reader a scenario\n with all of the other things mentioned above.",

I'm finally getting the drift of what your point is. \n \n You are speaking on a very high level, when you refer to culture I was speaking on a much lower level.\n \n For example, you are talking about such things as language, clothng, asthetics, a very general agreement and understanding withon the U.S. of right and wrong behavior.\n \n I was speaking on a lower level, for example on the traditions associated with religion, and the things valued by the culture. For example, some cultures highly value obedience (particularly Asian cultures), some cultures highly value education/learning (for example aa number of cultures in the Middle East). Also, included in what I meant by culture are certain symbolic things, usually religions symbolcs or things. For example, for Christians there is the Christian Cross, Christmas Tree, the images associated with the New Testament, while for Jews there is the Star of David, certain fixtures put outside the front door, the Minhora, the Kosher thing with what to eat when and how to prepare it).\n \n In short, the desruction of the dissimilarities that permit that two lower level cultures live together peacefully is a good thing, as it serves its own purpose.\n \n Those higher level differences that keep the Jews and Arabs separate need to be destroyed for the to live together peacefully, and I would support it.\n At this point, they have a separate language, a different enemy, a different social view of the value of males and females.\n \n It's perfectly OK with me if all of that is destroyed. I hope it is. So, I would not disagree with your point, that the higher level of things in culrures are destroyed. I personally have no problem with it and believe it is necessary or them to peacefully coexist. \n \n BTW. Personally, I do not value Traditions. They are unimportant to me. However, I recognize that they are important to others.",
