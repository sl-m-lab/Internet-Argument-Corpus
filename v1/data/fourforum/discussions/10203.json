ALWAYS, I'm greated with a nod of approval that my wishes will soon come true.\n \n It's greater than a Magic 8 Ball.\n \n Of course, like with everyone else...\n Nothing really happens.\n \n But, it gives me a sense of well being.\n \n \n \n The really silly thing is the above method (sans the poking bobbly headed Christ on the noggin) is exactly the summation of the Word of Faith movement's beliefs.\n Or course, they have the magical 'sowing of the seed to prove your faith' (seed always being something of worth like cash or a car given to the pastor) that they are commanded to do before they can reap the harvest and get their heaerts desire (which is also what god wants for you...bible sey so!!1!@)",
