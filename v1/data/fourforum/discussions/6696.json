I'm no child psychologist, but I would guess that this starts to happen around 3 years of age.\n\n true, but i think making moral decisions is something that is learned. for instance, i have a 3 year old son, and a 6 month old daughter. my son is very helpful around the house, because he is encouraged by us, his parents, and rewarded for being helpful. he loves his little sister, but is not always aware of how rough he can be at times and may deliberately do things to hurt her. as parents we teach him what things are ok to do and which are not, and rewards and punishments help reinforce that\n \n basically, he is gradually learning, almost on a case by case basis, what is right and wrong (or more correctly \"ok\" and \"not ok\"). now he knows in some instances what is ok, and some he will eventually get. but the process is actively fed by my input and his mother's\n \n hypothetically, would someone with no interaction with other humans reach a certain age where they become aware of morality? can there be some point where a person can become self cognisant of this without being taught?",

We get rewarded for doing the 'right' thing and punished for doing the 'wrong' things. And consequently we in such a way internalize the rules of dominant morality and rules what is a proper behaviour in the culture we live in.\n Through the process of socialization we learn to behave in such a way to get more rewards (approvals of our behaviour) and less punisment, since it has unpleasant side-effect, so we tend to avoid it.

The motivation behind this act is to minimize female sexual pleasure, if I'm not mistaken (which I could be, please correct me if you know more about this). So again, it's not that sexual pleasure is bad, it's that female pleasure is bad. I'd guess this comes about in attempt by men to limit female promescuity.

By \"exception\" I was expanding on my original idea, that people have pretty much the same ideas about good and evil and just come up with different \"exceptions\" to allow them to not apply them to everyone equally. In regards to your example, everyone believes that mutilating people is bad, but some cultures make an exception because they think it will keep their women from fooling around. If they really thought it was good to mutilate genitals than they would do it to everyone, not just the women. I believe that most instances where it appears at first glance that a culture has a different idea about good and evil turns out in reality to be a case of that culture having a unique exception to the general concept which most if not all cultures share.",
