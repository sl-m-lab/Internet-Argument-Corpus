   "I've recently finished reading a book entitled \"Finding Darwin's God\" by Kenneth Miller, one of today's better known \"theistic evolutionists\". \n \n Between the stark contrasts of Godless evolution and Christianity, his view seems to claim representation of middle ground. I'm not sure just how much variation there is in the theistic evolutionary position - that is, if theistic evolutionists disagree among themselves on any basic points, but I hope to learn that in this discussion.\n \n I'm as passionate as anyone in believing that people have a right to any worldview they wish, and I have no doubt that most theistic evolutionists are sincere in their beliefs, but after reading Miller's book, I find him amazingly short on knowledge of the basics of Christianity. Another theistic evolutionist that I would consider to be sincere could easily have the same ignorance of the Bible as Miller, but the difference is that Miller wrote a book attempting to compare the two (evolution vs. Christianity) and he has no excuse for being largely uninformed on one of the two subjects that he's trying to compare. \n \n Concerning the basic differences in the evolution vs. creation debate, Miller makes this statement at the beginning of chapter 8 - I agree with it - it goes along with what I see on these forums;\n \n \nIronically, when I have publicaly advanced the idea that God is generally compatable with evolution, I find that my agnostic and atheistic colleagues are generally comfortable with such ideas, but many believers are dumbfounded. \n\n \n I believe that's true, and as a \"believer\" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says \"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters\". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be \"with\" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves \"not with\" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be \"with\" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?\n \n Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist. \n \n \n(p 277)I believe much of the problem [a sizeable portion of the general public's lack of acceptance of evolution] lies with atheists in the scientific community who routinely enlist the material findings of evolutionary biology in support of their own philosophical pronouncements. \n\n \n Then there was this one, the most substantial analyzation of philosophy associated with evolution in the whole book;\n \n \n(p 190) [Richard] Lewontin, the evolutionist, is not interested in universal understanding and enlightenment. What he's shooting for is a social order in which right thinking people (like him) will hold the absolute reins of cultural and intellectual power. To Lewontin, direct enlightenment of the public is impossible. We evolutionists simply have to grab hold of power and run things because history tells us we are right. His sentiments confirm the worst fears of the creationists - that evolution isn't really about science, but is instead an ideology of belief, power, and social control. \n\n \n The reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists isn't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments, it's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, Handgun Control, The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless. Miller continues;\n \n \nEvolution is not any of those things. It really is about science, and this means that the question of evolution is fundamentally different from issues of social and moral values. \n\n \n His mistake here, is that evolution isn't any of those social moral things because it shouldn't be. Yet he clearly shows, from Lewontin's words, that it IS. Why doesn't he make any attempt to distinguish ideals from realities? They can be worlds apart, and in this case, they are. We don't make decisions based on how things should be, we make them based on how things ARE. Whether they're personal, day to day decisions, or permanent political decisions. We have to make political decisions about evolution based on how best selling authors like Richard Dawkins USE IT to make themselves \"intellectually fulfilled atheists\". If Miller knows anything about Matthew 12:30, why is this not important to him? If Miller is genuinely disturbed about \"atheists in the scientific community who routinely enlist the material findings of evolutionary biology in support of their own philosophical pronouncements\", why doesn't he distance himself from them, in political matters? He joined them in the recent Dover case, and he has in many others. \n \n There's little question that Miller is an excellent biologist. But from the bottom of page 239, we see an example of his faith;\n \n \nA key doctrine in my own faith is that Jesus was born of a virgin, even though it makes no scientific sense - there is the matter of Jesus's Y-chromosome to account for. But that is the point. Miracles, by definition, do not have to make scientific sense. They are specific acts of God, designed in most cases to get a message across. Their very rarity is what makes them remarkable.\n \n An atheist, of course, will argue that miracles are bogus and are stitched together from the needs and desires of human imagination. Maybe so. To a believer, miracles are more than \"violations of the laws of nature,\" as they were described by David Hume. They reflect a greater reality, a spiritual reality, and they occur in a context that makes religious, not scientific, sense. To the nonbeliever, there is no spiritual reality, and hence there are no miracles. To a person of faith, miracles display the greater purposes of God, giving them a meaning that transcends physical reality.\n \n If this is true, why shouldn't we allow that the creation of our species was a miracle? Or why not agree that the sudden explosion of life in the Cambrian era might have been a miracle? Both might have been. In 1900, we could easily have said that the sun's fire was a miracle. Unable to explain the biological basis of immunity, we could have chalked that up to God, too. And for good measure we could have told our students that the interior heat of the earth might be the work of the devil.\n \n We are now far enough along in the development of science to appreciate that its track record suggests that ultimately it will find natural causes for natural phenomena. \n\n \n But wait a minute! Hasn't science found that it's scientifically impossible for Jesus to be born of a virgin - no Y-chromosome? Why is he willing to forfeit science and accept the Bible in that regard, and forfeit the Bible in so many other respects? Why is it okay for him to accept the virgin birth of Christ, and riducule anyone who believes in the creation of the first man, Adam? If God could handle the Y-chromosome, couldn't God also handle creating the first, fully formed man? He calls Adam \"fictional\" on page 5. It becomes more and more clear why atheists are comfortable with theistic evolution. If there was no Adam, there was no original sin, and no genealogy as described in the book of Genesis, only monkeys. Except for his amazing exception to science in the virgin birth of Jesus, he seems to allow evolutionistic pronouncements to have priority over Biblical statements. Then ALL the basics of Christianity, the nature of God and central New Testament teachings, including the way the sinner Adam (one man)and the Savior Jesus (one man) are linked together in Romans 5, 16-18, are trivialized just the way atheists love. No wonder they're so comfortable with theistic evolution!\n \n On the bottom of page 235, Miller's comment about \"just about any preacher I have had the patience to listen too.....\" speaks volumes - his cluelessness about original sin and many other things about Christianity shows he hasn't had patience to listen to too many. But patience doesn't seem to be a factor when it comes to his enthusiasm for Darwin's works. He finishes the book with \"What kind of God do I believe in? The answer is in these words. I believe in Darwin's God.\" \n \n Sorry folks. It's going to take more than a herd of angry atheists to convince me that he's anything but a phony. I hope this thread gets some civilized responses.",

There's really no line drawn by that verse.\n \n \n The reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists isn't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments, it's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, Handgun Control, The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless. Miller continues;\n\n \n Because the NY Times, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, and Handgun Control are all atheist-lead and anti-Christianity. Yeah.\n \n \n Yet he clearly shows, from Lewontin's words, that it IS.\n\n \n He clearly shows that Lewontin thinks it is. Lewontin also thinks there's no such thing as God. That doesn't make him right.\n \n \n We don't make decisions based on how things should be, we make them based on how things ARE.\n\n \n That's certainly not the way most governments work.\n \n \n Whether they're personal, day to day decisions, or permanent political decisions. We have to make political decisions about evolution based on how best selling authors like Richard Dawkins USE IT to make themselves \"intellectually fulfilled atheists\".\n\n \n WHAT? Does this work both ways? Do we also have to make political decisions about religion based on how celebrity Christians like Fred Phelps use it to bash homosexuality?\n \n \n If Miller knows anything about Matthew 12:30, why is this not important to him? If Miller is genuinely disturbed about \"atheists in the scientific community who routinely enlist the material findings of evolutionary biology in support of their own philosophical pronouncements\", why doesn't he distance himself from them, in political matters? He joined them in the recent Dover case, and he has in many others.\n\n \n 1.) The Dover Case had nothing to do with atheism.\n 2.) He HAS distanced himself from \"them.\" I've already shown you the blog by PZ Meyers in which Miller is attacked for straying away from his and Dawkins's atheist agendas.\n \n \n But wait a minute! Hasn't science found that it's scientifically impossible for Jesus to be born of a virgin - no Y-chromosome? Why is he willing to forfeit science and accept the Bible in that regard, and forfeit the Bible in so many other respects?\n\n \n You've overlooked what really isn't much of a contradiction. There's evidence against a World Flood, and there's no evidence for it. All God had to do create Jesus was poof him into Mary's womb. If the Great Flood really did occur, that means God poofed all the evidence of it away and poofed in its place evidence that contradicts it.\n \n \n If God could handle the Y-chromosome, couldn't God also handle creating the first, fully formed man?\n\n \n It certainly could; but again, this turns God into a deceiver who actually uses scientific evidence to trick people.\n \n \n He calls Adam \"fictional\" on page 5. It becomes more and more clear why atheists are comfortable with theistic evolution. If there was no Adam, there was no original sin, and no genealogy as described in the book of Genesis, only monkeys.\n\n \n Because the whole point of disproving Adam is to eliminate the idea of personal sin. Yep, that's exactly why I've always disliked the Adam and Eve tale. Never mind the colossus of contradictory evidence-it's all about making sure that vile idea of personal sin goes up in smoke with the fable itself.\n \n \n Except for his amazing exception to science in the virgin birth of Jesus, he seems to allow evolutionistic pronouncements to have priority over Biblical statements. Then ALL the basics of Christianity, the nature of God and central New Testament teachings, including the way the sinner Adam (one man)and the Savior Jesus (one man) are linked together in Romans 5, 16-18, are trivialized just the way atheists love. No wonder they're so comfortable with theistic evolution!\n\n \n Please point out where Miller says he rejects the idea of Personal Sin. Happy quote mining.\n \n \n On the bottom of page 235, Miller's comment about \"just about any preacher I have had the patience to listen too.....\" speaks volumes - his cluelessness about original sin and many other things about Christianity shows he hasn't had patience to listen to too many.\n\n \n He doesn't even use the words personal sin. You can't possibly know that he rejects it.\n \n \n Sorry folks. It's going to take more than a herd of angry atheists to convince me that he's anything but a phony. I hope this thread gets some civilized responses.\n\n \n Fine. Consider him a phony. Was John Paul II also a phony?",

   "... here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says \"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters\".\n\n But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his?\n \n Regarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. Miller clearly continues with \"philosophical pronouncements\" that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond \"atheistic philosophical pronouncements.\"\n \n \nThe reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists isn't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments, it's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, Handgun Control, The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless.\n\n Good, I was afraid we'd get through a post without mentioning the evil conspiracy. But let's clear something up: You voluntarily started the citation after Lewontin's quote, preventing those without the book from seeing what Lewontin actually said. Here's what you left out, from the top of page 190: \n [Philip] Johnson's willingness to dismiss scientific evidence confirms Lewontin's fear that someone \"who could believe in a God could believe in anything.\" Anything clearly includes the nonsense of creationism, which one might think Lewontin would want to counter by a vigorous exposure to the sunlight of truth. But he writes that \"it is not the truth that makes you free. It is your possession of the power to discover the truth.\" [bold added]\nGod forbid we allow people the power to discover the truth! That would just be too much, wouldn't it marc? Let's shove the Bible in their faces and make sure they know it's the only source of information...\n \n \nHis mistake here, is that evolution isn't any of those social moral things because it shouldn't be. Yet he clearly shows, from Lewontin's words, that it IS.\n\n No, Miller has it right when he says evolution really isn't any of those things. Miller's mistake is that he misinterprets Lewontin. Lewontin is saying to give people the power to discover truth by providing the evidence and removing the a priori assumptions about the world. Notice that Lewontin is talking about being \"free,\" not correct.\n \n \nWe have to make political decisions about evolution based on how best selling authors like Richard Dawkins USE IT to make themselves \"intellectually fulfilled atheists\".\n\n We have to, marc says. We also have to ignore Miller's book, right? Get real. Put a hold on your whiny diatribe and focus on the book.\n \n \nIf Miller is genuinely disturbed about \"atheists in the scientific community who routinely enlist the material findings of evolutionary biology in support of their own philosophical pronouncements\", why doesn't he distance himself from them, in political matters? He joined them in the recent Dover case, and he has in many others. \n\n He did distance himself from them by writing the book you allegedly just read. And unless you can show me evidence that many of the Kitzmiller plaintiff's witnesses use evolutionary theory to promote their own atheistic \"philosophical pronouncements,\" I'm comfortable with believing that you are once again full of XXXX. For crying out loud, many of the plaintiffs were Christians!\n \n \nThere's little question that Miller is an excellent biologist. But from the bottom of page 239, we see an example of his faith;\n \n [snip]\n \n But wait a minute! Hasn't science found that it's scientifically impossible for Jesus to be born of a virgin - no Y-chromosome? Why is he willing to forfeit science and accept the Bible in that regard, and forfeit the Bible in so many other respects?\n\n I won't try to explain this, but anybody who has the book can read pages 240-243 to see what marc is once again omitting. Miller continues by explaining that he feels God's interactions with the world are few and far between because they are strategically placed, and he puts it in a context than any believer has surely heard, believed, and repeated dozens of times: We don't see huge Godly magic tricks because \"God doesn't work that way.\" When I ask for an obvious sign, like my keyboard floating before my eyes, and it doesn't happen, the excuse I hear is that \"God doesn't work that way.\" Now, all of a sudden, marc has a problem with that explanation. Go figure.\n \n \nIf God could handle the Y-chromosome, couldn't God also handle creating the first, fully formed man?\n\n Miller isn't saying that God couldn't, he's saying that God didn't. In fact, he says so explicitly on page 290:If he so chose, the God whose presence is taught by most Western religious could have fashioned anything, ourselves included, ex nihilo, from his wish alone. In our childhood as a species, that might have been the only way in which we could imagine the fulfillment of His will. But we've grown up, and something remarkable has happened -- we have begun to understand the physical basis of life itself.\nIn other words, marc, his understanding isn't as undeveloped and limited as yours.\n \n \nOn the bottom of page 235, Miller's comment about \"just about any preacher I have had the patience to listen too.....\" speaks volumes - his cluelessness about original sin and many other things about Christianity shows he hasn't had patience to listen to too many.\n\n Maybe because he's Catholic and is used to priests instead of fundie sects led by preachers?\n \n \nSorry folks. It's going to take more than a herd of angry atheists to convince me that he's anything but a phony.\n\n So you think he's really an atheist? No, you disagree with him on technicalities of your religion, which you'd do with billions of other Christians. Are they all phonies, too?\n \n ETA: Wow, Collin had some damn good points, especially PZ's chiding and JPII. Well done, Collin.",

I see you have failed to post on the thread asking how evolution is atheistic despite the numerous faithful and religions that accept evolution. \n \n Plus you are denying the natural world of God, which in certain angle is blasphemy.",

   "Does this mean it is un-Christian not to refuse to \"be with\" atheists and agnostics, Jews and Muslims, or Hindus and Native Americans in the work place? There's really no line drawn by that verse. \n\n \n You'd have to have a basic knowledge of the entire Bible to understand that it doesn't mean physically \"with\", whether in the workplace, or any place in our daily routines. Especially in these days where fuzzy middle ground between Biblical Christianity and absolute atheism grows and grows, Matthew 12:30 has to do with one's perception and recoginition of life's purpose, the use of moral discernment, the understanding of matters which require us to distinguish between good and bad, true and false, right and wrong. It's un-Christian to ignore Romans, 5: 16-18, for example, when writing a book attempting to \"search for common ground\" between God and evolution. \n \n \n \n \nHe clearly shows that Lewontin thinks it is. Lewontin also thinks there's no such thing as God. That doesn't make him right. \n\n \n What Lewontin thinks is irrelevent. If Lewontin, a well known evolutionist, and many other well known evolutionists ARE USING evolution as a weapon against Christianity and for atheism, the evolution IS RELATED TO atheism. \n \n \n \nThat's certainly not the way most governments work. \n\n \n I agree. Most governments are too big and too intrusive, and government tends to decide what \"should be\", representing itself more than the people it is supposed to represent.\n \n \n \nWHAT? Does this work both ways? Do we also have to make political decisions about religion based on how celebrity Christians like Fred Phelps use it to bash homosexuality? \n\n \n No, as more and more ACLU inspired court decisions happen, it grows increasingly one way. When church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. \n \n \n \n \n1.) The Dover Case had nothing to do with atheism.\n\n \n It was a media circus, and had plenty to do with the establishment clause of the first amendment. \n \n \n2.) He HAS distanced himself from \"them.\" I've already shown you the blog by PZ Meyers in which Miller is attacked for straying away from his and Dawkins's atheist agendas. \n\n \n That one blog is a very lopsided comparison to the many examples of Miller siding with them in this book. \n \n \n \nYou've overlooked what really isn't much of a contradiction. There's evidence against a World Flood, and there's no evidence for it.\n\n \n That's the atheist worldview. If you check creationist websites, you find claims of evidence for the flood, with no evidence against it. Is it completely automatic that theistic evolution accepts the atheist position? \n \n \nAll God had to do create Jesus was poof him into Mary's womb. If the Great Flood really did occur, that means God poofed all the evidence of it away and poofed in its place evidence that contradicts it. \n\n \n \n Does the theistic evolutionist position agree with atheism because of the number of \"poofs\"? It's too bad theistic evolution has no church - no doctrine, etc. I'd like to know what criteria they have for determining what miracles they choose to accept. Is it a \"poof\" count? One poof, and theistic evolutionists are okay with creationists, but multiple poofs put them shoulder to shoulder with atheists? \n \n \n \nIt certainly could; but again, this turns God into a deceiver who actually uses scientific evidence to trick people. \n\n \n God does not require us to accept scientific \"evidence\" that is often put fourth by false teachers that he warned us about. \n \n \n \n \nBecause the whole point of disproving Adam is to eliminate the idea of personal sin. Yep, that's exactly why I've always disliked the Adam and Eve tale. Never mind the colossus of contradictory evidence-it's all about making sure that vile idea of personal sin goes up in smoke with the fable itself. \n\n \n That's it, you've got it. Atheism doesn't like the idea of original sin, so came the intense search for \"contradictory evidence\" in the Adam and Eve description. Theistic evolutionists seem okay with it. \n \n \n \n \nPlease point out where Miller says he rejects the idea of Personal Sin. Happy quote mining.\n\n \n Where do you get the word \"personal\"? The word is \"original\". The book doesn't address it at all, this book written by a \"Christian\" who claims to be attempting to find common ground between God and evolution.\n \n \n \nHe doesn't even use the words personal sin. \n\n \n Neither do I - you pulled the word \"personal\" out of thin air. He doesn't use the words \"original sin\" anywhere that I noticed. The word \"sin\" doesn't appear in the index. He did use it a time or two, but not in any kind of deep, meaningful way. It's a word that is central in Christianity. \n \n \nYou can't possibly know that he rejects it.\n\n \n If you had a book by a creationist who claimed to compare evolution and Christianity, and spent almost the entire book searching scripture and ignoring evolution, would you come to the conclusion that he rejects evolution? \n \n \n \nFine. Consider him a phony. Was John Paul II also a phony?\n\n \n Did John Paul II claim the Adam and Eve description to be a fairy tale? Vatican approved link please.",

   "I honestly believe that is the only reason you don't at least partially accept evolution.\n\n No, the reason is because the Bible tells him that the Bible has all the answers and is never wrong but doesn't describe evolution.\n \n \nGood questions. I agree that this logic is somewhat flawed (unless quote mined). God could have made Adam and Eve. He could then have planted evidence that life evolved to this point. The miracle could have happened, too, in much the same way.\n\n See my post above, Hi. marc ignores fundamentals of Miller's beliefs that he clearly spells out in trying to push his anti-Miller argument.\n \n \nA phony what?

   "But Miller is with Jesus (and by extension, you): he says that God exists and that Christianity is true. Or, if you insist that he's against you, you're left with this conundrum: You call Miller and theistic evolutionists incorrect, and he calls you and anti-evolutionists incorrect; why is your position any more logical than his? \n\n \n Because his, as a Christian, doesn't follow the Christian Bible to anywhere near the extent that mine does.\n \n \nRegarding your citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, you omit the remainder of the paragraph. Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine. \n\n \n \"Quote mine\" - looks like that will be a common acusation here. If I keep things concise and readable, I'm quote mining. That quote wasn't about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, it was about atheists being comfortable with theistic evolution, far more than \"believers\" (creationists) \n \n \n \n Miller clearly continues with \"philosophical pronouncements\" that many atheists do not forward. Over the following three paragraphs, he examines a single philosophical insinuation -- not a plethora of them -- and then moves beyond \"atheistic philosophical pronouncements.\" \n\n \n And that didn't have a thing to do with my point. \n \n \n \nGood, I was afraid we'd get through a post without mentioning the evil conspiracy. But let's clear something up: You voluntarily started the citation after Lewontin's quote, preventing those without the book from seeing what Lewontin actually said. Here's what you left out, from the top of page 190: \n God forbid we allow people the power to discover the truth! That would just be too much, wouldn't it marc? Let's shove the Bible in their faces and make sure they know it's the only source of information...\n\n \n Again, it was irrelevent to my point. Atheists believe the only source of truth is secular - it goes without saying. \n \n \n \n \nNo, Miller has it right when he says evolution really isn't any of those things. Miller's mistake is that he misinterprets Lewontin. Lewontin is saying to give people the power to discover truth by providing the evidence and removing the a priori assumptions about the world. Notice that Lewontin is talking about being \"free,\" not correct. \n\n \n No, Lewontin didn't say to give people the power to discover the truth, he's saying to give elites like him the authority to point them to \"correct\" sources of truth. Read note #47 for chapter 6. Miller didn't misinterpret him at all. In note #47, Lewontin even mentioned the NY Times!\n \n \n \nWe have to, marc says. \n\n \n Because there are no ACLU lawsuits when Dawkin's book is required reading in public schools. We have to more and more, as atheism is established. \n \n \n We also have to ignore Miller's book, right? Get real. Put a hold on your whiny diatribe and focus on the book. \n\n \n It's a deal, if you'll put a hold on lecturing me about reading comprension as you ignore very relevant notes in the rear of the book. \n \n \n \nHe did distance himself from them by writing the book you allegedly just read. \n\n \n The one where he bragged about defeating Henry Morris, a Christian? (pp 172, 173)\n \n \n And unless you can show me evidence that many of the Kitzmiller plaintiff's witnesses use evolutionary theory to promote their own atheistic \"philosophical pronouncements,\" I'm comfortable with believing that you are once again full of XXXX. For crying out loud, many of the plaintiffs were Christians!\n\n \n Sure they were, Christians are always opposing Christianity! All they have to do is claim to be a Christian, and there's no way they could be a false teacher!\n \n \n \nI won't try to explain this, but anybody who has the book can read pages 240-243 to see what marc is once again omitting. Miller continues by explaining that he feels God's interactions with the world are few and far between because they are strategically placed, and he puts it in a context than any believer has surely heard, believed, and repeated dozens of times: We don't see huge Godly magic tricks because \"God doesn't work that way.\" When I ask for an obvious sign, like my keyboard floating before my eyes, and it doesn't happen, the excuse I hear is that \"God doesn't work that way.\" Now, all of a sudden, marc has a problem with that explanation. Go figure. \n\n \n And that's all irrelevent, because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today, not what happened concerning creation. His feelings about God's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible. \n \n \n \n \nMiller isn't saying that God couldn't, he's saying that God didn't. In fact, he says so explicitly on page 290:In other words, marc, his understanding isn't as undeveloped and limited as yours. \n\n \n Even though the Bible says God did. His understanding of the Bible is very undeveloped and limited. \n \n \n \nMaybe because he's Catholic and is used to priests instead of fundie sects led by preachers?\n\n \n So you're implying that when he made his snide little comment about \"preachers\", he wasn't referring to priests? I've seen it all now. :xbanghead \n \n \n \nSo you think he's really an atheist? No, you disagree with him on technicalities of your religion, which you'd do with billions of other Christians. Are they all phonies, too? \n\n \n As I said, I hope to learn if all theistic evolution does not believe in original sin. I'd like to know if all Catholics believe the creation story is nothing but a fairy tale.",

Either way, this claim of marc's clearly defeats itself.\n \n \nWhen church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined.\n\n For those who missed it, marc doesn't understand that secularism isn't the same thing as atheism.

Right-o, marc. (I suspect you haven't even read the blog entry in question; I'd be surprised if you've read more than a paragraph of PZ's blog.. ever.)\n \n \nThat's the atheist worldview. If you check creationist websites, you find claims of evidence for the flood, with no evidence against it.\n\n Bogus claims of evidence for the flood, yes. Check it out yourself. And why would creationist websites present evidence against the flood?\n Of course, you could always check in with the ASA, a Christian organization, about their thoughts on the flood. But then, I guess you'd just call those God-worshipping Bible readers a bunch of evil atheists, wouldn't you?\n \n \nIt's too bad theistic evolution has no church - no doctrine, etc.\n\n It's too bad you're equating theistic evolution with an entire religion. It makes you look even more clueless. It's like whining that there's no specific church for Noachian flood believers.\n \n \nGod does not require us to accept scientific \"evidence\" that is often put fourth by false teachers that he warned us about.\n\n Good show on putting the word evidence in quotes.

Shame on you, marc, for your quote mine.\n\n \"Quote mine\" - looks like that will be a common acusation here. If I keep things concise and readable, I'm quote mining. That quote wasn't about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts, it was about atheists being comfortable with theistic evolution, far more than \"believers\" (creationists)\n\n Yeesh. Even when I spell it out, he still can't keep it straight.\n No, marc, you're looking at the wrong quote. Try reading what I write.\n Yes, you can expect accusations of quote mining to be common when you commonly quote mine. Say, do you think these two things could possibly be related?\n \"Concise and readable\" takes a backseat to accurate. As I said, Miller overemphasizes views outside the mainstream of atheism and tries to paint all of atheism with the same brush. In fact, he picks a single atheist to spend three paragraphs on, then moves past his exaggerated claim. And with good reason.\n \n \nAnd that didn't have a thing to do with my point.\n\n marc's impeccable reading comprehension strikes again. marc thinks I was responding to a different point, despite the clear explanation of his \"citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts.\"\n I figure it's his latest attempt at a dodge. Ignorance and incomprehensible babbling has gotten old to him, apparently.\n \n \nAgain, it was irrelevent to my point. Atheists believe the only source of truth is secular - it goes without saying.\n\n Considering atheists don't believe in the supernatural, there's nothing else left. Now tell me how your truism actually means anything.\n Lewontin did not say to forbid access to the Bible or other texts. You simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can. See, if you had just quoted Lewontin instead of trying to censor his words, maybe you would have understood. ... Then again, probably not. I keep forgetting that your Persecution switch is fused in the \"on\" position.\n \n \nNo, Lewontin didn't say to give people the power to discover the truth, he's saying to give elites like him the authority to point them to \"correct\" sources of truth. Read note #47 for chapter 6. Miller didn't misinterpret him at all. In note #47, Lewontin even mentioned the NY Times!\n\n Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don't have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...\n If Miller truly does understand Lewontin's point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?\n The best case you'll ever be able to make regarding Lewontin's claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective. You claim that your path to truth is the most effective. Once again, we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone.\n \n \nBecause there are no ACLU lawsuits when Dawkin's book is required reading in public schools. We have to more and more, as atheism is established.\n\n Which Dawkins books that promote atheism (and by atheism, I mean atheism, not evolution) are required reading in public schools? Cite specific instances and include evidence that the ACLU rejected the cases.\n \n \nIt's a deal, if you'll put a hold on lecturing me about reading comprension as you ignore very relevant notes in the rear of the book.\n\n This coming from the person who omitted so much that I had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times? No thanks, I'd rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension.\n \n \nThe one where he bragged about defeating Henry Morris, a Christian?\n\n Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism?

All they have to do is claim to be a Christian, and there's no way they could be a false teacher!\n\n Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this \"power,\" too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.\n And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.\n \n \nAnd that's all irrelevent, because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today, not what happened concerning creation.

   "To me, \"Theistic evolutionists\" is an extreme contradiction. \n\n \n Of course it is, and a dangerous one at that. When God is integretaed into the evolutionary philosophy reducing the book of Genesis to an \"allegory\", it misrepresents the nature of God as explained in the rest of the Bible, cheapens all Biblical teachings, and creates uncertaintinty in the method for finding God.\n \n \n I mean, either you have faith that the Bible is the true word of God or you don't. \n\n \n Matthew 12 :30 indicates two choices concerning the acceptance of Jesus, and other parts of the Bible deal with two choices regarding other things. It is easy to see today; with all the different political opinions in U.S. politics, it still basically boils down to Democrat vs. Republican. Conflicts almost always involve two opposing forces, and any fuzzy middle ground can't help but leaning one way or the other. If we wonder which way theistic evolution leans politically, all we have to do is see who falls all over themselves to defend it, don't we? :) \n \n \n \n I don't see how you can pick and choose what you care to believe out of the Bible. How can one believe in the miracle of Jesus' birth and resurrection yet not believe that Adam and Eve were real people? I find it a contradiction to somehow believe that God is great enough to create the universe, yet He somehow needed billions of years to do so. \n\n \n How about this one, from page 56 in Millers book;\n \n \nIt is high time that we grew up and left the Garden. We are indeed Eden's children, yet it is time to place Genesis alongside the geocentric myth in the basket of stories that once, in a world of intellectual naivete, made helpful sense. As we walk through the gates, aware of the dazzling richness of the genuine biological world, there might even be a smile on the Creator's face - that at long last His creatures have learned enough to understand His world as it truly is. \n\n \n It puts a \"smile on God's face\" for us to reject the book of Genesis? That God smiles because maybe he wasn't necessary in more and more peoples minds? Is it no wonder atheists love this guy? Is it no wonder the Bible warns us about false teachers?\n \n \n If God is all-powerful, then His words should be all that's needed. To me, the world is proof that God is all-powerful. The beauty and complexity is just staggering. (if all the DNA in the human body was stretched out it would circle the moon 6,000 times!)\n \n http://www.ba-education.demon.co.uk/for/science/dna.html\n\n \n So much about complexity on earth has been discovered since Darwin, yet comparatively little more complexity has been discovered in all the dead rock planets all around us. But Darwinism will always be the faithful beginning point for atheism, just as the Bible is for us. \n \n \nChristanity is not synonymous with religion or a belief in a diety. \n\n \n And evolution isn't atheistic!! :p Do you ever wonder how these peoples' minds work, SS????",

   "Of course it is, and a dangerous one at that. When God is integretaed into the evolutionary philosophy reducing the book of Genesis to an \"allegory\", it misrepresents the nature of God as explained in the rest of the Bible, cheapens all Biblical teachings, and creates uncertaintinty in the method for finding God.\n\n Of course, that is only true for your interpretation; actual theistic evolutionists have a different view.\n Also, I noticed you haven't posted on the theistic evolution thread. Why don't you defend your claims that evolution is atheistic and/or that it is only for destroying religious views.\n \nIt puts a \"smile on God's face\" for us to reject the book of Genesis? That God smiles because maybe he wasn't necessary in more and more peoples minds? Is it no wonder atheists love this guy? Is it no wonder the Bible warns us about false teachers?\n\n Atheists disagree with theists about religion, but they don't tend to care too much. When religious people claim that the bible takes precedence over the facts, atheists take notice.\n \nSo much about complexity on earth has been discovered since Darwin, yet comparatively little more complexity has been discovered in all the dead rock planets all around us. \n\n Are you talking about living things? Hopefully it won't suprise you to learn that there is no life on other planets, so that factor of \"complexity\" (please define) isn't present on those.\n \nBut Darwinism will always be the faithful beginning point for atheism, just as the Bible is for us. \n\n Religion= faith in a deity or deities (rough definition)\n Atheism= lack of religion/deities\n Therefore, atheism= lack of faith\n \n There is no \"faithful\" beginning point of atheism.\n Atheism is based on observations of the world around us. Once again, I would like to ask you to answer how a benevolent, omnipotent god can exist in a universe with as many problems as this one. Wouldn't the problems have been fixed by now?\n \nAnd evolution isn't atheistic!! :p Do you ever wonder how these peoples' minds work, SS????\n\n Evolution does not assume the existance/non-existance of a deity.

   "The concept of original sin is an interesting one, as it allows preachers and priests to set themselves up with simple moral authority. If original sin is absent, why is a priest any better than the average person? Only when a priest/preacher can say that he is closer to God, and that he has been saved can he cast doom and fire upon those unconverted. Basically it makes people feel guilty, and when people feel guilty they will allow themselves to be lead by the nose in order to pay off this guilt. It's a very clever psychological device.\n \n Also it's interesting to note that there is an argument here about upholding the exact translation of the bible. Given that the Bible has myriad forms, and that the contents of the new Testament were not agreed upon until 1545 at the council of Trent (wikipedia) it seems a bit daft to be relying on it as the pure unadulterated word of God, given that men were arguing over which bits to include for 1500 years.....",

   "I want to know what Marc thinks the differences between Agnosticism and Atheism are.\n\n \n Let's have a look at dictionary.com then;\n \n \nagnostic;\n 1. a person who holds that the existence of the ultimate cause, as God, and the essential nature of things are unknown and unknowable, or that human knowledge is limited to experience. \n 2. a person who denies or doubts the possibility of ultimate knowledge in some area of study. \n -adjective 3. of or pertaining to agnostics or agnosticism. \n 4. asserting the uncertainty of all claims to knowledge. \n \n \n \n One who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God. \n One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism. One who is doubtful or noncommittal about something. \n \n adj. \n Relating to or being an agnostic. \n Doubtful or noncommittal: \"Though I am agnostic on what terms to use, I have no doubt that human infants come with an enormous 'acquisitiveness' for discovering patterns\" (William H. Calvin). \n \n \n [a-1 + Gnostic.]\n ag\u00b7nosti\u00b7cal\u00b7ly adv. \n Word History: An agnostic does not deny the existence of God and heaven but holds that one cannot know for certain whether or not they exist. The term agnostic was fittingly coined by the 19th-century British scientist Thomas H. Huxley, who believed that only material phenomena were objects of exact knowledge. He made up the word from the prefix a-, meaning \"without, not,\" as in amoral, and the noun Gnostic. Gnostic is related to the Greek word gnsis, \"knowledge,\" which was used by early Christian writers to mean \"higher, esoteric knowledge of spiritual things\" hence, Gnostic referred to those with such knowledge. In coining the term agnostic, Huxley was considering as \"Gnostics\" a group of his fellow intellectuals\"ists,\" as he called themwho had eagerly embraced various doctrines or theories that explained the world to their satisfaction. Because he was a \"man without a rag of a label to cover himself with,\" Huxley coined the term agnostic for himself, its first published use being in 1870. \n \n atheist;\n a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings. \n \n \n -Synonyms Atheist, agnostic, infidel, skeptic refer to persons not inclined toward religious belief or a particular form of religious belief. An atheist is one who denies the existence of a deity or of divine beings. An agnostic is one who believes it impossible to know anything about God or about the creation of the universe and refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine. Infidel means an unbeliever, especially a nonbeliever in Islam or Christianity. A skeptic doubts and is critical of all accepted doctrines and creeds. \n\n \n There should be more of a difference between them than there is. Going by the phrases that I highlighted in the above quotes from dictionary.com, an agnostic would be \"noncommittal\" - we see several on these forums who claim to be agnostic that commit themselves to declaring the Bible is mythology, etc. Huxley himself didn't seem very noncommittal. \n \n If an agnostic \"refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine\" yet commits to atheistic doctrine, (as we see all the time) then the difference between them is practically indistinguishable. As we can see, dictionary.com refers to them as synonyms.",

   "Let's take a look at the sentence again:He wasn't separating the idea because the idea is common. The label of \"preacher\" is not. \n\n \n His only source of the idea was \"preachers\". He wasn't separating preachers and priests either, because it was a common idea among both of them. \n \n \n \nAs pandion points out, you almost have a point here. The question is whether or not Miller's beliefs are representative of those of mainstream Catholicism. Can you find damning inconsistencies between Miller's religious beliefs and mainstream Catholic beliefs? \n\n \n Yes. \n \n \nVIII. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS\n The most important general conclusions to be noted are as follows:- \n \n The origin of life is unknown to science. \n The origin of the main organic types and their principal subdivisions are likewise unknown to science. \n There is no evidence in favour of an ascending evolution of organic forms. \n There is no trace of even a merely probable argument in favour of the animal origin of man. The earliest human fossils and the most ancient traces of culture refer to a true Homo sapiens as we know him today. \n Most of the so-called systematic species and genera were certainly not created as such, but originated by a process of either gradual or saltatory evolution. Changes which extend beyond the range of variation observed in the human species have thus far not been strictly demonstrated, either experimentally or historically. \n There is very little known as to the causes of evolution. The greatest difficulty is to explain the origin and constancy of \"new\" characters and the teleology of the process. Darwin's \"natural selection\" is a negative factor only. The moulding influence of the environment cannot be doubted; but at present we are unable to ascertain how far that influence may extend. Lamarck's \"inheritance of acquired characters\" is not yet exactly proved, nor is it evident that really new forms can arise by \"mutation\". In our opinion the principle of \"Mendelian segregation\", together with Darwin's natural selection and the moulding influence of environment, will probably be some of the chief constituents of future evolutionary theories. \n\n \n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05655a.htm\n \n \n \nLet's presume that I sunk time into finding said source. You'd just yell loudly that whatever organization I found is really a secret bunch of evil, anti-Christian atheist sympathizers who can't be regarded as a reliable source, as evidenced by nothing but your whim. I only call you a liar without explanation when you've repeated the same lie so many times that my explaining it for the umpteenth time is a waste of time: you ignore it every time, and everyone else has read it already. \n\n \n You've come nowhere near showing Miller to be a \"mainstream Catholic\", or showing a Catholic endorsement of his book. Accepted Catholic sources are easily recognized. \"New Advent\" is one of them. \n \n \nYou instead want a free pass to call Miller a liar merely because the technicalities of his beliefs differ from yours. \n\n \n The atheistic belief that there was no fully formed first man is more than just a technicality.\n \n \n Gee, how do you think you fellas came up with all those Protestant sects like yours anyway, marc?\n\n \n Technicalities, nothing nearly as drastic as some of Miller's harmony with atheism.",

Seriously, marc, is that the best you can do? The Catholic Encyclopedia is from the 1910s. That's pathetic. Here's some updated information:\"In his encyclical Humani Generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of certain fixed points....Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines. The convergence in the results of these independent studies -- which was neither planned nor sought -- constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory.\"\n\n Pope John Paul II, Message to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Evolution, 22 Oct 1996\"Cosmogony and cosmology have always aroused great interest among peoples and religions. The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer. The Sacred Book likewise wishes to tell men that the world was not created as the seat of the gods, as was taught by other cosmogonies and cosmologies, but was rather created for the service of man and the glory of God. Any other teaching about the origin and make-up of the universe is alien to the intentions of the Bible, which does not wish to teach how heaven was made but how one goes to heaven.\"\nPope John Paul II, \"Cosmology and Fundamental Physics,\" 03 Oct 1981Looks pretty Miller-like to me.\n \n See, now you can call JPII a phony, too, but that won't change the fact that he was the pope, and that Catholics hold the pope to be infallible.\n \n \nYou've come nowhere near showing Miller to be a \"mainstream Catholic\", or showing a Catholic endorsement of his book. Accepted Catholic sources are easily recognized. \"New Advent\" is one of them. \n\n See above. Your source is damn near a century old. Modern Catholicism harmonizes with Miller's views. \n \n \nThe atheistic belief that there was no fully formed first man is more than just a technicality.\n\n So now Catholics are atheists...

Weren't you paying attention?\n \nIf it was about evolution, I'd believe them!\nBut then, you declare you belief in mythology.[/quote]\n \nNo it is not, the truth value of that statement can be determined.\nIndeed it can. According to Thomas Jefferson the purpose of the two religion clauses of the 1st Amendment is to establish a wall of separation between church and state.\n \nIt was agreed upon by an activist court in 1947.\nActually, the concept was first expressed by Roger Williams, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island. Of course, Williams was a proponent of religious freedom, which was why he was banished from Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Pilgrims were not in favor of religious freedom.\n \n But more to the point, Jefferson stated that separation of church and state was the purpose of the religious clauses of the 1st Amendment. He was responding to a letter from the Danbury Baptists who were afraid of religious persecution by a majority government. They were not afraid of persecution by atheists, but by christians.\n \n Subsequent to that, the principle was first recognized by a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court in 1878 [Reynolds v. United States (98 U.S. 145)], and many other cases decided by district and appeals courts as well as the Supreme Court. We can actually thank David Barton for compiling this list. But of course, as a christian trying to make a point, Marc only makes a vague reference to the case - i.e., some decision by an activist court in 1947. God forbid that he should actually support one of his points. I suspect that his reference is to Everson v. Board of Education (330 U.S. 1). But of course, christians don't need to give facts, only vague assertions.\n \nAnd those are based on our worldviews. All too often, science confuses \"conclusions\" with \"facts\".\nAnd all too often creationists confuse mythology with fact.\n \nThere is a difference between \"life\" and the complexity and order that we have here. The differences in complexity here, and simplicity on other planets, is unlikely with no guiding forces.\nWhat other planets are you talking about? How did you come by this information?\n \nThe Bible's testimony is no small, insignificant thing.\nCertainly not. The creation mythology of a nomadic tribe of herdsmen is quite significant. But still, there are no known facts that support the Biblical account.\n \n\"It\" is a broad term. The way Kenneth Miller describes it, (no Adam, no original sin) it doesn't appear to be accepted by anyone but atheists and agnostics.\nBut your theology seems to be a primitive as that of ancient, nomadic herdsmen.\n \nI don't agree, must be a worldview difference.\nSo unexplained magic is simpler than a reasonable explanation?\n \n [snip]further tripe[/snip]",

   "Indeed it can. According to Thomas Jefferson the purpose of the two religion clauses of the 1st Amendment is to establish a wall of separation between church and state.\n\n \n According to Thomas Jefferson, yes. Unfortunately for you, he never was declared the master intrepreter of the Constitution. He was one man, just like each of all the other framers were one man. At least however, most of them were actually in the country when the Bill of Rights was being discussed, ratified, etc. \n \n \nActually, the concept was first expressed by Roger Williams, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island. Of course, Williams was a proponent of religious freedom, which was why he was banished from Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Pilgrims were not in favor of religious freedom.\n \n But more to the point, Jefferson stated that separation of church and state was the purpose of the religious clauses of the 1st Amendment. He was responding to a letter from the Danbury Baptists who were afraid of religious persecution by a majority government. They were not afraid of persecution by atheists, but by christians.\n \n Subsequent to that, the principle was first recognized by a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court in 1878 [Reynolds v. United States (98 U.S. 145)], and many other cases decided by district and appeals courts as well as the Supreme Court. We can actually thank David Barton for compiling this list. But of course, as a christian trying to make a point, Marc only makes a vague reference to the case - i.e., some decision by an activist court in 1947. God forbid that he should actually support one of his points. I suspect that his reference is to Everson v. Board of Education (330 U.S. 1). But of course, christians don't need to give facts, only vague assertions. \n\n \n Yes, you're good with vague assertions, too. Here's William Rehnquist's vague assertion about these things, (Wallace vs. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38,92 (1985)\n \n \nIt is impossible to build sound constitutional doctrine upon a mistaken understanding of constitutional history, expressly freighted with Jefferson's misleading metaphor for nearly forty years. Thomas Jefferson was of course in France at the time the constitutional amendments known as the Bill of Rights were pressed by Congress and ratified by the States. His letter to the Danbury Baptists association was a short note of courtesy, written fourteen years after the amendments were passed by Congress. He would seem to any detached observer as a less than ideal source of contemporary history to the meaning of the Religion Clauses of the first amendment. \n\n \n I guess atheists are not \"detached observers\". They are very attached, to an anti traditional agenda. \n \n Rehnquist continues;\n \n \nThe establishment clause did not require government neutrality between religion and irreligion nor did it prohibit the Federal Government from providing nondiscriminatory aid to religion. There is simply no historical foundation for the proposition that the framers intended to build a \"wall of separation\" that was constitutionalized in Everson......\n .....The \"wall of separation between church and state\" is a metaphor based on bad history, a metaphor which has proved useless as a guide to judging. It should be frankly and explicitly abandoned. \n\n \n Even if you disagree with Rehnquist, one thing is for sure - Hi_It's_Me's statement \"It is part of the Bill of Rights\" really does have a truth value that can be determined. It's false. \n \n [snip] further tripe [/snip]",

Someone involved with Catholicism seemed to thing \"newadvent\" was worth putting on the web. It must have made sense to them. Maybe your being a militant atheist has more to do with making no sense to you than it's age? \n \n Was it a \"dumb stunt\" when one of you (don't remember who) advised me to read \"Origin of Species\" some time back? Isn't it about 150 years old? emoticon_confused \n \n \nGuys, it's time to give up on Marc. He's been making it quite clear in his last few threads that he is paranoid conspiracy theorist with a superiority complex. \n According to him:\n 1. Everyone on these boards is \"out to get him\" by posting (gasp!), forcing him to scramble to answer. \n 2. If you don't agree with exactly his pov, you're an atheist. Doesn't matter what you're beliefs are, not agreeing with Marc=false teacher and tool of the devil\n 3. The reason the ToE is accepted is not because of a preponderance of evidence, it's because all us atheist evildoers and false teachers don't want to own up to our responsibilities to god and don't want to go to hell (Now, who wants to explain to me how if I'm an atheist, I \"believe\" in the ToE to escape a god I don't believe in, so I don't go to a place I don't believe exists when I die. I know that sounds confusing, but that's because it's nonsensical). \n \n \n Oh, and Marc, just so you know, no one called me for help, I'm just tired of seeing you get absolutely slaughtered on here day after day by precise, logical arguments and seeing your rebuttals consisting of \"EAC!\" and 100 year old quotes. Do you want to impress us and have us seriously consider your points? Stop posting for 6 months. Read books, read websites, do some research; and not just from sources you already agree with. The thing you don't realize is, we've all researched creationism extensively. We've checked the websites, read the books, watched the videos, read the bible, etc. We know more about your position than you do. We also know a hell of a lot more about the ToE than you do, and no cries of \"EAC!\" will change the fact that you are pretty much clueless when it comes to anything that doesn't fit your preconceived notions of the world.\n \n So, go, research. Come back with some well thought out points because, I have to tell you, the conspiracy theory thing, and the denigrating of others faith, it's getting old.\n\n \n You really should work on that anger thing. I've hardly had any discussions with you. Is there anything I could do to calm you down? (besides leaving, of course :p )",

   "I believe that's true, and as a \"believer\" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says \"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters\". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be \"with\" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves \"not with\" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be \"with\" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?\n\n \n 1. Creationists deny God. You can't be \"with Jesus\" and deny God. So being with creationists is not being with Jesus.\n \n 2. Theistic evolutionists are not \"with\" atheists. That is, we disagree with atheism the faith. We agree that evolution happened, but we have no choice. We can't deny the evidence God left us in His Creation. What we do disagree with is the atheistic interpretation that evolution denies God. The scientific data doesn't support that conclusion.\n \n 3. You took Matthew 12:30 out of context. Jesus is talking about his conflict with the Pharisees -- which are those insisting on a literal interpretation of the Bible. He is not talking about agnostics and atheists. \n \n \nThe reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists isn't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments, it's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, Handgun Control, The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless. Miller continues;\n\n \n 1. I disagree with Miller's analysis of Lewontin. In several instances, Lewontin is making fun of the view.\n \n 2. Not everyone who disagrees with every position you hold is trying to force you. \n \n \n His mistake here, is that evolution isn't any of those social moral things because it shouldn't be. Yet he clearly shows, from Lewontin's words, that it IS. \n\n \n No, what Miller shows is that Lewontin has mistaken evolution for something it is not. Evolution really isn't any of those social moral things. People mistakenly try to link evolution with those -- such as the creationist claim that Hitler's racial policy was based on evolution -- but in reality evolution isn't it. \n \n Ideas are statements. Scientific theories are statements about the physical universe. You must distinguish between what the idea really is and what some people say the idea is.\n \n Militant atheists like to say that evolution mandates atheism. Of course they would say that, because they are promoting atheism. But you have to ask the question: does evolution REALLY mandate atheism? When you look at the statements of evolution, you find that it doesn't. No matter what militant atheists say. Just like creationism is a refuted scientific theory no matter how often creationists say it is valid.\n \n \n We have to make political decisions about evolution based on how best selling authors like Richard Dawkins USE IT to make themselves \"intellectually fulfilled atheists\". \n\n \n NO YOU DON'T! That's the point. You should make decisions on what evolution really is, not what Dawkins tries to use it for.\n \n As it happens, Dawkins is correct that evolution does allow atheists to be intellectually fulfilled. Evolution negates the Argument from Design as \"proof\" of the existence of God. So, before evolution, atheism was an irrational faith. Now atheism is a rational faith. BUT, all evolution did was show a \"proof\" of God was incorrect. Not that God did not exist, but that a particular \"proof\" didn't work. That's truth. Get used to it.\n \n \nIf Miller is genuinely disturbed about \"atheists in the scientific community who routinely enlist the material findings of evolutionary biology in support of their own philosophical pronouncements\", why doesn't he distance himself from them, in political matters? He joined them in the recent Dover case, and he has in many others. \n\n \n Because evolution is how God created. Sorry, but we can't lie to our kids. We can't tell them creationism is true when God tells us it is false.\n \n \nBut wait a minute! Hasn't science found that it's scientifically impossible for Jesus to be born of a virgin - no Y-chromosome?\n\n \n No. That's the point. Science, properly understood, does not tell us the miracle is impossible. Instead, if the miracle happened, our scientific theories would have to be modified.\n \n \nWhy is it okay for him to accept the virgin birth of Christ, and riducule anyone who believes in the creation of the first man, Adam?\n\n \n Because there is no evidence against the virgin birth and there is considerable evidence against Adam -- including the text of Genesis 1.\n \n \n If God could handle the Y-chromosome, couldn't God also handle creating the first, fully formed man?\n\n \n God could. But God didn't.\n \n \n It becomes more and more clear why atheists are comfortable with theistic evolution. If there was no Adam, there was no original sin, and no genealogy as described in the book of Genesis, only monkeys.\n\n \n 1. Militant atheists are not comfortable with theistic evolutionists. PZ Meyer regularly castigates Miller for his position.\n \n 2. Jesus died for our sins, not Adam's. The Adam and Eve is an allegory with Adam and Eve standing for each and every one of us. We ALL disobey God at some point in our life. The insistence on creaitonism has caused creationists to miss the point of Genesis 2-3. \n \n \nThen ALL the basics of Christianity, the nature of God and central New Testament teachings, including the way the sinner Adam (one man)and the Savior Jesus (one man) are linked together in Romans 5, 16-18, are trivialized just the way atheists love.\n\n \n Paul was trying to explain Christianity and Judaism to gentiles. He was trying to put Jesus into Judaism in a way that would make sense to people who were not Jewish. Don't read that so literally.\n \n \nHe finishes the book with \"What kind of God do I believe in? The answer is in these words. I believe in Darwin's God.\" \n\n \n And what does he mean by that? You apparently don't have a clue. Tell me, do you have any idea what \"secondary cause\" is?",

   "\n There should be more of a difference between them than there is. Going by the phrases that I highlighted in the above quotes from dictionary.com, an agnostic would be \"noncommittal\" - we see several on these forums who claim to be agnostic that commit themselves to declaring the Bible is mythology, etc. Huxley himself didn't seem very noncommittal. \n\n \n Your true god is showing -- the Bible.\n \n Agnostic refers to a position on GOD. You can declare the Bible to be mythology but still be non-committal on the existence of GOD. After all, the Bible is NOT God.\n \n \nIf an agnostic \"refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine\" yet commits to atheistic doctrine, (as we see all the time) then the difference between them is practically indistinguishable. As we can see, dictionary.com refers to them as synonyms.\n\n \n No, what it means is that the \"agnostic\" is not applying the correct label to himself. You are confusing the advocates of an idea (people) with the idea. \n \n Yes, many atheists try to call themselves \"agnostic\". Why? Because it disguises that atheism is a faith. But atheism and agnosticism are different. And Huxley was agnostic. He didn't have much use for the politics of Anglicanism -- particularly their control of science -- but he was genuinely agnostic. Huxley did not deny the existence of God.\n \n The idea is very simple:\n \n The basic question is: Does a deity(ies) exist? There are 3 possible answers:\n 1. I believe deity exists. This is theism, deism, polytheism.\n 2. I believe a deity does not exist. This is atheism.\n 3. I don't know whether a deity exists or not. This is agnosticism.",

Judeo-Christianity is not a monolith like you are trying to pretend. There are 20,000 Christian denominations.\n \n It is worse because Fundamentalism is not Christian. So, even if we say that Judeo-Christianity does not violate the 1st Ammendment, Fundamentalism does. Of course, in the presence of Islam, Hinduism, Mormonism, and atheism, Judeo-Christianity can indeed violate the 1st Ammendment if the government supports that religion exclusively.\n \n \nThe authors I cite are evolutionists, and they are also politically active atheists. They are masters at blending the two, and incorporating them into politics, and school curriculums. \n\n \n Not in school curriculums. I have yet to see any creationist document where evolution is taught as atheism in public schools K-12. If you have such documentation, please share it. I will pass it on to NCSE so it can be corrected.\n \n \nMandatory Bible reading and religious symbols on public property weren't a problem in the past. \n\n \n But they should have been. Part of the reason was that non-Christians simply didn't have the courage to challenge them. And Christians didn't have the sensitivity to realize the mistake they were making. Now both conditions have been met. It's time for Christians to realize their mistake and correct it.\n \n \nThen I said one Jewish family doesn't necessarily represent all Jews - I never called them atheists. \n \n But again, if a political desicion has only two choices, and Jewish and Mormon groups side with atheists, at least in that moment there is no difference between them.\n\n \n Hmm. if there is no \"difference\", that is the same as saying they ARE atheists.

   "Even if true, it is irrelevant. \n\n \n It's not irrelevant at all. My main reason for discussing this, for starting this thread, is to find out if theistic evolution contributes to an increase in atheism in the U.S. \n \n \nWhat has happened over the last 50 years is \n 1. Atheists have decided not to have theism forced on them.\n 2. Courts have been willing to acknowledge that atheism is a valid faith and not force theism on them. \n\n \n I agree that's what they've decided, but I don't agree that theism has been forced on them. Do you think it has been forced on them, in violation of the first amendment? \n \n \nWhen the Establishment Clause was written, atheism was an irrational faith and could be safely ignored. The First Amendment was meant to protect theists from one another. Specifical one denomination from other denominations of Christians. \n\n \n I agree - but more than \"irrational\" at that time, atheism was safely ignored because it was unorganized. Not so today - it's as organized as any religion, and should have the first amendment applied to it in the same way. \n \n \n \nHowever, atheism is now a rational faith. Therefore it has to be considered when we consider separation of church and state. \n\n \n And I don't believe it is. Atheism uses evolution as a tool, and evolution enjoys a higher profile today among lay people than ever before. Newspaper articles, television programs, magazines, school curriculums, - its atheist implications are not being as carefully separated from state as some traditional religious practices. And it shows;\n \n \nThe days when churches could simply open their doors and people would flock in just because it was someplace to go, are mostly gone. \n \n Increasingly, churches and ministries now have to not only compete with a wide, wide world of secular temptations, but often with each other as well. \n\n \n http://prweb.com/releases/2006/2/prweb344779.htm#\n \n \nNo longer can the state by basically theist and just have separation of the state from particular versions of theism. \n\n \n Why not? Why is that such a problem for theistic evolutionists? \n \n \nInstead, the state must be agnostic and be separate from ANY version of theism. \n\n \n There simply isn't enough difference between atheism and agnosticism. Why don't theistic evolutionists see that?\n \n \n \nIf it can't be found on Lexis it doesn't exist. Have you considered that the people you trust are not worthy of that trust and do make up cases to scare you? \n\n \n There's always that possibility, I try to use common sense. Have you considered that atheists you trust make up things about evolution to get theistic evolutionists on their side politically? Why are you answering questions from post #71? Obvious_child does not claim to represent theistic evolution. emoticon_confused \n \n \n \n \n As I've said before - when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined.\n\n \n \nThat doesn't follow. Yes, the courts are ruling differently than they did a century ago. However, that is because they are realizing that the situation is different than it was a century ago. The courts are recognizing that it is unconstitutional to force theism on atheists. \n\n \n Today's courts are recognizing more about the intent of the framers than previous generations that were closer to the actual framers? I think not - today's courts simply think they know more than the framers. It's a matter of orginalism vs. non-originalism. \n \n http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/interp.html\n \n \n \nBTW, you don't represent Christians, either.\n\n \n That's funny - the atheists here tell me the same thing. With you, as with Kenneth Miller's book, I'm still not seeing much difference between theistic evolution and atheism.",

   "No, they are not. It means that one of the political choices forces a view of theism that they don't share down their throats. \n\n \n Yes, and it shows that they are more comfortable with atheism than another form of theism.  Why do theistic evolutionists oppose other forms of theism far stronger than they do atheism? \n \n \n \nRemember, the Establishment Clause was originally designed to protect theists from other theists! So, some of the policies seek to establish a particular type of theism -- Fundamentalism -- over other types of theism. \n\n \n Militant atheism seeks to divide Christianity by labeling those that they see as the biggest threat to their political agenda (separation of church & state) as \"fundamentalists\". It's intended to be a derogatory term. Does theistic evolution see \"fundamentalists\" as it's biggest threat also - far more than atheism? \n \n \nI submit that it is actually worse. The policies seek to establish Fundamentalism, but Fundamentalism is NOT theism. So the objection of Mormons and Jews is that they don't want the state to establish a false idol as a state faith. \n\n \n Do ALL theistic evolutionists declare that \"fundamentalism\" is not theism? Many here have tried to tell me that Catholics are theistic evolutionists. Does this mean that Catholics oppose \"fundamentalism\"? I don't see it in the U.S. \n \n \n \nThe general population is not supposed to be represented in court cases, particularly ones involving Bill of Rights issues. The court is supposed to prevent the tyranny of the majority and protect the mimority view from such tyranny. \n\n \n I agree, but that's irrelevant to what I was saying. (I still don't understand why you're answering for other posters) He was making a comparison between the opinions of the general population and these forums, and there are vast differences. \n \n \n \nSo? \n\n \n His implication was that if the Judeo Christian is represented in any way by the U.S. government, that the religion of Islam has to get equal, fair treatment. The U.S framers and traditions are not Muslim!!\n \n \n \n \nThanksgiving is a secular holiday. \n\n \n It gives thanks to a Creator. emoticon_confused Are the Ten Commandments secular?\n \n \n But yes, the Judeo-Christian denominations did violate the 1st Ammendment. In 1800 Massachusetts taxed anyone not belonging to the Congregational Church. In Virginia, anyone not belonging to the Anglican Church was taxed. Two different denominations of Christianity were the established churches in those states. \n\n \n State issues vs. Federal issues. That's straying a little too far from our topic IMO. \n \n \n \nIt was Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians who were doing the objecting. Judeo-Christianity is not a monolith like you are trying to pretend. There are 20,000 Christian denominations. \n\n \n \"Not a monolith\" - you and atheists heartily agree on that too.\n \n \nIt is worse because Fundamentalism is not Christian. \n\n \n Another one you and atheists heartliy agree on. \n \n \n \nSo, even if we say that Judeo-Christianity does not violate the 1st Ammendment, Fundamentalism does. \n\n \n And we're just now discovering it, even though it's been happening since the founding of the country? \n \n \n Of course, in the presence of Islam, Hinduism, Mormonism, and atheism, Judeo-Christianity can indeed violate the 1st Ammendment if the government supports that religion exclusively. \n\n \n I don't see a big huge threat of it. Apparantly, atheists and theistic evolutionists have exactly the same fears there, also. \n \n \n \nNot in school curriculums. I have yet to see any creationist document where evolution is taught as atheism in public schools K-12. If you have such documentation, please share it. I will pass it on to NCSE so it can be corrected. \n\n \n I may work on that when I get time, but the response from atheism and theistic evolution would be predictable - that it's evolution, pure innocent evolution, with no implications that there is no God. \n \n \n \nBut they should have been. Part of the reason was that non-Christians simply didn't have the courage to challenge them. And Christians didn't have the sensitivity to realize the mistake they were making. Now both conditions have been met. It's time for Christians to realize their mistake and correct it. \n\n \n That's how non-orginalism works, that I referred to in the link above. Atheists and theistic evolutionists seem to have common ground there. \n \n \n \n \nHmm. if there is no \"difference\", that is the same as saying they ARE atheists. \n\n \n No difference in that case. It wouldn't necessarily have to affix a label to them for one agreement in one case. As we are seeing from you and from Kenneth Miller's book, there are a boatload of cases where atheism and theistic evolution have no differences. The affixing of labels could be different here. emoticon_xangel \n \n \nApparently you don't consider the meaning of what you post.\n\n \n And you may be getting angry.",

God's Creation. So, by denying everything we see in God's Creation and insisting instead on a literal, inerrant reading of Genesis 1-3, creationists are denying God. \n\n \n Creationists don't deny what science finds, it questions what science theorizes, with an atheist philosophy.

Try science. \n\n \n There is a huge difference in the things he described above, and what science does to determine what happened billions of years ago, what chance, evolutionary principles affect human behavior - countless other philosophical things that science involves itself in. Atheism doesn't bother to try to distinguish between the two, and neither, apparantly, does theistic evolution. \n \n \n \nAs I said, you don't have a clue. You are SO wrong. These are quotes from Origin of Species. I doubt they will help you, but at least you will have the straight information for your denial. \n\n \n So the \"Origin of Species\" has more information for theistic evolutionists than the Bible does??  Does theistic evolution believe in Satan?\n \n \n\"To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual.\" pg. 449.\n \n \"But with regard to the material world, we can at least go so far as this -- we can perceive that events are brought about not by insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each particular case, but by the establishment of general laws\" Whewell: Bridgewater Treatise. \n \n \"The only distinct meaning of the word 'natural' is stated, fixed, or settled; since what is natural as much requires and presupposes an intelligent agent to render it so, i.e., to effect it continually or at stated times, as what is supernatural or miraculous does to effect it for once.\" Butler: Analogy of Revealed Religion.\n \n \"To conclude, therefore, let no man out of a weak conceit of sobriety, or an ill-applied moderation, think or maintain, that a man can search too far or be too well studied in the book of God's word, or in the book of God's works; divinity or philosophy; but rather let men endeavour an endless progress or proficience in both.\" Bacon: Advancement of Learning\n All from the Fontispiece \n\n \n \"The book of God's word\" - atheists don't agree with that part.

I mention this because you seem to assign \"trust\" to particular authors. I would think Moreland would be among those you trust. \n\n \n He very well could be, yes. So atheism believes only in secondary causes, \"fundamentalism\" can believe in both primary and secondary causes, and theistic evolution believes in primary and secondary causes? The differences in theistic evolution and fundamentalism would be that fundamentalism believes in far more primary causes than does theistic evolution? \n \n \nRemember that Darwin referred to evolution as the secondary cause by which \"the Creator\" acted. So, when Miller says \"I believe in Darwin's God\", he is saying that God sustains the natural process of evolution and an intermediate agent. \n\n \n And if the \"natural process of evolution\" is determined by humans in a university lab, many with an atheist worldview, that clash with something the Bible says, you and Kenneth Miller immediately toss the Bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked? \n \n \n\"A Law of Nature then is the rule and Law, according to which God resolved that certain Motions should always, that is, in all Cases be performed.

Understanding these natural phenomena as secondary causes, places God above them where increased ability to explain how they occur not only does not \"decrease\" God, but adds wonder to His creation.\" http://www.leaderu.com/offices/o_helweg/science_andor_faith.html\n\n \n And depending on what human is \"finding the answers\" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings. \n \n \n\"This example illustrates the limits beyond which science cannot take us. By its very nature science deals with what theologians call 'secondary causes', that is, with interactions within nature. It cannot deal with 'primary causes', that is, the ultimate origin and purpose of nature. \" http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/CIS/lucas/lecture.html\n\n \n Many atheist scientists disagree with that. Why don't theistic evolutionists take them to task over that? \n \n \n\"5.3. Thomas Aquinas: God Acts Through Secondary Causes\n \n 5.3.1. Primary and Secondary Causes\n \n Example: consider the quality and beauty of piano music at a concert.\n \n Primary Cause: the gifted pianist with the ability to play the piano beautifully\n \n Secondary Cause: the piano\n \n The primary cause (the gifted pianist) must work through the secondary cause (the piano) to achieve the effect they desire. If the piano is horribly out of tune . . . .\n \n \n \n \n 5.3.2. God Works in the World Indirectly Through Secondary Causes\n \n Aquinas:\n \n God is the primary cause of everything, but has chosen to work indirectly through secondary causes. (i.e. \"delegating\" divine action) God might try to move a human will, for example, in order to help an ill person\"\n http://www.stjohnadulted.org/The_01.htm#Thomas%20Aquinas:%20God%20Acts%20Through%20Secondary%20Causes\n \n \"This doctrine establishes the reality of \"Secondary Causes\" \n Though God is not the cause of sin, it does have a cause. Evil can only be found in the creature. Therefore the creature is the only efficient and proximate cause of sin. We are not created as just machines following impersonal programming. We are persons who act morally. We are responsible for our actions before God. This is why the doctrine of the decrees differs so completely from the doctrine of fatalism. ... How is the idea of secondary causes necessary in maintaining a biblical view of God, creation and of moral law?\" http://www.girs.com/library/theology/syllabus/theo4.html\n\n \n I'll have to look all that over when I get more time, but I didn't notice anything resembling this kind of detail in Kenneth Miller's book - maybe because his buddy Richard Dawkins would disagree with it?",

   "So theistic evolution is not a belief, not a faith at all? It is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science, using God to fill gaps? \n\n \n 1. Let's go back and look at claims, because your statement is not tied to what I was talking about.\n \n \"Originally Posted by marc9000 \n \"Creationists deny God\" - I can't go much further with you until you give me a source for that belief. \"\n \n To that I replied that the statement \"Creationists deny God\" is NOT a belief, but a conclusion derived from reason and evidence. Nothing in it at all about theistic evolution.\n \n 2. The \"theistic\" part of theistic evolution is a belief. Just like the \"atheist\" part of atheistic evolution is a belief. The \"evolution\" part isn't a belief.\n \n 3. Theistic evolution is definitely NOT \"using God to fill gaps\". Using God to fill gaps is ID. Theistic evolution simply says that the material processes discoverd by science are the secondary causes (the material causes) God used to create. No gaps. \n \n \nCreationists don't deny what science finds, it questions what science theorizes, with an atheist philosophy. Let's look at a paragraph from Kenneth Miller (the theistic evolutionist's) book, quoted from Carl Sagan, the atheist;\n\n \n Marc, I need a book and page number for that quote. It sounds like Sagan from Demon Haunted World, not Miller. Sagan died in December 1996. Miller's most famous book about science and God was not published until 1999. So that leaves out that book. Before that, Miller wrote textbooks and didn't mention God. So how could Sagan quote from a book written after Sagan died?\n \n \nThere is a huge difference in the things he described above, and what science does to determine what happened billions of years ago, what chance, evolutionary principles affect human behavior - countless other philosophical things that science involves itself in. \n\n \n I don't see a huge difference. The same methodology science used to come up with sonograms and amniocentesis was used to come up with evolution. After all, both sonic imaging and amniocentesis are theories. \n \n \nSo the \"Origin of Species\" has more information for theistic evolutionists than the Bible does?? Does theistic evolution believe in Satan?\n\n \n Origin of Species has more information on the relationship of evolution to theology than the Bible does. Since the Bible has no such information, that wouldn't take much. emoticon_xhoho Darwin took standard Christian theology. Creationism denies that theology. \n \n BTW, the OT doesn't \"believe in Satan\" the way Fundamentalists do, either. For that you need to go to the non-Biblical Essenes and Milton. So why are you taking such non-Biblical sources for major theological beliefs?\n \n \n\"The book of God's word\" - atheists don't agree with that part. You've indicated that you don't either. \n\n \n Where did I indicate that? I don't agree with a literal interpreation of that part of scripture, but then scripture itself tells me not to take it literally. Sorry, a literal interpretation of the Bible is not \"God's word\". That you think so shows how much you do not worship God.\n \n \nHe very well could be, yes. So atheism believes only in secondary causes, \"fundamentalism\" can believe in both primary and secondary causes, and theistic evolution believes in primary and secondary causes? The differences in theistic evolution and fundamentalism would be that fundamentalism believes in far more primary causes than does theistic evolution?\n\n \n Atheism believes secondary causes act on their own. Theistic evolutionists believe that secondary causes require God in order to work. Fundamentalists believe that 1) God does not exist unless their are primary causes and 2) there are only primary causes. In essence, Fundies believe like atheists: if there are material causes, then God is absent.\n \n \nAnd if the \"natural process of evolution\" is determined by humans in a university lab, many with an atheist worldview, that clash with something the Bible says, you and Kenneth Miller immediately toss the Bible out and accept what the humans say - no questions asked? \n\n \n We accept what God says. You say \"nature\" is something that doesn't have God in it. But who created nature? God, right? Therefore, nature is something God wrote. OTOH, humans wrote scripture. Even more, a literal interpretation is done by humans. So, when we have something God did vs something humans say about God, Miller and I choose God. \n \n Calvin told us that it doesn't matter what the worldview is. So what if the scientist is atheist? The data is the same. That's the essence of science: the data must be the same for everyone, no matter what their worldview is. Now, if the atheist projects his personal beliefs on the data and says the data show atheism is \"fact\", then Miller and I do object. Because then the person is not being a scientist anymore, but mislabeling his personal beliefs as science.\n \n \nSo the main disagreements between fundamentalists and theistic evolutionists are what are, and are not first (primary) causes.\n\n \n Oh no. The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren't worshipping God, but a false idol of their own making.\n \n \n And atheists believe everything is a second cause (or first cause) with no intelligence behind it. \n\n \n Nope. Atheists believe material causes -- what you are mislabeling \"secondary causes\" -- happen on their own. Theists believe that material causes require God's will in order to work.\n \n \nIt still doesn't make any sense to me why theistic evolutionists are in such agreement with atheists, and so far apart from \"fundamentalists\". \n\n \n We don't agree with atheists about atheism. DUH! But we agree that evolution happened. That's because the data is the same for all of us. Theistic evolutionists believe that evolution is how God created. Atheistic evolutionists believe evolution happened on its own without God. There is no scientific data to resolve that difference. So we live and let live.\n \n Fundies/creationists insist on their interpretation of scripture over what God tells us. So, we don't listen to them; we listen to God.\n \n \n I love that second one \"science as a product of a Christian worldview\". Then why are such a huge percentage of Biological scientists atheists? \n\n \n Define \"huge percentage\". Depending on how you define theism, anywhere from 50% to 90% of biologists are theists. Now, include agnosticism and that doesn't leave a \"huge percentage\" to be atheists.\n \n \"Johnson encapsulates his major insistence by writing: 'In the broadest sense, a 'creationist' is simply a person who believes the world (and especially mankind) was *designed* and exists for a *purpose*.\" Darwinism, Johnson claims, inherently and explicitly denies such a belief and therefore constitutes a naturalistic philosophy intrinsically opposed to religion.\n \"But this is the oldest canard and non sequitor in the debater's book. To say it for all my colleageues and for the umpteenth millionth time (from college bull sessions to learned treatises): science simply cannot (by its legitimate methods) adjudicate the issue of God's possible superintendence of nature. We neither affirm nor deny it; we simply can't comment on it as scientists. ... Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny other types of actors (like God) in other spheres (the moral realm, for example).\n \"Forget philosophy for a moment; the simple empirics of the past hundred years should suffice. Darwin himself was agnostic (having lost his beliefs upon the tragic death of his favorite daughter), but the great American botanist Asa Gray, who favored natural selection and wrote a book entitled Darwiniana, was a devout Christian. Move forward 50 years: Charles D. Walcott, discoverer of the Burgess Shale fossils, was a convinced Darwinian and an equally firm Christian, who believed that God had ordained natural selection to construct a history of life according to His plans and purposes. Move on another 50 years to the two greatest evolutionists of our generation: G.G. Simpson was a humanist agnostic, Theodosius Dobzhansky a believing Russian Orthodox. Either half my colleagues are enormously stupid, or else the science of Darwinism is fully compatible with conventional religious beliefs -- and equally compatible with atheism, thus proving that the two great realms of nature's factuality and the source of human morality do not strongly overlap.\"\n SJ Gould, Impeaching a self-appointed judge. Scientific American, 267:79-80, July 1992. \n \n \n \n I don't see evidence of the Carl Sagan's, Richard Dawkins' etc, making references to primary and secondary causes. Didn't notice it in Miller's book either. \n\n \n Sagan and Dawkins don't. That's because they don't believe in secondary causes. They are atheists, therefore they believe material causes are the only causes. However, Dawkins has shown one way for God to intervene in evolution and be indectable to science. Ironic, isn't it? emoticon_xhoho \n \n As to Miller, I suggest Chapter 8 of Finding Darwin's God. A lot of it is devoted to the 2 questions in science where God is still scientifically acceptable as primary cause, but a lot of it has the concept of secondary cause embedded in it: \n \n \"God would use material processes ..\" That's a very clear invocation of secondary cause. pg 252\n \n Miller also quotes Howard van Till describing St. Augustine on pg 254:\n \n \"The universe was brought into being in a less than fully formed state but endowed with the capacities to transform itself, in conformity with God's will, from unformed matter into a marvelous array of structures and lifeforms. In other words, Augustine envisioned a Creation that was, from the instant of its inception, characterized by functional integrity\"\n \n That is secondary cause.\n \n \"What we have learned from science explains, for the first time in human history, how God could have solved the overpowering logical problems of His divine nature by creating for us a distinctive world of meaning and substance.\" pg 258\n \n \"The irony is that only those who embrace the scientific reality of evolution are adequately prepared to give God the credit and the power that He truly deserves.\"\n \n \"We are now far enough along in the development of science to appreciate that its track record suggests that ultimately it will find natural causes for natural phenomena. God has fashioned a self-consistent reality in nature,\" pg 252\n \n I don't think you have EVER read Finding Darwin's God. You have just read people who have given false witness about it. Now, if a person willingly repeats false witness without checking for the truth, is that person also guilty of false witness? \n \n \nAnd depending on what human is \"finding the answers\" it can unfortunately cheapen and deny many central Biblical teachings. \n\n \n How? How can the human do anything about God? The only way to \"cheapen\" the teachings is to deny what God teaches us (atheist and theist alike) in His Creation. You need to read more of St. Augustine.\n \n \nMany atheist scientists disagree with that. Why don't theistic evolutionists take them to task over that?\n\n \n 1. Actually, not \"many\" You can count on two hands the number that really do take on primary causes: Sagan, Wilson, Dawkins, Atkins, PZ Myers (Dennett and Provine, but they are philosphers). The vast majority of scientists who are agnostic and atheists do not engage in this.\n \n 2. And yes, scientists do take them to In fact, some agnostic and atheist scientists take them to task. Eugenie Scott, head of the NCSE, has done so many times. So has Michael Ruse (altho he is also a philosopher). Scientists such as Miller, and others have entered the fray. There is a book called Science Held Hostage by (theists) Van Till, Menninga, and Young that takes on scientists who step beyond the science to atheism.\n \n 3. The scientists who go beyond the bounds do not attack science. Therefore most scientist who are theists don't get involved. They have 3 main reasons: 1) they are secure enough in their own faith that they don't view what is being done as a threat, 2) since they know where science ends and faith begins, most simply filter out the religious aspects as being personal and therefore, not worth commenting on and 3) there is nothing for them to argue, as scientists. Creationism, OTOH, gets the science wrong and is a direct threat to science.\n \n \nI'll have to look all that over when I get more time, but I didn't notice anything resembling this kind of detail in Kenneth Miller's book \n\n \n More likely because you haven't read Miller's book. It's all there in Chapters8 and 9.",

Nothing in it at all about theistic evolution. \n\n \n There really is something in it about theistic evolution, because YOU, as a theistic evolutionist, made the statement. There are many atheists who claim to have read the Bible, and even though they reject it, they claim to be knowledgeable enough about it to proclaim that \"creationists deny God\", because \"reason and evidence\" tell them that - reason and evidence gathered from a \"there is no God\" presupposition. The very same one that theistic evolutionists seem to have. \n \n \n2. The \"theistic\" part of theistic evolution is a belief. Just like the \"atheist\" part of atheistic evolution is a belief. The \"evolution\" part isn't a belief. \n\n \n Evolution isn't a belief? I suppose it depends on which definition of evolution we use, as there are many. Suppose some atheist scientists, behind their usual closed doors, analyze and theorize that religion is a product of the human brains evolution. Do theistic evolutionists accept that without question? Would that evolutionary discovery inspire you to completely reject theology as a quirk in your brain to be cast off, so you could be as perfect as those who were born without that quirk, like Richard Dawkins or Edward O. Wilson? \n \n \n \n3. Theistic evolution is definitely NOT \"using God to fill gaps\". Using God to fill gaps is ID. Theistic evolution simply says that the material processes discoverd by science are the secondary causes (the material causes) God used to create. No gaps. \n\n \n Creationists often say that too, that God uses material processes. The difference seems to be that creationists question the humans who represent science when they make claims that much or all of the book of Genesis is false. Theistic evolutionists seem to routinely accept human claims over Biblical claims without question. The Bible plainly warns about that, and there is no complex interpretation questions about those warnings. Except to toss them out, as atheists do. \n \n \n \n \nMarc, I need a book and page number for that quote. It sounds like Sagan from Demon Haunted World, not Miller. Sagan died in December 1996.

Let's go through it slowly; If you need a book, does the title of this post \"FINDING DARWIN'S GOD\" ring a bell? There are only two references to Sagan in the index, pages 194 and 221. Trying page 194 first, we find that quote! Now read what I said again; \"a paragraph from Kenneth Miller....quoted from Carl Sagan\" It really is possible to quote someone after they die. My point in quoting it was that it was a Godless, secular paragraph that Sagan as an atheist proclaimed, and Miller as a theistic evolutionist heartily agrees with. The paragraph covered amemia, polio, etc, but left out abortion, embryonic stem cell research etc. Another coincidence? \n \n \n \n \nI don't see a huge difference. \n\n \n You deleted the final sentence from my quote. This one \"Atheism doesn't bother to distinguish between the two, and neither, apparently, does theistic evolution.\" If you'd have left that sentence in and thought about it, maybe you'd have seen a huge difference, a huge influence those things can have on political discussions. \n \n \n \nThe same methodology science used to come up with sonograms and amniocentesis was used to come up with evolution. \n\n \n Are sonic imaging and amniocentisis \"theories\" in the same way that things like abiogenesis and religion \"brain quirks\" are? Atheists think so, do you? \n \n \nAfter all, both sonic imaging and amniocentesis are theories. \n\n \n Yes I know, gravity is a theory too. emoticon_rolleyes Sonic imaging, gravity, religious brain quirks - there are many other \"theories\" atheists try to compare and confuse with their philosophy to try to make them indistinguishable. As a theistic evolutionlist, Miller doesn't seem to mind. \n \n \n \n \nOrigin of Species has more information on the relationship of evolution to theology than the Bible does. Since the Bible has no such information, that wouldn't take much. emoticon_xhoho Darwin took standard Christian theology. Creationism denies that theology. \n\n \n \"Creationists deny God\"....\"Creationism denies Christian theology\" - atheist proclamations that you have thus far failed to back up. \n \n \n \nBTW, the OT doesn't \"believe in Satan\" the way Fundamentalists do, either. For that you need to go to the non-Biblical Essenes and Milton. So why are you taking such non-Biblical sources for major theological beliefs?\n\n \n My interpretation tells me they ARE Biblical, and plenty of credentialed Christian theologians agree with me. Your interpretation tells you that they are non Biblical, and you have plenty of atheist company. Theistic evolution doesn't seem to fall anywhere near the halfway point between creation and atheism, does it? \n \n \n \nWhere did I indicate that? \n\n \n You've indicated that you believe the Bible to be a \"false idol\". From the \"help me out here\" thread;\n \n \nBut you cannot believe in a god of a literal inerrant Bible and accept evolution. However, as a Christian I don't have any problem with that. After all, if your god is a literal inerrant Bible you are worshipping a false idol. \n\n \n \n \n I don't agree with a literal interpreation of that part of scripture, but then scripture itself tells me not to take it literally. \n\n \n Chapter and verse? \n \n \nSorry, a literal interpretation of the Bible is not \"God's word\". That you think so shows how much you do not worship God. \n\n \n Each Christian denomination has varying views of what is \"literal\" and how it's to be applied to everyday life. All that can get complicated, but the simple fact that theistic evolution doesn't seem concerned enough about it to define it's beliefs through it's own denomination makes one wonder how concerned it really is about theisim - how it's followers seem to be content to do the same things on Sunday mornings that atheists do.\n \n \n \n \nAtheism believes secondary causes act on their own. Theistic evolutionists believe that secondary causes require God in order to work. Fundamentalists believe that 1) God does not exist unless their are primary causes and 2) there are only primary causes. In essence, Fundies believe like atheists: if there are material causes, then God is absent. \n\n \n \"Fundies believe like atheists\" - interesting. Atheists often use the somewhat derogatory term \"fundies\". You use it too, yet you seem to have no derogatory term for atheists. \n \n \n \n \nWe accept what God says. You say \"nature\" is something that doesn't have God in it. \n\n \n Where did I say that? All Christianity sees God in nature. \n \n \n But who created nature? God, right? Therefore, nature is something God wrote. OTOH, humans wrote scripture. Even more, a literal interpretation is done by humans. So, when we have something God did vs something humans say about God, Miller and I choose God. \n\n \n But you and Miller are humans too. Very convienient how you can make God whatever you want him to be. Are you idolizing yourselves? \n \n \nCalvin told us that it doesn't matter what the worldview is. \n\n \n Who is Calvin?\n \n \nSo what if the scientist is atheist? The data is the same. That's the essence of science: the data must be the same for everyone, no matter what their worldview is. Now, if the atheist projects his personal beliefs on the data and says the data show atheism is \"fact\", then Miller and I do object. Because then the person is not being a scientist anymore, but mislabeling his personal beliefs as science. \n\n \n And you seem to be saying that personal beliefs influencing science are the exception rather than the rule. I have a different view about human frailty - I'm learning how theistic evolution undermines the basic way of reading the Bible, and how it makes sin largely meaningless. The reality of sin is basic in theology. \n \n \n \nOh no. The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren't worshipping God, but a false idol of their own making. \n\n \n The Bible? - yes you've made that very clear, and atheists love you for it. The Bible was written over a period of fourteen hundred years, over forty generations, by over forty authors, from all walks of life, written on three continents. There are many things in it that I don't like. But since I'm not God, it's not my call to twist it to suit myself. It's far from being an \"idol\" and you know it if you're a theist. \n \n \n \n \nNope. Atheists believe material causes -- what you are mislabeling \"secondary causes\" -- happen on their own. Theists believe that material causes require God's will in order to work. \n\n \n What's the difference between material causes and secondary causes? \n \n \n \n \nWe don't agree with atheists about atheism. DUH! But we agree that evolution happened. That's because the data is the same for all of us. Theistic evolutionists believe that evolution is how God created. Atheistic evolutionists believe evolution happened on its own without God. There is no scientific data to resolve that difference. So we live and let live. \n\n \n \"Live and let live\", by helping atheists \"separate church and state\", and politically fight creationists every step of the way? Do you think atheists are being discriminated against in the U.S.? \n \n \nFundies/creationists insist on their interpretation of scripture over what God tells us. So, we don't listen to them; we listen to God. \n\n \n And God speaks to you through evolution, the same evolution that atheists use to proclaim that there is no God?\n \n \n \nDefine \"huge percentage\". Depending on how you define theism, anywhere from 50% to 90% of biologists are theists. Now, include agnosticism and that doesn't leave a \"huge percentage\" to be atheists. \n\n \n Your percentages aren't commonly claimed. \n \n From Miller's book, page 19;\n \nOver years of teaching and research in science, I have come to realize that a presumption of atheism or agnosticism is universal in academic life. \n\n \n page 184;\n \nThe conventions of academic life, almost universally, revolve around the assumption that religious belief is something that people grow out of as they become educated. \n\n \n Scientists come from academies. A general concensus from all around the internet puts the percentages of atheistic biological scientists in the high 90's. Your percentages are wrong. When it comes to the study of science, and the paths it takes, there's not a dimes worth of difference between an agnostic and an atheist. \n \n \n\"Johnson encapsulates his major insistence by writing: 'In the broadest sense, a 'creationist' is simply a person who believes the world (and especially mankind) was *designed* and exists for a *purpose*.\" Darwinism, Johnson claims, inherently and explicitly denies such a belief and therefore constitutes a naturalistic philosophy intrinsically opposed to religion.\n \"But this is the oldest canard and non sequitor in the debater's book. To say it for all my colleageues and for the umpteenth millionth time (from college bull sessions to learned treatises): science simply cannot (by its legitimate methods) adjudicate the issue of God's possible superintendence of nature. We neither affirm nor deny it; we simply can't comment on it as scientists. ... Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny other types of actors (like God) in other spheres (the moral realm, for example). \n\n \n Can you or Mr. Johnson explain why Richard Dawkins book, The BLIND watchmaker, sold so well? Apparently, millions of book readers prove Mr. Johnson wrong, don't they? \n \n \n \n\"Forget philosophy for a moment; the simple empirics of the past hundred years should suffice. Darwin himself was agnostic (having lost his beliefs upon the tragic death of his favorite daughter), but the great American botanist Asa Gray, who favored natural selection and wrote a book entitled Darwiniana, was a devout Christian. Move forward 50 years: Charles D. Walcott, discoverer of the Burgess Shale fossils, was a convinced Darwinian and an equally firm Christian, who believed that God had ordained natural selection to construct a history of life according to His plans and purposes. Move on another 50 years to the two greatest evolutionists of our generation: G.G. Simpson was a humanist agnostic, Theodosius Dobzhansky a believing Russian Orthodox. Either half my colleagues are enormously stupid, or else the science of Darwinism is fully compatible with conventional religious beliefs -- and equally compatible with atheism, thus proving that the two great realms of nature's factuality and the source of human morality do not strongly overlap.\"\n SJ Gould, Impeaching a self-appointed judge. Scientific American, 267:79-80, July 1992. \n\n \n If half his colleagues can't see how Dawkins, Wilson, Dennett, Lewontin, Sagan, Gould, and many other prominent atheist evolutionists affect politics, they really are enormously stupid. \n \n \n \n \n \nSagan and Dawkins don't. That's because they don't believe in secondary causes. They are atheists, therefore they believe material causes are the only causes. However, Dawkins has shown one way for God to intervene in evolution and be indectable to science. Ironic, isn't it? emoticon_xhoho \n\n \n Yes it is, Dawkins can do anything he wants - he wasn't born with that \"religion quirk\" was he? He can show \"God to intervene\", Miller can heap praise on him, and he and allllllllll theistic evolutionists can chuckle about together, can't they? \n \n \nAs to Miller, I suggest Chapter 8 of Finding Darwin's God. A lot of it is devoted to the 2 questions in science where God is still scientifically acceptable as primary cause, but a lot of it has the concept of secondary cause embedded in it: \n \n \"God would use material processes ..\" That's a very clear invocation of secondary cause. pg 252 \n\n \n I can't find that statement - it's NOT ON page 252. I don't remember seeing the word \"secondary\" anywhere in the book. It may have been in there, but I'd like for you to show me where there was a detailed description of \"primary\" and \"secondary\" causes. \n \n \nMiller also quotes Howard van Till describing St. Augustine on pg 254:\n \n \"The universe was brought into being in a less than fully formed state but endowed with the capacities to transform itself, in conformity with God's will, from unformed matter into a marvelous array of structures and lifeforms. In other words, Augustine envisioned a Creation that was, from the instant of its inception, characterized by functional integrity\"\n \n That is secondary cause.\n\n \n It was on page 255. Is all theistic evolution this precise? \n \n \n\"What we have learned from science explains, for the first time in human history, how God could have solved the overpowering logical problems of His divine nature by creating for us a distinctive world of meaning and substance.\" pg 258\n\n \n You got that page number right!! \n \n \n\"The irony is that only those who embrace the scientific reality of evolution are adequately prepared to give God the credit and the power that He truly deserves.\" \n\n \n And this one from the same page, if you wouldn't have quoted it, I sure would have!! So only evolutionists, not Bible scholars, are capable of giving God credit and power!! Talking about self idolization and arrogance!!\n \n \n\"We are now far enough along in the development of science to appreciate that its track record suggests that ultimately it will find natural causes for natural phenomena. God has fashioned a self-consistent reality in nature,\" pg 252 \n\n \n Again, not on page 252 - maybe you have a hardcover with slightly different page numbers than mine. But I'll belive you that it's in there somewhere. The question is, why would the same reason and evidence and conclusions lead one observer to believe that \"God has fashioned\", and another observer (Dawkins)to believe that \"blindness\" has fashioned? \n \n \nI don't think you have EVER read Finding Darwin's God. \n\n \n And I don't think that's the only thing you're wrong about. \n \n \nYou have just read people who have given false witness about it. Now, if a person willingly repeats false witness without checking for the truth, is that person also guilty of false witness? \n\n \n I suppose so, but I didn't do that. Where did you learn about false witness in science? Again, I'd like for you to show me where the detail is in that book about primary and secondary causes. \n \n \n \n \nHow? How can the human do anything about God? \n\n \n By convincing millions of readers that he doesn't exist - that a \"Blind Watchmaker\" is responsible for our existance. \n \n \n \n The only way to \"cheapen\" the teachings is to deny what God teaches us (atheist and theist alike) in His Creation. You need to read more of St. Augustine.\n\n \n St. Augustine wasn't inspired by God the same way the Biblical authors were. \n \n \n \n1. Actually, not \"many\" You can count on two hands the number that really do take on primary causes: Sagan, Wilson, Dawkins, Atkins, PZ Myers (Dennett and Provine, but they are philosphers). The vast majority of scientists who are agnostic and atheists do not engage in this. \n\n \n But they don't \"take them to task\", do they? And I don't have quite that many fingers to count the thousands and thousands of Sagan, Wilson, Dawkins, lovers and parroters that today's universities publically funded science departments are saturated with. You need to read more David Horowitz. \n \n \n2. And yes, scientists do take them to In fact, some agnostic and atheist scientists take them to task. Eugenie Scott, head of the NCSE, has done so many times. So has Michael Ruse (altho he is also a philosopher). Scientists such as Miller, and others have entered the fray. There is a book called Science Held Hostage by (theists) Van Till, Menninga, and Young that takes on scientists who step beyond the science to atheism. \n\n \n It's not making it to the NY Times front page though, is it? It's not making any headway in changing how it's taught in public schools, is it? \n \n \n3. The scientists who go beyond the bounds do not attack science. Therefore most scientist who are theists don't get involved. They have 3 main reasons: 1) they are secure enough in their own faith that they don't view what is being done as a threat, 2) since they know where science ends and faith begins, most simply filter out the religious aspects as being personal and therefore, not worth commenting on and 3) there is nothing for them to argue, as scientists. Creationism, OTOH, gets the science wrong and is a direct threat to science. \n\n \n Who makes that determination? Blind watchmaker Dawkins, or God fearing Miller? Neither of their beliefs is a threat to science? \n \n \n \nMore likely because you haven't read Miller's book. It's all there in Chapters8 and 9.\n\n \n Show me where (page numbers - if they're close I'll find them) where Miller addresses SIN in any detailed way.",

The first reference pg 14-15 has two references:\n \n \"Biologist and author Richard Dawkins once allowed his readers to consider how powerful natural selection was by asking them how many of their direct ancestors had died in childhood.\" \n \n No reference to atheism there, is there? \n\n \n LOL, no, unless you realize that he's implying that natural selection is more powerful than God!!\n \n \npage 15 \"Wilson's sentiment that Darwinian natural selection rules out God is widely shared. Richard Dawkins leaves no doubt about his own views of a Darwinian universe. It is not a place of real values, of genuine good and evil\"\n \n But now you need to go to page 17:\n \n \"A nonscientist reading the popular books of writers like these might be forgiven for jumping to the conclusion that modern evolutionary science has ruled out the existence of God. According to Williams, science certainly has ruled out the existence of a benign one.\n \"Is this indeed the case? ... Does evolution really nullify world views that depend on the spiritual? ... And does it rigorously exclude belief in God?\n \"These are the questions that I will explore in the pages that follow. My answer, in each and every case, is a resounding no. I do not say this, as you will see, because evolution is wrong. Far from it. The reason, as I hope to show, is because evolution is right. \"\n \n You didn't read the rest of the book and find the reasons for the \"no\". Some of us did read the book. \n\n \n As a Christian with a basic knowledge of the nature of God, I didn't find his reasons for the \"no\" convincing. \n \n \n \nWhat you care about is your literal interpretation of Genesis. For that to be true, then you must argue against evolution and science. Miller and I care about God. Too bad you don't.\n\n \n Ah yes, as Miller proclaimed; \n \n \n\"The irony is that only those who embrace the scientific reality of evolution are adequately prepared to give God the credit and the power that He truly deserves.\" \n\n \n But you don't bother to start a theistic evolution church, and enlighten all the unwashed masses about your supreme knowledge of God.

Provide evidence of this, or else retract your not-so-subtle insinuation.\nYes, \"'wink and nod' excrement\" was my phrase that described your presentation of how you think Dawkins and Miller interact.

Miller was wrong, and he clearly states as much. In fact, after Miller explained his reason for expecting a wink and a nod, he says, \"He did nothing of the sort. Henry Morris made it clear to me that he believed everything he had said the night before. [emphasis original]\"\n \n \nYet you don't say a word about Miller \"proving\" anything - you don't \"call him on it\".\n\n I don't have to: Miller already admitted that he was wrong.

   " My main reason for discussing this, for starting this thread, is to find out if theistic evolution contributes to an increase in atheism in the U.S. \n\n \n Theistic evolution counteracts atheism the drive to atheism that Biblical literalism causes. Biblical literalism says: believe a literal Bible or believe your own senses. Anyone is going to believe their own senses. Therefore creationism/Biblical literalism drives people away from God toward atheism. In fact, I've often wondered if Biblical literalists were not undercover atheists.\n \n \nI agree that's what they've decided, but I don't agree that theism has been forced on them. Do you think it has been forced on them, in violation of the first amendment?\n\n \n Not intentionally, but yes, forced nonetheless. As a theist, I would consider having \"there is no god to trust\" on money to be forcing atheism on me. \n \n \n I agree - but more than \"irrational\" at that time, atheism was safely ignored because it was unorganized. Not so today - it's as organized as any religion, and should have the first amendment applied to it in the same way. \n\n \n Atheism was unorganized because it was not a valid intellectual position. Advocates of slavery today aren't organized either, but that is because slavery is an untenable position.\n \n But I don't see an \"organized\" atheism. I don't see a political party advocating atheism. The closest you are going to get is the Secular Humanism Society and, perhaps, the Skeptics Socieity. Neither have large memberships and both have much larger interests than atheism.\n \n \nAtheism uses evolution as a tool, and evolution enjoys a higher profile today among lay people than ever before. Newspaper articles, television programs, magazines, school curriculums, - its atheist implications are not being as carefully separated from state as some traditional religious practices. And it shows;\n \n \n \n http://prweb.com/releases/2006/2/prweb344779.htm#\n\n \n First, the website has nothing to do with evolution. It is about churches adopting secular advertising techniques. You seem to be equating evolution with all secular, non-religious society. That's not valid.\n \n Yes, evolution has a high profile, but I don't see it associated --outside of a few militant atheists like Dawkins and Dennet -- with atheism. I've never heard of evolution being taught as atheism in public schools, even tho I've asked numerous times for examples. \n \n EVOLUTION IS NOT ATHEISM Despite the efforts of creationists like you and militant atheists like Dawkins to make it so, evolution, like all science, is agnostic.\n \n \n Why not? Why is that such a problem for theistic evolutionists? \n\n \n First, why do associate this with theistic evolution? It has nothing to do with it. I'm speaking as a theist and a citizen of the US, not as an evolutionist.\n \n Second, I told you: atheism is now a possible faith. Before there was only different versions of theism: Christianity (with its various denominations), Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, etc. So saying \"under God\" did not promote any of them. After all, it was a generic \"God\" and they all agreed God exists. But now we have a faith that God does not exist. So the government can't say \"under God\" because that is not their faith. It is the government sanctioning one faith -- theism -- over another faith.\n \n And, in fact, that is how \"under God\" got into the Pledge! The original Pledge did not have it and for over 70 years did not have the phrase. The phrase was inserted during the McCarthy era especially to distinguish the USA from atheistic Communism. The idea was that a Communist (being an atheist) could not say the Pledge. That's not right, both from the pov of the Constitution and the Great Commandment.\n \n \nThere simply isn't enough difference between atheism and agnosticism. Why don't theistic evolutionists see that?\n\n \n Because it is you who can't see the difference. Atheists try to make the difference narrower in order to try to gain epistemological legitimacy to atheism, but the reality is a huge difference. Atheism is a faith that deity does not exist. Agnosticism is a neutral position that there is insufficient data to decide whether deity exists or not.\n \n Atheists have tried to make the term \"weak atheism\" and have it be equivalent to agnosticism. Under critical examination, however, weak atheism reduces to either agnosticism or atheism.\n \n \n Have you considered that atheists you trust make up things about evolution to get theistic evolutionists on their side politically? \n\n \n Would't work. Since science works with the physical universe, anyone can go to the physical universe and check up to see whether something is \"made up\". Since I believe God created, it means I can go to God to make sure the atheists are being honest. :) \n \n \n Why are you answering questions from post #71? \n\n \n Because they are questions. \n \n \nToday's courts are recognizing more about the intent of the framers than previous generations that were closer to the actual framers? \n\n \n Yep. That's because the framers deliberately wrote a flexible document that would be general and not particular. When the particulars change, the document can cover them. When the framers talked about regulating \"interstate commerce\" they were thinking of wagons and boats. They had no idea of the internet. But they did not intend for Congress to be limited to regulating horse-drawn wagons and boats; they wanted Congress to be able to regulate internet commerce too.\n \n Just so, the framers had no idea that atheism was a rational faith. All the data they had said that atheism was irrational and could, therefore, be disregarded. But, if the situation changed, the framers didn't want theism pushed as a state religion.\n \n \nWith you, as with Kenneth Miller's book, I'm still not seeing much difference between theistic evolution and atheism.\n\n \n The log in your eye makes it difficult for you to see.",

   "Yes, that false Bible. \n\n \n That false literal interpretation of the Bible. Remember, when extrabiblical evidence shows a literal interpretation of flat earth, immovable earth passages, and Luke 2:1 to be wrong, creationists modify the interpretation. But they are inconsistent and won't modify the interpretation of Genesis 1-8. Jesus had words for people like that: hypocrites and Pharisees.\n \n \n \nBecause beliefs about God directly relate to beliefs about those things. \n\n \n How so? You made a flat assertion. Now please explain and document it.\n \n \n Beliefs in God, or lack of it, often cause immediate separation of political ideas. In the U.S. it's the belief that a Creator gives unalienable rights. The question of the existence of unalienable rights of an individual almost always includes a question of the power of government in individuals lives. \n\n \n Jefferson thought \"rights\" came from God. That's how he justified them. However, rights can be justified without the use of God.\n \n \n Many, if not most Christians don't object to the Iraq war because they believe it's a \"deterant\" from killing. American killing. If we'd have taken out Hitler as quick as we took out Hussien, fewer people would have died overall. \n\n \n \"Deterrant\" is not good enough. What you are referring to is \"self-defense\". But, in order to do that, the opponent has to present a direct threat to either you or someone else. Hussein did not do that. \n \n \nJust about any informed Christian doesn't want a Muslim victory in Iraq. \n\n \n LOL! If we turn Iraq into a stable democracy, it will be a Muslim victory because nearly all Iraqis are Muslims! No, what we don't want is a victory for Al-Queda. Not the same thing at all as \"Muslim\". Al-Queda are terrorists who just happen to be Muslim. We don't care about the Muslim part; we care about the terrorist.\n \n \n Or his position could come from an ignorance of the threat of Terrorism.\n\n \n Nope, because \"Terrorism\" is not that big a threat. Yes, they can kill people, but they can't threaten the country. They can't conqeuor us or change our form of government. No, the enemy there is the people who panic over terrrorism and, in their own personal cowardice fear of being killed, destroy America.",

   "Welcome back - you've been gone awhile. :) I've been gone about a week myself - needed a new hard drive and the time necessary to get all systems back to normal.\n\n \n There will be other gaps. Research to do, papers and grants to write. You are not my top priority. Sorry. \n \n \n There really is something in it about theistic evolution, because YOU, as a theistic evolutionist, made the statement. There are many atheists who claim to have read the Bible, and even though they reject it, they claim to be knowledgeable enough about it to proclaim that \"creationists deny God\", because \"reason and evidence\" tell them that - reason and evidence gathered from a \"there is no God\" presupposition. \n\n \n 1. My conclusion that \"creationists deny God\" came from the Bible and Christianity. Evolution had nothing to do with it. \n \n 2. I've never seen an atheist claim that \"creationists deny God\". Please quote one that has. Instead, atheists claim that the Bible is mythology and has no truth in it. I never said that nor do I agree with it. \n \n You haven't faced up to the questions: Who created? What was created? Who put the data there that science finds?\n \n \nEvolution isn't a belief? I suppose it depends on which definition of evolution we use, as there are many. Suppose some atheist scientists, behind their usual closed doors, analyze and theorize that religion is a product of the human brains evolution. Do theistic evolutionists accept that without question? Would that evolutionary discovery inspire you to completely reject theology as a quirk in your brain to be cast off, so you could be as perfect as those who were born without that quirk, like Richard Dawkins or Edward O. Wilson? \n\n \n No, evolution is not a belief. It's a scientific theory. And scientists do not analyze \"behind closed doors\". In fact, just what you speculate has been in the press in recent weeks -- which is where you got it. It is being hypothesized that religion is a product of the evolution of the human brain. I find the hypothesis unconvincing because it addresses only the sociology of religion, not the underlying question of the existence of God. Also, it ignores the hypotheses: 1) that the sociology started because a real, objectively existent God communicated with humans and 2) having a brain module capable of communicating with an objectively existent God has selection advantages and could/would evolve.\n \n \nCreationists often say that too, that God uses material processes. \n\n \n No, they don't. They have God operating only in the absence of material processes. Creationism is god-of-the-gaps theology. In fact, since creationists reject evolution as a possible means that God created, they actually say that material processes exclude God. In that regard, they are exactly like atheists.\n \n \nThe difference seems to be that creationists question the humans who represent science when they make claims that much or all of the book of Genesis is false. \n\n \n And this just shows that creationists are worshipping a book. Their god -- a literal Genesis -- is threatened.\n \n \nTheistic evolutionists seem to routinely accept human claims over Biblical claims without question. The Bible plainly warns about that, and there is no complex interpretation questions about those warnings. \n\n \n But creationists accept extrabiblical evidence over Biblical claims. For instance, no creationist says that the whole world was enrolled as it says in Luke 2:1. Where in the Bible would they get the idea that not everyone was enrolled? No, they used extrabiblical evidence to know that Japanese, Inuits, and Zulus were not enrolled. But all of that contradicts Luke 2:1.\n \n Give me the \"warnings\" and we'll see if they are as plain as you say. :) \n \n \n \nYou deleted the final sentence from my quote. This one \"Atheism doesn't bother to distinguish between the two, and neither, apparently, does theistic evolution.\" \n\n \n I left it out because it wasn't relevant. So walk me thru the \"huge difference\"\n \n \nAre sonic imaging and amniocentisis \"theories\" in the same way that things like abiogenesis and religion \"brain quirks\" are? \n\n \n Yes and no. Both are statements about the physical universe. That is what a theory/hypothesis is. Now, theories/hypotheses come in 3 subgroups:\n 1. Untested.\n 2. Supported.\n 3. Falsified.\n \n Sonic imaging, amniocentesis, and abiogenesis are strongly supported theories. Not just \"supported\", but strongly supported. The first 2 are so strongly supported that they are regarded as (provisionally) fact. I think abiogenesis is in that same category, but many disagree with me. The new hypotheses on religion being a product only of the brain are mostly untested.\n \n \n Yes I know, gravity is a theory too. Sonic imaging, gravity, religious brain quirks - there are many other \"theories\" atheists try to compare and confuse with their philosophy to try to make them indistinguishable. As a theistic evolutionlist, Miller doesn't seem to mind. \n\n \n Some militant atheists are trying to make the religious brain quirks sound more supported than it is. Since we don't have Miller's comments on those theories, you can't honestly say \"Miller doesn't seem to mind\". That's false witness. Miller, and I, do not object to strongly supported theories like evolution, quantum mechanics, natural selection, etc. There's no point. God has spoken and it's hopeless to argue with Him. I've already noted my scientific objections to the new hypotheses on the origin of religion. I'll wait for more data before making a final decision.\n \n \n\"Creationists deny God\"....\"Creationism denies Christian theology\" - atheist proclamations that you have thus far failed to back up.\n\n \n Those are Christian proclamations. And yes, I have backed them up. You simply have ignored what I've said.\n \n \nMy interpretation tells me they ARE Biblical, and plenty of credentialed Christian theologians agree with me. Your interpretation tells you that they are non Biblical, and you have plenty of atheist company. \n\n \n So name some. Name the Biblical verses. I can name a few of my own: Elaine Pagels, Rev. Gregory Neal. Also, go look at Job. Satan isn't God's adversary there. He's God's betting buddy. He is an \"adversary\", but in Hebrew that means he's the prosecuting attorney for humans. He's working on God's side and on God's behalf.\n \n \nTheistic evolution doesn't seem to fall anywhere near the halfway point between creation and atheism, does it?\n\n \n You just confused two terms: creation and creationism. Theistic evolution is on the side of creation. Where did you get the idea that theistic evolution was supposed to be \"halfway\" between creationism and atheism? That's absurd. \n \n [quote]You've indicated that you believe the Bible to be a \"false idol\". From the \"help me out here\" thread;\n \n \"But you cannot believe in a god of a literal inerrant Bible and accept evolution. However, as a Christian I don't have any problem with that. After all, if your god is a literal inerrant Bible you are worshipping a false idol. \"\n \n Read what I wrote. Marc, seriously, this discussion goes better if your reading comprehension is up to standard. I never said \"the Bible is a false idol\". Instead, I said a literal inerrant Bible . The Bible is not God. \"literal inerrant\" refers to a human way to read the Bible. It's not the way the Bible is meant to be read, as told us by Jesus, Paul, and God. \n \n \n Lucaspa: I don't agree with a literal interpreation of that part of scripture, but then scripture itself tells me not to take it literally. \n \n Chapter and verse? \n\n \n I was referring to Genesis 1-3. If I take it literally, Genesis 1 contradicts with Genesis 2-3. So, the text itself tells us that a literal interpretation is not correct. Truth cannot contradict truth (that's a basic Christian doctrine). \n \n \nEach Christian denomination has varying views of what is \"literal\" and how it's to be applied to everyday life. All that can get complicated, but the simple fact that theistic evolution doesn't seem concerned enough about it to define it's beliefs through it's own denomination makes one wonder how concerned it really is about theisim - how it's followers seem to be content to do the same things on Sunday mornings that atheists do.\n\n \n First, you skipped the point! I said \"Sorry, a literal interpretation of the Bible is not \"God's word\". That you think so shows how much you do not worship God.\" A literal interpreation is just a human idea.\n \n Second, theistic evolutionists DON'T do the same things on Sunday mornings that atheists do. They go to church. If you are Rev. McCosh, you LEAD worship services. Atheists never do that.\n \n Second, why do you think theistic evolution needs its own denomination? There are no applications of theistic evolution in everyday life. Believing God used the processes discovered by science says nothing about whether we are saved by grace alone or whether we need works. It says nothing about whether you should say \"trespasses\" or \"debts\" in the Lord's prayer or what type of church governance you like.\n \n \n\"Fundies believe like atheists\" - interesting. Atheists often use the somewhat derogatory term \"fundies\". You use it too, yet you seem to have no derogatory term for atheists. \n\n \n You didn't quote the whole sentence! \"Fundies believe like atheists: if there are material causes, then God is absent.\"\n \n You never bothered to deny the truth of that. You can't. After all, you think that evolution means God is absent. Yet that is just what atheists think! I can see why you want to try to distract the issue from the similarity of creationism and atheism, but you can't hide or run from it.\n \n BTW, I don't need to use \"Fundies\" as derogatory term -- Fundamentalists is just as derogatory. \"Fundie\" just happens to be shorter. The atheist equivalent of Fundies are \"militant atheists\". \n \n \n \n Lucaspa \"We accept what God says. You say \"nature\" is something that doesn't have God in it. \"\n \n Where did I say that? All Christianity sees God in nature. \n\n \n Evolution and abiogenesis don't have God in them, do they? According to you, that is. You don't allow God to create by \"natural\" processes, do you?\n \n \n Lucaspa: \"But who created nature? God, right? Therefore, nature is something God wrote. OTOH, humans wrote scripture. Even more, a literal interpretation is done by humans. So, when we have something God did vs something humans say about God, Miller and I choose God.\"\n \n But you and Miller are humans too. Very convienient how you can make God whatever you want him to be. \n\n \n No, we can't. The universe is what it IS, not what Miller and I want it to be. We find out what the universe really is. Which means we are finding out how God really created, not trying to tell God how He created, like creationists do. And if Miller and I are wrong, God (the physical universe) will tell us. Who tells you that your literal interpretation of the Bible is wrong? Well, God in the text and God in creation, but you don't listen to God. \n \n \nWho is Calvin?\n\n \n John Calvin. Major Christian theologian, contemporary of Martin Luther, one of the founders of Protestantism in general and the Reformed Tradition in particular. Are you that ignorant of Christian theology and history that you don't recognize the name Calvin? Guess so. Even more evidence that you are not a Christian.\n \n \n And you seem to be saying that personal beliefs influencing science are the exception rather than the rule. I have a different view about human frailty - I'm learning how theistic evolution undermines the basic way of reading the Bible, and how it makes sin largely meaningless. The reality of sin is basic in theology. \n\n \n 1. Yes, because whatever our personal beliefs, we still have to test our ideas against God's Creation. God doesn't care about our personal beliefs. He is Truth.\n \n 2. The \"basic\" way of reading the Bible is NOT your way. You don't even use the \"basic way\" most of the time.\n \n 3. How does it make sin meaningless. Actually, evolution explains sin and why we all sin. Sin is an inevitable by-product of how God created us. Genesis 2-3 explained sin in theological terms. Evolution gives the biological basis and why all humans sin.\n \n I have to go now. I'll do the rest some other time. This is probably enough to set you frothing at the mouth as it is. Don't want to give you a coronary.",

   "No, evolution is not a belief. It's a scientific theory. And scientists do not analyze \"behind closed doors\". In fact, just what you speculate has been in the press in recent weeks -- which is where you got it. It is being hypothesized that religion is a product of the evolution of the human brain. I find the hypothesis unconvincing because it addresses only the sociology of religion, not the underlying question of the existence of God. Also, it ignores the hypotheses: 1) that the sociology started because a real, objectively existent God communicated with humans and 2) having a brain module capable of communicating with an objectively existent God has selection advantages and could/would evolve.\n\n I hope you won't mind my butting in.\n \n You appear to be suggesting that we are offered a choice between two possible explanations of humankind's drive to believe in the supernatural and numinous: 1) the Wilson/Dawkins/Wolpert view, that such beliefs, even though without objective foundation, conferred adaptive value on populations that developed them and were selected accordingly; and 2) that the beliefs conferred adaptive value because they allowed communication with an objectively existent deity.\n \n Since the adaptive value is real and tangible either way, Occam's razor suggests we should accept the simpler version - the one without the objectively existent god. Why add a superfluous factor to an already complete hypothesis?",

   "There are only two references to Sagan in the index, pages 194 and 221. Trying page 194 first, we find that quote! Now read what I said again; ...My point in quoting it was that it was a Godless, secular paragraph that Sagan as an atheist proclaimed, and Miller as a theistic evolutionist heartily agrees with. The paragraph covered amemia, polio, etc, but left out abortion, embryonic stem cell research etc. Another coincidence? \n\n \n The chapter is entitled \"Beyond Materialism\". You have not read the book, because you are ignoring the context and the argument. Let's go back to page 191, the end of the last chapter. Miller is talking about Lewontin's famous Lewontin quote \"To appeal to an omnipotent deity is to allow that at any moment the regularities of nature may be ruptured, that miracles may happen.\" As I said, Lewontin was being sarcastic in that quote and criticizing Sagan's philosophical materialism. But Miller decides to take it seriously.\n \n \"But Lewontin has misssed something, something important. What if the regularities of nature were fashioned in a way that they themselves allowed for the divine? What if the logical connections he makes between materialism and atheism are flawed? What if the very foundations that sem to lock evolution and religion into conflict were built upon suspect ground? In other words, what if the gods of disbelief were false?\"\n \n The next 2 chapters is where Miller answers those questions on the side of theism.\n \n Now, after the Sagan quote on page 94, you need to read the context of the rest of the chapter. Miller goes on to describe classical physics and the implications of that \n \n \"Science has shown that material mechanisms, not spirits, were behind the reality of nature. ... Could there be anything left for God to do?\"\n \n Miller spends the rest of the chapter showing \"yes, there is\". He describes classical physics and the implications for deism. He then describes quantum mechanics and spends a lot of time showing its implications for theism.\n \n pg 201 \"there is a pattern to these uncertainties [at the quantum level], and those patterns account for the fact that the universe seems pretty orderly to us. Although we cannot predict the outcomes of individual events with any certainty, the overall outcomes of thousands of such events fall into very predictable patterns.\"\n \n But what you really want is on page 213:\n \"Committed atheists like Richard Dawkins would attack with ridicule any suggestion that room for the work of a Deity can be found in the physical nature of reality. But Dawkins' personal skepticism no more disproves the existence of God than the creationists' incredulity is an argument against evolution. What matters is the straightforward, factuazl, strictly scientific recognition that matter in the universe behaves in such a way that we can never achieve complete knowledge of any fragment of it, and life itself is structured in a way that allows biological history to pivot directly on these tiny uncertainties. That ought to allow even the most critical scientist to admit that the breaks in causality at the atomic level make it fundamentally impossible to exclude the idea that what we have really caught a glimpse of might indeed reflect the mind of God.\"\n \n \n Miller , on pp 214-215, is talking about you, Marc: \n \"Ironically, anti-evolutionists, just like the extreme materialists, seem to work in an intellectual world uninformed by modern physics. To their way of thinking, scientific materialism necessarily implies a complete, causal, mechanistic description of natural reality. They have seen the profound success of biology in providing material explanations for the nature of life, and they are worried. ...\n \"see each new materialist, scientific explanation for a natural phenomenon as a retreat for the primacy of God. ... In this respect, they are the unlikely and unwitting allies of vigorous atheists like Dawkins, Provine, and Lewontin who would agree enthusiastically that a complete success for materialistic science condemns any search for God to ultimate failure.\"\n \n Miller doesn't agree with you and Dawkins, Marc. \n \n You can see why and how in the section \"A Science of Belief\". Read it, Marc. And then read chapter 8 \"The Road Back Home\". Try the first paragraph on page 243.\n \n You seem concerned that Sagan did not mention ES cell research, abortion, and other unnamed things. First, while mouse ES cells were isolated in 1970, it was not until 1998 that human ES cells were isolated and cultured. So there was no ES cell \"debate\" when Sagan wrote Demon Haunted Woodland. Nor is there any uncertainty in how to isolate and culture ES cells.\n \n The abortion issue is not a scientific one. Yes, abortions are doable and safe. Pregnancies can be safely (for the mother) terminated at any stage. But I see no reason for Sagan to mention that. Sagan was talking about treatments and diagnostic techniques. There are thousands of them, all as reliable as amniocentesis and the ones Sagan mentioned. He couldn't list them all.\n \n \nThe Bible was written over a period of fourteen hundred years, over forty generations, by over forty authors, from all walks of life, written on three continents. There are many things in it that I don't like. But since I'm not God, it's not my call to twist it to suit myself.\n\n \n But you DO twist the Bible to suit yourself. That's what we've seen in all your posts. You admit it was written over a 1400 year period, but you never consider what it meant to the people at the time a particular book was written. All you are concerned about is what you want the Bible to mean, not what it actually means.\n \n Since you don't think God talks to you, yes, you do set the Bible up as your false idol and worship it. You can't stand any possibility that it's not 100% accurate.\n \n \nWhat's the difference between material causes and secondary causes? \n\n \n You were labeling some primary causes as secondary causes, i.e, the formation of the universe. You were also saying that God zapping the first cell was a secondary cause. The term \"secondary cause\" refers to the material causes. \n \n Atheists don't believe material causes are \"secondary causes\" because they don't believe there is a deity to use material causes. For theists, the material causes discovered by science are the secondary causes God used to create. Does that clear up the confusion for you?\n \n \n\"Live and let live\", by helping atheists \"separate church and state\", and politically fight creationists every step of the way? Do you think atheists are being discriminated against in the U.S.? \n\n \n Fighting creationists is helping theism. Creationism is the most destructive idea to hit Christianity since the Manichean and Gnostic heresies -- and creationism invokes both of those!\n \n Yes, I think the US government does have remnants of an unintentional, but still unfair establishment of theism as a religion. \n \n \nAnd God speaks to you through evolution, the same evolution that atheists use to proclaim that there is no God?\n\n \n God speaks thru His Creation. Christianity has always held that God has \"two books\". One is Creation. So what if atheists proclaim evolution shows God does not exist? Does that make them right? NO! They are not right about that. Anymore than creationists are right that God created by creationism.\n \n \n A general concensus from all around the internet puts the percentages of atheistic biological scientists in the high 90's.\n\n \n Sorry, but the data from scientific studies disproves that. Witham and Larson's survey was half from biological fields and they got 40% of all scientists are theists -- by a very conservative definition. That is not possible if 90% of biologists are atheists.\n \n Also, Gould is adamant that at least 50% of evolutionary biologists are theists. The \"consensus\" is by atheists trying to cook the data. Why do you believe them?\n \n \nCan you or Mr. Johnson explain why Richard Dawkins book, The BLIND watchmaker, sold so well? Apparently, millions of book readers prove Mr. Johnson wrong, don't they? \n\n \n Nearly all of The Blind Watchmaker discusses the reality and mechanism of evolution. Dawkins references to religion amount to about 5 sentences in the book. Evolution is a fascinating topic, which is why the book sold so well.\n \n And no, the popularity of the book has nothing to do with Johnson being right or wrong. Johnson wasn't denying that Dawkins was correct about the effect of evolution on atheism. Dawkins is correct on that. Evolution by natural selection made atheism, for the first time, a rational faith. But it by no means makes it obligatory to be an atheist. That is also correct.\n \n \nIf half his colleagues can't see how Dawkins, Wilson, Dennett, Lewontin, Sagan, Gould, and many other prominent atheist evolutionists affect politics, they really are enormously stupid.\n\n \n Gould wasn't discussing politics. Here, let me give you the sentence you apparently can't read for yourself:\n \n \"Either half my colleagues are enormously stupid, or else the science of Darwinism is fully compatible with conventional religious beliefs\" The data show that evolution is not atheistic but is compatible with theism. \n \n \nHe can show \"God to intervene\", Miller can heap praise on him, and he and allllllllll theistic evolutionists can chuckle about together, can't they? \n\n \n Why aren't you chuckling? Don't you find it amusing that such a militant atheist who claims evolution absolutely excludes God can write of a method where God can influence evolution and not be detected?\n \n Oh, that's right. It destroys your vision of Dawkins as the devil and totally against religion. \n \n \nI can't find that statement - it's NOT ON page 252. I don't remember seeing the word \"secondary\" anywhere in the book. It may have been in there, but I'd like for you to show me where there was a detailed description . \n It was on page 255. Is all theistic evolution this precise? ... You got that page number right!! \n\n \n It's page 252, in the middle of the page. I just re-checked. I think you made a mistake in looking at page numbers. Before you try to get too self-righteous, you might remember the parable on dust motes, logs, and eyes.\n \n I never claimed Miller made a \"detailed description of \"primary\" and \"secondary\" causes\". You are making a strawman. I simply claimed that Miller discussed what are, in other terms, secondary causes.\n \n \nAnd this one from the same page, if you wouldn't have quoted it, I sure would have!! So only evolutionists, not Bible scholars, are capable of giving God credit and power!! \n\n \n 1. Miller didn't say that what you said. Miller said \"\"The irony is that only those who embrace the scientific reality of evolution are adequately prepared to give God the credit and the power that He truly deserves.\" Now, Bible scholars can embrace evolution. And those who deny evolution can still give God \"credit and power\", but not what \"He truly deserves\". IOW, creationists fall short of giving God the appropriate credit.\n \n 2. You and Biblical literalists are not \"Bible scholars\". \n \n \n \nAgain, not on page 252 - maybe you have a hardcover with slightly different page numbers than mine. But I'll belive you that it's in there somewhere. The question is, why would the same reason and evidence and conclusions lead one observer to believe that \"God has fashioned\", and another observer (Dawkins)to believe that \"blindness\" has fashioned? \n\n \n 1. I made a typo mistake on the page number.\n \n 2. Because Dawkins and Miller have different evidence. Part of that is evidence within science. As Miller shows, Dawkins is not considering the effect of quantum mechanics. He is basing his argument on science and God on the deterministic view of the 19th century. But the major part of the difference in evidence is evidence from outside science. The real evidence for theism does not come from science. It's rooted in personal experience that lies outside science. Miller (and I) trust the personal experience of the people in the Bible. Not a literal reading, but the general and essential claims: God spoke to Moses and engineered the Exodus, God communicated with David, Solomon, and helped Israel, Jesus lived, died, and was Resurrected, Paul had a genuine experience on the road to Damascus, etc. Miller may also have personal experience of God; he doesn't say so outright because it is not appropriate to this book. \n \n Dawkins doesn't have personal experience of God and Dawkins doesn't accept the accounts of other people, including those in the Bible.\n \n I don't think I'm wrong about your not reading the book. I think you skimmed the book to find passages that supported your preconceived viewpoint. You supported my theory when you said \"And this one from the same page, if you wouldn't have quoted it, I sure would have\". If you'd known about the quote, you would have used it. I don't think you found it until I made you read the page searching for the quote I posted.\n \n [quote] Lucaspa: \"How? How can the human do anything about God?\"\n \n By convincing millions of readers that he doesn't exist - that a \"Blind Watchmaker\" is responsible for our existance.\"\n \n ROFL! And that is going to make a difference \"about\" God? You really think God is going to disappear if a few millions of readers decide not to believe in Him? Do you think He will stop loving people as much? All I can say is that your god is very trivial. I'm so very glad that God is not like that at all.\n \n \nSt. Augustine wasn't inspired by God the same way the Biblical authors were. \n\n \n How do you know? But even so, that isn't saying Augustine is wrong, is it? So, your comment is irrelevant. Besides, you haven't read Augustine, have you? This is just an excuse not to look up something that shows your arguments to be wrong. :) \n \n \n \nBut they don't \"take them to task\", do they?\n\n \n Please, read all my response before you start to post. As you found out, Dawkins and company are \"taken to task\"\n \n \n And I don't have quite that many fingers to count the thousands and thousands of Sagan, Wilson, Dawkins, lovers and parroters that today's universities publically funded science departments are saturated with. You need to read more David Horowitz. \n\n \n What specifically of Horowitz do you want me to read? I haven't encountered these \"thousands and thousands\" in my 30 years in university science departments. Or at meetings. The overwhelming majority of scientists keep their personal beliefs to themselves. \n \n \nIt's not making it to the NY Times front page though, is it? It's not making any headway in changing how it's taught in public schools, is it? \n\n \n 1. The scientists have no control whether their comments make it to the NY Times frontpage. By this complaint you admit that your idea is falsified. BTW, part of Scott's \"taking to task\" was published in the scientifically prestigious \"New York Academy of Science\" journal\n \n 2. You need to document that evolution is being taught as atheism in public schools. This is a continual complaint by creartionists but, despite my repeated requests, not one can document a case.\n \n And yes, Eugenie Scott's complaint did change how evolution was defined by the BSC for public school science teachers. \n \n \" In late 1995, the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) issued a statement to its members and the public concerning the importance of evolution to biology teaching. Part of the statement defined evolution:\n \n The diversity of life on earth is the result of evolution: an unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable and natural process of temporal descent with genetic modification that is affected by natural selection, chance, historical contingencies and changing environments.\n \n Shortly after this statement appeared, I began to see letters to the editor from around the country decrying the \"atheism\" of the NABT. Anti-evolutionists like Phillip Johnson included broadsides against NABT in their writings. As one Christian said to me, defining evolution as \"unsupervised\" and \"impersonal\" implied to many Americans that \"God had nothing to do with it and life has no meaning.\" Reflecting these public concerns, two distinguished theologians, Cornell's Huston Smith and Notre Dame's Alvin Plantinga, wrote a polite letter to NABT's board of directors, asking it to delete the two words \"unsupervised\" and \"impersonal\".They specifically noted that the use of the two words \"has two unfortunate and unin tended consequences. It gives aid and comfort to extremists in the religious right for whom it provides a legitimate target. And because of its logical vulnerability; it lowers Americans' respect for scientists and their place in our culture.\"\n When the NABT's board convened at its annual meeting in Minneapolis in October 1997, members' initial reaction was that creationists were trying to get them to change the statement, and they weren't about to knuckle under to that sort of pressure. They voted at the end of a 9-hour meeting, after only a brief discussion, not to change the statement.\n Why is this story relevant to my receiving this award? You may be surprised to hear that after I arrived at the NABT meeting, I encouraged the board to do as the theologians asked and drop \"unsupervised\" and \"impersonal\". I'm pleased to say that the board did discuss the issue at greater length and ultimately altered the statement by dropping the two words.\"\n \n \nWho makes that determination? Blind watchmaker Dawkins, or God fearing Miller? Neither of their beliefs is a threat to science? \n\n \n Both Miller and Dawkins agree that creationism is a threat to science. So do all scientists, of whatever worldview. Miller's beliefs are certainly not a threat to science. Atheism, per se, is also not a threat to science. However, Dawkins' attempts to get science to \"prove\" his belief is true is a threat to science.\n \n \n Show me where (page numbers - if they're close I'll find them) where Miller addresses SIN in any detailed way.\n\n \n The \"detail\" you were initially referring to was \"secondary causes\" and science being compatible and supporting theism. That is done in detail in Chapters 7 and 8. \n \n \"The God of the Bible, even the God of Genesis, is a Deity fully consistent with what we know of the scientific reality of the modern world ... What we have learned from science explains, for the first time in human history, how God could have solved the the overpowering logical problems of His divine nature by creating for us a distinctive world of meaning and sustance.\" pg 258\n \n \"To some, the murderous reality of human nature is proof that God is absent or dead. The same reasoning would find God missing from the unpredictable fits and turns of an evolutionary tree. But the truth is deeper. In each case, a Deity determined to establish a world that was truly independent of His whims, a world in which intelligent creatures would face authentic choices between good and evil, would have to fashion a distinct, material reality and then let His creation run. Neither the self-sufficiency or nature nor the reality of evil in the world mean God is absent. To a religious person, both signify something quite different -- the strength of God's love and the reality of our freedom as His creatures.\" pg 269\n \n You seem to be acknowledging that, because you are now introducing a new topic: whether Miller discusses sin. I don't see the relevance. Please walk me thru why you think this is critical.\n \n Miller doesn't say the word \"sin\" as far as I can see, but he does talk about it indirectly when he talks about \"grace\".\n \n \"There is no scientific way to describe the spiritual concept of grace, which makes it less than real to an absolute materialist. To a believer, grace is as real as the presence of God Himself. Do Darwin's revelations -- the discoveries that locate the sources of human passions in survival mechanisms -- contradict the reality of grace? Not in the least. To a believer, grace is a gift from God that enables us to place our lives in their proper context -- not by denying our biological heritage, but by using it in His service.\" pg 280.\n \n \n .",

   "Theistic evolution counteracts atheism the drive to atheism that Biblical literalism causes. Biblical literalism says: believe a literal Bible or believe your own senses. Anyone is going to believe their own senses. \n\n \n But they're going to be able to put their own senses in proper perspective, if they know what Proverbs 3: 5,6 says. \n \n \n Therefore creationism/Biblical literalism drives people away from God toward atheism. In fact, I've often wondered if Biblical literalists were not undercover atheists. \n\n \n Practically no one is a 100% Biblical literalist. If there was, we'd be seeing some people walking around with no eyes, or hands. (Matthew 5: 29,30) There are always different degrees to Biblical literalism, and that literalism applies to two different things - the historical aspect, and the behavior aspect. \n \n \n \nNot intentionally, but yes, forced nonetheless. As a theist, I would consider having \"there is no god to trust\" on money to be forcing atheism on me. \n\n \n So having \"In God We Trust\" is forcing religion, having \"There is no god to trust\" is forcing atheism, and the solution is to simply say nothing about God? Maybe it works with money, but it doesn't work for many other things, including politics and science. Often, the complete presence of God, or the complete absence of God are the only two considerations.\n \n \n \nAtheism was unorganized because it was not a valid intellectual position. Advocates of slavery today aren't organized either, but that is because slavery is an untenable position. \n\n \n I don't think history, compared to current events, shows a change in the intellectual position of atheism. There are only two reasons it is more organized today. 1) Government is much bigger and more corrupt (affected by special interests) and 2) communications are infinitely better today. Check out this statement;\n \n \nIt has been the error of the schools to teach astronomy, and all the other sciences, and subjects of natural philosophy, as accomplishments only; whereas they should be taught theologically, or with reference to the Being who is the author of them: for all the principles of science are of divine origin. Man cannot make, or invent, or contrive principles: he can only discover them; and he ought to look through the discovery to the Author.\" \n \" The evil that has resulted from the error of the schools, in teaching natural philosophy as an accomplishment only, has been that of generating in the pupils a species of atheism. Instead of looking through the works of creation to the Creator himself, they stop short, and employ the knowledge they acquire to create doubts of his existence. They labour with studied ingenuity to ascribe every thing they behold to innate properties of matter, and jump over all the rest by saying, that matter is eternal.\" \"The Existence of God--1810\" \n\n \n Looks like someone thought atheism was a valid intellectual position 200+ years ago. Times often don't change as much as we think they do. \n \n \n \n \n \nBut I don't see an \"organized\" atheism. I don't see a political party advocating atheism. \n\n \n I do - the Democrat pary. \n \n \nThe closest you are going to get is the Secular Humanism Society and, perhaps, the Skeptics Socieity. Neither have large memberships and both have much larger interests than atheism. \n\n \n Have you ever heard of George Soros? He's personally given $5 billion to promote atheism around the world, much of it in U.S. politics. How about Progressive Insurance? They didn't just pull the name \"progressive\" out of thin air - they gave $8.5 million to the ACLU. \n \n \n \nFirst, the website has nothing to do with evolution. It is about churches adopting secular advertising techniques. \n\n \n It's mainly about declining church attendence. You don't think there's a chance that \"natural selection\" and all it's associated theories has anything to do with that?\n \n \n You seem to be equating evolution with all secular, non-religious society. That's not valid. \n\n \n You see much more neutrality in secular society than I do. It seems that you don't have much interest in politics. \n \n \nYes, evolution has a high profile, but I don't see it associated --outside of a few militant atheists like Dawkins and Dennet -- with atheism. I've never heard of evolution being taught as atheism in public schools, even tho I've asked numerous times for examples. \n\n \n There is no hard, defining line that determines when it definitely is / definitely is not being taught. It is implied - I take that implication that it is taught and you take it as innocent neutrality. Again, I'm not much of a believer in neutrality considering this country's two party political system. This two party political system isn't mandated, it fell into place naturally by human nature - imperfect human nature. \n \n \n \n \nEVOLUTION IS NOT ATHEISM Despite the efforts of creationists like you and militant atheists like Dawkins to make it so, evolution, like all science, is agnostic. \n\n \n The formal debate proposition is waiting for you. \n \n \nNo longer can the state by basically theist and just have separation of the state from particular versions of theism. \n \n [marc9000] Why not? Why is that such a problem for theistic evolutionists?\n\n \n \n \nFirst, why do associate this with theistic evolution? It has nothing to do with it. I'm speaking as a theist and a citizen of the US, not as an evolutionist. \n\n \n Because it's a recent, non traditional atheist claim. As a theist, why do you insist that the state has no right to be theist? Why is this (recent, according to you) atheist faith so important to you? \n \n \n \nSecond, I told you: atheism is now a possible faith. Before there was only different versions of theism: Christianity (with its various denominations), Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, etc. So saying \"under God\" did not promote any of them. After all, it was a generic \"God\" and they all agreed God exists. But now we have a faith that God does not exist. So the government can't say \"under God\" because that is not their faith. It is the government sanctioning one faith -- theism -- over another faith. \n\n \n Again, I don't see a big change in the feasability of atheism from 200 years ago to today. There have been recent new scientific discoveries (the complexity of life for example) that can make atheism harder to believe today than it was in previous generations. \n \n \nAnd, in fact, that is how \"under God\" got into the Pledge! The original Pledge did not have it and for over 70 years did not have the phrase. The phrase was inserted during the McCarthy era especially to distinguish the USA from atheistic Communism. The idea was that a Communist (being an atheist) could not say the Pledge. That's not right, both from the pov of the Constitution and the Great Commandment. \n\n \n How about the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial, the U.S. Capitol building, other federal property where references to God weren't \"inserted\" - they've been there all along. Should they be erased, since atheism is now a recently established faith? \n \n \n \nBecause it is you who can't see the difference. Atheists try to make the difference narrower in order to try to gain epistemological legitimacy to atheism, but the reality is a huge difference. Atheism is a faith that deity does not exist. Agnosticism is a neutral position that there is insufficient data to decide whether deity exists or not.\n \n Atheists have tried to make the term \"weak atheism\" and have it be equivalent to agnosticism. Under critical examination, however, weak atheism reduces to either agnosticism or atheism. \n\n \n The part I highlighted shows why I can't see the difference. When \"agnostics\" like Stephen Jay Gould (or several posters on these forums) blast religion in exactly the same way that atheists do, it makes it even harder to tell the difference. It's a thing called logic. \n \n \n \nWould't work. Since science works with the physical universe, anyone can go to the physical universe and check up to see whether something is \"made up\". \n\n \n Anyone? Anyone can recreate and observe complex lab experiments - look through the Hubble telescope with their own eyes, or travel to Ellesmere Island, Canada and see the Tiktaalik Roseae? During the 40 years that the Piltdown Man remains were widely believed to be genuine, and were kept locked in a vault, could \"anyone\" see them?\n \n \n \nSince I believe God created, it means I can go to God to make sure the atheists are being honest. :) \n\n \n How do you \"go to God\" without a literal belief in history as written in the Bible? If the Bible is not literal, then there isn't just one non-literal interpretation, there are many. Suppose we have the statement \"Joe walked from point A to point B. A literal interpretation would be \"Joe walked from point A to point B\". But if it's not literal, then it could possibly mean a lot of things. Joe may have gone from point A to point B in a car, or a train, or a plane or a bus or a skateboard. Or Joe may have walked to point C. Or gone to point C in some way besides walking. Or Joe may not have moved. Or Joe may not exist. If you \"go to God\" without a literal Bible, and another theistic evolutionist goes to God without a literal Bible, and you disagree on the non literal subject, how do you determine who is right? If you're talking about \"going to God\" through science, how come more scientists aren't theistic evolutionists?\n \n \n \n \nBecause they are questions. \n\n \n Questions for non-theists. \n \n \n \nYep. That's because the framers deliberately wrote a flexible document that would be general and not particular. When the particulars change, the document can cover them. When the framers talked about regulating \"interstate commerce\" they were thinking of wagons and boats. They had no idea of the internet. But they did not intend for Congress to be limited to regulating horse-drawn wagons and boats; they wanted Congress to be able to regulate internet commerce too.\n \n Just so, the framers had no idea that atheism was a rational faith. All the data they had said that atheism was irrational and could, therefore, be disregarded. But, if the situation changed, the framers didn't want theism pushed as a state religion. \n\n \n So atheists believe the situation has changed, and its time to spend taxpayer money to erase the references to God that have existed in the public square for 200 years. Why are theistic evolutionists so anxious to help them? \n \n \n \n \nThe log in your eye makes it difficult for you to see.\n\n \n No logs, just your posts.",

   "That false literal interpretation of the Bible. Remember, when extrabiblical evidence shows a literal interpretation of flat earth, immovable earth passages, and Luke 2:1 to be wrong, creationists modify the interpretation. \n\n \n It's not extrabiblical evidence, its an atheist worldview. Let's look at Luke 2:1;\n \n \nKing James\n And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. \n\n \n \nNIV\n In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. \n\n \n Is the absence of the word \"Roman\" in the King James enough to make it false? Atheists, desperate to find anything wrong with the Bible that they can, think so. So do theistic evolutionists, apparantly. \n \n The earth \"moves\" but it's still immovable by man. Common sense tells us that's what it meant. But of course if you believe it's wrong because the earth does actually move, then you can throw out the assertion that it's immovable by man, and allow Al Gore to convince you that he can control its temperature, if he's given enough political power. See how Biblical non-literalism can quickly change political views? \n \n \n \nBut they are inconsistent and won't modify the interpretation of Genesis 1-8. Jesus had words for people like that: hypocrites and Pharisees.\n\n \n Jesus discussed modifying the words of the Bible? \n \n \nQuote:\n What you are not doing, Marc, is distinguishing beliefs about God from beliefs about social justice, morality, economics, politics, etc. \n \n \n Because beliefs about God directly relate to beliefs about those things. \n\n \n \n \nHow so? You made a flat assertion. Now please explain and document it. \n\n \n In social justice, morality, economics, and politics, the message of the Ten Commandments is very often what divides opinions. Personal behavior, God in the Public square, redistribution of wealth, abortion, etc. Why do theistic evolutionists side with atheists on these things? Are the 10 commandments as wrong as the Genesis creation story?\n \n \n \nJefferson thought \"rights\" came from God. That's how he justified them. However, rights can be justified without the use of God.\n\n \n Thank you - another example. Atheists agree with you / most creationists do not. \n \n \n \n\"Deterrant\" is not good enough. What you are referring to is \"self-defense\". But, in order to do that, the opponent has to present a direct threat to either you or someone else. Hussein did not do that. \n\n \n Thank you - another example. Atheists agree with you / most creationists do not. \n \n \n \nLOL! If we turn Iraq into a stable democracy, it will be a Muslim victory because nearly all Iraqis are Muslims! No, what we don't want is a victory for Al-Queda. Not the same thing at all as \"Muslim\". Al-Queda are terrorists who just happen to be Muslim. We don't care about the Muslim part; we care about the terrorist. \n\n \n You are absolutely right about that. I used the wrong word. I sometimes tend to confuse the two terms \"Muslim\" and \"terrorist\". \n \n \n \nNope, because \"Terrorism\" is not that big a threat. Yes, they can kill people, but they can't threaten the country. They can't conqeuor us or change our form of government. No, the enemy there is the people who panic over terrrorism and, in their own personal cowardice fear of being killed, destroy America.\n\n \n Thank you - another example. Atheists agree with you / most creationists do not.",

   "1. My conclusion that \"creationists deny God\" came from the Bible and Christianity. Evolution had nothing to do with it. \n\n \n Your non-literal interpretation of the Bible. Either Joe walked from point A to point B, (literal)or Joe did not walk from point A to point B. (non literal) No fuzzy middle ground, no room for human error? \n \n \n2. I've never seen an atheist claim that \"creationists deny God\". Please quote one that has. Instead, atheists claim that the Bible is mythology and has no truth in it. I never said that nor do I agree with it. \n\n \n When it comes to blasting creationists, there are more similarities than differences among atheists and theistic evolutionists. \n \n \n \nYou haven't faced up to the questions: Who created? What was created? Who put the data there that science finds?\n\n \n Where did this outburst come from? The God who gives us free will about whether we choose to love him and accept his free gift or not. \n \n \n \nNo, evolution is not a belief. It's a scientific theory. And scientists do not analyze \"behind closed doors\". In fact, just what you speculate has been in the press in recent weeks -- which is where you got it. It is being hypothesized that religion is a product of the evolution of the human brain. I find the hypothesis unconvincing because it addresses only the sociology of religion, not the underlying question of the existence of God. Also, it ignores the hypotheses: 1) that the sociology started because a real, objectively existent God communicated with humans and 2) having a brain module capable of communicating with an objectively existent God has selection advantages and could/would evolve. \n\n \n I'll be watching for a new thread soon, which has you and the atheists here insulting each other about this subject. :p \n \n \n \n \nNo, they don't. They have God operating only in the absence of material processes. Creationism is god-of-the-gaps theology. \n\n \n The Bible has many references to a God who is involved in all minute details of individual human life. You seem to assign things to creationists that aren't really there. Just like atheists do. \n \n \n In fact, since creationists reject evolution as a possible means that God created, they actually say that material processes exclude God. In that regard, they are exactly like atheists. \n\n \n Who told you that creationists reject all evolution, or that they say material processes exclude God? Militant atheists, right? And you believe them?\n \n \n \n \nAnd this just shows that creationists are worshipping a book. Their god -- a literal Genesis -- is threatened. \n\n \n Only in your imagination - true, observable science is fully compatable with Biblical Christianity. \n \n \n \n \nBut creationists accept extrabiblical evidence over Biblical claims. For instance, no creationist says that the whole world was enrolled as it says in Luke 2:1. Where in the Bible would they get the idea that not everyone was enrolled? No, they used extrabiblical evidence to know that Japanese, Inuits, and Zulus were not enrolled. But all of that contradicts Luke 2:1. \n\n \n The Japanese, Inuits, and Zulus may not have existed at that time. I suppose atheists claim they have scientific proof that they existed billions of years before Luke 2:1 was written, and you would believe them of course. \n \n \nGive me the \"warnings\" and we'll see if they are as plain as you say. :) \n\n \n \nColossians 2:8;\n See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human traditon, and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. \n\n \n You don't think there's any chance that that applies, when you and atheists are in lockstep concerning the origin of rights, the threat of terrorism, the importance of the Ten Commandments? \n \n \n \n \nI left it out because it wasn't relevant. So walk me thru the \"huge difference\" \n\n \n The huge difference is between systems and processes we can observe now, and speculations and assumptions about what happened before recorded history. \n \n \n \n \nYes and no. Both are statements about the physical universe. That is what a theory/hypothesis is. Now, theories/hypotheses come in 3 subgroups:\n 1. Untested.\n 2. Supported.\n 3. Falsified.\n \n Sonic imaging, amniocentesis, and abiogenesis are strongly supported theories. Not just \"supported\", but strongly supported. The first 2 are so strongly supported that they are regarded as (provisionally) fact. I think abiogenesis is in that same category, but many disagree with me. The new hypotheses on religion being a product only of the brain are mostly untested.\n\n \n You think so - atheists think so - many creationists disagree with you. The pattern continues. \n \n \n \n \nSome militant atheists are trying to make the religious brain quirks sound more supported than it is. Since we don't have Miller's comments on those theories, you can't honestly say \"Miller doesn't seem to mind\". That's false witness. Miller, and I, do not object to strongly supported theories like evolution, quantum mechanics, natural selection, etc. There's no point. God has spoken and it's hopeless to argue with Him. \n\n \n Richard Dawkins didn't find it too hopeless - he believes in evolution, quantum mechanics, natural selection, etc. and wrote a best selling book called \"The Blind Watchmaker\" (No God) He did a pretty good job of arguing with him, didn't he?\n \n \n \nThose are Christian proclamations. And yes, I have backed them up. You simply have ignored what I've said. \n\n \n It's not common for Christians to make the Bible secondary to science. \n \n \n \n \nSo name some. Name the Biblical verses. I can name a few of my own: Elaine Pagels, Rev. Gregory Neal. Also, go look at Job. Satan isn't God's adversary there. He's God's betting buddy. He is an \"adversary\", but in Hebrew that means he's the prosecuting attorney for humans. He's working on God's side and on God's behalf. \n\n \n God's \"betting buddy\". What a theologian you are. \n \n \n \nYou just confused two terms: creation and creationism. Theistic evolution is on the side of creation. \n\n \n Yes, a natural creation where he can easily be taken or left. \n \n \n Where did you get the idea that theistic evolution was supposed to be \"halfway\" between creationism and atheism? That's absurd. \n\n \n Any specific position that would show at least some comparable disagreement with atheism, as it has with \"creationism\". Evolution seems much more important to theistic evolutionists than eternal salvation. \n \n \n \n \n\"But you cannot believe in a god of a literal inerrant Bible and accept evolution. However, as a Christian I don't have any problem with that. \n\n \n Neither do atheists. \n \n \nAfter all, if your god is a literal inerrant Bible you are worshipping a false idol. \"\n\n \n I've never heard of a book, a collection of words, to be an \"idol\". Is Millers' book your idle? The \"Origin of Species\"? \n \n \nRead what I wrote. Marc, seriously, this discussion goes better if your reading comprehension is up to standard. I never said \"the Bible is a false idol\". Instead, I said a literal inerrant Bible . The Bible is not God. \"literal inerrant\" refers to a human way to read the Bible. It's not the way the Bible is meant to be read, as told us by Jesus, Paul, and God. \n\n \n Chapters and verses? Or did they tell us that by screwing up something, like Luke 2:1?\n \n \n \nI was referring to Genesis 1-3. If I take it literally, Genesis 1 contradicts with Genesis 2-3. So, the text itself tells us that a literal interpretation is not correct. Truth cannot contradict truth (that's a basic Christian doctrine). \n\n \n That they contradict is an atheist claim. Assumptions have to be made concerning the meanings of words like \"now\" and \"then\". Atheists make those assumptions. Why do theistic evolutionists make the same assumptions? \n \n \n \n \nFirst, you skipped the point! I said \"Sorry, a literal interpretation of the Bible is not \"God's word\". That you think so shows how much you do not worship God.\" A literal interpreation is just a human idea. \n\n \n But a non literal interpretation is above \"just a human idea\", when science is included, complete with assumptions and speculations of atheists?\n \n \nSecond, theistic evolutionists DON'T do the same things on Sunday mornings that atheists do. They go to church. If you are Rev. McCosh, you LEAD worship services. Atheists never do that. \n\n \n If they go to non theistic evolution churches, I guess they have to do some pretty careful screening, and stay home if the sermon is about the book of Genesis, or any of Jesus' references to the book of Genesis. \n \n \nSecond, why do you think theistic evolution needs its own denomination? There are no applications of theistic evolution in everyday life. Believing God used the processes discovered by science says nothing about whether we are saved by grace alone or whether we need works. It says nothing about whether you should say \"trespasses\" or \"debts\" in the Lord's prayer or what type of church governance you like. \n\n \n Different Protestant denominations have different ideas about how often to take communion, how to baptize, how much beer we should drink through the week, etc. They're all in pretty basic agreement on the historical content of the Bible, as it relates to the nature of God, how the Bible is taught, how to find and know God, the basis of Jesus work of redemption, etc. It's all completely different for theistic evolution. In theistic evolution, Jesus dies a literal death for a non literal original sin. Don't theistic evolutionists get up and walk out of Protestant churches quite often?\n \n \n \n \nYou didn't quote the whole sentence! \"Fundies believe like atheists: if there are material causes, then God is absent.\"\n \n You never bothered to deny the truth of that. You can't. After all, you think that evolution means God is absent. Yet that is just what atheists think! I can see why you want to try to distract the issue from the similarity of creationism and atheism, but you can't hide or run from it. \n\n \n It's easy to \"run\" from, because it only exists in your mind - atheists have convinced you. The Bible says that all natural processes are guided by God. You should go to someone besides atheists for your information about creationists sometimes. \n \n \n BTW, I don't need to use \"Fundies\" as derogatory term -- Fundamentalists is just as derogatory. \"Fundie\" just happens to be shorter. The atheist equivalent of Fundies are \"militant atheists\". \n\n \n I agree, but \"militant athies\" would be more fun.\n \n \n \n \n \nEvolution and abiogenesis don't have God in them, do they? According to you, that is. You don't allow God to create by \"natural\" processes, do you?\n\n \n Not when those natural processes involve assumptions and speculation, and distort the Bible beyond recognition. \n \n \n \n \nNo, we can't. The universe is what it IS, not what Miller and I want it to be. We find out what the universe really is. Which means we are finding out how God really created, not trying to tell God how He created, like creationists do. And if Miller and I are wrong, God (the physical universe) will tell us. Who tells you that your literal interpretation of the Bible is wrong? Well, God in the text and God in creation, but you don't listen to God. \n\n \n That may be our main difference, your god is the physical universe of Richard Dawkins, mine is the Judeo Christian God of the Bible. Yet both of our Gods claim the same son of the New Testament. emoticon_confused \n \n \n \n \nJohn Calvin. Major Christian theologian, contemporary of Martin Luther, one of the founders of Protestantism in general and the Reformed Tradition in particular. Are you that ignorant of Christian theology and history that you don't recognize the name Calvin? Guess so. Even more evidence that you are not a Christian. \n\n \n Well that's the beauty of Christianity. Christians aren't ranked according to how much they know about human history. I've never claimed to be an expert on Christian history. It's not required for salvation. If you think it is, that's even more evidence that you are not a Christian. \n \n \n \n \n1. Yes, because whatever our personal beliefs, we still have to test our ideas against God's Creation. God doesn't care about our personal beliefs. He is Truth. \n\n \n If you think God is the physical universe, you're right. But if you're a Christian that knows who God actually is, as told by Matthew, Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc. you know that he cares deeply about our personal beliefs.\n \n \n2. The \"basic\" way of reading the Bible is NOT your way. You don't even use the \"basic way\" most of the time. \n\n \n I use the way described by Jesus, the Prophets and the Apostles. \n \n \n3. How does it make sin meaningless. Actually, evolution explains sin and why we all sin. Sin is an inevitable by-product of how God created us. Genesis 2-3 explained sin in theological terms. Evolution gives the biological basis and why all humans sin. \n\n \n Was that in the Blind Watchmaker book? emoticon_confused \n \n \nI have to go now. I'll do the rest some other time. This is probably enough to set you frothing at the mouth as it is. Don't want to give you a coronary.\n\n \n Oh no, not at all, you seem to represent theistic evolution very well - your substance / personal insult ratio is very acceptable. Out of time tonight myself, but I want to get into your next post about Millers book soon. I'll probably forget about you if someone takes me up on the formal debate though. I think it will happen eventually, and it will be good. A 50% chance I'll win, and a 100% chance I'll make my points.",

   "Wow...\n \n The ignorance, hate, and just out and out lying on display by Marc tonight is truly on another level. Usually you're good at embarassing yourself Marc, but tonight was special, even for you.\n \n \nBut they're going to be able to put their own senses in proper perspective, if they know what Proverbs 3: 5,6 says.\n\n \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart,\n \n And lean not on your own understanding;\n \n In all your ways acknowledge Him,\n \n And He shall direct your paths.\"\n \n Yep, Marc is a Troo Christian all right. Ignorant, and proud of it. Please explain to me how this passage means \"Don't trust your own eyes. The world lies to you\" Marc.\n \n \nPractically no one is a 100% Biblical literalist. If there was, we'd be seeing some people walking around with no eyes, or hands.\n\n Exactly how would my hand or eye offend me? Besides which, it's pretty cleat that passage is not meant to be taken literally (Gasp! Blasphemy!)\n \n \nSo having \"In God We Trust\" is forcing religion, having \"There is no god to trust\" is forcing atheism, and the solution is to simply say nothing about God?\n\n Oh! He got it! Guys, he got it!\n \n \nMaybe it works with money, but it doesn't work for many other things, including politics and science. Often, the complete presence of God, or the complete absence of God are the only two considerations.\n\n Never mind, false alarm. Go back about your business. Marc, check out Matthew 6:6. \n \n \nThere are only two reasons it is more organized today. 1) Government is much bigger and more corrupt (affected by special interests)\n\n You keep prattling on about this, yet the current US administration is one of the most overtly \"Christian\" ever elected, and you even go on to state in your post that you believe the democrats to be promoting atheism, thus implying that the republicans are the christian party. You can't have it both ways Marc.\n \n \nLooks like someone thought atheism was a valid intellectual position 200+ years ago. Times often don't change as much as we think they do.\n\n Yeah, 200 years ago someone else was whining about not living in a theocracy. What's your point?\n \n \nHave you ever heard of George Soros? He's personally given $5 billion to promote atheism around the world, much of it in U.S. politics.\n\n And how much has the \"Moral Majority\" sunk into U.S politics in a bid to get a like minded candidate elected?\n \n \nHow about Progressive Insurance? They didn't just pull the name \"progressive\" out of thin air - they gave $8.5 million to the ACLU\n\n And your religion is regressive. We know. Exactly what has the ACLU done, other than make sure that you enjoy the rights guaranteed in the constitution? Wah, you can't force your religion on school kids. Good. How'd you like your son/daughter to say a prayer to Allah or Vishnu before the first class of the morning? You probably wouldn't, just like Hindis and Muslims don't like their kids saying prayers to your god before class starts. Everyone has the right to practice their religion.\n \n \nYou see much more neutrality in secular society than I do. It seems that you don't have much interest in politics.\n\n Or he doesn't see a conspiracy behing everything like you do.\n \n \nThere is no hard, defining line that determines when it definitely is / definitely is not being taught. It is implied\n\n How? Details already Marc. A year of you hinting at a vast conspiracy to brainwash kids, then running away when pressed for details is getting damn old already.\n \n \nThe formal debate proposition is waiting for you.\n\n I think you've already ran from a challenge or two. Maybe you should buck up and meet those first, eh?\n \n \nWhen \"agnostics\" like Stephen Jay Gould (or several posters on these forums) blast religion in exactly the same way that atheists do, it makes it even harder to tell the difference.\n\n I, as an agnostic, don't blast religion Marc. I blast your interpretation of what it means to be a christian. Big difference.\n \n \nAnyone? Anyone can recreate and observe complex lab experiments - look through the Hubble telescope with their own eyes, or travel to Ellesmere Island, Canada and see the Tiktaalik Roseae?\n\n Pretty much. The fact that you refuse to educate yourself enough to interpret the data is not the fault of science.\n \n \nDuring the 40 years that the Piltdown Man remains were widely believed to be genuine, and were kept locked in a vault, could \"anyone\" see them?\n\n Ah, Piltdown. It's like Old Faithful...\n \n \n\n But of course if you believe it's wrong because the earth does actually move, then you can throw out the assertion that it's immovable by man, and allow Al Gore to convince you that he can control its temperature, if he's given enough political power. See how Biblical non-literalism can quickly change political views?\n\n Wow....\n \n \nThank you - another example. Atheists agree with you / most creationists do not.\n\n And we're back to the classics-\"If you don't agree with me, you're an evil atheist co-conspirator!\"\n \n \nYou are absolutely right about that. I used the wrong word. I sometimes tend to confuse the two terms \"Muslim\" and \"terrorist\".\n\n You really are a disgusting, ignorant bastard, aren't you Marc? The sad part is you're proud of your hateful, ignorant nature.\n \n \nI'll be watching for a new thread soon, which has you and the atheists here insulting each other about this subject. \n\n The existence or non-existence of God has absolutely no bearing on science. No matter how many times this is explained to you, you never will understand, will you?\n \n \nWho told you that creationists reject all evolution,\n\n Ok Marc, tell us: Which parts of the ToE, specifically, do you not reject?\n \n \ntrue, observable science is fully compatable with Biblical Christianity\n\n You're right, as was understood by Augustine and others. And, unlike you, they didn't determine what was \"true, observable science\" for themselves, and discard the rest as false, even if they didn't like it.\n \n \nThe Japanese, Inuits, and Zulus may not have existed at [the time of Augustus Caesar]\n\n ...Wow...again\n \n \nI suppose atheists claim they have scientific proof that they existed billions of years before Luke 2:1 was written, and you would believe them of course.\n\n Yes Marc, everyone knows this but you. Before the heavens and the earth, there was the Zulus\n \n \nYou don't think there's any chance that that applies, when you and atheists are in lockstep concerning the origin of rights, the threat of terrorism, the importance of the Ten Commandments?\n\n Here's another good example of Marc's mode of thinking-if you agree on one thing, you must agree on all things, or you don't agree on anything.\n \n \nIt's not common for Christians to make the Bible secondary to science.\n\n It is common for Christians to make the Bible complementary to reality though\n \n \nBut a non literal interpretation is above \"just a human idea\", when science is included, complete with assumptions and speculations of atheists?\n\n I've been trying not to butt in and answer questions regarding Lucaspa's posts, but Marc, give your head a shake. You just asked if a non literal interpretation of the bible which agrees with reality is better than a literal interpretation that disagrees with reality (yes, I know you threw some more EAC nonsense in there. I ignored it.)\n \n \nIf they go to non theistic evolution churches, I guess they have to do some pretty careful screening, and stay home if the sermon is about the book of Genesis, or any of Jesus' references to the book of Genesis.\n\n Someday Marc's going to realize the vast majority of Christians think he's looney. Take a picture of the look on your face when that happens Marc. I want to see.\n \n \nI've never claimed to be an expert on Christian history. It's not required for salvation. If you think it is, that's even more evidence that you are not a Christian.\n\n Marc, ever hear of reading for context? It's even more important when you're discussing a book written between 3500 and 1800 years ago by a foreign culture. That would be where knowing Christian history comes in handy. Not to mention that if you study some christian history, you can find out what people who studied the bible (and built upon centuries of study of the bible), think the bible is actually saying, rather than reading a translated, bastardized version for yourself, and declaring \"I know what it means!\"\n \n Oh, and I notice you finally grew a pair and admitted flat out that you don't think theistic evolutionists are actually Christians. 'Bout time.\n \n \nyour substance / personal insult ratio is very acceptable\n\n You didn't do too bad yourself. You disparaged an entire race, dismissed the deeply held beliefs of the majority of Christians (and all non-christians), insinuated that all who don't believe as you are part of a global conspiracy to ruin the world and condemn everyone to hell, and throughout it all, ducked and skirted the main issues raised by Lucaspa. Yep, it was definitely a Marc post. Well done!",

   "Practically no one is a 100% Biblical literalist. If there was, we'd be seeing some people walking around with no eyes, or hands. (Matthew 5: 29,30) There are always different degrees to Biblical literalism, and that literalism applies to two different things - the historical aspect, and the behavior aspect.\n\n Practically no one is a Biblical inerrantist because inerrancy is -- for all intents and purposes -- impossible to defend. What we get instead is people like marc and EZ who pick and choose what they'll take literally, what they'll de-emphasize as metaphor/allegory, and what they'll completely ignore.\n \n \nLooks like someone thought atheism was a valid intellectual position 200+ years ago. Times often don't change as much as we think they do.\n\n Says the person believing in 2000+ year old myths.\n \n \nBut I don't see an \"organized\" atheism. I don't see a political party advocating atheism.\n\n I do - the Democrat [party].\n\n You're off your rocker. Show me where in the Democratic party's platform atheism is advocated. And don't pull the \"everything different that my beliefs is atheism\" insanity again.\n \n \nHave you ever heard of George Soros? He's personally given $5 billion to promote atheism around the world, much of it in U.S. politics. How about Progressive Insurance? They didn't just pull the name \"progressive\" out of thin air - they gave $8.5 million to the ACLU.\n\n pisspoor examples, I'd say, and still dwarfed by religionist counterparts.\n \n \nThe formal debate proposition is waiting for you.\n\n No it's not; your pathetic excuse for a resolution is waiting, and nobody's biting.\n \n \nAgain, I don't see a big change in the feasability of atheism from 200 years ago to today. There have been recent new scientific discoveries (the complexity of life for example) that can make atheism harder to believe today than it was in previous generations.\n\n You really like this example, yet the collection of \"new scientific discoveries\" includes the ones that show exactly how feasible evolution is, and exactly how such \"complexity\" doesn't require supernatural guidance. You're just too willfully ignorant to look into it.\n \n \nWhen \"agnostics\" like Stephen Jay Gould (or several posters on these forums) blast religion in exactly the same way that atheists do, it makes it even harder to tell the difference. It's a thing called logic.\n\n You know nothing of logic.\n \n \nAnyone? Anyone can recreate and observe complex lab experiments - \n\n Not people who refuse to educate themselves enough to actually recreate them, but even an idiot can observe.\n \n \nlook through the Hubble telescope with their own eyes\n\n You don't know much about the HST, do you?\n \n \nor travel to Ellesmere Island, Canada and see the Tiktaalik Roseae?\n\n It's not there anymore, Holmes, but you're welcome to go and look for another specimen.\n \n \nWhen it comes to blasting creationists, there are more similarities than differences among atheists and theistic evolutionists.\n\n When it comes to disagreeing with Islam, there are more similarities than differences among atheists and Christians. Therefore Christianity must be atheistic. Pretty simple conclusion when using marckian logic.\n \n \nThe Japanese, Inuits, and Zulus may not have existed at that time.\n\n So the Japanese didn't exist 2000 or so years ago? Or was \"Luke\" writing about something he (i.e. she) didn't see? Either way, your position is crippled.\n \n \nRichard Dawkins didn't find it too hopeless...\n\n You're saying that Dawkins, an atheist, didn't find the idea of arguing against a God in which he does not believe \"hopeless\"? I'd think so! That's like wondering why you're not afraid of Vishnu.\n marckian logic = comedy gold.",

   "The chapter is entitled \"Beyond Materialism\". You have not read the book, because you are ignoring the context and the argument. Let's go back to page 191, the end of the last chapter. Miller is talking about Lewontin's famous Lewontin quote \"To appeal to an omnipotent deity is to allow that at any moment the regularities of nature may be ruptured, that miracles may happen.\" As I said, Lewontin was being sarcastic in that quote and criticizing Sagan's philosophical materialism. But Miller decides to take it seriously. \n\n \n He sure did, he said \"exactly true\" right after it. I don't see where you're getting sarcasm from Lewontin's quote, and where you see a criticism of Sagan, since nothing about Sagan was being addressed there. Miller took it so seriously that he said it was exactly true, but if he were an actual Christian he may have said \"exactly false\". Christians know that miracles that happen \"at any moment\" aren't to be dealt with untill they actaully happen. Untill then, Christians figure that God's plan of allowing free will is taking place in this day and age. The \"appeal to an omnipotent deity\" concerns miricles of the past - regularities of nature being ruptured in the past, before science was there to observe it. \n \n \n\"But Lewontin has misssed something, something important. What if the regularities of nature were fashioned in a way that they themselves allowed for the divine? What if the logical connections he makes between materialism and atheism are flawed? What if the very foundations that sem to lock evolution and religion into conflict were built upon suspect ground? In other words, what if the gods of disbelief were false?\" \n\n \n And what if Miller quit siding politically with atheists who constantly use the courts to block different types of scientific exploration that could very well shed some light on these \"what ifs\", scientific exploration like ID?\n \n \nThe next 2 chapters is where Miller answers those questions on the side of theism.\n \n Now, after the Sagan quote on page 94, you need to read the context of the rest of the chapter. Miller goes on to describe classical physics and the implications of that \n \n \"Science has shown that material mechanisms, not spirits, were behind the reality of nature. ... Could there be anything left for God to do?\"\n \n Miller spends the rest of the chapter showing \"yes, there is\". He describes classical physics and the implications for deism. He then describes quantum mechanics and spends a lot of time showing its implications for theism.\n \n pg 201 \"there is a pattern to these uncertainties [at the quantum level], and those patterns account for the fact that the universe seems pretty orderly to us. Although we cannot predict the outcomes of individual events with any certainty, the overall outcomes of thousands of such events fall into very predictable patterns.\"\n \n But what you really want is on page 213:\n \"Committed atheists like Richard Dawkins would attack with ridicule any suggestion that room for the work of a Deity can be found in the physical nature of reality. But Dawkins' personal skepticism no more disproves the existence of God than the creationists' incredulity is an argument against evolution. What matters is the straightforward, factuazl, strictly scientific recognition that matter in the universe behaves in such a way that we can never achieve complete knowledge of any fragment of it, and life itself is structured in a way that allows biological history to pivot directly on these tiny uncertainties. That ought to allow even the most critical scientist to admit that the breaks in causality at the atomic level make it fundamentally impossible to exclude the idea that what we have really caught a glimpse of might indeed reflect the mind of God.\" \n\n \n Then Miller and Dawkins have a huge difference in philosophy. Why do we see far more winking and nodding going on between them than we do disagreement, as in Miller vs. Dembski, or Miller vs. Morris? Because the science is the same? (I know you're saying YES!!!!!!!) But is the philosophy the same? The politics? \n \n \n \nMiller , on pp 214-215, is talking about you, Marc: \n \"Ironically, anti-evolutionists, just like the extreme materialists, seem to work in an intellectual world uninformed by modern physics. To their way of thinking, scientific materialism necessarily implies a complete, causal, mechanistic description of natural reality. They have seen the profound success of biology in providing material explanations for the nature of life, and they are worried. ...\n\n \n Yes - worried how atheists use the \"profound success of biology\" as a weapon against the political foundation of the U.S. while masking and ignoring the profound failure of biology to explain the origin of life. \n \n \n \n\"see each new materialist, scientific explanation for a natural phenomenon as a retreat for the primacy of God. ... In this respect, they are the unlikely and unwitting allies of vigorous atheists like Dawkins, Provine, and Lewontin who would agree enthusiastically that a complete success for materialistic science condemns any search for God to ultimate failure.\"\n \n Miller doesn't agree with you and Dawkins, Marc. \n\n \n \"He doesn't agree\" with us equally either. Dawkins and I take firm positions, his fuzzy middle ground likes Dawkins a lot better than it likes those who represent creationism. \n \n \nYou can see why and how in the section \"A Science of Belief\". Read it, Marc. \n\n \n No such section, or chapter in the book. Are you talking about chapter 6, \"The gods of disbelief\"? What it says is fairly typical of the entire book, he quotes statements by Dawkins, Provine, etc. that declare science proves there is no God, then says \"statements like these can provoke powerful reactions\" (page 172) from the likes of Dembski and Morris. He then goes into detailed attacks on Dembski and Morris, and forgets all about Dawkins and Provine!!\n \n In the chapter \"The gods of disbelief\", please start with the quote above quote and go through most of page 173. I won't quote it all, but to summarize, Miller informally noticed Morris at breakfast the morning after the two of them had a public debate the night before, and Miller wanted to gloat about the \"victory\" he achieved in front of a scientific audience, an audience with a desire for Miller to win of course. He actually quoted much of what Morris said at this little breakfast, including \"you don't realize what's at stake.....scientific data aren't the ultimate authority.  Millers feeling were undoubtedly injured, because he then had this to say to the readers of his book;\n \n \n...Nontheless, however one might admire Morris's strength of character, convictions that allow science to be bent beyond recognition are not merely unjustified - they are dangerous in the intellectual and even in the moral sense, because they corrupt and compromise the integrity of human reason.\n \n My impromptu breakfast with Henry Morris taught me an important lesson - the appeal of creationism is emotional, not scientific. I might be able to lay out graphs and charts and diagrams, to cite laboratory experiments and field observations, to describe the details of one evolutionary sequence after another, but to the true believers of creationism, these would all be sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth would always be somewhere else. \n\n \n Now let's change a few words around and see what we get;\n \n Nontheless, however one might admire Miller's strength of character, convictions that allow the BIBLE to be bent beyond recongnition are not merely unjustified, they are dangerous in the intellectual and even in the moral sense, because they compromise the integrity of human reason.\n \n This impromptu breakfast with Miller teaches us all an important lesson - the appeal of naturalistic evolution is emotional, not scientific. I might be able to lay out charts and graphs and diagrams, citing a reasonable combination of science, history, math, and other subjects, but to true believers of Godless evolution, these would all be sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth would always be somewhere else. \n \n If you don't think the promotion of evolution is emotional, please read post #130 of this thread. \n \n \n \nAnd then read chapter 8 \"The Road Back Home\". Try the first paragraph on page 243. \n\n \n Here it is;\n \n \n By any reasonable analysis, evolution does nothing to distance or to weaken the power of God. We already know that we live in a world of natural causes, explicable by the workings of natural law. All that evolution does is to extend the workings of these natural laws to the novelty of life and to it's changes over time. A God who presides over an evolutionary process is not an impotent, passive observer. Rather, He is one whose genius fashioned a fruitful world in which the process of continuing creation is woven into the fabric of matter itself. He retains the freedom to act, to reveal Himself to His creatures, to inspire, and to teach. He is the master of chance and time, whose actions, both powerful and subtle, respect the independence of His creation and give human beings the genuine freedom to accept or to reject His love. \n\n \n \"To inspire, and to teach\". Again, Collossians 2:8;\n \n \nSee to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. \n\n \n Dawkins, Provine, and many others use evolution as a weapon, to sway human beings to reject Gods love. Philosophical evolution is a principle of this world. It doesn't \"distance or weaken the power of God\", but Christians consider atheists use of it to be hollow and deceptive. Why don't theistic evolutionists? \n \n \nYou seem concerned that Sagan did not mention ES cell research, abortion, and other unnamed things. First, while mouse ES cells were isolated in 1970, it was not until 1998 that human ES cells were isolated and cultured. So there was no ES cell \"debate\" when Sagan wrote Demon Haunted Woodland. Nor is there any uncertainty in how to isolate and culture ES cells.\n \n The abortion issue is not a scientific one. Yes, abortions are doable and safe. Pregnancies can be safely (for the mother) terminated at any stage. But I see no reason for Sagan to mention that. Sagan was talking about treatments and diagnostic techniques. There are thousands of them, all as reliable as amniocentesis and the ones Sagan mentioned. He couldn't list them all.\n \n \n \n But you DO twist the Bible to suit yourself. That's what we've seen in all your posts. You admit it was written over a 1400 year period, but you never consider what it meant to the people at the time a particular book was written. \n\n \n What was different about those people? They had two arms, two legs etc. just like we do. They loved, hated, made war, had the same 10 commandments to consider as we do, on and on. The only difference between them and us is that we have more gadgets - a higher standard of living. We've ~evolved~ , and it all involved purpose and intelligent design, didn't it?\n \n \nAll you are concerned about is what you want the Bible to mean, not what it actually means. \n\n \n If I take it \"literally\" I'm twisting it, and since you don't take it literally, allowing for a practically endless interpretation controversy, you know exactly what it means? I take it you toss out Collossians 2:8 along with most of Genesis, yet still insist that what you want the Bible to mean is not an issue? \n \n \nSince you don't think God talks to you, yes, you do set the Bible up as your false idol and worship it. You can't stand any possibility that it's not 100% accurate.\n \n \n \n You were labeling some primary causes as secondary causes, i.e, the formation of the universe. You were also saying that God zapping the first cell was a secondary cause. The term \"secondary cause\" refers to the material causes. \n \n Atheists don't believe material causes are \"secondary causes\" because they don't believe there is a deity to use material causes. For theists, the material causes discovered by science are the secondary causes God used to create. Does that clear up the confusion for you? \n\n \n Not really - I'm still wondering what percentage of \"The Blind Watchmaker\" theistic evolutionists believe. 90%? 95%? \n \n \n \n \nFighting creationists is helping theism. Creationism is the most destructive idea to hit Christianity since the Manichean and Gnostic heresies -- and creationism invokes both of those! \n\n \n Do you believe that creationists are not saved by Christ's redeeming work? \n \n If not, then how can you go to church with them, without starting your own denomination? If so, then how is creationism a \"destructive idea\"? \n \n \nYes, I think the US government does have remnants of an unintentional, but still unfair establishment of theism as a religion. \n\n \n If it's \"unfair\", it should be unestablished??? HOW DOES THAT HELP THEISM??\n \n \n \n \nGod speaks thru His Creation. Christianity has always held that God has \"two books\". \n\n \n Who said that?\n \n \n One is Creation. So what if atheists proclaim evolution shows God does not exist? Does that make them right? NO! They are not right about that. Anymore than creationists are right that God created by creationism.\n\n \n Yet there is such a difference between the way theistic evolutions oppose atheists, and creationists. I wonder if Miller ever had lunch with Dawkins? Didn't say in his book. \n \n \n \nSorry, but the data from scientific studies disproves that. Witham and Larson's survey was half from biological fields and they got 40% of all scientists are theists -- by a very conservative definition. That is not possible if 90% of biologists are atheists.\n \n Also, Gould is adamant that at least 50% of evolutionary biologists are theists. The \"consensus\" is by atheists trying to cook the data. Why do you believe them? \n\n \n The numbers conflict badly concerning the beliefs of scientists. Data is cooked by both sides I would guess. I'd also guess that a lot of data is cooked concerning evolution. The problem is, atheists use their data to politically oppose creationists, while theistic evolutionists use different data to politically oppose creationists. It's done in other ways as well - your insistance that atheism is a faith works well for your arguement that politically opposes creationism, but it doesn't go over well with most atheists. When it's a political issue concerning the first amendment to oppose creationists, they insist that theirs is not a faith, so the first amendment doesn't apply to what they want to do. Theistic evolutionists seem to always be very silent on those issues. \n \n \n \n \nNearly all of The Blind Watchmaker discusses the reality and mechanism of evolution. Dawkins references to religion amount to about 5 sentences in the book. Evolution is a fascinating topic, which is why the book sold so well. \n And no, the popularity of the book has nothing to do with Johnson being right or wrong. Johnson wasn't denying that Dawkins was correct about the effect of evolution on atheism. Dawkins is correct on that. Evolution by natural selection made atheism, for the first time, a rational faith. But it by no means makes it obligatory to be an atheist. That is also correct. \n\n \n So in an entire book that promotes atheism, there are 5 sentences of difference between atheism and theistic evolution? Evolution is fascinating because of its social and political implications, not its biological details. If not, our universities would be far more overloaded with biology students than they are. \n \n \n \n \nGould wasn't discussing politics. Here, let me give you the sentence you apparently can't read for yourself:\n \n \"Either half my colleagues are enormously stupid, or else the science of Darwinism is fully compatible with conventional religious beliefs\" The data show that evolution is not atheistic but is compatible with theism. \n\n \n Often, the best way to do tricky things in politics is not to discuss politics. That one is often tossed out by atheists, as well as theistic evolutionists. \"Darwinism is fully compatible with conventional religious beliefs\". As long as we keep \"conventional religious beliefs\" in their proper place, right? Keep them in our own personal world and OUT of politics?\n \n \n \n \nWhy aren't you chuckling? Don't you find it amusing that such a militant atheist who claims evolution absolutely excludes God can write of a method where God can influence evolution and not be detected? \n\n \n It's not amusing to me because if he's not detected, he's not considered. \n \n \nOh, that's right. It destroys your vision of Dawkins as the devil and totally against religion. \n\n \n Not hardly. Dawkins is okay with religion as long as it can exist out of the realm of truth, so he can continue to make fun of it. \n \n \n \n \nIt's page 252, in the middle of the page. I just re-checked. I think you made a mistake in looking at page numbers. Before you try to get too self-righteous, you might remember the parable on dust motes, logs, and eyes.\n \n I never claimed Miller made a \"detailed description of \"primary\" and \"secondary\" causes\". You are making a strawman. I simply claimed that Miller discussed what are, in other terms, secondary causes. \n\n \n Well okay, I did find those 5 words on page 252. I guess I missed them the first time because I was looking for something to distinguish between primary and secondary causes. You said the phrase \"God would use material processes\" was a \"clear indication\" of secondary causes. I don't think it's all that clear. Why did he use other terms? \n \n \n \n \n1. Miller didn't say that what you said. Miller said \"\"The irony is that only those who embrace the scientific reality of evolution are adequately prepared to give God the credit and the power that He truly deserves.\" Now, Bible scholars can embrace evolution. And those who deny evolution can still give God \"credit and power\", but not what \"He truly deserves\". IOW, creationists fall short of giving God the appropriate credit.\n \n 2. You and Biblical literalists are not \"Bible scholars\". \n\n \n I don't claim to be a Bible scholar, but it seems to me that someone who doesn't take the Bible literally wouldn't be a very good judge about who is, and who is not, a Bible scholar. \n \n \n \n1. I made a typo mistake on the page number.\n\n \n So I don't have a complete monopoly on dust motes, logs and planks and all that? :) \n \n \n \n \n2. Because Dawkins and Miller have different evidence. Part of that is evidence within science. As Miller shows, Dawkins is not considering the effect of quantum mechanics. He is basing his argument on science and God on the deterministic view of the 19th century. But the major part of the difference in evidence is evidence from outside science. The real evidence for theism does not come from science. It's rooted in personal experience that lies outside science. Miller (and I) trust the personal experience of the people in the Bible. Not a literal reading, but the general and essential claims: God spoke to Moses and engineered the Exodus, God communicated with David, Solomon, and helped Israel, Jesus lived, died, and was Resurrected, Paul had a genuine experience on the road to Damascus, etc. Miller may also have personal experience of God; he doesn't say so outright because it is not appropriate to this book. \n \n Dawkins doesn't have personal experience of God and Dawkins doesn't accept the accounts of other people, including those in the Bible.\n \n I don't think I'm wrong about your not reading the book. I think you skimmed the book to find passages that supported your preconceived viewpoint. You supported my theory when you said \"And this one from the same page, if you wouldn't have quoted it, I sure would have\". If you'd known about the quote, you would have used it. I don't think you found it until I made you read the page searching for the quote I posted.\n\n \n \n No, I was just waiting for an opportune time to use it - I had it underlined from when I read the book. You seem to be assuming that because I don't have a sharp new knowledge of science that I haven't read it. I did discover that it's a science book, but I'm not all that interested in detailed science. I read it to see what it said about \" a scientists search for common ground between God and evolution\" as it says in bold letters on the cover. I didn't see any detailed searches for God, except a claim that God is a personal matter, not to be considered by science and subsequently, politics. \n \n \nLucaspa: \"How? How can the human do anything about God?\"\n \n [marc9000]By convincing millions of readers that he doesn't exist - that a \"Blind Watchmaker\" is responsible for our existance.\" \n \n ROFL! And that is going to make a difference \"about\" God? You really think God is going to disappear if a few millions of readers decide not to believe in Him? Do you think He will stop loving people as much? All I can say is that your god is very trivial. I'm so very glad that God is not like that at all.\n\n \n It is going to make a difference TO God. He is very grieved that atheists and theistic evolutionists are causing people to turn away from him. If you think he's not, you don't know him too well. \n \n \n \n \nHow do you know? But even so, that isn't saying Augustine is wrong, is it? So, your comment is irrelevant. Besides, you haven't read Augustine, have you? This is just an excuse not to look up something that shows your arguments to be wrong. :) \n\n \n So you don't know the difference between Inspired Holy Scripture and other writings? Why am I not surprised? \n \n \n \nPlease, read all my response before you start to post. As you found out, Dawkins and company are \"taken to task\" \n\n \n Where did I find that out? Not in Millers book, that's for sure. \n \n \n \nWhat specifically of Horowitz do you want me to read? I haven't encountered these \"thousands and thousands\" in my 30 years in university science departments. Or at meetings. The overwhelming majority of scientists keep their personal beliefs to themselves. \n\n \n http://www.townhall.com/columnists/PaulWeyrich/2006/03/09/the_professors_the_101_most_dangerous_academics_in_america\n \n \n \n1. The scientists have no control whether their comments make it to the NY Times frontpage. By this complaint you admit that your idea is falsified. BTW, part of Scott's \"taking to task\" was published in the scientifically prestigious \"New York Academy of Science\" journal\n \n 2. You need to document that evolution is being taught as atheism in public schools. This is a continual complaint by creartionists but, despite my repeated requests, not one can document a case.\n \n And yes, Eugenie Scott's complaint did change how evolution was defined by the BSC for public school science teachers. \n \n \" In late 1995, the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) issued a statement to its members and the public concerning the importance of evolution to biology teaching. Part of the statement defined evolution:\n \n The diversity of life on earth is the result of evolution: an unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable and natural process of temporal descent with genetic modification that is affected by natural selection, chance, historical contingencies and changing environments.\n \n Shortly after this statement appeared, I began to see letters to the editor from around the country decrying the \"atheism\" of the NABT. Anti-evolutionists like Phillip Johnson included broadsides against NABT in their writings. As one Christian said to me, defining evolution as \"unsupervised\" and \"impersonal\" implied to many Americans that \"God had nothing to do with it and life has no meaning.\" Reflecting these public concerns, two distinguished theologians, Cornell's Huston Smith and Notre Dame's Alvin Plantinga, wrote a polite letter to NABT's board of directors, asking it to delete the two words \"unsupervised\" and \"impersonal\".They specifically noted that the use of the two words \"has two unfortunate and unin tended consequences. It gives aid and comfort to extremists in the religious right for whom it provides a legitimate target. And because of its logical vulnerability; it lowers Americans' respect for scientists and their place in our culture.\"\n When the NABT's board convened at its annual meeting in Minneapolis in October 1997, members' initial reaction was that creationists were trying to get them to change the statement, and they weren't about to knuckle under to that sort of pressure. They voted at the end of a 9-hour meeting, after only a brief discussion, not to change the statement.\n Why is this story relevant to my receiving this award? You may be surprised to hear that after I arrived at the NABT meeting, I encouraged the board to do as the theologians asked and drop \"unsupervised\" and \"impersonal\". I'm pleased to say that the board did discuss the issue at greater length and ultimately altered the statement by dropping the two words.\" \n\n \n Do you think this was a good thing? Would it have happened if those crazed creationists like Phillip Johnson hadn't complained? \n \n \n \n \nBoth Miller and Dawkins agree that creationism is a threat to science. So do all scientists, of whatever worldview. Miller's beliefs are certainly not a threat to science. Atheism, per se, is also not a threat to science. However, Dawkins' attempts to get science to \"prove\" his belief is true is a threat to science. \n\n \n We need separation of Dawkins and state then, don't we?\n \n \n \n \nThe \"detail\" you were initially referring to was \"secondary causes\" and science being compatible and supporting theism. That is done in detail in Chapters 7 and 8. \n \n \"The God of the Bible, even the God of Genesis, is a Deity fully consistent with what we know of the scientific reality of the modern world ... What we have learned from science explains, for the first time in human history, how God could have solved the the overpowering logical problems of His divine nature by creating for us a distinctive world of meaning and sustance.\" pg 258\n \n \"To some, the murderous reality of human nature is proof that God is absent or dead. The same reasoning would find God missing from the unpredictable fits and turns of an evolutionary tree. But the truth is deeper. In each case, a Deity determined to establish a world that was truly independent of His whims, a world in which intelligent creatures would face authentic choices between good and evil, would have to fashion a distinct, material reality and then let His creation run. Neither the self-sufficiency or nature nor the reality of evil in the world mean God is absent. To a religious person, both signify something quite different -- the strength of God's love and the reality of our freedom as His creatures.\" pg 269\n \n You seem to be acknowledging that, because you are now introducing a new topic: whether Miller discusses sin. I don't see the relevance. Please walk me thru why you think this is critical. \n\n \n SIN and its forgiveness is as central to Christianity as 'change' is to evolution. \n \n \nMiller doesn't say the word \"sin\" as far as I can see, but he does talk about it indirectly when he talks about \"grace\".\n \n \"There is no scientific way to describe the spiritual concept of grace, which makes it less than real to an absolute materialist. To a believer, grace is as real as the presence of God Himself. Do Darwin's revelations -- the discoveries that locate the sources of human passions in survival mechanisms -- contradict the reality of grace? Not in the least. To a believer, grace is a gift from God that enables us to place our lives in their proper context -- not by denying our biological heritage, but by using it in His service.\" pg 280. \n\n \n And its proper context is to declare it as truth, to be a valuable consideration in all human activity, while relegating God to an insignificant position. A ruling realm vs. a subordinate realm. A fact vs. value distinction to pacify the public, while reducing the value part to an insignificant position in public matters. Leaving worldview clashes to science to adjudicate. And watching our government grow.",
