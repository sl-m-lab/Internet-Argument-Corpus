   "Ok a tiny, and not completely accurate, but dumbed down enough for the populous, history of \"marriage\" in the US.\n \n Marriage has always been thought of as the domain of the \"church\". When the US was founded the \"church\" was the Church of England. \n When the US booted them out of this new country someone had to take over the duties of \"marrying\" couples, keeping birth and death records. Thus the \"county recorder\" position was born. \n The problem I see is that the Government is STILL \"marrying\" people. \n I say if people are that upset about the idea of \"Gay Marriage\" then fine, don't have one. Make all LEGAL unions between couples, regardless of race, age (within legal limits of concent), sex or sexual orientation...be called \"Civil Unions.\" \n \n ALL OF THEM\n \n The problem is that what is going on is a battle between those who disapprove of gay marriages on a RELIGIOUS footing battling against those who want completely equal protections and portability rights under the LAW. \n \n Look, my mom and dad were \"Married\" in a Church, but they have a legally binding document that allows either of them to inherit one anothers estates if one should die, it allows them to move from one state to another and have their legal union recognized equally, it allows my one to visit the other in the hospital..etc. That is a contract which is legally binding in CIVIL COURTS! Thus it's a CIVIL UNION.\n It just happens to be called a MARRIAGE LICENSE. \n \n Again, the problem is when a Justice of the Courts actually \"Marries\" any couple. \n There's no rule stating that a couple has to actually get married once issued a license to do so. All it grants are the legal rights and protections of a legally bound couple. \n \n \n My partner and I have been together for nine years. We have limited protections if something should happen to either of us and there is NO guaruntee that the courts will uphold this \"living wills\", \"limits of Power of Attorney\" ...etc.\n Either one of our families could contest these documents with much more ease than if we were LEGALLY UNIONED in the same manor in which couples of opposite gender are joined. \n \n When an opposite gender couple gets \"married\" whether or not in a church, there is still a LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT upholding almost 1,100 rights, protections and liberties. \n But there is NO such \"ALL IN ONE\" legal document for SAME GENDER couples. \n This is where the laws are lacking and not equally applied.\n \n I don't care what it's called as long as it's equal...equally applied and called the same thing across the board. Pure and simple. \n Keep your RELIGIOUS MARRIAGES. Obviously if your church doesn't want to marry me I certainly don't want my wedding in that church! \n \n :p",

   "This is the exact point I raised in my 11-09-04 posting in the \"Gay Marriage\" thread (with a little more detail). If the individuals wish their union to be called a \"marriage\", fine, let them take it to the religion of their choice and do so. There are religons (Christian ones) now that recognize same gender unions as a \"marriage\". Some don't. That's OK. Practice whatever religion you wish. Have your \"marriage\" recognized thusly. It is called \"freedom of religion\". Get the government out of \"marriage\".\n \n The government's only legitimate concern in this matter should only be civil rights and due process for all individuals; \"civil\" unions, not \"religious\" unions.",

   "Better yet, just call them, along with corporations, \"voluntary associations.\" That's what they are, after all.\n\n \n \n Honestly, I really don't care what they are called as long as they are equal...across the boards, regardless of gender or gender varients. The real point is to make sure these unions between loving, committed couples are protected by law. \n \n I know it pains my own parents to know that their union is protected, yet her daughter's is not. I know she sees my union between my partner and myself as just as ligitimate as hers is with my father.\n I know it just ****** my brother off to know end that he and his wife, and children are protected by law, but his sister and my partner, whom he sees as his sister-in..whatever, should be legally protected without all the legeal hoops. \n There should be an \"all in one\" legal document that protects couples and families no matter what their make up as long as it is in the best interest of long term care, committment and if necessary, childcare, retirement, healthcare...etc. \n All couples; gay, straight, transgendered...whatever. As long as it's distrubuted equally without caveats and clauses. \n My son has been raised, precariously, by two women for the better part of his life. Either by myself and my partner or even before then by myself and my mother. Granted, my mother and I don't share that sort of intimate relationship and I'm not saying that was anykind of \"marriage\" or whatever. Not at all. The fact is that my partner and I are definitely intimate, committed, loving and our priority is the now teenage boy we have been raising together. Later it will be our retirement and longterm care arrangements. But because our \"union\" isn't protected by law nor are any arrangements we have made portable, in the long run it could all be a lot of money waisted on things and papers that could be contested by one family or another. \n \n The thing is that \"marriage licences\" are an \"All in one\" document that \"ASSUMES\" the protections of which my partner and I can and cannot obtain otherwise. Only a tiny portion of protections are we able to obtain through living wills, final wills, long term care documents and power of attorney documents. Neither of us will qualify for spousal Social Security Benefits. My partner can never be included in my Veterans Benefits. My partner might loose any custody or visitation rights if something were to happen to me. I could loose the house we have called home, because it's in her name. I would be forced to actually Purchase it from her estate! If I'm even lucky enough to be offered that chance from her family! \n \n The family my son knows and has grown up with would be ripped apart at it's seams. Sure, he's older now and I don't forsee anything happening to either my partner or I in the next couple of years before he's a legal adult, but one can never tell. Things happen! \n I'm also concerned about all those other families like mine with younger children who would indeed be torn apart. Children who would be shuffled off to people whom they don't know or have never even heard of, all because their non-biological parent wasn't allowed to retain custody because the biological parent's relationship wasn't legally protected! \n That's CRUEL!",
