   "Lawrence O'Donnell calls out Liz Cheney on her criticism of President Obama's visit to Dover to honor returning dead warriors:\n Daily Kos: O'Donnell Destroys Liz Cheney Lies, Hypocrisy On Dover Visit\n \n Check out the three videos.\n\n \n The fact remains that Bush did visit Bethesda and with the families of many fallen soldiers on a regular basis and never, ever did he make it a photo op for personal political gain. This president has never met with the families or injured soldiers without capitalizing on it by making sure the whitehouse press club was present and accounted for in a front and center position to report on it. \n \n But this is small potatoes and not worth making an issue about since Bush is no longer the president. What matters is how Obama is attempting to fundamentally change the character and political nature of our once great republic. That is what will destroy every aspect of the lives and opportunities we enjoyed prior to this marxist taking hold of our country. \n \n Will simone and her ilk still be supporting and praising her messiah when the value of the dollar isn't worth anymore than a mexican peso? I wonder just how much kool-aid these brainwashed socialist sheeple must drink before they will realize they are supporting and defending the very policies which will enslave them into a surfs existence under a third world economy. \n \n Can even one Obama defender show evidence that the policies he is promoting wont destroy everything this country was founded upon and stood for since our birth as a nation? Anyone???",

There was also no W.\n \n While Bush occasionally visited the wounded and the families of those killed, he never went to Dover to salute the fallen. And he barred any media coverage of it, trying to airbrush the evidence that the wars he started were not the cakewalks he had promised. He did not attend a single funeral. It reflected an emotional and spiritual smallness typical of his administration, like Donald Rumsfeld signing letters to families of dead troops with an autopen and Paul Wolfowitz understating the number of war dead.\n\n Maureen Dowd:\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/opinion/01dowd.html",
