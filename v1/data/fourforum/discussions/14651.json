   "  San Diego concedes in suit over open carry \n CalGuns Foundation happily announces that San Diego, in reparation for having arrested a person engaged in legal open carry, has agreed to clear his record and cough up $35,000. The officers didn't know, and San Diego PD had not trained them to know, that in CA open carry of an unloaded firearm is lawful, and thought that the fact he had loaded magazines on him (lawful, too) made it a loaded gun. \n",

   "  Open-carry gun debate surrounds Hometown Fair \n Since their purchase, the Greens, who now legally openly carry unloaded Springfield Armory 9-caliber XD9s, founded the movement South Bay Open Carry to help spread awareness about residents' Second Amendment and constitutional rights to carry.\n \n They began in Hermosa Beach, introducing themselves to the police chief and later the community with a strong presence at Fiesta Hermosa over Labor Day. Everything went smoothly; the Chamber of Commerce invited the group to hold a booth at the fiesta and Police Chief Greg Savelli even showed up that morning to make sure the booth had been secured.\n \n Since their introduction in Hermosa Beach went so well, the couple prepared to openly carry at this weekend's Manhattan Beach Hometown Fair and perhaps even pass out educational flyers in the free speech zone. \n \n In the weeks that followed, the Greens, the Hometown Fair Board and the city would enter a contentious battle over differing interpretations of the law, leading to Green and his legal team threatening lawsuits for civil rights violations and Manhattan Beach Police Chief Rod Uyeda threatening arrests.\n \n Two sides of the story\n \n In late August, as a courtesy to the police department and to help educate those officers who may not understand open carry laws, Green set up a meeting with Uyeda.. \n",

   "  Open Carry Group Plans To Sue Madison \n MADISON, Wis. -- A Wisconsin group said it plans to file a federal lawsuit against the city of Madison for violating their Second Amendment rights.\n \n Wisconsin Carry, an organization that says it supports the right of an individual to carry a gun in public, said the rights of some of its members were violated on Sept. 18 when police issued citations to men for wearing their guns while eating at a Culver's restaurant.\n \n Armed with a Smith & Wesson .38 Special, Nik Clark, president of Wisconsin Carry, is in Madison ready to fight for what he says is right. \n \n \"You can't stop a law abiding person, demand their ID, search and seize their property without probable cause, and that's really what this comes down to,\" said Clark. \n \n I'm telling you, if Open Carry ever gets before the Supreme Court, it will be found as constitutionally protected!",

   "  Why Don't 'Open Carry' Gun-Rights Advocates Target L.A.'s High-Crime Neighborhoods Instead Of ... Manhattan Beach? \n Ah yes, the gun nuts who are part of the Open Carry movement love to show off sidearms and flaunt their rights at Starbucks, Peet's Coffee & Tea, California Pizza Kitchen and now, as the Daily Breeze reports, even at a family fair. \n \n Fair enough (or not). The idea, they say, is to exercise their right to bear arms, especially in a state that seems to make it a crime to even think about guns. \n \n But if they really wanted to make a point instead of scaring people with their lethal phallic symbols, shouldn't the Open Carry folks target areas that could truly benefit from the presence of scary white men with weapons? Why are they instead hanging out with kids at a suburban park this weekend in Manhattan Beach? \n\n YEAH! Make those Gun Nuts carry their unloaded guns in da hood! Let's see what they get, when REAL trouble happens, and they have to stop everything, and try to load the gun! Why don't they do that? Yeah! \n \n Because we are not the police! According the the Anti-gun nuts, this in not our job, and we have no business actually looking for trouble. If they did that, anti-gun nuts would claim all sorts of evil things! \n \n Understand that we have a right to self defense. That is what this is all about. If you do not wish to participate in that Right, we have ZERO Problem with that! That is your right! We just hope that if the Stuff hits the fan, you have a Concealed Carry license holder as part of your party, so they have the legal Right to try to help you.",
