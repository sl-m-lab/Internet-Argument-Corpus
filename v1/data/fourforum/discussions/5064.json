   "When wages lag behind inflation, then inflation isn't being caused by increased consumer spending. This kind of inflation is caused by price hiking which only happens when there is not enough competition in the market. It isn't good for the economy nor did I ever say it was.\n\n \n This kind of inflation? \n \n \n\n You just contradicted what you said above. If real wages haven't changed then nominal wages aren't lagging inflation. Where did you go to school?\n\n \n What? How? That didn't make any sense. Did you just say that to throw me off? Nominal wages are useless as they only show a change in price level, not a change in actual wealth. If real wages do not increase with inflation, then the actual buying power of consumers doesn't increase, it decreases which results in less consumer spending and AD decreases. If AD decreases, SAS will shift upward, resulting in less output. Again, how is that good for the economy? \n \n \n\n Wait a sec! If inflation increases by 100% then your real wage would be $12,500 not $18,000. I think you mean $18,000 would be my \"net income\".\n\n \n No. Huh? Alright. Good, this actually gives me a lower number to work with. Your real wage is $12,500. Inflation of 100% cuts your real wage down to $6,250 resulting in less consumer spending on your part causing less demand, which causes producers to cutback on production, leading to unemployment. Again, how is this good? \n \n \n\n $7K in taxes from $25k in gross income would be about 28% in income taxes. Whooo, that's not good for the economy at all. Pretty high tax bracket for such low income. Anyway, go head...\n\n \n $12,500 is better then $6,250 wouldn't you say? \n \n \n\n Of course not. Did I ever say it did? No.\n\n \n But utlimtely that is what will occur if you double the money supply. \n \n \n\n If real wages aren't keeping up with inflation, as you first suggested, then the US dollar IS tanking.\n\n \n Not necessarily. The dollar isn't entirely tied to the real wage. Your senario would work in a closed economy, but that isn't the situation here. The US dollar is to a degree, being kept artifically high because countries such as Japan keep large reserves of it and a signifiecnt portion of oil transactions are done in dollars, causing a demand for dollars and raises their value. \n \n \n\n Now you aren't even trying to be serious.\n\n \n Would you keep a reserve of money that was quickly losing value? It's already starting to happen. A number of countries have swapped a large portion of their dollar reserves for Euros. That's one factor in the dollar's recent slide. \n \n \n\n Hey, you've gotten lost in your own hypothetical here. Symbiote was talking about inflation caused by increasing the money supply. You are talking about inflation persisting with low wages which has historically been caused by retracting the money supply. What's your point?\n\n \n What? If you double the money supply inflation is going to hit unless you can double the amount of goods for sale at the same time. Obviously that can't happen. Therefore inflation is going to hit 100% reducing real wages by 50% as everything costs double what it used to. That causes the amount of consumer spending to tank resulting in a shift of the AD curve to the left and the shift of the SAS curve up. That results in a recession. How is that good for the economy? \n \n \n\n Now I think you're just trolling.\n\n \n Explain why demand, or more appropaitely, consumer consumption would increase if real wages decreased. \n \n \n\n All this doom and gloom simply from abolishing taxes, huh? Real funny, go troll someone elses thread.\n\n \n That's not from abolishing taxes, it's from doubling the money supply. \n How can there be more consumer consumption when the amount of buying power out there has decreased by 50%? Wouldn't real GDP decrease because of that? \n \n As I recall GDP = C + I + G + NX\n If investing is the same, while gov't spending is the same and net imports don't change, but Consumer consumption drops by 50%, how can GDP increase when one of the factors has suffered a 50% reduction? \n \n You actually haven't responded with anything besides a snide remark.",

GDP again is simply Y = C + G+ I + NX. \n \n When government spending increases, the change in Y is a factor of the change in G, all other parts held constant. \n \n Now your argument is clearly ignoring two key parts. Marginal propensity to consume & save and the simple gov't multplier. \n \n Let's say the MPC is .8, for every dollar spent, 80 cents are spent and 20 cents are saved. That means a 100 billion of gov't spending turns into 80 billion of spending in the second round. On top of that, 64 billion gets spent in the next round. The simple multplier is 1/(1-mpc). a .8 would result in a multipler of 5. For $100 billion in gov't spending $500 billion is generated in adduitional spending. When firms are paid, they must pay their workers. If the MPC is .8, that means .2 of their wages are saved and .8 goes back into spending to become another person's income and so on and so on. The money ends up in your pocket book. This is a reason why gov't should spend like mad during a recession.",

   "Taxing income stifles the desire to earn income (work for a living).\n\n \n True. Income taxes tend to lower the supply of labour by skewing the relative-gain from working (relative to leisure time). \n \n \nTaxing purchases merely adds to the cost of goods. \n\n \n No. It also lowers the demand for consumtion by skewing the relative cost of consumtion (relative to saving). \n \n \n It will eventually (and fairly quickly) produce a reduction in the cost of goods because the embedded taxes that we pay producers will disappear. \n\n \n This is not true either. If we do assume that employers pass on the entire cost of embedded taxes unto consumers, your assumption of income taxes stifling the desire to earn income doesn`t hold. You can`t have it both ways, the producer cannot pass on the entire costs for taxes to both consumers and workers.\n \n \nEven though (under the current proposal) we'd be paying 23% more in taxes, the overall price would be about the same as it is now.\n\n \n Why? Because the embedded taxes would disapear? That would mean that the real-wages would have to remain constant. You have gained nothing.\n \n \nThe big difference would be that people could keep ALL THE MONEY THEY EARN!\n\n \n The big difference is that the aggregated demand would experience a drastic shock.

The proposal sounds insane to me...\n \n Oh, and if you want to increase the savings rate, it`s easily \"fixed\" by increasing the interest rate.\n \n And yes, as Georged pointed out, investing in real estate and bussineses abroad would be very lucrative (as foreign purchases cannot be taxed).
