   "For those of you who are interested and would like to read about the dating controversies of the KBS Tuff, I do suggest that you consult The Talk Origins Archive. A search of the site will result in three links:\n \n The first is a discussion of Hindu Creationism. I don't know (and it isn't relevant to the issue) how Hinduism relates, but about half way down the article there is a discussion of dating methods and some of the problems with the Koobi Fora. Do a text search on \"KBS Tuff\" and you will hit the pertinent paragraphs. The second paragraph below that explains a major problem with all of the tuffs in the Koobi Fora, namely, they are not deposited from ash fall from a volcanic eruption but rather from ash being eroded and washed down to be deposited at lower altitudes.\n \n The second is an article about Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale. If you know nothing about the topic, you might want to read this. The part about the KBS Tuff is the Specific Examples: When Radiometric Dating \"Just Works\" (or not). A poor example. section. It also explains the problems with dating tuff from the Koobi Fora. That section specifically mentions an appendix to a book by Marvin L. Lubenow, \"Bones of Contention: A Creationist Assessment of Human Fossils\". What one can say about Lubenow is that he is one of the few creationists who have actually looked at hominid fossils. He does go on at some length in discussing the controversy but in the end plays creationist games.\n \n The third article is a feedback letter from Feb 2000. Again do a search for KBS Tuff. The letter is a good example of creationist understanding of radiometric dating.\n \n However, the best source that I have available is a book by Roger Lewin, \"Bones of Contention: Controversies in the Search for Human Origins,\" (yes, the major title is the same) who dedicates 50 pages to the dating controversy. It took me a bit to remember where I had read about this controversy. I checked several books before it came to me. I started reading the two chapters, the first dealing with the controversy, and the second with how the solution was worked out.\n \n It might be noted that no creationists were ever involved in the dating controversy. This event caused some bitter exchanges between Richard Leakey and Donald Johanson. They had been prevously quite friendly, but this was a rough spot. I'm not sure of their relationship now. I suspect that they are friendly, since ultimately Leakey has acknowledged the dating errors. What creationists are reporting is honest debate between honorable scientists. Like vultures, they swoop down after the slaughter and represent it for evidence of something. A perfect example is Ray Martinez. He demands that we refute something without telling us what it is that we should refute. Are we supposed to refute the fact that there are known problems in dating some strata? Why? The problems were reported by scientists and worked out by scientists - not one creationist was involved in reporting or solving any of the problems.\n \n So far I haven't found any mention of isochron dating being used on the KBS Tuff, but then I haven't finished reading the relevant parts of the two books (I have both). I would suspect that isochron dating would reveal the problem. It will be interesting to see if they did.\n \n The initial dating of the KBS Tuff was done by K/Ar dating. Even though it was more time consuming and more complex, Leakey was told that the resulting date would be more accurate than the newer Ar/Ar method.\n \n So I'll re-read those two chapters of Lewin's book, as well as the appendix to Lubenow's book and see if I can come up with some sort of summary. I'll try to report on the dating methods used and how the controversy was resolved.\n \n Still, I'm not sure what argument I'm supposed to refute since Ray never told us. I have no idea how a scientific dating controversy fits into the creationist/evolution debate. None of the dates from Koobi Fora are compatible with a 6,000 year old earth. Besides, the controversy is more than 30 years old. Why is Ray dwelling on the controversy and not the resolution? Could it be selective creationist editing? I wonder. Does Ray find a problem with the heliocentric theory since \"science\" (actually Biblical literalism) once declared that the earth was the center of the universe? Does Ray have a problem with the correction of errors or does he feel that all knowledge, once gained, is absolute and unchangeable forever?\n \n Nevertheless, hominid fossils of \"only\" 1.9 million years is still bad news for creationism. And even if they didn't turn out to be Homo as first claimed by Leakey, they were australopithecines, which is even worse news for creationism.\n \n By the way, Duo_Maxwell demonstrates more knowledge than I of radiometric dating methods. I have done some considerable reading on the topic and am informed by his posts.\n \n...this looks like a job for pandion.\n\n I appreciate it, but you flatter me. I am nothing more than a well read biologist. As you can tell, Duo is more knowledgeable about radiometric dating than I am.",

   "Pandion (responding to XXX-kissing): I appreciate it, but you flatter me. I am nothing more than a well read biologist. As you can tell, Duo is more knowledgeable about radiometric dating than I am.\n \n Pandion: So far I haven't found any mention of isochron dating being used on the KBS Tuff\n \n Ray Martinez: You are a well read biologist and you admit that you don't know that KBS Tuff was dated by the Isochron method by both the Berkeley and Fitch Teams ?\n \n LOL !\n \n IOW, Darwinian \"honesty\" is seen here to have successfully hidden this fact from the rank and file. But you CLAIM to be a \"well read biologist\" which means you are neither if you didn't know this generic fact as to which dating technique was used to date the Tuff.\n \n IOW, you are making a classic argument from ignorance.\n\n If you weren't such a XXXXX you would be aware that I wasn't making an argument. I don't carry tidbits about every rock that has ever been dated around in my head. I read the information to which I referred several years ago, the copyright is 1987 and as I recall I bought it shortly after publication. So, I can't say what methods were used, except for K/Ar, since that is the only one mentioned so far in my reading. As I said, I haven't finished reading the information.\n \nI suggest you do some more reading Mr. Biologist before making a further fool of yourself.\n\n That's what I said I was doing, dimwit. I said that I would reread the information.\n \nAs I said in the OP I do not debate links. But our biologist here has been shown to be a poor reader.\n\n As I said in my first post, \"For those of you who are interested and would like to read about the dating controversies of the KBS Tuff...\" You seem to have a reading problem. You can't tell that that wasn't addressed to you? In fact, if you read carefully you will be aware that nothing I said was addressed to you. It would be stupid to call you someone who is interested since you have already made it clear that you are not willing to learn.\n \nThe real reason biologist has ignored the OP call to debate and refute yourself is because he cannot, he is frustrated with the OP content and has had to defer to the evo mommy - Talk.Origins. This deferment = inability to refute the OP or Talk.Origins wouldn't be invoked in the first place.\n\n No. The real reason was that I was making some comment on how empty your post actually was and telling others where they might find some information with which to judge your stupidity.\n \nT.O. will only whitewash what happened at KBS Tuff and cover the pure fraud that went on here. T.O. is Darwinian = inability to be objective. How does anyone expect to receive accurate information about Darwinism from biased Darwinists ?\n\n Actually, you are upset because you don't like the information at T.O. and can't refute any of it. It reveals your stupidity.\n \nHere we have a compliment of Lubenow THEN an insult attached to \"the end\" (his conclusions) via saying Lubenow is a creationist. IOW, the conclusions are wrong because he is a creationist = classic ad hom attack/poisoning the well \"refutation\" attempting to undermine Lubenow's credibility in order to discredit the conclusions.\n\n I only mentioned a couple of facts about Lubenow. Like you, he misrepresents.\n \nI wonder if our biologist here will do the same to himself or Talk.Origins about their conclusions ?\n\n What are you talking about?\n \nAtheist Richard Milton in his 1997 book \"Shattering the Myths of Darwinism\" came to the same conclusions of Lubenow.\n\n Then I must not be too far off base. I'm not familiar with the book.\n \nOur biologist is ignoring the blantant fraud of KBS Tuff and asserting his own kind (Darwinists) are objective and any refutation is \"creationist\" = reliance on philosophy to \"refute\" while ignoring evidence when it goes against the credibility of Darwinists.\n\n I'm not sure who \"our\" biologist is. I know it's not me since I haven't ignored anything. I clearly told the readers here that I was still re-reading the pages that deal with the question. And I made no assertions except that I haven't finished reading but would do so and try to give a summary. I don't know what you are talking about.\n \nThats right.\n \n Only Darwinists to blame.\n\n Again you make senseless comments. What is that supposed to mean?\n \nI suggest you know something before entering a debate, and I request that you submit proof that you are a biologist.\n\n I always do try to inform myself about a topic before I enter a debate. I will in this case. You seem to have a severe reading problem since you seem to think that anyone has entered any debate here with you. But there is a problem. It still isn't clear to me what I am supposed to debate. In other words, do you have a point? The initial problems with the dating of the KBS tuff were apparent early on. For example, by 1973 at least 41 samples from the tuff had been dated and produced a wide range of dates. It isn't clear to me how Leakey and associates could have clung to their date, especially in the face of fossil suites from Omo and Olduvai (pigs, Equus, antelopes, and elephants) that compared quite closely to those at Koobi, but were younger and dated from tuff that was produced by the actual ash fall rather than reworked erosion material.\n \n So you can stop with the insults about how I haven't refuted your arguments. I didn't try simply because I don't remember the details of the controversy and simply because you haven't actually made a point, and you certainly haven't presented any evidence. When you do, be sure not to link any web sites. It would be moronic to violate your own rules.",

   "At the time, most Europeans accepted Archbishop Usher's declaration, made in 1658, that Earth was created on Sunday, October 23, 4004 b.c. at precisely 6:00 a.m.--a date extracted from the Bible by back-calculating begats and exercising a bit of imagination. British geologist Charles Lyell challenged this orthodox worldview when he published the first volume of his Principles of Geology in 1830. Based on a plethora of evidence collected primarily from his work in Italy, he was able to show that a mere 6,000 years could not possibly have allowed enough time for the great geologic processes displayed in the rock record. \n One critical component of the rock record was sedimentary rocks. By Lyell's time, the concept of sedimentary rocks was already well established: sediments laid down by erosional processes somehow, over time, solidified into rocks. Time was one of the unknowns of the process, but in Italy Lyell found a clear time reference. He noted that the ruins of the old Roman port of Classis were separated from the coast by five miles of mudflats, sediments laid down over 1,800 years. But the sediment remained loose, unlike the large formations of solidified sedimentary rock common everywhere. How long did it take for sediments to be turned into rock? Much longer, certainly, than the time since the Roman Empire. \n Thinking of time and geological processes, Lyell noticed other disturbing evidence. Sedimentary rocks lying hundreds of feet above sea level on the sides of a volcano in the Bay of Naples particularly caught his attention. These rocks contained fossils that resembled living species. To Lyell, it could only mean that the large volcano formed recently in geologic time if the sedimentary rocks resting on its side had no fossils of extinct species. \n Later, on the side of Mount Etna, a volcano on the island of Sicily, he discovered small cones formed during ash eruptions. These cones had existed as long as anyone in the region could remember. If no one had witnessed the formation of the small cones, then how long ago had Etna formed? He found the answer in layer after layer of lava flows, ash deposits, and buried cones in valleys exposed by water erosion along the sides of the mountain. He realized that the 10,000-foot volcano had grown from hundreds or perhaps thousands of small eruptions that must have occurred over millennia. \n But what really astounded Lyell was the limestone layer that clearly ran underneath Etna and across the plains surrounding the volcano. The limestone contained fossils of animals that were exactly the same as those living in the Mediterranean of his day. The limestone, in turn, was deposited on deeper sedimentary formations, layers that must have existed before the limestone was deposited on top. These older layers contained fossils of extinct animals. Mount Etna, ancient and enduring though it is in human terms, must be a recent geologic event, built on top of young limestone. \n These were the earliest inklings of evidence that geological processes take great expanses of time to run their course. Today we know that Mount Etna formed during the past 500,000 years through periodic and often violent eruptions. If we average out its growth to a towering 10,875 feet above the foundation limestone, Etna has grown at a rate of about 2.5 inches per 1,000 years. After slowly precipitating from seawater along the ocean floor over thousands of years, the underlying limestone was eventually pushed above sea level by tectonic forces. \n \n no link per request.\n \n saying Lyell was guessing is overstatement. He never estimated the Earth's age at what we accept today at any rate.",

The rate of deposition of sediment was also investigated, but there is no way to determine if such rates have been stable throughout time. British physicist, Lord William Thomson Kelvin, tried to estimate the age of the Sun and Earth by calculating the rate of cooling of the Sun. Assuming that both were originally molten and are cooling at a stable rate, he estimated that the Earth's crust was solidified between 20 and 40 million years ago.

To start, why does it matter if Velikovsky was an alleged athiest or not? It doesn't. What matters, is what his \"theories\" said. \n What he did was this: he looked at all the myths of ancient people, saw connections in the stories (like floods and stuff), and went under the assumption that they were literally true. Then, he made a whole bunch of ideas and explanations(like, Noah's flood was caused by proto-Saturn entering a nova state, and ejecting a lot of mass) to construct an account of what happened.\n \n IMO, he did what creationists do. Creationists start with an assumption and make up all this random cr a p to support it, instead of gathering physical data, and making a picture from that.\n \n Given that Velikovsky was actually NOT an expert in physics or astronomy, but was a psychoanalyst, I would have to question the validity and basis of his \"theories\".",

   "It has been soooo many years ago that I read Velikovsky that I remember very few of his idiotic assertions based on mythology and speculation. I do remember that his book was a good laugh - a perfect example of pseudoscience. Fortunately I was not scientifically illiterate when I read the book. As one knowledgeable person commented, \"The less one knows about science, the more plausible Velikovsky's scenario appears....\" That seems to be a perfect description of Ray. How on earth can anyone with any sort of scientific knowledge state that Velikovsky \"...proved the Bible was correct...?\" Doesn't \"proof\" have to have some basis in observable fact?\n \n Another festival of pseudoscience is Eric von Daniken. I also enjoyed his books. They are of equal quality to Velikovsky's work. He also \"proves\" the Bible correct in a similar manner to Velikovsky. I'm sure that Ray would be equally impressed with his pseudoscience.\n \n When I was a high school science teacher, both Velikovsky's and von Daniken's books were popular (Velikovsky's for the second time). Some of my students asked me about them and I took some class time to discuss some scientific principles - mostly a review of the 1st week of the class of what science is and how it works. I even referred them back to our classroom text for a discussion of the topic. While I was prepared to declare both books **** and tell why, I didn't. I asked my students to apply their knowledge and to think rationally while reading. Both books became comic relief to our classroom discussions. I was amazed at how those kids actually realized that they could take what they learned in school and apply it, and thus avoid becoming dupes of the irrational. We fell behind in the curriculum, but even those kids who weren't reading the books learned something. And since none of the discussion was subject to testing, and since their questions were mostly handled by other students, there was no threat of authority.\n \n Isn't it too bad that Ray didn't have a similar learning experience? He is still fooled by pseudoscience - make an assertion sound like science, and it's \"proof.\"",

Early geologists, Lyell in particular, simply \"guessed\" at the age of the earth, and there is no basis for their dates.\n \n Is this correct?

   "Well, I've read the story on the dating of the KBS tuff at Koobi Fora, and I don't feel up to summarizing it in any detail. The controversy went on for several years and involved a lot of people. The method used to date the tuff was primarily K/Ar, and these dates were done repeatedly. The initial date of 2.6 ma was from this method. Over the years, the newer Ar/Ar method was also used, as well as fission track dating and paleomagnetism. However, in all of the reading that I have done about the KBS tuff, there is no mention of isochron dating being done. I wonder why?\n \n Here is a summary of the datings done on KBS tuff samples. This was written by Karen Jensen on the asa discussion board.\n \nEarly attempts to date the KBS tuff (1969) gave an age of 212-230 million years which was immediately rejected as an extraneous argon age discrepancy, because of the presence of Australopithicine and other mammalian fossils beneath the tuff (Fitch & Miller 1970, Nature 226:226-8). The dating was complicated because the tuff is a water-transported mixture. But they did find an acceptable date, which was then confirmed by several \"independent methods\":\n \n In the early 1970's the KBS tuff was \"securely dated\" at 2.6 million years based on:\n \n - Vertebrate faunas -- Elephant, Suid (pig), Australopithicus, and tools\n (Maglio, 1972; Nature 239:379-85, Leaky, 1967-69, etc.)\n \n - Potassium-Argon dating -- selected crystals (K-Ar and Ar40-Ar39)\n (Fitch & Miller '70, Nature 226:226-8 and see 251:214)\n \n - Paleomagnetism -- polarity data, based on 247 samples below KBS tuff\n (Brock & Isaac, 1974, Nature 247:344-48)\n \n - Fission Track Dating -- involving uranium, noting possible reanealing\n (Hurford, 1974, Nature 249:236; '76, 263:738)\n \n In the mid 1970's Leaky's team found Skull 1470 below the KBS Tuff (Leaky,'73, Nature 242:447, National Geographic June, 1973 pp 819-829) and Leaky said, \"either we toss out this skull, or we toss out our theories of early man\". Skull 1470 was \"too modern\" to be found at that level, if the Australopithicenes (found both above and below the KBS tuff) were ancestral to modern man.\n \n Other anthropologists, notably Johanson's team at Berkeley, couldn't accept any claim of such modern hominids in strata dated almost 3 million years old. They tried to redate the KBS. It was a complex problem because the tuff is a slurry of volcanic debris. But they did find and publish a date that was suitable to them: 1.8 million years, based on:\n \n - Hominid Fossils -- Skull 1470 and other similar skulls below KBS tuff\n \n - Potassium-Argon (K-Ar) -- on pumice from the KBS tuff and Ar-Ar -- on selected feldspar crystals (Ar40-Ar39)\n (Curtis et al,1975, Nature 258:395 (& see 284:229,230 & 294:123)\n \n Then in the late 1970's, a remarkable thing happened. One by one (with much heated controversy apparent in the papers) the other \"independent methods\" re-evaluated their work in light of the new radiometric date, and confirmed the new age:\n \n - Paleomagnetism -- pinpointing a different polarity reversal, in light of the change in the K-Ar date\n (Hillhouse et al, 1977, Nature 265:411)\n \n - Vertebrate Faunas -- three suid (pig) species (based on teeth) suggesting possible phylogenetic branching and its timing in relationship to the new radiometric date\n (Cooke, 1978; Science 201:460-63 (&198:13-21)\n \n - Fission Track Dating -- (U-238 in zircon) emphasizing re-anealing, in light of the change in the accpeted K-Ar date\n (Gleadow, 1980, Nature 284:229-230)\n \n By 1980 there was a new \"remarkably concordant\" well-accepted radiometric date.\n\n I should mention that Jensen is a creationist and she is trying to make the point that the dates were adjusted according to the fossils. Her sequence of events is correct but her point isn't, at least not from the reading that I have done.\n \n Notice that she doesn't mention isochron dating by either team. I'm sure that Ray can support his assertion.\n \nRocks date fossils and fossils date rocks. This is what KBS Tuff ultimately relied upon.\n\n A blatant lie.\n \n Edit to add: Since Ray insists so on the use of isochron dating I feel he should give us an explanation of how it works. I wonder if he knows. Remarks like, \"KBS Tuff proved the Isochron method does not prevent the anomalous loss or gain of argon,\" that he made in post #8 lead me to believe that he doesn't know. No one ever claimed that isochron dating prevented the loss of argon.\n \n So Ray, give us a clear explanation of the principles behind isochron dating, how to produce the graphs and what they mean. Also, please explain what were the minerals that were dated from the KBS tuff that you claim were done by both teams. I'm sure that you must be aware that isochron dating with three minerals is barely sufficient.",

This was written by Karen Jensen on the asa discussion board.\n \n I should mention that Jensen is a creationist and she is trying to make the point that the dates were adjusted according to the fossils. Her sequence of events is correct but her point isn't, at least not from the reading that I have done.\n \n Notice that she doesn't mention isochron dating by either team. I'm sure that Ray can support his assertion.\n \n A blatant lie.\n \n Edit to add: Since Ray insists so on the use of isochron dating I feel he should give us an explanation of how it works. I wonder if he knows. Remarks like, \"KBS Tuff proved the Isochron method does not prevent the anomalous loss or gain of argon,\" that he made in post #8 lead me to believe that he doesn't know. No one ever claimed that isochron dating prevented the loss of argon.\n \n So Ray, give us a clear explanation of the principles behind isochron dating, how to produce the graphs and what they mean. Also, please explain what were the minerals that were dated from the KBS tuff that you claim were done by both teams. I'm sure that you must be aware that isochron dating with three minerals is barely sufficient.\n\n \n You are in a state of extreme humiliation like the limbless Monty Python Knight.\n \n The fact that you still don't know that the Isochron method was used at KBS Tuff means I will not waste my time on you.\n \n The fact that your evo friends have not called a taxi for you but have let you make a fool of yourself is also quite indicative of their integrity.\n \n Ray M.",

   "Got this off encarta. I think there may be some discussion of dating going on here. \n \n A Dendrochronology \n This method of dating events and conditions of the recent past is based on the number, width, and density of annual growth rings of long-lived trees. In the south-western United States, for example, a master tree-ring index has been constructed from the Douglas fir and bristlecone pine. This index enables dendrochronologists to date accurately events and climatic conditions of the past 3,000 to 4,000 years.\n \n B Varve Analysis One of the oldest methods employed for absolute age determination, varve analysis, was developed by Swedish scientists in the early 20th century. A varve is a sedimentary bed, or sequence of beds, deposited in a body of still water over the period of a year. Counting and correlation of varves have been used to measure the ages of Pleistocene glacial deposits. By dividing the rate of sedimentation in terms of units per year by the number of units deposited following a geological event, geologists can establish the age of the event in years.\n \n C Obsidian Hydration Dating Also referred to as hydration rind dating or obsidian dating, this method is used to calculate ages in years by determining the thickness of rims (hydration rinds) produced by water vapour slowly diffusing into freshly chipped surfaces on artefacts made of obsidian, or recent volcanic, glass. The method is applicable to types of glass which are 200 to 200,000 years old.\n \n D Thermoluminescence (TL) Dating This method is based on the phenomenon of natural ionizing radiation inducing free electrons in a mineral that can be trapped in defects of the mineral's crystal lattice structure. These trapped electrons escape as thermoluminescence (TL) when heated to a temperature below incandescence, so that by recording the TL of a mineral such as quartz and assuming a constant natural radiation level, the last drainage of the trapped electrons can be dated back to several hundred thousand years. In TL dating of pottery, for example, the specimen is heated until it glows with energy that has been stored ever since it was fired.\n \n E Radiometric Dating Radiometric techniques were developed after the discovery of radioactivity in 1896. The regular rates of decay for unstable, radioactive elements were found to constitute virtual \"clocks\" within the Earth's rocks.\n \n E1 Basic Theory \n Radioactive elements such as uranium (U) and thorium (Th) decay naturally to form different elements or isotopes of the same element. (Isotopes are atoms of any elements that differ in mass from that element, but possess the same general chemical and optical properties.)\n This decay is accompanied by the emission of radiation or particles (alpha, beta, or gamma rays) from the nucleus, by nuclear capture, or by ejection of orbital electrons. A number of isotopes decay to a stable product, a so-called daughter isotope, in a single step (for example, carbon-14), whereas others involve many steps before a stable isotope is formed. Multistep radioactive decay series include, for example, the uranium-235, uranium-238, and thorium-232 families. If a daughter isotope is stable, it accumulates until the parent isotope has completely decayed. If a daughter isotope is also radioactive, however, equilibrium is reached when the daughter decays as fast as it is formed.\n Radioactive decay may take different routes. Thus, if the isotope decays by alpha emission, it loses the two protons and two neutrons that make up an alpha particle; the atomic number (number of protons) is reduced by two and the atomic mass (number of nuclear particles, or nucleons) by four. In beta decay, or electron loss, a radioactive nucleus can gain or lose one unit of electric charge without changing the number of nucleons. More radioactive substances are beta-ray emitters than alpha-ray emitters.\n A third important mode of decay involves electron capture; the nucleus of an atom absorbs an electron, which unites with a proton of the nucleus to form a neutron. Thus, the atomic number is reduced by one, but the mass of the nucleus remains unchanged. The fourth mode of decay, gamma radiation, consists of the emission of waves of electromagnetic energy.\n Scientists describe the radioactivity of an element in terms of half-life-the time the element takes to lose half of its activity through decay. This covers an extraordinary range of time, from a few microseconds to billions of years. At the end of the period constituting one half-life, half of the original quantity of the radioactive element has decayed; after another half-life, half of what was left is halved again, leaving one quarter of the original quantity, and so on. Every radioactive element has its own half-life; for example, that of carbon-14 is 5,730 years and that of uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years.\n Radiometric dating techniques are based on radio-decay series with constant rates of isotope decay. Once a quantity of a radioactive element becomes part of a growing mineral crystal, that quantity will begin to decay at a steady rate, with a definite percentage of daughter products in each time interval. These \"clocks in rocks\" are the geologists' timekeepers.\n \n E2 Carbon-14 Method Radiocarbon dating techniques, first developed by the American chemist Willard F. Libby and his associates at the University of Chicago in 1947, are frequently useful in deciphering time-related problems in archaeology, anthropology, oceanography, pedology, climatology, and recent geology.\n Through metabolic activity, the level of carbon-14 in a living organism remains in constant balance with the level in the atmosphere or some other portion of the Earth's dynamic reservoir, such as the ocean. Upon the organism's death, carbon-14 begins to disintegrate at a known rate, and no further replacement of carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide can take place. The rapid disintegration of carbon-14 generally limits the dating period to approximately 50,000 years, although the method is sometimes extended to 70,000 years. Uncertainty in measurement increases with the age of the sample.\n Although the method is suited to a variety of organic materials, accuracy depends on the half-life to be used, variations in levels of atmospheric carbon-14, and contamination. (The half-life of radiocarbon was redefined from 5,570 \u00b1 30 years to 5,730 \u00b1 40 years in 1962, so some dates determined earlier required adjustment; and due to radioactivity more recently introduced into the atmosphere, radiocarbon dates are calculated from AD 1950.) The radiocarbon timescale also contains other uncertainties, and errors as great as 2,000 to 5,000 years may occur. Postdepositional contamination, which is the most serious problem, may be caused by percolating groundwater, incorporation of older or younger carbon, and contamination in the field or laboratory.\n \n E3 Potassium-Argon Method The decay of radioactive potassium isotopes to argon is widely used for dating rocks. (The decay of potassium-40 to calcium-40 that also takes place is not useful.) Geologists are able to date entire rock samples in this way, because potassium-40 is abundant in micas, feldspars, and hornblendes. Leakage of argon is a problem if the rock has been exposed to temperatures above 125\u00b0 C (257\u00b0 F), because the age of the rock will then reflect the last episode of heating rather than the time of original rock formation.\n \n E4 Rubidium-Strontium Method Used to date ancient igneous and metamorphic terrestrial rocks as well as lunar samples, this method is based on disintegration by beta decay of rubidium-87 to strontium-87. The method is frequently used to check potassium-argon dates, because the strontium daughter element is not diffused by mild heating, as is argon.\n \n E5 Methods Involving Thorium-230 Thorium ratio methods are used to date older oceanic sediments beyond the range of radiocarbon techniques. Uranium in seawater eventually decays to the thorium isotope, thorium-230 (also called ionium), which is precipitated into ocean-floor sediments. Because it has been undergoing decay longer, scientists can detect a decrease in quantity in higher levels, and a timescale can be developed in this way.\n Thorium-230, part of the uranium-238 decay series, has a half-life of 80,000 years. Protactinium-231, derived from uranium-235, has a half-life of 34,300 years. Both parent elements are precipitated in the same proportions but at different rates. The ratio of the two changes regularly with time, showing greater differences in the quantity of undecayed parent isotopes in older sediments.\n The ionium-thorium age method, applied to deep-sea sediments formed during the last 300,000 years, is based on the assumption that the initial ionium content of accumulating sediments has remained constant for the total section under study and is not derived from uranium decay; the age of the sample depends on this ionium excess, which decreases with time.\n In the ionium-deficiency method, the age of fossil shell or coral from 10,000 to 250,000 years old is based on the growth of ionium towards equilibrium with uranium-238 and uranium-224, which entered the carbonate shortly after its formation or burial. Similar disequilibrium relationships can be used to assess ages of carbonates in soils; this method is a complement to carbon-14 methodology.\n \n E6 Methods Involving Lead Lead-alpha age is estimated by spectrographically determining the total lead content and alpha-particle activity (uranium-thorium content) of zircon, monazite, or xenotime concentrates. The lead-alpha, or Larsen, method is applied to rocks younger than Precambrian. In the uranium-lead method, age in years is calculated for geological material based on the known radioactive decay rate of uranium-238 to lead-206 and of uranium-235 to lead-207. Coupled with decay rates for thorium-232 to lead-208, three independent ages may be obtained for the same sample. The determined lead-206 and lead-207 ratios can be converted into a so-called lead-lead age. The method is most applicable to materials Precambrian in age. Additionally, a uranium-uranium age, derived from the ratio of uranium-235 to uranium-238, can be calculated as a by-product of uranium-thorium-lead dating.\n \n E7 Fission-Track Dating The fission-track method, also known as spontaneous fission-track dating, involves the paths, or tracks, of radiation damage made by nuclear particles in a mineral or glass by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238 impurities. Age in years is calculated by determining the ratio of spontaneous fission-track density to that of induced fission tracks. The method works best for micas, tektites, and meteorites.

That's how children would approach the topic.\n \n It would seem to me that what you're ultimately doing is not debating the science of creationism vs evolution, geology, etc... the KBS Tuff itself is irrelevent to your stance, you're attempting a philosophical debate of religion vs \"Darwinists\". \n \n That topic might be better addressed in the Religion forum. Feel free to start it there if that's your bent. We'll follow you over.\n \n Please define a \"Darwinist\".\n \n I'm not sure how quoting Bible verse is relevent to dating the KBS Tuff. I'm also sure that you're well aware that quoting the Bible is not proof of the Bible or God, that would be like me quoting Lyell as proof that Lyell is correct.\n \n I can very readily deal with the fact that \"God\" is mad at me, just like I'm sure you're not too upset to learn that Lyell is furious with you and is going to smite you.\n \n As to proof of dating - shall we examine radiometric dating as a method of determining the age of rocks? You've been presented with it already, and chose to ignore it. It is more than capable of independently dating the age of rock, and can do it accurately and repeatably, no other \"info\" is required. I'm willing to go into the topic in detail if you are.

   "Well, it seems that Ray's chubby little legs carried him far enough away from the question that he can pretend that he didn't avoid it. So let's bring it to the top again.\n \n Ray Martinez made the claim that isochron dating was used by both the Fitch and Miller as well as the Berkeley team in dating material from the KBS tuff. He taunted me because I stated that I had not found that in my reading on the topic. Finally, when I asked that he explain how isochron dating works and that he support his assertions that the method had been used by both teams, he ran away, stating that he was no longer goin to deal with me because I was unaware of an obscure fact of his choosing. Why would anyone but interested parties know what specific dating methods were used by any individuals? If it is important, shouldn't the information be easily accessible?\n \n Well, I never claimed that either team didn't use isochron dating. What I did state is that I have been unable to find any reference to it, in the 50 page discussion of the controversy by Roger Lewin (anthropologist and former editor with New Scientist and Science, and former associate of and colaborator with Richard Leakey - I never would have suspected from reading the book) in his book, Bones of Contention, in the 19 page discussion of the same topic by Marvin Lubenow in his book of the same name, or in the time-line by Karen Jensen (a creationist). None of those sources, or any others that I have looked at on the internet mention the use of isochron dating in reference to the KBS tuff.\n \n So my question is, what's the deal? Why is it that Ray can't stand up like a man and support his assertions.\n \n First, just so that we can be assured that Ray knows what he is talking about, I request that he explain the process of isochron dating for us. Once understood, isochron dating seems quite simple, but the ideas are difficult to grasp. I'm sure that Ray understands the technology and can explain it for us. I understand the process but am hard pressed to present an intelligible explanation of the process.\n \n Second, I request that Ray cite the literature that details the use of isochron dating on the KBS tuff by the Fitch/Miller team and the Berkeley team. Lewin's book gives specific references to published scientific papers. As far as I can tell, the only dating methods used on the KBS tuff were K/Ar, Ar/Ar, fission track, and paleomagnetism.\n \n So if Ray is correct, why is he unwilling to answer the above challenges? If isochron dating was used, then documentation from published peer reviewed literature is easily accesible. I just can't find it. That is my only claim. I don't claim that it never happened, but where is it?\n \n So I'm waiting for an explanation that demonstrates that Ray knows how isochron dating works and references to the scientific literature that report the results of isochron dating.\n \n Ball's in your court, Ray. That's if you have any to begin with.",

   "Pandy:\n\n Do you have a reading problem? That's pandion.\n \nYou are evading the points of my topic.\n\n You haven't made any points. It has been explained to you several times. I have searched and can find no references to the use of isochron dating in reference to the KBS Tuff. When you can verify that, then maybe we can work on trying to figure out what your point is.\n \nAll because you embarrassed yourself over the fact that you didn't know the Isochron method was used at KBS Tuff.\n\n Why should I be embarrassed? Are you completely stupid? Why would I carry around in my head the dating methods used on every paleontological site that ever was? If isochron dating was used, so what? My point is that I can find no reference to it. However, when I don't know something then I have the capability of looking it up to verify the facts. In my world, when someone makes a point and I question it because I am unable to find supporting information, they graciously furnish the references. To question the work of others in the practice of science is normal. That is why scientific papers usually have a section entitled \"methodology.\" If someone writes a paper about their work in radiometric dating of some site, they usually even mention the method in the title of the paper.\n \nIsochron was touted as the method which ensured anomalous loss or gain of argon would not happen.\n\n No it's not. No dating method can ensure that anomalous loss or gain of argon will not happen. You misunderstand completely. You are quite confused.\n \n Now I've been checking some references to the KBS Tuff and East Africa. For example:\n \n Fitch F.J. Miller J.A. (1969) Age determinations on feldspar from the Lower Omo Basin. Nature 222:1143. Notice that it only mentions dating of feldspar and the paper only mentions K/Ar dating in the paper.\n \n Bishop W.W. Miller J.A. Fitch F.J. (1969) New potassium-argon age determinations relevant to the Miocene fossil mammal sequence in East Africa. Am J Sci 267:669-699. Only one dating method mentioned, K/Ar. These are the dates from the Omo site that were compared to subsequent dating at Koobi Fora.\n \n Fitch F.J. Miller J.A. (1970) Radiometric age determinations of Lake Rudolf artefact site. Nature 226:226-228. This is the first controversial paper. The dating method was also K/Ar.\n \n Fitch F.J. Hooker P.J. Miller J.A. (1976) 40-Ar/39-Ar dating of the KBS Tuff in Koobi Fora Formation, East Rudolf, Kenya. Nature 263:740-744. Notice that there is not mention of isochron dating in the title, and guess what, there is none in the paper itself.\n \n So none of the relevant papers at the time mentioned the use of isochron dating. But how about others who also dated material from the KBS Tuff?\n \n I guess I could go on and look up papers by Curtis et al (1975), Drake et al (1980), or McDougall. I think I wouldn't be able to find any use of isochron dating in the relevant time frame in those papers. McDougall specifically states in the titles of his papers that he used K/Ar dating in the first (1980) and 40-Ar/39-Ar (1981) in the second.\n \n In short, you have yet to show that any discussion of isochron dating is relevant and you have failed to demonstrate that you actually understand what isochron dating is. For example, what minerals were dated (ash, lapilli, pumice, zircons, feldspar)? There are various methods to use isochron dating, but all of them involve multiple minerals and/or multiple dating methods to produce at least 3 plots. What was used on the KBS Tuff? Was 87-Sr/86-Sr v. 87-Rb/86-Sr used? How about U/Pb? I guess not since they don't have anything to do with escaping Argon and you seem to think that that is important. \n \nBut the Fitch and Berkeley Teams produced scatter from one half million to 17.5 million years in descrepancy.\n \n Why Pandy ?\n\n That's pandion, idiot. Can't you read?\n \n By the way, the question has been asked and answered. But I am still having difficulty in figuring out your point since Fitch et al certainly didn't use isochron dating (please see papers above for verification).\n \nThe final accept date was based on published dates.\n\n What are you talking about? What do you mean by \"published dates.\" All of the dates were published. You are actually pretty much of a scientific illiterate, aren't you?\n \nAnd we know published dates were built upon guesses by the likes of a Charles Lyell.\n\n I was not aware that Charles Lyell every tried to date the KBS Tuff. Please give me a reference to that work. Personally, I think such remarks by you demonstrate profound stupidity. At best, total ignorance of science.\n \nMy point: You God-damn evos have no idea how old anything is.\n\n Then why don't you present some evidence to that effect? You seem to be embarrassed by your ignorance.\n \nRocks date fossils and fossils date rocks = \"circular database of self-fulfilling predictions.\"\n\n Nope. Possibly if you actually took a paleontology course you might understand. You seem to have confused relative and absolute dating. Again, you demonstrate extreme ignorance of the science involved.\n \nWhat EXTERNAL criteria checks the accuracy of published dates ?\n\n What published dates? You keep talking about \"published dates\" as if there is some sacred book somewhere that must be followed. How empty headed!\n \nI know the answer but I will wait until you reply.\n\n Obviously you don't. I'm still waiting for you to support your assertion about the use of isochron dating by Fitch et al in the relevant time period. I'm still waiting for you to show that you understand what isochron dating is. I'm still waiting for you to tell us which minerals and which isotopes were plotted in the isochron. Your failure to support your assertions is a sure sign that you are wrong and you know you are wrong.\n \n I don't have an ax to grind in this. I don't care whether isochron dating was used or not. The problem is, as I have explained before, I can't find any paper that reports it and you don't seem to be able to support your assertion. I would like to read the paper to see if I can figure out what point you are trying to make. Your presentation is confused in the extreme, compounded by your scientific illiteracy and your childish behavior.\n \n Please refrain from childishly referring to me as \"Pandy.\" My handle is pandion.",

As I explained, I didn't ask the questions and only responded to Close_slave_can's inadequate answers. The only one he got right was the one about six mechanisms of evolution, three that tend to increase genetic variation and three that tend to decrease it. And now that I look back on what he said, he actually got 5 out of 6 right. The 6th is debatable. He got (+) mutation, geneflow, recombination, (-) natural selection, and genetic drift. However, slave stated that the 6th mechanism is non-random mating. I think I was in error in recognizing that as correct. It is at least, very debatable. Slave is confusing the question that asked him to state the Hardy-Weinberg equation with the question about mechanisms. He has crossed his theories, I suppose because he fails to understand either.\n \n The real 6th mechanism is sexual selection. That may be non-random mating, but it is not the \"same argument\" as natural selection. That is a gross error of understanding. Hardy-Weinberg equation is based on an infinite and randomly interbreeding population, without migration or emigration, without natural selection, and without genetic drift (which is a function of population size).\n \n Now I understand that sexual selection is one cause of non-random mating. I also recognize that there may be other less obvious reasons. So maybe non-random mating is a better statement of the mechanism. I'll have to consider that.",
