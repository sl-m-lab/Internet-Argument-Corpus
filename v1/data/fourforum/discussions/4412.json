(Though, a 'long period of time' is quite subjective. And in reality, the bible has been around for only a very small fraction of human history.)\n 2) \"...and [scripture was written] by many who were inspired by God.\"\n --< Circular reasoning here... this is supposed to be the conclusion you are supporting. (Which brings us back to --< How can we verify that the authors were inspired by God?)\n 3) \"It presents the followers of Christ in an honest light.\"\n --< And how do you propose we independently verify this statement? It is conceivable that the bible does not present the followers of Christ in an honest light. It is conceivable that the alleged followers of Christ did not even exist in physical reality.\n 4) \"If it were intended to decieve it would represent them as looking perfect.\" \n --< Pure conjecture. It is just as reasonable to believe that 'Satan' could have anticipated that we wouldn't believe the stories if they were made to look 'perfect,' so Satan made them appear fragile and failing.\n 5) \"Why? Because that is what humans do to stories. We present ourselves as good as possible (or at least our immediate interests).\"\n --< I have already shown in my previous post that this is actually reason to suspect that perhaps the characters in the bible are not historical characters.\n 6) \"...David, Peter, John, Abraham, Jacob, Paul, etc... are shown as fragile failing humans who love God. This would not be the way the evil one would do it.\"\n --< Pure conjecture. How do you know how 'the evil one' would do it? Perhaps 'the evil one' has you fooled, hook, line, and sinker...\n 7) \"He would portray them as doing everything perfect in order to convince you and me that we could do the same thing.\"\n --< Again, pure conjecture. Isn't it obvious that Satan wouldn't do it the way you suggest... you'd see right through that ploy. :)",

Mithra was supposedly born when he emerged from a rock; he was carrying a knife and torch and wearing a phrygian cap. He battled first with the sun and then the primeval bull, which then became the ground of life for the human race.\" - Norman Geisler\n \n As Scholars Geisler, McKenzie, and Ronald Nash have deduced from research, it was only AFTER the resurrection of Christ that Mithraism began to take on the numerous characteristics of the Biblical Christ. Before that date these characteristics were not found.\n \n \"Allegations of an early Christian dependence on Mithraism have been rejected on many grounds.

   "Your welcome to do that for this question certainly. The question is about the bible though and whether or not it is inspired by God. If it is inspired by God then it is legitimate to state that it is the revelation of God. The assumption is that God exists in both cases. If it is not inpired by God, one must still assume that god exists or there is no topic. Trebor, you are off base on that fallacy.\n\n \n \n No, I am not. The assumption is that the bible is inspired by god, because it says so in the bible. \n \n You do not consistant about what is in the bible with the other people that believe in 'spiritual discernment'.

   "Howdy. The other so-called \"savior gods\" don't measure up to what we see in Christ. Here's a sample of why they don't in the following link:\n \n http://www.geocities.com/metagetics/JCMyth_1.html\n \n In addition, people try to say Christianity \"borrowed\" from Mithraism.\n \n Did Christianity Steal From Mithraism?\n \n \"We do know that Mithraism, like its mystery competitors, had a basic myth. Mithra was supposedly born when he emerged from a rock; he was carrying a knife and torch and wearing a phrygian cap. He battled first with the sun and then the primeval bull, which then became the ground of life for the human race.\" - Norman Geisler\n \n As Scholars Geisler, McKenzie, and Ronald Nash have deduced from research, it was only AFTER the resurrection of Christ that Mithraism began to take on the numerous characteristics of the Biblical Christ. Before that date these characteristics were not found.\n \n \"Allegations of an early Christian dependence on Mithraism have been rejected on many grounds. Mithraism had no concept of the death and resurrection of its god and no place for any concept of rebirth - at least during its early stages.... During the early stages of the cult, the notion of rebirth would have been foreign to its basic outlook.... Moreover, Mithraism was basically a military cult.

I am sure that the 'borrowing' is a two way street.. but Christianity did borrow from the cultures around them.",

   ":So in the case of claming to manifest powers Christianity isn't special.\n\n That's right. There are many soothsayers, witch doctors, witches, etc., that can chant some magical spell and cause all sorts of manifestations.\n \n One example - and I'll make it short:\n I found a clump of hair on the bed of my welding rig one afternoon. (this was 20 or so years ago) I had my welding gloves on and just picked it up to examine it. The person that had combed his hair had become distracted and had left it balled up there to go perform some small task. I was still examining it to determine whether it was from man or animal when the guy came running over begging for it. I snickered, ignorant of his carelessness. He actually fell to his knees and begged me to give it back. Really.\n I ask him (with another snicker) why. He then went into the whole story of how one of the voodooists (is that a word?) had taken a lock of his hair some years earlier and had \"put a spell\" on him. Of course I didn't believe it and gave him back the lock of hair.\n Later, that same afternoon his foreman came over and told me that the story was true and that he believed it because he was there when it happened. A woman with voodoo powers had actually taken the hair and had fashioned a \"voodoo doll\" with it or as part of it. She used it to cause physical harm and to cause his car to go dead when it reached the city limits of Pickensville, Mississippi. The foreman was in the car when it died at the city limits sign and when the victim began to have stomach pains. He eventually pushed the car out of the city limits, cranked it and they went the other way. He was as serious as one could be when telling me. Hard to believe, huh?\n \nEven if we accept said powers exist they could be attributed to 'psychic powers' - a proposition arguably as plausible as the powers coming from 'God'.\n\n Exactly.

The evil its states will indeed be evil.\n \n Personally, I have not seen fallacy in the Bible. That's not to say that the Bible does not speak of it, however.\n \n Peter wrote that God has given us \"exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust\" 2 Peter 1:3-4 (NKJV). These promises unlock our potential to become the new persons God made us to be and to escape the corruption of sin. Paul confirmed our right to claim God's promises in 2 Corinthians 1:20 (NIV): \"For no matter how many promises God has made, they are \"Yes\" in Christ. And so through him the \"Amen\" is spoken by us to the glory of God.\" \n Here are a few examples of the promises I was referring to, how the \"power of God\" can be manifested:\n God will meet our needs when we give generously (Philippians 4:10-19) \n God will establish us and protect us from evil (2 Thessalonians 3:3, 1 John 5:18) \n All things are possible with God \n Faith without doubt has the power to move mountains (Mark 11:23) \n Submit yourself to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you (James 4:7) \n All things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28) \n All who live godly in Christ will suffer persecution (2 Timothy 3:1-2) \n Jesus will give us rest (Matthew 11:28) \n We are blessed when we trust in the Lord and he is good (Psalm 34:8) \n Those who hope in the Lord shall renew their strength (Isaiah 40:31) \n \n There's more, but this is what I was referring to.

They are ruled by a Pope who thinks he's Christ's representative on earth when there's no mention of such a person in bible.\n\n Jesus said, \"You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.\" The pope is simply Peter's successor. So it IS a matter of interpreting the bible -- I'm certain you don't interpret that passage the same way, or else you would recognize the Bishop of Rome as Christ's Vicar on earth as Roman Catholics do. \n \n That's probably material for another thread, but the point I'm attempting to make is that we don't have any objective way to determine which way is the 'right' way to interpret the bible. And, of course, we have no objective way to determine whether it was even inspired by God.\n \n \nAs I stated above the disagreement with Roman Catholics is more about their practices which cannot be found even in their own bible. That is what drove me away from them, when they couldn't answer my questions. They actually became hostile with me and told me I shouldn't question anything. \n\n This behavior is not unique to Roman Catholics, but rather is a typical human response when an individual feels threatened. You had an experience which you perceived to be less than positive with some particular individuals who happened to be Roman Catholic. If you continued searching, you would have found individuals that responded much differently to your questions. And there are certainly individuals under other labels (including the generic 'Christian' label) that would have responded to you with equal hostility. I guarantee you that there are answers to your questions. (Feel free to start a separate thread with a list of whatever your unanswered questions were.)\n \n \nWe do always bring it back to the bible. We'd go to the elders because they could maybe shed some light on the issue and help us to see what we did not see before. \n\n In other words, the elders would be offering a different perspective or different opinion on the same scripture from that which you understood previously. True, the elders of a particular church have likely spent considerable time studying & learning about the bible. But their understanding is still a subjective understanding. Evidence of this fact is that there could be elders of a different Christian denomination that have studied even more that have a different opinion -- which is sometimes a mutually exclusive opinion. (In other words, they cannot logically both be 'right.')\n \n \nIf I took your view of things, no one's opinion would be worth anything whether you're dealing with the bible, law,doctors etc.. Would I go to a doctor when I really need a lawyer, I think not. So, why would I go to someone of another faith for answers. \n\n When you are dealing with objective knowledge, you would likely go to someone who has studied and researched the particular topic you are interested in. If it is truly objective knowledge, then you should be able to find the same answer from multiple sources... and an expert in the field will likely be able to give you that objective answer more quickly and thoroughly than a non-expert in the field. \n \n However, even among 'experts' you could get different opinions when there is not enough objective knowledge in a particular area to answer the question definitively... or in the case of subjective opinions such as how to interpret the bible.\n \n Individuals (perhaps especially elders or 'experts') from another faith background could give you insights that you have not considered up to this point in your life journey. It could be an eye-opening experience. Why close your mind to the myriad possibilities that exist and focus on one possibility that you have no way to verify?",

   "This Lucifer Corruption is getting a might Stephen Kingish for me to be honest.\n\n \n ;)\n \n \nIf Lucifer is giving the orders then he indeed is God. Right? Nothing has changed as far as I know. Whoever it was that started this is making sure it's getting finished in the same format. If Lucifer suddenly killed God and took over, maybe he's afraid to change it.\n\n \n Lucifer just had to modify or corrupt something in the Bible rather than actually create it in it's entirety or 'kill God'.\n \n \nClaim is the operative word here. The Bible itself reads the way it has always read. I blame mankind for the stupidity, not the Holy Spirit. In Waxy's thread \"Benny Hinn\" it's obvious that some people claim that the Holy Spirit (or at least nine different entities ) have spoken through them concerning God (or gods). Since scripture cannot explain in a sufficient manner, then all I can say is, that ain't what I've read in the Holy Bible.\n\n \n So there's massive proportions of the people who claim to be 'Christian' in the world who are either demon corrupted, or are being miss lead by fallen Angels?\n \n Having suggested this do you feel empathy for non-christians who feel very disillusioned with the various Christian churches?\n \n \nMankind also has a great desire to have what they can't get, or get what they can't have - depending on your region. It seems to be programmed in us.\n\n \n 'Programmed' by God?\n \n \nMoney, women, power, etc., it all boils down on what we want and how we go about getting it. If it takes killing our brothers, we don't mind - to hell with God.\n Can't blame God for that either.\n\n \n I don't see how this answers my question - are you suggesting all those who suffered evil in their lives are not true christians?\n \n Are you suggesting if the evil is perpetuated by man God doesn't consider it evil? Seems a little odd if it's this reason...\n \n \n\n I think if you slipped off your center just a little you'd be begging for food, so would I or anyone else. God created the earth to be inhabited by competent people - those who do have should give to those who don't, and then teach them how to survive, then how to live.\n Then there are those that are \"supposed\" to spread the Gospel so that all mankind can have a more abundant life.\n It is our responsibility to love our neighbor, to clothe the naked, to feed the hungry. We were given that responsibility long ago...but have yet to perform it fully.\n Can't blame Him for our failure.\n\n \n I don't see how this answers the question - why doesn't God heed the prayers of the most holy human servant on Earth today to provide food and aid for those in need?\n \n If faith can move mountains why does it not bring rain to the sun scorched earth of Africa? Why cannot it enrich crops so they might grow for those faithful who are starving and praying for deliverance? Why has the prayers of the most holy mortal servant of God whom asks Him to help said African people go without being granted?\n \n The Bible says if you have faith God will provide despite others actions -\n \n \n\n God will establish us and protect us from evil (2 Thessalonians 3:3, 1 John 5:18) \n\n \n \n But, a Christian is a Christian. Those who claim to be are a dime a dozen. Why do you think God is so hated these days? It's not because He's given folks a reason, it's because self-proclaimed Christians have given those that are not Christians, many reasons. \n\n \n God doesn't draw bad feelings just for those reasons it's because of his inaction despite what is claimed in the Bible. The Bible says God will protect us from evil if we have faith in him but it is evident in my eyes that there are many Christians who suffer evil despite this pledge.\n \n \nBut, back to the analogy: If two people of differing beliefs were filled with the Holy Spirit there would not be a conflict, because in my belief and according to scripture, He would then show them the truth and they would be like-minded. That goes for the two priests, also. The Bible says that if we continue in the Spirit there would be no further disagreement.\n\n \n The purpose of the two priests with differing opinions is to make sure that one of them is actually holy and able to exorcise evil with the authority of Jesus.\n \n I'd love to do the experiment I propose to see whether they do indeed end up agreeing after the exorcisms - I presume you'd say they would?",

   ";)Lucifer just had to modify or corrupt something in the Bible rather than actually create it in it's entirety or 'kill God'.\n\n Wouldn't work. He'd either have to be all there is or he'd have to commit murder.\n \nSo there's massive proportions of the people who claim to be 'Christian' in the world who are either demon corrupted, or are being miss lead by fallen Angels?\n\n Not misled, but like me, have allowed our lives to become entangled with other things a little too much to stay hooked. It's then that they (we) need to keep from saying, \"God said...\", or \"This is what the Bible says...\" They (we) need to realize our limits and turn loose of the natural, or, as scripture tells us, to crucify the flesh daily.\n \n On the other hand there are those that have fallen prey to the powers of darkness and retain their religious stature by name only. These are the dangerous ones, and some never give it another thought.\n \nHaving suggested this do you feel empathy for non-christians who feel very disillusioned with the various Christian churches?\n\n Yes, I do. I see many who have suffered needlessly by absentminded Christians. I also see many who have been hurt by said members and contribute it to God. That's what hurts...all the way around, IMO.\n \n'Programmed' by God?\n\n No, it's a human thing. Like pointing birds is a bird dog thing.\n \nI don't see how this answers my question - are you suggesting all those who suffered evil in their lives are not true christians?\n\n Of course not. How in the world did you come to that conclusion?\n \nAre you suggesting if the evil is perpetuated by man God doesn't consider it evil? Seems a little odd if it's this reason...\n\n Seems odd indeed, doesn't it? I said nothing of the kind and thought I had pretty much laid it out.\n \nI don't see how this answers the question - why doesn't God heed the prayers of the most holy human servant on Earth today to provide food and aid for those in need?\n\n Heed the prayer, like do our bidding? He won't do that. We are told how to pray and even walked through it by Jesus himself. It is not that our prayers are not getting answered, it's that we pray for things we ought not to. Pray for God to feed the hungry? No, that's not what God said. Pray that we may be able to take care of each other. That's what we're to pray for.\n \nIf faith can move mountains why does it not bring rain to the sun scorched earth of Africa? Why cannot it enrich crops so they might grow for those faithful who are starving and praying for deliverance? Why has the prayers of the most holy mortal servant of God whom asks Him to help said African people go without being granted?\n\n There was a thread here, and you can do a search if you wish, but the gist of it was - How about the storms and famines, and earthquakes and such?\n God did not create the earth to be this way. Because of sin, it became this way. In the time before this earth-age there were no storms, there were no floods, no earthquakes. True north was true north, and there was a protective barrier around the earth. When Satan was cast from Heaven with his army it destroyed the earth that once was and we now have what we have. God could have done it different, but because of His gift to us of free-will He needed to leave it alone until we could make up our mind whether we wanted to remain with Him or go with Satan. In doing so, the earth also had to go through the process. He's not going to stop the earth's processes just because we're too lazy to perform our responsibilities.\n \nThe Bible says if you have faith God will provide despite others actions\n\n And He does despite our weak attempt at placing ourselves in position to receive it.\n \nGod doesn't draw bad feelings just for those reasons it's because of his inaction despite what is claimed in the Bible.\n\n That is your opinion.\n \nThe Bible says God will protect us from evil if we have faith in him but it is evident in my eyes that there are many Christians who suffer evil despite this pledge.\n\n The Bible says we will suffer evil and will have to endure to the end, no matter what ordeals, trials, and tribulations we face.\n \nThe purpose of the two priests with differing opinions is to make sure that one of them is actually holy and able to exorcise evil with the authority of Jesus.\n \n I'd love to do the experiment I propose to see whether they do indeed end up agreeing after the exorcisms - I presume you'd say they would?\n\n Of course I do.",

God is much more powerful than Satan. You ever hear of Satan resurrecting the dead? Why does Satan always have to ask for God's permission to do anything? Why does Satan cower at the mere mention of God? Equal, I think not. \n \n God's light, lights even the darkest corner.

Some of the good things are: We help those who are in need, we help out in the community, we have a good fellowship, where we can share with fellow christians etc.\n \n You've seen everything you listed firsthand, just how old are you???\n \n I don't know about changing someone's name but, people change their names all time for various reason's.\n \n I can tell you you're hating the wrong person if you blame Jesus for all of this.",

Are you going to say he didn't? \n \n \n \n It doesn't matter if the person speaking the rhetoric actually believed it, but rather if the people who the rhetoric was directed at accepted it, and acted upon it. IN the case of Hitlers rhetoric, it was. \n \n Here's something else Hitler said:\n \n \"Ill make these damned priests feel the power of the state in a way they would never have believed possible. For the moment, I'm just keeping my eye on them: if I ever have the slightest suspicion that they are getting dangerous, I will shoot the lot of them...........This filthy reptile (Christianity) raises its head whenever there is a sign of weakness in the state and must therefore be stamped on.......\" \n from Hitler : A Study in Tyranny: Alan Bullock.\n \n If in the context of Hitler's actual behaviour and what is known about his motives, psychology, etc., you still choose to believe that he encouraged or even led Christian extremists in the persecution of the Jews etc., that's not my particular concern. I am not a Christian, but I am interested in the truth.\n\n \n My quote is not out of context - it demonstrates Hitler's anti-Christian sentiments.

   "Hitler a \"Christian\"? LOL!\n \n What part of \"Love your neighbor\" and \"Love your enemies\" did he forget?\n \n Nazi Paganism\n \n The Nazis defended paganism, both during the early stages, and also when they came to power in 1933. They tore German society away from Christianity, and tried to turn it to pagan beliefs. \n \n A short while after Hitler came to power, Christian holidays and festivals were replaced by pagan ones. 'Mother Earth' or 'Father Sky' were called on at wedding ceremonies. In 1935, Christian prayers in schools were stopped, and then all lessons concerning Christianity were banned. \n \n Schoolchildren were taught the so-called 'Glorious pre-Christian German history,' and various rites and ceremonies, legacies of pagan culture, were held all over Germany. All Nazi meetings were in the form of traditional pagan ceremonies. There was almost no difference between Nazi rallies, held under the shadow of flaming torches, where slogans full of hate and violence were shouted and Wagner's pagan music played, and the perverted ceremonies carried out thousands of years ago at pagan temples and altars. \n \n The Nazis also used the arts to re-awaken paganism. Ancient Greek concepts and symbols began to predominate under Nazi rule, and many statues similar to Greek statues were made, showing strong men and women of the Aryan race. Hitler dreamed that a 'superior race' would be formed by the use of eugenics, and establish a cruel and oppressive 'world kingdom' based on the Spartan model. The expression \n \n 'The Third Reich' is a statement of this dream. And as a result of this dream, 55 million people lost their lives in the Second World War, the bloodiest conflict that had ever been seen. \n \n http://www.islamdenouncesantisemitism.com/thepagan.htm",

Why are you obsessed with getting me to say it is something else???\n\n \n Because you cannot trust 'your instincts' because they may be being manipulated but you discount this possibility completely - why?\n \n \"Because the Holy Spirit wouldn't allow it!\" Well if the Holy Spirit was a emotion sucking inter dimensional entity as before stated it would lie to you and say its protecting you - anything to make you feel happy.\n \n \nLike I said before I consider you to be the demon, by trying to get me to deny Christ, which isn't going to happen in this lifetime.\n\n \n While the concept of me being an immortal, demonic entity causing havok here on Earth after being given the 'go ahead' by God sounds pretty cool I'm afraid I'm not.\n \n I'm not in anyway trying to get you to 'deny christ' I'm just trying to get to the bottom of 'why' you believe. Lets be honest if you can answer my questions I might end up being converted! You just aren't answering my questions with anything other than \"because\" which means nothing.\n \n \n\n The Holy Spirit wouldn't allow me to be decieved.\n\n \n Why on Earth do you trust this entity that you call the Holy Spirit?\n \n Don't you realise any evil entity would pretend to be something exactly like the Holy Spirit? It would try to have you trust and love it as much as possible!\n \n When I challenge you on this point you just say something to the extent of \"It's not evil because it say's it's not!\" well of course it says it's not! It wouldn't would it?!\n \n \n If you can't accept my answers then that's your problem not mine.\n\n \n If you can't give rational answers to my questions without using circular logic admit it now and we'll be done - I want to give you a chance to vindicate your beliefs because I'm open to your beliefs hence my questions.\n \n \nWhy are you trying to contort God and make him out to be some demon or something??? What just are you trying to prove???\n\n \n First of all 'God' as you see him does not exist for me as a 'given' so while you believe we're talking about an existing entity I'm talking about something I haven't seen any evidence for so rationally decide it's likely not to exist.\n \n The purpose of my points relating to your 'presence' being an evil entity is to show that you have no quantative basis for your belief and in fact my suggestion of it being an evil emotion sucking entity has just as much credence as your belief that it's your 'God'.\n \n Hopefully through this suggestions I'm hoping you can provide some rational answer that sets your belief in your 'God' above the liklihood its an evil emotion sucking entity. Unfortunatley so far you have failed to provide this rational answer and indeed only exhibited circular logic.\n \n \nYou wouldn't because you don't have the faith.\n\n \n faith n. Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence.\n \n Do you agree with this deffinition? By saying I don't have the faith that implies to me that you consider you do and as such implies you act without any logical proof or material evidece.\n \n \nI may be wrong but from the statement above it sounds like your saying something is wrong with my reality and my beliefs.\n\n \n I haven't critiscised your version of Christianity I have critiscised how you've come to believe in it.\n \n You believe in something illogicaly with no proof but when I present another equally as valid possibility (evil emotion sucking entity) for what you claim you've been experiencing you suddenly say 'no' despite having no logical basis to say 'no'.\n \n \nWell, that's just to bad.\n\n \n How Christian of you...\n \n \nIs that when you started having all of this seeming animosity???\n\n \n The only animosity that has devloped is because you wont answer my questions with anything other than circular logic.\n \n If I hated you and Christianity I wouldn't be giving you the benefit of the doubt and asking you why you believe as you do and why the evil emotion sucking entity isn't an equal possibility. If I felt animosity towards you I'd simply conclude you're just another religious nutter and be on my way but I don't I want to give you a 'fair hearing'.\n \n \nJust because God punishes those who live ungodly lives, doesn't mean he doesn't love them.\n\n \n That would be a fair comment if God didn't know before creating them that they wouldn't find there way back to him but he does know and does it anyway!\n \n \nThey still have choice.\n\n \n They don't though do they? God knew before he made them that they wouldn't find there way back to Him - are you suggesting God isn't all powerful and all knowing? The Bible suggests he is is both loving and all knowing.\n \n Your God contradicts what the Bible says about him - loving Vs all knowing.\n \n \nI'd like to see you prove God doesn't exist.\n\n \n If something doesn't exist how on Earth can you collect evidence that it doesn't?\n \n You cannot prove a negative.",

It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows.

   "HeavenBound BigOrn - you haven't responded to my post although it's not like you have to I'm just posting in case you overlooked it by accident. :)\n\n Not ignoring you, Wraith. Work sometimes eats into my play time... :)\n \nWhy does it have to be either or?\n\n In my game...it would. I tire easily at this, Wraith. I ain't playing no more...\n ...no offense.\n \nWell this quote - God will establish us and protect us from evil (2 Thessalonians 3:3, 1 John 5:18)\n \n Either God does protect Christians from evil or he doesn't surely? emoticon_confused\n\n How does evil apply here? Will evil destroy just my body or my body and soul?\n \n The Bible teaches us (Christians and \"whosoever will\") that it is our spiritual life that needs the most protection. Because of evil we can be tricked into believing a lie, preventing us from knowing Christ and losing our salvation. God will and does establish us just as He (Christ) established the scriptures. He takes us from one level, spiritually, to the next so that our flesh then can be established through our faith. It's not that we can shed this skin, but we can withstand the natural with the spiritual - through Christ, the Holy Spirit. Since that's the case and knowing that we have to suffer this, He protects our spirit with His own.\n \n There is a purpose to life other than satisfying the flesh and that is what that scripture is referring to.\n \nI'm sorry I suggested this as a way to make the above quote 'correct' while still allowing 'evil' to happen to Christians - God protects Christians from the evil acts of demons and fallen Angels but not other humans?\n\n Not necessarily. I believe that good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people. I believe that there is a \"hell on earth\" and that many people live in it daily - all day, every day. It would be foolish of me to think that God would remove all the bad things in this life. But (you probably knew there was a \"but\", huh?) in all things to those who love Christ there is a way out of the crisis. With His Spirit we can endure all things for not only does the testing of our faith produce patience, but it thrusts us forward as an engine. So, evil, in its attempt to conquer us has made us stronger.\n \n I would also like to point out that \"demons and fallen angels\" work according to a plan initiated by one single power: the powers of darkness. These \"demons and fallen angels\" are no more than the principle of their being and can do nothing contrary to that principle. So, in reality, it is the principality that is a greater danger than the \"demons and fallen angels\".\n \nNot if he doesn't want too - it's not like we can force Him is it?\n \n Are you suggesting it's some how God's plan for those said people's land to suffer drought?\n \n Evil happens in the world and we ask God's help and at the end of the prayer we say \"if it is your will Lord\" but he chooses not to help? Is this where faith comes into play and a Christians says to himself \"well God is allowing this suffering and evil for a reason\"?\n\n God's plan is salvation. The earth suffers due to evil and must go through the natural course of things just like we do. It's hard to imagine that the earth itself is a living entity and must suffer, but that's the big picture we're looking at. \n \n And God's will has been misunderstood for so long, due to religion I might add, that it seems nothing can be done about anything. All through the Bible it teaches of God's will for mankind and all through the Bible is shows mankind's constant ignorance of it. It appears that all mankind can see is an old gray man sitting on a throne with a lightning bolt in one hand and a coachwhip in the other beating man into submission. I would encourage you and everyone to look at it again and see that mankind has beaten itself up.\n \nPraying for aid to those who suffer of which for example the Pope does is something we ought not do and hence God does not do it?\n\n Maybe I should have written: \"We don't actually know how to pray.\"\n \nDidn't Jesus pray to the Father and feed a few thousand people from one basket?\n\n Those that left all they had just to hear His teachings? Yes. And He still does.\n \n I can say He feeds me daily. It is now the time to understand that this world is natural and that we are natural, but if we break away from it, leave that \"life\" behind and go hear Him teach, He'll still feed the thousands with just one fish.\n \nSo it's humanity's fault natural disasters occur?\n\n No. It's the natural occurrences of the earth and \"what makes the world go 'round\", as I have stated earlier...despite what religions teach.\n \nCan you explain to me exactly why God considers it's my fault that (a) Lucifer rebelled (b) Adam and Eve were tricked by Lucifer?\n\n It's not your fault or mine, it's just the way things are since God is the way He is and we are the way He made us. Mankind would be an animal were it not for God's love, scrounging around for food and living in holes in the ground. God created us special and we have specific requirements: Believe on Him, believe in Him and believe what He says. He is the Way, the Truth and the Life.\n Why must we suffer because of what someone else did? Because of what happened before this earth-age we are required to live in these fleshly bodies, are required to endure the lifespan or generation that was borne of that condition. It's not that as individuals we have done something to upset God, it's just that mankind is a process of life that can either send us to eternal life or send us to eternal death.\n \nFair point, if God does exist I feel pretty resentful towards him that he blames me for things I had no control over (see last comment), and that he allows bad things to happen. Now God would claim he loves me so much he sacrificed his son for me but I'd counter that why is it my fault that he had to do that? God would I presume say I'm a sinner. I'd respond that if God hadn't created Lucifer he wouldnt have tempted Adam and Eve and they wouldn't have been cast out of Eden. If I was then created at a later date I would have been incapable of sin and living in paradise - win, win.\n\n That's true, all of it. But, if He would have not created Lucifer the way He created us - with freedom to chose at will then the human race would be nothing more than a bunch of smiling robots.\n When you, Wraith, make a mistake, make the wrong choice, or take the wrong road, do you blame God, or your parents, or any of your loved ones? It's not God's fault that we make the wrong decisions, it is God's fault, however, for giving us the freedom to be what we want to be and do what we choose. For that, we should be thankful.\n \nIt says we will suffer evil but it also says God protects us from evil?\n \n God will establish us and protect us from evil (2 Thessalonians 3:3, 1 John 5:18)\n \n Can you see why this is confusing to me?\n\n Evil infects the spirit and soul with such devastation that the body ultimately pays for it. That's the protection from evil we need.\n \nMy thanks to you and HeavenBound for persisting with my questions - it's not like you are bound to answer any of them ( unless you consider it spreading God's truth or something? emoticon_confused ).\n\n I am bound to answer them; it's my job - unless I'm only a Christian by name. :)",

It's not that as individuals we have done something to upset God, it's just that mankind is a process of life that can either send us to eternal life or send us to eternal death.\n\n \n So God's just blaming me for things I didn't do because that's just what God does?\n \n Oh he sounds a great God to worship, really fits the God of Love the New Testament describes.\n \n Why do you feel Man is set apart from the animal kingdom? Personally I see humans as animals - I'm interested to hear (read) what makes humans better than animals. On the other hand if your reasoning is because man had a 'soul' or 'free will' gifted to him by your God we'll just agree to disagree.\n \n Also what's wrong with living as a hunter gatherer? What's wrong with living a nomadic life stlyle surrounded by nature?\n \n \n\n \nFair point, if God does exist I feel pretty resentful towards him that he blames me for things I had no control over (see last comment), and that he allows bad things to happen. Now God would claim he loves me so much he sacrificed his son for me but I'd counter that why is it my fault that he had to do that? God would I presume say I'm a sinner. I'd respond that if God hadn't created Lucifer he wouldnt have tempted Adam and Eve and they wouldn't have been cast out of Eden. If I was then created at a later date I would have been incapable of sin and living in paradise - win, win.\n\n \n That's true, all of it. But, if He would have not created Lucifer the way He created us - with freedom to chose at will then the human race would be nothing more than a bunch of smiling robots.\n \n\n \n I'll just post here what I said to HeavenBound -\n \n Yes only God can answer why He on purpose creates people when he already knows before creating them that they will suffer and not find their way to him!\n \n He knows yet this 'loving' God does it anyway!\n \n This 'loving' God then judges these people even though he knew before creating them that they would not find their way back to him!\n \n This God contradicts the loving nature the Bible describes doesn't He?\n \n So either the Bible is wrong about God being all knowing or it is wrong about this God being a 'loving God'.\n \n Or of course He might not in fact exist at all making the Bible wrong and God non existant...\n \n \n\n When you, Wraith, make a mistake, make the wrong choice, or take the wrong road, do you blame God, or your parents, or any of your loved ones? It's not God's fault that we make the wrong decisions, it is God's fault, however, for giving us the freedom to be what we want to be and do what we choose. For that, we should be thankful.\n\n \n I don't believe in 'free will' - people and as such the choices they make are the sum of their genes and environment - I haven't seen any evidence to the contrary.",

   "First: There were many who listened to Hitler's religious rhetoric including the jews. Many of them turned in other jews in the name of judaism. Islam, Christianity, atheism, nationalism etc. In fact, it was nationalism that was the highest ideal (where do you think the word NAZI comes from?).\n \n Second, the jews have been persecuted for much much longer than christianity has existed. And by many more factions. The rhetoric would have been available even if christianity had never existed. \n \n Lastly, just because hitler used it and other christians used it does not mean that the holocaust was the fault of christianity which was your original claim. The holocaust was developed by Hitler. It was implemented by those loyal to him for a multitude of reasons. The christian religion is one, by and large, of love. This much is in evidence. You base your conjecture on straw man arguments and are ever increasing in wild claims at this point.\n\n \n Actually, I was responding to the claim the Hitler was not a CHristian. I was not blaming Christianity.. but I was pointing out that Hitler was a CHristian. He might not have been a very good one, but the religion he gave lip service to was Christianity. \n \n As for Christianty being one of love, well, that seems to be a modern fluffy bunny interpretation. The Crusades, the autodefe, and the pogroms are stark \n evidence that Christianity is not 'love'. The web sites of the Christian Idenity groups, the KKK (which claims to be a 'christian' organisation', Fred Phillips and other show that Christiainty doesn't automatically mean a 'religion of love'. Now, if you point to the Quakers, you are getting closer. \n \n When I look at the Christian rhetoric from Easyrider, I do not see love. When I look at some of the pronouncements of the SBC, I do not see love. When I see many of the televangilsts, I see greed preying on praying.. not christian love. \n \n I do know a number of people that demonstrate the current modern ideal of CHristian love. Many even are Christians. In general, it tends not to be the institutions of Christianity, but rather individuals.",

See above.\n \nThis God contradicts the loving nature the Bible describes doesn't He?\n\n I don't see it. Really. I blame alot on religion - I admit that. But many times it just human nature to get the wrong ideas.\n \nSo either the Bible is wrong about God being all knowing or it is wrong about this God being a 'loving God'.\n\n I think the Bible tells it just like it is.

   "How do you know your faith is based on the truth?\n\n \n Because I believe in God and God is truth.\n \n \n \nBecause you cannot trust 'your instincts' because they may be being manipulated but you discount this possibility completely - why?\n \n \"Because the Holy Spirit wouldn't allow it!\" Well if the Holy Spirit was a emotion sucking inter dimensional entity as before stated it would lie to you and say its protecting you - anything to make you feel happy.\n\n \n So, people cannot trust in anything, not their instincts or beliefs or anything. If that were so people wouldn't be able accomplish much, because they wouldn't be able to trust anyone else or anything they see or experience in the world. How do you know what you believe is true??? Oh, lordy I feel happy so it must be a emotion sucking entity, come on. \n \n \n \nWhile the concept of me being an immortal, demonic entity causing havok here on Earth after being given the 'go ahead' by God sounds pretty cool I'm afraid I'm not.\n\n \n How do you know??? It probably is some emotion sucking entity making you think that your not possessed, that's what they do you know. I can hardly wait for your answer.\n \n \n \nI'm not in anyway trying to get you to 'deny christ' I'm just trying to get to the bottom of 'why' you believe. Lets be honest if you can answer my questions I might end up being converted! You just aren't answering my questions with anything other than \"because\" which means nothing.\n\n \n I believe in God because he rescued me from a dark pit and turned my world around. I know it was God because I wouldn't have felt the love I did, no emotion sucking entity can make you feel love like that, I don't care what you say.\n \n \n \nWhy on Earth do you trust this entity that you call the Holy Spirit?\n\n \n I trust the Holy Spirit because it has seen me through many trials and tribulations. It's been the one thing I can always count on no matter what my circumstances. It often fills me with it's love to overflowing. It's certainly no emotion sucking entity, it's the giver of strength. I would deem to think most emotion sucking entities are terrified of it. \n \n \nDon't you realise any evil entity would pretend to be something exactly like the Holy Spirit? It would try to have you trust and love it as much as possible!\n\n \n Maybe some would try, but they can't imitate something that's so pure. They can't fake true love and something that's so beatiful, they would be hard pressed indeed.\n \n \n \n \nIf you can't give rational answers to my questions without using circular logic admit it now and we'll be done - I want to give you a chance to vindicate your beliefs because I'm open to your beliefs hence my questions.\n\n \n My answers are very rational to me and any other christian.\n \n \n \nFirst of all 'God' as you see him does not exist for me as a 'given' so while you believe we're talking about an existing entity I'm talking about something I haven't seen any evidence for so rationally decide it's likely not to exist.\n\n \n If you have to see to believe then you'll never get the answers you seek. God is about not seeing and believing anyway.\n \n \nThe purpose of my points relating to your 'presence' being an evil entity is to show that you have no quantative basis for your belief and in fact my suggestion of it being an evil emotion sucking entity has just as much credence as your belief that it's your 'God'.\n\n \n I have plenty of basis for my beliefs just because you say I don't or don't understand, doesn't mean anything. God has helped me and blessed me enough to last a lifetime.\n \n \n \n \nHopefully through this suggestions I'm hoping you can provide some rational answer that sets your belief in your 'God' above the liklihood its an evil emotion sucking entity. Unfortunatley so far you have failed to provide this rational answer and indeed only exhibited circular logic.\n\n \n Like I said earlier my answers are irrational only to you.\n \n \n \n \nfaith n. Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence.\n \n Do you agree with this deffinition? By saying I don't have the faith that implies to me that you consider you do and as such implies you act without any logical proof or material evidece.\n\n \n You forgot a part of the definition:\n \n \"Confident belief in the truth, value, or trustworthiness of a person, idea, or thing\"\n \n I rather like this definition better\n \n \n \n \nI haven't critiscised your version of Christianity I have critiscised how you've come to believe in it.\n \n You believe in something illogicaly with no proof but when I present another equally as valid possibility (evil emotion sucking entity) for what you claim you've been experiencing you suddenly say 'no' despite having no logical basis to say 'no'.\n\n \n Just because you have no faith, don't knock me because I do. Like I said anyone can see and believe, it's the not seeing and believing that takes faith.\n Either you have it or you don't.\n \n \n \n \nHow Christian of you...\n\n \n What were you looking for some more poor you's??? This is something you need to figure out yourself, I gave you all the input I had. \n \n \n \n \nThat would be a fair comment if God didn't know before creating them that they wouldn't find there way back to him but he does know and does it anyway!\n \n \n They don't though do they? God knew before he made them that they wouldn't find there way back to Him - are you suggesting God isn't all powerful and all knowing? The Bible suggests he is is both loving and all knowing.\n \n Your God contradicts what the Bible says about him - loving Vs all knowing.\n\n \n Of course God is all powerful and all knowing. Would it have been less loving to not create them at all and never give them a chance???\n \n \n \n \nIf something doesn't exist how on Earth can you collect evidence that it doesn't?\n \n You cannot prove a negative.\n\n \n Well, there are a lot of people who say he exist. Just because you say he doesn't, doesn't make it so. I think that's a cop out.",

I would deem to think most emotion sucking entities are terrified of it.\n\n \n Again you seem to claim knowledge of inter-dimensional emotion sucking entities - where do you find this insite into the inner motivations, and xenobiology of said entity?\n \n Is it not possible the said entity is symbiotic in nature and 'feeds' you said 'strength' (how much can you bench press BTW with this guy helping you) in exchange for the nourishment it gains from you? It certainly logically wouldn't want you to die because then it would have to hunt for new prey and expend energy doing so.\n \n \nMaybe some would try, but they can't imitate something that's so pure. They can't fake true love and something that's so beatiful, they would be hard pressed indeed.\n\n \n Once more you are claiming knowledge of inter-dimensional emotion sucking entities. What knowledge do you have to suggest what these entities would be 'hard pressed' to do?\n \n \nMy answers are very rational to me and any other christian.\n\n \n ra\u00b7tion\u00b7al adj.\n \n 1. Having or exercising the ability to reason.\n 2. Of sound mind; sane.\n 3. Consistent with or based on reason; logical: rational behavior. See Synonyms at logical.\n 4. Mathematics.

God is about not seeing and believing anyway.\n\n \n What answers am I seeking?\n \n I have to have evidence to believe - I can't see radio waves but overwhelming evidence for their existance exists so I can rationally conclude its likely they exist.\n \n \nI have plenty of basis for my beliefs just because you say I don't or don't understand, doesn't mean anything. \n\n \n Please present said quantative basis for your belief.\n \n \nLike I said earlier my answers are irrational only to you.\n\n \n Nope they are just irrational - they have no basis in logic UNLESS you're holding back on me with some prime piece of evidence that proves rationally your God exists.\n \n \n\n You forgot a part of the definition:\n \n \"Confident belief in the truth, value, or trustworthiness of a person, idea, or thing\"\n \n I rather like this definition better\n\n \n You haven't proved God exists so he cannot be a person, idea, or thing hence why that deffinition doesnt apply.\n \n He could be an idea though but I don't think your suggesting you have faith in an 'idea' which you've named 'God' rather you have faith in a 'god' which you've named 'God'.\n \n \nJust because you have no faith, don't knock me because I do.\n\n \n Like I said originally I'm not critiscising your faith I'm critiscising how you've come to have that faith.\n \n \nWhat were you looking for some more poor you's???

You have some background knowledge on demonic entities???\n\n \n Well I do have background knowledge as described in your faith system as presented in your Bible (and The Apocrypha).\n \n First of all demons were born of female human and Angelic parents and were terrible violent Giants reffered to in the Bible as the Nephilim. The Nephilim were really evil guys went around eating people and then eventually eating themselves. Around this time God decided he didn't like the Nephilim so he sent the big flood to kill them (and the rest of the humans he didnt like). The Nephilim's bodies were killed but because the Nephilim had Angelic parents they had both spiritual and physical natures so there spirits persisted remaining on Earth. These spirits became known as demons and God actually allowed a group of them to continue causing mischief on Earth after he had his Angelic servants throw the rest in the Abyss to be chanied up along side a number of Fallen Angels that had got out of hand on Earth.\n \n So I know if I'm a demon I'm being deluded as I can't remeber anything in the past short of my 22 years of living as this human with this human family.\n \n Now if I was a demon I'd remember back for millenia and be able to do all sorts of cool things like astral project in spirit form, and possess people etc but I don't seem to be able to do these things.\n \n If the proposition that I am deluded is to be correct something or someone must have wiped my memory, replaced those lost memories with the ones I have now, and had me possess this poor human I now reside in.\n \n \nNone\n\n \n Exactly so you can't logically say a emotion sucking entity could not pretend to be what you feel is the holy spirit - you can suggest the possibility but you can't logically say for sure.\n \n \nI accept your apologies.\n\n \n ;)\n \n \nNo entity could possibly imitate the Holy Spirit and do it justice, a pure heart would know instantly and a pure heart don't lie.\n\n \n But how can you limit something's power like that with no knowledge of it?\n \n You've already admitted you have no background knowledge on said entities so how do you possibly know?\n \n This 'pure heart' concept (which is meaningless) may well just be the influence of the emotion sucking entity playing through - certainly its a logical possibility that he'll be fighting my probing of you because if you realise the truth of possibilities he might loose you and have to find new prey.\n \n \n\n No one can be a christian and host an evil entity.\n\n \n First of all 'being christian' may well be meaningless secondly emotion sucking entities are not evil.\n \n Do you call leeches evil? There just animals who'll suck your blood if you wade into the river in the same way an emotion sucking entity is just doing what it's evolved to do.\n \n \nThese entities could not give or show love like the Holy Spirit can.\n\n \n Stop limiting their power when you have no knowledge to do so after all your experience of 'the Holy Spirit' might be entirely because of said emotion sucking entity - you might not have ever been in contact with the Holy Spirit as it's always been this emotion sucking entity!\n \n \nIt seems you have an inner knowledge of these entities, please tell how you came to know so much about them???\n\n \n Nope, theres no evidence they even exist (just like your holy spirit) I've just been suggesting possibilities and using word like 'might' and 'its possible' - re read what I've typed and you'll see.\n \n All we know is you claim to be 'feeling' some entity in your life who claims to be the Holy spirit and you've proposed it is the Holy Spirit from the Bible and I have proposed its a inter dimensional emotion sucking entity.\n \n The difference is you irrationally and illogically claim my proposition is wrong even though it's as equally valid as your own proposition.\n \n \nI just wonder who gets to say what's reasonable and logical??? Just because you think something is illogical doesn't make it so.\n\n \n Err... I think you better research what logic actually is - logic is set it is 2+2=4 it is not relative or subjective.\n \n \nLike is there a God. You'll never find him because he lives in a spiritual plane, where you have to have faith to know him.\n\n \n I already know there's a God but I know there's a God because I choose to define 'God' a particular way which logically makes this 'God's' existance garunteed.\n \n But this is for another thread we're focussing on you at the moment - let us not get side tracked! Press on good sir! ;)\n \n \n If you're asking for physical evidence I don't have any. All my evidence is of a spiritual nature and if you can't except that, then that's your loss.\n\n \n So in fact you don't have said quantitive evidence and I was right all along to say what I did in my original statement.\n \n \nSays who, you??? \n\n \n Nope logic.\n \n \n\n Show me where it says they have to be proven to exist and by who's standard's??????????\n\n \n The deffinition you said you liked better -\n \n \nYou forgot a part of the definition:\n \n \"Confident belief in the truth, value, or trustworthiness of a person, idea, or thing\"\n \n I rather like this definition better\n\n \n Now the three identifiers here are person, idea, or thing.\n \n Now something that doesn't or hasn't ever existed cannot be a person or a thing - you've already stated you have no quantative evidence to prove God does exist so I win the argument by default.\n \n There is the possibility as I presented before that your consider God an 'idea' which I've assumed you don't but if you're telling me you do consider your God just an idea you win the argument.\n \n \nGod's a big boy he can name himself.\n\n \n So you claim God actually uses the word 'God' to refer to himself rather than the Aramaic word for 'God' \"Alah\" which Jesus Himself used?\n \n Is not the word 'God' just the English translation of the Aramaic noun?\n \n \nChristian's are not perfect. There was nothing bad in what I said, only in how you percieved It.\n\n \n Christians aren't perfect? ;)\n \n There was something bad in what you said, only how you percieved it led you to believe other wise.\n \n \nPraytell, how should a christian act, since your such an authority?\n\n \n As close to how Jesus acted as possible - they should emulate Him in word and action?\n \n I'm not officially a Biblical scholar though so...\n \n \nDid you not state \"If something doesn't exist how on Earth can you collect evidence that it doesn't?\" It appears you're contradicting yourself.

   "In this statement you've limited God's knowledge so you're saying God isn't all knowing contradicting what the Bible has to say about the subject.\n\n No, you misunderstand God's knowledge. If God saw a certain thing before it actually happened it would be happening, actually. That's the misconception most people have of God. They think that the Bible says one thing (you're not alone in this, I can assure you) and yet never take time to fully read and understand the scriptures. We, as human beings tend to see things in the natural and place supernatural traits to anything outside that realm. In the process we use information that we accumulate on the natural level. This is normal and there's no need to beat oneself up over it.\n \n There is a different meaning to God's ability to know events before they happen as it pertains to the future and it is called \"His Plan\". Planning certain things so that they happen as He sees fit is not the same as seeing a bird fall before it falls.\n \nI'm not critiscising you for this I'm just looking for it to be clear - your God isn't all knowing, your God contradicts the Bible.\n\n I know you're not. I can see where certain beliefs and preconceived ideas can lead us to conclusions contrary to scripture. I'm not immune to that by any means. What I believe I base on scripture and how they align with each other in order to explain them. That's the only avenue I have other than trying to explain my knowledge via the Holy Spirit, which most times is like trying to make you believe what I believe. That's not a good idea and I think you'll agree.\n For example Deuteronomy 4:25 speaks of doing certain things that will provoke God to anger. If God knew that you were going to do something before you did it, why would He get angry? Giving us the freedom to do things is how God intended it to be. He wants us to show our true character without Him plotting our every move.\n \nHe either is omniscient or He isn't - you either know everything or you don't.\n\n Where did I say that He was not omniscient? His infinite awareness has never been in question in my posts.\n What exactly are you referring to?\n \nErr...?\n \n Is this another \"because *the* 'spirit voice' tells me it's true?\" If it is I'll direct you to my discussion with HeavenBound.\n\n Okay.\n \nCan you explain this passage? Or at least can you give your interpretation of this passage?\n What if God wanting to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory, even us whom He called, not of the Jews only but also the Gentiles?\n\n I can give you another translation if that will help:\n It may be that God wants to show His power and His anger against sin. He waits a long time on some men who are ready to be destroyed. God also wanted to show His immaculate greatness to those He has given His loving. He made them ready for His immaculate greatness from the beginning. We are the ones He chose. He did not only choose Jews. He also chose some from among the people who are not Jews.\n To better understand this we've got to understand that Paul responds to the objection that if God rules over faith through the principle of divine election, God cannot then accuse unbelievers of sin. As far as he was concerned, this objection is in the last analysis a manifestation of human insolence, and his \"answer\" is less an explanation of God's ways than the rejection of an argument that places humanity on a level with God. At the same time, Paul shows that God is far less random than appearances suggest, which is developed (as I have stated earlier) by our natural means of gathering data, for God endures with much patience - which is stated as \"longsuffering\" above.\n In other words when you read the above scripture you automatically revert to human emotions and decide that God isn't fair in His judgments. It's normal to think that way...who can blame you? But, that's the religionists' view of God's main purpose or plan of salvation, not the true plan according to scripture. \n Look at the scripture again and see where it refers to \"the vessels of wrath\". God creates nothing for destruction whatsoever. Once we understand that we see that \"the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction\" actually had to consume or feed on evil in order to place themselves in that position. \n They actually prepared themselves for destruction by doing so. Can you see the pattern?\n \nIf God knows all he knowingly condemns men who he made to be the way they are and knew that they would never find Him - this is not a loving act. If God doesn't know the futures of the men he creates then he is of course not 'all knowing'.\n\n This is another misunderstanding of scripture. Before the foundation of this world certain acts were committed, which had certain repercussions. In order for God to bring about justice to those that committed the sins He had to initiate a plan of salvation that included them. According to scripture there were some who were so vicious and cruel that even this \"second chance\" would not change them. It is these that God foreknew to be scoundrels...like Judas. He foreknew Judas would betray Him. Scripture confirms this, not me. And furthermore, God did not create Judas to become so infected with evil; it was the spirit of Judas, the way he really was, that sealed his outcome. You see? It was his own undoing, not God's. \n \nExcept for the entire spiritual death deal...\n\n There are no exceptions, Wraith. Either you believe or you don't. \n \n That's about all I can say in reply to that.",

Don't say emotion sucking entities could have wrote it either, just answer the question plain and simple. \n \n \n \n \nThat's right your instincts provide motivation so I reccomend questioning your motivations by applying logic and objective reason to them.\n\n \n You said we can't trust our instincts, but that they provide motivation so we should question our motivation. That makes absolutely no sense at all. If we can't trust our instincts, I would think our motivation would be screwy also so what would be the point in questioning them?????????????

Then when I use the bible to explain something, it just can't be. Some double standard you have going there.\n \n How do you know what a demon would remember?????? How do you know what a demon is capable of??????\n \n \n \n \nBut how can you limit something's power like that with no knowledge of it?\n \n You've already admitted you have no background knowledge on said entities so how do you possibly know?\n \n This 'pure heart' concept (which is meaningless) may well just be the influence of the emotion sucking entity playing through - certainly its a logical possibility that he'll be fighting my probing of you because if you realise the truth of possibilities he might loose you and have to find new prey.\n\n \n I can because I know the power of the Holy Spirit through the bible. Prove the pure heart comes from this emotion sucking entity?????? Just answer the question please!!!\n \n \n \n \nFirst of all 'being christian' may well be meaningless secondly emotion sucking entities are not evil.\n\n \n Praytell, how being a christian may be meaningless?????? Emotion sucking entities would be considered evil, their supposedly sucking someone's emotion away. If I had a emotion sucking entity I would be devoid of emotion after all these years. Apparently all they do is take, and never give. \n \n \n \n \n \nStop limiting their power when you have no knowledge to do so after all your experience of 'the Holy Spirit' might be entirely because of said emotion sucking entity - you might not have ever been in contact with the Holy Spirit as it's always been this emotion sucking entity!\n\n \n If I had a emotion sucking enitity would I not be devoid of emotion. If it's sucking emotion away, how can it be acting like the Holy Spirit at the same time??????? Why do I still feel emotions??????????????? \n \n \n \n \nNope, theres no evidence they even exist (just like your holy spirit) I've just been suggesting possibilities and using word like 'might' and 'its possible' - re read what I've typed and you'll see.\n\n \n There is evidence inside every christian that walks the earth, there is indeed a Holy Spirit.

   "No, you misunderstand God's knowledge.\n\n \n He either knows everything or he doesn't...\n \n \nThere is a different meaning to God's ability to know events before they happen as it pertains to the future and it is called \"His Plan\". Planning certain things so that they happen as He sees fit is not the same as seeing a bird fall before it falls.\n\n \n Again He either knows everything or he doesn't.\n \n All I see you saying here is your God cant see into the future of the men he creates which is fine it's just that means He's not omniscient.\n \n \nFor example Deuteronomy 4:25 speaks of doing certain things that will provoke God to anger. If God knew that you were going to do something before you did it, why would He get angry? Giving us the freedom to do things is how God intended it to be. He wants us to show our true character without Him plotting our every move.\n\n \n While I genuinely respect your attempt to make comments regarding information other than that gleaned from your Holy Spirit am I to understand you are asking me to consider something because the Bible wouldn't make sense otherwise? As in your suggesting the Bible has to make sense?\n \n Ok, remaining open minded though, and simply because it's interesting perhaps God descides he will not act upon a action of a human before they actually complete something that will make Him angry because otherwise he might act before said human acts and in doing so confuse the human transgressor as to what he has done 'wrong'?\n \n \n\n Where did I say that He was not omniscient? His infinite awareness has never been in question in my posts.\n What exactly are you referring to?\n\n \n omniscient \n \n adj.\n \n Having total knowledge; knowing everything: an omniscient deity; the omniscient narrator.\n \n n.\n \n 1. One having total knowledge.\n 2. Omniscient God. Used with the.\n \n Now, how can your God be omniscient if there are some things he does not know?\n \n \nI can give you another translation if that will help:\n \n ...\n\n \n Ok so first point I see here is you are saying the scripture is saying \"how dare humans criticise God's plan just because it to them seems unfair\".\n \n 'Wow' is all I have to say to this - \"you puny mortals I shall damn you even though it's my fault and you dare to point out it's My fault!\"\n \n Basically don't use your brain you can't possibly comprehend my 'divine justice' - wow, just wow.\n \n \nGod creates nothing for destruction whatsoever.\n\n \n Logically as I've presented in my posts I don't see how he doesn't but continue -\n \n \nOnce we understand that we see that \"the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction\" actually had to consume or feed on evil in order to place themselves in that position.\n They actually prepared themselves for destruction by doing so. Can you see the pattern?\n\n \n If your God is not omniscient I can see how this all works out yes.\n \n Your God as you present isn't omniscient, doesn't know certain things like the futures of the men he creates hence when said men are created by God he doesn't know they will fail.\n \n \nThis is another misunderstanding of scripture. Before the foundation of this world certain acts were committed, which had certain repercussions. In order for God to bring about justice to those that committed the sins He had to initiate a plan of salvation that included them. According to scripture there were some who were so vicious and cruel that even this \"second chance\" would not change them. It is these that God foreknew to be scoundrels...like Judas. He foreknew Judas would betray Him. Scripture confirms this, not me. And furthermore, God did not create Judas to become so infected with evil; it was the spirit of Judas, the way he really was, that sealed his outcome. You see? It was his own undoing, not God's.\n\n \n Again this makes sense if your God as you present isn't omniscient, doesn't know certain things like the futures of the men he creates and as such when said men are created by God he doesn't know they will fail.",

   "I have the bible which is physically real\n\n \n The book is but the knowledge it imparts? This remains to be proven.\n \n \njust because you don't accept who inspired it doesn't mean it's fake.\n\n \n I've never claimed it is fake - I've just asked how you know what it says is true?\n \n \nCan you prove without a doubt that the bible was not inspired by God????????????????\n\n \n First of all why must you insist on using repeated punctuation in your posts? One question mark will suffice.\n \n You can't prove a negative I've already stated this.\n \n \n \n Now then seen as you've again avoided discussing my specific comments can I please refer you back to the section of my last post to you regarding your circular logic - can you comprehend the flawed circular logic you are using?\n \n \n \nYou said we can't trust our instincts, but that they provide motivation so we should question our motivation. That makes absolutely no sense at all.\n\n \n Not all motivation comes from instincts obviously e.g. environment.\n \n \nYou didn't really answer all these questions from my last post.\n\n \n The clarification above may help.\n \n \nTalk about illogical. I think you watched the matrix one too many times!\n\n \n Why is it illogical to recognise this possibility?\n \n \n\n What contradictions with God and the Bible?????????? Please list all of them\n that prove I'm illogical.\n\n \n Re-read all my posts and you will have them their to repond too -\n \n Circular reasoning last post, contradictions - God is both Loving and Omniscient etc etc...\n \n \nYou think you're clever answering a question with a question. I call it avoidance. I thought you with all your proof would jump right on that one.\n\n \n I would have thought you'd understand the point - both examples are equally absurd yet you irrationally favour one over the other. By taking your question and altering it to include the emotion sucking entity I seeked to subtly present to you how both explanation are equally valid.\n \n \nSo you use the Bible and Apocrypha when it is convenient for you and it's O.k.. Then when I use the bible to explain something, it just can't be. Some double standard you have going there.\n\n \n I'm speaking to someone who believes the Bible is the truth so I research said person's Holy book to respond to his comments and I am condemned for it?\n \n \n\n How do you know what a demon would remember?????? How do you know what a demon is capable of??????\n\n \n As I presented in my last post said demon is from your faith system's mythology as presented in the Bible and Apocrypha so using those I can gain insight into what demons are like. What's the problem?\n \n \nI can because I know the power of the Holy Spirit through the bible. Prove the pure heart comes from this emotion sucking entity?????? Just answer the question please!!!\n\n \n More circular logic?\n \n Anyway... prove it isn't coming from the said emotion sucking entity?\n \n I'm not here to disprove anything I'm here to ask you how you know it's the Holy Spirit and not an emotion sucking entity as presented in my many numerous posts?\n \n \nPraytell, how being a christian may be meaningless??????\n\n \n In the context of the passage your God may not exist hence 'may be meaningless'.\n \n \nEmotion sucking entities would be considered evil, their supposedly sucking someone's emotion away. If I had a emotion sucking entity I would be devoid of emotion after all these years. Apparently all they do is take, and never give.\n\n \n Considered by who? Do you consider the leech as I used in the example 'evil' - just an animal doing what it takes to survive?\n \n I could proclaim ice cream 'evil' because it hurts my teeth but does that make it 'evil'?\n \n 'Evil' and 'Good' many propose don't infact exist they are moral constructs of society - what is evil in one country is acceptable in another and vica versa.\n \n \nIf I had a emotion sucking enitity would I not be devoid of emotion.\n\n \n Does a leech make you devoid of blood? No? It takes just enough and lets it's host continue. It would be bad business I propose for an emotion sucking entity to take any more emotion than the host would notice gone because then they would notice said entity and seek to get rid of it.\n \n \nIf it's sucking emotion away, how can it be acting like the Holy Spirit at the same time?\n\n \n See symbiotic relationship I proposed earlier.\n \n \nThere is evidence inside every christian that walks the earth, there is indeed a Holy Spirit.\n\n \n Can you take said evidence out of you and present it to me and others so they might see said evidence consider it objective and conclude it is worthy to be considered a pointer to your God's existance?\n \n \nJust because you can't see it or hold the evidence in the palm of your hand doesn't mean it's not there.\n\n \n Reffering back to my 'radio wave analogy' it is unnecessary to hold evidence in the 'palm of my hand'.\n \n \nThere is a difference we are promised the Holy Spirit will come upon us after we accept Jesus into our lives.\n\n \n The Bible Promises the Holy Spirit -< Why do you trust the Bible? -< It's God's word -< How do you know? -< The Bible says so -< How do you know the Bible is from God? -< The Bible Promises the Holy Spirit\n \n More circular logic...\n \n \nIf you already knew there was a God you wouldn't be questioning me.\n\n \n You see you say this because you consider your God the same as the one I propose I have logical evidence off but if you knew the deffinition you'd probably dissagree they were the same.\n \n \nIf your God isn't biblical then it isn't God.\n\n \n How so?\n \n \nI have the bible.\n\n \n So that's a 'no' then?\n \n \nAnd you have no quantative evidence to prove God doesn't exist.\n\n \n I'm not trying nor have I tried to prove your God doesn't exist nor could I considering you cannot prove a negative.\n \n \n One minute you say you know God exist, then the next you're saying he doesn't exist. What are you trying do, play both sides of the table??????????\n\n \n Hey! You said you prefered *that* deffinition and previously presented the one I chose.\n \n \nGod can use any word he wants to refer to himself, just like he's referred to by many names throughout the world. He only desires that people know who he is.\n\n \n You name your god 'God' that's all I was saying...\n \n \nYou were referring to God here when you made this comment:\n \n \"If something doesn't exist how on Earth can you collect evidence that it doesn't?\" \n\n \n Again I don't see the contradiction -\n \n I said -\n \n \nI don't say your God doesn't exist - I'm fully open to the possibility.\n \n I say to you who claims your God does exist where's the logical objective evidence he exists?\n\n \n I don't see the contradiction in fact my comments actually support what you've picked out!\n \n \n\"This is my final post as this tirade has gone on long enough.\"\n\n \n Now that's surprising, and dissapoitning - I spent all this time typing a response and now it wont be answerd. :(\n \n Oh well. ;)\n \n \n \n \n \nThat's part of the trouble with today's crop of intellectually deprived children. They watch so much fiction and surrealism, they think it's a fact of life. To them, life is not much more than just another video game.\n\n \n Reading your post either you are making a very clever concealed attack on HeavenBound or I have my first 'heckler' either way \"Yay me!\"",

I'm glad we've met in the middle here also.\n \nHey, lets not make this personal I have no problem with 'you' we're just discussing your God.\n\n That's what I was talking about. No, I can see no problem personally between us at all. I enjoy it, actually.\n \nBut yes at the moment we're talking about our trouble with the word omniscient, and whether your God granted free will.\n\n With the meaning of the word, perhaps. Whether God granted \"free will\" or, as I choose to say it, \"freedom of choice\"...maybe. But I think I'm the one with the \"free will\" problem mostly.\n \nOk points gleaned from this paragraph regarding your point of view -\n \n - Your God knows the future, past and present of only those actions, events, entities involved in his 'plan'.\n - 'People' wrongly assume certain actions, events, and entities are related to said 'divine' plan and hence confusion arises.\n - Omniscience was define differently when the Bible was written.\n \n Is this round about what you're saying?\n\n Yes, with the exception of point #3. It meant the same back then as it does today, IMHO.\n \nIf your God knows the minds of men why does he create certain men (and women) when he already knows that they wont choose to align themselves with Him?\n\n Are you referring to the remark I made about Judas? If that's it, then yes, he foreknew Judas's character, and then after getting to know Judas, he knew how he actually felt inside. Just because He knows the hearts of men doesn't mean He's a \"precog\".\n \nI haven't suggested that your God can control your mind although I have no evidence to say whether He might or not (never mind evidence to suggest He even exists).\n\n No, not directly, but implicitly by thinking that God uses His power to see, therefore manipulating, a person's next move, which I said would remove the power of \"free will\".\n I need you to understand that I believe that if God \"sees\" you commit murder, you will commit murder. Can you see where I'm coming from now?\n \nHa! No. I might have been baptised as a child but I didn't attend church or speak to any 'preachers' - my interest in religion and indeed the knowledge I now possess is down to my own research.\n \n I have great disdain for the negative aspects of organised religion.\n\n I'm with you on that.\n \nI know what you're trying to suggest here and I find it interesting - does omniscience mean you possess precognitive powers?\n \n Now if I knew everything (and I mean everything) it would be possible theoretically given 'godly' cognitive abilities to predict the future perfectly so while I technically wouldn't \"know\" the future I could predict it perfectly.\n\n I suppose so, but it still won't wash. There's a huge difference in knowing and predicting, and a big difference in the results if you factor in the manipulation component.\n \nAnother point is that God (your God, *the* God, whatever...) could exist out side of linear time and so be able to perceive both the past, present, and future giving him the ability to 'know' all events of 'all time'.\n\n That's true and I think He can. But, this will need to go back to the character of a living God that allows His creation to think for itself. Even though He can do all things, I don't believe He allows any measure of His promises to fall short. He has given us freedom of choice, His promise of it, and will not go back on His word.\n \nFurthermore there is the growing field of science regarding quanton physics which in turn is related to the subject of 'alternate dimensions'. Now this seems some what sci fi-ish but I invite you to research the topic for yourself.\n \n Anyway within this 'multi-verse' there exists (or so suggests quantom physicis) many different Universes each one representing a different variable - everything from universe differing from ours in relation to the weight of a 'particle' to universes differing from ours where John Smith's gate doesn't creek.

Where one millionth of a micro away from you and I are other universes? Where waving membranes that could have collided and \"could have\" caused the supposed Big Bang are still hovering?\n Yes, I am somewhat aware of it, but not enough to debate it.\n \nNow taking this back to your God you can see how he'd be able to 'know' the future.\n\n According to that theory not only for God to know, but perhaps you and I also.\n \nAll very interesting anyway... :)\n\n Yes.

Unfortunately by presenting the questions that trouble me in regards to the faith system being discussed it is often interpreted as as an attack.\n \n \nAnd thanks for the respect, which I hope I've shown you.\n\n \n You have indeed - thank you. :)",

   "Howdy,\n \n I must say this is a very entertaining if not long thread.\n I used to love jibing at my more \"zealous\" relatives with this very exercise:\n What if the Bible was written by Satan and you are really worshiping evil?\n \n I love it, there's really not much of any way around it.\n All you can say is \"cuz I just don't think so...\"\n \n I think the logicians in this thread are giving the christians a true run for their money.\n \n But I came across another little thing that I always had a problem with.\n \n \nI guess that's why he sacrificed his life for everyone.\n\n \n Ok, Jesus = God = Holy Spirit, right?\n \n God sent himself down to Earth in the form of a human, Jesus, who he also called his own son. Actually, he was kind of a demi-god, like Hercules, half-man half-god, but he's 100% god, though.\n \n Ok, despite all that BS, all-powerful God, in the form of a man, was beaten to a pulp and hung on a cross for a while until he died. Then, he didn't really die, because he was god and he could go back to heaven at any time, and he was there already anyway. Anyway, the big question is, \"Where's the sacrifice?\"\n \n What kind of sacrifice is it to not really give up anything?\n God gave up zero.\n \"But he gave his only begotten son!\"\n So Jesus is NOT god, but his half-human son?\n \n I mean, if we are to guilt trip people into believing that some martyr gave their life so that YOU little Billy can have everlasting life, then you'd hope that this person actually gave up something.\n \n God planned it all along to come down to earth, impregnate a human to give birth to himself, so that he could die but not die, and that's some kind of sacrifice?\n \n Give me a break!!!",
