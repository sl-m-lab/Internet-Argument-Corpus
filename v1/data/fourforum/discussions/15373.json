   "Answers.com - Approximately what percentage of recognized Scientists believes in Creation\nThe first thing is to decide what is meant be \"recognized scientists\" - eminent scientists, less eminent scientists who do perform pure research, or persons with advanced science degrees but perform little or no pure research. If reliable data on belief in creation within the scientific community is not available, we could start by establishing how many scientists believe in a personal god, because the number who literally believe in creation must be somewhat smaller than this.\n \n In 1998, a study by Larson and Witham appeared on the leading journal Nature (\"Leading scientists still reject God\"), showing that of the American scientists who had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, only about 7 percent believe in a personal god. Religious believers form about 40 percent of the less eminent scientists in America.\n \n A study in Britain, undertaken by R. Elisabeth Cornwell and Michael Stirrat, involved sending a questionnaire to all 1,074 Fellows of the Royal Society who possessed an email address, offering several propositions and asking the scientists to rank their beliefs on that point from 1 to 7. About 23 percent responded and preliminary results indicate that, of these, 3.3 percent agreed strongly (chose 7) and 78.8 percent disagreed strongly (chose 1) that a personal god exists. A total of 12 Fellows chose 6 or 7 to indicate that they were believers, while 213 Fellows chose 1 or 2 to indicate that they were nonbelievers.\n \n So, in the United States, 7 percent of eminent scientists believe in God, while 40 percent of less eminent scientists believe in God. In Britain, the survey indicated that just under 5 percent of eminent scientists believe in God. A lesser proportion would believe in creation; it is known that many of the general population who believe in God do not necessarily believe in a literalist version of the Creation story. In fact, Biblical-literalist creationism is considered a fringe belief.\n",

Both mention that Jesus was born of a virgin (as was the supposed prophesy) and that he was born in Bethleham. All the other details are completely different (including who the the angel told about the pregnancy... Joe in one, Mary in the other, why they went to Bethlehem... Herod and the baby killers in one, a census in the other, where they traveled afterwards, etc.) \n \n The common sense explanation was that all the people at the time knew that Jesus was from Nazareth and that his father was Joseph. This made was obviously a stumbling block for anyone who believed that he was to come from a virgin birth and be from Bethlehem (namely Greek speaking Jews). The authors of Matthew and Luke obviously didn't collaborate on their books (although they did have some shared sources, including Mark), so they each came up with their own different explanations to try and explain these discrepancies. \n \n So the actual truth is probably pretty close to this: Joseph impregnated Mary (they may very well have even been married), and they had the child in Nazareth, where he grew up.

So you screwed that one up too.\n\n \n I see so sin is passed on by the father leaving the woman just a victim of the male failing. Again you should learn some of the more popular denominations and what they think. It would help you not make these errors.\n \n \nThe Trinity has been explained also - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. One God manifested in three persons. You turkeys apparently can't comprehend that either.\n\n \n Ok here you go, explain how this makes sense anyone rational\n \n Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholic Faith. Which Faith except everyone do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. And the Catholic Faith is this, that we worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity. Neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Ghost is all One, the Glory Equal, the Majesty Co-Eternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father Uncreate, the Son Uncreate, and the Holy Ghost Uncreate. The Father Incomprehensible, the Son Incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost Incomprehensible. The Father Eternal, the Son Eternal, and the Holy Ghost Eternal and yet they are not Three Eternals but One Eternal. As also there are not Three Uncreated, nor Three Incomprehensibles, but One Uncreated, and One Uncomprehensible. So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, and the Holy Ghost Almighty. And yet they are not Three Almighties but One Almighty.\n So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not Three Gods, but One God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not Three Lords but One Lord. For, like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by Himself to be God and Lord, so are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion to say, there be Three Gods or Three Lords. The Father is made of none, neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father, and of the Son neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.\n \n So there is One Father, not Three Fathers; one Son, not Three Sons; One Holy Ghost, not Three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is afore or after Other, None is greater or less than Another, but the whole Three Persons are Co-eternal together, and Co-equal. So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped. He therefore that will be saved, must thus think of the Trinity.\n \n Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting Salvation, that he also believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess, that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man.\n \n God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the substance of His mother, born into the world. Perfect God and Perfect Man, of a reasonable Soul and human Flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching His Manhood. Who, although He be God and Man, yet He is not two, but One Christ. One, not by conversion of the Godhead into Flesh, but by taking of the Manhood into God. One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by Unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one Man, so God and Man is one Christ. Who suffered for our salvation, descended into Hell, rose again the third day from the dead. He ascended into Heaven, He sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty, from whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies, and shall give account for their own works. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting, and they that have done evil into everlasting fire. This is the Catholic Faith, which except a man believe faithfully and firmly, he cannot be saved. \n \n \n \nAnd so on down the line.

Matthew traces Jesus's lineage to King David, in a vein attempt to fulfill a prophecy. Luke traces the lineage all the way back to Adam. \n One of the most damning pieces of evidence against the entire story is the fact that Joseph is rarely mention at all. If Mary was a Virgin when Jesus was born then How would Jesus have an older brother? Oh I hear Christians say that the brothers and sisters refer to children from Joseph in a previous marriage, but the Bible doesn't say Joseph was married before. The Catholics believe that Mary remained a Virgin throughout her life, but the bible clearly shows that Jesus had brothers and sisters. \n It's clear to anyone thinking rational what the truth is. \n In those days of the Old Testament Laws it would have been the Death Penalty for Joseph to get Mary pregnant until they were Married. The Biblical stories concerning Joseph say that he was \"Promised\" to marry her, meaning when she got pregnant that had not tied the knot.

That was just what the writers of the gospels tried to do to make a case for Jesus being the Messiah. You're giving too much truth to the narratives. You are assuming that Joseph and Mary actually did the things that would have (presumably) fulfilled the prophecies, and that the authors of the gospels just wrote them down relatively accurately. It's way more likely that the idea of Jesus as the Messiah didn't spring up until very late in Jesus' life (or just as likely shortly after his death). It's a pretty obvious case of Jesus' early life being fabricated in the books to try and fit the mold of the Messiah, not a case of Joseph and Mary actually living these things out. \n \n Both books say that Joseph and Mary were unmarried, because if they were married, the idea that Mary being a virgin would have been pretty ridiculous. It was well known by people that Joseph was his father (see the 'is this not the son of the carpenter' verse in Matthew). Both Matthew and Luke had to try and explain that away. Mark made no attempt to, because Mark was simply about Jesus' ministry. \n \n The genealogies are good examples, though, of what I was saying about the writers trying to telling different stories to fulfill the same prophecies. Both felt like they needed to show that Jesus was a rightful heir to the throne by being descended from David, but both writers also had different points they were trying to get across. Matthew, who went back through Abraham, was trying to show Jesus' Jewishness (as a descendent of the father of the Jews). Luke, who went back through Adam, was trying to show Jesus' humanness (as the savior of all men... since he is a descendent of Adam, like everyone else).\n \n What is really funny is that in Matthew, the author tries to make a claim about there being 14 generations from Abraham to David, then 14 generations from David to the destruction of Judah, then 14 generations until Jesus... but he gets the numbers wrong so that it actually goes 14-14-13. There are also names he left out of his genealogy to fit his agenda.",

In Genesis 2 He creates Adam and Eve and sticks them in a Private Garden to serve as his pets but they screw up and he kicks them out. This would explain why the Jews refer to themselves as the \"Chosen People\" because Adam was the Original Jew. \n \n Concerning the Gospels though, They don't know for sure who wrote what since none of the original texts were signed.

It's like the quote from David Hume: ''Which is more likely: That the whole natural order is suspended or that a Jewish minx should tell a lie?''\n \n But yeah, most people read the two creation counts as complimentary, and take Adam to be the first man and father of everyone. Descendents of Adam turned into all sorts of people; Jews, Egyptians, Hittites, etc. It was God's covenant to Abraham (that Abraham would have a great nation made out of his descendents, which at the time he had none) that actually established the Jewish Nation.\n \n And yeah, pretty much every book of the New Testament got its' name that same way. Except for the 7 epistles that are generally accepted to be written by Paul, the other books are anonymous or written in someone else's name (which was a very common practice in those days, as it gave authority to a book). The Old Testament is way worse though, since none of the authors are known, they were written way later than the already pretty late New Testament books. Plus, there are no originals of any of the books of the bible, leading people to lean on copies of copies of copies (and bibles like the King James version don't even take into account the earliest manuscripts). \n \n What makes it even worse is the number of errors that occurred during the copying process. In around 1700 there was a book written that described 30,000 variations among the New Testament manuscripts alone (I think there were only like 100 manuscripts that he used at the time, and now days we have like 1,000 manuscripts, and the number of variations would be expected to be in the hundreds of thousands).

Law does not define morality.\n\n \n I'm afraid in some cases Law does indeed Define Morality. Just take the definition of Morality..\n \n The term \"morality\" can be used either\n descriptively to refer to some codes of conduct put forward by a society or,\n some other group, such as a religion, or\n accepted by an individual for her own behavior or\n normative to refer to a code of conduct that, given specified conditions, would be put forward by all rational persons.\n \n From The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\n \n We don't need a Bible or a Deity to have a Moral code , unlike many believe. Morals come from people living within a society whom realize that certain things are wrong and certain things are right and these people pass laws or Moral Codes of Conduct that everyone living within that society must follow or they will pay the consequence. Humans didn't need a religion to tell them it was bad to steal from your neighbor. Humans didn't need a religion to tell them it was bad to kill your fellow man. And we didn't need religion to tell us that it was bad to have sex with a minor. \n \n As far as where the age of consent came from or it's purpose, I don't have a definitive answer. Perhaps a Civilized society recognized that until a certain age a person was incapable of making decisions such as having sex, so they took it upon themselves to apply a age limit to consent for sex. I don't know, and to be honest don't really care where it came from. The Point was and is that If the Story of the Virgin birth were true, which is more unlikely than not, then God himself is either a Pedo or an Adulterer.. Pick your choice but he never asked her permission and she only consented after she had been told that this was HIS will. Speaking purely in religious terms and considering the time of the supposed event it was very very unlikely that Joseph himself would have said no to becoming impregnated because the Hebrews of that time FEARED god above all else.",
