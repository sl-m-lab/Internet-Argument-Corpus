   "You think our government is screwed up? It could be worse. We could be in the UK where the Conservatives slaughtered the socialists, but will probably end up with a Leftist government anyway.\n \n \n\n British Prime Minister Gordon Brown offers to step down\n By Anthony Faiola and Dan Balz\n Washington Post Foreign Service \n Tuesday, May 11, 2010 \n LONDON -- After a long and rocky political career spent battling the rival Conservative Party, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown sacrificed the only thing he had left: himself. \n Brown, whose Labor Party suffered massive losses in a second-place finish in Thursday's elections, stood outside No. 10 Downing Street on Monday afternoon and vowed that he would resign by the fall. The dramatic announcement was seen as a last-ditch attempt to open the way to an alliance between his party and the third-place Liberal Democrats, who had strongly suggested that no deal was possible until Brown agreed to step aside. \n The prime minister's move also raised the stakes in the scramble to form a new government, exacerbating a tug of war for power unlike any Britain has seen in a generation. \n For the past three years, Brown has led the country through a tumultuous period punctuated by its ongoing involvement in the war in Afghanistan, a roiling parliamentary expenses scandal and the global financial crisis. In the process, he has become widely unpopular. He acknowledged Monday that his unpopularity was impeding his party's best interests. \n \"The reason that we have a hung Parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country,\" Brown said. \"As leader of my party, I must accept that that is a judgment on me.\" \n The formation of a Conservative-led government would end 13 years of Labor Party rule -- a run that began with the rise of Tony Blair to the premiership. Brown's latest decision was as much a bid for his own party as it was an effort to thwart the Conservatives -- who won the most seats in last week's election but fell short of the parliamentary majority needed to form a government. \n washingtonpost.com \n",
