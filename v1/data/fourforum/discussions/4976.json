   "One consideration that is missing from the debate between the pro-choicers and the pro-lifers is this: When a woman decides to kill her unborn child she is not only killing the flesh and the love that the child would have had for her but she is also sending the soul of that baby back to God and the Angels in Heaven. Imagine how the creator of the universe feels about that. When a woman kills her unborn child and that child gets back to Heaven, what does that child talk to Jesus about. I reckon that baby would be very sad about being killed by her own mother. How could it be otherwise? I wonder what Jesus tells that murdered baby to comfort her and make her feel better? Does the baby who was killed by her own mother hate her mother, or just feel sorry for her? I wonder. I think that the murdered baby would say, \" Momma, why did you kill me, I only wanted to hold you and love you.\"\n A woman's legal right to chose between life and death for her child is the most important decision that she may ever make. If she chooses to abort that baby, she may be killing only one soul, her own. Abortion is wrong, chose life.",
