   "I just finished reading a book titled, Faith of the Fatherless The Psychology of Atheism by Paul C. Vitz  (a pyschologist and former atheist). The book is copyrighted 1999 (fairly recent), a quick read (147 pages) and is available from amazon for about 10 bucks.\n \n Often, theists are accused of seeking God due to a need for a father figure. Belief is seen as a weakness or a pyschological blemish requiring a remedy. However, Vitz proposes the contrary, that atheism may be due to psychological or social factors being more influential than rational argument. \n \n Vitz proposes a new theory of atheism/agnosticism: defective fathers of those who embrace intense atheism. This can include dead, absent, or weak fathers. He examines the famous advocates of atheism (mostly the philosophers, not artists or scientists). \n \n Those who fall into the category with deceased fathers early in their childhood or adolescence are: Nietzsche, David Hume, Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre, Arthur Schopenhauer. \n \n Abusive or weak Fathers: Thomas Hobbes, Voltaire, Feuerbach, Samuel Butler, Sigmund Freud, H.G. Wells\n \n He compares these persons' relationships with important thiest contemporaries of theirs. The atheists are a sort of experimental group, the believers a type of control group. He proposes that the differences in the patterns of the two groups is the relevant evidence of the defective father hypothesis. \n \n He does not propose this as an all encompassing theory and actually in the end rejects it as a basis for debate of the existence of God. He seems to want to put both sides on equal ground in that aspect. He states that believers and nonbelievers alike have pyschological influences and that the pyschology should be irrelevant. He proposes that addressing the pyschology of either group is an ad hominem argument and should not be presented as evidence. He does believe that there is a need to discuss the pyschological and social influences on a personal level though so that any difficult experiences can be addressed.\n \n He does not propose this as a theory concerning everyday atheists/agnostics (only the famous, major advocates) but I wonder if there are any statistics out there addressing the question of fatherhood among atheists? Any comments? It is an interesting read.",
