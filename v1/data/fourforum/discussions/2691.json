   "Pass it on!\n \n The 27 grievances listed in this Declaration are backed up by sources and related reading at www.bushpresident2004.com/declaration-from-bush.htm.\n \n Declaration of Independence from President George II \n July 4, 2004 \n \n When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for a people to dissolve the political forces which have suppressed and divided them, and to assume among the powers of the earth, a separation from these forces to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the differing opinions of others requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. \n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator and Nature with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. - That to secure these rights, Presidential Administrations are instituted among Men and Women, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, - That whenever any Administration becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to replace it, and to institute a new Administration, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to us shall seem most likely to effect our Safety and Happiness. When a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same pattern evinces a design to reduce the People under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. - Such has been the patient sufferance of the American People; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their current Government. The history of the present President of United States [George II] is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. \n \n He came to power through the denial of voting rights from thousands of Citizens in our State of Florida. \n \n He has allowed his Administration to be corrupted and directly controlled by non-citizen corporate interests. \n \n He has enabled and aided the contamination of our Air, Land, and Water to the detriment of our Nation's health and environment. \n \n He has censored and suppressed scientific studies of wide-ranging concern to serve his financial contributors at the expense of our health and well-being. \n \n He has constantly fought efforts to investigate the events leading up to the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 that claimed over 2,700 innocent lives. \n \n He has acted to protect the government of Saudi Arabia, a known supporter of terrorism, by allowing Saudi officials secret passage out of the United States after September 11, 2001 and by censoring reports detailing Saudi ties to terrorists. \n \n He has introduced and signed laws usurping freedoms enshrined in our Bill of Rights, and wages a campaign within our legal system to deny us our sacred Rights to counsel and due process of law. \n \n He has populated his Administration with a radical group of ideologues whose primary goal is the ascension of American global power through military might and control of world oil resources. \n \n He has sent spies to gather information on Delegates of the United Nations in a failed effort to egregiously achieve international support for questionable war. \n \n He has misled our Nation into a war of no necessity through deliberate deception, which continues to cost us the lives of our Soldiers and great public wealth from our Treasury. \n \n He has failed to address legitimate threats to the security of our Nation at home and abroad as the threat of terrorism has increased under his tenure. \n \n He has failed to support our Soldiers under his command. \n \n He has proven his lack of seriousness in the War on Terror by exposing one of our intelligence agents for the sole purpose of political retaliation against her husband. \n \n He has orchestrated the most secretive Administration in memory, denying information from the public about our Government's actions and abuses. \n \n He has plundered our National Treasury for the benefit of the wealthy few and his financial contributors. \n \n He has enabled and accelerated with poor accounting the transfer of our many government services including armed military duties and the counting of our votes to private corporations, who are shielded from public scrutiny and whose motives are questionable. \n \n He has bypassed our Senate's review of his radical judicial appointments by appointing judges while Congress was at recess. \n \n He has ignored the suffering of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs, and fallen into bankruptcy and poverty under his tenure. \n \n He has enabled our Nation's move toward a lawless Tyranny by facilitating the use of torture and murder against prisoners of questionable guilt, while immorally avoiding tenets of domestic and international Law, and common Decency. \n \n He has stood by while our State governments, schools, and hospitals fall into debt and abandon services, showing signs of neither action nor concern. \n \n He has with reckless arrogance devastated our reputation and respect among the Peoples and Nations of the earth and endangered constructive relations with our Allies. \n \n He has carelessly allied his Administration with individuals who manipulated our Government and Media, and passed State secrets to Foreign Powers. \n \n He has waged a campaign of fear to control public opinion and safeguard his rule. \n \n He has been derelict in his position by being absent from his station as President for nearly half of his term. \n \n He has rarely made himself accountable to the Citizenry or the Press - corralling our protests, and making few press conference appearances. \n \n He has led our Nation into the deepest debt in our history. \n \n He has promoted a Constitutional Amendment to limit the freedom of Americans for the sole purpose of igniting hatred for his political gain. \n \n In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A President whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the caretaker of a free people. \n \n Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our President. We have warned him time and time again of attempts by his Administration and his party comrades in Congress to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. Through protest and publications, we have reminded them of the circumstances of our many troubles and grievances. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have entreated them to disavow these usurpations. They have been deaf to the voice of justice and of reason. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, and hold them, as we hold the rest of our Government, as either a benefit to our Freedom and well-being, or a danger. \n \n We, therefore, the People of the United States of America, on Election Day 2004, confident and purposeful in the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority of our sovereign right as United States citizens, solemnly publish and declare, that We the People ought to be Free from this Bush Administration, that we are absolved from all Allegiance to this President, and that all political connection between us and the current occupiers of our White House, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free People, we will have the power once again to levy War only when we see fit, allow Peace without needless and deadly interruption, revitalize our Alliances with friendly foreign Nations, establish healthy Commerce that will not prove devastating to our working families, and to do all other Acts and Things which Free and Independent People may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of natural Justice and divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Efforts, our Fortunes, and our sacred Vote.\n \n The 27 grievances listed in this Declaration are backed up by sources and related reading at www.bushpresident2004.com/declaration-from-bush.htm.",
