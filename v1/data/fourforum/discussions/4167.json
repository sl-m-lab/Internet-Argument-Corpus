   "Here's the basic AP story:\n \n \n \nYAKIMA - Researchers at a national science laboratory in Richland have found a way to achieve in days what takes Mother Nature millions of years: converting wood to mineral. \n \n The ability to make petrified wood could hold promise for separating industrial chemicals, filtering pollutants and soaking up contamination, said Yongsoon Shin, research scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. \n \n \"Wood petrified is very hard and very porous material - it's not really a wood component,\" Shin said yesterday. \n \n Petrified wood has a large, hard surface and a porous inside, making it ideal to soak up or separate substances or act as a catalyst in other processes, Shin said. \n \n Natural petrified wood occurs when trees are buried without oxygen, then leach their wood components and soak up the soil's minerals. \n \n For instance, at the Ginkgo Petrified Forest, a state park on the west shore of the Columbia River in Central Washington, trees were believed to have been buried without oxygen beneath molten lava millions of years ago. \n \n To create petrified wood, the researchers bought pine and poplar boards, gave a half-inch cube of wood an acid bath, then soaked it in a silica solution. The wood was air-dried, cooked in an argon-filled furnace and cooled in argon to room temperature. \n \n The result was a new silicon carbide that exactly replicates petrified wood, Shin said. \n \n The research results were published in the journal Advanced Materials. \n \n \n The researchers now are trying to make the material even more porous, which would make it even more useful in the industrial world, Shin said. \n \n \"If pores are too big or too small, it's not too useful,\" he said. \n \n The Richland lab is a research center operated by the U.S. Department of Energy. It works on complex problems in energy, national security, the environment and life sciences. The laboratory employs nearly 4,000 people and has a $650 million annual budget. \n",

While there is a long list, here's just one more that came up recently.\n \n http://www.htmlhelp.org/reference/html40/phrase/acronym.html\n \n The ACRONYM element is used to markup acronyms. The TITLE attribute is useful in conjunction with ACRONYM to give the long form of the acronym, allowing visual browsers to provide the long form as a \"tooltip\".

For example, \"SQL\" and \"URL\" are pronounced as words by some people and pronounced letter-by-letter by others. In such cases, authors should use the ABBR element, possibly with a style sheet rule specifying the pronunciation for aural rendering.",
