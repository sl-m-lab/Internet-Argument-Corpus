   "I can tell you've never engaged in anal sex before. But I'll give you a quick lesson:\n \nNo, whether or not you think it is right is another matter, the fact is, when a man gets an erection over another man, and he inserts his penis, (that is designed for the vagina), and forces it into the anus, (the very region of the body that is solely designed to emit human waste), and the continues to ejaculate sperm, (designed to swim to the human egg within the woman), into and onto the human waste, then even those with low logical ability can and must see that this is disgusting.\n 1. The erection usually happens because the other man is handsome, charming, intelligent, and funny - a figure of erotic attraction. \n \n 2. Unless you're into some seriously rough stuff, no force is involved. Like every other muscle in your body, your anus is very flexible. Lots of foreplay is necessary to loosen it up though, and to produce a state in which penetration is pleasurable rather than painful and intrusive. \n \n 3. You have to be squeaky clean back there, a state I've noticed that many straight men have great difficulty achieving. \n \n 4. Use a condom. I really can't stress this enough. Female condoms are especially good for anal play. \n \n 5. Lots of lubricant is necessary as well, because an anus does not produce its own like a vagina.\n \n 6. Anal sex is about the person on the bottom (aka 'bottoms'). And this may surprise you, but not all gay men like to be penetrated anally.\n \n 7. Semen ain't gold. It's common, your average man produces enough each day to fertilize thousands of eggs. They're designed to be produced in expendible quantities. And if you have to fantisize about Johnny Depp in order to fertilize your wife's eggs, you probably shouldn't be married to her in the first place. \n \n \nHomosexuality has been proven wrong, theologically and scientifically.\n Proven theologically? This really caught my interest. Could you please provide a link to a copy of that proof?

The fact you have to use lube is a statement that proves it is unnatural, you sick fudge packer!\n Oh?

Sex is an expression of love and intimacy between persons and may be used for reproductive purposes, or for simply reinforcing pair-bonds and expressing love. This unitelelogical assumption is a fallacy stretching back to Aristotle, who argued that one of the four universal causes of things was a single teleological cause, the end to which those were put. Amusingly this fallacy is belayed by the very devices that we are using to communicate: computers trade on the design of the 'universal Turing machine', a device capable of performing a variety of functions, and consequently fulfilling a variety of ends and purposes. \n \n I think it was David Hume, a buddy of Benjamin Franklin, who pointed out that you can't derive an 'ought' (or moral statement) solely from a set of 'is' (or empirical statements). Here's a link to help explain why this is: http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/4t.htm#intro \n \n And perhaps unsurprisingly there are quite a few homosexuals who use sex to reproduce, either those who didn't notice anything odd about their lack of sexual interest in their opposite-sex spouse, or those who aren't willing to pay for in vitro fertilization when a few moments of social awkwardness is much cheaper. \n \nAnd homosexuality is wrong scientifically because sex is for generating new life, the penis is not designed for the anus, not to be beat off with the hand or mouth, that is a FACT!\n You're confusing sex with reproduction. In nature reproduction has been observed to happen either asexually or sexually. Similarly in nature sex has been observed to happen with and without reproduction. Moreover assigning teleological definitions to natural kinds is a fallacy - especially when those natural kinds and their functions are defined by some intentional scheme that exists above and beyond what is observed.",

In this case, the overwhelming majority of reference resources only have one  definition for the adjective homosexual: one that refers to attraction to the same sex and makes no mention of sexual behavior. Humpty Dumpty-like, anti-gay propagandists want to change that, because they don't like people to know that gay people feel love for each other like straight people do, and that in fact experience the same romantic (as well as sexual) impulses as heterosexuals only towards the same gender. They want to constantly conjure up the boogeyman of specific sexual acts so that people will go \"ick\"... or perhaps because they themselves have an obsession with those acts. In addition, because behavior is a choice, and attraction is not, the accepted definition flies in the face of their whole \"homosexuality is a sin\" mantra, and they certainly can't have that!
