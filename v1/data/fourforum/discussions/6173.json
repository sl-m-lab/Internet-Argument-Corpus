   " This is from the Creation and Evolution thread here at this site, and was posted 07/22/2005.\n \n *************************************\n The Skeptic: DamEtel, I will probably come back to this thread after my debate with Clive is over. \n *************************************\n \n *************************************\n DamEtel: When you do, we should start with the most crushing counter to the YEC position: the one I started with, about radiometric dating of the oldest exposed rocks on Earth, moon rocks, and meteorites. \n *************************************\n \n\n \n \n I'm not going to start any new discussions, but this one deserves to be finished. Can you link to your original posts?\n\n \n \n What I am going to do instead is start a new thread. Hopefully, it will stay focused on just this one issue (you've got the thread name and a date to use in narrowing down the search: you can find the original posts if you want.)\n \n \n \n \n \n How old does radiometric dating show the Earth and the Universe to be? Much older than 10 thousand years: about 4.5 billion years for the Earth, and therefore, at least that old for the Universe.\n \n For various reasons (subduction, erosion, volcanism, impact events, etc.), scientists cannot get their hands on the rocks that formed the Earth's original surface. But they do have access to rocks of great antiquity. Using a variety of different radioisotopes to calculate the age of one group of rocks gave consistent results of 3.7 billion year.\n \n \n\"The oldest rocks exposed on the surface of the earth are 3.5 to 3.8 billion years in age. Consider the various dating methods applied to the Greenland Amitsoq Gneiss: \n \n Rb-Sr isochron 3.70 +- 0.14 billion years\n Pb-Pb isochron 3.80 +- 0.12 billion years\n U-Pb discordia 3.65 +- 0.05 billion years\n Th-Pb discordia 3.65 +- 0.08 billion years\n Lu-Hf isochron 3.55 +- 0.22 billion years\n \n Note that all of the methods agree (3.68-3.70 is within all of their ranges of error). Isochron and discordia methods also have an internal check which identifies undateable samples. Similar formations which give similar ages can be found as well in North America, India, Russia, Australia, and Africa. This date therefore merits some confidence.\" \n (http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/debate-age-of-earth.html) \n\n \n It is important to stress that the dating methods represented in the above table have internal checks by their very design. This built-in self-check helps ensure that even a single isochron-derived age, such as the one based on Rb-Sr above, is reliable. Confidence in the correctness of that age is increased when a second isochron-derived age (based on a different parent-daughter set of isotopes, such as the Pb-Pb one above), which also has passed its own internal data-consistency check, is consistent with the first. And when a third isochron-derived age (using yet a third set of isotopes, such as the Lu-Hf isochron above), which also passed its own internal validation, is consistent with the other two isochron-derived ages, there is little doubt that confidence in the values is warranted.\n \n To get a better idea of how old the Earth itself (not just its' oldest exposed rocks) is, we need to switch to looking at other bodies in the solar system; ones that unlike the Earth are geologically and meteorologically dead. Two prime candidates are the moon and meteorites. Do the results of applying radiometric dating methods to them produce results consistent with the results obtained using the Earth's oldest exposed rocks? Yes. \n \n In order to determine the age of a class of meteorites known as carbonaceous chondrites, several groups of scientists measured the age of CAIs (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions) found in them.\n \n \n\"In contrast to the relative age dating achieved with 26Al-26Mg radioactive decay, absolute formation ages of CAIs and chondrules may be measured with the 207Pb/206Pb [lead-207/lead-206] chronometer. This lead-lead age is based on radioactive decay of two long-lived radioactive isotopes 235U [uranium-235] and 238U [uranium-238]. The uncertainties of 207Pb/206Pb dates can be as low as 0.5-1.5 My [million years], thus the 207Pb/206Pb chronometer may be suitable for resolving a potential 2-3 My age difference between CAIs and chondrules. C. All\u00e9gre, G. Manhes, and C. G\u00f6pel (Paris Geophysical Institute) report an impressively precise Pb-Pb age of 4566\u00b12 Ma for CAIs from the Allende CV chondrite.\" (http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html) \n\n \n Thus, the calcium-aluminum inclusions contained in the meteorites were radiometrically dated to 4.566 billion years (plus or minus 2 million years). And as science demands, the general results were repeatable.\n \n \n\"In our recently published paper in Science magazine, we report Pb-Pb isochron ages for two CAIs (E60 and E49) from the CV carbonaceous chondrite Efremovka and a similarly precise Pb isotopic age for chondrules from the CR carbonaceous chondrite Acfer 059. We also report the 26Al-26Mg systematics for the CAI E60. \n \n The Pb-Pb isochron age for the Acfer 059 chondrules is 4564.7\u00b10.6 Ma. The weighted average Pb-Pb isochron age for the Efremovka CAIs is 4567.2\u00b10.6 Ma.\" (http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html) \n\n \n Switching to second candidate for undisturbed rocks, radiometric dating of the oldest lunar rocks produced ages remarkably consistent with the values for the CAIs from meteorites.\n \n \n\n Description Technique Age (billions of years)\n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.55 +- 0.1 \n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.60 +- 0.1 \n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.49 \n Apollo 17 Rb-Sr isochron 4.43 +- 0.05 \n Apollo 17 Sm-Nd isochron 4.23 +- 0.05 \n Apollo 17 Sm-Nd isochron 4.34 +- 0.05 \n Apollo 16 40Ar/39Ar 4.47 \n Apollo 16 40Ar/39Ar 4.42 \n (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html)\n \n\n \n Sticking with the dating of moon samples for a minute, we can see the high degree of internal consistency produced by applying multiple dating methods to a single sample (note however, that it is not one of the oldest moon rocks). The following table is based on one at http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html (which itself lists as its reference for this data, \"Age of the Earth\", G. Brent Dalrymple, 1991). The data pertain to the dating a single moon rock brought back by Apollo 11, sample 10072.\n \n \n\n Technique Age (billions of years)\n 40Ar/39Ar whole rock 3.49 +- 0.05 \n 40Ar/39Ar whole rock 3.52 +- 0.04 \n 40Ar/39Ar plagioclase 3.57 +- 0.05 \n 40Ar/39Ar plagioclase 3.56 +- 0.06 \n 40Ar/39Ar ilmenite 3.58 +- 0.05 \n 40Ar/39Ar pyroxene 3.55 +- 0.05 \n Rb-Sr isochron 3.57 +- 0.05 \n Sm-Nd isochron 3.57 +- 0.03 \n \n\n \n So whether radiometrically dating (1) exposed rocks on Earth, (2) basaltic rocks retrieved from the moon, or (3) calcium-aluminum inclusions in meteorites, the results all point to an Earth that is about 4.5 billion years old, and not one of them is consistent, at all, with a Biblically young Earth. Further, not only were multiple objects dated, but multiple methods for calculating were used, and all results produced were found to be consistent.",

   "First of all, I want to state that I am not an expert on dating methods used in this area of science. My real passion is biology. I have, however, been debating the issue for some time now, since it is a popular topic on forums like this one. \n \n To start, allow me to hack away at the general concept behind your ideas: that the present is the key to the past (ie, we see a small amount of erosion now, so it must have taken millions of years to dig this valley in the past). This is a flawed idea, since we can rarely be sure of the distant past.\n \n From: http://www.trueorigin.org/dating.asp\n \n \"Many dating methods seem to give about the same ages on meteorites. Thus radiometric dating methods appear to give evidence that the earth and meteorites are old, if one accepts the fact that decay rates have been constant. However, there may be other explanations for this apparent age. Perhaps the earth was made from older pre-existing matter, or perhaps decay rates were briefly faster for some reason. When one considers the power of God, one sees that any such conclusions are to some extent tentative.\"\n \n This would also apply to the other dates that you are talking about. The idea that everything was created from pre-existing matter is self-explanatory - the idea that decay rates were faster in the past is known as the Theory of Accelerated Decay. More information on accelerated decay (which is a rather complex topic) can be found at these links:\n \n http://www.icr.org/pdf/research/RATE_ICC_Chaffin.pdf\n http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/37/37_1/chaffin/acceldecay.html\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v14/i1/decay_rate.asp\n http://www.rae.org/clocks.html\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v15/i2/acceleration.asp\n \n The RATE group at ICR is currently doing a large amount of research on ToAD, so you should be seeing a lot more material coming out in the near future.\n \n TS",

This is a flawed idea, since we can rarely be sure of the distant past.\n\n \n Don't even try to draw an analogy between erosion and radioactive decay, they're completely different. Rates of erosion vary widely depending upon the acidity of the rain, the composition of the rock, the temperature, the volume of precipitation per unit time, etc. Rates of radioactive decay, on the other hand, are constant in that they are not changed by pressure, temperature, humidity, acidity, and so on.\n \n I'll also point out that while I provided multipe, consistent, VERY SPECIFIC empirical data, you offer up here nothing but a VERY VAGUE a unconvincing \"counter\".

   "As in, heated up, I suppose? Sorry, I'm a little bit hazey on the radio-active isotopes, and what changes the rate of decay (if anything).\nActually, yes, as in last heated above certain (now) well known temperatures which are known to reset certain element ratios that are used in radiometric dating. As for what changes the rate of decay, zippo, zilch, nada, nothing that those elements have been subjected to on earth. Now, a supernova is another matter.\n \nNo, when it forms. The indvidual atoms, when first formed, will have a specific percentage of the various isotopes (Give or take a certain percentage). After a period of time, those ratios will change.\nYes. That may be true across the universe. And those ratios are theoretically known. However, what matters for use in radiometric dating is not the ratios of isotopes of the same element. What matters is the ratio of a radioactive element and it's decay product. The ratios of those elements elements are set when the rock is formed - that's why volcanic rock is usually quite reliable - or when other kinds of rocks undergo metamorphism. Correct selection of samples for dating is critical. That is why sedimentary rock isn't suitable for radiometric dating.\n \n One example of creationist honesty is the argument often presented about the radiometric dating of 800 yr old lava from a volcano in Hawaii. The creationists claim that radiometric dating is unreliable because the lava was dated at two different ages in the millions of years. Funny. Creationists got the idea from a paper about the errors produced if care was not taken to eliminate mafic inclusions from the samples - in other words, chunks of rock that were not melted but were ejected from the volcano in the lava.\n \n The principal elements used in radiometric dating are: 40K/40Ar, 87Rb/87Sr, 147Sm/143Nd, 176Lu/176Hf, 187Re/187Os, 232Th/208Pb, 235U/207Pb, 238U/206Pb.\n \n And, of course, there is 14C/12C, which is not a ratio between a parent and a daughter element. The principle of radio carbon dating is a bit different, and of course, only good for dating formerly living organic material of less than about 50,000 years. If you want it explained and can't find an explanation on one of Tim Thompson's pages below, I'll try it for those who ask.\n \n If you are interested in the topic, read The Age of the Earth by G. Brent Dalrymple. The book grew out of Dalrymple's studies of creationism in preparation to testify in the case of Segraves v. State of California as an expert witness on geology. Chapter 3 in entitled, \"Modern Radiometric Methods: How They Work.\"\n \n Also of interest and of great educational value are Tim Thompson's pages Tim is a planetary physicist at JPL. Relevant to this discussion is his A Radiometric Dating Resource List. If you have a specific question about radiometric dating, one of Tim's links probably has the answer.\n \n The other titles linked on that page are also of particular relevance to various creationist arguments for a young earth.\n \n (Additional note: I am not quite correct in stating that nothing can change the decay rate of radioactive elements. My son (a nuclear engineer) once informed me of some tests he did as a student. One isotope of beryllium (I think) showed an increased decay rate when subjected to extreme pressures, in the range of those necessary to form diamonds from carbon. But that was because the method of radio decay was by electron capture. I presume that other elements with isotopes that decay by electron capture can have the decay rates altered by means that increase the likelihood that an electron will be captured. Other wise, the elements used in radiometric dating aren't changed by any natural means.",

Let everyone see what we have to say. I'm not about to carry on a private discussion through private messages with you aside from a thread on the same topic. Please, in the future, respond in the thread itself.\n \n I understand the point you thought you were making, that there is no argument because both ideas are just \"theries.\" Perhaps it would be to your benefit to read my remarks in this post. I think they address the issue of scientific theories. In fact, no matter what you mean when you say that creationism and evolution are both theories, you are wrong. If, by theory, you mean some sort of speculative guess based on dogma or mythology or just the way you'd like it to be, without any supporting evidence, then yes; creationism is a theory. But evolution is not. If by theory you mean an explanation based on empirical evidence that is predictive of natural phenomena and has been rigorously tested and found to hold true under a variety of natural conditions, then no, creationism is not a theory, but yes evolution is.\n \n But I do agree that both ideas have a time and a place to be presented. Evolution, since it is the major theory on which all of the biological sciences are based should be presented in science classes. Creationism, since it is a religiously motivated idea based on the dogma and mythology of ancient, nomadic herdsmen, should be taught in an appropriate home or church, or in classes of comparative religion or mythology in our schools.\n \n And yes, I have noticed that when I try to play the the creationists rules and wallow in the mud like they do, they like it.\n \n Please limit further communications to the appropriate threads on this board.",

So I'll just give a brief, simplistic explanation here.\n \n The real key players are transcription factors - proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and thereby modify the expression of one or more other genes. Transcription factors, like other proteins, are coded for by genes, and Hox genes code for the ones involved in axis specification. We can compare the Hox genes in mammals with those in fruit flies and see the obvious relatedness between them, not only in the highly conserved sequences themselves but also in the physical placement of genes along the chromosomes. Many regulatory genes (coding for transcription factors) are expressed in various regions in the developing embryo. For example, Pax-6 is expressed in the lens and cornea, the pancreas, the retina, and the neural tube. Functioning in so many different regions, in combination with different genes, a change in the sequence of such a regulatory gene would likely be deleterious. Hence, the highly conserved nature of genes such as Pax-6 and others like it. What tends to occur instead is that a mutation occurs in one of the different regulatory sites (enchancers, promoters, etc.) that themselve regulate expression of the regulatory gene in different regions. This allows the expression of the transcription factor (and therefore its affects) to be changed without needing to change the sequence of its gene. So the typical change for these types of genes is that the amount of the transcription factor produced in one area of the embryo is increased or decreased, thereby shifting its zone of influence. This can lead to changes in the size, shape, or number of embryonic structures, such vertebrae. For example, the interaction of different zones of influence of several Hox genes is the reason why snakes, humans, and mice have different numbers of vertebrae, and different numbers of the same kind of vertebrae.",

For example, the interaction of different zones of influence of several Hox genes is the reason why snakes, humans, and mice have different numbers of vertebrae, and different numbers of the same kind of vertebrae.\n\n \n Hey Elliott (and others), here are a few links that discuss the Hox genes roles in controlling the kind of vertebrae. \n \n The first is short and a tad bit technical, and not all that informative: I added it because it completes the picture, filling in part of the gap the second link leaves open (that is, the first link deals with the Hox genes involved in producing cervical - that is, \"neck\" - vertebrae).\n \n The second is the best of the group. It's long enough to be very informative and is written with the general public as its target. It covers several different Hox genes and how they control development of vertebrae, as well as their role in controlling development of the limbs. \n \n The third is a slightly technical paper which also deals with the cervical vertebrae. It attempts to answer the question, \"Why do 'all' mammals - from the long-necked giraffes and camels down to the short-necked humans and mice - have 7 cervical vertebrae?\" After all, mammals have different numbers of other types of vertebrae, so why not cervical ones too? And, birds and reptiles and amphibians have varying number of cervical vertebrae, so why not mammals too? The paper draws upon correlations between adnormalities in the cervical vertebrae and neonatal cancers. The idea is that the Hox genes involved in controlling the development of the cervical vertebrae in mammals also control cell proliferation in mammals, such that evolutionary \"experimentation\" with cervical verbrebrae number is prohibited by the concomittant cancers of newborns that would occur. Why would this constraint on cervical vertebrae number affect only mammals, and not other vertebrates as well? It could be related to the high metalobic rate of mammals compared to reptiles and amphibians (leading to more free-radical dammage in mammals, and thus, potential cancer), and also the fact that birds and reptiles do not seem to be nearly as susceptible to non-viral cancers as mammals are.\n \n http://www.bioscience.org/knockout/ref/horan.htm\n \n http://www.utah.edu/unews/releases/03/jul/skeleton.html\n \n http://wwworm.biology.uh.edu/evodevo/lecture11/galis99.pdf",

No one is born a Creationist: no one is even born believing in God, or Jesus. \n \n People are taught to believe in those things by society. And churches just love to get their hands on young children. Maybe I should rephrase that, considering all of the child molesting and rapes committed by Catholic priests. Churches love to indoctrinate children at as young an age as possible. You know, while the kids still believe in Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and other kinds of imaginary beings: while they are still naive and susceptible to belief in the unsupportable. Then, every Sunday - for many people, twice on Sunday and also Wednesday too - and at Vacation Bible School too, the children are brainwashed into believing in God. They are convinced that God really exists before they are old enough to think critically, and are not exposed to the altnerative. Religious indoctrination is an example of taking advantage of others when they are most vulnerable. Sounds like Catholic priests again :-)",

   "I'm not a massive expert on US culture, but there are several striking historical facts which suggest reasons for the unusual (in Western culture) popularity of fundamentalist religion there.\nNor am I an expert on US culture since I am not an anthropologist or an historian specializing in that field. On the other hand, I have spent my life of moderately advanced years living and observing US culture from coast to coast and border to border. I have also made an effort to study the history of my country.\n \n1) The first colonists were mostly Puritans, and they believed (and many still do) that the New World was literally the New Israel, the Kingdom promised in the Bible, which happened to be full of heathens who were eradicated, in the end for essentially economic reasons, but originally I would guess that no-one had a problem with killing them because they weren't white Christians.\n\n Absolutely false. The Puritans settled Massachusetts Bay Colony and their influence was limited mostly to New England. The middle colonies were economic ventures that were nominally Church of England. Georgia was a prison colony.\n \n2) The vast majority of Pioneer literature was revisionist in the sense that it just doesn't mention the American Indians, and describes an \"empty, virgin land of endless beauty and magnificence\". (this isn't an exact quote but it's from an 18th century US book I read at school, and my teachers assured me that it was typical of the literature of the time, sorry I can't give a source). The genocide of the aboriginal population was only nationally recognised in the 20th century.\nActually, shortly after the initial settlements, the land was almost empty. The early settlers, who actually didn't attempt to exterminate the native populations, introduced European diseases that decimated native Americans. By the time the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, there were very few native Americans left in the area. Consider that the landing at Plymouth Rock was in 1620 and Concord, some 60 miles inland, was settled in 1635, and Lexington in 1640. The middle colonies actually experienced more conflict with the natives than the Puritans. And in those colonies, even though there was some initial conflict between settlers and colonists, it was not genocide that won the war, but the introduction of diseases to which the native Americans had no resistance. Thus the land became empty.\n \n3) The concept of an empty land, made available for religious emigrants from the more decadent European societies which then experienced unprecedented economic growth and amazingly high standards of living (for the white population at least), has, I believe, led more than anything else to the concept of 'manifest destiny': \n \"...a phrase that expressed the belief that the United States had a divinely inspired mission to expand, to progress, and to spread its form of democracy and freedom. Originally a political catch phrase of the nineteenth century, Manifest Destiny eventually became a standard historical term, often used as a synonym for the territorial expansion of the United States across North America towards the Pacific Ocean.\nYes indeed. It seems to have been the will of some god that the US expand from shore to shore. But the initial encounters were \"won\" by Europeans because of the diseases they introduced. And when the colonies began to expand to the west and encounter indigenous populations that had gained some resistance to the introduced diseases and whose population numbers had bounced back, then conflicts arose. It was the Puritans (Cotton Mather for example) who led the efforts to exterminate native Americans in New England. He was almost successful.\n \nManifest Destiny was always a general notion rather than specific policy or ideology. In addition to territorial expansionism, the term also encompassed notions of idealism, American exceptionalism, nationalism, and a belief in the inherent greatness of what was then called the 'Anglo-Saxon race' \"\n - Wikipedia (my emphasis)\nI guess I can't argue with that. In the latter years of the 1800s the policy was to confine native Americans to reservations, where the government would support them. Unfortunately, \"Indian Agents\" were many times thieves so that reservation life became impossible. It became a matter of leave the reservations or starve. Thus, there was war between the U.S. Army and the Indian nations.\n \n4) The church is, and has always been, very rich and very influential in the US, no matter what the constitution says about the separation of church and state. This is an inevitable consequence of the formative colonial years.\nWhat church is that? Actually, only 8 to 16% of revolutionary colonists attended church. That the \"church\" is big business now is without question. Drugstores and churches seem to be the defining structures of our civilization. The separation of church and state wasn't really a problem until the launch of Sputnik. Schools didn't actually try to instill an understanding of science before then. Schools presented science as a list of immutable \"facts.\" After Sputnik, we realized that we weren't teaching science. Efforts to correct the situation were met by resistance from religious fundamentalists, since science doesn't support a literal reading of the Bible. Thus arose \"creation science,\" an effort to jam religion into science classrooms.\n \n5) Apart from two recent localised disasters (9/11 and Katrina) the US has never suffered a major national catastrophe, unless you include the depression, which was followed by the greatest economic recovery of all time in the post-war era.\nYou've got a short memory. Does Alexander ring a bell? How about Camile? What about the Galveston hurricane of 1900? What about various and sundry earthquakes on the west coast of the US?\n \n And I guess it isn't a disaster if there is some sort of economic recovery, no matter how many people starved to death. It wasn't the \"post-war era\" that was responsible for the recovery. It was the war. War production sucked up every able bodied person, even women, to carry on the war effort. And that was in spite of the deficit spending that caused unheard of inflation.\n \n And that greatest economic recovery was primed by returning vets who went to college on the GI bill. They ended up paying many times more in taxes because of their increased earning power than they were ever paid by a grateful country. Because of my service and my eligibility for the GI bill, I became able to pay taxes at the maximum level, and not once did have to ask if you wanted \"fries with that.\"\n \nThe World Wars themselves, I believe, only contributed to the idea of the US being God's favoured country, as the population not only experienced victory twice, but victory over the forces of oppression and over adversaries against whom it was not necessary for the US to go to war.\nI can't really argue with that. If I pray to Jebus for some particular outcome, that that outcome happens, then I assume that it was my prayers, rather then the valor and death of millions of soldiers that turned the tide. It's sick.\n \nI highlighted the phrase 'American exceptionalism' in the quote from Wikipedia because that is the crux of the issue. It is this belief, which I have encountered in many intelligent, open-minded Americans that the US genuinely is morally and culturally superior to the rest of the world, although they are too polite to just say it like that.\nBullroar. Americans aren't too polite to say that. I've heard that idea expressed often. It doesn't matter that our universities are staffing senior teaching positions from other countries because we are not educating our own. We are, of course, superior even if we are exporting technical jobs to other countries because of the difficulty in finding qualified applicants in this country.\n \nAny major criticism of the world's sole superpower is generally met with real anger and disbelief, even from those who oppose the Iraq war.\nNot so. I am willing to listen to the criticism. But the fact remains that the US still has a really big military with really spectacular weapons, and if you **** off our President, he will take you down. The problem is as it has always been. Guerrilla war (as in \"insurgents\") can't be countered by conventional military forces. Our President isn't an historian and therefore didn't learn that lesson from VietNam.\n \nIt is this favoured-by-God, exceptionalist approach which allows the US to engage in wars like Vietnam and Iraq, and the general oppression of Central and South America without the population getting too upset or asking too many questions.\nIndeed! A question that I have asked and for which I have received no answer.\n \nWe had exactly the same attitude in Britain at the height of the Empire, that we were doing short term damage in the colonies for long term good reasons, a cruel-to-be-kind philosophy.\nRight! We'll kill as many as we have to to protect you from heathenism.\n \nHowever, the US has an extra dimension to its exceptionalist ideology in that unlike Britain, the US was founded by religious purists and founded on idealistic notions which have constantly reinforced the moral superiority outlook even during times when it is obvious that the Government is not upholding those same idealistic notions.\nActually not. Check my sig. The majority of the \"founding fathers\" were either deists or Unitarians. There has always been an undercurrent of religious fundamentalism (although I am aware that \"fundamentalism\" is a movement of the 20th century), but it didn't really take hold until about 1960. The US was from the beginning founded on the principals of the separation of church and state. It seems that you have been duped by American fundamentalists to believe that it was otherwise.",

People who have seen their country totally devastated are much less likely to hold on to any belief that they are the special proteges of a partisan god.",

   "Nor am I an expert on US culture...\n\n \n Fair enough, thanks for clearing up some of my misconceptions. Most enlightening. \n However I do agree with JH that the disastrous events you mention are nothing compared to the scale of suffering experienced in other countries. That was the point I was trying to make there.\n \n \nThe majority of the \"founding fathers\" were either deists or Unitarians. There has always been an undercurrent of religious fundamentalism (although I am aware that \"fundamentalism\" is a movement of the 20th century), but it didn't really take hold until about 1960. The US was from the beginning founded on the principals of the separation of church and state. It seems that you have been duped by American fundamentalists to believe that it was otherwise\n\n \n Again, fair enough, but what I meant was the idealistic (secular) notions enshrined within the constitution have contributed to the feeling of moral superiority. We constantly hear US pundits, politicians, and citizens, referring to the US as \"the land of the free\", \"this great country\", etc etc. Combined with the patriotism in schools (unless I'm wrong that you still salute the flag in class) and the concept of Manifest Destiny it is easy to see why extreme religious views are held by so many, usually by those whose patriotism is just as extreme.\n I mean if Tony Blair went on TV and started talking about the UK like Bush talks about the US it would be laughable, because we have learnt from history that we are nothing special, that if God exists we are certainly not the apple of his eye.",
