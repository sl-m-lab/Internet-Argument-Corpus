We're all going to hell in a handbasket according to the Chicken Littles here. \n \n \n Once again, you defeat your own argument due to the fact that you are not bright enough to even understand your argument. With stockpiles being at a 6 year high, oil prices should be at a 6 year low according to your model, where prices are controlled strictly by supply and demand. Why is it not? why is it up only for dollar based countries? You have still failed to answer that question. Symbiote asked it as the last question in the previous thread where you displayed your stupidity:\n \n \nThen how do you account for the discrepancy in the change in cost of oil in US dollars vs the cost of oil in Australian, New Zealand or Canadian dollars, or in Euros?\n\n \n Instead of being at a 6 year low, oil prices are still roughly mirroring dollar decline.\n \n You seem excited at the decline of the Euro, but a decline in the euro is not the same as an increase in the dollar. The Euro has shown some (somewhat rare) independant movement. The dollar is still down against EVERY major currency. Sorry. you can toss out rediculous ignorance all day, but a person has only to look at a long term graph to see the truth. Even with the Euro in decline against the dollar recently (which is widely being viewed as a short term lull), it is still up against the dollar over 45% over the last 5 years. \n \n Did you see what happened to the dollar earlier this month when evidence pointed to an unpegging of the yuan? The dollar headed to the cellar, right along with treasure prices. That is becuase there is probably not an expert on the planet who failes to recognise that the yuan is helping prop up the dollar, and that China will probably stop buying US treasury notes once the move to a fully convertible currency, which will seriously hamper our borrowing power (not that the treasury department has actually managed to move a full bond issue for years anyway).\n \n Once again, you prove your lack of understanding of even the most basic financial concepts.",
