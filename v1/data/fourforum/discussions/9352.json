   "According to this site, it's 0.28%. So if this is true (I'm not sure if this is credible or not, someone else pointed it out to me), that means if we were to eliminate EVERY SINGLE thing that caused any greenhouse gasses (stopped driving cars altogether, stopped using AC, heaters, etc.) there would still be 99.72% of the gasses there are now. According to Gore in \"An Inconvenient Truth\" small changes such as restrictions on cars and such would be enough to stop global warming. So which is it? I think we all know global warming is happening, it's just whether humans are causing it and whether it will continue to warm at this rate or whether it will beigin cooling in the future again. According to this site we really can't do much to change it and it is mostly natural. According to Gore we're in danger and need to stop this tragedy that we can prevent. I hate it when people come up with different facts. Different opinions are natural, but when people give different \"facts\" one of them must be wrong.

Uranium is very common in the 40's we stopped mining uranium because we had so much of it that mining any more was useless. Have you ever heard of radon gas? It is every where, do you know what it is it is a by product of uraniun as it decomposes. And nuclear power is not dangerious where did you get that from. I have been around Nuclear power for 40 years and have designed and worked on the plants. Lets give you a perspective on that type of power, did you know that 1 uranium pellet (which is the size of a thimble )would power NY city for 48 hours, to do the same with coal it would take 600 railroad cars full of coal.We have a secure area to despose of the waste it's in a salt dome in the mid west.

   "Frankly I'm always quite amazed that people are willing to believe the 100 year forecast of a bunch of scientists when they can't even give me a good 1 year forecast. Don't think that any of these scientists is willing to give us a prediction about whether or not the next couple of summers are going to be hot, mild or cold. But the 100 year forecast is a sound as it's going to be.\n \n 30 years ago, when all the science was in, the worlds leading scientists claimed that we were going to have global cooling and that we'd all freeze to death. Funy how that didn't work out.\n \n Fact is that the climate always changes, its has done so long before humans were around and it will do so long after we're gone.\n But as usual mankind is so arrogant to think that there is such a thing as \"normal weather\" and that the Earth should always be a constant 21 degrees Celsius. Any deviation from this constant room temperature is not only strange, but also unnatural and unwanted. And if the climate does change, then naturally it's our fault. There is of course no way that the planet's climate can change without it being caused by the masters of the universe, Man. Things like a big ball of nuclear fusion 1.3 million times the size of Earth couldn't possibly affect our climate. The more logical conclusion would be that we humans did it.\n \n I've also noticed that global warming denial is coming close to Holocaust denial. Naturally any real discussion about the how, what and why is not permitted and any voice of dissent is quickly ridiculed and silenced.\n \n It's a brave new world people, let's all just sit and count the hours untill our governments introduce the eco-tax. You know, to protect ourselves from ourselves.",
