   "I'm sure you've seen it on the news by now.\n Who is responsible for all this? Who benefited, who do we blame, and who do we punish?\n \n The story,\n Audit shows $8.8 billion in Iraq funds missing:\n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5763483/\n http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/article_4938.shtml\n http://www.iraqrevenuewatch.org/links/index.shtml\n Some links:\n http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=57118\n A Rep. puts a partisan spin on it:\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29810-2004Jul5.html\n Links to what's going on in the House:\n http://www.house.gov/reform/min/inves_admin/admin_contracts.htm\n \n \nby Reuters Halliburton also benefited\n While the International Advisory and Monitoring Board said the audit found no evidence of fraud in spending by the CPA after the U.S. invasion in March 2003, it said oversight was insufficient to ensure money was used for its intended purposes.\n \n One of the main benefactors of the Iraq funds was the Texas-based firm Halliburton, which was paid more than $1 billion out of those funds to bring in fuel for Iraqi civilians.\n \n The monitoring board said despite repeated requests it had not been given access to U.S. audits of contracts held by Halliburton, which was once run by Vice President Dick Cheney, and other firms that used the development funds.\n\n \n \nby Rep. Waxman  When President Clinton was in office, Congress exercised its oversight powers with no sense of proportionality. But oversight of the Bush administration has been even worse: With few exceptions, Congress has abdicated oversight responsibility altogether.\n \n Republican Rep. Ray LaHood aptly characterized recent congressional oversight of the administration: \"Our party controls the levers of government. We're not about to go out and look beneath a bunch of rocks to try to cause heartburn.\"\n \n Republican leaders in Congress have refused to investigate who exposed covert CIA agent Valerie Plame, whose identity was leaked after her husband, Joe Wilson, challenged the administration's claims that Iraq sought nuclear weapons.\n .......\n Compare the following: Republicans in the House took more than 140 hours of testimony to investigate whether the Clinton White House misused its holiday card database but less than five hours of testimony regarding how the Bush administration treated Iraqi detainees.\n",
