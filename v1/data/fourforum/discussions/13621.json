   "I'm former journalist of Uzbek news agency HARAKAT. You could ask me - why former? And I say you that some time ago my editor-in-chief offered me to write a flattering opus about \"beneficent China\". I refused to be dismissed immediately.\n So now I am jobless.... There are some things in this country one can't debate in open. Many politicians here are actually on CIA payroll. That's sure can't be inspiring. One more unpleasant discovery for was that China's intelligence's also feeding them up! \n As for local officials it's quite plain story with them. They care a sh-t about this country's future perspectives. For huge bribes they are ready make Uzbekistan absolutely under the Chinese rule. And Chinese are generous with this, bribes I mean. They are not set to launch war or smth of the sort to subdue tis country. They are going just to buy everybody and everything in here. No sweet for them make Uzbekistan part if China! \n Actually I am sure that independent status of Uzbekistan is issue of uprooting enormous corruption and establishing true democracy here.\n It may seem strange but I strongly hope that it's Washington in the first run who can really be helpful. I expect that Americans will get aware of the vital necessity to stop corruption and bribery taking in Uzbekistan. Depraving of local officials doesn't actually fit their plans here. Why? In bribe giving USA has no chance to surpass China which seems to have much more money than Washington.",
