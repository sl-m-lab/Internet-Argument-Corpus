   "WASHINGTON - Scientists hate God. Or find God very disturbing. In fact, modern science has found no evidence of God, and so it's stupid to think God exists.\n \n The above statements are often presented as conventional wisdom, but are they true?\n \n A new collection of short essays, discussed here Thursday at an event at the American Enterprise Institute, responds to that question with a more diverse set of voices than is usually offered.\n \n Edited by Skeptic magazine publisher Michael Shermer and backed by the John Templeton Foundation, the booklet features replies by 13 scholars and thinkers to the question \"Does science make belief in God obsolete?\"\n \n The practical answer is, \"Of course not.\" Many people worldwide believe.\n \n In the United States, the percentage of the population without a religious affiliation is increasing, but the majority still have one, according to American Religious Identification Survey 2001.\n \n The faithful aren't going away despite a golden age of scientific descriptions of the mysteries of life and the secularizing, culture-draining force of consumerism.\n \n The answers offered by the booklet's two theologians, eight scientists, two cultural commentators and one philosopher are more creative and sophisticated than the mind-numbing \"culture wars\" portrayed on television.\n \n Some of the thinkers even found ways to synthesize or reconcile God and science without throwing up their hands.\n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,356376,00.html\n Okay.\n FOX NEWS even admits it.\n \n NOW can you guys finally get this through your heads? \n :xbanghead",

   "Science makes some religious interpretations obsolete.\n\n I agree. Science will never be able to disprove the supernatural in general. However, its findings address many of the cherished beliefs of most current mainstream religions. The two that I would view as the most important differences lie in the scientific vs religious views of:\n \n 1. Development of humans - where the evidence of Evolution seems to disprove most of the specific theological beliefs of creation (as has been discussed so fully in this forum).\n \n 2. The existence of the soul and the afterlife - where science has attributed so much of our mental existence to the functioning of the brain. Though the scientific understanding of our mental function is as yet incomplete, there is no scientific evidence yet that points to any supernatural existence.\n \n In my view, those are the two main cherished religious beliefs that scientific evidence can directly address. If religious institutions were to ever give up on those two beliefs and admit science is right, then much of what appeals to people about religion would be lost and the existence of religion would be in jeopardy.

You must prove that the big bang is actually real and based on more than your predictions which are based only on conceivable variables. What about the inconceivable variables that may have existed that scientists never ever even dreamt existed in reality?\n\n This line of argument crops up again and again: the denial that there can be such a thing as a weight of evidence favouring one hypothesis over another. It has to be all or nothing; either one explanation is absolutely proved or all explanations are equally likely.\n \n It's interesting because outside of this one issue, nobody thinks like that. If you get dealt pocket aces, you bet more readily than if you're dealt 2/7 offsuit - just because aces don't guarantee you'll win doesn't mean you're equally likely to win with 2/7. Hardly anyone has a problem understanding that - although if you do, you're welcome at my table any day. Similarly, if someone tosses a coin a hundred times and it comes up heads every single time, you instinctively know there's something fishy going on - the mere fact you don't know what it is and can't prove it's happening doesn't stop you: the outcome itself is evidence enough.\n \n With absolute certainty so hard to come by, we must often rely on an appreciation that we are more likely to be right if we believe this rather than that. I'm more likely to be right if I believe the coin toss was rigged than if I believe it was unbiased. I can even do the maths and work out exactly how much more likely - in that particular case I would confidently stake the lives of everyone on earth on it.\n \n So there's a generous helping of hypocrisy in this demand for absolute proof. Not because you don't hold the bible to the same standard - after all, you're not trying to prove the contents of the bible true, merely to drag science down to its level. It's hypocritical because you wouldn't in a million years let someone else use the same argument in a context, such as the simple examples above, where you appreciated the weight of evidence favouring one interpretation over another. \n \n By refusing to assimilate the evidence presented to you, tossing each nugget aside because it isn't in itself 'absolute proof' rather than letting it accumulate with an open mind, you maintain an ignorance that allows you to continue to pretend your beliefs about the natural history of earth are equally likely to be true.\n \n The second part of the argument, regarding 'inconceivable variables', is also interesting. Clearly, 'inconceivable variables' could admit literally any explanation of the history of earth, including the flying spaghetti monster and the Great Green Arkleseizure; it in no way favours biblical creation. But again, that's not the objective: rather the goal is to portray science as no better than the Flying Spaghetti Monster or the words of Genesis.\n \n Again, though, we cannot express the argument without the sour taste of hypocrisy filling our mouths. I'm sure you, AA, would not for a moment agree that the FSM or the GGA are on equal footing with biblical creation, and when asked why, you would naturally attempt to present evidence. So suddenly, evidence does count; some permutations of 'inconceivable variables' are absurd while others are not. As soon as your own beliefs are compared with ones even more spurious and contrived, you drop the egalitarian facade and haul out exactly the same weight-of-evidence toolkit that science uses to establish the far greater credibility of its results.\n \nAnd what about geological dating methods? All of your assumptions and conclusions regarding the age of everything depends on those conclusions being based in fact and absolutely accurate.\n\n Not absolutely accurate: as accurate as we calculate them to be.\n \nBy your own admission, you accept that you can neither confirm nor prove absolutely that new info wont come to light that completely nullifies what you assume to be true today regarding the age of the Earth or the Universe.\n\n Correct - although we can make statements of confidence about how terribly unlikely that is. But again, hypocrisy seems the order of the day: new information has come to light that completely nullifies what you assume to be true regarding the age of the earth and the universe - and you ignore it. \n \n All science does is take the best information available at any given time, and from it tries to construct useful and accurate models. If the models are useful and accurate, we judge that we've interpreted the information correctly, on the straightforward premise that if we were wrong we wouldn't get useful results. Discrepancies between the model and reality are a clue that the model is missing something - hence Newton was supplanted by Einstein: very accurate replaced by very very accurate. \n \nSo a more proper statement would be that science opposes and disagrees with religious interpretations but in no way makes religious interpretations obsolete at all.\n\n In some case yes, it does. After all, science didn't start out from a different model of reality than religion. The scientific method was applied to refine, correct and update what were initially dogmatic religious and philosophical statements about the world. Geocentrism was a philosophical statement, which rigorous testing overturned despite the efforts of philosophers to invoke 'inconceivable variables' (epicycles) to plug the gap between their model and reality. Special Creation is another philosophical statement about what should be true in order for humans to have their priviliged status, and rigorous testing has overturned that, too. Nobody's been locked up for it yet so far as I know, but there's still time :)\n \n Frankly I can't think of a better word than obsolete to describe an old hypothesis with none of the errors fixed. Even if the more refined and up-to-date hypothesis isn't perfect and never will be, it's still had a lot of bugs ironed out and will continue to improve over time.",

   "So there's a generous helping of hypocrisy in this demand for absolute proof. Not because you don't hold the bible to the same standard - after all, you're not trying to prove the contents of the bible true, merely to drag science down to its level. It's hypocritical because you wouldn't in a million years let someone else use the same argument in a context, such as the simple examples above, where you appreciated the weight of evidence favouring one interpretation over another. [snip]\n \n By refusing to assimilate the evidence presented to you, tossing each nugget aside because it isn't in itself 'absolute proof' rather than letting it accumulate with an open mind, you maintain an ignorance that allows you to continue to pretend your beliefs about the natural history of earth are equally likely to be true.\n \n The second part of the argument, regarding 'inconceivable variables', is also interesting. Clearly, 'inconceivable variables' could admit literally any explanation of the history of earth, including the flying spaghetti monster and the Great Green Arkleseizure; it in no way favours biblical creation. But again, that's not the objective: rather the goal is to portray science as no better than the Flying Spaghetti Monster or the words of Genesis.\n \n\n \n Not at all Peeling. There's nothing hypocritical about demanding the same level of evidence from scientists regarding scientific evidence that you demand for theological evidence. You are so quick to dismiss the bible as myth because you readily accept what science claims, but you refuse to accept that there could be untold numbers of unknown variables that make every single conclusion and scientific assumption you take for granted as wrong, flawed and as incorrect as incorrect can be.\n \n Here are 10 problems with the big bang theory, and these obviously aren't even unknown variables as we can list them to discuss them. But we can't answer them or categorize them sufficiently to put them to bed as non issues in any way. How can you accept the big bang as anything more than wishful thinking with the 3 links below that reveal so many known problems with the science? \n \n In what other scientific field would the community even consider a belief viable when so many contradictions exist that conflict with the known predictions they rely on to state that this so called theory is a fact in spite of the unknowns? What I'm asking is, if the science for the internal combustion engine never led to a working engine, and this many known problems existed that couldn't be answered or fixed by anyone; and this didn't even deal with the unknown problems we knew existed but couldn't see yet, would they still be working on an internal combustion engine? Or would they be looking at different technologies for propulsion that first worked in theory and could mechanically be constructed?\n Top Ten Problems with the Big Bang\n \n Tom Van Flandern, Meta Research\n \n A short list of the leading problems faced by the big bang in its struggle for viability as a theory:\n \n Static universe models fit the data better than expanding universe models.\n \n The microwave \"background\" makes more sense as the limiting temperature of space heated by starlight than as the remnant of a fireball.\n \n Element abundance predictions using the big bang require too many adjustable parameters to make them work.\n \n The universe has too much large scale structure (interspersed \"walls\" and voids) to form in a time as short as 10-20 billion years.\n \n The average luminosity of quasars must decrease with time in just the right way so that their mean apparent brightness is the same at all redshifts, which is exceedingly unlikely.\n \n The ages of globular clusters appear older than the universe.\n \n The local streaming motions of galaxies are too high for a finite universe that is supposed to be everywhere uniform.\n \n Invisible dark matter of an unknown but non-baryonic nature must be the dominant ingredient of the entire universe.\n \n The most distant galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field show insufficient evidence of evolution, with some of them apparently having higher redshifts (z = 6-7) than the faintest quasars.\n \n If the open universe we see today is extrapolated back near the beginning, the ratio of the actual density of matter in the universe to the critical density must differ from unity by just a part in 1059. Any larger deviation would result in a universe already collapsed on itself or already dissipated. http://www.metaresearch.org/cosmology/top10BBproblems.asp\n \n Top 30 problems with big bang: http://www.metaresearch.org/cosmology/BB-top-30.asp\n \n The monopole problem: http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/cosmology/bbproblems.html\n \n Now add to these numerous problems, the completely unknown variables that we don't even know about to ask, and for all we know in actuality, the Universe could be as young as only 25 thousand years old. And you can't guarantee me at all with any absolute assurance, that the unknown variables that exist, in addition to the known variables that we can't answer, that the big bang even happened absolutely. A completely unique and different type of event could have occurred leading to the creation of all that is in Time and Space. Like God spoke it into existence, for example. emoticon_xangel Who's to say what the resulting evidence of that event would look like to us? You can't answer that simple question can you? Then why do you assume He couldn't be the sole cause for the event?\n \n The big bang is a theory based on predictions after all and nothing more concrete than that once you admit that none of what you claim regarding it is absolutely factually proven, but based on assumptions which are derived from conclusions resulting from interpretations from other scientific studies in cosmology that told us that to consider that an original event called the big bang was a rational possibility. I will deal with the problems with geological dating next, but let's just stick with this problem right now. \n \n Regarding your assertion that I am attempting to bring evolutionary science DOWN to the level of Genesis Creation Account? Nothing could be further from the truth because I believe Genesis is the absolute truth even though, like your unprovable theories, it can't be absolutely proven either based on what we can observe with our human eyes. But I am here to tell you that when observing the World through a spiritual perspective, the truth of Gods word is self evident and rational on all levels of believability and acceptability. \n \n Your comparisons of my beliefs to the atheist created spaghetti monster is as ignorant, closed minded and insulting a label for my beliefs that you claim my understanding of your science is. And actually more insulting as I am going to be proven right one day, and you are attacking the living God whom you will one day face with your superior and elitist opinions of Him.

There's nothing hypocritical about demanding the same level of evidence from scientists regarding scientific evidence that you demand for theological evidence.\n\n The level of evidence for scientific conclusions - even the most tentative ones - is overwhelmingly greater than that for any theological pronouncement you care to name. But as I stated and explained at length, it wasn't that discrepancy I was highlighting.\n \nHere are 10 problems with the big bang theory,\n\n I will address these in another thread rather than further derail this one. I have the rebuttal page to hand. Entertainingly enough, it's from a Christian website.\n \nNow add to these numerous problems, the completely unknown variables that we don't even know about to ask, and for all we know in actuality, the Universe could be as young as only 25 thousand years old.\n\n This is the second point I made earlier. Rhetorical question: why do you think we should we give the existence of 'unknown variables' that make you right more credence than the existence of 'unknown variables' that make the Flying Spaghetti Monster or the Great Green Arkleseizure right? Your answer: something to do with evidence, yes? Something tangible that seperates your beliefs from the FSM and GGA, yes?\n \n So when it suits you, you're quite prepared to trot out evidence as if it means something, when your whole argument for dismissing the vastly greater body of evidence supporting scientific conclusions is that unknown variables might exist that render all evidence meaningless.\n \n Again, that's hypocrisy.\n \nA completely unique and different type of event could have occurred leading to the creation of all that is in Time and Space.

Whereas a universe that did come from a big bang would have to look like it came from one. Thus it is the most economical and likely explanation.\n \nRegarding your assertion that I am attempting to bring evolutionary science DOWN to the level of Genesis Creation Account?

Again you try to drag scientific conclusions down to the level of faith by denying the very principle of weight of evidence employed in the legal system and by you in your day-to-day life. Genesis cannot be absolutely proven and there is absolutely no evidence to support it. An evolutionary history of life cannot be absolutely proven but so much evidence supports it that the odds against it being true are beyond astronomical.\n \n There is no equivalence here, AA; you are only fooling yourself.\n \nYour comparisons of my beliefs to the atheist created spaghetti monster is as ignorant, closed minded and insulting a label for my beliefs that you claim my understanding of your science is.\n\n I merely pointed out that in order to differentiate your beliefs from them you would call upon evidence - which is hypocritical given that you disposed of the scientific method by tossing out evidence in favour of 'unknown variables'.\n \n \nAnd actually more insulting as I am going to be proven right one day, and you are attacking the living God whom you will one day face with your superior and elitist opinions of Him.

Perhaps the bible is the work of satan, a huge confidence trick to get you merrily shepherding souls into hell. Once you invoke the idea that evidence is meaningless to dispose of inconvenient scientific results, your own beliefs are equally fair game and you may as well pray to the FSM.\n \n On the other hand, I'm perfectly happy to endorse your vision, as put forth here, of literal creationism, as something that at best is a flight of fancy, made tolerable only by purposefully ignoring all the evidence.",

Sorry!\n \n The only requirement for something to be 'natural' is that it not be capricious. If reanimation of corpses was the norm, or even a statistical probability, we could investigate the causes, determine what variables made it more or less likely - in short, construct a theoretical model of whatever granularity the data made possible.\n \n The reason miracles fall outside the scope of nature and thus science is that we could perfectly recreate the circumstances leading up to a miracle and still not see it recur. The very fact we're trying could prejudice our efforts - the same argument offered to explain why tests of the efficacy of prayer invariably show no effect: the phenomenon allegedly hides from our efforts to test it.\n \n With me so far? Ok. The point, then, is that there's nothing in science that forbids miracles; it's just that the scientific methodology cannot be applied to them. The only relevant statement science would make is that if a phenomenon can be explained in terms of the known, that's probably the best interpretation, as opposed to inventing new forces at work. Science would discard the hypothesis that your pen is not subject to the force of gravity but rather is made to behave as if it was by the force of your mind, even though no absolute proof is possible.\n \n In terms of biblical miracles, a scientist would note that there is nothing described therin which must be true, nothing miraculous for which independent corroboration exists. He might further note that for the bible to be true, any number of equally earnest and explicit holy texts must perforce be works of imaginative fiction. So we find ourselves in the position that regardless of whether biblical miracles are true or not, it must be the case that earnest and explicit holy texts can be works of fiction. At which point, we are justified in choosing the simpler explanation of the two.\n \nNo, if anything, I think your view is more in line with what a lot of religious people would say.

Of course there are questions that need answering. Of course the big bang theory isn't complete. We're finally seeing independent corroborations of the existence of dark matter, for instance (the list you cut'n'paste is eleven years out of date in a fast-moving field of research), so there are indications that theory (rather than competing modified force theories) is on the right track, but it's still early days. The 'little bangs' theory of galaxy formation has recently taken a knock because observations are still consistent with a single big bang. Inflation theory is controversial in many circles. And on it goes.\n \n The salient point is not that we have questions to answer, but that the theory and its many confirmed predictions have allowed us to shape those questions, to make sure they're questions that genuinely need answering. I've tried to get this concept across to you before without success: when a theory allows us to ask lots of new questions, confident that they're the right kind of questions to be asking, that's an increase in knowledge, not a decrease.

   "With me so far? Ok. The point, then, is that there's nothing in science that forbids miracles; it's just that the scientific methodology cannot be applied to them. The only relevant statement science would make is that if a phenomenon can be explained in terms of the known, that's probably the best interpretation, as opposed to inventing new forces at work. Science would discard the hypothesis that your pen is not subject to the force of gravity but rather is made to behave as if it was by the force of your mind, even though no absolute proof is possible.\n\n \n Ok, I have no disagreement there.\n \n \nIn terms of biblical miracles, a scientist would note that there is nothing described therin which must be true, nothing miraculous for which independent corroboration exists. He might further note that for the bible to be true, any number of equally earnest and explicit holy texts must perforce be works of imaginative fiction. So we find ourselves in the position that regardless of whether biblical miracles are true or not, it must be the case that earnest and explicit holy texts can be works of fiction. At which point, we are justified in choosing the simpler explanation of the two.\n\n \n In the sense that some of the texts are clearly to have a symbolic and teaching interpretation as opposed to a literal historical interpretation, sure. (e.g. the Genesis creation story.) But that's not really the same as calling it \"fiction\", IMO. It's more like saying it's a completely different genre altogether. I think the term \"fiction\" is never going to bode well with anyone who looks on Biblical texts as sacred in any way, even if they don't take a literal interpretation. That's because for them, the truth of the scriptures has nothing to do with whether or not events happened exactly as described in such cases. It's not really about whether or not the events were actual events in history. It's sort of like someone saying the truth of Jesus' parables were wrapped up in whether or not his story was an actual historical event. That completely misses the point of the parable; the truth of the parable has nothing to do with that. His story could have been referring to a real event or NOT, and it still wouldn't effect whether or not the parable was an example of Truth.\n \n My approach is that with sacred scriptures, disproof is required as opposed to proof. That's not the way science works, but then we're not really talking about science. We're talking about the Bible, which isn't about science at all. And since the truth of the creation passage isn't wrapped up in whether it took place historically, then if science disproves that it could have happened in a literal sense the way Genesis describes, then I believe there are deeper meanings intended. It's not that reading it as a science book is inaccurate (though it is); it's that it was never meant to be that way to begin with.\n \n \nQuite. I would confine myself here to the earlier point: the truth of the bible is irrelevant to any subsequent events and requires any number of similar hoaxes to be perpetrated - why should one more hoax be considered at all unlikely?\n\n \n Truth in the sense of events happening the way described? I'm not sure I follow you. I think there comes a point where the hoax theory becomes as much of a stretch as to say the events really did happen, or at least their perceptions were real. People would have had to lose their homes, families, suffer physical persecution, and multiple people from different geographic areas would have had to perpetuate the same lie for a hoax to have taken place. It would require, for instance, for Paul to have essentially lived a significant portion of his life flat out LYING. The same with numerous other writers in the New Testament, because many of their writings are written from personal perspectives. The hoax theory requires so many things to have fallen into perfect place for it to have worked out the way it did, that it becomes no less believable than the idea that those people really DID believe what they were writing.",

I can only presume it's because you don't ever want the words 'genesis isn't true' to pass your lips. That's a PR exercise of one kind or another: either you're trying to give the false impression that nothing's really changed, that genesis is still true in the same sense as it was always believed to be and no backstep has been taken (which is the kind of revisionism the slipperier breed of politician undertakes), or you want to make it possible for other people to continue to read something into your statement that isn't really there.\n \nTruth in the sense of events happening the way described?

Regardless, my earlier point stands: plenty of people would have had to live a lie or a delusion for other holy texts to be wrong, so you can't assert the truth of the bible on the basis that such behaviour is implausible. There's a cargo cult somewhere in the pacific where to this day, so far as I know, an old woman with a wire wrapped around her claims to be a radio for talking to the promised planes.

Unfortunately, that's one hypothesis I doubt will be tested any time soon ;)\n\n \n This complete second half of your response is hogwash regarding its accuracy in defining how reliable what you claim the evidence is for your theory. The current dating methods rely on consistent levels of decay which according to all the evidence is impossible to rely on. In addition, scientists pick and choose samples they use which corroborate, rather than conflict with their desired result. So of what value is evidence when you take a large sample and then disregard any that disagree with your desired outcome? Note the bolded below as an example of what I'm saying. And an excerpt of the larger problems from the link I posted.\n First I want to make a few comments about the geological time scale, then consider several methods in detail, and then discuss some other issues.\n \n The geological time scale, described in this book by Harland and others, is based on less than 800 dates obtained by various methods on rocks from different geological layers. These dates tend to agree with each other, but there are hundreds of thousands of other dates that have been measured and were not listed. Many of these other dates disagree with one another, so it is not clear what the significance of these 800 dates is.\n \n The great majority of the dates on which the geological time scale is based, are measured using one method, the potassium-argon (K-Ar) method. In order to explain the fact that older dates tend to be found deeper down (if this is true), we really only need to explain why this shouuld be true for K-Ar dating, and then we have explained much of the geological time scale.\n \n K-Ar dating is based on the decay of potassium 40 to argon 40. When lava is hot, argon escapes from it, so it starts out with potassium but no argon. Over time, potassium gradually decays to argon, and the rate at which this occurs can be measured in the laboratory. By measuring how much potassium and argon is in a rock, and knowing how fast potassium decays, one can compute how old the rock is. The more argon, the older the rock is. The more potassium, the younger the rock is, since a larger amount of potassium would produce argon faster.\n \n However, the reality is much more complicated than this. The argon does not always escape when the lava is hot. The potassium can be removed later on, invalidating the calculation. Also, rocks absorb argon very easily from the environment. In fact, geologists have to take considerable precautions to get rid of the argon that accumulates on their lab equipment so that they can accurately measure K-Ar ages. Rocks can absorb a considerable amount of argon in this way, so all of the argon in a rock did not necessarily come from the potassium it contains. Atmospheric argon absorbed in this way can be corrected for, because it has a certain amount of argon 36 which can be measured. However, argon also comes up from the interior of the earth, and this argon has very little argon 36 in it, and cannot be detected. So we can explain the old K-Ar dates just by the fact that rocks absorb so much argon that comes up from the interior of the earth. Older rocks would have more time to absorb argon, and there was probably more argon coming through the earth at the time of the Flood and shortly thereafter than there is today. In fact, a number of geologists themselves now say that K-Ar dating is not very reliable, or mainly of historical importance. This is quite an admission, since most of the geological time scale is based on K-Ar dating.\n \n Another problem with K-Ar dating is that many volcanoes that we know erupted in the past several hundred years give K-Ar dates in the hundreds of thousands or millions of years.\n \n A large number of K-Ar dates on which the geological time scale is based, are dates from a mineral called glaucony. However, many geologists say that this mineral is highly unreliable for dating. So here we have a large part of the geological time scale based on a mineral which geologists themselves say is highly unreliable.\n \n So I guess we'll have to discard K-Ar dating as a reliable dating method.\n \n Now let's consider another method that some textbooks say is reliable. This is the dating of zircons by uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating and some other related methods. Zircon is a gemstone, a mineral that can have a considerable amount of uranium in it. However, when zircons form, they exclude lead. Over time, uranium decays to lead. By measuring the amount of uranium and lead in a zircon and knowing the rate of decay, we can measure the age of the zircon. Lead is somewhat mobile, however, as is uranium, and so other methods have been devised that can date zircons even if some lead leaves the rock.\n \n The problem with this method is that zircons can include lead when they form, throwing off the date. They can also lose uranium. In addition, they can travel through lava without melting, so the date computed for a zircon may be measuring a much older event than the lava flow itself. Even geologists recognize that ages given by zircons are often much too old, even for them. Furthermore, a batch of zircons from the same place will often yield widely different ages.\n \n So I guess we'll have to discard zircons as a reliable dating method.\n \n The next candidate dating method is fission track dating. Some minerals contain uranium 238 which decays by fission. It splits in two, and the pieces fly apart through the mineral, creating fission tracks. These tracks can be made visible by etching with an acid solution, and then counted. By knowing how much uranium 238 there is in a rock and by counting the number of fission tracks, one can measure the age of the rock.\n \n There are a number of problems with this method, and even geologists have had intense disagreements about its reliability. The ages often do not agree with what geologists expect. One problem is that certain constants involved in this method are not known or are hard to estimate, so they are calibrated based on the \"known\" ages of other rocks. If these other \"known\" ages are in error, then fission track dates are in error by the same amount.\n \n Another problem is that fission tracks fade at high temperatures. So if there are too few tracks, the geologist can always say that most of them faded away. To get a fission track date, one has to know something about the temperature history of a rock.\n \n Another problem is that uranium 238 can be removed from a rock by water. If a sample loses 99 percent of its uranium, then the fission track date will be 100 times too old. In fact, if a rock loses only about 1/350 of its uranium each year, then in 4000 years only one part in one hundred thousand of the uranium will remain, meaning that the date can approach a hundred thousand times too old. Now, 1/350 of the uranium each year is not much, especially when you consider that water occurs practically everywhere in the earth below a few hundred feet, and rocks shallower than this also become wet due to rainfall filtering down through the soil.\n \n Another problem is knowing what is a fission track and what is just an imperfection in the rock. Geologists themselves suggest that imperfections are at times mistaken for fission tracks, and admit that fission tracks are not always easy to recognize. Textbooks have beautiful, clean pictures of fission tracks, but I doubt that these illustrations correspond to reality.\n \n Along this line, it is interesting to note that for every fission of uranium 238, there are over a million decays by a process called alpha decay, in which a helium nucleus is ejected from the nucleus of uranium. The alpha particle creates a long, thin trail of damage, and the former uranium nucleus recoils in the other direction, creating a short, wide track about one thousandth as long as a fission track. Not only this, but what's left of the uranium nucleus (having lost the helium nucleus) decays by thirteen more steps until it becomes lead, so there are over fourteen million other decays for every fission track. Over four million of these occur within a few days. All of these decays emit particles that damage the crystal structure. Some of these decays emit alpha particles, and some emit beta particles, which are energetic electrons. In addition, many millions of gamma rays are emitted, which are high-energy electromagnetic radiation like X rays, and also damage the crystal structure. Perhaps the damage created by all this radiation can be increased by chemical action and be etched by acid to appear like fission tracks. Or if two alpha particle trails are close enough together, perhaps they can damage the crystal enough so that their combined trail will be etched away by acid like a fission track.\n \n Minerals are also subject to alteration by water, which may contain chemicals that react with the rock. Over long periods of time, all of these processes can damage the crystal structure, and it may be that when the mineral is etched with acid, track-like formations appear as a result.\n \n Another problem is that fission tracks in some minerals, like zircons, can survive in lava, so the fission track date can be measuring an older event than the lava flow. Thus we cannot necessarily use this method to date the age of the fossils.\n \n I think fission track dating has more potential than the other methods, but in view of all of these problems, I think we'll have to discard fission track dating as a reliable method.\n \n There are still other methods, such as rubidium-strontium dating, which are based on the decay of a parent substance (in this case rubidium) to its daughter product (strontium). These methods all depend on knowing how much daughter product was initially present, which we cannot know. So we'll have to discard rubidium-strontium dating and similar methods as reliable dating methods\n \n There is also the so-called \"isochron\" method, which is a clever way to estimate the amount of daughter product present initially, so that one can then use rubidium-strontium dating and other methods to get reliable dates. Unfortunately, isochrons can also be caused by mixing processes that have nothing to do with true dates. One study indicated that nearly all published isochrons have properties suggesting that they result from mixings, and thus are not giving true dates. Another study indicated that nearly all isochrons published have poor statistical quality. Geologists often make excuses to reject isochrons, anyway, when they don't like the dates.\n \n So I guess we'll have to discard the isochron method as a reliable dating method.\n \n The problem is that now there is nothing left! It's also interesting that geologists frequently admit that these different methods usually don't agree with one another. So the next time you see a museum exhhibit with a sign saying that some fossil is so many tens or hundreds of millions of years old, I hope you'll take that with a large grain of salt.\n \n If there is real evidence that these fossils are hundreds of millions of years old, then I want to know about it. But so far I haven't found it.\n \n Could it be that all the old K-Ar dates for fossil bearing layers of rock are due to argon added to the rock and not to the decay of potassium? Could it be that all the old zircon dates are due to inherited lead or inherited zircons, and not to decay of uranium over long time periods? Could it be that all the old fission track dates can be explained by the leaching of most of the uranium out of a rock, or by a mistaken calibration, or by radiation damage, and do not give a true age? Could it be that all of these fossil-bearing rocks are very young?\n \n From all the study I've done so far, nothing would exclude this possibility.\n \n In addition to the fact that these methods all have problems, there are additional problems with radiometric dating. For example, there may be choices of methods to use for dating a rock, and choices of which minerals to date, and geologists choose methods and rocks that give dates that tend to agree with one another. They may treat a rock with an acid, or purify it using a magnetic separator, to get the dates to agree. Then they use this agreement between methods as evidence that radiometric dating is correct.\n \n I've also been bewildered by contradictory statements by different geologists. One source says that low uranium zircons always give dates that agree with one another, while another source says that the amount of uranium has no effect on the fequency with which the dates agree. One source says that zircons have little inherited lead, and another source says that this is a common problem. One source says that historic lava flows rarely give old K-Ar ages, and another source says that they often do. Often I've tried to figure out how some evidence could be true, only later to find out that it's not so.\n http://www.cs.unc.edu/~plaisted/ce/deception.html",

   "This is an interesting, yet very inaccurate analogy regarding a comparison to the big bang theory, and here's why; the evidence for the dead man, as you said is sitting their in real time, on the floor right in front of you.\n\n As is the evidence for the big bang, so to speak.\n \n The relevance of the analogy lay in the concept of proof via the elimination of reasonable doubt, however that may be accomplished. It may be that unbiased eyewitness testimony eliminates reasonable doubt, or DNA evidence, or ballistics - however it is accomplished the elimination of reasonable doubt is deemed sufficient in law and is accepted as sufficient, by you, in all matters other than this one.\n \n If I had a betting system that predicted the results of races to the better part of a thousandth of a percent accuracy, you'd slap down your cash without a qualm. But let a scientist make a prediction and have it confirmed to the same or greater level of accuracy, and suddenly the air is just packed with unknowable variables that mean his accurate prediction is nothing more than a coincidence.\n \nThis complete second half of your response is hogwash regarding its accuracy in defining how reliable what you claim the evidence is for your theory. The current dating methods rely on consistent levels of decay\n\n Actually, several of them don't rely on any isotopic decay at all. \n \nwhich according to all the evidence is impossible to rely on.\n\n Again, your pure speculation hits the brick wall of consillience. If the rates varied in the past, why do the dates agree with each other? It's not enough for them to have varied equally in the past, because different half-lives are involved. And then there's the fact that if they had at any point been high enough to compress millions and billions of years of decay into a few thousand years, the earth would at this moment be a molten ball of slag. I'd say the fact it isn't is a point in my favour, yes?\n \nIn addition, scientists pick and choose samples they use which corroborate, rather than conflict with their desired result.\n\n Oh lord, not this rubbish again. Can I just refer you back to the exhaustive rebuttal I posted in our recent one-on-one? \n \n Rather than pander to your attempts to derail the thread, I'll just post links to rebuttal pages for people to read at their leisure.\n Plaisted rebutted Part 1.\n Plaisted rebutted Part 2\n Yet more spurious criticisms rebutted.\n Christian perspective on radiometric dating.\n Treatment of many YEC claims. Note the graph at the top - which only uses creationist 'cherry picked' bad radiometric dates and still yields a good curve.\n \n As a little taster of just how spurious his arguments are, I'll deal with this bit myself:\n \nThe geological time scale, described in this book by Harland and others, is based on less than 800 dates obtained by various methods on rocks from different geological layers. These dates tend to agree with each other, but there are hundreds of thousands of other dates that have been measured and were not listed. Many of these other dates disagree with one another, so it is not clear what the significance of these 800 dates is.\n\n Note that he implies these hundreds of thousands of other dates don't agree with the 800 that happen to be mentioned in the book, without actually saying so - because of course it isn't true. He says 'many' disagree with each other - how many? And by how much? If it were 90%, or 50%, or even 20% don't you think he would quote the figure?\n \n There's plenty more, like the way he talks about potassium leaching from rocks to yield bad ages - when the rocks susceptible to such leaching are not used in dating for precisely that reason. Or how he talks vaguely about a recent eruption yielding hundred-million year old dates - and then inadvertantly explains why lower down (xenoliths; foreign rock that didn't melt during the eruption), only phrased as a different 'problem' with dating methods.\n \n I think the analogy I recall using in our one-on-one sums it up best: if I were to describe in excruciating detail all the things that could go wrong on my daily commute - mechanical failure of each individual bit of the car, accidents at every conceivable step of the way - I would have little difficulty painting a picture of an impossible, Herculean task, especially to someone as unfamiliar with cars or driving as you are with geochronology. Yet by maintaning my car properly and paying attention while behind the wheel, I manage to surmount all those obstacles on a daily basis. Thus it is with dating methods. Yes, you have to be careful. Yes, you need to be sure you have a proper explanation for the date you get, whether it's expected (as it is usually) or anomalous (as it is relatively rarely). Yes, you need to employ as many independent methods as possible. All these caveats can, however, be overcome. \n \n At the end of the day, even if YEC criticisms were valid, they would amount to no more than a few percentage points difference to the established ages. No amount of twisting the results can bring them in line with a biblical chronology - the fact the earth's crust isn't incandescent is proof of that all on its own. So with no reason to even suspect such could be the case, what argument is there for not taking the results at face value?",

I can only presume it's because you don't ever want the words 'genesis isn't true' to pass your lips. That's a PR exercise of one kind or another: either you're trying to give the false impression that nothing's really changed, that genesis is still true in the same sense as it was always believed to be and no backstep has been taken (which is the kind of revisionism the slipperier breed of politician undertakes), or you want to make it possible for other people to continue to read something into your statement that isn't really there.\n\n \n I have no problem saying \"Genesis isn't true\", from the standpoint of ONLY referring to 'truth' in the sense of pertaining to the way actual events of how creation took place. But when you start throwing around a term like \"truth\" with religious people, you're getting into a whole lot more than that. In terms of scientific facts, sure Genesis isn't true. Any more than, say, the parables of Jesus aren't true (from the standpoint that they probably aren't referring to actual events, but are stories to teach people something).\n \n You are correct that in the past the creation account in Genesis was used in place of science, because it was all there was. It was all people had to go on. That's not unreasonable in the absence of better facts. Where it gets unreasonable is when people continue to make it the point of the passage in face of better facts. It's not that better facts disprove the passage (though they do in the sense of the facts presented), it's that they show the passage has other purposes. Truth is wrapped up in other aspects of the passage, rather than just whether or not it's scientifically factual or not. In a sense, whether or not it is scientifically factual is perhaps the least important thing to consider about the Genesis account.\n \n Because of that, I'm going to use the term \"scientific fact\" rather than the term \"truth.\" Religious people view truth as much deeper and more profound than merely scientific fact.\n \n \nIf I recall correctly, many of them were presented from a personal perspective but were in fact communal works. Regardless, my earlier point stands: plenty of people would have had to live a lie or a delusion for other holy texts to be wrong, so you can't assert the truth of the bible on the basis that such behaviour is implausible. There's a cargo cult somewhere in the pacific where to this day, so far as I know, an old woman with a wire wrapped around her claims to be a radio for talking to the promised planes. I hope for the sake of consistency that until we disprove that claim, you're happy to accept it as true :)\n\n \n If the adherents of that religious group are happy and content with that life, then I'm not going to presume to tell them they shouldn't accept that as scientific fact OR religious truth.\n \n \nHardly perfect place; inconsistencies in the text are proof enough of that. The new testament was compiled and subject to who knows what editing decades after the fact; all we've got to go on are the selected parts that passed muster - much like the Qur'an.\n\n \n But that is an example of speculation as well. We'll never know for certain if it was edited later, or more importantly if the 'miracle passages' are examples of editing. And the fact it was written decades after the events in question is completely irrelevant. Unless you're ready to write off any history book that's ever been written more than 10 years after the events described.",

   "I have no problem with people in any given religion taking that approach to their scriptures. The issue here, as I see it, is that skeptics don't want Christians to take the Bible as truth. After all, that is the group we so most often targeted here with arguments of skepticism or criticism over this.\n\n One unfortunate consequence of the creationism/ID offensive. Certainly I had no pressing urge to speak out before I became aware of it.\n \n Still, consistency here does not simply mean allowing others to apply that thinking to their own scriptures. It means you applying the same thinking to other holy texts. I'm not saying that belief in one god entails a belief in all gods; you can of course choose to believe what you like. But it's better to be honest about the fact it is a choice, and that the contributing factors are appeal, familiarity, respect for likeminded peers, moral compatability and so forth rather than an underlying rational imperative.\n \nI have no problem saying \"Genesis isn't true\", from the standpoint of ONLY referring to 'truth' in the sense of pertaining to the way actual events of how creation took place.

You don't think that I think you're a fundy, do you?\n\n \n No, I don't think you think that. \n \n \nWhere did I argue for a \"tit-for-tat\" or \"equal time\" approach? This part of my response had nothing to do with schools: It is asinine for somebody to complain about an atheist speaking about against what he/she thinks about irrationality of theism when theists have, do and will continue to slander atheists the way they do. You seem to think that the atheist line is merely a response, but that's silly, too: Dawkins would be able to make his points regardless of what slander overzealous religious wackos have publicized. Why the hell would atheists be expected to shut the hell up (lest we be matching condemnation with condemnation) because theists are being jackasses? In case that's not clear, it's like you're saying that because theists are slandering us, we should sit and take it. Wouldn't you say the same if those theists weren't being jackasses?\n\n \n It's not the fact you don't sit down and take it. It's the nature of the counter arguments. If the response were simply, 'no you're wrong, I don't believe in God' it would be totally different. On one hand theists say their view comprises nothing more than a lack of belief. Nothing more. But then some of them argue religiously against religion, and clearly aren't content with nothing more than a 'lack of belief'. There's an pro-active aggressive nature to what they're doing. They've gone past merely non-belief to something more. Going after religion by calling it a delusion is not an example of refusing to 'sit down and take' slander. It's attacking religion.",

It's attacking religion.\n\n Damn right it's an attack on religion. What I don't understand is why you seem to want an embargo on religion-attacking, as if religion is off-limits or the endangered species of belief systems. It's as if you're objecting to refusing to \"sit down and take it\" while at the same time acknowledging that we don't have to sit down and take it. \"Go ahead and do x, but -- whatever you do -- don't do x.\" (I find this especially ironic considering the discussion regarding teachers above.)\n Declaring that luminiferous aether doesn't exist or that belief in it is foolishly unfounded is attacking aether theory, but nobody seems to have much of a problem with that. The fact is that there are lines of reasoning and evidence for the rejection of aether theory. Dawkins argues that there are lines of reasoning and evidence to reject many religions and specific conceptualizations of deities. And unlike with aether theory, religion has major effects, many of which are reprehensible. My advice would be to stop adhering to something so worthy of attack; if somebody can't see the problem with such an adherence, I'm not sure I can help them anyway\n I'll agree that there is some unfair lumping of more reasonable religious persons with the ones who typify the examples of fanaticism and delusion. But on major points, there's plenty of overlap. The rationale is not there. People make a leap, and whether they acknowledge it or not, they are skewing from what they know works into something that they know is unreliable; it's special pleading that gets a free pass for the shoddy reason of \"hey, it's religion, so it's okay.\" I reject that reasoning precisely because it is devoid of any.",

I'm on the liberal side of the political fence; does the fact that I'm not praising the Dems and railing against Republicans while doing my job make me two-faced?\n\n \n Would you force teachers to remove all photos from the desk of their children in their family? How sterile do you really want to make it for teachers? Goodness, we already don't pay them enough in so many cases. Let them be themselves as a rule, rather than as the exception.\n \n \nReligion is a personal issue; it is certainly not a professional issue, and state employees should treat it as a personal and not a professional issue.\n\n \n And THAT'S the problem. Who says it's a personal issue? Usually people who don't like religion; that's who. People who are intolerant about it. What if someone says atheism as a mindset should be a personal issue? We've gotten into a stupid culture in this country (and in Europe even more so) that freaks out over religion or such related views being made public. Yet it's a normal part of life to have views. People really need to chill out. I agree it's not a professional issue, but neither is letting a teacher put a framed family picture on their desk. It may not be a professional issue, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't feel free to talk about it if they want. We're too paranoid about it.\n \n \nIt is, but a state institution has more interesting nuances. No endorsement. Period. Therefore, rulings have said that a teacher's discussion of religion needs to be disjointed from teaching the subject matter. This in no way restricts the teacher's ability to practice his or her religion in a non-imposing way, which is the right that is protected.\n\n \n You and I both know that's unreasonable. A teacher doesn't just throw a switch between talking about academics and taking about other things. They try, but in the real world they are an influence on their students all the time and there's nothing anyone can do about that. If my kids were going to school and I found out the teacher was a Muslim, I wouldn't impose on the teacher to be someone they aren't for 6 hours or whatever out of the day. That's who they are. You can't expect people to just turn that off. Or at least we shouldn't. The same would apply if I found out my kids had an atheist teacher. \n \n \n\"No, you're wrong; I don't believe in God\" would be an answer to only one assertion I can think of, which is that atheists really aren't atheists but are trying to be rebellious. Personally, I think that argument -- to which you know a simple denial would not be accepted at face value by the person making the claim anyway -- is stupid on so many levels that it is deserving of some unabashed bashing.\n\n \n So you think calling someone delusional, bad, or mentally ill is a better way? If so, you might as well be insulting the funeral urn on the mantle. Religion is a sacred and dear matter for people, not just an academic one, and that's the biggest problem I have with neoatheism. When people belittle it or berate religion (even if that's really the way they really feel), it demonstrates a lack of sensitivity. If you wouldn't go up to a grieving widow at a funeral and say \"your idea of a spiritual attachment and love to your dead husband is delusional\", then there's no reason you should say that about religious people either. If you wouldn't go into a home and say to someone that it's delusional to keep their mother's funeral urn on the mantle, then there's no reason to tell people their religion is delusional either. You may really think that the grieving widow is delusional (I don't know), but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to express. It's a matter of respect in society, and tolerance.\n \n We also see that lack of respect coming into the debate over evolution. I've seen far worse things said about ID'ers than I have by ID'ers about those who argue for evolution.\n \n \nIn the strictest sense, that is true of the religious beliefs. There are, however, logical and philosophical arguments that also apply. You don't expect atheists to have no beliefs about anything, so why do your arguments imply such?\n\n \n When it comes to THEISM, they shouldn't have any beliefs--they refer to themselves as atheists, after all. I guess what perplexes me is that their belief or lack thereof of neoatheists becomes the least of what they're identifiable as: they're more identifiable for intolerance of religion than they are for any lack of belief. \n \n \nTrue: In many cases, I call it \"self defense.\" If some dipstick wants to make dumbass arguments that I'm a terrible person, a fool destined to burn in hell, I'll rip him/her a new one. Those people bring it upon themselves. See also below.\n\n \n Oh give me a break. We're way past the point where this stuff is just self-defense. No one's going to make you or anyone else abandon being an atheist. You are free to not believe whatever you don't want to believe. It's silly to think you are in danger. Why would you respond to someone who says you're going to burn in hell by saying ALL religion is bad or that religious people are mentally ill? (Again, that's the stuff we see sometimes. I'm not singling you out personally here.) Why would you call that which gave hope to slaves and provided churches out of which the civil rights movement came to be delusional? Why would you call William Wilberforce delusional? That's the thing--when you call religion delusional and/or bad, you're calling it ALL such. You're damning the good, too.\n \n \nDamn right it's an attack on religion. What I don't understand is why you seem to want an embargo on religion-attacking, as if religion is off-limits or the endangered species of belief systems. It's as if you're objecting to refusing to \"sit down and take it\" while at the same time acknowledging that we don't have to sit down and take it. \"Go ahead and do x, but -- whatever you do -- don't do x.\" (I find this especially ironic considering the discussion regarding teachers above.)\n\n \n Because they're not taking a measured and specific approach, but rather a all--or-nothing approach. Where religion needs criticising, by all means, criticise it. But don't just assert or imply people are stupid for being religious. Religion isn't going to go away, so you might as well learn to live with it. This is about an intolerance among atheists, not just merely criticising where criticism is due. \n \n \nI'll agree that there is some unfair lumping of more reasonable religious persons with the ones who typify the examples of fanaticism and delusion. But on major points, there's plenty of overlap. The rationale is not there. People make a leap, and whether they acknowledge it or not, they are skewing from what they know works into something that they know is unreliable; it's special pleading that gets a free pass for the shoddy reason of \"hey, it's religion, so it's okay.\" I reject that reasoning precisely because it is devoid of any.\n\n \n So would you criticize an eagle scout for having pride in receiving an award? How about when he helps an old lady across the street? (After all, all she needs to do is wait for the light to change, she got that far, she can get across and no one's going to run over an old lady.) Would you call it delusional to put stock in wedding vows? Or a more difficult analogy: how about a widower taking solace from the idea that he'll see his just deceased wife in heaven?\n \n There are many, many examples out there of belief and adherence that we DO take a \"hey, it's so-and-so, so it's okay.\" and that we can also say is devoid of 'reason', really. We SHOULD take the approach that it's ok UNTIL there's a reason not to. It's only when it is demonstrably and quantifiably harmful that we should oppose it, rather than doing so automatically as the rule and not the exception.",

   "No, that's not my view on that situation at all. What caused the harm wasn't that she prayed for her children. It was simply that they didn't take them to a doctor.\n\n Because she (they?) believed prayer would heal - in the same way Archangel repeatedly insists prayer can heal. It was a cornerstone of their faith. You're presuming to tell them they're wrong.\n \nThat's ALL that story should haver really ever been about. The fact she prayed isn't what was causing harm--people pray all the time without causing harm because they do it in the context of doctors being an active part of the medical care given. Prayer is a normal part of most peoples' life to varying degrees. Where this family failed was not letting doctors into the situation.\n\n Of course prayer can't do harm, and for a very simple reason. But we're not just talking about prayer, we're talking about faith and belief and its relationship with reason and rationality. It wasn't the latter, after all, that led them to believe prayer alone would work.\n \n Here are your words again:\n \nIf the adherents of that religious group are happy and content with that life, then I'm not going to presume to tell them they shouldn't accept that as scientific fact OR religious truth.\n\n This statement concerned a - so far as you know harmlessly - eccentric cargo cult. However, when someone prostrates themselves uselessly beside their dying child rather than taking them to the doctor, you don't say \"If the adherents of that religious group are happy and content with that life, then I'm not going to presume to tell them they shouldn't accept <the direct healing power of prayer< as scientific fact OR religious truth.\" Hell no, you presume the heck out of those nutters!\n \n The difference between these two scenarios is rationally obvious - but then that's precisely my point. Your permissive attitude toward the blurring of the line between fact and belief evaporates the moment someone steps over where you rationally know the 'danger' line to be. I take no particular pride in being able to draw this parallel, but at the end of the film 'How to lose a guy in ten days' the female lead's editor tells her she can write about whatever she likes - \"wherever the wind blows you.\" \"What, politics, current affairs...?\" \"Well, the wind isn't going to blow you there.\"\n \n You seem to want to advocate faith unrestrained, but you're only prepared to defend it when rationality stands guard over its greatest lunacies. That's either inconsistent, or something more complex: perhaps you think believers should be able to indulge the spirit-affirming illusion of faith being placed above reason while doing so within a secular framework that ensures rational concerns remain paramount. I don't yet know enough to decide which :)",

Who says it's a personal issue?\n\n I like Matthew 6:6.\n \n \nWhat if someone says atheism as a mindset should be a personal issue?\n\n Fine by me. I'll share with people who care to discuss it, but I won't push it in the faces of people who don't.\n \n \nWe've gotten into a stupid culture in this country (and in Europe even more so) that freaks out over religion or such related views being made public.\n\n \"being made public?\" Not at all. How many people go nuts when politicians say that they're religious? Precisely zero. It becomes an issue when people make it an issue in cases where it shouldn't be.\n \n \nI agree it's not a professional issue, but neither is letting a teacher put a framed family picture on their desk.\n\n And I argue that the two are not analogous.\n \n \nIt may not be a professional issue, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't feel free to talk about it if they want.\n\n I just told you that the courts have leaned toward approving discussing it appropriately. They haven't imposed a gag rule. This is a far cry from injecting religious points into lessons, which is prohibited.\n \n \nYou and I both know that's unreasonable. A teacher doesn't just throw a switch between talking about academics and taking about other things.\n\n I can and do. If I want to be all business, then I'm all business.\n But you entirely missed my point. Having teachers refrain from religious diatribe during instructional time is not an imposition on their free exercise any more than it is an imposition on their basketball hobby. (I'd argue that it's more of an imposition on a basketball hobby.)\n \n \nSo you think calling someone delusional, bad, or mentally ill is a better way?\n\n Not necessarily, but I sacrifice tact for truth in some cases. Can I make the case that it's true?\n If someone pushes, I'll push back. If your problem is with a lack of sensitivity, we'll have little in common. If you base your life on the premise that things fall up, why should I feed your delusion instead of trying to teach you?\n \n \nIf you wouldn't go into a home and say to someone that it's delusional to keep their mother's funeral urn on the mantle, then there's no reason to tell people their religion is delusional either.\n\n I don't chase down random people. When someone makes it an issue, then it becomes an issue. If a religious person makes a habit of expressing his/her religiosity, they've opened the door.\n \n \nWe also see that lack of respect coming into the debate over evolution. I've seen far worse things said about ID'ers than I have by ID'ers about those who argue for evolution.\n\n I hardly care. There is no debate over evolution (except of course for small details, nothing on the level that IDists/creationists claim). By pretending that there is, they declare open season on their ignorance.\n \n \n... [atheists are] more identifiable for intolerance of religion than they are for any lack of belief.\n\n There's a fine line between intolerance and standing up for rights. Where than line falls seems to be subjective. An atheist objecting to a violation of church-state separation gets branded an intolerant \"neoatheist\" activist. Schools have Fellowships of Christian Students/Athletes, but I'm confident that there'd be hell to pay if I wanted to start a voluntary freethinker group at school.\n \n \nOh give me a break. We're way past the point where this stuff is just self-defense.\n\n I specifically said some cases, and that's true. Stop pretending that I'm saying what I'm not.\n \n \nNo one's going to make you or anyone else abandon being an atheist.\n\n And restricting teachers from inserting religion into their instructional time won't make them or students abandon their religion.\n \n \nIt's silly to think you are in danger.\n\n But it's not silly to think that my rights are. Need I actually use examples, or will you concede this point?\n \n \nWhy would you respond to someone who says you're going to burn in hell by saying ALL religion is bad or that religious people are mentally ill?\n\n If it were true, why wouldn't I say it? (That said, I'm not saying that it is true.)\n \n \nWhy would you call that which gave hope to slaves and provided churches out of which the civil rights movement came to be delusional?\n\n If something is delusional, it's delusional regardless of its influence or effects.\n \n \nThat's the thing--when you call religion delusional and/or bad, you're calling it ALL such. You're damning the good, too.\n\n I disagree with your statement. I don't believe that your beliefs are true, but that in itself doesn't earn my contemptuous wrath. In fact, I recognize that your beliefs can have positive effects. But that's no reason for me to endorse your beliefs as excellent.\n \n \nBecause they're not taking a measured and specific approach, but rather a all--or-nothing approach. Where religion needs criticising, by all means, criticise it. But don't just assert or imply people are stupid for being religious.\n\n What if a strong case can be made for this being true? Who are you (or anyone else) to gag this line of argumentation.\n I'd like to distinguish between the assertion that religious beliefs are stupid and the assertion that religious people must be entirely stupid.\n \n \nReligion isn't going to go away, so you might as well learn to live with it.\n\n Religious oppression isn't going to go away either, so should we just sit and accept it? See, we've already had this conversation, and this doesn't help your point.\n \n \nThis is about an intolerance among atheists, not just merely criticising where criticism is due.\n\n But where criticism is due, as we have established, is not a clear line.\n \n \nSo would you criticize an eagle scout for having pride in receiving an award?\n\n How does this follow from what I said? Pride is deadly according to religion, not worthy of criticism according to me.\n \n \nWould you call it delusional to put stock in wedding vows?\n\n I call it delusional to think that they are anything more than standard promises because they happened to occur at a big ceremony or in a church. Perhaps there is a stronger will to obey them due to context, but I don't think there's any special religious influence.\n \n \nOr a more difficult analogy: how about a widower taking solace from the idea that he'll see his just deceased wife in heaven?\n\n Why is this more difficult? Use the same approach: is there sufficient evidence or reason to believe that this is true? I don't think so. That it has to do with a sensitive subject doesn't change the facts.\n \n \nThere are many, many examples out there of belief and adherence that we DO take a \"hey, it's so-and-so, so it's okay.\" and that we can also say is devoid of 'reason', really.

   "Because she (they?) believed prayer would heal - in the same way Archangel repeatedly insists prayer can heal. It was a cornerstone of their faith. You're presuming to tell them they're wrong.\n\n \n How is it that *I'm* telling them they're wrong?\n \n Why is it that one can't pray for their children AND take them to the doctor? I can't figure out for the life of me why some here who criticize prayer seem to have the idea that one completely means the other can't be done. I'm reminded of the old story of the guy on his roof in a flood where God sends a boat, a helicopter, etc. and he ignores all that saying he's praying for rescue. \n \n \nOf course prayer can't do harm, and for a very simple reason. But we're not just talking about prayer, we're talking about faith and belief and its relationship with reason and rationality. It wasn't the latter, after all, that led them to believe prayer alone would work.\n\n \n Their problem wasn't that they believe prayer would work. Their problem was that they didn't go to the doctor. People believe prayer will work and STILL go to doctors all the time. One need have nothing to do with the other, other than the doctor (medical care) potentially being the MEANS God might choose to answer the prayer and bring a cure. If some goes to the doctor and wouldn't any less, then it doesn't matter that they believe in prayer. It's irrelevant to the real issue--that people should go to doctors.\n \n \nThis statement concerned a - so far as you know harmlessly - eccentric cargo cult. However, when someone prostrates themselves uselessly beside their dying child rather than taking them to the doctor, you don't say \"If the adherents of that religious group are happy and content with that life, then I'm not going to presume to tell them they shouldn't accept <the direct healing power of prayer< as scientific fact OR religious truth.\" Hell no, you presume the heck out of those nutters!\n\n \n No, no. They SHOULD go to the doctor. That's not the same as the issue of whether they should or shouldn't pray if they want to. It's very simple really, and I think you're making this more complicated that it really should be. There's two distinct things that should be said here: 1) people should go to doctors. Most religious people do and have no problem with that. 2.) people should be free to feel they can pray if they want. I'd say 9 out of 10 cases (or more) consist of people who do both and it works fine. The cases like what you're talking about are cases where the failure is NOT in the fact they prayed, but that they didn't go to the doctor. You're assuming the failure in the fact they prayed, but the failure is that they didn't go to the doctor. It's not just an A OR B situation, but can be an A AND B situation. (We know this because people have both all the time, and it's in fact the normal way prayer-beliving people do things.) The proper response isn't to get rid of Item-A (prayer), it's to make sure people KEEP Item-B (going to the doctor). You taking the solution of negating something that doesn't need to be a preventative factor, when in fact the proper solution is to POSIT the factor that's being prevented. Do you understand now?\n \n Let's try another analogy. I'll even use one that indulges your view that prayer is useless and doesn't work. If someone doesn't eat any nutritious food because they eat candy and think the candy will do the job just as well because it tastes really good, is it the correct response to be focused on getting them to end all eating of candy? No, the REAL problem is that they aren't eating nutritious food. THAT'S where the solution lies--not in getting them to stop eating candy. The solution is for them to start eating nutritious foods. Giving up eating candy really isn't going to help any. It's not the proper response, nor is it necessary--as long as someone is getting proper nutrition it probably is not going to hurt them to eat some candy.\n \n \nThe difference between these two scenarios is rationally obvious - but then that's precisely my point. Your permissive attitude toward the blurring of the line between fact and belief evaporates the moment someone steps over where you rationally know the 'danger' line to be.\n\n \n This is no blurring of the line as long as people always go to the doctor when they need to. There's no need to argue people shouldn't pray. What you should be arguing is that they should always go to the doctor when they need to. \n \n \nYou seem to want to advocate faith unrestrained, but you're only prepared to defend it when rationality stands guard over its greatest lunacies. That's either inconsistent, or something more complex: perhaps you think believers should be able to indulge the spirit-affirming illusion of faith being placed above reason while doing so within a secular framework that ensures rational concerns remain paramount. I don't yet know enough to decide which :)\n\n \n This isn't a case of faith above reason or reason above faith. The simple reality is that the issue here is people should go to the doctor when they need to. They can still have faith just as much as they want because they can still pray as much as they want. In fact, if a pray-er doesn't go to the doctor, they're not taking advantage of a common way God might very well answer their prayers. They very well may be forsaking the rowboat God sends in the flood.",

   "Does the law call for separation of family and state?\n\n \n Well that's sort of the point. The law doesn't call for teachers to have to not be themselves if they are religious, either. Unfortunately our paranoia over religion has greatly influenced our opinions and interpretations of the first amendment, which if read for what it says, which doesn't forbid people to be religious even if working for a public entity. Furthermore, to invoke separation of church and state is to invoke the very amendment which also gives freedom of speech--therefore you're contradicting the amendment in the same moment you're invoking it in this case.\n \n \n\"being made public?\" Not at all. How many people go nuts when politicians say that they're religious? Precisely zero. It becomes an issue when people make it an issue in cases where it shouldn't be.\n\n \n Sure they do--people freak out all the time when politicians do so--for example, GWB's being religious has been a favorite subject of criticisms among his critics. It seems that \"where it shouldn't be\" is usually a matter of opinion, and often ends up being mainly the mantra of people who just don't like religion very much.\n \n \nI just told you that the courts have leaned toward approving discussing it appropriately. They haven't imposed a gag rule. This is a far cry from injecting religious points into lessons, which is prohibited.\n\n \n But you've already made clear you don't just limit your opinion that religion shouldn't be shared to cases of 'injecting it into lessons.'\n \n \n \nI can and do. If I want to be all business, then I'm all business. But you entirely missed my point. Having teachers refrain from religious diatribe during instructional time is not an imposition on their free exercise any more than it is an imposition on their basketball hobby. (I'd argue that it's more of an imposition on a basketball hobby.)\n\n \n I suspect the line is blurred in the thinking of your students more than you may realise. Kids are often looking for a role-model, and your values likely come through more than you may know. In my opinion that's not a bad thing. Kids are going to do that and we shouldn't just try to sterilize their environment of all-things-moralistic or religious. \n \n \nNot necessarily, but I sacrifice tact for truth in some cases. Can I make the case that it's true? If someone pushes, I'll push back. If your problem is with a lack of sensitivity, we'll have little in common. If you base your life on the premise that things fall up, why should I feed your delusion instead of trying to teach you?\n\n \n Er, since when is sensitivity not an important value in human culture? You're not just talking about religious zealotry, you're talking about what gives people solace in the death of loved ones or comfort in times of tragedy. That's the problem with making the point that what is sacred and what billions like is delusional and bad--it IS an insensitive approach. It's essentially telling the grieving widow to shut up when she it goes her solace to say something spiritual in context. There's a reason that you're so much in the minority when it comes to this sort of thing. There really aren't many Chris Hitches' or Richard Dawkins, and I think the reason is that most people don't mind religion being around them, even if they think it's not exactly rational. They aren't going to pick fights over it and tell people \"you're delusional.\"\n \n \nI don't chase down random people. When someone makes it an issue, then it becomes an issue. If a religious person makes a habit of expressing his/her religiosity, they've opened the door.\n\n \n And let me guess--all that's needed to constitute 'making it an issue' is just to talk about one's religion, huh? \n \n \nThere's a fine line between intolerance and standing up for rights. Where than line falls seems to be subjective. An atheist objecting to a violation of church-state separation gets branded an intolerant \"neoatheist\" activist. Schools have Fellowships of Christian Students/Athletes, but I'm confident that there'd be hell to pay if I wanted to start a voluntary freethinker group at school.\n\n \n IMO that's more of a reflection that atheism as a mindset is a lot more rare than religion as a mindset, than anything else such as intolerance. I'd have no problem with such a group though, myself.\n \n \nI call it delusional to think that they are anything more than standard promises because they happened to occur at a big ceremony or in a church. Perhaps there is a stronger will to obey them due to context, but I don't think there's any special religious influence.\n\n \n But the point is that you likely wouldn't go up to the bride and groom afterward and tell them that. You'd respect their beliefs and their ceremony too much. (At least I HOPE that's the case!) Religion itself is like that, but it has become socially popular among atheists to play the whole Dawkins thing and make statements about \"delusional\" rather than just letting religion be. Doing is is LIKE telling the bride and groom that. No one is saying you can't think that if you want. But it demonstrates an intolerance of views you don't agree with to pick fights over them publicly.",

   "Just a personal story Peeling, to explain how rational christians think. When my daughters were born, I dedicated each of them to the Lord and prayed that He would place a hedge of Angels around them for their complete lives in order to protect them from all violence and harm. Now believing fervently in that hedge existing around them to this day, I still never allowed them to play in the middle of the highway, or play with dangerous guns, toys or machinery as children. Because the bible also say's not to test the Lord. So allowing my daughters to do dangerous things before they were old enough to handle them would have been irresponsible. \n \n I also prayed for healing for my daughters when ever they got a temperature, a runny nose or a stomach ache as they grew up. But if their pain or discomfort persisted, or their temperature continued to rise, we immediately took them to the doctor. Even the Apostle Paul prayed only 3 times for the Lord to remove the thorn from his side. So praying for healing is not wrong at all, but refusing to utilize the medical knowledge God has allowed us to discover when prayer isn't working is a sin in my opinion. Christians must understand that it isn't always Gods will that we be healed supernaturally. \n \n So when so called religious people refuse medical care in favor of faith healing, and risk their children's lives when a reasonable amount of prayer has failed to heal them, they are just plain wrong in their inaction, and in my opinion, their actions which are based on ignorance, translate to a form of child abuse and they are therefore culpable if their denial of medical care leads to death or disability to the child that's being denied medical care.",

It's disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise. \n \nWhy is it that one can't pray for their children AND take them to the doctor?\n\n They can, and of course should. That's the point. You know, rationally, that doctors save lives and that prayer alone does not. In short, you insist that rationality rule the day here at the expense of what those people happened to believe, which is that sufficiently earnest prayer can and does heal.\n \n Obviously I'm not making myself clear enough. What I'm calling attention to is the inconsistency you exhibit when discussing faith. When I talk about presumably harmless cargo cults, you declare you wouldn't presume to tell them they should seperate fact from faith. Yet when lives are at stake, you presume a great deal. You presume to tell people that they should take their child to the doctor, despite their religion telling them that to do so is to demonstrate a lack of faith in the healing power of prayer. \n \n What you are doing is using rational decision making to distinguish between the occasions where delusion is harmless and the occasions when it is potentially dangerous. That's great; I'm all for it. What you don't seem to understand is that your permissive attitude to truly 'blind' faith in situations where it happens to be harmless only makes sense from your perspective, as an outsider looking in and judging potential for harm. You don't seem to understand that from the inside, all blind faith looks the same. The blind faiths that are OK are OK by accident, not design, because the elevation of faith above reason is a de facto elimination of the possibility of such design.\n \n The people who let their child die genuinely believed they were doing the right thing. They had exactly the same kind of blind faith the cargo cult members have, only about different things. The very rationality you employ to determine harm they reject in favour of fervour. All I'm asking is that you think carefully before continuing to say that such a worldview is OK, because it's only OK when there are people like you to keep watch over the faithful to make sure they don't start blindly believing something dangerous. I think it's an inherently flawed and dangerous worldview that robs a person of the ability to determine when their beliefs are leading them astray, and I don't believe it should be indulged on the grounds that sometimes nobody gets hurt.\n \nTheir problem wasn't that they believe prayer would work. Their problem was that they didn't go to the doctor.\n\n Because they believed that would demonstrate a lack of faith in the power of prayer to heal directly - which of course it does. You cannot escape that fact: saying that people often pray doctors will do their job well is neither here nor there. They, like you, have reached a comfortable accommodation between reason and religion, with reason taking the lead. \n \nNo, no. They SHOULD go to the doctor. That's not the same as the issue of whether they should or shouldn't pray if they want to.\n\n In other words, they shouldn't believe that going to the doctor demonstrates a lack of faith, or that prayer will heal directly. You are expressing an opinion as to what constitutes an acceptable religious belief, based on reason and evidence.\n \nThis isn't a case of faith above reason or reason above faith. The simple reality is that the issue here is people should go to the doctor when they need to. They can still have faith just as much as they want because they can still pray as much as they want.\n\n This rings terribly hollow. The simple reality is that people should go to the doctor because you know doctors work. They should therefore not entertain any beliefs that involve replacing doctors with prayer. I totally agree. The compromise you've reached is perfectly rational. Trouble is, you don't seem to see that as placing reason above faith, when it emphatically is.",

   "Because you're telling them prayer doesn't heal. It's disingenuous of you to pretend otherwise.\n\n \n No, that's absolutely not the case. And I can't understand for the life of my why you find it to be an either/or scenario. There are 2 reasons it's not the case: a.) because going to a doctor doesn't require one to believe prayer doesn't heal, and b.) because medical care falls under the auspices of God's sovereignty for most praying people. Do you not realise that many doctors themselves pray for their patients, or for God to steady their hand during surgery? How is medical care quantifiably compromised by that sort of thing? When medical care gets compromised, it's not done because of any nature of Faith itself. Faith depends entirely on the person exibiting it; there's no central committee determining what constitutes real faith and what doesn't. There's no reason that a faith that allows people to go the doctor is a less of a faith than one that doesn't allow them to. The answer to this problem is in getting people to go to doctors, not telling them they shouldn't have faith or shouldn't pray.\n \n \nThey can, and of course should. That's the point. You know, rationally, that doctors save lives and that prayer alone does not.\n\n \n I certainly do believe prayer can save lives alone. Nevertheless, people should go to doctors; after all God has given people a perfectly good avenue to receive medical help.\n \n \nObviously I'm not making myself clear enough. What I'm calling attention to is the inconsistency you exhibit when discussing faith. When I talk about presumably harmless cargo cults, you declare you wouldn't presume to tell them they should seperate fact from faith. Yet when lives are at stake, you presume a great deal. You presume to tell people that they should take their child to the doctor, despite their religion telling them that to do so is to demonstrate a lack of faith in the healing power of prayer. \n\n \n That may be the case with your so-called cargo cults, but the issue here to me is whether you would say people shouldn't pray just because some do it at the expense of seeking medical care. Tell you what: I'm perfectly content at you viewing this as a lack of faith (as I see it's so clearly not) and inconsistent on the part of religious people if you're willing to live and let live when it comes to prayer (as long as people use medical care, of course). It's becoming clear to me that you can't get past this either/or scenario in your thinking and the only thing I can conclude is that you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the way many praying people understand prayer. That's ok--as long as people are seeking medical care, everyone here should be happy, including you. Even if they still pray. :) \n \n \nWhat you are doing is using rational decision making to distinguish between the occasions where delusion is harmless and the occasions when it is potentially dangerous. That's great; I'm all for it.\n \n \n It's never dangerous if medical care is being sought. What makes it dangerous is not that prayer takes place, but that medical care does NOT take place. This reminds me of the safe-sex debate, where the argument is made that sex is ok as long as they are doing it safely.\n \n \nWhat you don't seem to understand is that your permissive attitude to truly 'blind' faith in situations where it happens to be harmless only makes sense from your perspective, as an outsider looking in and judging potential for harm. You don't seem to understand that from the inside, all blind faith looks the same. It's like saying that it's OK for a child to play with a gun because you know it's not loaded.\n\n \n So it's \"blind faith\" you have a problem with then, and not faith in a more general sense? You have no problem with faith or prayer as long as they don't compromise the seeking of medical care?\n \n (Also, let's be factual here. It might seem shocking for a child to play with a gun, but if that gun is not loaded there is simply no way a child could be harmed by it. Well, other than using it for a blunt instrument, which could be done with any number of objects. I'm not saying I would let my child do so, but if I know for a fact the gun isn't loaded, then it IS ok (from the standpoint of harm to that child) if they were to play with it.))\n \n And if you think it's ALL 'blind faith', then I can't help but ask: does blind faith that doesn't compromise the seeking of medical care really look the same to you as blind faith that does? Because if it does, I don't know what else to tell you. Frankly I don't see how I'm going to be able to convince you of this; to me it's a no-brainer. I don't mean that disrespectfully, but again, there's just nothing wrong with it if it's not impeding the seeking of medical care.\n \n \nAll I'm asking is that you think carefully before continuing to say that such a worldview is OK, because it's only OK when there are people like you to keep watch over the faithful to make sure they don't start blindly believing something dangerous.\n\n \n Where their religious belief went wrong wasn't in the fact they prayed, but in the fact they didn't seek medical care. Again, remember that for many religious people, faith and seeking medical care are not incompatible at all.\n \n \nThis rings terribly hollow. The simple reality is that people should go to the doctor because you know doctors work. They should therefore not entertain any beliefs that involve replacing doctors with prayer. I totally agree. The compromise you've reached is perfectly rational. Trouble is, you don't seem to see that as placing reason above faith, when it emphatically is.\n\n \n \"Replacing\"? If all you are worried about is replacing medical care with prayer, then can we assume you have no problem with prayer as long as people go to the doctor no less? It's that very thing you just said--\"replacing\"--that's the bad part, not praying to begin with. Ask yourself this, and please, be honest: if someone prays but goes to the doctor no less, how is it they are harmed by that? I don't know any religious person who has ever really substituted medical care for prayer. Again--and I don't know how I could be any more clear--the proper response isn't to get rid of prayer, it's to make sure people KEEP going to the doctor. \n \n The reason it's not necessarily placing reason above faith in practice is that religious people believe that BOTH work. In other words, they are going to the doctor because it works. Why else do you think they are doing it?",

Nobody demands that teachers convert before signing a contract. Nobody demands that religious practices must be abandoned during school hours. Where the hell are you coming up with the whole \"they say teachers can't be religious\" nonsense? The teacher simply cannot endorse any religion (or non-religion) acting as a state employee. What is do damn hard to understand about this?\n \n \nFurthermore, to invoke separation of church and state is to invoke the very amendment which also gives freedom of speech--therefore you're contradicting the amendment in the same moment you're invoking it in this case.\n\n But all of these \"freedoms\" have restrictions. If my religion says that I should speak freely by slashing your jugular, tough sh*t for my religion and freedom of speech, because it doesn't give me the right to do that. Nobody gets to impose their religion upon others, and nobody gets to have their religion endorsed by a government that is not supposed to endorse religion precisely to protect people from such imposition. Once again, I don't understand what's so complicated about this. Religious people should love separation of church and state because it protects them. I'm not religious, and I love it because it protects me. It's win/win.\n \n \nSure they do--people freak out all the time when politicians do so--for example, GWB's being religious has been a favorite subject of criticisms among his critics.\n\n No, people freak out when politicians espouse bonehead ideas that happen to be due to their religion. That Huckabee is a Christian doesn't scare me; the fact that he's so bass-ackward (he's selectively anti-science -- he thinks evolution is a sham -- and he doesn't give a rip about separation) makes him easy for me to write off. I can say the same about somebody who thinks that China is in Antarctica and that two plus two equals five. It's just that religion is -- and you know that there's no denying this, both through history and currently -- an excellent source of bonehead ideas.\n \n \nBut you've already made clear you don't just limit your opinion that religion shouldn't be shared to cases of 'injecting it into lessons.'\n\n Gee jyoshu, I didn't think I was being so hard to understand. No teaching religion. No endorsing religion as a state employee. The courts have suggested that talking about personal religion when asked is okay as long as it's not presented as curriculum. We have separation for a reason. What don't you understand here?\n \n \nI suspect the line is blurred in the thinking of your students more than you may realise. Kids are often looking for a role-model, and your values likely come through more than you may know.\n\n No, I realize perfectly. But I don't violate their trust and eagerness by worming propogana to their ears. They eat up references to my personal life because I rarely make those references. And I use this to my advantage. But this is hobby stuff like basketball, gaming, and social networking. Never philosophy or religion, because (1) I don't need to and (2) it's morally questionable at best.\n \n \nKids are going to do that and we shouldn't just try to sterilize their environment of all-things-moralistic or religious.\n\n But I'm in no place to educate them about moral codes or religious beliefs. I set examples of how to behave responsibly, respectfully, and fairly. That's all I do, and that's all I need to do. And anybody can do this without violating rights. Nobody needs to be alluding to religious beliefs or recounting Bible stories to do their teaching jobs.\n \n \nsince when is sensitivity not an important value in human culture?\n\n 1) Since when is rationality not an important value in human culture? Can you see the fallacy you're committing here?\n 2) When did I say sensitivity wasn't important? I don't track down widows and tell them that their husband is just plain dead. That said, would you like it better if I did? I mean, I could be insensitive 100% of the time if that makes you feel better... emoticon_rolleyes It's a matter of which is more important, and this is where people will disagree. See also below.\n \n \nThat's the problem with making the point that what is sacred and what billions like is delusional and bad--it IS an insensitive approach.\n\n If your major problem with calling a spade a spade is that it's insensitive, then my response is: TOUGH S***. It's one thing to take personal comfort in your beliefs, no matter how idiotic they may be. It's quite another to take idiotic beliefs and do stupid and/or oppressive things with them.\n Seriously, it's like your argument here is, \"Yeah, these beliefs may be indefensible, BUT I HAVE FEELINGS!\" If the beliefs are worthy of criticism, then they're worthy of criticism. Nobody should get a free pass because they're a crybaby. \n \n \nAnd let me guess--all that's needed to constitute 'making it an issue' is just to talk about one's religion, huh?\n\n I talked about religion today just before leaving work, actually. My conversation partner didn't make any comments about how atheists are stupid, or how his religion is the mostest awesomest ever. The conversation was civil; there was no attacking, no challenging, no namecalling. (Of course, he doesn't know that I'm an atheist, let alone a non-Christian... and I don't dare share that information yet.)\n If I'd wanted to, I could have popped off some doozies to make the guy do some serious thinking. But there was no need; he wasn't agressive and didn't need to be rebuffed. A couple of simple conversations between friends, and I don't particularly mind. But continually? Assuming that everyone agrees? Being abusive? Pushing religious agendas that contradict reason? That earns a swift kick in the XXX.\n \n \nIMO that's more of a reflection that atheism as a mindset is a lot more rare than religion as a mindset, than anything else such as intolerance. I'd have no problem with such a group though, myself.\n\n You apparently don't live where I live. There's a reason my conversation partners don't know that I'm not a Christian. I'd like to keep my job.\n \n \nReligion itself is like that, but it has become socially popular among atheists to play the whole Dawkins thing and make statements about \"delusional\" rather than just letting religion be.\n\n \"Socially popular\"? What are you smoking? You think we have our EAC meetings and say, \"Hey, wouldn't it be fun to trash religion? Richie did, so let's join in!\" \n But religion itself is not always like that. Religion has its evils, too. Refute Dawkins's points, and we'll talk. Whining about \"meanies\" isn't very compelling.",

   "No, that's absolutely not the case.\n\n Yes, it is, jyoshu. Phrase it any way you like - that god uses doctors to heal people, that you should pray for god to guide them - you're still saying there's a right and a wrong way to believe in the power of prayer. Specifically, one should not believe that visiting the doctor betrays a lack of faith in the power of prayer to heal. You're telling those people that their religious beliefs were wrong.\n \nAnd I can't understand for the life of my why you find it to be an either/or scenario.\n\n I don't, and neither do you. That's not the point and it never has been. Whether or not prayer and medicine can co-exist is secondary to the fact that reason must stand guard over faith to be sure they do.\n \nIt's becoming clear to me that you can't get past this either/or scenario in your thinking\n\n I don't understand how you can think that when I've made clear statements to the contrary, over and over and over. Here it is again: I know it's not an either-or scenario.\n \n What's important - what this discussion is about - is why you and I know that. We know it because reason and rationality dictate what we allow ourselves to believe. \n \nAnd if you think it's ALL 'blind faith', then I can't help but ask: does blind faith that doesn't compromise the seeking of medical care really look the same to you as blind faith that does?\n\n No, I don't think it's all blind faith - I don't think yours is, for example. But you've finally hit the nail I've been brandishing on the head: the only thing that seperates blind faith that does no harm from blind faith that does is happy accident.\n \n The following analogy came to me last night as I was puzzling over how best to get my point across. \n \n One might liken the blind faith of the cargo cult to someone wandering around with their eyes tight shut in a large open field with no rocks to trip over and nothing to bump into. Pointless but probably harmless. Your attitude to that, as I've quoted before, is:\n \nIf the adherents of that religious group are happy and content with that life, then I'm not going to presume to tell them they shouldn't accept that as scientific fact OR religious truth.\n\n Translating that into our analogy:\n \"If someone wants to wander around with their eyes shut in an open field, I'm not going to presume to tell them they shouldn't.\"\n \n The faith that led to the negligent death of a child might be likened to wandering around with your eyes shut, holding a baby, on the edge of a cliff. Your attitude to that, crudely translated: \"Clearly that's a stupid and dangerous thing to do and should be discouraged.\" Which is of course correct. \n \n Where you go wrong is in perceiving the problem to be where people are wandering around with their eyes shut. And the reason you're wrong is this: people wandering around with their eyes shut can't see where it is they're doing it. They're helpless; they're denied the very information you use to decide whether the place they've chosen is safe or not.\n \n With regards to this 'either or' mentality I supposedly have: you've got it into your head that I'm trying to persuade everyone to stop wandering around - stop having religious beliefs - because sometimes people fall off cliffs that way. I'm not. I'm trying to get people to appreciate the value of keeping their eyes open.\n \n You're a cliff-wanderer in that you entertain the belief that prayer can heal despite no evidence to that effect. But you've got your eyes open, so you're OK. And I would be absolutely fine with you if you consistently acknowledged how important it is that you do have your eyes open; how that keeps you safe. But you don't. Instead you indulge and endorse blind faith in situations you can see are harmless, and you constantly downplay the dominant role reason plays in shaping your beliefs. I can't decide whether that's a simple failure to appreciate the Catch 22 involved, an attempt to appease all sides, or - as I hinted at earlier - a belief that blind faith should be endorsed on its own merits and the fuster-clucks it occasionally throws up dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\n \n I suspect it might be the latter option. Here's why I'm fundamentally opposed to that:\n \n In the past you've compared faith to, say, drinking. We don't ban drinking just because some people do it to excess. Similarly, we don't ban guns just because some people use them to kill people. These analogies fail because we can say 'drinking is fun, but don't do it to excess because...'. We can say 'Shooting guns is fun, but don't shoot them at people because...'. What we can't say is 'Elevating blind faith above reason is good, but make sure you do it safely,' any more than we can say 'Wandering around with your eyes shut is great, so long as you can see you're not going to fall off a cliff'. You cannot in good conscience advocate a practice which inherently denies its practitioners the ability to know whether they're doing it safely or not.",

I don't have any less of a view of prayer (in terms of what it's capable of doing) than they do. Quite the contrary--prayer is only going to potentially make the situation BETTER. That's what I don't think you're getting here. It's not an elevating of either above the other; it's rather doing both.\n \n \nI'll say it one more time: I'm not trying to stop people wandering around; I just want them to keep their eyes open while they're doing it, in case there's a cliff nearby.

The only way wandering around a with a cliff nearby with eyes closed would be analogous would be if you're analogizing praying without going to the doctor, and we've already established that we both think people should go to doctors. What I want to know is if your thinking goes a step farther and associates prayer period with that sort of thing, rather than drawing a distinction and saying prayer as long as people go to doctors is fine, though I can't seem to get you to come right out and say so. It's not prayer that's harmful. It's the not going to doctors. I realize you're finding my repetition of that statement frustrating, but it seems I can't say it enough in this conversation. IMO, it's the heart and soul of the real issue here; that the tendency among some is to blame prayer and faith, when in fact prayer and faith exists all the time in cases where people go to the doctor no less. Again, it's like the safe sex debate. We don't tell people 'stop having sex altogether.' We tell them to do it safely. That's the way faith and prayer are. They are fine as long as people do it safely, and go to doctors no less. Bottom line: it's not the faith and prayer of the cargo cult that is the problem. See, lots of people who DO go to doctors have faith and prayer.) It's the fact they won't go to the doctor that I have the problem with.\n \n And look at your paragraph there--to me it's you who looks inconsistent.

   "Then you're taking issue with not going to doctors in this case as faith above reason? It's not praying at all that you view that way? You're ok with people praying as long as they go to doctors no less?\n\n Of course. All the evidence suggests it's a waste of time, but if it's a harmless and comforting waste of time, so what? The principle issue is that of differing relationships between faith and reason; the specific rituals and beliefs those relationships spawn are relevant only so far as they provide evidence of the relative merit of the parent worldview.\n \nNo, my decision to go to doctors has nothing to do with the idea prayer isn't sufficient. I don't have any less of a view of prayer (in terms of what it's capable of doing) than they do.\n\n There are a couple of points to be made here. First, you don't double-bag unless you're worried one might not hold your shopping. That's not to say you don't believe it could, only that you're unsure it will. Similarly in terms of faith, it's not what you believe is possible that measures your fervour, it's how certain you are. You are not sufficiently certain that prayer alone is how god will heal your family to rely absolutely on that method - thus your faith in it can accurately be described as less. If you don't like the word 'less' for whatever reason, feel free to substitute 'appropriate' or 'not excessive'.\n \n Secondly, yours is a sophisticated belief structure, one that has been powerfully shaped by reason. You are able to argue cogently that since it's impossible to prove prayer never heals, your choice to believe that it can is a personal one and not subject to the approval of others. You can also rationally satisfy people like me and more importantly yourself that your faith is not placing you or your family in unnecessary danger. At every turn, reason imposes parameters upon your choice of beliefs - which is of course a good thing.\n \n Your defence of religion is predicated upon the fact it can be practised like that. And as I've said several times now, if you were consistent and clear in advocating religion on that basis alone, we wouldn't be having this argument.\n \nAnd look at your paragraph there--to me it's you who looks inconsistent. On one hand you say you're not trying to stop people from wandering around, yet on the other hand you want me to join you in condemning blind faith. If you're trying to condemn it, you're position is basically that you are trying to stop it, if only rhetorically.\n\n I thought I had made myself clearer than that. Presumably I was wrong :)\n \n In my analogy, wandering around translates to choosing things to believe. If your eyes are open, then reason is guiding your footsteps and protecting you and others from harm, and I have no quarrel with that.\n \n You, like the parents of the child who died untended, are a cliff-wanderer in that the healing power of prayer is within the scope of your beliefs. But because your eyes are open you can steer clear of the brink. What I'm trying to help you appreciate is that you criticising those people for stepping where they did is farcical when you simultaneously endorse the practice of keeping your eyes shut, which was the ultimate cause of their downfall.\n \n I understand that blind faith is not always harmful. But unlike sex, or alchohol, or guns, it's impossible to practice blind faith safely. It's more aptly likened to Russian roulette. What you've been doing is defending your advocacy of Russian roulette by pointing out that a) it's not always harmful, and b) the people who do get hurt shouldn't have been so stupid as to pull the trigger when there was a bullet in the chamber. It's nonsense. The game is inherently dangerous and cannot be played safely. That's why I ask you to join me in condemning blind faith.",

   "Just a personal story Peeling, to explain how rational christians think. When my daughters were born, I dedicated each of them to the Lord and prayed that He would place a hedge of Angels around them for their complete lives in order to protect them from all violence and harm. Now believing fervently in that hedge existing around them to this day, I still never allowed them to play in the middle of the highway, or play with dangerous guns, toys or machinery as children. Because the bible also say's not to test the Lord. So allowing my daughters to do dangerous things before they were old enough to handle them would have been irresponsible.\n\n Precisely my point: you construct a framework within which you can entertain your 'fervent' belief without ever actually putting it to the test. Like a sportscar you keep in an air-conditioned garage rather than taking it out on the track. You've even come up with a rationalisation for why that doesn't count as a lack of faith - or rather, someone else did and you've adopted it.\n \n The problem I have is that when you talk to other people, you tend not to mention the mental caveats and safety nets that keep you and your family safe from your faith.

So I ask you, what would you have me do to show the proper balance between faith and action as a responsible parent? Because it seems nothing I do will satisfy you.\n \n \nI distinctly recall you talking about how you know absolutely that prayer heals, and how praying for your child absolutely and definitely healed her. Those words have great power to cause harm if they find fertile soil in a mind less enamoured of reason.\n\n \n You're right about that event, and if you also recall, she was healed instantly, before I removed my hand from her forehead where I placed it as I prayed for her healing in Jesus name and according to His Will. Regarding the bolded, as in all things, the spiritual gifts must be exercised with balance and we must trust God to respond to us, and if He doesn't, then we must use the avenues He made available to us through medicine which I also consider miraculous technology. For parents to ignore that after waiting a reasonable amount of time for their prayers to be answered is irresponsible and child abuse, in my opinion. \n \n \nI quite agree - but judging what constitutes a reasonable amount of prayer necessitates a reasonable mind, and I think that message often gets lost in the shorthand when faith is being advocated.\n\n \n It was never a problem for me or ANY BELIEVERS I have ever known in 32+ years of being a believer. Only these cultish off shoots seem to have these issues arise. \n \n \nIn some respects I think you play an even more daring game of brinkmanship than jyoshu, indulging irrationality to a far greater extent in some areas than others. For instance, you would never in a million years forego medical treatment if I said, with no evidence to back me up, that 'unknown and unknowable variables' were making it just look like your child was getting sicker and sicker when in fact he or she was getting better. Yet you'll happily make that same argument and switch off your appreciation of its empty irrationality when discussing evolution or the age of the universe.\n\n \n Please explain specifically what you find irrational about anything in my post we are referring to Peeling? And regarding your comparison of healing, and evolution; I have personally experienced healing in my life experience, so I know the spiritual perspective I embrace is absolutely true. Which leads me to believe the rest of what the bible say's because so much of it has been personally confirmed for me. This is why I trust the unprovable Word of God instead of the unprovable beliefs of evolution. \n \n And also because evo is a man made science and has no hope of being true because it conflicts directly with what God say's happened. So If I must choose between Man and God, I will always choose God. Again, here's my previous post; what is irrational about it again?\n \n \n Just a personal story Peeling, to explain how rational christians think. When my daughters were born, I dedicated each of them to the Lord and prayed that He would place a hedge of Angels around them for their complete lives in order to protect them from all violence and harm. Now believing fervently in that hedge existing around them to this day, I still never allowed them to play in the middle of the highway, or play with dangerous guns, toys or machinery as children. Because the bible also say's not to test the Lord. So allowing my daughters to do dangerous things before they were old enough to handle them would have been irresponsible. \n \n I also prayed for healing for my daughters when ever they got a temperature, a runny nose or a stomach ache as they grew up. But if their pain or discomfort persisted, or their temperature continued to rise, we immediately took them to the doctor. Even the Apostle Paul prayed only 3 times for the Lord to remove the thorn from his side. So praying for healing is not wrong at all, but refusing to utilize the medical knowledge God has allowed us to discover when prayer isn't working is a sin in my opinion. Christians must understand that it isn't always Gods will that we be healed supernaturally. \n \n So when so called religious people refuse medical care in favor of faith healing, and risk their children's lives when a reasonable amount of prayer has failed to heal them, they are just plain wrong in their inaction, and in my opinion, their actions which are based on ignorance, translate to a form of child abuse and they are therefore culpable if their denial of medical care leads to death or disability to the child that's being denied medical care.\n \n",

To me faith is not like double-bagging at all--in other words it has nothing to do with 'not being sufficiently certain'. It's being done in tandem with going to the doctor--in fact going to the doctor is itself a spiritual exercise (in a sense) often for the many who pray and still go to doctors. That's the crux of the issue--you're compartmentalizing these two things separately--but religious people often don't do that. They view going to the doctor as taking part in the provisions God has put in place.  There's ultimately no difference. Praying and going to the doctor are not pitted against each other to begin with, for many religious peope. It's not faith over reason (or reason over faith), for religious people it's ALL still faith, and for religious people it's ALL still reason.\n \n I can only assume the reason this isn't 'adding up' for you is that it's outside your realm of experience--you aren't religious, and you don't pray.\n \n \nSecondly, yours is a sophisticated belief structure, one that has been powerfully shaped by reason. You are able to argue cogently that since it's impossible to prove prayer never heals, your choice to believe that it can is a personal one and not subject to the approval of others.

There's no higher outside standard of what constitutes what is reasonable--there's no Reasonableness Committee out there deciding the rules. For religious people, prayer is a perfectly reasonable activity. So is going to doctors. But they are also both examples of living a religious faith life as well. \n \n \nIn my analogy, wandering around translates to choosing things to believe. If your eyes are open, then reason is guiding your footsteps and protecting you and others from harm, and I have no quarrel with that.\n\n \n They you have no quarrel with much of religion, because that's still a form of faith. \"Blind\" faith is something that opponents of religion often come up with because they simply don't like the concept of faith at all. Very little religion I know of would suggest we should ignore the provisions God has set in front of us to partake in. \n \n Your view of the 'blind faith' is simply unrealitic, IMO. Do religious people refuse to put food in their mouths and swallow it, opting instead to pray for the food to miraculously appear in their stomachs? No they don't, and the idea that they WOULD do that isn't a part of the concept of faith in the first place. I submit that you simply have a poor understanding of the concept of religious faith.\n \n \nWhat you've been doing is defending your advocacy of Russian roulette by pointing out that a) it's not always harmful, and b) the people who do get hurt shouldn't have been so stupid as to pull the trigger when there was a bullet in the chamber. It's nonsense. The game is inherently dangerous and cannot be played safely. That's why I ask you to join me in condemning blind faith.\n\n \n Where have I defended people not going to doctors? I most certainly have not defended that--what I have defended is that they should be able to have faith. They just still need to go to doctors. What I will gladly join you in condemning is the idea they shouldn't go to a doctor. I don't really care one bit whether their reasons for going is to be \"reasonable\" (as you view it) or to be religious (as I view it). The bottom line is that they need to go to the doctor.",

   "Precisely my point: you construct a framework within which you can entertain your 'fervent' belief without ever actually putting it to the test. Like a sportscar you keep in an air-conditioned garage rather than taking it out on the track. You've even come up with a rationalisation for why that doesn't count as a lack of faith - or rather, someone else did and you've adopted it.\n \n The problem I have is that when you talk to other people, you tend not to mention the mental caveats and safety nets that keep you and your family safe from your faith. I distinctly recall you talking about how you know absolutely that prayer heals, and how praying for your child absolutely and definitely healed her. Those words have great power to cause harm if they find fertile soil in a mind less enamoured of reason.\n\n \n If I may comment on your post to Archangel ...\n \n That's the case ONLY if you think God would always limit his provision to a 'miraculous magical-sort' of sans-doctor response. In other words, you aren't taking into account that God might answer the prayer VIA the doctor's work. This goes to the heart of what I've been trying to get you see. If someone prays to get well, then goes to the doctor, their action of going to the doctor isn't indicative of a lack of faith (as you seem to think). It's not 'double-bagging', nor is their prayer 'double-bagging.' In fact, it's quite the opposite. It's simply indicative of using provision that God has put in place for them already. If we pray for God to bless our food to our nourishment, we still EAT the food. We don't assume that God wants to miraculously teleport the nutrients of the food into our bloodstream. God has placed a provision there for us to take part in, and the action of eating goes TOGETHER with our prayer. Not juxtaposed. Do you understand now?\n \n It's also interesting that you brought up the issue of evolution and the age of the universe with Archangel. As you know, I am a theistic evolutionist and I feel such a view is quite consistent with what I'm also saying about prayer. God made creation, and evolution is nothing more than the means by which he maintains it, changes it, etc. Abiogenesis is nothing more than what we observe in terms of the way He created it. So in that sense too, there's no contradiction between science and faith. I do realise, in terms of evolution, many believers see it differently than I do. But the point I want to make is that this (for me) is not an example of faith superceded by something outside the realm of the religious (if you will). In other words, observing how God did something is still partaking in religious faith, in a sense, because it's understood under the auspices of what God does. To someone like me, evolution is ALSO under the auspices of religion, because it is the work of God. So reason doesn't correct faith. It simply corrects the way we assumed God did something with a different way of discovering how God did something. But for me, it all still falls under the category of \"God did it.\" Faith is always going to be a part of it, regardless. The only thing different is understanding of the method that took place.",

   "I can only assume the reason this isn't 'adding up' for you is that it's outside your realm of experience--you aren't religious, and you don't pray.\n\n No, I can add it up just fine - the problem is you're still struggling with the same strawman:\n \nPraying and going to the doctor are not pitted against each other to begin with, for many religious peope.\n\n I'm losing count of the number of times and number of ways I've said I understand that. The issue is not that I believe prayer and medical treatment are mutually exclusive in the eyes of all religious people. I have never said it is - and the obstacle to us reaching an understanding is that you seem unwilling, for whatever reason, to move beyond that non-issue.\n \n The real issue is, however, implicit in your statement:\n \nPraying and going to the doctor are not pitted against each other to begin with, for many religious peope.\n\n Rhetorical question: why for many religious people, and not for all religious people? What factors make people such as yourself safe from adopting potentially harmful beliefs while others fall victim to them?\n \nIf it appears to you that reason is going on, it's happening because what YOU think of as reason just happens to (in this case) coincide with part of what religious people are doing.\n\n If reason is not responsible for guiding your choice of beliefs, then it's just a happy accident that your choice of beliefs is harmless while that of others are harmful. I don't believe that for a moment. When you say 'prayer should complement going to the doctor rather than replace it', what prompts you to make such a statement? Is that really just your blind faith as to what is the right thing to do? Of course not - you've spent pages and pages giving rational reasons why doctors should be included in a religious person's care package, with the inevitable implication that those who relied on prayer alone made a poor and irrational choice.\n \n You really can't have your cake and eat it here, jyoshu. You can't say that reason is not responsible for your choice of beliefs, and at the same time provide rational arguments as to why others should have believed as you do rather than as they did. You're contradicting yourself. If reason does not shape your beliefs then you have no business whatsoever criticising those who choose to believe that prayer is the only method of healing sanctioned by god.\n \nYour view of the 'blind faith' is simply unrealitic, IMO. Do religious people refuse to put food in their mouths and swallow it, opting instead to pray for the food to miraculously appear in their stomachs? No they don't, and the idea that they WOULD do that isn't a part of the concept of faith in the first place. I submit that you simply have a poor understanding of the concept of religious faith.\n\n No, but you're right to point out it's not all-or-nothing - which was the direction I planned to take the discussion once I'd got us on the same page regarding the relevant issue. Sure, hardly anyone would starve to death praying for food to appear in their stomachs. But is that really any more extreme an example of irrationality than allowing your child to die for lack of treatment?\n \n People compartmentalise. If they habitually apply reason before faith, they will most likely do so safely: they, like you, will make good choices as to what to believe. Someone like Archangel sails a little closer to the wind and is rather more cavalier about wearing his rational seat-belt when approaching certain topics. That's evident from his attitude to healing prayer: he'll try it for a while (probably much the same period anyone would give a minor ailment to clear up on its own) and if things improve he credits the prayer and if they don't he calls in the doctor. I'm not for a moment suggesting he personally would do this, but how big a step is it from there to giving prayer a bit more of a chance to do the trick than people would normally allow an illness to go untreated? \n \n I'm not making a slippery slope argument. I'm not saying that going too far is inevitable. What I'm saying is that the safeguards against taking things too far are perforce based in reason, and when those safeguards are lacking - when people perceive faith as a virtue in its own right and gorge themselves - it clearly is possible for harm to result.\n \nWhere have I defended people not going to doctors? I most certainly have not defended that\n\n Again, you're missing the point. You constantly defend the abdication of rationality in favour of faith in situations you rationally know to be harmless. That catch 22 is what I'm trying to get you to appreciate.\n \n \nI don't really care one bit whether their reasons for going is to be \"reasonable\" (as you view it) or to be religious (as I view it). The bottom line is that they need to go to the doctor.\n\n That's a very interesting statement. You don't care whether they do the right thing because they've thought it through, or from sheer happy accident. \n \n If you think my analysis is inaccurate, you need to think carefully about what the alternative is to a choice being based in reason.",

You're contradicting yourself. If reason does not shape your beliefs then you have no business whatsoever criticising those who choose to believe that prayer is the only method of healing sanctioned by god.\n\n \n Sure I can--I just don't do it from the standpoint of reason alone (or rather, what you're considering reason). You forget--it's also a religious idea to take part in God's provision. I have repeated this numerous times now, and you don't seem to be getting it! \n \n \nNo, but you're right to point out it's not all-or-nothing - which was the direction I planned to take the discussion once I'd got us on the same page regarding the relevant issue. Sure, hardly anyone would starve to death praying for food to appear in their stomachs. But is that really any more extreme an example of irrationality than allowing your child to die for lack of treatment?\n\n \n No it's not, but we're both in agreement on the issue of not seeking medical treatment. I think we've covered this. The analogy of eating is there to help you see that going to the doctor is simply a case of partaking in divine providence. That it happens to be reasonable DESPITE religious too to do so is fortunate for your standpoint too I suppose, but it's really beside the point as far as religious people are concerned.\n \n \nPeople compartmentalise. If they habitually apply reason before faith, they will most likely do so safely: they, like you, will make good choices as to what to believe. \n\n \n I'm NOT applying reason before faith. They aren't separate. They aren't juxtaposed. Going to the doctor is a faith-based action, as WELL as happens to be a reason-based action. But I don't go merely because it's \"reasonable\". In other words, I don't sit around and think \"oh, it would be the reasonable thing to do so I'll go to the doctor\"; no, it doesn't work like that. It's a RELIGIOUS concept that God has placed medical provision before us. So when we partake in it, we're also engaging in religious life. (It just so happens it looks rational too, from your standpoint, because going to the doctor means one gets better. But to me the only reason that's the case is because of the provision of God.)\n \n Religious people don't compartmentalize nearly as much, and perhaps that goes to the heart of why you don't seem to be getting this. For us, it's ALL religious. All of life is. Everything we do we do under the sovereignty of God. Including going to doctors.\n \n See, from my standpoint anyone who doesn't take their kids to the doctor is violating FAITH as well. They are violating religion because they are not partaking in the providence of God. So that's not a safeguard based on what you're calling reason, it's a safeguard based on religion (which is, IMO also a form of reason). \n \n I think there are several ways to look at this, though, and a lot of it simply comes down to how one describes it. John Locke argued that religion was one of the most reasonable things there could be, and so for him, abandoning religion was a very unreasonable thing to do. He had some very good points on that. \n \n I'm not saying your way of looking at it is not ok. I'm saying my way of looking at IS ok. \n \n \nAgain, you're missing the point. You constantly defend the abdication of rationality in favour of faith in situations you rationally know to be harmless. That catch 22 is what I'm trying to get you to appreciate.\n\n \n Why is that a catch-22? Where reason compliments and supports religion, that is a good thing.\n \n \nThat's a very interesting statement. You don't care whether they do the right thing because they've thought it through, or from sheer happy accident. \n \n If you think my analysis is inaccurate, you need to think carefully about what the alternative is to a choice being based in reason.\n\n \n I'd say it's still being based on reason, regardless, just not a religion-less reason.

They could never observe anything, or if they did they could never come to any real conclusions about those observations. That's not the way people understand faith, Peeling. No one in the world is like that. You're arguing against a concept so unrealistic it's somewhat ludicrous. If all you're saying here is that faith is almost always informed by reason, then sure. But that's such a basic simple idea that I find it hard to believe it even warrants discussion. Of course we both use observation; that's part of the human experience.

The very fact that people pray things like \"God, please help the surgeon be steady\" or \"help the doctor give the right dignosis\" shows clearly that people don't view going to doctors as betraying faith, but rather a part of it.\n\n That's not answering the question. I asked you to explain why one choice - yours - is better than the other, not to simply restate the obvious: that different choices are being made.\n \nAgain, if you're going to break it down to such a basal level, then anything anyone ever does--religion and faith included, is always going to have rationale of some kind behind it. That doesn't mean reason is being put above faith.\n\n All I can do is direct you back to the obvious truth: the beliefs you have adopted are to a very great extent influenced by your rational appreciation of scientific evidence. You do not simply believe what your received religion tells you (eg literal genesis), instead you accommodate unyielding facts by shaping your beliefs around them. You create a religious interpretation of the facts rather than ignoring facts in favour of a belief.\n \nAnd I say 'so what'? The observations I make (layers of strata, distances between starts) strengthen my faith rather than demonstrate it as weaker.\n\n Because you've chosen beliefs that accommodate such observations. Some people, on the other hand, constantly deny the evidence all around them, inventing 'unknowable unknowns', in the name of preserving their beliefs.\n \nThink about what your version of blind faith would be like: someone would never be able to ever look at anything. They could never use their senses at all, because then they'd be relying on what you call reason. They could never observe anything, or if they did they could never come to any real conclusions about those observations. That's not the way people understand faith, Peeling. No one in the world is like that. You're arguing against a concept so unrealistic it's somewhat ludicrous.\n\n Then why presume that's what I'm arguing against?\n \n As I said before, people compartmentalise - not necessarily their application of a religious interpretation, that does as you say tend to be across the board - but rather their application of reason. On certain topics, what you describe above takes place every few posts here. Review this thread and you'll see umpteen statements to the effect that we can never come to any real conclusions about our observations.\n \nWhat I will agree is right is for people to go to the doctor. (if that's all you mean by \"walking around with one's eyes open\" then sure.)\n\n Going to the doctor is not falling off the cliff. Keeping one's eyes open is how to avoid falling off the cliff.\n \n It's somewhat frustrating to hear you keep saying 'well, obviously people just shouldn't fall off cliffs. Falling off cliffs is a terrible idea. I don't see why you seem to think that walking around means you're going to fall off a cliff; I walk around and I haven't fallen off any cliffs', yet when I prompt you to advocate keeping your eyes open, and point out that that's why you haven't fallen off the cliff despite it being nearby, you balk. 'No,' you retort. 'Look at those cargo-cult people in the field over there; they've got their eyes shut and they're not coming to any harm'.\n \n I just don't understand how you can base your own life around a philosophy of belief shaped by reason, defend religion at every turn by demonstrating the ways in which can be shaped and held in check by reason, condemn those who do stupid things like letting their child die because they didn't use reason to shape their beliefs, and yet refuse point blank to say that using reason, evidence and logic to shape your beliefs is the only right way to go about it.\n \nI think this discussion has gotten way off track into some unnecessarily philosophical turf. I just don't see it as being this complicated. If someone's religion involves the idea that going to doctors is bad, then obviously it's a harmful religion. That's the bottom line, IMO.\n\n There's such a lot glossed over by that single word: obviously. The entire scope of our argument, in fact, is encapsulated therin. Why is it obvious? What do you do in your head in order to reject that belief as harmful and wrong? Isn't it irresponsible of you to go around saying that people don't need to think critically like that if they don't want to?\n \n I expect you'll say that of course people should think critically when there's a risk of harm, and yet for reasons that passeth all understanding you still won't see how crazy that is. \n \n \"Hmm, I'd better check to be sure I'm not putting myself at risk before deciding not to think critically about this subject - ah ####, I just thought critically about it. That crazy jyoshu; he said it was ok not to think critically so long as I ... um... thought critically first. That can't be right...\"",

   "A couple of points here Peeling; first of all, if you have been condemning those religious people who forsake all medical help for their young children in favor of waiting for God to heal them,\n\n Don't you?\n \nand then you criticize me for praying for healing, but going to a doctor if my answer isn't immediately forthcoming as if that means I have no faith at all.\n\n There was no criticism. I simply repeated what you told me and pointed out that you had a rationalisation in place to ensure that whatever happened, your faith would be affirmed.\n \nYou're right about that event, and if you also recall, she was healed instantly, before I removed my hand from her forehead where I placed it as I prayed for her healing in Jesus name and according to His Will.\n\n Yes, and I've been meaning to ask: for how long had she been ill before that happened? Did you perhaps have time to squeeze in one or two other prayers before the one that worked? If that particular prayer hadn't worked, do you think you might have offered up more prayers until she did get better?\n \n In short, isn't it likely that her recovery would have coincided with a prayer regardless of whether it was efficacious?\n \nRegarding the bolded, as in all things, the spiritual gifts must be exercised with balance and we must trust God to respond to us, and if He doesn't, then we must use the avenues He made available to us through medicine which I also consider miraculous technology. For parents to ignore that after waiting a reasonable amount of time for their prayers to be answered is irresponsible and child abuse, in my opinion.\n\n Quite - a reasonable amount of time.\n \nIt was never a problem for me or ANY BELIEVERS I have ever known in 32+ years of being a believer. Only these cultish off shoots seem to have these issues arise.\n\n Strictly speaking, they're no more of a cult than Christianity itself, but more importantly you're drawing a distinction after the fact. You promote religious thinking, and religious thinking is what produces these offshoots; you disown them when it happens, but the fact remains they were good religious believers - only reason tells you they were being stupid. It's somewhat harsh of you to bang on about how reason can't tell us anything with any certainty and then turn around and blame those who come to harm after listening to advice like that.\n \nPlease explain specifically what you find irrational about anything in my post we are referring to Peeling?\n\n The invocation of unknown and unknowable variables and choosing to believe in their existence rather than allowing yourself to be convinced by the evidence. As I said, you would never in a million years accept that as rational if it related to something like the health of your children. But when it comes to evolution and the age of the universe, you simply switch that safeguard off.\n \nAnd regarding your comparison of healing, and evolution; I have personally experienced healing in my life experience, so I know the spiritual perspective I embrace is absolutely true.\n\n I'm very happy for you. Unfortunately for those who are denied such a personal experience, the observable cumulative effect of such 'personal experiences' upon the statistics is zero. \n \n Do you appreciate my problem? We know seatbelts work because there are fewer injuries and fatalities amongst those wearing seatbelts during an accident than amongst those who do not. If there was no statistical difference we would have to conclude that either seatbelts have no effect, or they harm as often as they help. Prayer makes no statistical difference. As I recall your explanation for this was something to do with god's reason being superior to ours and how we shouldn't expect to be able to understand with our limited capacity - in short, ignore what reason tells you and just believe.\n \n Rhetorical question: why don't you do the same with praying for your children to recover? Why not toss out all reason and just believe your prayer will cure them eventually, regardless of the evidence in front of you? When you know that, you'll know why I don't toss out reason and just believe the things you ask me to.\n \nAnd also because evo is a man made science and has no hope of being true because it conflicts directly with what God say's happened.\n\n What the bible says happened. You believe it contains god's word on the subject, but then all you're really doing is justifying one belief with another. It doesn't make you any more likely to be right. \n \n Would you say the degree of fervour exhibited by followers of other religions makes a difference to how right they are? Do you think they're telling the truth when they speak of personal experiences of gods not your own, or do you think they're deluded? Well, imagine I'm you and you're them, and you'll know just how I feel.",

   "Including me - assuming that by faith you mean 'religion'. Faith itself absolutely requires a lack of rationale: proof denies faith.\n\n \n I think the areas of controversy between what looks like faith to you and reason are often really controversies over knowledge only. The faith part comes in on issues that can't be disproven anyway. The age of the earth is not a faith-based issue. It's not even one for IDers; they really do believe, from the standpoint of their reasoning, that the earth is only a few thousand years old. That's why they have a whole creation-science system they use. They too look at layers of rock and distances between stars; they just come to very different conclusions than you do. Now, they are wrong, of course. But scientists are often wrong too, and sometimes they are stubbornly wrong. It doesn't mean they are relying on faith. The Church was the scientific authority for centuries, not just the faith authority. And it's on issues of science and knowledge over which controversies come up; not over faith-type issues. Reason never really disproves faith, because real issues of faith are over non-provable/disprovable issues to begin with. \n \n \nThat's not answering the question. I asked you to explain why one choice - yours - is better than the other, not to simply restate the obvious: that different choices are being made.\n\n \n I can only say it's better for me--I'm not out to convince you it's better for you; everyone has to come to their own conclusions here. But why are you asking me to explain why \"my version of belief in the healing power of prayer (god working through doctors etc) is better than the belief that going to the doctor betrays a lack of faith\", when in fact I've said they are both important and aren't juxtaposed? You keep trying to impose a conflict between two ideas that isn't really there. When going to the doctor is consistent with what God wants, then it's not juxtaposed to faith. If anything, it's a part of it. There IS no \"better\". Religious faith involves doing both.\n \n \nAll I can do is direct you back to the obvious truth: the beliefs you have adopted are to a very great extent influenced by your rational appreciation of scientific evidence.\n\n \n And to that I am saying 'so what?' If one breaks things down to THAT basal of thinking, then one could say that about anything and everything. I just don't see that it's really relevant.\n \n \nYou do not simply believe what your received religion tells you (eg literal genesis), instead you accommodate unyielding facts by shaping your beliefs around them. You create a religious interpretation of the facts rather than ignoring facts in favour of a belief.\n\n \n But my religion doesn't tell me 'literal genesis.' Again, if your point is that I note facts, sure. Again, I'm not sure why that's really that pertinent. We're all human and we use our senses to come to conclusions. We'd have to live life in closed-box or with no senses for it to be otherwise.\n \n \nBecause you've chosen beliefs that accommodate such observations.\n\n \n No, not religious beliefs. Observations have changed what I believe scientifically. There was a time I believed it was scientific that the earth was 6000 years old. That wasn't an exercise of faith; it was what I believed was science. Reading and studying (observation) showed differently, so my scientific view changed. It had nothing to do with 'faith'. Do you see the difference?\n \n \nIt's somewhat frustrating to hear you keep saying 'well, obviously people just shouldn't fall off cliffs. Falling off cliffs is a terrible idea. I don't see why you seem to think that walking around means you're going to fall off a cliff; I walk around and I haven't fallen off any cliffs', yet when I prompt you to advocate keeping your eyes open, and point out that that's why you haven't fallen off the cliff despite it being nearby, you balk. 'No,' you retort. 'Look at those cargo-cult people in the field over there; they've got their eyes shut and they're not coming to any harm'.\n\n \n That's not what I said. I said if they were going to the doctor they wouldn't have come to any harm. Look, lets get to the bottom line here: your problem is with faith. You seem to assert a difference between faith and 'blind faith'; I say that's doublespeak from you. By your own standards, if someone is relying on faith, they are (by definition) exercising a form of blindness, no? You indicate you have no problem with faith, yet you insist that it needs to be informed by reason. And I say reasonable people are ALWAYS informed by reason. That's why your analogy doesn't really work across the board; the cargo cult didn't fail because they were blind. They failed because of a problem in their religion, not in their reasoning. If their religion accommodated going to doctors (as mine happens to) then this would never have been a problem, no matter what reasoning does. They were as capable as anyone to REASON that going to the doctor would help--they are human after all. You keep approaching this as a reason versus faith (oops, I mean \"blind faith\") issue, but it's really a religion versus religion issue. I'm not going to agree to some semantic quibbled concept within an analogy about people walking around blind or not. The bottom line is that if their religion accomodates going to the doctor, I have no problem with it. If their religion DOESN\"T accomodate going to the doctor, I DO have a problem with it because it's harmful (and therefore contradicts what I consider to be an important part of religion, BTW). If you want to call that \"agreeing with not walking around cliffs blindly\" that's up to you. How ever it fits into your analogy or not, that's my take on it. I realise faith comes across to you as a contradiction--that's the nature of faith, and it's always going to look that way to someone who doesn't live that life. I'm not going to say blind faith is always bad because it would be a gross oversimplification to do so.\n \n \nI just don't understand how you can base your own life around a philosophy of belief shaped by reason, defend religion at every turn by demonstrating the ways in which can be shaped and held in check by reason, condemn those who do stupid things like letting their child die because they didn't use reason to shape their beliefs, and yet refuse point blank to say that using reason, evidence and logic to shape your beliefs is the only right way to go about it.\n\n \n Reason and evidence are always a part of peoples' lives--we aren't living in closed boxes. It's just a matter of to what degree and what issue. But again, sure I can agree that reason should inform people, if that's all you mean. But it's only ever going to do so over issues that pertain to reason to begin with.",

The faith part comes in on issues that can't be disproven anyway. <snip< Reason never really disproves faith, because real issues of faith are over non-provable/disprovable issues to begin with.\n\n Thank you so much; I had a total mental block on how to move this discussion forward and you just showed me the way :)\n \n Imagine I'm brought up to believe that the story of Genesis is literal truth, and that the earth is just a few thousand years old. For starters, how does that fit in with your statement that real faith concerns non-disprovable issues? Am I wrong for investing heavily in that belief? Should I be aware - or made aware - that it is a potentially disprovable notion?\n \n The relevance of this is that I did believe in literal Genesis at one point, and that belief was disproved. So where and how does faith fit into that personal experience? Did I just think I had faith when I really didn't, because it was invested in something disprovable? Or are you perhaps mistaken - is faith in the eye of the faithful, and was my faith disproved?\n \n My take on it is that a belief I had chosen to adopt in the absence of evidence was subsequently overturned by evidence. Evidence that was new to me, but which in reality predated my birth by some margin. Other options were open to me. I could have decided to dismiss the evidence; I could have decided there must be facts of which science was ignorant that would vindicate me.\n \nThe age of the earth is not a faith-based issue.\n\n I quite agree, but the question is: what makes you right? It's clearly a faith issue to Archangel (sorry to keep talking about you in the third person AA) according to his own emphatic and repeated statements. In effect, AA has made the choice I rejected: he's decided that on this particular issue, no amount of evidence will ever shake his conviction.\n \n The parents of the dead child made the same choice about a different article of their faith. \n \nIt's not even one for IDers; they really do believe, from the standpoint of their reasoning, that the earth is only a few thousand years old. That's why they have a whole creation-science system they use. They too look at layers of rock and distances between stars; they just come to very different conclusions than you do.\n\n No, I don't buy that I'm afraid. There has never been anything to suggest that sort of timescale. Creationism is not science because certain conclusions must be reached; that is decided in advance. In that it differs from methodological naturalism, in which only naturalistic conclusions are possible to reach, but there is no requirement that we must reach them.\n \nBut why are you asking me to explain why \"my version of belief in the healing power of prayer (god working through doctors etc) is better than the belief that going to the doctor betrays a lack of faith\", when in fact I've said they are both important and aren't juxtaposed?\n\n Surely I can't be reading that right. The belief that god works through doctors doesn't contradict the belief that going to the doctor betrays a lack of faith?\n \nYou keep trying to impose a conflict between two ideas that isn't really there. When going to the doctor is consistent with what God wants, then it's not juxtaposed to faith. If anything, it's a part of it. There IS no \"better\". Religious faith involves doing both.\n\n Mmm, you're still missing the point. It's not about going to the doctor being better than prayer. It's about <the belief that faith isn't juxtaposed with visiting the doctor< being superior to <the belief that going to the doctor betrays a lack of faith<. You clearly think the former is correct, is superior - what I'm trying to get you to step back and appreciate is why you think that, and why some other people don't.\n \nBut my religion doesn't tell me 'literal genesis.'\n\n Not your current model, no :) But is that because your understanding of the evidence concerning the universe's true age and development came before your exposure to Genesis, allowing you to interpret it metaphorically from the very beginning? Or did you modify your beliefs in light of what you learned? Did you perhaps decide that the important part of your belief was the bit that said god was responsible, rather than the bit that said how he did it?\n \nNo, not religious beliefs. Observations have changed what I believe scientifically. There was a time I believed it was scientific that the earth was 6000 years old. That wasn't an exercise of faith; it was what I believed was science. Reading and studying (observation) showed differently, so my scientific view changed. It had nothing to do with 'faith'. Do you see the difference?\n\n There's a difference, but I'm not sure it's the one you're describing. It qualifies as a scientific belief by virtue of you allowing evidence to change it. That choice is the crux of the issue.\n \nYou seem to assert a difference between faith and 'blind faith'; I say that's doublespeak from you. By your own standards, if someone is relying on faith, they are (by definition) exercising a form of blindness, no? \n\n No. You made the same distinction yourself, only in different (and frankly better) words: real issues of faith are those which cannot be disproved.\n \n However, the reality of the human condition is that we are always in danger of bumping up against evidence that disproves - or at least forces a reinterpretation of something we have taken on faith. Sometimes it's the age of the earth, and sometimes it's the healing power of prayer.\n \nThe bottom line is that if their religion accomodates going to the doctor, I have no problem with it. If their religion DOESN\"T accomodate going to the doctor, I DO have a problem with it because it's harmful (and therefore contradicts what I consider to be an important part of religion, BTW).\n \n I know you think that's the bottom line, but it really isn't. The bottom line is that on the one hand you're prepared to sit in judgement over these religions, while on the other you endorse modes of thinking that degrade the ability of a person to make those same judgements for themselves.\n \nI'm not going to say blind faith is always bad because it would be a gross oversimplification to do so.\n\n 'Bad' is the oversimplification, in the same way that 'harmful' would be. It would be an oversimplification to call Russian roulette 'harmful', because of course there's a good chance it won't be in each individual case.\n \n I would say instead that blind faith - or in your terms, investing a great deal of faith in a subject which is or turns out to be susceptible to disproof - cannot, by definition, be practiced safely. In order for a belief to be safe, one must be willing to be swayed by evidence that indicates it is not safe. One must be willing to re-evaluate, to arrive at a more enlightened spiritual interpretation. Approach all challenges to your beliefs with that attitude and you'll minimise the universe's opportunities to play silly-buggers with you. I think that's the only advice one can responsibly offer to others. I don't think it's right for you to say that it's ok to just ignore the evidence and carry on believing, when what you really mean is 'Once you've looked at the evidence and established that it doesn't imply you're putting yourself in harm's way, it's ok to just ignore the evidence and carry on believing'. Nor do I believe you're being honest with yourself when you refuse to admit the latter course of action constitutes putting reason before faith :)",

The issue here is your acceptance of what constitutes a source for reasonable knowledge versus what constitutes such a source for him. That's the thing: for Biblical literalists, the Bible is a scientific source. \n \n \nNo, I don't buy that I'm afraid. There has never been anything to suggest that sort of timescale.

Science, if you will. It wasn't a faith-based issue. That's why, in a sense, this is really two competing areas of understanding the universe. It's an outdated rational model versus a newer, more accurate model. \n \n Take the copernican versus ptolemaic model of the universe. At one time, people were sure that the ptolemaic model was correct, because it was what they actually observed. From their vantage point, it really did look like the earth (where we are, on the ground) was stationary and the whole universe moved around it. It wasn't faith that was involved; they were operating on what they saw, as well as what they were taught by the only scientific authority they knew of. The only reason 6 day creationism 'is decided in advance' is because it was a scientific mindset PREVIOUS to the current scientific view. The Bible was the science book, in a sense. \n \n \nMmm, you're still missing the point. It's not about going to the doctor being better than prayer.

I think stubbornness is often the real issue with that; we see that with scientists sometimes too who are slow to accept a more up-to-date source that's more accurate.

   "Well, it was disproven, what it not? I'm of the opinion it was NEVER a faith-based issue to begin with.\n\n But how was I to know that? How is anyone supposed to know what will and will not turn out to be disprovable, let alone a child? It's not fair of you to apply 20-20 hindsight to the situation in which I found myself and thus insist my faith wasn't really being challenged, just so you don't have to admit that reason and faith can and do come into conflict through no fault of the person involved.\n \n What I'm saying is that because such events are an inevitable part of the human condition, we should try to forewarn and forearm people as to how to deal with them, rather than - as you do - telling them it's perfectly OK to be unreasonable and then judging them after the fact when their unreason gets them into trouble.\n \nWhy should we assume 6 day creationism is ONLY a faith-based issue to AA?

And we know what happened next as scientific testing of the theory failed to bear it out.\n \nHonestly, I'm not even sure I can follow all that.

Ask yourself: what is it that tells you X is an issue of faith and Y is not? What is it prevents you from deciding it's OK to make Y an issue of faith?\n \nBut what I think you're missing is that I stand in judgment over them because they are unreasonable, not because they exercise faith.\n\n No, I'm not missing that! That's the point I've been trying to hammer home for days now! Look back over our argument: this is the first time you've ever criticised those people for their unreasonable approach to beliefs rather than the specific beliefs they had. Finally, you're tackling why they were able to believe as they did.\n \nthen it's not real faith, to begin with. It's over a fact-based issue, which is WHY it was disprovable in the first place.\n\n Again, it's unfair of you to make after-the-fact judgements about what is and is not an issue of faith, especially when you have so far refused to consistently advocate equipping people with the tools they need to make the same judgement for themselves.",
