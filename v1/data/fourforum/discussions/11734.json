   "A good piece about the bias of the media favoring Biden and opposed to Palin in the wake of the VP debate a couple of weeks ago ...\n \n \"The media seems to have been covering for Biden for some time. While news stories still talk about Dan Quayle&#8217;s spelling mistake 18 years later, there has been almost no news coverage of Biden&#8217;s numerous wacky statements. What if Quayle had said something similar to Biden&#8217;s recent statement that, \"When the stock market crashed, Franklin D. Roosevelt got on the television and didn't just talk about the, you know, the princes of greed. He said, 'Look, here's what happened.'\" A neat trick given that Herbert Hoover was president in 1929 and no one was watching television.\n \n It might not fit the simple template for a 36-year veteran of the Senate to not understand what vice presidents do (after all, eight vice presidents have served with him), but Biden knew less about this than the political outsider, Sarah Palin. Given that they are running to be vice president, why didn&#8217;t that story dominate the news coverage after the debate?\" Read the whole thing as http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,433314,00.html",

   "Surely you two can do better than just complaining about it having been published by Fox News. That's a cop out. The piece stands un-refuted.\nOf course it does. There's no defense of it to come from the Obama/Biden supporters because the instances proving Biden's lies and ineptness are recorded in history.\n \n It is commonly used tactic of illogical debaters to dismiss evidence based on who presented it rather than speak to the argument presented.\n \n Biden's comments were recorded. Undeniable facts from history show that Biden either lied or doesn't know his subject very well. The MSM seemed rather silent regarding his failure to be accurate.",
