   "I'm normally calm as I watch my T.V.\n \n It's not inter-active, so I never see\n \n Much point in my yelling out \"deal!\" or \"no deal!\"\n \n Or shouting, no matter how shows make me feel. \n \n \n That's fine for the folks who like doing it, but.\n \n They're having their fun, or they're doing their nut,\n \n Though I've never yelled at the tellie that way.\n \n But bugger me, people. I did it today.\n \n \n A young boy lay bleeding, his mother in tears.\n \n The ambulance officer settled her fears.\n \n \"Your son is okay, 'though the cut is a mess.\n \n Just in the wrong place at the wrong time, I guess.\"\n \n \n The boy's aunt was there, and she knelt by the lad,\n \n And then she said something that just drove me mad.\n \n She said \"Thank you Jesus, for saving young Shaun.\"\n \n I just couldn't help it. I yelled \"Ah COME ON!\"\n \n \n \"You've got to be kidding! The kid just got hit\n \n By a car! And you want to thank God for that ####?\"\n \n Thanks Jesus? I guess it was too hard by far\n \n For Jesus to stop or disable the car.\n \n \n When a Pope got shot, Virgin Mary, he said\n \n Was guiding the bullet away from his head.\n \n I guess she thought moving the bullet was fun,\n \n Or she couldn't be bothered with jamming the gun.\n \n \n So people, be careful. Don't ever relax.\n \n Your typical agents of God can be lax.\n \n In times of great peril, whenever you call\n \n They'll do just enough, if they're bothered at all.",
