One example is our catholic doctor who delivered both of our daughters refused any and all requests for abortions on religious grounds. He didn't care what the circumstances were, he wouldn't abort a child. He referred the case to a local doctor he had an agreement with who did the procedure, but Dr Gamari wouldn't do it under any circumstances and his practice was never jeopardized or considered unethical in any way by anyone. In fact he was highly respected for his moral commitment to only preserve life as a Gynecologist/OGBYN, but never end it. \n \n \nRegarding the bolded.

I said you are an offense to true salvation and christianity, and if all of these people remain in this body then they are standing with you against the values which our savior stood for, and stands for today.

This isn't a matter of 'not letting gays in', as in, say, white-only rest rooms or gay-only water fountains. There needs to be more information here to make an informed opinion about this. My guess is that she chose not to take the case because she knew it would be against her religion, and I applaud her for doing that. After all, would you rather her have counseled the gay person and gone BY her religion, thereby telling them that gay relationships are wrong? I would think gay pride proponents would feel she did the RIGHT thing here. You say she shouldn't do something if her religion is a problem with it, but it seems to me that its very likely that's the position this counselor took by NOT counseling the person. And frankly, the college has its head in the sand if they think endorsing homosexual behavior is the status quo.\n \n \nYou are constitutionally protected to be able to practice whatever faith you choose, but your religious freedom ends at the tip of your nose. I, nor anyone else, is constitutionally obligated to give you an ear or a stage. You don't have the right to make your faith anyone esle's problem.\n\n \n I think a better such catch-phrase is to say one's religion ends at the limit of the range of his or her voice.\n Remember, religious people also have the full right to SHARE their religion and preach it if they so choose too. They are just as entitled to the marketplace of ideas as you are, and if you don't like their ideas then no one's forcing you to be persuaded. IOW, to use an analogy, it's rather your responsibility/problem to change the channel, rather than theirs to get off the air. They have just as much right to put their message out there as anyone else.\n \n \nIf your religion requires you to be a schmuck to gays, than a job requiring that you treat them/give them the same service as a heterosexual would be one you ought not to be applying for.\n\n \n Then I assume you feel she should have counseled the gay person and gone ahead and told them that their actions were wrong instead of letting someone else do the counseling for this patient? Interesting.\n I understand what you're saying. But when it comes to things like counseling services, this area gets a lot muddier than the way you're approaching it. \n \n \nSame as the Muslin who can't touch pork applying for a job in a meat packing plant. You ain't getting paid to be pretty (well most folks aren't), do your job or hit the road. And to think you were recently complaining about slackers.\n\n \n That would be a related example if not for the fact it's illegal.

I, nor anyone else, is constitutionally obligated to give you an ear or a stage. You don't have the right to make your faith anyone esle's problem. \n\n \n It's their problem now, because they're the ones getting sued.\n \n Some good examples of Christian rights in the workplace include the following, from ACLJ.org:\n \n 1. Title VII requires employers to accommodate employees who refuse to do specific tasks because of a conflict with religious beliefs. For instance, an employer has been required to accommodate a religious worker's objections to abortion.27 In that case, an Internal Revenue Service employee refused to handle applications for tax exempt status submitted by any organization which supported abortion. The court ruled that accommodating the employee would not result in undue hardship to the employer because the number of applications the employee might refuse to handle would be relatively insignificant as compared to his total workload.\n \n So employees who have a religious objection to abortion can request that their employer not require them to work on projects involving abortion. The employer will be required to grant this request if it can assign these projects to other employees without undue hardship.\n \n 2. An employee cannot be forced to speak in a manner that would violate his religion. For example, when an employee was fired for refusing, based on religious beliefs, to answer the telephone with \"Merry Christmas, Lesco,\" the court found that the employer should have accommodated the Jehovah's Witness employee's religious convictions regarding the observance of Christmas.28 The employer should have provided other ways for the employee to answer the phone or assigned her to a different task during the Christmas season.\n \n 3. An employee cannot be required to attend training that will violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. The EEOC has ruled that an employer violates Title VII if it requires an employee to attend training containing a philosophy that conflicts with the employee's religious beliefs.36 The EEOC found that the employer failed to show how accommodating the religious convictions of these employees by not requiring them to attend the training would result in an undue hardship.\n \n More in the links below:\n \n ACLJ : Christian Rights in the Workplace\n \n Answers to Common Questions about A Christian's Workplace Rights - FaithInTheWorkplace.com",

   "Lawmakers want university explanation for expulsion of Christian\n \n Lawmakers in Michigan are preparing to call on the carpet leaders of taxpayer-supported universities across the state after top officials at Eastern Michigan University expelled from a counseling program a Christian student who refused to argue in support of the homosexual lifestyle. \n \n As WND reported, trouble began for master's-program student Julea Ward when she refused to accept a client whose issue concerned a homosexual relationship.\n \n The school expelled her from the counseling program March 12, 2009, for refusing to abrogate her own personal religious beliefs and support the homosexual lifestyle. \n \n Since then, Ward has brought a lawsuit through the Alliance Defense Fund Center for Academic Freedom.\n \n Now members of the Michigan Senate have approved legislation that includes a provision calling on university counseling programs to evaluate and affirm how they can accommodate the religious beliefs of students. \n \n State Rep. Tom McMillin told WND (World Net Daily) the case was \"extremely alarming,\" and there was growing support for an effort to penalize universities that don't accomodate religious beliefs.\n \n Lawmakers want university explanation for expulsion of Christian\n \n Gays often criticize people of faith for being homophobic bigots, but there are scores of examples of the pro-homosexual community engaging in hate speech and acts of bigotry against Christians who have sincerely held Biblical beliefs.

   "If she wouldnt do her job then of course she is going to be fired. \n\n \n The law doesn't support your conclusion. People don't check their constitutional rights at the door when they walk into work, or school.\n \n Some good examples of Christian rights in the workplace include the following, from ACLJ.org:\n \n 1. Title VII requires employers to accommodate employees who refuse to do specific tasks because of a conflict with religious beliefs. For instance, an employer has been required to accommodate a religious worker's objections to abortion.27 In that case, an Internal Revenue Service employee refused to handle applications for tax exempt status submitted by any organization which supported abortion. The court ruled that accommodating the employee would not result in undue hardship to the employer because the number of applications the employee might refuse to handle would be relatively insignificant as compared to his total workload.\n \n So employees who have a religious objection to abortion can request that their employer not require them to work on projects involving abortion. The employer will be required to grant this request if it can assign these projects to other employees without undue hardship.\n \n 2. An employee cannot be forced to speak in a manner that would violate his religion. For example, when an employee was fired for refusing, based on religious beliefs, to answer the telephone with \"Merry Christmas, Lesco,\" the court found that the employer should have accommodated the Jehovah's Witness employee's religious convictions regarding the observance of Christmas.28 The employer should have provided other ways for the employee to answer the phone or assigned her to a different task during the Christmas season.\n \n 3. An employee cannot be required to attend training that will violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. The EEOC has ruled that an employer violates Title VII if it requires an employee to attend training containing a philosophy that conflicts with the employee's religious beliefs.36 The EEOC found that the employer failed to show how accommodating the religious convictions of these employees by not requiring them to attend the training would result in an undue hardship.\n \n More in the links below:\n \n ACLJ : ACLJ Gets NYC Housing Authority To Permit Prayer And Counseling In Public Housing Facility\n \n Answers to Common Questions about A Christian's Workplace Rights - FaithInTheWorkplace.com",
