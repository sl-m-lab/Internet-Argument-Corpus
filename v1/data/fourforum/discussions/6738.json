   "I am an avid scuba diver -- have been for almost 20 years.\n \n Anybody else out there a diver?\n\n \n *Raises flipper*\n \n I've done some Scuba diving, mainly when I was in Australia where I did an open water diving course. Living in the UK means its either a holiday hobby or necessary to brake out the dry suits! The diving I've done was on the Barrier Reef and at Byron Bay in Australia, St Abbs Head in th UK and Mombassa in Kenya.\n \n Saying that there is some fantasitc diving to be done around UK waters and the bits I've done I really enjoyed. If I were to do more I'd like to do some in NW Scotland which is well known around the world for its dive sites.\n \n I've got some great memories from the diving I've done, meeting sharks and Manta Rays being the most breathtaking and seeing 4 wobbegongs sleeping tail to mouth the most amusing.\n \n I'm also a fan of snokelling which I like as much as diving for different reasons- you could say I like both for the underwater wildlife and they both give different perspectives of the same world.\n \n How about you?",

   "I have been diving for years. Being from the US, almost all my diving has been in Central America and the Caribbean. I have attempted some cold water diving, but I couldn't get into it.

Isn&#8217;t the diving around the UK and Scotland dry suit diving?\n\n \n Yes, what I've done in Scotland required the use of dry suits. Thats a challenge in itself as it poses a whole new dimension to buoyancy control, and all the gear and weights that are needed do make it a bit of a chore at times. Still, once you are in the water all those niggles fade from memory and I enjoyed the dive for where I was and what I could see, not what equipment I needed to wear.\n \n \nFor me diving is a spiritual experience, so I do not like the confines of a wet suit and I carry as little &#8220;gear&#8221; with me as possible. I don&#8217;t take pictures or want souvenirs. I simply love the experience of being one with the ocean and the life in it.\n\n \n No, I'm not bothered about the souvenirs or pictures either, like yourself I enjoy diving to experience the underwater world. There is so much to see on a dive I couldn't imagine spending time messing around with cameras- you would miss so much.\n \n \nI am jealous that you have been to the Great Barrier Reef. It is one of the &#8220;must go&#8221; places I have on my list, but I need at least a month to make it worth while. When did you go? They say that some times of year are better than others.\n\n \n I was there in early November and the weather was good. Out of the three days out on the reef we had sun about 80% of the time and the temperature was okay too. I'd agree that you need a good amount of time to get the most out the experience, but I wouldn't limit yourself to the Great Barrier Reef only as there are many excellent diving areas on the East Coast- like Byron Bay I mentioned earlier. Diving at the Julian Rocks is an unforgettable experience! (my most memorable dives were made here).\n \n The next time I go down under for diving it will be to the Exmouth/Coral bay area on the northwest coast- this is has a great reputation as a diving area and I'm attracted by it being off the \"beaten track\" as well (plus the west coast of Australia is something wonderful itself!)",

   "OccamsRazor:\n \n Thanks for the info on Australia - I may have to make my trip even longer when I go! What was the water temperature like?\n \n If you ever decide to take a diving trip in the Caribbean, a must stop is Bonaire. You rent a truck park anywhere along the shore, swim about 50 meters and you are at a reef. It is a very quiet island with nothing to do but water sports - diving, snorkeling, windsurfing, etc. There are few sandy beaches, but it is ward and sunny all year long. Even in the hurricane season. A hurricane has not hit Bonaire since they have been keeping records. Surge from hurricanes that have passed to the north have affected the shore from time to time. You can dive in just swim shorts and your gear. The downside is that there are hardly any decent restaurants... but if you need to drop a few pounds...",

   "Water temperatures were around 27 degrees C (give or take) when I was on the Barrier Reef, so half length 3mm wetsuits were sufficent to keep one snug.\n \n Byron bay was cooler at 19 degrees C so you needed a full length 5mm wetsuit to keep the cold at bay.\n \n Bonaire sounds like its a watersports haven- are there any facilities there or do you need to take all the air you need with you? Whats the sealife like?",
