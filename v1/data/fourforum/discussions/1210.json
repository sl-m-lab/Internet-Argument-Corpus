It seems that CFC's are products contain a certain amount of chlorine in them which is proven to cause ozone depletion. That would mean that any other product released into the air that contains any amount of chlorine would also cause ozone depletion particularly if they were not washed back down to earth by rain. Bromine is another element which creates ozone depletion and is found in particals called halons used in fire extinguishers before 1993. The manufacturing of stryrofoam was also found to release ozone depleting chemicals into the air as well as volcanic eruptions and the burning of fossil fuels.\n \n This is what I could find during a quick search of the net. The one thing that I couldn't find that I would have liked to was a photo timeline of the ozone hole from the 1950's (estimated) to today. Anyways, I hope this is what you were looking for.",

The earth's natural flux lines cause electrons to travel back and forth between poles and when they interact with nitrogen and oxygen create nitrogen oxides which destroy O3. Since the magnetosphere is influenced by sun spot activity, there will be natural fluctuations in O3 levels as a result of these solar occurances.\n Unfortunately, many researchers focus only on one aspect of possible O3 destruction and attempt to ascribe a singular causal relationship when many exist in reality.",
