   "Woodward's book sounds very interesting. I've not read it yet, but I plan to pick it up soon. His last book, 'Bush at War,' is supposed to be pretty unbiased, from what I've heard. Already though, 'Plan of Attack' is raising a lot of issues. The relationship between Powell and Cheney, and especially what Woodward claims is Cheney's 'hawkish' attitude towards Iraq, is specially important. Powell has denied this already, so we don't really know. And the thing about the oil deal with the Saudis? Woodward has already denied making that allegation...seems no one told John Kerry that he didn't say that...oh well.\n \n Woodward's book raises some points which people should look at and think about, but they have to remember to take it with a grain of salt, just like what the Bush administration is saying in response.",

I commend them for wanting uncover the dirt in the Whitehouse.\n\n \n Clarke and Woodward are attacking the present White House biasly. They should be looking back a bit. Several of the claims made by each of these writers have been refuted by the people they wrote about.\n \n Call Sean some time and ask him how many times he's disagreed with what the Republicans do. You mentioned one of them already...drug costs for senior citizens. He's mentioned several issues before. Unlike the liberal propagandists, he does present both views. He invites liberals to be on his show so that he can expose their lack of ability to answer questions and their seeming lack of logic and fairness.\n \n I get news from:\n \n WSBradio\n \n Charlie Rose\n \n Frontline\n \n Firing Line\n \n Face the Nation\n \n PBS\n \n News Hour with Jim Lehrer\n \n BBC\n \n CNN\n \n http://www.orato.com/?src=overture\n \n http://news.search.yahoo.com/usns/ynsearch/categories/static/whatsnew.html\n \n http://www.theonion.com/\n \n http://news.com.com/\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/\n \n http://www.reuters.com/\n \n http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/\n \n http://nascar.8ir.com/\n \n http://www.lifenews.com/\n \n http://www.findarticles.com/PI/index.jhtml\n \n http://www.thesunlink.com/\n \n http://www.internet.com/sections/news.html\n \n http://www.mywn.com/\n \n \n and occasionally read the local rag.\n \n \n Where do you get yours?",
