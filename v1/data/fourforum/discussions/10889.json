   "Anti-Gay Activist David Parker Loses Appeal\n \n David Parker thinks his children should not be exposed in their school to any mention that gays and lesbians exist, let alone the fact that fellow pupils may have same-sex parents. The school district was using teaching materials that included references to gay families. He took it to court and lost twice. Now he wants to go to the Supreme Court to excise any information about gays families from school curricula.\n \n In the first loss, the judge had this to say:\n \n \nIn his 38-page decision, Chief Judge Mark L. Wolf of US District Court said that under the US Constitution, public schools are \"entitled to teach anything that is reasonably related to the goals of preparing students to become engaged and productive citizens in our democracy.\"\n \n \"Diversity is a hallmark of our nation,\" he said.\n\n \n In the appeal, which was decided unanimously against the plaintiff, the court said this:\n \n \n\"Public schools are not obliged to shield individual students from ideas which potentially are religiously offensive, particularly when the school imposes no requirement that the student agree with or affirm those ideas, or even participate in discussions about them,\" the court said in its ruling.\n\n \n Anti-gay activists demand not only the right not to live homosexual lifestyles themselves, which no-one is denying them, but the right to prevent others from living homosexual lifestyles (whatever the hell that might mean), and the right not to have their children made aware of such lifestyles. They want, in other words, to have gay families turned into non-persons, treated as if they were pariahs or didn't exist.\n \n I can't imagine that even the present Supreme Court would take this argument seriously. It would mean that any parent could dictate school curricula to suit their own prejudices. Children deserve better than to be brought up in religious closets.

Their parents can always home-school them if they mean to keep them innocent of real life.\n\n \n I support the right of persons to marry who they please, regardless of gender, and if it's only one other person. And I have no objection to teachers reading children books about other families with same gender parents. \n \n When you start spoon feeding *diversity studies* at that tender age, however, there are so many nuances to a teacher's communications, that, for the most part, I think many teachers wind up teaching prejudices. They just don't get it enough themselves. Yes, they're incompetent. My opinion here is based mostly on how teachers approach issues around race, for example, in classrooms, or other non-mainstream households, like single-parent homes. The teachers are so prejudiced themselves, and sometimes the *liberal* teachers are the worst because they have such an entrenched formulaic approach (that also revolves around how unprejudiced they are).\n \n The basic idea is in social studies. The child's view of the world is seen as gradually expanding from the primary care providers, the family, the neighborhood, the state, the nation, the world ... anyway .. you get the picture. Recall Piaget. The mind's expanding cognitive abilities.\n \n Well, for one, I don't find that children necessarily learn about the world in such a cut and dry manner, although there is some truth in the theory. Secondly, where you really run into problems is when teachers attempt to get children to assimilate these lessons by making their own families the subject of the lessons, and for their classmates. Where certainly there is a kernel of truth again. That is, the lesson gets brought home on another level. But what lesson really? Children are more complex as human beings than the school system and its teachers generally recognize.\n \n Here's the catch, IMHO. The American school system doesn't respect ANY families, period. Administrators, teachers, and chosen among parents .. we have goons and thugs running the show.\n \n So with the exception of a few unusual teachers (and they are few!), school districts violate family boundaries again and again (thereby violating children), some favored and blessed falling through those cracks, whatever that school's version of favored and blessed is, that is, who gets their (bleep) (bleeped). (Or sometimes just luck in walking through, invisibly enough at times, visibly at others, and surviving.)\n \n American education has become a veritable cesspool of cutthroat politics. \n \n Is it any surprise that millions are pulling their beloved children out, with many of those pulling being principals and teachers themselves.* \n \n I realize I diverge from the Constitutional issues, but, in the words of \"American education,\" just wanted to share.\n \n ----------\n \n * (And BTW, some are families with two parents of the same gender. Putting the religious right and gay rights families in a strange alliance -- but that's yet another topic.)",

Read this explanation for the other side of this issue.\n \n http://www.massresistance.org/docs/parker_lawsuit/appeal_loss_013108/index.html\n \n Federal court denies appeal in David Parker Civil Rights case on homosexual programs in elementary school.\n \n Appeals Judge issues outrageous ruling embracing homosexual \"tolerance\" lessons, ignoring Constitutional religious guarantees.\n \n Uses notorious \"1999 Curriculum Frameworks\" in argument.\n \n Parker's lawyers already preparing to appeal case to US Supreme Court\n \n \n Federal Appeals Judge Sandra L. Lynch, a Clinton appointee, wrote the opinion.\n BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS (JAN. 31, 2008) A three-judge federal appeals panel issued a bizarre and horrific ruling today denying the recent appeal by David Parker, his wife Tonia, and Rob and Robin Wirthlin in their federal Civil Rights case against the Lexington school system. The ruling, written Judge Sandra L. Lynch, upholds the dismissal of the case by Federal Judge Mark Wolf, agrees with his reasoning (with some minor exceptions) and even goes a bit further.\n \n Full text of ruling by First Circuit Court of \n Appeals (44 pages, Adobe Acrobat format)\n \n \n Strange legal reasoning\n \n Judge Lynch shows little interest in the major point made by Parker attorney Rob Sinsheimer that the basic Constitutional protections of religious belief are being trampled on by the school. Instead, she attempts to show how Massachusetts law makes it necessary. She digs pretty deep to do that. In her ruling references 1993 Massachusetts Education Reform Act as mandating that standards \"be designed to inculcate respect for the cultural, ethnic and racial diversity of the commonwealth.\" \n \n Lynch then uses the extremely controversial 1999 Comprehensive Health Curriculum Framework to justify homosexual-oriented \"tolerance\" lessons in the lower grades. She quotes from its \"measurable goals\" in the lower grades, such as \"define sexual orientation using the correct terminology.\" But Lynch completely ignores the fact that that document was clearly intended as a non-mandatory, informal set of guidelines. That is why Planned Parenthood has filed bill H597 this year to make that document a legal guideline, not informal. (Even the resources listed in the document are from the radical fringe.)\n \n Lynch also presents an interesting analysis of the state Parental Notification Law (Ch. 71, Sec. 32A) which succinctly explains that it is so watered down -- and is particularly compromised by the Department of Education's \"advisory rulings\" -- that it is essentially useless in this situation.\n \n Lynch then observes that the 2003 Goodridge decision held \"that the state constitution mandates the recognition of same-sex marriage\" and therefore, she implies, the schools must recognize it also.\n \n Most of the rest of Lynch's reasoning consists of a merry-go-round of excerpts from various \"case law\" decisions going back several years. That is always suspicious, as we've seen throughout this case, because one can cherry-pick language from past decisions (often out of context) almost forever. \n Banality of evil?\n \n From the text of ruling. To read these words is utterly mind-boggling. These judges see adults in public schools normalizing homosexuality to young children without their parents' knowledge or consent as merely a \"sensitive\" issue that the school has a perfect right to perform. To read the concluding words of Lynch's ruling is to experience a real sense of the term \"banality of evil\":\n \n First, as to the parents' free exercise rights, the mere fact that a child is exposed on occasion in public school to a concept offensive to a parent's religious belief does not inhibit the parent from instructing the child differently. A parent whose \"child is exposed to sensitive topics or information [at school] remains free to discuss these matters and to place them in the family's moral or religious context, or to supplement the information with more appropriate materials.\" (C.N., 430 F.3d at 185) . . . The parents here did in fact have notice, if not prior notice, of the books and of the school's overall intent to promote toleration of same-sex marriage, and they retained their ability to discuss the material and subject matter with their children. Our outcome does not turn, however, on whether the parents had notice.\n \n Turning to the children's free exercise rights, we cannot see how [The Parkers' son's] free exercise right was burdened at all: two books were made available to him, but he was never required to read them or have them read to him. Further, these books do not endorse gay marriage or homosexuality, or even address these topics explicitly, but merely describe how other children might come from families that look different from one's own. There is no free exercise right to be free from any reference in public elementary schools to the existence of families in which the parents are of different gender combinations.\n \n [The Wirthlin's son] has a more significant claim, both because he was required to sit through a classroom reading of King and King and because that book affirmatively endorses homosexuality and gay marriage. It is a fair inference that the reading of King and King was precisely intended to influence the listening children toward tolerance of gay marriage. That was the point of why that book was chosen and used. Even assuming there is a continuum along which an intent to influence could become an attempt to indoctrinate, however, this case is firmly on the influence-toward-tolerance end. There is no evidence of systemic indoctrination. There is no allegation that Joey was asked to affirm gay marriage. Requiring a student to read a particular book is generally not coercive of free exercise rights.\n \n Public schools are not obliged to shield individual students from ideas which potentially are religiously offensive, particularly when the school imposes no requirement that the student agree with or affirm those ideas, or even participate in discussions about them. . . The reading of King and King was not instruction in religion or religious beliefs. . .\n \n On the facts, there is no viable claim of \"indoctrination\" here. Without suggesting that such showings would suffice to establish a claim of indoctrination, we note the plaintiffs' children were not forced to read the books on pain of suspension. Nor were they subject to a constant stream of like materials. There is no allegation here of a formalized curriculum requiring students to read many books affirming gay marriage. . . The reading by a teacher of one book, or even three, and even if to a young and impressionable child, does not constitute \"indoctrination.\"\n \n Because plaintiffs do not allege facts that give rise to claims of constitutional magnitude, the district court did not err in granting defendants' motion to dismiss the claims under the U.S. Constitution.\n \n Public schools often walk a tightrope between the many competing constitutional demands made by parents, students, teachers, and the schools' other constituents. . . The balance the school struck here does not offend the Free Exercise or Due Process Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.\n \n We do not suggest that the school's choice of books for young students has not deeply offended the plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs. If the school system has been insufficiently sensitive to such religious beliefs, the plaintiffs may seek recourse to the normal political processes for change in the town and state. See Smith, 494 U.S. at 890. They are not entitled to a federal judicial remedy under the U.S. Constitution. We affirm the district court's dismissal with prejudice of plaintiffs' federal claims and its dismissal without prejudice of the state claims so that they may be reinstated, should plaintiffs choose, in state court.\n \n [From Wikipedia: The Banality of Evil is a phrase coined in 1963 by Hannah Arendt in her work Eichmann in Jerusalem. It describes the thesis that the great evils in history generally, and the Holocaust in particular, were not executed by fanatics or sociopaths but rather by ordinary people who accepted the premises of their state and therefore participated with the view that their actions were normal.]\n \n \n On to the US Supreme Court\n \n Jeffrey Denner, of Denner Pelligrino in Boston and lead attorney of David Parker's legal team, announced that they are immediately preparing to go before the US Supreme Court on this case. \"We are fully committed to go forward,\" he said today. \"We will continue to fight on all the fronts that we need to.\"\n \n Remembering the famous St. Patrick's Boston Parade case in the mid 1990's, Parker said that he is not at all discouraged. In that case, known as the Hurley case, an openly homosexual group wanted to march in the South Boston St. Patrick's Day Parade, but the organizers refused to allow them. With the help of the liberal legal establishment the group sued -- and won -- claiming that the parade was a \"public accommodation\" and may not discriminate. Famed pro-family attorney Chester Darling, arguing the case pro-bono for the parade organizers, kept appealing the case and lost on the local, state, and federal level 17 times. Finally, the US Supreme Court heard the case and eventually ruled 9-0 in favor of the parade organizers -- that the parade's freedom of speech trumps political correctness!\n \n \"This ruling will surely embolden and enable the schools even more on this if it's not fought,\" said Parker. \"There's going to be an accountability, you can count on it.\"",

   "In David Parker Case:\n Schools' legal brief outlines legal arguments for forcing homosexual indoctrination in schools across America.\n \n http://www.massresistance.org/docs/parker_lawsuit/appeal_2007/final_briefs.html\n \n Presenting the arguments before the Federal Court of Appeals:\n \n Major pro-homosexual groups and Lexington school system file briefs to stop appeal of David Parker's federal civil rights suit.\n \n At issue: Homosexuality in elementary schools vs the rights of parents.\n \n (See briefs and other filings below)\n \n When the 3-judge Federal Appeals Court panel convenes on Wednesday, Dec. 5 to hear the oral arguments from both sides on David Parker's federal civil rights suit -- to effectively decide if this will be allowed to go to trial -- they'll have had plenty to digest.\n \n This case is brings to the light of day (1) how obsessed the homosexual movement is with reaching your children, and what lengths they're willing to go to do it; and (2) how strongly school systems believe that they supercede the family when it comes to defining values to children - even if the families object.\n \n The best synopsis of all this is in the final rebuttal brief by the Parkers' attorneys (listed below - it's also the shortest - 10 pages). It describes the absurd twists that the pro-homosexual groups and the school system are taking to try to make the case that teaching homosexuality to young children should be mandated and protected.\n \n Essentially, the school system and their allies are using these legal tactics:\n \n Claiming that the Parkers and Wirthlins want to dictate the curriculum.\n Using the Brown decision in Chelmsford from 1995 (see below) as a reason they should prevail.\n Using other obscure \"case law\" regarding \"hybrid rights\", etc., to assert the rights of the schools over parents.\n Claiming that \"diversity\" is mandated by law and precedent, which includes homosexuality.\n All of these tactics are absurd, and in a normal courtroom would have no bearing on this case. \n Here's what's been filed for this appeal from both sides:\n \n (All documents are in Adobe Acrobat/PDF format)\n \n 1. Office Notice of Appeal, by Parker's attorneys.\n \n Filed in February, immediately after Judge Wolf's ruling was released.\n \n 2. Notice of appearance by:\n Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network;\n Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays;\n Gay and Lesbian Advocates & Defenders\n \n Filed last summer, their intent to submit a brief. These are three of the most aggressive homosexual groups:\n \n GLSEN - Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network\n Very powerful national homosexual group targeting children in schools. This is the group that organizes the horrific \"Gay-straight alliance\" clubs, homosexual school assemblies, the \"Day of Silence\" in schools around the country, and annual GLSEN conferences pushing the most extreme homosexual topics and issues on vulnerable kids. \n \n PFLAG - Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays\n Also in public schools around the country, and in many ways even more destructive than GLSEN. Very heavy into transgenderism and related behaviors. Recent PFLAG conference also teamed up with the \"New England Leather Alliance\" which promotes bondage and sado-machosism.\n \n GLAD - Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders\n Well-funded and influential Massachusetts homosexual legal group (partially funded from public money) which specializes in suing government agencies and businesses to force them to accept homosexuality, transgenderism, public sex, and related behaviors. This was the group behind the Goodridge decision on same-sex \"marriage\" and pushing the new \"transgender rights and hate crimes\" bill.\n \n Also, this past summer GLAD bragged in their newsletter how they're using their resources to pursue the Parker case and stop parents' rights. Read it here: \"Keeping schools safe for LGBT families.\"\n \n 3. Parkers' introductory brief explaining the reasons for their appeal. (64 pages).\n \n The brief gets right to the heart of the problem in attacking Judge Wolf's decision to dismiss the case. It makes five major points:\n \n The public schools chose to intentionally indoctrinate very young children into disbelieving core tenets of their established religious faith.\n This case is not dictated by the infamous \"Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer\" case in the 1990's, as the defendants claim, and the lower court improperly applied a certain \"rights\" principle in its decision.\n The Massachusetts Civil Rights Act was violated.\n The school does not have immunity from this lawsuit.\n An argument can be made that the school's actions constitute a \"civil conspiracy\" against the plaintiffs.\n The brief also directly attacks Judge Wolf's incredibly offensive decision that schools have not only a right but an obligation to push homosexuality in young children for the good of society. For example, Wolf says in his ruling (among other things):\n \n As it is difficult to change attitudes and stereotypes after they have developed, it is reasonable for public schools to attempt to teach understanding and respect for gays and lesbians to young students in order to minimize the risk of damaging abuse in school of those who may be perceived to be different.\n \n But this is clearly unconstitutional, as Parker's lawyers' point out:\n \n This open acknowledgment of an intention to change plaintiffs' faith is unconstitutional . . . Contrary to the views of the defendants and the District Court, a public school has no right to change children's minds about their deeply held faith, particularly in the private areas of marriage and procreation.\n \n 4. Lexington schools' [defendants'] brief rebutting Parker's brief (76 pages).\n \n This goes through an exhaustive and tedious rebuttal of each of the points brought out in Parker's brief, plus more. It relies heavily on attempting to apply so-called \"case law\", particularly the Brown case, to this one.\n \n 5. Amicus brief by five national homosexual groups, plus Women's Bar Association (50 pages).\n \n This brief was submitted by six groups, including three mentioned above: Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), Greater Boston Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network (GLSEN).\n \n Also included are Human Rights Campaign (HRC), Human Rights Campaign Foundation, and the Women's Bar Association ( WBA). The \"Human Rights Campaign\" is arguably the richest and most powerful homosexual advocacy group in the country. It's funded by dozens of major corporations, including Staples, Verizon, American Airlines, and many more. At their fundraiser in Boston last fall, Deval Patrick (now Governor of Massachusetts) and Boston Mayor Tom Menino were keynote speakers.\n \n The Women's Bar Association was originally formed in the 1970s to \"fight discrimination\" in the workplace and probably most female lawyers in Massachusetts belong to it. However, it has morphed into a very radical, anti-family organization that uses its clout to push legislation in the State House.\n \n This brief \"complements\" the brief by the defendants by going into more radical \"legal theory\" and \"challenges of diversity\" to support the claims that the normalization and acceptance homosexuality MUST be taught in society. It also attempts to legally \"prove\" that there is no constitutional right of parents to opt their children out of such teachings.\n \n 6. Amicus brief by ACLU, Teachers unions, and others - 6 groups. (37 pages)\n 7. Appendix to above brief (41 pages)\n \n Submitted by the national American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA - the state's teachers' union), Lexington Education Association (the local chapter of the MTA).\n \n Also included are \"Lexington Community Action for Responsible Community Action and Safety\" and \"Respecting Differences\" - both of which appear to be phony local front groups.\n \n This was submitted as one brief, but we divided them for ease of handling. Although very boring and tedious to plow through, they are interesting because they show the bizarre lengths one can go to use the minutiae of \"case law\" (along with other sources) to \"prove\" any claims imaginable. It really is frightening to see the most ridiculous points which they use to deconstruct the rights of parents to raise their own children by lifting bits and pieces of past court decisions out of context. \n \n Using \"case law\" this way is not only technically unconstitutional in Massachusetts, but also is a huge flaw in the way the American justice system works. One can see how the ACLU is able to ride roughshod over America\n \n 8. Amicus brief by Anti-Defamation League (ADL) (27 pages)\n \n This brief uses \"case law\" and various other sources to attempt to make two points:\n \n The state has a strong interest in normalizing homosexual relationships (\"respecting different types of people and families\"); and\n The public schools are entitled to teach any subject that is reasonably related to a legitimate state interest.\n Both of these points are absurd and offensive. But that didn't stop the ADL.\n \n Traditionally one would think of the ADL as being primarily concerned with dealing with anti-Semitism. But in recent decades they've spent too much of their resources pushing radical politics -- and have recently taken some heat in the Jewish press about that (even from us). They need to go back to doing what they're supposed to be doing.\n \n 9. Parker's final response to defendants' brief and amicus briefs. (10 pages)\n \n This final brief sums it up best. If you decide to read only one of them, this is the one worth reading. The main points it brings up are:\n \n The state's interest in diversity is a \"red herring\".\n Plaintiffs do not seek to dictate curriculum.\n The amici and the defendants unfairly seek to discredit the establishment clause.\n Plaintiff parents are the only appropriate guardians of their own children's rights.\n The school system is placing an unreasonable burden on the parents.\n Parker's lawyers also point out that the amici briefs tend to use specious outside sources to \"prove\" their assertions about parents' rights and the rights of the state over its citizens.\n \n 10. Oral argument schedule.\n \n This was sent by court to all the attorneys. Note that ACLU attorneys are included. Not only does the ACLU (and probably others) support the defendants with briefs, but they actually work side by side with them in the case. The ACLU lawyers were present before judge at the Motion to Dismiss hearing last February.",

   "I support the right of persons to marry who they please, regardless of gender, and if it's only one other person. And I have no objection to teachers reading children books about other families with same gender parents. \n\n \n I can't understand why anyone would have an objection to that, but obviously many Christians do.\n \n \nWhen you start spoon feeding *diversity studies* at that tender age, however, there are so many nuances to a teacher's communications, that, for the most part, I think many teachers wind up teaching prejudices. They just don't get it enough themselves. Yes, they're incompetent. My opinion here is based mostly on how teachers approach issues around race, for example, in classrooms, or other non-mainstream households, like single-parent homes. The teachers are so prejudiced themselves, and sometimes the *liberal* teachers are the worst because they have such an entrenched formulaic approach (that also revolves around how unprejudiced they are).\n\n \n Well, all that's being taught here is that there is diversity in families. That is simply a fact. Do you suggest schools pretend it isn't a fact?\n \n\n The basic idea is in social studies. The child's view of the world is seen as gradually expanding from the primary care providers, the family, the neighborhood, the state, the nation, the world ... anyway .. you get the picture. Recall Piaget. The mind's expanding cognitive abilities.\n\n \n Yes indeed, which is why educating them at this time is a good idea.\n \n \nWell, for one, I don't find that children necessarily learn about the world in such a cut and dry manner, although there is some truth in the theory. Secondly, where you really run into problems is when teachers attempt to get children to assimilate these lessons by making their own families the subject of the lessons, and for their classmates. Where certainly there is a kernel of truth again. That is, the lesson gets brought home on another level. But what lesson really? Children are more complex as human beings than the school system and its teachers generally recognize.\n\n \n The reality is that children's families are diverse. You advocate pretending they aren't?\n \n \nHere's the catch, IMHO. The American school system doesn't respect ANY families, period. Administrators, teachers, and chosen among parents .. we have goons and thugs running the show.\n\n \n Oh dear, this is just a pathetic denunciation of public schools. How predictable.\n \n \nSo with the exception of a few unusual teachers (and they are few!), school districts violate family boundaries again and again (thereby violating children), some favored and blessed falling through those cracks, whatever that school's version of favored and blessed is, that is, who gets their (bleep) (bleeped). (Or sometimes just luck in walking through, invisibly enough at times, visibly at others, and surviving.)\n \n American education has become a veritable cesspool of cutthroat politics. \n \n Is it any surprise that millions are pulling their beloved children out, with many of those pulling being principals and teachers themselves.\n \n \n It's a tiny fraction. And if people want to hide the real world from the children, is that really good parenting? I don't think so.",

It just isn't there.\n\n \n Hi steeeeve, Here is an example of how when a question of rights arises between the people and the Government as stated in the ninth amendment of the Constitution. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution , the people's rights are paramount as is explained below. They are unenumerated rights of the Parents to maintain control over their minor children's moral influences. That is a natural right and in no other generation would the Government even consider imposing on it. And I must say that I am absolutely shocked that you disagree with my stance even it it wasn't the 9th amendment, but has always been a God given right of parents over their children's upbringing.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unenumerated_rights\n Unenumerated rights\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Unenumerated rights are sometimes defined as legal rights inferred from other legal rights that are officialized in a retrievable form codified by law institutions, such as in written constitutions, but are not themselves expressly coded or \"enumerated\" among the extant writ of the law. [1] Alternative terminology sometimes used are: natural rights, background rights, and fundamental rights. [2]\n Unenumerated rights may alternatively refer to a situation when an individual or group of people delegate limited powers to a government. When limited powers are delegated, then necessarily there must remain residual rights in the individual or the group of people. James Madison was a champion of this residual theory of unenumerated rights. In his speech introducing the Bill of Rights in the United States Congress, Madison explained, \"the constitution is a bill of powers, the great residuum being the rights of the people.\"[3] Likewise, in a letter to George Washington, Madison wrote: \"If a line can be drawn between the powers granted and the rights retained, it would seem to be the same thing, whether the latter be secured by declaring that they shall not be abridged, or that the former shall not be extended.\"[4]\n Unenumerated rights may be actual rights insofar as they necessitate the systematization of positively enumerated rights anywhere laws would become logically incoherent, or could not be adhered to or maintained in the exclusion of those unenumerated items as rights. Examples of this include federal systems where constituent member constitutions have to be interpreted in relation to their membership in the federal whole, adjudicative of whether authority is rightfully devolved or more rightly federative.[5]\n This term alternatively, is used loosely to mean any perceived rights, often considered peremptory or intuitively fiat (such as God-given rights innate to each individual or inherent to mankind),[6] that are without expression or instance of articulation & without consideration of the necessity to their existence extrapolated from the logical unity of other positive rights.\n Article 40.3 of the Constitution of Ireland & the Ninth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution both reference & account for the recognition of unenumerated rights by their respective governments.\n I submit the bolded as evidence that a parents rights over the moral indoctrination of their own children is absolutely theirs alone and God given.",

Therefore the school has no right to instill its brand of morality on children whom they aren't raising or taking personal responsibility for. And you know very well that they don't.\n \n So here's my point jito, I don't care what parents teach their own children regarding their moral foundation, as long as it is the parents teaching it to them, and not strangers in an impersonal school setting who have an agenda that doesn't consider the children's long term emotional welfare in any way.

Although I think there are problems particularly in the early childhood *diversity* curriculum, and, how it's handled by many teachers, as I also mentioned. Whereby children walk away with more prejudices instead, IMO. And sometimes being more alienated. My concerns are rather different than the community of persons (i.e. religious right) that you refer to.\n \n I also think, however, parents (even the religious right!) do have certain rights, even if I don't agree with that parent as to how they raise their children.

There are important developmental issues involving parents as well as children. Seperation issues. I am not an advocate of our more popular American system of simply grabbing children and throwing parents out the door.

The Constitution bans from grabbing power to deny people their rights. \n \n Try to stay on track for once.\n\n \n It wasn't a loaded question at all. It was a very clearly written direct question that was designed to get a straight answer from steeeeve as to his personal opinion on this issue of parental rights over what material is disseminated to their minor children. So it's only loaded to someone who doesn't want to answer it. Here is the WHOLE question I asked steeeeve for those who want to read it, not the edited version you quoted.\n \n \nSo let me get this straight here. Are you saying that in your opinion, it is right and valid for strangers who have no REAL personal investment or interest in the long term emotional health of minor children, should have the authority that supersedes those rights of the child's parents to protect them from teachings that the parents believe the children are too young to be told about? You don't see it as a valid God given right for parents to be able to limit what sexual information is disseminated to their minor children by the Government funded public schools they attend? As a strict Constitutionalist, are you really telling me you believe that to be the case?\n",

   "No, I stated earlier that I do not have an objection. Although I think there are problems particularly in the early childhood *diversity* curriculum, and, how it's handled by many teachers, as I also mentioned. Whereby children walk away with more prejudices instead, IMO. And sometimes being more alienated. My concerns are rather different than the community of persons (i.e. religious right) that you refer to.\n\n \n Well, there are potentially \"problems\" with any curriculum and how it is taught -- those are usually resolvable with appropriate teacher training. However, diversity is a fact. In the particular school in question, apparently there were several kids with two gay parents, or single parents. The mom-and-pop-and-two-point-five-kids nuclear family is no longer even the norm in many places.\n \n \nI also think, however, parents (even the religious right!) do have certain rights, even if I don't agree with that parent as to how they raise their children. And that there are areas rightfully outside the domain of the public school system -- and that the burden placed thus -- also serves the interests of the schools and communities.\n \n \n Well, the issue here is not what the parents teach their own children, but how the school handles the fact of family diversity. One curriculum or another might be problematic, but having no policy or curriculum in place is arguably even worse.\n \n \nIt's not a perfect arrangement, but I don't think the schools should be taking over every aspect of families' lives or choices in how their children are educated.\n\n \n Schools teach values. They can't help it. Any school is going to teach values merely by trying to teach. Adults and peers all serve as examples of moral behaviour to growing kids. Learning to live peacefully in a diverse group of people is not \"taking over every aspect of families' lives\" -- it's one of the things schools naturally do. They can't teach in a moral vacuum.\n \n \nRemember, too, this was a kindergarten class. There are important developmental issues involving parents as well as children. Seperation issues. I am not an advocate of our more popular American system of simply grabbing children and throwing parents out the door. And, this is a pretty off-the-cuff observation of the parents' photo, but they don't strike me as the kind of parents used to getting their way with the district because of \"who they are.\"\n\n \n It's wonderful for parents to be involved in their children's school education -- within limits. It can go overboard when parents try to dictate to teachers every aspect of what their child may or may not learn. Those kids live in a diverse world, with gay people and gay families. They may as well get used to it from an early age.\n \n \nSo, with the exception of the political issues here -- the organizations and the lawsuit -- if the parents weren't initially part of all that -- I ask whether the school might have handled it differently.\n \n I don't have an issue with what the court decided. Just that the school didn't necessarily show off their skills as educators.\n\n \n As you say, it's a kindergarten. The father always had the option of withdrawing his child. He had the option of private schooling. Maybe the school could have handled it better, though as far as I know it did its utmost to accommodate the guy, but I think the father had a political agenda of his own.",

And it's all state funded.\"\n -Brockton resident who attended.\n \n \"This is a relatively good political climate for us right now\".\n - Jason Smith, Commission Chairman.\n \n BROCKTON, MASSACHUSETTS (MONDAY, DEC. 17, 2007) The state-funded Massachusetts Commission on Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgender (\"GLBT\") Youth met in Brockton and outlined their bold plans for pushing homosexuality and transgenderism further into Massachusetts schools in 2008. They described how they are intimidating local school officials who resist, holding training sessions for school-based homosexual activists, and organizing the GSA clubs to \"normalize\" these behaviors throughout the school. They held a special \"closed\" meeting earlier in the day to discuss this with student \"leaders\" from several local schools.\n Here is what can only be described as them laying out their agenda:\n Some of the general topics discussed:\n \n Their \"High School Committee\" chairman emphasized what we've been seeing ourselves: They're pushing hard to put homosexual and transgender programs in the lower grades, not only in high school. There seems to be an obsession with normalizing homosexuality to kids as young as possible.\n They are also conducting \"Youth bisexual talks\" at some colleges and universities - apparently through \"religious communities\" on campus.\n They discussed their plans to put huge efforts into lobbying for the \"Transgender rights and hate crimes bill\" (H1722) coming up early next year in the Legislature. They have a special committee to focus on individual lawmakers. This seems to be a big priority. Most likely, they will make extensive use of kids.\n The homosexual group MassEquality made a presentation at the meeting. The Commission plans to work with them (and presumably get kids involved) to expand homosexual \"marriage\" throughout the New England states.\n They want a better distribution of state money for homosexual programs in schools. Not enough of it is getting into the schools, they complained. A representative from the Mass. Dept. of Education gave a presentation of how they've been working with the Commission to more efficiently give out the \"grant\" money to GSA clubs in the schools.\n The \"Human Services Committee\" chairman reported that they are now targeting state agencies to make sure they're homosexual and transgender friendly. They are sending letters to introduce work of Commission and lining up families of LGBT youth to \"dialogue\" with agency employees. They especially want to target DSS Youth Services.\n One of the committee leaders started a huge discussion on making sure that the Commission includes enough bisexual committee members. \"Bisexuals were being left out of this whole process,\" members were told. So there was a big debate back and forth. If finally came down to the difficulty of asking people what their \"orientation\" is. But still, there was concern of several members of lack of bisexual representation. (Don't get us started . . .)\n The chairman, Jason Smith, told the Commission that there is no Massachusetts residency requirement to be a member.\n Very weird new Commission members were voted in.\n \n Here are the new Commission members voted in on Dec 17th 2007- does this look like a cross section of our community? But these are the people who will be working with our grammar school age children in Massachusetts.\n Below is the list of biographies of the new Commission members which was compiled by the Commission's nominating committee.On Dec. 17, 2007, the entire slate of candidates was voted.

Of the 12, we are forwarding 11 to the Commission for approval. The selected applicants represent a diverse group of individuals bringing a range of skills to the Commission and its work. Their appointment will increase the number of commissioners representing communities of color, the transgender community, and youth.\n \n The slate below is presented for your approval. Once approved, the nominations committee will conduct final reference checks before finalizing the regional appointments. * represent nominees who submitted their own biographies. \n [Biographies]\n \n Doug Bounds - a recent graduate of Worcester Vocational High School and member of SWAGLY, Doug is interested in expanding the number of community youth groups for GLBT youth.\n \n *Edward Byrne - Ed Byrne is Managing Director and President of the Board at Project 10 East, Inc.- a Boston based non-profit orgar~izations pecializing in helping to create and sustain gay-straight alliances in MA schools. He is also Project Manager at Sametz Blackstone Associates, a brand-focused communications consultancy in the South End of Boston. Ed began working for Project 10 East in 2005 as a part-time program manager while in college. In this capacity he worked in schools every week building gay-straight alliances with students and coaching faculty and administrators on how to make their school a safe place for GLBT youth. In 2005-2006 he was the organization's liaison to the Boston XXXXX Youth Providers Group and to the task force that developed Boston communication strategy to the ex-gay movement. He has given numerous workshops and participated on panels for high schools and colleges on topics such as coming out, youth leadership, the GSA movement, and community organizing. At Sametz Blackstone he responsible for the coordination of communications strategy and design projects for some of Boston's most respected non-profit organizations including Brigham and Women's Hospital, New England Foundation for the Arts, and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. He is graduate of St. John's Prep in Danvers, MA and a 2007 graduate of Harvard University where he received his Bachelor's degree in Social Science Studies with a concentration in Political Philosophy.\n \n *Abigail Carpenter-Winch - My name is Abigail Carpenter-Winch, and I am a junior at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. I am from Cambridge, MA. I would like to join the Commission because I want to be able to help make important decisions concerning the safety of GLBT youth in Massachusetts. I am involved with several organizations that work to do this (such as the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network and the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition), and I believe that my experience will make a valuable contribution to the Commission.\n \n *Kenneth Garber - Thank you in advance for consideration of my application to the Massachusetts Commission on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth. My name is Kenneth Garber I have been a member of the Waltham Fire Department for 27 1/2 years. I'm a member of Greater Boston PFLAG, MTPC and Dignity Boston. My wife Marcia and I are the parents of a 19 year old transgendered male. My son CJ is a freshman at Lasell College studying Criminal Justice. CJ underwent a double mastectomy in the summer of 2006 and a total Laproscopic hysterectomy this past summer. During this past summer I have been witness to how difficult it is for trans people to make changes to various documents and also to harsh treatment we received from various agencies. I applied to the Commission because I know how difficult it is for trans people and their families to deal with the issue and people involved. I hope that some of our experiences will allow me to help other transgendered people and their families to get through some difficult times. I'm going to try and attend tomorrow evening good luck to all the candidates.\n \n Michael McDonald - Michael, currently a high school student, founded his school's GSA.\n \n *Alex Morse - My name is Alex Morse. I grew up in Holyoke, Massachusetts and I am currently a freshman at Brown University studying Community Health and Political Science. -Throughout my high school career, I founded my school's Gay Straight Alliance, and as the group's president I organized the school's first ever school-wide assembly on GLBTQ issues. In addition, I conducted my school's first ever faculty training on homophobia and the creation of safe spaces and classes. Within the community, I founded the Holyoke GLBTQ Taskforce, an organization of youth and adults dedicated to making the city a safer place for GLBTQ people. With this organization, I planned the 1st Annual Western Mass Youth Pride Prom for high school age young people in Western Mass. As for my time at Brown, I was recently elected the Finance Chair of the school's XXXXX Alliance and co-chair of the XXXXX Community Committee.\n \n *Rhiannon O'Donnabhain - Rhiannon O'Donnabhain is a lesbian transgender woman. She grew up in a close-knit Irish Catholic family on Boston's South Shore. In the 1960's Rhiannon went into military service after college, enlisting in the Coast Guard. She later worked in construction and as an engineer, in both the public and private sector. Born anatomically male, Rhiannon began having conflicted feelings about her gender identity in elementary school. Rhiannon tried hard to fit into the male role-to do \"masculine\" things. She married and parented three children. But her strong sense that she was a woman persisted. After her marriage ended in 1992, she began seeing a therapist who evaluated her and diagnosed her with gender identity disorder (GID), a persistent conflict between a person's birth sex and their gender identity. GID is a recognized medical condition requiring medical care in severe cases. In 2001, after she and her health care providers determined that surgery was critical to enable her to live her life as a woman, she underwent several surgeries as part of her course of transition. With GLAD, Rhiannon is suing the IRS, arguing that the medical expenses relating to her transition were for medical care, and therefore deductible. As a Commissioner, she seeks to: advance the rights of LGBTQ youth through education and public policy changes; provide legal information to youth, legal advocates, and activists; and, advocate for policies and legislation that protect and support LGBTQ youth.\n \n *Marta Rivera Paczvnska - Marta Rivera Paczynska is a Ph.D. candidate in English at Tufts, working on a dissertation that explores intersections of family, sexuality, race, and national identity in 20th century anglophone Puerto Rican literature. She is 31, a Puerto Rican woman of mixed ancestry, and identifies as a butch and a XXXXX woman of color. She has served on several university committees, is helping organize a Women's Studies conference, and volunteers in the community. She has taught college first-year classes discussing gender identity, sexuality, and race. She spoke at the rallies and testified at the hearings that helped create the Governor's Commission.\n \n *Kirsten Steinbach - I have been involved - directly or indirectly - with the Commission since the spring semester of 2005, when I was introduced to it by Alex Morash.[...] Since then I have actively participated or participate in several organizations as well as done individual proactivist work with this community and other communities (\"other\" including environmentallconservation work, human rights, etc.). These organizations include, but are not limited to (in no particular order): Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition, MassEquality, Freedom to Marry Coalition, Safe Homes, Supporters of Worcester Area GLBT Youth (SWAGLY), and the College and Young Adult Committee of the Governor's Commission on GLBT Youth, as well as volunteering at Youth and Boston Pride. Other work I have done as an individual proactivist include educating individuals on polyamory, transgenderlgenderqueerlqueer issues, safe space, marriage equality, and pansexuality; being safe space for all people (everyone is celebrated with me); and lobbying state and federal legislators and officials to enact laws and policies that affirm our identities (including non-discrimination laws, hate crimes legislation, and transgender-affirming policies and procedures, etc.).\n \n *Rich Vaden - I am a nineteen-year-old senior at Simons Rock College in Great Barrington Massachusetts. Ever since I came out, I have looked to the gay rights movement for a sense of solidarity, support and guidance. Though I sometimes feel included, more often I feel ignored and even rejected because the issues I care about are considered \"third rail\" of the movement. I believe there are many more important issues within the gay community than gay marriage and adoption rights. What about issues related to gay youths? Every day, hundreds of gay adolescents come out to their friends and families and are immediately thrown out onto the street or are held captive in their homes. How are we addressing their needs? Though I have been frustrated by ,the movement's almost complete ignorance of gay youths, my frustration has turned me into a staunch gay activist. When I went to college, I joined my campus GSA, The Human Rights Campaign, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Now, I am the president of our GSA and I am writing my ser~iotrh esis on the formation of the gay identity, with specific focus on gay youth. I bring a great deal of thought and passion to my work as an activist, and I hope I am granted the opportunity to work on these and other issues on the Massachusetts Governor's Commission on GLBT Youth.\n \n Armando Velez Ill - a student at Framingham State College interested in building networks to support GLBT college",

   "And I must ask why a special interest group with its own agenda is determining the curriculum our K-12 students are subjected to just because they add the word education in their name and imply that they represent both sides?\n \n After all, this is the 20th anniversary of their founding yet none of the so called sensitivity training they have been promoting in our schools for years has had no effect on real school violence at all, now has it? And yet when violence occurs, the authorities and media always look at the failures of the Parents, but never these groups who work within the schools directly with the children on just these issues from k-12 with the NEAs approval and State funding.\n \n This is why i say in the posts above that groups which have no real investment in the emotional stability or personal security of the children they disseminate their sexually charged info to have no right to take such open ended authority over the inherent rights of the parents if they aren't willing to also take responsibility for their total and complete failures within the school system. \n \n So the Parkers complaint isn't about a Gay Free Environment at all lesz, but is about parental control over what their minor children are exposed to by people who aren't then willing to take real responsibility for the outcomes of such programs.\n \n http://www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/all/about/index.html",

   "Well, there are potentially \"problems\" with any curriculum and how it is taught -- those are usually resolvable with appropriate teacher training. \n\n \n I can't say I agree. For one, I think some teaching issues concern teachers' life experiences -- which training can't provide or supplant. Secondly, some of the curriculum is just poor. For example, I saw a lesson plan once whereby the class was basically being told, if you are an only child, that is a sad and lonely experience. Only children were being told their families were inferior in a way, they were less than, and, the lesson was shaming them. Now, a teacher with a modicum of life experience (as well as training) could have made an independent judgment about that lesson plan, tweaked, and adjusted it accordingly. On the other hand, most teachers IMO would likely have swallowed it as a truism -- about families with only children -- and deliver the message to the students as obedient servants of the American education system.\n \n I spoke with a child, once, who came out of a diversity lesson with the understanding that it was BETTER to be \"white\" and a very sad thing to be \"black\" in our society. I spoke with another child who was taught they were a different race, and later heard that the problem was the parent because most children \"know by age five what they are\" ....\n \n So teacheth some diversity educators ... what you are ...\n \n Now, on the other hand, to the credit of diversity education, I once saw a tape whereby a very talented young teacher gave a great lesson on gay families mostly by supporting a child who was sharing their family story with their classmates. Clearly the child was comfortable, the teacher was tuned in, and, had the support of the child's family, and the class was fascinated. They were somewhere in the 3rd-5th grade range if I remember correctly. \n \n That lesson, you could see though, clearly came out of that teacher and his specific group, not some formulaic curriculum about diversity that gets sent out across the country to all kinds of communities and is regurgitated by standardized teachers who have no personal experience with these issues. Where now every child in the classroom gives a little performance, not because they want to, but because it's a requirement, and there's no real understanding on the part of the teacher, no real involvement by families, no real support. Just an act, with the real lesson now, that these five kids (with mom, pop, brothers and sisters, babies, beautiful house photos, dog, cat, horses, expensive furniture, etc. etc.) -- are the best -- and so and so from this poor home or that one -- is much worse off, and, less than ...\n \n It becomes a competition judged by a different standards. It's about conformity and your place in life, according to the American education system.\n \n \nHowever, diversity is a fact. In the particular school in question, apparently there were several kids with two gay parents, or single parents. The mom-and-pop-and-two-point-five-kids nuclear family is no longer even the norm in many places. \n\n \n Agreed, and I think it's wonderful that school is helping students learn about different families in their community.\n \n \n It's wonderful for parents to be involved in their children's school education -- within limits. It can go overboard when parents try to dictate to teachers every aspect of what their child may or may not learn. \n\n \n I don't think parents should be dictating to teachers either. But I don't see, on the face of it, that this father was.\n \n \n\n Those kids live in a diverse world, with gay people and gay families. They may as well get used to it from an early age. \n\n \n Well, his child will get used to it from an early age if he remains enrolled in the same school. After all, children talk about their families. However, I don't think it's critical that, at age 5, Johnny (or whoever) didn't hear King and King or missed a discussion on same gender families. The father's comfort with the school might be more important to Johnny's adjustment and well being there.\n \n \nAs you say, it's a kindergarten.

The organization has quite a rep I now read. Although schools too can have their own agendas, whether they are left or right of center.\n \n For the most part, though, I saw a typically stressed kindergartner parent (when having an issue with the school). Although I disagree with his views, I am sympathetic to his concern as a parent. It's his child. It is very challenging to go in for those kind of meetings. And they threw a kindergartner's father in jail, for goodness sake, his FATHER -- for having a non-violent sit-in over his desire to be notified about specific lesson material.\n \n Without knowing further details of the school/parent relationship, I think the school should have given this man his notice. Not as a legal responsibility, but as just -- well -- an act of love for the child. For how can they really teach respect for families if they don't honor his, as well?",

So don't even try to attribute the concept to me.\n\n \n Your argument is obviously based on God given rights. These simply do not exist. All rights are given by agreements between those that govern and those that are governed. You can have any right if the government can enforce it, such as an new state paid for car annually. One of the often cited rights is not actually an right. The pursuit of happiness, which actually was property initially is an state of mind.

   "Lesz,\n \n Well, he took them to court! It wasn't that he wanted a right to withdraw his child from certain lessons; he wanted to force the school not to teach the curriculum at all.\n \n O.k., I go along with that .. but on the face of it, that wasn't where he was at in the beginning. That's what it escalated into. (Although let's not forget that he has that right to bring them to court.) I wonder at what point that organization got involved and who funded the law suit. Do you remember the Jena 6 case? The white youth who was assaulted in the school hallway after using racial slurs? Afterwards, a member of some klan-like group paid his parents a visit to see how that family's case could be exploited for their \"cause.\" At first, the parents didn't even know who he was, apparently. Then they found out, and ditched him. My point being, that it wouldn't be the first time, if it happened to this family, too.\n \n Kindergarten is hot for separation issues and high anxieties among parents. I don't think our school system tends to handle it very well, period. And let's face it, gay rights is like a journey to the moon for some. I remember, many years ago, moving for the first time to an area that had a high gay population and strong gay pride movement. It was fairly new, even to me, arriving as an above-average open-minded American. I learned, assimilated, and began to just take certain things for granted. Then, one day, an old friend visited from another area. I'd totally forgotten how different things were for me when I arrived and took her places without any discussion beforehand. Well, she flipped. And didn't tell me at first, either. It came out months later. I didn't consider her feelings and how uncomfortable someof those places might be for her. And she was right -- I had forgotten what it was like for me. But my point is -- this is very different stuff for some people -- and kindergarten and dealing with the public school system for the first time can be challenging enough for parents in itself. I think it's important to use our imaginations and try to see what this father's experience may have been. \n \n I'll also add that it's not unheard of for schools to hold meetings to prep parents on new curriculum being introduced. Particularly if there's any controversy attached. We had that around here with a new math currriculum the district was short-sighted enough to buy. :)\n \n So, just sending folks home with a bag of books and no discussion -- and when it's a bit hotter a topic than math (or maybe not?) -- seems a little short-sighted. Although perhaps they were concerned with what such a community meeting might bring in with the winds ....\n \n No, it probably isn't critical that every child go through what is called these days \"diversity training\", it's probably only needed when there are problems. However, this school apparently was a pretty diverse one.\n \n I wish our school had it. As it was, though, my son for example knew about same gender parents before he even started school because one of his buddies had two moms. One day, he noticed and asked me about it. Which works with my laissez-faire approach ... kids will ask when they're ready, and then, just tell them. Thus far, it has not proved harmful.\n \n What I think many parents don't appreciate, though, is that if their children don't hear about it from adults, they will eventually hear about it from other students. And they might not always be getting the most accurate information. \n \n We live in a country of many p.o.v.'s, and where all families have a right to public school education. While people have options, I don't think we can just say - go home school or get a private school education. Obviously, not everyone is in that position. And people are taxpayers in their communities. So, how can schools accommodate some of these differences without becoming too dictatorial or bending over backwards for every parental fear? I think, one way, is to allow parents some leeway in opting out of activities or coursework. Particularly in the earliest grades when you're building relationships with families and hopefully getting their children well acclimated to the public school environment. Consider that this man may have been a missed opportunity for the district. And consider what his child might not learn. \n \n Ummm... is that really the sort of behaviour you want to see from parents in schools in front of kids? He was truculent and disruptive when he couldn't get his way. Police had to be called. Kids get time outs for that sort of behaviour, he paid a brief visit to the local hoochgow. \n \n I don't know what he was, except that this wasn't in front of children, but in an office with adults, he wasn't violent, and he said that he wasn't leaving until they agreed to provide him notice of lesson activities so that he could opt his child out. It's not the most unreasonable request in the world, and, his child was a kindergartener. Yes, they had the right to call the police. But I don't think the police HAD to be called unless the school was closing for the day and the custodian needed to go home and lock up. If there was a 6th grade class studying protest movements, or putting together a school paper, he might have been an interesting person for a few of the students to interview. A teachable moment.\n \n But hey, I'm more of the alternative and developmental view. I guess.\n \n I don't think there was any disrespect paid to the guy he didn't earn. The school did try to accommodate him and his child, but he wanted the entire program scrapped. He had an anti-gay agenda and wanted to use the school for political purposes.\n \n Again, I agree that might have been the plan from the very beginning, the school might have been hip to his tricks, and just had enough. And they may have quite astute and correct in the actions they took.\n \n Still, I remember what it was like to go into a principal's office for the first time with a cause of my own (that is, MY child), and I remember what it was like to send a little person off into the public school system for the first time, and I remember what it was like the first time I felt like the district had me (if you'll excuse, here) by the balls because they had my child in a classroom and I was powerless over what was transpiring.\n \n They're not there for the long haul. They don't love your child the way you do.\n \n Even that yucky bigot of a parent. He loves his child, Lesz. The school system doesn't.",

   "I remember, many years ago, moving for the first time to an area that had a high gay population and strong gay pride movement. It was fairly new, even to me, arriving as an above-average open-minded American. I learned, assimilated, and began to just take certain things for granted. Then, one day, an old friend visited from another area. I'd totally forgotten how different things were for me when I arrived and took her places without any discussion beforehand. Well, she flipped. And didn't tell me at first, either. It came out months later. I didn't consider her feelings and how uncomfortable someof those places might be for her. And she was right -- I had forgotten what it was like for me. But my point is -- this is very different stuff for some people -- and kindergarten and dealing with the public school system for the first time can be challenging enough for parents in itself. I think it's important to use our imaginations and try to see what this father's experience may have been. \n\n \n Well, fine, but how far do you go? Do you gut an entire curriculum for a school because one parent has a conniption fit about it? Even if I thought the father's concern was sincere, and frankly I don't, there are limits to accommodation. He can always take his child elsewhere. Or if he thinks the world is too sordid for children, he can choose not to have any.\n \n \nSo, just sending folks home with a bag of books and no discussion -- and when it's a bit hotter a topic than math (or maybe not?) -- seems a little short-sighted. Although perhaps they were concerned with what such a community meeting might bring in with the winds ....\n\n \n Well fair enough, but are you going to call a public meeting for every curriculum item? Is that reasonable? Are parents really in the best position to know what is best educationally for their child? And even if you think so, how are you supposed to cater to every individual parental whim in a diverse public school? If the children are THAT sensitive, they shouldn't be in public school.\n \n \nAs it was, though, my son for example knew about same gender parents before he even started school because one of his buddies had two moms. One day, he noticed and asked me about it. Which works with my laissez-faire approach ... kids will ask when they're ready, and then, just tell them. Thus far, it has not proved harmful.\n\n \n Fine. It works for you and your kids. How about kids who don't have parents with your understanding and forbearing approach? How about gay kids with homophobic parents? (Yes, I know that doesn't apply in this particular case as the kids were far too young, but who knows how the father was warping his kids?)\n \n \nWhat I think many parents don't appreciate, though, is that if their children don't hear about it from adults, they will eventually hear about it from other students. And they might not always be getting the most accurate information.\n \n \n An excellent point. parents are not always the most accurate sources of information, either. \n \n \nWe live in a country of many p.o.v.'s, and where all families have a right to public school education. While people have options, I don't think we can just say - go home school or get a private school education. Obviously, not everyone is in that position. And people are taxpayers in their communities. So, how can schools accommodate some of these differences without becoming too dictatorial or bending over backwards for every parental fear? I think, one way, is to allow parents some leeway in opting out of activities or coursework. Particularly in the earliest grades when you're building relationships with families and hopefully getting their children well acclimated to the public school environment. Consider that this man may have been a missed opportunity for the district. And consider what his child might not learn. \n \n \n Well, apparently the parent wasn't interested in opting out of certain curriculum activities. Schools do have some obligation to treat kids the way their parents want them to be treated, but I don't think that extends to shielding them from every aspect of reality the parent is afraid of. If the parent disapproves of internal combustion engines, does that mean the school shouldn't teach road safety?\n \n \nI don't know what he was, except that this wasn't in front of children, but in an office with adults, he wasn't violent, and he said that he wasn't leaving until they agreed to provide him notice of lesson activities so that he could opt his child out.\n\n \n Um, he wouldn't leave till the school agreed to drop the curriculum. The school couldn't assure him that no discussions of same sex parent families would ever take place, because same-sex-parent families attended the school. Is that reasonable?\n \n \nHe loves his child, Lesz. The school system doesn't.\n\n \n The school system has a responsibility to a whole lot of children that aren't his. They're supposed to shaft them to accommodate him? Is that reasonable?",

Is that reasonable?\n \n In this article, he initially wants notification -- the range of which is unclear -- but not dropping the curriculum.\n \n Parker and his wife, Tonia, 34, who was also in court yesterday, said the dispute arose because they asked school officials to notify them about classroom discussions about same-sex marriage and what they called other adult themes. They also wanted the option to exclude their boy, now 6, from those talks.\n \n Parker said he met with school officials to gain those assurances and then refused to leave until he got them. Parker stayed at Estabrook School for more than two hours, according to Superintendent William J. Hurley, as officials and Lexington police urged him to leave. Finally, they arrested him for trespassing.\n \n http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/04/29/arrested_father_had_point_to_make/?page=1\n \n As I said earlier, I don't think it's reasonable for every discussion, because obviously a teacher can't predict every discussion that might arise in a classroom.

   "And this doesn't work because gays are equally protected under the law. The equal protection argument didn't even work the the Lawrence case.\n\n You often say things that are just plain baffling in their blatant inaccuracy.\n In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court struck down a Texas statute prohibiting homosexual sodomy on substantive due process grounds. In Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only homosexual sodomy, and not heterosexual sodomy as well, Texas's statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited City of Cleburne.\n \n Notably, O'Connor did not claim to apply a higher level of scrutiny than mere rational basis, and the Court has not extended suspect-class status to sexual orientation. Much as in City of Cleburne, though, the Court's decision in Romer v. Evans (1996), on which O'Connor also relied in her Lawrence opinion, and which struck down a Colorado constitutional amendment aimed at denying homosexuals \"minority status, quota preferences, protected status or [a] claim of discrimination,\" seemed to employ a markedly higher level of scrutiny than the nominally applied rational-basis test.[21] While the courts have applied rational-basis scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation, it has been argued that discrimination based on sex should be interpreted to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, in which case intermediate scrutiny could apply to gay rights cases.[22]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_protection\n \n \n \nNo it doesn't. Race has always been a different level in the constitution. Once again, originalism wins.\n\n And again, just plain FALSE.\n \n If you honestly look at the history of \"equal protection\", the application to race was often a DELAYED one when it came to the obfuscational means of applying \"secondary\" methods of racial discrimination.\n Like the \"Jim Crow\" laws, and/or \"Grandfather\" clause.\n \n Race has been MADE a different level AFTER THE FACT of the legislation.\n If you actually LOOK at the history of HOW it came to have a \"different\" standard, you would see it is actually by LEGAL PRECEDENT which people like you would declare \"judicial activism\".\n This article argues that strict scrutiny did not originate in equal protection cases. Rather, it originated in the First Amendment in the late 1950s and early 1960s and migrated from there to the Equal Protection Clause in the late-1960s.http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=934795",

The people who opposed interracial marriage claimed that it WAS equal because whites and blacks were both restricted.\n The black had no more right to marry a white than a white had to marry a black.\n \n But SCOTUS blew this pretense of an argument apart, noting that it is NOT the restriction which is to be equal, but the ACTUAL RIGHT itself.\n The argument is blown apart when one realizes the following:\n A white man can marry a white woman.\n A black man cannot marry a white woman.\n INEQUALITY. And it's absurd to pretend that there is equality.\n \n Likewise, a man can marry a woman.\n A woman cannot marry a woman.\n INEQUALITY.\n \n \n \nThe only subject that is given heightened scrutiny is race.

Some were not religious at all. The big difference as I see it is that those that were NOT religious certainly didn't seem to take the hostile outlook toward religion we sometimes see today.

But in no way were they specifically referencing non christian beliefs. That's just what you choose to believe. And the evidence of that is that there were no moslems, hindus, eastern religions, or buddhists represented in the founders club at all, but there were christians, even if they weren't practicing their christian faith. \n \n So the point was to be a-religious in how they structured the Government. But they were in no way anti-christian which is the implication you are attempting to make here.

   "Here's a news report of the Parker-Estabrook incident:\n \n http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1230620&page=1\n \n \nIn several conversations by phone, mail and e-mail, Parker asked teachers and officials at the school to notify him any time the subject of homosexuality was discussed in class.\n \n \"When affirmation and normalization of these lifestyles come up, parents want to know about [it] and have the option to opt out,\" he said.\n \n Dr. Paul Ash, superintendent of Lexington Public Schools, said the school tried to be accommodating.\n \n \"The school department said, 'Look, we'll work with you, but we cannot assure you what a child is going to say and that we can immediately stop a discussion that you find objectionable,'\" said Ash. \"One of the central units in kindergarten is the discussion of families and we show families of all different types.\" Ash says the discussions \"ended up in an irreconcilable difference.\" \n \n After one meeting in April, Parker refused to leave the school without that assurance. He was arrested and, after refusing to post the $40 bail, he spent the night in jail.\n\n \n Hmmmm. Principals don't get to set bail. That's a job for the courts. He got his due process, refused to comply, and hey, he ended up in jail because that's where he wanted to go to make a point.\n \n And just for interest, here's the text of the appeal court decision:\n \n http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=07-1528.01A\n \n \nThe Parkers object to their child being presented in kindergarten and first grade with two books that portray diverse families, including families in which both parents are of the same gender. The Wirthlins object to a second-grade teacher's reading to their son's class a book that depicts and celebrates a gay marriage. The parents do not challenge the use of these books as part of a nondiscrimination curriculum in the public schools, but challenge the school district's refusal to provide them with prior notice and to allow for exemption from such instruction. They ask for relief until their children are in seventh grade.\n \n Massachusetts does have a statute that requires parents be given notice and the opportunity to exempt their children from curriculum which primarily involves human sexual education or human sexuality issues. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, \u00a7 32A. The school system has declined to apply this statutory exemption to these plaintiffs on the basis that the materials do not primarily involve human sexual education or human sexuality issues.\n\n \n The school is right. Just because the school recognises the existence of families with same sex parents does not mean the school is advocating gay sex. Or teaching sex education.\n \n Second, as the ruling goes on to consider, the state of Massachusetts recognises same sex marriage:\n \n \nOn November 18, 2003, a divided Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held, in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003), that the state constitution mandates the recognition of same-sex marriage. A later effort to reverse this decision through the mechanism of a constitutional convention and a popular vote failed.\n\n \n From their conclusion:\n \n \nPublic schools are not obliged to shield individual students from ideas which potentially are religiously offensive, particularly when the school imposes no requirement that the student agree with or affirm those ideas, or even participate in discussions about them. See Fleischfresser, 15 F.3d at 690; Mozert, 827 F.2d at 1063-65, 1070; see also Bauchman, 132 F.3d at 558 (\"[P]ublic schools are not required to delete from the curriculum all materials that may offend any religious sensibility.\" (quoting Florey v. Sioux Falls Sch. Dist. 49-5, 619 F.2d 1311, 1318 (8th Cir. 1980) (internal quotation marks omitted))). The reading of King and King was not instruction in religion or religious beliefs. Footnote Cf. Barnette, 319 U.S. at 631 (distinguishing between compelling students to declare a belief through mandatory recital of the pledge of allegiance, which violates free exercise, and \"merely . . . acquaint[ing students] with the flag salute so that they may be informed as to what it is or even what it means\").\n \n On the facts, there is no viable claim of \"indoctrination\" here. Without suggesting that such showings would suffice to establish a claim of indoctrination, we note the plaintiffs' children were not forced to read the books on pain of suspension. Nor were they subject to a constant stream of like materials. There is no allegation here of a formalized curriculum requiring students to read many books affirming gay marriage. Cf. Mozert, 827 F.2d at 1079 (Boggs, J., concurring) (concluding that such facts could constitute a burden on free exercise, although such a burden would be constitutionally permissible in the public school context if parents still retained other educational options). The reading by a teacher of one book, or even three, and even if to a young and impressionable child, does not constitute \"indoctrination.\"\n \n Because plaintiffs do not allege facts that give rise to claims of constitutional magnitude, the district court did not err in granting defendants' motion to dismiss the claims under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n \n Bottom line: parents do not have the right to insist that public schools do not teach their children about reality. If they have a problem, they can leave.",

Not sure why you aren't getting that one.\n \n \nAnd as I pointed out, that's part of the problem.\n You provide NO legitimacy for the claim other than giving credibility to the claim JUST because the claim has been made.\n If the religion PREACHES misogyny, a point you don't even try to deny, there is NO intelligence or merit to claiming that the women's equality was brought about by the religion itself.\n \n But by your standard, instead of recognizing that the religion OPPOSED such a move, you blindly believe a person giving credit to his religion.\n\n \n This is a double standard on your part.\n \n I would ask that you give this some thought.\n \n - Person A does something BAD; it so happens that his religious text has bad things in it and admonitions to do bad things.\n \n - Person B does something GOOD; it so happens that his religious text (which is the same as person A's, BTW) has good things in it and admonishes to do good things.\n \n Why should I ONLY attribute the motives of person A to religion, but not person B?

You could use that very same explanation to explain the BAD things that Christians have done. Funny how you don't seem to want to touch THAT side of the coin, though. \n \n \nBy your SAME STANDARDS, if I presented you with stories of \"ex-christians\" who had problems that they talk about occurred BECAUSE OF religion, would you accept their claim at face value that it was BECAUSE OF their religion?\n Consider that my one question I want an answer to.\n\n \n Yes.

They understood clearly that freedom of religion meant freedom from religion if that was the individuals choice.

Social unrest seems to happen when we are not so unified and our set of morals is wrong. Think of oppressive regimes, human rights movements. How would it be to live in a society where people are allowed to murder one another? We reason it would be best to not go there. We could not form any kind of human societies, and would not have come as far as we have, indeed when compared to other animals as well.\n \n \nSeems religion provides the only answer. Furthermore, that is far from a starting point because you haven't established where those ideas came from.\n\n \n No, belief in an invisible man does not provide an answer, it is an attempt to explain when something is not understood. \n \n \nNo. All evidence and reason from an incorrect premise leads to that conclusion.\n\n \n Ah, yes, and the only premise you say is belief in your invisible man. Where gay exclusion has come up against reason and education, we've decided to include, to allow full and equal participation of gay people in society. Unquestioned religious zeal or unquestioned bigotry and ignorance and fear in what is not understood, are the only non-arguments which hold back gay rights.",

Your statement is inherently anti-christian in that it implies the founders were promoting non christian, or natural law beliefs.

I didn't say there wasn't a starting point, a point where one has to accept some things as a given, I just disagree with yours. Mine was arrived at differently. The standard for right or wrong is based on knowledge and facts which come about by reasoning, asking questions, experience, and observing what happens.

I have a moral absolute, which is basically a belief or faith, that allows me to derive right and wrong.

Murder could be justified simply because you said your invisible man says murder is good. Nothing else is required. That isn't the case. Things have been thought good because religion said so, then people within the religion and outside started questioning that and realized such things were bad. Many who do not believe in God have reached the conclusion murder is bad by objectively perceivable harm which is caused to humanity by murder. You don't believe everything in the Bible, despite your faith, I am sure. You use reason to determine what is the right and what is not.\n \n Gay people are not to be included like heterosexuals, and we are doing something wrong by being ourselves, because God says so, no other arguments are required, according to the religious absolute standpoint.\n \n There is harm to a group of people when it's excluded for no reason. All humans want into what humanity does, unless there is a good reason to convince us otherwise.\n \n Have those who oppose gay inclusion for religious reasons, ever considered what it would be like for heterosexuals being excluded, less accepted as a group, because of one's basic and fundamental sexuality and its expression, as they would have gay people be treated? No, of course not. No empathy is required for one's fellow humans. God says so, and that's it.",

   "I get hostile when people post information that they know is untrue, when people run away from points, when people make statements that they can't support, when people make slanderous false accusations, and when people pretend that counterarguments don't exist. If you can avoid doing these things, then you'll most likely avoid hostility from me.\n I understand frustration but you have to realize sometimes that this is a forum of people from over the world who only see typed words. Personally, I don't have the time to read everything and research every claim and sometimes think all the way about what someone is trying to say. If I say the sky is gray and you go \"that is untrue you are a liar!\" then you may have just misunderstood me or perhaps don't know where I am coming from. It is too late to clear that up because you have already become hostile and I am on the defensive. Since you really don't know any of us, you really don't know if we are lying or perhaps just wrong or perhaps you just misunderstood us. For example the sky might be gray where I am at this very moment because of cloud cover. Or perhaps I don't see color so I think the sky is gray, or perhaps I just don't know my colors. All three of those means I wasn't lying but to assume the worst case scenario creates a hostile environment. \n \n Personally, I haven't lied on this forum. I've been wrong before but that is a far cry from a lie. \n \n Those other instances of \"unsupported\" facts can really be an issue of time or even unpostable information. If I get a fact from a verbal conversation from a scientist then I can't verify that if I post it on the forum. It doesn't make it any less true.\n \n Slanderous false accusations are bad but the only thing to remember here is that it shouldn't apply as a direct comment to poster (we've all done it though). So if you say \"republicans are all a bunch of babies\" then this is really nothing more than a stupid and poor argument. If you say \"Steve is a republican (which I'm not) and they are all a bunch of babies\" then you get into the slanderous zone...in my opinion.\n \n I think the biggest thing here is just giving the benefit of the doubt to the posters that aren't trying to be trolls/annoying. It is better to ask for a clarification or simply post a correction then to immediately accuse the poster of being something (liar for example). In general, many of the posters here aren't that bad even if you disagree with them. I know you don't get along with Jyoshu but he isn't a bad poster and he fairly genuine. On your side Kronus, you, Jake, and a few others are generally posting what they actually believe and not out there to insult. I won't name the ones, but they exist, who just post insults of the poster they disagree with to try and make a point. These are the ones to complain about.\n \n \nHere is the thread I started on this topic. Note that the OP is not particularly hostile, and -- actually -- I thought we were doing okay before we opted to postpone due to debate judging..\nI'll look into it when I have some time.",

There is growing support for the work of this organization, which is being received cordially by some schools and even corporations. Yet behind its rhetoric of \"rights\" and \"tolerance\" is the sordid reality of what PFLAG actually supports. The world according to PFLAG would encourage children to be self-indulgent and self-centered in every aspect of life; to reject the wisdom of parents and other authorities if they wish even at early ages; and to engage in just about any sexual behavior imaginable.\n \n There is even implied approval of criminal sexual contact of adults with minors.

There is growing support for the work of this organization, which is being received cordially by some schools and even corporations. Yet behind its rhetoric of \"rights\" and \"tolerance\" is the sordid reality of what PFLAG actually supports.

PFLAG believes in total sexual license for people of all ages. For children, this means that virtually any sexual activity as well as exposure to graphic sexual images and material, is not just permissible but good for children, as part of the process of discovering their sexuality.\n \n \"I've been doing drag for about ten years, on and off....my fantasies were all about whipping. I started reading up on S/M, and it was making me interested in sex for the first time...I realized that, for what I was doing, I could be getting good money.\" \n  ( Interview with Minal, a young man who is a cross-dresser and works as a prostitute specializing in sado-masochism, in Revolutionary Voices, Ed. Amy Sonnie, Alyson Books, 2000, pp. 171-172. Book recommended for youth by PFLAG in its brochure, \"Be Yourself\").\n \n \"...From a convenience store in a town thirty miles away that sold liquor to underage customers as well as porn paperbacks, I acquired a copy of a novel called Pretty Boys Must Die. It satisfied my curiosity about what homosexuals did....I was excited out of my mind....I also knew that somewhere out there, beyond Amethyst, someone had to be doing something remotely like what leather hustler Riley Jacks did to na\u00efve young David (the \"Pretty Boy\")....I was ready.....But I had to wait. ...I gorged on new porn when I could get it...I was content to read for hours, and masturbate for hours...\" \n (A man reminiscing about his youth, from Growing Up Gay/ Growing Up Lesbian, ed. Bennett Singer, New Press, 1994, p.53. This book is part of recommended reading by PFLAG in its brochure for parents, \"Our Daughters & Sons.\")\n \n \"Except for her Adam's apple, it was hard to tell Christina was really a young male from the Philippines...My days were spent as a man and my nights as a woman...Christina introduced me to Breezy. She had started taking hormones when she was in her teens...During our physical lovemaking, Breezy was able to express her female and male energies at the same time...I was sad that our affair lasted only four days.\"(Memoir of transgendered youth Shu Wei Chen/ Andy, pp.179-180, in Bi Any Other Name, ed.

Recommended in the PFLAG Bisexuality Resource Packet and in the PFLAG brochure for parents.) \n \n  the novel Rainbow Boys (Alex Sanchez, Simon & Schuster, 2001), three 17-year old boys explore their homosexual attractions. Frequent themes include obtaining pornographic magazines (p.51) and movies (p. 88), as well as graphic descriptions of masturbation (pp.51-52, 70, 89). The book features several scenes of explicit heterosexual sex, and a scene where one of the teen boys has anal intercourse without a condom with a 29-year-old man he has just met via the Internet (p.148). This boy's mom is an officer of the local PFLAG chapter, and comes and goes to meetings throughout the book. Rainbow Boys is recommended by PFLAG in its brochure for youth, \"Be Yourself.\"\n \n  \"...I met this guy named Reggie, who was twenty-three. I met him hanging out in the subway station....He spent the night with me a few times...\"( Memoir from 'D.B.', a 15 year-old runaway and school drop-out, in Two Teenagers in Twenty, Ed. Ann Heron, Alyson Books,1994, page 81. Book recommended by PFLAG in its brochure for youth.)\n \n \"By age twelve, I had become a porn aficionado, since the couple for whom I babysat and my older brother kept copies of the magazines around. I must say that I came in touch with my bisexuality, or my bisexual feelings, through men's pornography.\" ( Lucy Friedland in Bi Any Other Name [cited above], p. 292.)\n \"Well, I'm politically radical...And I'm also sexually radical. I support all people's rights, all lifestyles that are consensual and not coercive. I have many friends in the S & M community and in the transsexual and transvestite communities...I'm a prostitute's rights advocate...\" (Marcy Sheiner, Bi Any Other Name [cited above], p.206.)\n \"I am a triracial, First Nation, Two-Spirit Fairy Trans XXXXXX activist...I am committed to unleashing Out/rage/us Acts of Delightful Revolution.\" (Qwo-Li Driskill, age 22, in Revolutionary Voices [cited above], p.198.)\n \"'My first experience was with a much older man, a friend of Derek's [his dad]...When I was fifteen, he must have been twenty-nine, thirty...I seduced him...It was a wild night.

   "Hi foundit, nice tactic but it isn't going to work. I posted my post with the link below yours so everyone can read my link and plainly see that there is no mention of the brochure \"Be Yourself\" in it.\n\n Archie, I swear you insist on being blind.\n \n It is the VERY FIRST REFERENCE that you quote.\n HERE'S AN EXERPT:\n 1. PFLAG believes in total sexual license for people of all ages. For children, this means that virtually any sexual activity as well as exposure to graphic sexual images and material, is not just permissible but good for children, as part of the process of discovering their sexuality.\n \n \"I've been doing drag for about ten years, on and off....my fantasies were all about whipping. I started reading up on S/M, and it was making me interested in sex for the first time...I realized that, for what I was doing, I could be getting good money.\" \n ( Interview with Minal, a young man who is a cross-dresser and works as a prostitute specializing in sado-masochism, in Revolutionary Voices, Ed. Amy Sonnie, Alyson Books, 2000, pp. 171-172. Book recommended for youth by PFLAG in its brochure, \"Be Yourself\").\n It's the VERY FIRST ONE REFERENCED.\n How you missed it is beyond me.\n \n \n \nNote the bolded from the article for a few examples to get the context. These other sources are just recommended in Pflag brochures, not just Be Yourself.\n\n It states, point-blank, that \"be yourself\" references the \"Revolutionary Voices\" book.\n \n The \"context\" is clear.\n \n And I didn't bother searching for more cause the first one was PROVEN A LIE.\n Your web-site is PROVEN A LIAR, and you don't care. emoticon_xdonno \n \n \n \nAnd here is how these titles can be obtained through Pflag... \n \n http://www.pflag.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/Be_Yourself.pdf\n\n And then you QUOTE \"be yourself\", and the stated book \"Revolutionary Voices\" is completely absent.\n \n I swear. You not only do yourself a disservice, but you damage any credibility you could ever hope to pretend to have.\n You lack the brains to reason through things, and in this case you refused to even READ YOUR OWN QUOTED STATEMENTS to see that it was saying that \"Be Yourself\" referenced a book that it clearly does not.\n \n \n \n \nAfter copying and pasting it several times, and you honestly cannot see from what you have bolded that the link clearly refers to the brochure, \"Be Yourself\"? Everyone else can see it. It is a lie that \"Be Yourself\" promotes that certain book, as the first anti-gay site you linked and pasted several times, claims. Foundit, you and myself have now posted links to the \"Be Yourself\" brochure.\n\n He drives home the phrase \"None are so blind that will not see\".",
