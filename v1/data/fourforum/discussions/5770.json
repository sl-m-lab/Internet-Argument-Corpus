   "Hit record highs yesterday twice, breaking the psychological $60 / barrel mark.\n \n Experience has shown that once you break a major level like that (major on the psych level), you may as well move the bar, it will be above again. There seems to be a lot of profit taking going on, which has driven oil lower.\n \n http://www.businessworld.ie/livenews.htm?a=1200091;s=rollingnews.htm\n http://www.thestreet.com/_googlen/stocks/elinorarbel/10229542.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA\n http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/oct2004/nf20041021_2937_db008.htm\n http://news.cincypost.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050624/BIZ/506240335/1001\n \n Opecs announcement of 500,000 extra barrels per day had no impact. I'm guessing that is because of the last 9 times that opec promised increased outpu, they only managed to pull it off once, and that was when saudi arabia provided some extra....lets face it...tar.\n \n Pickens is apparently caliming that this is the beginning of peak oil:\n \n http://www.resourceinvestor.com/pebble.asp?relid=10766\n \n as is Matthew Simmons:\n \n http://www.resourceinvestor.com/pebble.asp?relid=9692\n \n Personally, I am not sure. I worte a letter to the DOE asking how they formulated oil reserve numbers in the ME and if there was any explanation for the massive reported increase in reserves when OPEC changed its policies regaridng pumping. I got no response, so I had my local congressional rep make a call on my behalf and the answer I got back from DOE was not especially promising. Their response was essentially that they haveno idea where ME naitons get their reserve numbers, but that they are taken at face value, and that they have no idea how they managed to \"find\" more reserves after the change in opec policies, since over 90% of the ME was fully explored at the time.\n \n Any thoughts?",

   "I personally don't think this is the beginning of peak oil. Oil has been driven up lately purely on the basis of speculation.\n \n Another problem is that the oil companies have been sitting on their asses for a long time now, instead of looking for new oil. This is why the supply/demand margin has tightend so fast, which in turn makes people nervous (unjustly IMO). New oil is still out there if you look for at, as can been seen by recent finds of new oil fields in Venezuela.\n The oil companies have now realised this and are finally diverting the necessary funds for oil exploration.\n \n A lot will also depend on the worlds adaptation to new energy sources (or sometimes old ones) or more efficient ways to use energy. Coal is back in fashion, hybrid cars are becoming an everyday sight and nations all over the world are building or thinking about building nuclear powerplants. In Holland our one remaining nuclear powerplant will be held open for longer than was anticipated and we are also planning on building a massive windmill park in the sea.\n Demand for oil will go down and $ 60 or $ 100 oil will just be seen as a momentary lapse of sanity.",

   "As anyone who's familiar with our public exchanges can testify to, commodities are the rough tough market. Futures contracts on oil are making fortunes. Just considering the daily volume in barrels makes a $1.00 gain/barrel on a big contract serious money. And it has to be acquired at least six-months before consumption to allow distribution planning. Some spot loads are traded right down to the point of tankers discharging crude at final destination after more than a dozen changes in ownership. Traders have a finite commodity in demand at near the available level of supply. They can ride it up and down and it just keeps getting better.\n \n I can't see that far out (one of the reasons I never played the commodities markets) and agree with Gamehuis, a lot of factors are involved. I don't know cost/barrel of production for new exploration, but if it offers adequate margin in the current market, I'd think it would be a priority. And I don't see oil companies rushing to spend big bucks in exploration. Everybody's happy but the end user, and that's part of the system. I think it will take a decent sized global economic slowdown to reduce what's now normal consumption and for that reason think it will be traded up as high as markets can absorb. Any guesses on what that price will be?",

Any guesses on what that price will be?\n\n \n \n This is my problem. My crystal ball is fuzzy on the whole oil situation. I get the distinct impression that somewhere along the line, we are being lied to. I am just having trouble ferreting out the lie, who is telling it, and what they are lying about. I am almost certain that Saudi Arabia is lying about either their reserves, or their excess capacity. Not sure which. According to the IAEA, they are lying about their exces capacity. I am having trouble reconciling their reported reserves which jumped form 170 billion barrels to 257 billion barrels between 1989 and 1991, despite the fact that there were no new discoveries in the area to account for such a dramatic increase. Incidentally, in 1990, calcualtion of reserves became a state secret in Saudi Arabia, and for governemtn insiders there to discuss how their reserves are calculated is literally a capitol offense They are beheaded. \n \n I like pickens, becuase he put together a graph 2 years ago with his estimates as far as oil price, and he has been within 2 dollars ever since. This month he even shows it going over $60 (shows $90 by the end of the year). I was almost tempted to get into oil futures after he was right all the time for the last year.",

   "Looking at the way oil prices have skyrocketed I can't help but feel that we are witnessing a bubble.\n Compared to a year ago oil is up 60%. I find it hard to believe that demand and inflation are the main drivers behind this uprecedented spike. The dollar is trading at around the same levels against the Euro as last year and demand certainly hasn't increased tenfold.\n \n This spike in oil prices reminds me a bit too much of the housing bubble: prices go up too much for no real apparent reason. $ 40 - $ 50 oil was reasonable considering the devaluation of the dollar and the rise in demand, but $ 60 - $ 100 oil is just nuts.",

US oil imports are roughly 40% of consumption with a 1.3% yearly growth factor in total consumption from 2003 to 2004, not exactly earth shaking. \n \n When growth graduations (demand) are applied, there's really no basis for the phenomenal price increases other than speculation. Now let's think about what a temporary shortage of supply, say a couple of weeks of US vehicles in long lines at refueling stations, would do to oil prices. That would be an instant $80/barrel market?",

Sounds like the oil industry has the same feeling a lot of people do, what goes up always comes down, and that will be an economic slowdown probably in Europe and the US, reducing or stabilizing consumption. How high speculators and US foreign policy push it up is the only real question.",
