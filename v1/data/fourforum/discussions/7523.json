   "http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/prn/texas/3636527.html\n \n \nCRAWFORD, Texas, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- Today in Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors voted to report Iran to the United Nations Security Council. This important step sends a clear message to the regime in Iran that the world will not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. \n \n The Security Council will now address the IAEA Board's finding of \"Iran's many failures and breaches of its obligations to comply\" with its Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Safeguards Agreement. We expect the Security Council to add its weight to the IAEA Board's calls for the Iranian regime to: return to the Paris Agreement suspending all enrichment and reprocessing activity; cooperate fully with the IAEA; and return to negotiations with the EU-3 of Great Britain, France, and Germany. Those steps are necessary for the regime to begin to restore any confidence that it is not seeking nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian program. \n \n Today's vote by the IAEA Board is not the end of diplomacy or the IAEA's role. Instead, it is the beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort to prevent the Iranian regime from developing nuclear weapons. We will continue working with our international partners to achieve that common objective. The path chosen by Iran's new leaders -- threats, concealment, and breaking international agreements and IAEA seals -- will not succeed and will not be tolerated by the international community. The regime's continued defiance only further isolates Iran from the rest of the world and undermines the Iranian people's aspirations for a better life. \n \n I end with a message to the Iranian people. The action today by the IAEA Board of Governors is not about denying the Iranian people the benefits of civilian nuclear power. The EU-3 and Russia, with the support of the United States, have made the Iranian regime offers that would enable Iran to have a civil nuclear energy program. The international community's sole purpose in this vote is to prevent the acquisition of nuclear weapons by the regime. Iran's true interests lie in working with the international community to enjoy the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy, not in isolating Iran by continuing to develop the capability to build nuclear weapons. \n\n \n I thought this was interesting. This is the part that Americans will pay attention to:\n \n \nToday's vote by the IAEA Board is not the end of diplomacy or the IAEA's role. Instead, it is the beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort to prevent the Iranian regime from developing nuclear weapons. We will continue working with our international partners to achieve that common objective. The path chosen by Iran's new leaders -- threats, concealment, and breaking international agreements and IAEA seals -- will not succeed and will not be tolerated by the international community. The regime's continued defiance only further isolates Iran from the rest of the world and undermines the Iranian people's aspirations for a better life. \n \n\n \n First, if not for Irtans new leaders, we would have no idea that Iran even had a nuclear program. They have been carryign it out for 20 years now and nobody has been the wiser. We did not \"catch\" them, the new leadership decided the program had reached a stage where it would no longer be proper to go on in secret. \n \n Second....the only \"threats\" that have been made are by the US and Isreal. Teh closest Iran has come to threateneing anybody is in saying \"if you attack us you will wish you had not\".\n \n Third...We are the ones breaching international agreement. Not Iran. Iran has the right to pursue nuclear technology for peacful purposes/. They have given IAEA inspectors access to EVERY Iranian nuclear facilty and the ability to pull snap inspections and we still have not hard evidence that they are producing or trying to produce nukes. The Bush administration has done a masterful job of twistign this into a \"guilty until proven innocent\" scenario, which fits in well with their Hitleresq attitudes in general. \n \n Finally, the IAEA seals were there becuase Iran asked them to put them there. Iran was under no legal obligation to halt enrichment or anythign else. It was something they did as a show of good faith. Once it became apparent that the EU3 and the US were not acting in good faith, they resumed their research. \n \n Somehow I doubt that the American public will pick up on this, especially considering the utter stupidity they showed in buying into the BS leading up to the invasion of Iraq. At times I wonder if Bush even understands fully what is going on. \n \n It will be interesting to see what the UNSC comes up with. The referral they recieved does not allow for the use of military force. Essentially they can declare sanctions or limit Iranian diplomatic travel. Sanctions seem unlikely, since Iran can turn around and retaliate with reduced (or halted) oil exports. Iran can survive under sanctions for a lot of years. The west could not survive the oil prices that came with an Iranian embargo for even a year. The Sauds have said they will increase produciton ot make up for any shortfall, but considering the fact that they have promised increases NINE times in the alst 5 years and only delivered once...70,000 barrels per day of worthless, high sulphur heavy crude, I don't think anybody really takes their offer seriously. I think it is oretty much common knowledge by now that OPEC is producing flat out, regardless of rediculous claims that some (such as the Sauds) might make about reserve capacity.",

Sanctions seem unlikely, since Iran can turn around and retaliate with reduced (or halted) oil exports. Iran can survive under sanctions for a lot of years...\n\n \n I find it hard to imagine what even the most frothingly bellicose neocon thinks they're going to do about Iran. As you say, sanctions are not a viable option in the case of Iran, and I can't believe even Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz are contemplating military action. An invasion with the goal of regime change is out of the question, as the US military is already overstretched and would find itself with the vast swathe of Persia from Kirkuk to Kandahar up in arms and even more likely than it is already to undergo some kind of pan-arab Islamic Revolution.\n Even missile strikes would be foolish, given that Iran would respond in the same way as it would to sanctions and any such action would only strengthen the Ayatollah's hold on the Iranian people. \n The only scenario I can think of is that the US government actually believed that countries like Iran, having seen that the US did actually go into Iraq, showing their willingness to use their power globally in defiance of world opinion, would be sufficiently cowed to just toe the line in return for an easy life. What a tragic underestimation of arab/Islamic nationalism, solidarity and determination.\n It still boggles my mind that US administrations since the Vietnam War don't understand that people from other countries are just as proud of their identity as are Americans, Vietnam being the perfect example as an essentially rural peasant society successfully resisted and kicked out the world's military superpower through the sheer bloody determination that it was no-one else's place to solve their problems for them.\n The domestic aspect of portraying Iran as a villain is obvious, Bush Cheney et al have run out of Bogeymen to terrorise the American population with, so they've moved onto the next spoke of the Axis of Evil. It smacks as much of desperation as all the administration's other current ploys. They know they're a bunch of rats on a sinking ship, but they're still trying to convince the mice that there are other ships out there full of dogs who are going to board them any second so the mice don't notice their cheese is running low and there's a suspicious sloshing sound coming from below decks.\n I give myself 9 out of 10 for that little metaphor!",

Could be that this is part of the motivation with the 'pleasant' side effect of you becoming able to produce nuclear weapons if you want to.\n Essentially, if a decade or so they will need the enrichment plants anyway so might it be better to use the oppertunity to earn ourselves some brownie points with Iran rather than making hollow threats and convincing them further of the need for nuclear weapons.",

He will destroy all the wicked and will propagate honesty and theism. He will govern the entire world several years and in the golden era of his appearance, people will experience a divine government, which was desired by all of previous prophets and Imams. In this era, Jesus Christ will come from sky to the earth to help Mahdi (PBUH). The number of his leading companions are 313 (same as the number of soldiers in the first battle of Islam) who are the outstanding people in the history. In fact most of them do not belong to that time but they will gain their lives once again by the command of Allah (SWT) to help Mahdi (PBUH). Further, he will punish the enemies of previous Imams. More details about this era will be discussed in the article: \"Reappearance Era\".\n \n And finally, after years of his governorship, he will be martyred by the most vicious of all people and that is the time when all people will die and will be raised by Allah's (SWT) will in the day of resurrection for the final judgment. \n \n \n",

It will begin with a \"shock & awe\" style bombing campaign, followed by the annexation of Khuzestan, a province near the Iraqi border where 90% of Iran's oil is. The reason for this move will be motivated by more than mere greed for oil. It is part of a policy to keep the Euro out of the Middle East where it can compete with the US dollar on the world market. The dollar is already in danger with our 8 trillion $ national dept. Iran is already making plans to sell oil for Euros instead of dollars (just as Saddam Hussein was before shock & awe #1). \n \n Instead of bickering over small issues, like Iran's holocaust denial, or some vague talk about its nuclear threat (like Israel's, India's or Pakistan's \"nuclear threat?), look at the global picture. See how that fits in with the geopolitical aims of building a Mid East empire to keep the dollar solvent by making it the only currency available for the oil trade.
