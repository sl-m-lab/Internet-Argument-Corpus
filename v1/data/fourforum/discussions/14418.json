   "I was getting irritated by White Supremacists who claim to be pro-Confederate, and much more nonsensically, Libertarian, which is virtually opposite their fascist, collectivist ideology. So now I'll try to address most of their claims about the Confederation, which demonstrate that they have almost no understanding of the CSA.\n \n Before we begin, I will admit that the South was a racist Country. I don't like to admit that, but I do admit it because I pretty much have too. I will make it clear that I am against any kind of racism, and I do not like the racist aspects of the South. However, Southern racism was nothing like the \"White Nationalism\" bulls*** that White Supremacists today promote.\n \n \"Confederate Nazism\" is an oxymoron. Does anyone here really think a Confederate supporter from the Civil War era would ever support a fascist, federalist, collectivist ideology like Nazism when those things are virtually opposite of everything the South fought for? Confederates fought against Federal Government (Con-federate), so no real Confederate would ever support huge fascist Nazi government.\n \n More Than 10,000 Jews Fought For The Confederacy\n \n Sorry (or more accurately, not sorry) to shatter your egos, neo-Nazis and KKK, but the Confederate States of America was not a white-supremacist country, much less an anti-Jewish country or a \"White-nationalist\" country. Louisiana held about 1/3 of the United State's Jewish population prior to the Civil War, and more than 10,000 of them fought for the Confederacy, many of them as officers.\n \n Mexicans, American Indians, and possibly Hispanics in general faced some level of discrimination in the very deep south, but black people were the main victims of Southern Oppression. Contrary to the claims of white-supremacist groups who claim to be pro-CSA, the Jim Crow laws were not meant to elevate white people above all other races, but rather they were specifically meant to oppress black people, sometimes with other races at the back of the mind. Yet thousands of black people stood up for the Confederacy, hoping it would change for the better by abolishing slavery and Jim-Crow laws.\n \n Those who claim that the South will come back as a White Nationalist country are pretenders. Those who believe that the South ever was White Nationalist, a \"White Country\", or anything like that are wrong. And those who think that the Confederacy was all about racism and white supremacy are not only wrong, but ignorant.",
