So, I have a few questions to throw out there to see what people think.\nI'm sure that if you were to dissect any mammal you would be equally impressed by the complexity, order, and unity. It's amazing how similar all mammals are to each other.\n \nThe existance of time seems to imply a beginning.\nYes. Studies by cosmologists, astrophysicists, and astronomers have found evidence that our universe \"began\" about 13.7 billion years ago. Let me recommend that you read the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe web site. Click on \"Universe\" to learn the basics of Cosmology. On the left is a menu with several major topics with some minor topics in each displayed below them. Click through each of the minor topics and then on the next major topic.\n \nHow can something come out of nothing? It seems that before that first thing that existed something had to exist before that.\nYes. We all ask this question of creationists who propose that the universe was created out of nothing - poof! But science doesn't try to answer that question. We do know that the universe began expanding about 13.7 billion years ago. What went before that and the cause for the expansion isn't known and at present, and may never be knowable. However, we do know that particles can and do spring into existence from nothing, for no apparent reason. Google \"Casimir effect\" and read about one example. Wikipedia will probably be the 3rd entry. This something from nothing is an effect from the zero-point energy of a vacuum.\n \nIs there something that has always existed?\nUnknown. As I mentioned before, we lack the ability to investigate the nature of matter before matter, and time before time. In fact, the two major theories of physics (relativity and quantum mechanics) give nonsense answers when they both apply at the same time (something very massive and very small).\n \nWith the big bang theory, where did those gasses come from?\nInitially, the big bang was just energy. We have learned from Einstein (E=Mc^2) that matter is just condensed energy. Current theories are that matter is made up of small particles (atoms) that are in turn made up of even smaller particles (protons, and neutrons) that are made up of smaller particles (quarks). One theory suggests that quarks are actually strings of energy that exist in 11 dimensional space. It is all quite confusing, but the math works and has predictive power.\n \nWhere would the pressures come from that would cause gasses to come into existance?\nPressure doesn't cause gas. Please consult the page on Nucleosynthesis at the WMAP site. If you start at the beginning and follow through, that page will be presented after appropriate background information to help you understand.\n \nWhere did the pressures come from that caused those pressures to come into existance ... and on and on.\nNow you have me confused. I'm not sure of what pressure you are talking about. Whoever said that the universe is pressure? \n \nThe existance of space. Did space evolve? And before, that did that space evolve?\nDepends on what you mean when you use the word evolve. The old meaning of the word means to change in a particular direction. So in that sense, I guess space evolved. It has changed in that it has expanded from a singularity. Space is the expansion of the universe.\n \nDid the laws of nature evolve? If so does that mean they can change?\nDepending on what you mean by \"laws of nature,\" as near as we can tell, they seem to have been the same everywhere and at all times. However, what we know of those laws gives nonsense answers when applied to the time in the first instants after the initial expansion of the universe. There also seems to have been a time of increased expansion, called the inflationary period, right after the big bang. There still seems to be much about the nature of the universe that isn't understood, but this probably isn't because of changes in how the universe works but merely our imperfect understanding.\n \nAlso, what is the deal with all this perfection and unity in the universe?\nI have no idea what you are talking about.\n \nWhat is the skinny on how life come into existance? How can life come from non-life and are there any examples (evidence) of that happening?\nIt happened so long ago that we don't know and probably never will with certainty. Is that a problem for you? But we do have evidence, and there are observed events that indicate how it might have happened, and we are discovering organisms around volcanic vents in the ocean that don't exist anywhere else and aren't like life anywhere else.\n \nWhat is the convincing evidence (that would keep one from taking a leap of faith to believe in the theory) for macroevolution and secular humanism?\nNo one who understands what science is and how it works \"believes\" in any theory. Do you believe in the theory of gravity? Or maybe you accept it as the best explanation we have for the observed phenomena. I certainly hope that you are aware that you have just made a huge jump in concept from the discussion of the universe to a discussion of life and the evolution thereof. I hope you are aware that the biological theory of evolution is not concerned with the big bang, the origin of matter or gas, or even the origin of life. The normal meaning of the word evolution is in reference to the biological theory. In biology \"evolution\" has a very specific meaning that does not apply outside of biology. Creationists many times tell us that they don't accept \"Darwinism\" and then argue about the big bang. It just makes them look foolish. The theory of evolution is exclusively about life and how it changes. All other uses of the word \"evolution\" mean change, nothing more.",

   "Welcome. I have a couple of responses for your consideration.\n \n \nThe existance of time seems to imply a beginning. How can something come out of nothing? It seems that before that first thing that existed something had to exist before that.\n \n Is there something that has always existed? With the big bang theory, where did those gasses come from? Where would the pressures come from that would cause gasses to come into existance? Where did the pressures come from that caused those pressures to come into existance ... and on and on. \n \n The existance of space. Did space evolve? And before, that did that space evolve?\n\n \n This is interesting as I think it illustrates how people find it difficult to separate our comphrension and experience of existence from the ideas we have when trying to explain the world around us. We have a beginning and an end and events inbetween. The same sequence can be seen on many things in the world around us. However, does this mean the same is true of the universe? It is not established what the relationship the universe has with beginnings and endings, perhaps we are seeing the one-off event of the universe in progress, but we could also be seeing a stage in a repeating process by which the universe exists more than once? (there is some very complex mathematics that back such a notion up!)\n \n Also how do you view the immortal soul within the context of a universe that will come to an end? What happens to heaven when the universe ends?\n \n \nAlso, what is the deal with all this perfection and unity in the universe?\n\n \n Again I would ask you to consider the human perspective and how it can limit our ability to view the world around us. Life is incredible in its complexity and function but it is not perfect. Every part of the human body can malfunction with sometimes fatal consequences, as a matter of fact this is everybodys ultimate fate as we are genetically programmed to only last a certain number of years.\n \n As to the universe I'd say it exists in a state of dangerous flux, a beautiful star today, an enormous and destructive supernova of tomorrow. The universe has little regard for any unity except that the exists as a result of the constraints of physical properties and these are only passing.\n \n \nWhat is the skinny on how life come into existance? How can life come from non-life and are there any examples (evidence) of that happening?\n\n \n As pandion suggested, we know that life began in more than one way on earth as evidenced by photosynthetic and chemosynthetic life but as to the exact \"how\" of origins that is unanswered. Unforunately our place in history makes it almost impossible to examine evidence of the event as it has gone and left nothing for us to view. Fortunately, rational thought allows us to know some things such as there is a time when there was no life, a time when life was very simple and times when life became very complex. We have a tendancy to figure things out and discover new findings so no doubt there are many new things to learn on the question of the origin of life. If we consider we have no knowledge of what (for example) Jesus ate while he was 14, we can still assume he did eat something as otherwise he would have died very quickly. We may not know the exact detail, but can deduce the event happened.\n \n \nWhat is the convincing evidence (that would keep one from taking a leap of faith to believe in the theory) for macroevolution and secular humanism?\n\n \n Well, your question doesn't need the macro bit in there as evolution happens or it doesn't, the \"macro\" bit is once again an artifact of our view on the world (ie. our short lives make it rather difficult to see evolution shape anything other than the organisms with the fastest of reproductive cycles.) Given we have evidence of life (fossils) changing over time (radiometric dating and stratigraphy) we know it takes many of thousands, if not millions of years for noticable to-the-eye changes in animals to occur. Once again it is important to consider perspective- we only have the equivalent of a few frames (fossils) from the movie of life (geological time) and there is much that is lost to history forever. Still, enough remains to support evolution, unless you were to purposefully disregard the facts we find.\n \n On your final point it is rather out of context, and I suspect not accidentally so. I'm not sure what on earth consitutes \"convincing evidence\" for any philosphical outlook on life, be it theistic or otherwise.",

   "chloe: Also, what is the deal with all this perfection and unity in the universe? \n\n \n Sounds like a metaphysical question to me.\n \n What perfection in the universe?

The parasites, bacteria, and viruses that cause diseases? The genetic errors that cause something like 50% of all pregnancies to end in spontaneous abortion? \n \n And what exactly is the universe 'fine tuned' for? Apparently, the production of black holes!

A 2003 journalism graduate of Texas A&M, he was also the public-affairs officer who sought more control over Dr. Hansen's public statements.\n \n In October 2005, Mr. Deutsch sent an e-mail message to Flint Wild, a NASA contractor working on a set of Web presentations about Einstein for middle-school students. The message said the word \"theory\" needed to be added after every mention of the Big Bang.\n \n The Big Bang is \"not proven fact; it is opinion,\" Mr. Deutsch wrote, adding, \"It is not NASA's place, nor should it be to make a declaration such as this about the existence of the universe that discounts intelligent design by a creator.\"\n \n It continued: \"This is more than a science issue, it is a religious issue. And I would hate to think that young people would only be getting one-half of this debate from NASA. That would mean we had failed to properly educate the very people who rely on us for factual information the most.\"\n \n The memo also noted that The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual specified the phrasing \"Big Bang theory.\" Mr. Acosta, Mr. Deutsch's boss, said in an interview yesterday that for that reason, it should be used in all NASA documents.\n \n The Deutsch memo was provided by an official at NASA headquarters who said he was upset with the effort to justify changes to descriptions of science by referring to politically charged issues like intelligent design. Senior NASA officials did not dispute the message's authenticity.\n \n Mr. Wild declined to be interviewed; Mr. Deutsch did not respond to e-mail or phone messages. On Friday evening, repeated queries were made to the White House about how a young presidential appointee with no science background came to be supervising Web presentations on cosmology and interview requests to senior NASA scientists. \n",

Where is god. Who created the where that god exists in. And so on. Even positing a creator get's you nowhere...I would suggest observe reality for what it is, not what you perhaps would like it to be...\n \n \nThe existance of time seems to imply a beginning. How can something come out of nothing? It seems that before that first thing that existed something had to exist before that. \n\n Not really. Think about it, before and after are related to time. Before time...that doesn't make sense. Remember also that science is about reality, not fiction. If there is evidence of something (this can even be indirect evidence like mathematic models and combinatiosn of other laws/theories of physics), then it can be discussed and researched. If not, then it's not something real (as we know it).\n \n \nIs there something that has always existed? With the big bang theory, where did those gasses come from? Where would the pressures come from that would cause gasses to come into existance? Where did the pressures come from that caused those pressures to come into existance ... and on and on. \n\n \n That's just it chloe, we can't even say where water comes from, it's made from the same space/time as everything else, you, me, the sun, the universe as we know it. We don't know some things are created and some aren't. We simply have no evidence of the requirement for \"coming from something else\".\n \n What physics/cosmology actively (like even as I type) research, and spend some of their short lives on, is discovering the pieces of the puzzle. And progress has been, and continues to be made. Isn't that exciting? They are even working on a unified theory (theory of everything), which could be an answer of sorts...or just lead to more questions. The point is, by accepting what we know, and don't know, we can work on knowing more, saving more lives, helping others more efficiently, and so on. \n \n \n \nThe existance of space. Did space evolve? And before, that did that space evolve?\n\n Existence is a tricky term, like \"behind, and before time\", it has less meaning when we talk about the universe. The universe IS (we accept). To \"exist\" is just a common term we use to distinguish what's in our head, and what we \"observe\" in reality. If the universe IS reality, then how can it \"exist\"? Existence is again, a seperation of our concepts, vs observed reality. Space, in those terms, necessarily exists.\n \n As to space evolving, no, not like the evolution of life (change in allele frequency etc.). Did space change? I think so, big bang to now, things have changed, but it's doubtful that the rules governing the changes changed....(back to unified theory of everything).\n \n \nDid the laws of nature evolve? If so does that mean they can change?\n (no, see above). If you mean \"change\", then also no, we have not been able to demonstrate that they have, or a mechanism by which this could take place.\n \n \nAlso, what is the deal with all this perfection and unity in the universe? \n\n Perfection is a relative, human concept.\n Unity and absolutes are seem to be necessary parts of the reality we are part of.\n \n \nWhat is the skinny on how life come into existance? How can life come from non-life and are there any examples (evidence) of that happening? \n\n \n Chloe, remember we are young, very, very young in culture. Man's discovery of the world around us proceeds at a much faster pace than it did 4000 years ago...but compared to the age of the earth...or the universe...\n \n In general, all life is made of inorganic matter, it's just arranged in a way that we observe (since we're alive). \n \n There are theories on this (can look up links later). I have also read a few books touching on it. Basically the interaction of energy (lighting, the sun, meteor impact, radiation) with non-organic matter can create what we term \"organic\" matter. In the right conditions, a set of molecules that start assembling in some order, can ultimately give rise to the building blocks of life.\n \n You have to undersatnd that within our bodies, trillions of cells do things. Within these cells are en enormous number of atoms and packets of energy. Parts of a cell can create strands of DNA...by itself...with no conscious entity guiding it...all day, all night. Why is the concept of the first such elementary particle groups, do the same thing (self assemble/replicating, etc.) a stretch? It's not.\n \n \nWhat is the convincing evidence (that would keep one from taking a leap of faith to believe in the theory) for macroevolution and secular humanism?\n\n \n 1 shred of verifiable/observable evidence of ANY kind. There is none, and we suspect, never will be. Additionally, it would have to be demonstrated how macro evolution cannot have been the mechanism by which life changes to what we categorize as species. That's what knowledge is all about.\n \n The reason this won't happen is because saying it will or might happen, would be like saying we expect gravity will suddenly go away, based on nothing. Or that the sun will explode tomorrow, based on nothing. Or that water will turn into fire, based on nothing. There is no reason, there is no mechanism. If there was, we'd be observing it too. \n \n -Mach",
