It was a political move. But I completely disagree with some of your reasoning. How is a crime against a gay person a hate crime?

Also, please provide a quote and source for Bush's apparent comment stating that gays are sinners. I must have missed that one.",

I must have missed that one.\n\n \n \n Now we are heading for the same old debate, is homosexuality a choice. I have been gay my entire life. In my younger days I fought with myself tooth nail and razor blade to \"make it go away\". I was even engaged to marry a nice girl. There was no choice. The attraction to women wasn't there. I have never been attracted to women. It is not about choice. I never chose to be gay. I have just never been attracted to women. I do not see them in a sexual way and I never have. On the other hand I do see men in a sexual way. I always have. There was never a choice. The only choice was the day I said to myself I would like to be happy and fall in love. the next logical step was to find a nice person I am attracted to and go for it! I found that person and have been with them for five years. Where was the choice?",
