   "  WOODHAVEN: Officer giving gun safety lessons to schoolchildren \n In an effort to make sure children are kept as safe as possible from accidental shootings, Donnelly applied for a grant sponsored by the National Rifle Association.\n \n Through the Eddie Eagle gun-safety program, Donnelly's goal was to bring a message to about 450 children in kindergarten through third grades by Oct. 14.\n \n So far, he has brought his message to more than 900 students in Woodhaven.\n \n Donnelly said children are taught to stop what they are doing and not to touch the handgun. They also are told to immediately leave the area.\n \n Eddie Eagle delivers the message and does a little shuffle dance, which the children appear to enjoy.\n \n The message also is given on a smaller scale to children during the city's Safety Town presentations. An important part of both messages is that guns are not toys, even though some guns look like toys.\n \n Donnelly said it is much more difficult to hold the attention of young children, but the addition of a character seems to help tremendously.\n",
