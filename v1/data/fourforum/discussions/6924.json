Today, they are facing a refinancing penalty and are unable to financially help a son who wants to attend a trade school.\n\n \n snip\n \n \nOn a recent Saturday morning, Enie and Tony Brooks joined a small group at a foreclosure prevention workshop led by Urban, hoping to hear a way to save their home of 17 years.\n \n The couple obtained an ARM for $146,000 in 2003 and the rate has climbed from 7 percent to 9.5 percent -- and could increase up to 11 percent. Today, their payment is about $1,200 a month.\n \n \"It's already astronomical what we have to pay,\" Enie Brooks said. \"We're not in foreclosure but, you know, paycheck-to-paycheck living. Things are getting rough.\"\n\n \n Can you say \"retarded monkeys\"? \n \n I generally do not feel sorry for people who make stupid decisions, especially when the information is out in the public domain if they would just LOOK to make decisions that are NOT completely idiotic. \n \n Yesterday I got a report back that I comissioned regarding probable real estate futures. The results were, in short, horrifying. Mos tprobably scenario is a 50% decline in new home construction by the end of next year. This would result in an overall GDP loss of 1.75% (just the lost construction). The flow through multiplier on that is 4.5-4.75 percent. Brutal. \n \n Additionally, according to my numbers, roughly 9 trillion dollars in real estate \"wealth\" will vanish between January and decemebr of next year, with another 3.5 trillion vanishing between january and may of 2007. \n \n With mortgage defaults running between 35 and 38% (which is actually lower than the previous numbers I have seen), there is no bottom to the market as people find that even their fixed rate mortgages include provisions in the event that the value of their property falls below the balance due ont he mortgage (this will be a problem for roughly 54% of current mortgage holders)\n \n Historic data shows very clearly that the idea that this will be confined to isolated regions is preposterous. Historically, large real estate corrections tend to be nationwide, though they hit harder in some regions than others. \n \n The only real uncertainty left seems to be exactly how bad it will be, since 80% of our GDP is consumer spending, and a fall in the housing market will lead to significant job loss, which will facilitate a further fall in the market. An ugly self perpetuating cycle. \n \n I actually am starting to feel sorry for folks like those highlighted in the article. Sure, they did something that was incredibly stupid. At the same time, I think there was almost a conspiracy (not quite, but almost) among public figures to ensure that people remained pacified and kept spending. That lost real estate wealth will bcoming directly out of the pockets of middle class (soon to be lower class) America.",

   "Agreed never ever ever go with an ajustable rate mortgage because it will always get adjusted upwards. I locked in a 4.75% 15 year mortgage.\n\n \n Personally, I cannot fathom what would motivate somebody to pick up an ARM when prime is at 1%. At that point, there is absolutly zero chance that interest rates are going to drop. They can ONLY go up. So you pay a little more on a fixed rate in the short run. In the long run, you will absolutly pay more on the ARM.\n \n When is the American public going to stop thinking of 6 months as \"long term\" when it comes to finances?",

This was heavily encouraged by the government and Greenspan. In fact, in mid 2004, Greenspan recommended that people switch from fixed mortgages to ARMs in an effort to renew the consumer spending and GDP surge that came with the first round of refinancing. \n \n There is a somewhat interesting article about this at http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0404.wallace-wells.html",
