   "Defining \"bigot\" by whether or not you morally agree with somebody is futile.\n One person can say that Jack is a bigot, and another can disagree. All based on subjective moral value judgments.\n\n \n The word \"bigot\" and the word \"immoral\" are not necessarily synonymous. I don't think I have suggested that they are (maybe I wasn't clear, though). Let me try to explain my reasoning and see what you think.\n \n In the context of this thread, Matthew S seems to be equivocating \"harm\" with \"immoral.\" In other words, a person is \"evil if they seek to harm others. This is a moral claim, and for Matthew S, anyone that harms (or seeks to harm) others is immoral.\n \n Now, Matthew S has freely admitted that he has no problem with harming others. Specifically, he has singled out a class of people that he wishes to harm: mainly, \"those attending...bible churches.\"\n \n In this context, it seems that when Matthew S admits to being a bigot, he is admitting to more than just an intolerant viewpoint, he is admitting to acting on that intolerant viewpoint to the point of harming others, an immoral action by his own standard.\n \n For the record, I think his harm standard is a bunch of bunk. I have tried to get him to explain this in more detail, but he has continually refused. Without any qualification, the harm principle cannot be taken as a serious moral standard.\n \n \nHow many racist bigots actually think they are \"bigots\" because they think their morality is the right one and others are screwed up?\n\n \n I'm not sure what you're getting at here. I would merely point out that most people won't admit to being a bigot precisely because the term is pejorative. It seems to me that most people will do anything they can to not be called a bigot because the common use of that word does involve a notion of morality. \n \n \nI think defining \"bigot\" according to subjective morality is only making the word more confusing.\n\n \n I am not one to adhere to the notion that morality is subjective. However, even if I did, I think the context of this discussion would compel the conclusion I made. That is, according to Matthew S' moral judgment, harming others is immoral. Also, it seems according to him that singling out a class of people AND seeking to inflict harm on them (or actually doing so) is not only immoral, but bigoted. In other words, if you haven't figured it out by now, I think the context in which the term bigot has been discussed, it carries with it a notion of morality.\n \n \nYou are assuming that Matthew's definition of \"bigot\" includes a requirement that the \"bigot\" be morally wrong.\n I don't think it does.\n I know mine doesn't.\n\n \n Actually, I am not assuming this at all. The statement I made here deals more with Matthew S' harm standard, than his admission to being a bigot. Matthew S holds that harming others is immoral. He admits that he is actively seeking to harm people. Therefore, he admits that he actively engages in the exact behavior he disapproves of, and in fact wants others to join him in this.",

I don't think I have suggested that they are (maybe I wasn't clear, though).\n\n I am not saying the words are \"synonymous\" in any way. I am saying that the definition of the word \"bigot\" should not include \"moral\" requirements.\n It's like saying the definition of \"horse\" does not include requirements as to the color. As in, if a horse is defined as brown, then an animal is precluded from being a horse just because it's white.\n Likewise, what constitutes \"bigotry\" does not include \"moral\" requirements. Just because another person agrees with the morality of another person doesn't mean he is any less bigotted.\n Matthew believes he is morally justified in his position. He still considers himself a bigot.\n You don't seem to realize that he classifies himself as a \"bigot\" according to his own definition, and if he were to use YOUR definition, he would NOT claim to be a bigot.\n \n \n \nIn the context of this thread, Matthew S seems to be equivocating \"harm\" with \"immoral.\" In other words, a person is \"evil if they seek to harm others.

I would merely point out that most people won't admit to being a bigot precisely because the term is pejorative. It seems to me that most people will do anything they can to not be called a bigot because the common use of that word does involve a notion of morality. \n\n Even Jyoshu's definition is devoid of any mention of \"morality\".\n \"Morality\" is a subjective ideal that some people insert connotatively.\n I submit that people don't admit to being a \"bigot\" based not only on the perjorative, but also on the fact that their own PERSONAL MORALITY is not conflicted by their view, and as such using your standard, they do not consider themselves as a bigot.\n \n \n \nI am not one to adhere to the notion that morality is subjective.\n\n I have always found such statements amusing.\n People's opinions on what is moral ARE subjective.\n Whether or not people feel that should be the case is an ENTIRELY SEPARATE issue.\n Just because some people feel that their moral beliefs should be considered as an \"objective\" universal standard does not mean that morality isn't subjective.\n \n \n \nHowever, even if I did, I think the context of this discussion would compel the conclusion I made. That is, according to Matthew S' moral judgment, harming others is immoral.\n\n Again, you assume that \"harming others is immoral\" is an absolute with no corollaries.\n A man could claim that shooting another person is immoral, but if that man's family is attacked and all he has is a gun to defend himself, then the \"self-defense\" ideal will more than likely override his \"morality\".\n Likewise, Matthew has typically talked about people he sees as harming HIM.\n He can correct anything I said which is inaccurate, but I think you're taking one statements of his out of a bigger context which I have seen eminating from his posts in the past.\n \n \n \nAlso, it seems according to him that singling out a class of people AND seeking to inflict harm on them (or actually doing so) is not only immoral, but bigoted. In other words, if you haven't figured it out by now, I think the context in which the term bigot has been discussed, it carries with it a notion of morality.\n\n To some, I'm sure it does.\n But there is one glaring problem with your analysis. You are trying to logically infer, based on YOUR PERSONAL definitions, that Matthew thinks his actions and beliefs are immoral.\n I don't think he believes that, explained as above...\n Furthermore, morality and bigotry may have common grounds and overlapping issues, but that doesn't mean they are inter-dependent.\n \n \n \nActually, I am not assuming this at all. The statement I made here deals more with Matthew S' harm standard, than his admission to being a bigot. Matthew S holds that harming others is immoral. He admits that he is actively seeking to harm people. Therefore, he admits that he actively engages in the exact behavior he disapproves of, and in fact wants others to join him in this.\n\n And this assumes the \"harm\" standard is absolute, with no exceptions.\n \n Above all, this is my perspective on Matthew's views. I'm not an expert, and Matthew can answer these questions for himself.\n I'm not voicing agreement with Matthew either, but rather trying to establish where I think he is coming from.\n \n \n Another conversation altogether is to discuss Matthew's views and statements as a parallel to the anti-gay lobbying groups and anti-gay activists.

I thought I would speak to this point though.\n \n It takes 38 states for a Constitutional amendment to pass, which means if 13 states fail to ratify, the amendment does not pass. Now, suppose that amendment X comes before the states, and they vote on it. Suppose the number is as close as possible to ratifying - 37 for, and 13 against. Suppose further that the thirteen against were the 13 least populous states in the union. That would give us the following 13 states from least population to 13th least population (July 2005 Population Data).\n \n 1: Wyoming - 509,294\n 2: Vermont - 623,050\n 3: North Dakota - 636,677\n 4: Alaska - 663,661\n 5: South Dakota - 770,883\n 6: Delaware - 830,364\n 7: Montana - 926,865\n 8: Rhode Island - 1,080,632\n 9: Hawaii - 1,262,840\n 10: New Hampshire - 1,299,500\n 11: Maine - 1,317,253\n 12: Idaho - 1,393,262\n 13: Nebraska - 1,747,214\n \n Total the population of these 13 states, and you get 13,061,495 people.\n \n Now, divide that number by the total population in July 2005, which was 296,410,404.\n \n That gives us 0.044065575. Multiply by 100, and we get 4.406557538%.\n \n Thus, 4.41% of the population could stop a Constitutional Amendment.\n \n Maybe Scalia was wrong? Or......Maybe not.\n \n This would be assuming that 100% of the people in those 13 states opposed the amendment. However, it is also possible that only <50% of the people in all those states oppose the Amendment. Thus, we can redo our calculation.\n \n We can multiply all the state populations by 0.5000001 to give us a rough estimate of barely greater than a majority opposing the amendment in the 13 least populous states. Doing so, we get the following numbers:\n \n 1: Wyoming - 254647.0509\n 2: Vermont - 311525.0623\n 3: North Dakota - 318338.5637\n 4: Alaska - 331830.5664\n 5: South Dakota - 385441.5771\n 6: Delaware - 415182.083\n 7: Montana - 463432.5927\n 8: Rhode Island - 540316.1081\n 9: Hawaii - 631420.1263\n 10: New Hampshire - 649750.13\n 11: Maine - 658626.6317\n 12: Idaho - 696631.1393\n 13: Nebraska - 873607.1747\n \n Adding these numbers together, we get 6530748.806 people. Let's go ahead and round that to 6530749 people, since we can't have .806 people.\n \n Divide that number again by total population, 296,410,404. We get 0.022032793. Multiply it by 100, and we get 2.203279275%\n \n Thus, supposing that every state legislature listens to the majority of it's citizens, and supposing that only the least amount possible over 50% in the 13 least populous states oppose the amendment, 2.2% of the population could block a constitutional amendment.",

But when you start getting into things that are made up like \"substantive due process\" and \"evolving standards of decency\" and \"right to privacy\" you get things that are not enacted by the majority but enacted by the courts and forced upon everyone. In other words have an insanely small minority rule over a majority.\n \n \n\n Meaningless reply.\n Completely avoids what I said.\n \n Our constitution was designed to protect the rights of the minority from the tyranny of the majority.\n No, sets up a system of government. Have you read it? Protecting \"minority rights\" was a moot point compared to the overwhemingly important part about setting up a government.\n \n \n\n What if a \"majority\" decides to write a law ignoring that?\n Then what?\n \n Which \"majority\" do we listen to?\n \n I don't understand your question\n \n \n\n Do you have a link to this?\n Quite frankly, I take anything Justice Scalia says with a pillar of salt.\n You should take it as gold...but whatever. \n \n It was from a CSPAN speech....I can't really give a link to a quote as it is a video of him speaking for an hour.\n \n \nJudges take a variety of means to evaluate what is a \"right\".\n It's more than just the judge's opinion.\n Such as....\n \n \n\n And I think the issue here is not whether or not \"rights actually in the constitution\" will help minorities or not.\n The issue is ignoring legal concepts like equal protection and due process just because the majority says so. The issue is our founding fathers explicitly acknowledging that our constitutional rights are not a complete and exclusive list, and acknowledging the importance and the meaning of that.\n Don't try to get into a 9th amendment thing after we have three articles ripping up that argument. The issues is not equal protection and due process being ignored but what do they mean. Does due process have a substantive component to it? It didn't when written but does now...where did that come from? Does equal protection mean everything equal? Most certainly not...you can discriminate based on many things.",

   "I would respond to more of your post, but I won't have the time after I address this point. I thought I would speak to this point though.\n \n It takes 38 states for a Constitutional amendment to pass, which means if 13 states fail to ratify, the amendment does not pass. Now, suppose that amendment X comes before the states, and they vote on it. Suppose the number is as close as possible to ratifying - 37 for, and 13 against. Suppose further that the thirteen against were the 13 least populous states in the union. That would give us the following 13 states from least population to 13th least population (July 2005 Population Data).\n \n 1: Wyoming - 509,294\n 2: Vermont - 623,050\n 3: North Dakota - 636,677\n 4: Alaska - 663,661\n 5: South Dakota - 770,883\n 6: Delaware - 830,364\n 7: Montana - 926,865\n 8: Rhode Island - 1,080,632\n 9: Hawaii - 1,262,840\n 10: New Hampshire - 1,299,500\n 11: Maine - 1,317,253\n 12: Idaho - 1,393,262\n 13: Nebraska - 1,747,214\n \n Total the population of these 13 states, and you get 13,061,495 people.\n \n Now, divide that number by the total population in July 2005, which was 296,410,404.\n \n That gives us 0.044065575. Multiply by 100, and we get 4.406557538%.\n \n Thus, 4.41% of the population could stop a Constitutional Amendment.\n \n Maybe Scalia was wrong? Or......Maybe not.\n \n This would be assuming that 100% of the people in those 13 states opposed the amendment. However, it is also possible that only <50% of the people in all those states oppose the Amendment. Thus, we can redo our calculation.\n \n We can multiply all the state populations by 0.5000001 to give us a rough estimate of barely greater than a majority opposing the amendment in the 13 least populous states. Doing so, we get the following numbers:\n \n 1: Wyoming - 254647.0509\n 2: Vermont - 311525.0623\n 3: North Dakota - 318338.5637\n 4: Alaska - 331830.5664\n 5: South Dakota - 385441.5771\n 6: Delaware - 415182.083\n 7: Montana - 463432.5927\n 8: Rhode Island - 540316.1081\n 9: Hawaii - 631420.1263\n 10: New Hampshire - 649750.13\n 11: Maine - 658626.6317\n 12: Idaho - 696631.1393\n 13: Nebraska - 873607.1747\n \n Adding these numbers together, we get 6530748.806 people. Let's go ahead and round that to 6530749 people, since we can't have .806 people.\n \n Divide that number again by total population, 296,410,404. We get 0.022032793. Multiply it by 100, and we get 2.203279275%\n \n Thus, supposing that every state legislature listens to the majority of it's citizens, and supposing that only the least amount possible over 50% in the 13 least populous states oppose the amendment, 2.2% of the population could block a constitutional amendment.\n\n \n And I believe he stated that this was his biggest problem with the constitution. He felt it should be easier.",

Pointing to a few examples of where courts overruled a state law for the better does not show that the courts should have unlimited power to do things like that.
