   "I will not put up with people that scroll down to the end read the closing comments by the author and then proceed to argue.\n\n (I'm just curious what you mean by you 'will not put up with [it]'? You may have to put up with it, as there may be some people who choose to do that, and you have no control to stop them. Just as a suggestion, you may get further by asking respectfully that people not comment unless they have read the entire article. My two cents.)\n \n In this particular article, Mr. Alcorn does not back up any of his assertions with evidence. Some of what he states in this article is common knowledge that needs no documentation (i.e. a human fetus is human and it is alive). But in this article, he states many generalities, he states many opinions (to which there are alternate views), and he backs nothing up. I'm not saying that the facts he presents cannot be backed up, but until they are backed up with solid documentation, there are a lot of holes in what he is saying.\n \n For example:\n \"2f. There is substantial scientific reason to believe frozen embryos are persons, and should be granted the same rights as older, larger and less vulnerable persons.\"\n Substantial scientific reason??? Like what? A 'person' is not a scientific concept. Science does not identify the definitions of what can or cannot be labeled a 'person.' That is a legal and/or philisophical topic.\n \n \"3g. Even before the unborn is obviously human in appearance, she is what she is-a human being.\"\n Here again, a human being is not a scientific term. \n \n \"3e. Every abortion stops a beating heart and terminates measurable brain waves.\" \n This is not necessarily true. Mr. Alcorn also asserts that the birth control pill causes abortions prior to implantation of the blastocyst in the uterine lining. There is no beating heart or measurable brain activity at this stage of biological development. Both of his assertions, as stated, cannot be correct. If one statement is true, then the other must logically be false.\n \n \"5d. It is a scientific fact that there are thought processes at work in unborn babies. \" \n Where's the evidence? Define 'thought processes.' It may be a fact... that leaves open the possibility that it may not be true.\n \n \"5h. Arguments against the personhood of the unborn are shrouded in rationalization and denial. \" \n This is his opinion... to which he is entitled.\n \n \"9a. Once we grant that the unborn are human beings, it should settle the question of their right to live. \" \n True. But we have not yet granted that unborn are 'human beings.'\n \n \"13b. The poor choice of premarital sex is never compensated for by the far worse choice of killing an innocent human being.\" \n Again. This is merely Mr. Alcorn's opinion -- both that premarital sex is a 'poor choice' and the remainder of the statement.\n \n \"14a. Early feminists were prolife, not prochoice. \" \n Define 'early.' Are we talking back to the days of Eve? I don't believe Margaret Sanger was prolife.\n \n \"14d. The basic premises of the abortion-rights movement are demeaning to women. \" \n Unsupported opinion.\n \n \"17a. Every child is wanted by someone-there is no such thing as an unwanted child. \" \n How many children are on the street in this great country? How many children are waiting to be adopted? It may be true that all children are wanted by someone, but it is also true that there are many, many children without a home and without a family... who are being bounced around from foster home to foster home, not finding anyone who 'wants' them. This is fact. A dear friend of mine is a child protection social worker in a metropolitan area. She deals with this every day.\n \n \"18c. If children are viewed as expendable before birth, they will be viewed as expendable after birth. \" \n Not sure if I follow this one... if someone wants a child in the womb, they are not viewed as expendable before birth... if someone doesn't want a child in the womb and it is aborted, there won't be anything to be expendable after birth.\n \n \"20b. The dramatic decline in our birth rate will have a disturbing economic effect on America. \" \n Ummm... this may be true. It may not be true. Fact is... we don't know. We can only make educated guesses.\n \n I could go on... but I think my point has been made. One final one, though... I had to giggle when I read this one:\n \"Abortion has made us a nation of schizophrenics about our children.\"\n \n It seems that you are fervent in your beliefs that abortion is 'wrong.' I respect you for knowing what you believe and for standing up for it. Understand, though, that there are individuals who may disagree with you. To imply that they are 'wrong' and you are 'right' or they are ignorant or stupid or anything of the sort is a rather self-centered view of the world. In this mindset, it is possible that you are looking at everything from the 'wrong' perspective. Maybe the other person is actually 'right' and you are the ignorant one. (Note: I'm not suggesting that you are calling anyone stupid or ignorant... nor am I suggesting you are stupid or ignorant. I'm just making a point.)\n \n I challenge you to develop a logical argument -- based on facts with supporting evidence, and not based on opinions or 'moral ideals' -- that is so convincing that even the most 'pro-choice' person in the world could see (if they are being honest with themselves and the world) that abortion is 'wrong.'",

   "this is my favorite one-\n 2e. Human beings should not be discriminated against because of their place of residence.\n\n Mizmaxx -- Can you honestly tell me that you do not believe this statement? Or are you advocating the discrimination of human beings based upon their place of residence. This is actually, in my opinion, one of Mr. Alcorns strongest points. However, it is based upon the premise that a fetus is a 'human being' which is not established by law.\n \n \n \n28c. Clinic workers commonly prey on fear, pain, and confusion to manipulate women into getting abortions.\n\n While 'commonly' may or may not be true, this does end up happening at least some of the time (and possibly a lot of the time). It's highly doubtful that clinic workers do this with ill-intent... for example, a woman enters a clinic because she's confused and thinking about getting an abortion... she wants to consider the option of abortion, though she's not really comfortable with the idea. The clinic worker assures the woman that abortion is a painless procedure, and that lasting psychological effects rarely (if ever) occur. The clinic worker may ask the woman to think about how having a child would interfere with the woman's life. I'd encourage you to read the book \"Forbidden Grief\" by Theresa Burke. It is a fascinating look at real women who have had abortions, and the experiences they have gone through. Some of the women described in the book feel that they were manipulated by clinic workers into having an abortion. (In reality, short of physical force, no one can 'force' you to do something you don't want to do, but things can be said and done to mislead a person --intentionally or otherwise-- into thinking that's what they want themselves.)\n \n \n39a. Abortion has left terrible holes in our society.\n\n I thought about posting this one in my rebuttal as well... except that if you leave out the word 'terrible,' then this is a factual statement. Over the last 30 years, over 40,000,000 abortions have been performed in our country. IIRC, that's about 1 abortion for every 3 or 4 live births. The current birth rate is not sufficient to maintain our population -- if it were not for immigrants, I believe it is true that our population would be declining. As the baby-boomers age, the population base to support those individuals via Social Security is potentially as much as 20% smaller than it would be had all those abortions not occurred. Objectively speaking, there is a hole. Is it 'terrible'? That's a value judgement that you may or may not agree with.\n \n P.S. Mizmaxx - Forgive my ignorance if you have already posted this somewhere else... and please don't feel obligated to answer if you do not wish to share... but I am curious to know whether you have ever experienced an abortion. Again, please feel no obligation to even address this question -- it's not really my business, but some women don't mind sharing one way or another, so I thought I'd ask.",

I hate it when that happens!)\n \n I may not have made this clear, but here are the facts:\n 1) A unique human entity comes into existence at the point of conception/fertilization. It is pointless to argue this fact, because the evidence to suggest that this is true is insurmountable. The zygote/blastocyst/embryo/fetus/neonate/baby/child (whichever label you choose) is a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens. Period.\n 2) Just because something is human does not necessarily make it a 'human being' or a 'person.' These are not scientific terms. It is impossible to 'prove' that a pre-birth human entity is a 'human being' under all possible interpretations of a 'human being.' The argument could be made, for example, that a 'being' must have some sort of self-awareness. It would be quite difficult to find evidence that suggests that a developing human blastocyst has any self-awareness.\n \n So, to answer your question, regardless of what anyone believes, a post-conception entity formed from a human sperm and a human ovum is a unique human entity from that point on.\n \n My question to you: What do you consider to be the reason the pre-birth baby is a 'human being' that deserves 'personhood' according to the law?",

Although I think it's unfortunate that some women may have been or felt manipulated into having an abortion, I think this is no more likely to occur with abortion than with any other medical decision, and a couple of people's lack of ethics do not equal an endemic problem. \n \n I've known numerous women who have had abortions, and have actually assisted herbal abortions, and in no case have people reported that the clinicians tried to make abortion sound like the only or best option. In fact, one woman complained that the nurse kept saying \"are you sure?\", and another (who was brought up Catholic), was upset because I think she was hoping that the counsellor would make her feel better about the issue, but kept saying \"the decision is yours, noone can make it for you and you are the one who will have to live with it either way\". Both went through with the procedures anyway, BTW. Having worked in a women's centre I can tell you that we were very explicitly instructed not to advise people in any direction, but to give them information and resources and support if someone was pressuring them. \n \n There was only one complaint in that vein, and that was from my Catholic friend who felt she wanted some kind of emotional support according to her tradition, and could not get any resources for that. She ended up getting a pagan book (by Starhawk) about death and dying, and did a ritual from that book.\n \n \nThe current birth rate is not sufficient to maintain our population -- if it were not for immigrants, I believe it is true that our population would be declining. \n\n \n But it isn't, because of immigration, so what's the problem?

   "... which is an irrelevant point re: abortion.\n\n It is not necessarily irrelevant. It is very relevant to anyone who believes the a pre-birth human entity is a 'human being' with equal rights as any other human being. And the opinion that it ISN'T a human being is no more valid or invalid than the opinion that it IS a human being.\n \n \nNot to mention that I don't think you actually agree with this statement in general terms. People are discriminated against based on place of residence all the time. Homeless people, for example.\n\n \"Human beings should not be discriminated against because of their place of residence.\"\n \n I would guess that we would agree in general terms that for post-birth human entities, this statement is a very reasonable statement. This doesn't preclude the fact that some human beings ARE discriminated against because of their place of residence... but assuming we are standing up for what is 'fair' and 'just,' then we can say that no human being *should* be discriminated against. This point isn't really central to the debate, but if we still don't have a mutual understanding, feel free to continue to discuss it.\n \n \n \nA coma patient is physically attached to life support for their very survival. What about that statement do you disagree with?\n\n Actually, nothing. You made a point that the entity was not 'residing' in the womb. I am suggesting that this is a point of semantics that depends on the definition of the word 'reside.' It is quite correct to say that the entity resides in the womb, just as it is correct to say that my trophy resides on the shelf. Whether or not the entity is considered a person, it is still physically located in the womb, and therefore the womb is its 'residence.' This doesn't preclude that the entity is a parasite feeding off of the mother, because it is! \n \n \nFurther, although artificial 'life support' is possible in response to trauma or medical condition, a blastocyst/foetus/embryo is not ill, but in a stage of human development where their system is literally fused to another organism. I think these are different situations.\n\n I agree. I think they are different, too. But they are similar on some levels, nonetheless. Also, though I am certain you are aware of this, please note that their 'system,' while it relies on another organism for nourishment, oxygen, and a safe environment, quite literally possesses its own 'system' that is unique and separate from the mother.\n \n \n \nOne woman's experience does not empirical evidence make.\n\n Actually, according to the common usage of the word 'empirical,' her observations and experience ARE considered empirical evidence. I don't believe you would suggest that clinic workers never take advantage of a woman's fear, pain, or confusion to manipulate them (intentionally or otherwise) into getting an abortion. Remember, that even if this happens once, this statement is proven false. If it happens even once, then it happens 'some of the time.' Dr. Burke counsels many women who feel that they have been manipulated by clinic workers into getting abortions. Therefore, my statement stands.\n \n \n \nI think such a book might be useful for an organization where this might be a problem... Medical malpractice is a problem, but there is no evidence that it is particular to family planning clinics.\n\n Ahh, but we're not talking about medical malpractice! We're talking about simple answers to simple questions that a woman in an abortion clinic may ask the clinic workers, such as in the experience of Jane:\n \"I remember asking many questions before my abortion. All my questions were brushed aside as 'nothing to worry about.' I asked how far my baby had developed. The counselor pressed her pencil on a paper, making a micro-dot. 'That's what the 'product of conception' looks like,' she said. I was 12 weeks along in my pregnancy... As I learned the truth in nursing school, I can't tell you how betrayed I felt.\" (Burke 43)\n \n \n \nLogic.\n\n And by 'logic' I suggest that it may be even more likely to happen with abortion than other medical decisions.\n \n \nYou have made an assertion, but you haven't proved it. Therefore, I don't believe you.\n\n If you accept Jane's story as described by Dr. Burke as valid evidence, then, yes, I have proven my assertion. You still don't have to believe me, though.\n \n \n \nMaybe. Then again, think of all the wasted sperm thrown out or flushed daily. Those are millions of potential children. What about the children who people have later in life, after aborting a child they couldn't have? If they had kept the first child, the second wouldn't exist- more \"holes\"?\n\n In actuality, those millions (or even billions?) of sperm are just that: sperm. You could make a case that they are a piece that is necessary to create a child, thereby making them 'potential children.' But sperm are not unique human entities that have everything they need to grow and develop into an adult member of the species (save oxygen, nourishment and a safe environment). A sperm that has joined with an ovum to fertilize it IS a unique human entity that... blah, blah, blah.\n \n In your second example, the second child may or may not come into existence. We don't know. Regardless in both of these examples, you are basing your arguments on potentiality. I am not interested in discussing potentiality. An abortion cannot terminate something that does not exist in reality but is only potential. No! An abortion, by definition, terminates something real with physical existence. Had that entity never been formed in the first place, there would be no void. Since that entity has been formed, it's destruction creates a physical void where it would have continued to grow. Note that I am not suggesting this is 'good' or 'bad,' just that it IS.\n \n \n \nArguably the foetus is as much a \"potential\" person as sperm is.\n \n Arguably, I'll allow you that. But it's a very weak argument. A sperm will never grow into anything unless it fertilizes an egg. Once an egg is fertilized, there is no longer a physical entity of a sperm, but rather a new entity is created that is a unique member of the species, and it needs nothing except nourishment, oxygen, and a safe environment in order to grow and develop. Granted, some percentage of fertilized eggs do NOT grow and develop into an adult member of the species due to various reasons, but that does not mean that they don't posess everything necessary to do so. \n ***Incidentally, the requirements that a zygote needs to survive (Food, O2, and safe environment) are the same needs that you or I have to survive. Though I am not arguing for this here, it certainly sounds like a zygote is more of a potential person than a sperm is!\n \n \nYour definition of \"holes\" is now too convenient- how can a \"hole\" be created only through \"intentional\" destruction? What about the half of pregnancies that spontaneously abort before the third week because of health problems? What about those \"holes\"?\n \n First, I am open to another definition of the word 'hole.' But in order to continue to discuss this point, we must have an agreed-upon definition. That's why I posed the one I did. Spontaneous abortions or miscarriages do cause a void. A physical entity is terminated. But those would still happen whether or not intentional abortions occurred. We weren't discussing spontaneous abortions. We are discussing intentional abortions. \n \n Over 40,000,000 intentional abortions have occurred in the U.S.A. over the past 30 years or so. Had those intentional abortions not occurred, there would be about 40 million more residents of our country. That's all I'm saying. I don't think that statement is reasonably debatable (assuming you allow for a margin of error). Today, there are about 40 million fewer residents of our country than there would be had 40,000,000 abortions not occurred. But 40,000,000 abortions have occurred, so there are 40,000,000 people that are not alive today as a direct result of intentional abortions. It's really not a controversial statement. It just is.\n \n \nThe truth is, every time we make a decision, something is destroyed that could have been. This doesn't create societal \"holes\", this is the fundamental nature of the universe.\n\n I don't disagree with you here. But please allow me a distinction in that sometimes those decisions destroy something 'potential' that 'could have been,' and sometimes those decisions destroy something that is already in existence. \n \n Abortion destroys a unique member of our species that is already in existence. Again, let me stress I am not imposing a moral value on this, but rather I am accepting it for what it is. I really don't think this statement is debateable, either. Look at the biological life cycle of a member of our species. Look at what abortion physically does. There is nothing controversial about saying that an abortion terminates the physical development of a unique member of our species, right?",

The average number per year peaked in the 90's, I believe, and has been decreasing rather steadily since then. Currently, I believe the number is about 1.4 million abortions performed per year in this country. If you want a source, try abortionfacts.com. (Yes, I realize this can be perceived to be an anti-abortion website. That doesn't negate the reality of the number of abortions that are performed according to hospital and clinic records.

Abortion terminates the development of a physical entity that is already in existence. That statement, as it stands, cannot be argued. What you can argue is the value of that physical entity, and whether or not it would grow into a valuable member of our society, or a burden to our society. This is not reality. The reality is the physical destruction. Everything else is mere speculation.",

Henshaw and Kathryn Kost, Family Planning Perspectives, Volume 28, No. 4, July/August 1996.)\n\n At some point in time I'd like to create a new post that discusses this general theme. I have no reason to doubt the validity of these statistics, by the way. But back to the topic at hand... 66% of women who plan to have more children after an abortion does not negate the fact that that an abortion occurred.\n \n \nSperm exists as a physical entity. Flushing sperm down the toilet terminates the development of a physical entity that is already in existence.\n\n Yes, yes... of course sperm exists as a physical entity. I have never suggested or even implied that it doesn't. It is very real. You can see it, touch it, etc... Yes, sperm gets flushed down the toilet or spilled or swallowed or whatever all the time. I do not dispute this. According to my definition, a 'hole' is also created by the destruction of sperm. As is the case with abortion, I am not placing a value on the destruction of sperm. It is what it is.\n \n Here is the distinction I am making:\n \n The sperm does not have the capacity, as it exists, to grow into an adult member of the species. The sperm, as it exists, will die as a unique sperm. A fertilized egg is not a sperm. A zygote is a unique entity that is created by the sperm fertilizing the egg. Once a zygote has been created, a physical entity is in existence to which nothing will be added except oxygen and nourishment in order to grow into an adult member of the species. A human zygote is what a member of our species is called in its earliest stage of biological development. A sperm is necessary in order for this stage of development to occur, but a sperm by itself does not constitute a unique human entity that will grow into an adult member of the species.\n \n Really, Mizmaxx... I am not saying anything controversial. I am simply saying what is. And according to the definition I posed for a hole, abortion does create a hole. \n \n But I think we're really getting side-tracked into a semantics debate here. If you wish to continue discussing the hole, I would like to propose three options (though more certainly exist): 1) Accept the definition and the fact that according to said definition a hole exists; 2) Create a new definition for hole however you like, and then we can determine whether or not a hole exists according to your definition; or 3) We can just discuss other, more productive, topics. :-)",
