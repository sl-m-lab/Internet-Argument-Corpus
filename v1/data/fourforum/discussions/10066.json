Spend a few days near an enclave of illegals and you'd likely change your mind. There are areas within several cities that have been silently invaded and are in the process of being completely overrun with uncontrolled illegal aliens who seem to form their own in-your-face local government that effectively says, 'screw you, gringo!' to law enforcement.\n \n Unless you advocate anarchy, you cannot logically be in favor of continued lack of border control and enforcement of immigration laws.\n \n I would not excuse the Brits who have overstayed their visas either. They should go home, too...even though I seldom hear of gangs of British thugs taking over communities in the US. They have still broken our laws, they are still illegal aliens and they should either go home peacefully or be deported.",

Most of our illegal aliens come from Mexico and are quite properly called Mexicans. Your failure to understand that is not surprising to me.",

   "But simply being in the US illegally makes them criminals that need be hunted down and dealt with severely, doesn't it? \n\n Attempting to put words in my mouth? emoticon_rolleyes But, since you asked, \"yes\" simply being here illegally makes them criminals. We do have laws against illegal immigration, even where you live. ;) \n \n\n I bet if we sweep the English pubs we'd snare a mess of Brits that have overstayed their tourist visas too. Criminals like that cannot go unpunished.\n\n \n Go for it. If they're here illegally, \"get the Hell out!\" emoticon_xagree",

   "Did you notice that the right wing fanatics are only calling for the southern border to be secure. In their opinion \"white people good brown people bad\"\n\n \n I suppose it could be racially motivated...or it could just eb that they recognize that the vast majority of our illegal immigrants are coming over the southern border. Canada has a bigger problem with US citizens immigrating illegally than the Us does with canadians. \n \n Obviously canadians who are in the country illegally should be deported just like anybody else, but if we are going to spend money trying to secure the border, it makes a lot more sense to work on the southern border where the problem is first.",
