This is blatent discrimination, how much longer will this country put up with it? \n \n http://www.advocate.com/news_detail.asp?id=32062\n \n The Navy is kicking out a lesbian noncommissioned officer who took part in a New York City rally for marriage equality last weekend, after she was heard on a local radio station talking about her female partner. Navy petty officer Rhonda Davis was in uniform when she gave the interview to 1010WINS on June 3, as she marched across the Brooklyn Bridge with hundreds of others in support of same-sex marriage.\n \n Davis said she is now losing her job because her superiors heard the broadcast. Navy spokesman Jeff Nichols confirmed that discharge proceedings are under way, adding that Davis's broadcast comments violated the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.\n \n Davis, a 10-year Navy veteran and currently serving as a journalist first class, said she's hoping to get an honorable, not a dishonorable, discharge. She said Saturday's rally was the first time she had marched in support of gay rights-and that even though she's not happy about losing her job, she has no regrets about speaking out because she believes strongly in the fight to legalize same-sex marriage.",

Nevertheless, it does seem wrong\n\n It \"seems wrong\" to you because you start from a presumption that homosexuality is wrong.\n \n The problem is not \"some of the same things\" as having women on the front lines. If it were, then the gays could be kicked out just because they couldn't DO THEIR JOB. And if a gay man, or straight man, in the military cannot do their job, I urge the military to kick them out.\n But claiming that an ENTIRE GROUP is to be assumed as being unable to serve on the front lines is nonsense.\n \n And \"the situation of quartering the troops\" CURRENTLY exists. Gays are IN the military. They typically behave themselves. If they don't and try to sexually harrass people, kick them out. Same goes for straights...\n \n And the really obvious point is that OTHER COUNTRIES allow gays in the military.\n Can you point to ANY country which allows gays in the military which has these types of problems?\n No. It's obvious that you're just tossing out hypothetical problems with no desire to see if they're real. It's much safer to assume that a group is guilty and refuse them a job, isn't it. How \"American\"!\n \n \n NONE of these things you brought up are real. They're simply excuses.\n There was a study put forward by the executive branch which demonstrated that gays serving in the military is viable.

Time was that it was thought that men would be unable to control themselves if they saw too much female flesh. Also, the \"reputation\" of an unchaperoned woman in the presence of a man would be shot. We've outgrown alot of that thinking, but not all of it. And we certainly haven't outgrown all the traditions and taboos that came about due to that thinking. As for gays, they weren't even supposed to exist. Merely being was taboo for them, so no other specific taboos, like showering, were needed. That's why men and women showering together is a \"big deal\" but straight and gay men isn't.
