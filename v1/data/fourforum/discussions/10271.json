There is nothing there to debate! As a thought experiment take the matter or the motion out of the picture and what do you get - well its not life is it?\n \n \n\"Random mutation and natural selection\" is the only materialist explanation anyone has suggested. \n \n \n Nope, there have been many other suggestions along the road.

None proved satisfactory however.\n \n \nAccording RM&NS all creativity is the result of genomic accidents.\n \n \n No is the only answer one can make to that claim - its false. Indeed there is no claim made within NDS to \"creativity\" at all. NDS does not to deal with creativity which is a mental process. NDS deals with plain old biology. Evolution does not require creativity although NS does provide a non-random element to the process.\n \n \nThen \"natural selection somehow organizes a bunch of such accidents into rational, complex, biological systems.\n\n \n Well no. NS only provides a sorting function and only a partial sorting at that. That which reproduces better survives better than that which does not. Simple as that more or less. There is no \"organization\" involved since organization is again a mental concept not a law of nature.\n \n \n If intelligent organization of any form, including intelligent self-organization were acknowledged, life could be described as \"intelligently designed\". Or do Darwinists argue that life can accidentally self-organize?\n\n \n When and if you can convince me that the metaphorical pond scum had brains , intelligence, intent, free-will, and suffient knowledge to build better pond scum in an intelligent self-directed way then we have something to talk about. Till then you are simply going down a dead end road.\n \n And by the way self-organizing systems are not what one would call accidental, they arise because of the laws of physics and chemistry. Matter itslef is inherently self-organizing and given time complex organized structures are the result under certain regimes of temperature, pressure, chemical composition etc.",
