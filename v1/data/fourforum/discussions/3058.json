   "Hi Maxwell:\n \n Thank you very much for proving this section with definitions of the primary terms. Please allow me to apply some of this information to the words Homosexual, Heterosexual and Asexual, which all have 'sex' as the root of the word. You wrote:\n \n \nMain Entry: 1sex \n Pronunciation: 'seks\n Function: noun\n Etymology: Middle English, from Latin sexus\n 1 : either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male\n 2 : the sum of the structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of living things that are involved in reproduction by two interacting parents  and that distinguish males and females\n 3 a : sexually motivated phenomena or behavior b : SEXUAL INTERCOURSE\n 4 : GENITALIA \n \n \n The first (1) definition defines female or male  as these two individual forms. Therefore, by definition every person alive today is either female or male. The second (2) definition includes the specific characteristics of living beings by their ability to reproduce. So parents reproduce either females or males of our species. Definition three (3a) pertains to the phenomena or behavior of 'sex,' as in \"having sex.\" This definition is restricted in its scope by definitions (1) and (2), where 'sex' is a behavioral characteristic involved in reproduction of the species. And (3b) is the 'act' of having 'sex,' again, about reproduction. The final (4) definition pertains to the sex organs; again, of the male and female of the species from the definitions above.\n \n \nHeterosexual:\n \n Maxwell quotes << Main Entry: heter-\n Variant(s): or hetero-\n Function: combining form\n Etymology: Middle French or Late Latin; Middle French, from Late Latin, from Greek, from heteros; akin to Greek heis one -- more at SAME\n 1 : other than usual : other : different  <heterophyllous<\n 2 : containing atoms of different kinds <heterocyclic< \n \n \n This primitive definition of our prefix means 'different,' or 'other.' Add the suffix (ual) and we have a word that describes people of different sexes (male and female) according to their ability to reproduce. Thus Hetero-Sex-ual.\n \n \nAsexual:\n \n Main Entry: asex\u0095u\u0095al \n Pronunciation: (\")A-'sek-sh(&-)w&l, -'sek-sh&l\n Function: adjective\n 1 : lacking sex or functional sex organs <asexual plants<\n 2 a : involving or reproducing by reproductive processes  (as cell division, spore formation, fission, or budding) that do not involve the union of individuals or germ cells <asexual reproduction< <an asexual generation< b : produced by asexual reproduction <asexual spores<\n 3 : devoid of sexuality <an asexual relationship< \n \n \n Here again, the 'sex' part of the word causes the definition to include \"reproducing by reproductive processes . . .\" Both Heterosexual and Asexual organisms are classified by how they reproduce. That is the common trait of both words that contain the root 'sex.' \n \n \nMain Entry: 1ho\u0095mo\u0095sex\u0095u\u0095al \n Pronunciation: \"hO-m&-'sek-sh(&-)w&l, -'sek-sh&l\n Function: adjective\n 1 : of, relating to, or characterized by a tendency to direct sexual desire toward another of the same sex\n 2 : of, relating to, or involving sexual intercourse between persons of the same sex.\n\n \n Right here is where the dictionary fails to hold to the rules of grammar. As defined above, the root 'sex' appears to signify a means of reproduction. The word homosexual here is void of such language. In fact, these words 'sexual desire' are wrongly used to describe this behavior. Homosexual activities do not involve reproductive processes. This word does not accurately classify anyone according to their 'sex.' \n \n Homosexual is not an accurate scientific term that describes any living thing on this planet. The joining of two sperm cells or female eggs will never produce a 'homosexual' male or female. By these definitions it is impossible for two people of the same sex to have 'sexual intercourse.' Instead, every living person on this planet is either a heterosexual male, or a heterosexual female by definition. They can call themselves homosexual males and females in the same way that people call themselves all sorts of things. The problem is that being male and female places them solidly within the heterosexual group.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Hi Maxwell:\n \n \nYou wrote << Apparently we have a major problem in understanding basic definitions (not to mention fallacies)\n\n \n It is often helpful to define the terms in the debate from neutral widely accepted resources. That gives each side of the debate some common ground on which to present their opposing arguments. \n \n \nMaxwell << If one definition grammatically, semantically and for all general purposes, correctly describes the behavior, it is therefore correct.\n\n \n Definition number 1 of what? And what is 'the behavior? I must guess and figure that you are talking about the definition of 'Hetero,' as this is the first of your four definitions. \n \n The dictionary is not defining a 'behavior' by saying that 'hetero' means 'different,' or 'other.' This is simply the prefix in the word 'heterosexual.' The prefix simply means 'different' in the way that 'heterocyclic' means 'containing atoms of different kinds.' Therefore, instead of describing behavior, it is describing a characteristic pertaining to the root word. \n \n It is your preconceived notion that 'hetero' is describing behavior, and thus, your original premise is already proven, which is, \"Apparently we have a major problem in understanding basic definitions (not to mention fallacies).\"\n \n \nMaxwell << If the 2nd defintion grammatically, semantically and for all general purposes, correctly describes the behavior, it is therefore correct.\n \n \n By second definition, you must be referring to the prefix 'homo,' which means nothing more than 'same.' The prefix 'homo' is not describing any behavior. Just like with the word 'hetero,' it is describing a characteristic of the root word 'sex,' or 'same sex.' This is where the problem lies for the accurate use of the word 'homosexual.' You did not include any language here about 'sex,' so I will add that part for you. \n \n \nMain Entry: 1sex \n Pronunciation: 'seks\n Function: noun\n Etymology: Middle English, from Latin sexus\n 1 : either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male\n 2 : the sum of the structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of living things that are involved in reproduction by two interacting parents and that distinguish males and females\n 3 a : sexually motivated phenomena or behavior b : SEXUAL INTERCOURSE\n 4 : GENITALIA\n\n \n Are we on the same page regarding the two groups in our species called 'male and female?' Do we understand the meaning of 'characteristics of living things that are involved with reproduction' by the same two groups of males and females of our species? Did you catch the part about 'parents' and how that term is a vital part of the definition of the word 'sex?' That is because both groups of all males and females on this planet are reproductions of their parents, who are themselves each one member of each group. Now you can understand the true meaning of the term 'heterosexual,' and how that word applies to every living human being on this planet. \n \n Maxwell << If both are correct under their own circumstances, neither is a fallacy.\n \n We agree. Neither the prefix 'hetero' or 'homo' is a fallacy or myth. The term 'heterosexual' accurately describes every male and female on this planet. However, the term 'homosexual' accurately describes no living thing at all. The product of two homosexual males is nothing. The product of two homosexual females is nil. Since Gay folks do not and shall never reproduce in nature, the root word 'sex' is inaccurately part of Homosexual. This is an English oddity indeed. And thus, \"The Fallacy of Homosexuality.\"\n \n \nMaxwell << The fact that we are arguing over stupid grammar in this forum says much about those who start the attacks using the foundation of grammar.\n\n \n This word 'attack' is being thrown around like a beach ball in these 'Gay Rights' threads. Why is it that when someone disagrees with your viewpoints, then your person is being attacked? The dictionary definition for 'heterosexual' and 'asexual' are presented exactly according to the rules of grammar. 'Homosexual' is the oddball; go figure. \n \n GL,\n \n Terral",

This definition says nothing of the phenomena of actual success in the attempt of reproduction, let alone the use of reproductive organs for means other than reproduction. It is moreover an assumptive definition.\n\n \n The deep end? Heh. We agree that the definition of sex says nothing about the success of reproduction. Definition (3a) has restrictions placed upon it, because of the use of 'sexual,' which also has the root 'sex.' So this definition is bound by the language of definitions (1) and (2). The fact that definition (3a) is assumptive is based upon the use of 'sex' as part of the definition, which it just defined above as including 'reproduction.' \n \n \nOriginally Posted by terral03 << The final (4) definition pertains to the sex organs; again, of the male and female of the species from the definitions above. \n \n \n \nJustine << Indeed, but it says nothing of those organs actually ability to succeed in reproduction or their ability to function in such a way as to produce offspring.

My statements are about the word \"hetero - sex - ual.\" The reproductive language comes from the word 'sex,' as defined above in the second (2) definition.

Am I assuming that the words, \"reproducing by reproductive processes\" appear there? Manoman, Justine. Animals that reproduce through cell division have no sex cells. By definition, these plants or animals are classified as Asexual, because they have no sex organs. The word 'sex' implies male and female by definition.

I simply pointed out that 'by these definitions' everyone here is a heterosexual male or female. \n \n Were you born to heterosexual parents? Guess what? All of your Gay friends were also born the same way. Is this a coincidence? No, because, everyone on this planet was born to heterosexual males and females.

Something you are failing to do. \n \n \nDefinition number 1 of what? And what is 'the behavior?\n\n \n Hom means of the same. Sexual means of or relating to members of one or the other sex. It is semantically and grammatically correct. \n \n \nThe dictionary is not defining a 'behavior' by saying that 'hetero' means 'different,' or 'other.' \n\n \n So now you're changing the subject? \n Your defintion of heterocylic is off (not to mention selective, like the rest of your arguments)\n \n Main Entry: het\u00b7ero\u00b7cy\u00b7clic \n Pronunciation: \"he-t&-rO-'sI-klik, -'si-\n Function: adjective\n Etymology: International Scientific Vocabulary\n : relating to, characterized by, or being a ring composed of atoms of more than one kind\n \n \nThe prefix 'homo' is not describing any behavior.\n\n \n But we were not discussion behavior. We were discussing definitions. The definition of homo means of the same. The definition of homosexual is correct regardless of behavior. \n \n \n You did not include any language here about 'sex,' so I will add that part for you. \n\n \n the definition that the term uses is of the two different genders, not about reproduction. \n \n \n Do we understand the meaning of 'characteristics of living things that are involved with reproduction' by the same two groups of males and females of our species? \n\n \n I'm not saying your defintion is incorrect, but saying that mine is correct, and your calling of it as a fallacy is wrong. You have a hard time admitting that my defintion is correct in grammar, semantics and from the dictionar\n \n \nHowever, the term 'homosexual' accurately describes no living thing at all. \n\n \n Of or relating to members of the same sex. I can think of plenty of people who that accurately describes. Mcgreevy for one. \n \n \nSince Gay folks do not and shall never reproduce in nature, the root word 'sex' is inaccurately part of Homosexual. \n\n \n Sex is not solely defined as reproduction. You have a problem understanding that. \n \n \nThis is an English oddity indeed. And thus, \"The Fallacy of Homosexuality.\"\n\n \n Your inability to admit that the words you are using have more then one defintion does not make it a fallacy. \n \n You do have a excellent ability to argue at a very superficial level though.",

That's dangerous...I had to get counseling and reassurance that it wasn't true. That America was still free and that our public servants would keep in mind that although the majority of Americans are Christian, my rights wouldn't get run over by them.\n\n \n Please allow me to apologize for my remarks that included homosexual, without the 'sexual' part (adding back the s to make it plural). That was a bad choice of terms. Hopefully you have noticed that this derogatory term has been removed from my vocabulary. Next, please realize that I have lost multiple family members to aids from gay people who knew they were infected. My next door neighbor growing up died from aids years ago, and one of my best friends. While I try not to take this out on the entire group, Christians are also human, and our emotions sometimes get in the way. \n \n BTW, some of my friends who thought they were gay during their teens now have families. That is why I will always hold that being gay is in the mind, and about choice. And that is why gay folks deserve no extra rights. Suppose you meet the right guy and become the happiest gal on earth? Next year you are sitting on my side of the table. \n \n If you wish to poll the members of congress, you will find that a majority of them are professing Christians and are in church most every Sunday. Our laws have been created by mostly professing Christians from day one of this great nation. This is part of the reason that gay folks enjoy the rights of freedom of expression, and all the other liberties the rest of us enjoy. That being said, I disagree with most of the Gay Rights propaganda being touted on this forum. Therefore, you should expect to find me on the opposite side of the table in our discussions; you on the Pro side, me on the Con side.\n \n Personal attacks appear when one side starts running out of arguments. So always look for that in your debating opponent as a very good sign. This form of freedom of expression is not for the thin-skinned. Folks on the right side of the debate are supposed to have it easier. That is our incentive to join any discussion on what 'we' perceive as the group with the most merit. If you are struggling with these things to the point of seeking counsel from others, then perhaps it is time to rethink your position. That is the difference between someone testing their skills in a forum of debate, and the skilled debating professional. My duties and loyalties are to my Creator, His Word, Country, Family, Posterity and that voice of conscience inside stirring me on. \n \n God bless you,\n \n Terral",

If we condemn something for good reason, that is one thing. However, you are condemning being gay without question, simply because a book or an authority figure such as a religious leader tells you to, and for no logical, thoughtful, reason.

I don't believe being gay is like being an alcoholic, because being gay is simply an attraction to men or to women, like being straight is also. An alcoholic however, is always an alcoholic. There are compelling reasons for him not to indulge in alcohol, because his behaviour is harmful. The same could be said of smoking. There is not reason to never act on being gay, other than the other arguments based only on blind obedience out of fear and threats that I discussed earlier. Abortion isn't harmful to a sentient human person. How do we condemn pornography? Pornographers don't have fewer rights unless they are directly harming others such as children.",

If a sinner can be called in from his wicked ways, he is due to be blessed.\n\n \n What is technically sin changes from era to era. Going to the bathroom indoors was once a sin.
