   "In truth, we don't know WHAT Obama is gonna do or not do, since you can sooner get a straight hind leg off of a dog, than a straight answer out of Obama; he goes by the old tried-and-true politician's formula of \"speak much, but say nothing\" in order to appear wise and saintly by speaking only in obscure \"Emperor's Robe\" pompous speeches.\n He clearly says whatever he thinks will get him the result he wants; he's a complete and utter pragmatist, even more than Bill Clinton the textbook sociopath (and I know, because I was studying those textbooks when Bill ran in '92-- he fit every criterion like a case-example). Obama does even more.\n \n So you don't know what he's going to do, since everything he says is a lie (except by coincidence)-- but I can make some predictions:\n \n 2008: Beginning on election-night, Obama begins backpedalling like Lance Armstrong headed for a cliff; he begins immediately re-phrasing EVERY promise he made, telling everyone that they \"misunderstood his goals\" and other double-talk which basically means \"remember all that stuff I said for the past 2 years? SCREW YOU!!!\"\n Naturally, his supporters just say \"He said what he had to say, and did what he had to do, in order to save the world-- so it's ok; ALL politicians do it.\"\n 2009: Obama passes an executive order authorizing gay marriage by every administrative office. He then tries to pull the same \"big leader\" stuff with Congress; they refuse to listen to a word he says, but just demand pork for their respective districts; they put him in his place, seeing him as a naive upstart.\n Likewise, Michelle Obama tries to pass socialized health-care: the voters BLOCK it.\n Obama passes massive tax-hikes, the biggest tax-increase in history. The DNC-controlled congress erupts with thunderous applause.\n 2010: People get outraged, vote in an all-GOP congress; the Right wing celebrates. Obama begins his campaign for re-election.\n 2011: With the GOP holding both houses of Congress, Barack is the only DNC voice left in Washington, so the entire media and left wing WORSHIP the ground he walks on, as \"the people's champion against the right wing.\" He blocks some tax-and-spending cuts as \"draconian and mean-spirited,\" but later passes them-- and takes full credit for their benefits to the economy.\n 2012: Obama wins re-election against a 2nd-rate GOP candidate-- thanks to help from the media, and selling White-house time to listen to lobby-groups for $1500/minute.\n 2013: Obama continues his foreign policy of \"soft-touchy-feely\" pacifism and kum-ba-ya grandiose speeches, preaching world peace and ignoring wholesame massacre; he cozies up with dictators, and simply downplays world violence. The media hails him as a second coming-- but some third-world terrorist sees him as a schmuck-patsy. Obama, wanting to avoid getting a bad name, trades US national security for world goodwill; he guts the military, destroys military intelligence, and attacks any security-proposals as \"paranoid right-wing war-mongering.\"\n 2014: Obama, thinking he can do no wrong, engages in some major scandal; while the evidence against him is solid, the media accuses the GOP of \"trying to overturn an election.\" Michelle Obama calls it a \"conspiracy.\"\n 2016: A GOP president-- probably Romney-- defeats Joe Biden in a close match. Michelle Obama runs for senate, and wins.\n 2017: Osama Bin Laden (or someone similar) strikes again, in a plan, which was being orchestrated under Obama for years; however, no one blames Obama in the slightest, despite his years of gutting US security and fleeing from battle around the globe, giving the US the reputation for a paper tiger.\n 2018: The US passes \"The Loyalty Act,\" and is plunged into a police-state; X-rays and high-tech identification of people at airports, subways, are common; the people sheepishly accept this as \"loyalty,\" and out of paranoid hype after \"2017.\"\n \n \n You get the picture: those who fail to learn the lessons of history, flunk it and repeat next term.",

What I can expect from him would be to \"try\" to help stabilize the economy just like George Bush and congress have tried these past few months. I'm sure that will be the first things they will work on. I'm guessing for about the 1st half of his Presidency. Of course how he and congress would go about that, I do not know. I have very little faith in Pelosi mainly because she's just too partisan. For Obama...hm I do not know him well enough to make a decision whether he will kiss up to Pelosi or not. We'll see. Then after that I'm sure we might see something regarding taxes. Most likely he will keep that promise of taxing those that earn more then 250,000 thousand dollars. Would this be bad? I'm not sure, but I'm sure lots of those in the lower part of that earning section are going to feel it...and HARD. I think if he really wanted to tax someone it should be foreign imports..but hey that's just my idea. Also regarding healthcare my guess, that is if he really is the centrist he says he is, he will give tax incentives to those that get healthcare, in other words a credit. I think that would be a better solution IMHO. I do not have much faith in the US Gubament (yes I know) handling health care. I sure hope though, he tries nothing with gun control, because that will cost him and the dems some votes and quite possibly seats in the Senate and House. I'm sure most of those Democrats from rural states will not be voting for a gun ban or anything like that.

   "Another opinion", 
   "I think any changes Obama introduces will be evolutionary rather than revolutionary - i.e. incremental changes. That is apparently how people who have worked with him in the past see his style. \n \n Where taxes and the economy is concerned, he will continue the recent government trend of short term increase in debt in order to keep the US economy from sinking too low into a deeper recession or depression. I have already read that he will postpone his negation of the Bush's tax cuts (that would have increased taxes on the rich and upper middle class). However, I would not be surprised if he did carry through with this, along with his middle class tax cut, by 2010, as long as the economy stabilizes.\n \n Where his health plan is concerned, I suspect that the economic problems will force him to scale back or delay those plans as well. We will already need to get into enough extra debt to forestall major economic problems. Nevertheless, relatively speaking, his health care plan isn't all that expensive - factcheck.org estimates it at ~$50 to ~$100 billion, so I would not be surprised if he did try to push that (or a scaled-down program) through in the ~2010 timeframe or a bit later. Either way, I have 100% confidence that he will not try to push us into a system of purely socialized medicine - the great majority of us will keep the same style of private health insurance that we already do. However, I think he will try to introduce some new regulations to force private health insurers to accept people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n \n I think that those who were most elated around the world will find that he represents less of a change than they are hoping. Africans, Asians, Muslims and, of course, African Americans all think of him in a sense as one of them and I suspect that all of them expect that he will show some favoratism. That will simply not be the case. Obama will not be playing favorites or give special favors and this will be certain to disappoint many. Also, his support for expanding the war in Afghanistan, continued support for Israel (though I am not sure how one-sided that is), and his less beligerent but still strong rhetoric against Iran will all be exagerated to the hilt by extremists, who might succeed in convincing the local populations that he is just like previous presidents. Be that as it may, I think that, despite a dying down of the world's initial euphoria, they will be sufficiently sattisfied as long as he makes positive changes and avoids the bullying, unilateral, and ideologic style of the Bush administration.\n \n Where internal politics is concerned, I don't think that the Democratically controlled congress will go too far left to the point of alienating the moderate swing voters. Of course, most of its actions will anger those on the Religious RIght, but those are lost votes anyway. Social issues will be supported - including abortion rights, stem cell research, gun control (though I highly doubt that it will go as far as total ban on guns). Gay marriage will not be pushed forward (except for fringe groups and lesser politicians), but civil unions might be supported. Liberal Supreme Court justices will retire, to be replaced by justices that seem fairly left-of-center. As for political rhethoric and partisanship, I'm not sure. Initial signs are good and, if the moderate part of the Republican party ends up winning the current identity war, the fairly peaceful near-term relationship could continue. However, if the far right wing wins the Republican identity war, then partisanship will recover full blast and we will see a lot of filibustering and exagerated rhetoric...\n \n On terrorism, the extremists are currently in a wait-and-see mode since most people in the Middle East are positive about Obama and they cannot make a strong case against him until they have something specific to criticize. They may get this in his stance on Afghanistan, continued rhetoric about Iran's nuclear weapon's program, and his general support for Israel - i.e. they will exagerate this out of all proportion. Then, it depends on how most of the Middle East reacts. Certainly, Obama's stance is more moderate than Bush's. Will this, along with his heritage, convince those in the Middle East that we are no longer the \"great Satan\" or will the extremists be able to convince them otherwise? I don't know. Either way, relations will improve compared to the Bush administration. \n \n On energy, I think we will continue to be very dependent on foreign oil by the time he leaves office (2012 or 2016). I think he will make some efforts at funding alternative fuels and might push for natural gas, ethonol, hybrids, and other similar nearer term technologies. However, it will still be a couple of decades before we see alternative non-fossil fuels make significant (tens of percent) entrance into our energy consumption.",

Some of us, including myself, see financial ruin in our future, especially if we abandon core capitalism in favor of soft socialistic policy.\n\n Thank you for clearing that up - I did misunderstand.\n \n I'll grant you that it is easier to make grand statements of benevolence of society for the poor if one is not paying for that benevolence. Nevertheless, views of society's responsibility toward helping those less fortunate through government help are not only coming from retired people, they represent significant numbers - often majorities - of the US population. My salary would probably be classified under upper-middle class and, though I would not be affected by the Obama tax raise since my salary is still significantly under $250k, I would still be willing to pay a couple of extra percent of taxes if it really meant that we could have a sound safety net for everyone. This view is partly out of a feeling of responsibility toward those who are worse off, but it is also partly out of selfish desire to know that that safety net is there if I ever need one. Our economy is not perfectly sound where many industries have massive layoffs, and one is always a mere car accident away from being helplessly incapacitated and needing long term support. I, along with many others, simply think that it makes for a safer and better society if there is a stronger sense of community responsibility and care than if we are more in a dog-eat-dog world.\n \n I realize that many of our differences may mainly be in the degree to which this is practiced. For example, most Republicans I know (mostly moderates) are supportive of some sort of Social Security and Medicare - few would get rid of them outright. Most agree that it is right for the state to support the incapacitated. I think both Republicans and Democrats are hesitant in funding comfortable long term support for those who are neither incapacitated nor responsibly working or looking for work. However, I often get the impression that Republicans overestimate how many poor people are irresponsible while Democrats might underestimate that number. I suspect that the truth lies somewhere in between. However, even where the irresponsible poor are concerns, I personally still feel a sense of responsibility in giving them a minimal safety net - homeless shelters and food banks plus coverage under an Obama type subsidized health care program (note: since most of us would keep our current health care, I do not call his program socialist).",

Due to monumental stupidity at all levels of society, what we so foolishly called \"capitalism\" has vanished ---- never to return. We are now in uncharted territory: as I predicted so many years ago, the end of America as we have known it has come in a financial collapse, similar to the end of the ancien r\u00e9gime in France. Pray to whatever Powers That Be that we can manage to find our way through the labyrinth which confronts us better than the French of the 18th century.\n \n Money is Power. The traditional controllers of money have almost instantaneously gone from being the dictators of government policy to suppliants begging for handouts from government. The govenment is, or soon will be, the ultimate arbiter of how capital shall flow through the body of society, and President Obama, whether he wishes it or not, will have paramount power over that flow. In essence, he will be the dictator of America.\n \n Now, unlike most people, I do not feel a Pavlovian shudder of horror at the mention of the word \"dictator.\" Dictatorial power is desirable and necessary in moments of emergency. One of the positive features of the Roman Republic was the office of Dictator, lasting no longer than six months. (The Roman Republic was doomed once they permitted the office to last a longer time, and then become perpetual)\n \n Franklin Roosevelt had many of the powers of a dictator, those powers were certainly necessary, and yet the United States did not reel and collapse into a state of irremediable, catastrophic horror because of them.\n \n Obama will be the source of all largess; he will be our dictator. In many ways, the future of the United States will be in his hands, and perhaps even its ultimate destiny. Whether his power will be positive or negative will in large part depend on how the people of America, high and low, react to that power: whether they will be prudent, intelligent and public spirited. I am not sanguine, but neither am I despairing.\n \n Obama will be surrounded by a storm of expectations; he will be like the captain of a sailing ship. For himself and the ship to survive, he must know these winds, know how to steer, when to raise and lower sails, how to tack, and how to handle the crew. \n \n Above all, the fate of the ship, and of all of us, depends on the destination to which we are headed.\n \n -",

In a recent commerical, they showed Obama meeting Latino American leaders in the same set of video clips as 9/11 footage and Obama bowing to the Saudi King, like meeting Latino Americans was on such a deplorable level as 9/11. The Latino vote is big in this country and the GOP base is so hardcore anti-immigration reform that they will continue to lose the Latino vote, and thus will have a very hard time of winning elections. \n \n \n\n May 3rd, 2007. Republican debate. 10 candidates on stage. McCain asked: \"Do you believe in evolution\"? McCain anwers \"yes\". Follow up question to all candidates: \"is there anyone who does not believe in evolution\"? 3 out of ten indicate that they do not. Meaning, that 7 out of 10, including the eventual republican nominee for president, do believe in evolution. \n\n \n That's a good example. I'm glad you calmed down and were able to present one. \n \n \n\n As for immigration, scroll about halfway down the page to the section in big, bolded letters titled: WHERE THE CANDIDATES STAND\n PolitiFact | FACT SHEET: Immigration\n You are likely to see a wide variety of answers, from both parties. This is just a smattering of politicians. You can feel free to look them all up if you really want to, but this small group shows plenty of diversity to me. \n \n\n \n I addressed this above. Also, here's one story that describes how part of the GOP base feels about illegal immigration. link A conservative radio talk show host described Latinos as \"primitive\" and a lot of other racist insults. Generally, the GOP moderates you listed moved their position to the right on illegal immigration. Latino support for the GOP dropped from 45% to 33% from 2004 to 2008. \n \n \n\n I think I am done correcting all of your mischaracterizations for now. Please feel free to provide me with more.\n\n \n Well you think I've made mischaracterizations, but I haven't. I hope the facts I listed helped to mitigate your ignorance of the state of the GOP. Maybe someday you'll be able to accepts facts without your feelings getting hurt too much.",

   "\"Let some Republicans be friends with Latinos and others fear illegal immigration\" does not mean \"Republicans don't have latino friends\". There was recently a meeting of Republicans in a mall. Protesters assembled outside. They were Republicans protesting against illegal immigration.\n\n Here lies the problem. You seem to think that if someone speaks out against illegal immigration, it is because they don't like all those brown people pouring over the border. That's your problem, not mine. Just what is wrong with protesting illegal immigration? Does protesting illegal immigration mean that you don't support the right of latinos or others to become citizens? \n \n \n \nActually, you've contradicted yourself. You say \"not all\" democrats are stereotype 1, 2, 3, 4, etc, implying that some are. Yet you say that my acknowledging that a large part of the GOP base are \"racist rednecks\" is using stereotypes. So what are you trying to prove, other than your lack of integrity and denial of unpleasant truths, by using \"stereotypes\" that you like, but getting upset when the attitudes of some of the constituents of the GOP are discussed?\n\n Actually, no I didn't. I don't deny that there are racist rednecks in the republican party. I don't deny that there are racist rednecks in the democratic party either. I have no problem calling a racist a racist. What I do have a problem with is when people think along the lines of \"if the republican party has some people who believe X, then the majority of them must believe X as well\". That is sterotyping. Applying a label unfairly based on association with a particular group. This is what you are doing when you say that a large part of the GOP are \"racist renecks\". \n \n \nI might take your opinion more seriously, if your comments reflected that you did more than just cheerlead for the GOP from your parent's basement. \n\n Reagan was in office when I moved out of my parents house. \n \n \n \nYou sound pretty angry. The \"reading comprehension\" jab is the most common insult on this forum. You can't get a more original insult out of your brain cell?\n\n Perhaps because it is a very common problem around here. I don't find throwing insults at people in a debate as an effective way of conveying my point. However, if I happen to state my opinion, ie. someone exhibits poor skills of reading comprehension, it is because I believe it to be true.

   "So we're basically right back where we started. I said that \"racist rednecks\" are a large component of the GOP base and snakespit disagrees but is unable to give any rational or fact-based explanation why.\n\n \n Hi RG, although snakespit and I don't often agree on much, I must point out a few historical facts in order to offer some balance in this discussion. As for republicans being the party which speaks the loudest against illegal immigration, I agree, but I wonder why you attribute this to racism rather than a law and order, economic and a national security issue? \n \n Also have you forgotten that it was the democratic party/southern democrats who fought an American civil war in order to preserve legalized slavery in this Country? They gave reasons of economic benefits resulting from the free labor and basic white superiority which justified enslaving another race of people.\n \n More recently, have you forgotten that it was still the democratic party which fought the hardest against the 1964 Civil Rights Bill? And the republican party which fought the hardest for it? Check it out, the dems fought black equality tooth and nail throughout their struggle for equal rights. And the civil rights bill which was finally passed by LBJ under national political pressure was weaker than the Bill which the republicans had written and supported and which was in Congress awaiting passage for years. Because the dems had the majority, they forced through LBJs watered down bill when pressured by national public outcries. \n \n Even more recently, did you miss all of the racist political attacks the democratic party ran against Albert Gonzales, Bush's choice for Attorney General, and Clarence Thomas as an uncle tom because he is a conservative thinker? These men and others have become poster boys for the Left as laughing stocks for political excoriation even though they accomplished great things for their races and have been openly accepted and promoted for their talents through the Republican Party.\n \n Here: Ku Klux Klan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia read up about the historical political roots of the KKK before placing such a blanket label on republicans as racist rednecks. I would never say that some race haters aren't republicans, but it just isn't fair to say it so matter of factly about the whole party when it is in fact the democratic party which has the long standing history and culture of white superiority within its ranks. So let's not make blanket statements in this day and age of political and ethnic diversity. It just isn't fair to place such labels across the board anymore.",

Let's give them a chance and support their efforts to boost the economy. President Obama is doing good work.\n\n \n What I find scary is that you claim to be a professor. I expect more intelligence and objective insight from an educated person who is allegedly more interested in preserving her country and her way of life than supporting a political novice and a socialist self aggrandizing blowhard. Here prof, read it and weep, it's how the other side feels about our imminent demise as an economic superpower under this fraud.\n 100 Days of The Obama April 29 2009\n FILED UNDER POLITICS BY MICHAELZELLNER\n \n Sparta had their 300. The USA has its 1. President Obama reaches this HISTORIC milestone of 100 days in office. NBC, CNN, MSNBC, and CBS have all proclaimed his first 100 more meaning full than any other president EVER.\n \n Where ever you are right now.. Stand up and pay tribute for the great and powerful Obama. Who else but he could spend more money in 100 Days than that horrible spending machine G. W Bush did in 8 years. In fact I would wager he has spent or promised to spend more money in 100 days than the last two presidents in the last 16 years! What a prize piece for the mantle of history he has given us. When my great great great great grandchildren are done paying for all of this spending, they will have the satisfaction of knowing that it did absolutely nothing other than put us farther in debt and of course spread socialism to every corner of the United States.\n \n And lets not forget the Obama World Boot Licking tour! The US HAS to be safer now that the Obama has gone all over the world and apologized for everything wrong with the world in the last 400 years, and now that the Obama is President, we will get America on the straight and narrow, and make America a good country for once in history.\n \n Now to the real world.\n \n The Obama administration is good at 2 things. Misdirection and misleading. That is what they have accomplished in 100 days. They HAVE spent more money than is humanely possible for us to pay for in 50 years. We were told it must be done now and fast, we have no time to wait, or our world will collapse. But what has really been accomplished, other than the US Government basically OWNING private banks, and auto companies. What started as a really bad idea under the Bush administration TARP is flourishing under The Obama and have grow to TARP-2, and has been horribly mismanaged.\n \n The Obama boot licking was a disgrace to the US. Going to Europe and describing the US as arrogant and excessive is reprehensible but not unexpected. Look at The Obama's history and who his associations are. We should expect nothing less from him. It was obvious to most of the intelligent people in the US that he and his wife hate (\"first time in my life I am proud of my country\"). America telling Mexico that 80% of the guns in the Mexican Drug wars, come from the US is a fabrication. The number is more like 17%, and yes I think that is too many. But the source for that 17% will surprise you NBC, CBS and CNN viewers. THE US GOVERNMENT sent most of that 17% to Mexico's Military to help fight the drug trade, and the majority of those guns are now in the drug lords hands! Given to them by the Mexican Military who will sell their first born for a bit of change in their pockets. Now it is easier to get INTO the US than it is to get INTO MEXICO. Reverse border security compliments of The Obama.\n \n Some more misdirection by The Obama, releasing some of the memo's regarding torture, his promise of transparency. The problem is, even in the memo's released it says waterboarding did yield results. I am not in favor of releasing ANY of these memo's because the adverse effect FAR out weight the benefit. That is unless your looking for political capitol. But now that 1/2 the story is out there, in the sprit of transparency, release them all, show what real attacks on the US have been prevented.\n \n About this promise of transparency, the only thing The Obama has been transparent about is what the PRIOR administration has done, to attempt to further demonize republicans. This administration has failed to give us the transparency he promised in regards to their own activities. For example, where was the transparency when this administration authorized a low flyover by one of the presidential jets for a photo op over the statue of liberty? Yes it seems everyone knew in The Obama's administration, The FAA, the Pentagon, of course The Obama denies knowing, but he is the president and is responsible for everything, at least that is what the cries were when Bush was president. THOUSANDS of frightened people scattered out of buildings thinking yet another 9/11 style attack was hitting NY City.\n \n But fear seems to be the order of the day for The Obama. How many times have you heard, THIS IS A CRISIS, WE MUST ACT SWIFTLY WITH OUT DELAY. Only to hurry through a new spending bill with out anyone really taking a look at it. So much for the 5 days for Americans to view any spending bill before it is passed. Fear mongering is what pushed us further into economic trouble by eroding any consumer confidence that was left. We had to act quickly to bail out banks so they can open up credit to consumers and business. So they did and now 100 days later, we are still not seeing results.\n \n The only thing really accomplished in the first 100 days, is the Government has become more powerful, liberties are being eroded, and spending is even more out of control than when Bush was in office. (I didn't think that was possible). The country has taking 100 huge steps towards socialism something I never thought I would see to this extent. Even European countries say that the US is becoming too Socialist too quickly.\n \n Now is that something to be proud of?100 Days of The Obama | PAWaterCooler.com\n \n I challenge you to respond to the documented facts relating to his first 100 days point by point in defense of your messiah.",

Bush's spending made the economy WORSE. Why would Obama's increase in spending make anything better?\n\n \n As I said earlier, World War II ended the Great Depression. WWII ended the depression because of massive government spending. In 1940, government spending amounted to 9.34% of U.S. gross domestic product. By 1943, government spending had soared to 46.6% of U.S. gross domestic product. By 1945, military spending represented 89% of all federal spending. The reason government spending under the New Deal did not end the Great Depression was because there wasn't enough of it.\n \n War production made the U.S. government the chief consumer of goods produced. The U.S. did indeed supply significant amounts of arms to other nations, but much of this weaponry other nations did not pay for, or they paid for it at sharply discounted rates over a long period of time. Britain. the Soviet Union, France, and China were supplied with arms essentially for free through Lend-Lease, which was paid for by the United States government. And before Lend-Lease, of course, there was the cash and carry law, which severely limited arms sales to belligerant powers. \n \n It was direct government spending that jump started the economy during World War II. The government spent money to fund the war, which created jobs, at the same time that the draft and the needs of the war created a labor shortage. The government thus became the nation's biggest consumer. It was the inability of individuals, either at home or abroad, to consume the goods produced by industry that kept the nation in depression. The New Deal spending programs were a step in the right direction, and each time the government spent more, the economy went up. When the government reduced spending and tried to balance the budget, the economy went down, notably in the Roosevelt recession of 1937. But overall government spending during the New Deal did not come close to the spending during the war. \n \n WWII showed that Keynes was right, that government spending would pull an economy out of depression. The key, though, to the economy not sinking back into a depression was the re-conversion to a peacetime economy. The U.S. avoided a return to depression partly through the continuation of military spending, with the choice not to demobilize completely and to keep U.S troops stationed around the world. The U.S. economy was also bolstered after the war by the high wages that were then being paid to newly unionized industrial workers, and by the American decision to rebuild the economies of trading partners abroad through the Marshall Plan and other efforts. Despite a brief economic downturn after the war, these factors enabled the economy to be prosperous and to grow in the post-WWII period. \n \n So, in sum, my argument to you is that it was indeed massive government spending on the war that pulled the U.S. economy out of the depression. \n \n As for the government spending during the Bush 43 years, this spending probably did help to keep the economy pumping along. But as we know from our studies of economics, capitalist economies tend to sink into recession or depression; the business cycle has not gone away. We see that now, again. \n \n Keynes, for all his oddities, was correct in his analysis of the role of government spending in softening the business cycle. But Keynes argued for counter-cyclical government deficit spending, not for government deficit spending during times of boom. Keynes never argued that government could spend all the time and never pay for anything. The Bush 43 fallacy was that the government could engage in massive deficit spending on a war while simultaneously cutting taxes and managing, somehow, to come out even. We will have to pay for our deficit spending. That is most certainly true.",

The next year when government spending is really low the economy shoots up more from year to year than anytime since the US got into WWII (increasing government spending). You realize government spending hasn't gone down (in GDP terms) since 1954? So in the US the funding has never stopped. Furthermore, our deficit has not gone down.

One was government spending which no one doubts causes the economy to grow. The doubt comes in where you think it triggers other growth when the spending stops. The second event in WWII was that the supply of goods did not exist for consumers. So if we were to believe Keynes than an increase in income would prove helpful. If I recall correctly income between 1947 and 1949 did increase by a large amount. BUT it increased more around 1939-1941 (and the period around there).

Since I don't have a crystal ball, and since we historians don't usually make predictions, I am not predicting anything necessarily. All I am saying is give Keynes a chance! ;) \n We can't afford to give him a chance. I literally mean can't afford because we already have a huge deficit. Furthermore, I suggest that WWII was not an example of Keynes working and more to the point those circumstances don't remotely exist today so the comparison would always be off. \n \n \nI would never flame you for presenting your analysis. I might disagree with you, but I would never flame you for it. \n \nI didn't mean you...

But in order for consumption to go up, people had to have money, and the money they earned came from the government spending during the war.\n People had money already and judging from the reports I read (see census website) there is no difference in income from those in the war than out of the war unless it was a second income. Furthermore, wages increased prior to the war and yet demand did not exist. Let me give an example. If the economy has 10 people all of which own a house with 15 homes already existing and the economy is down so you give them $100,000 each will the demand for houses go up? The answer is probably not unless someone is already looking for a second house (which I implied they weren't). While this isn't exactly accurate the point is the same in that giving people money doesn't stimulate the economy.\n \n \nThe government spent money, making itself the chief consumer. This cranked up industry with government demand, led to the employment of lots of people, and put money in their pockets which they could then use for subsequent consumption after the war.\nBut if more money in their pockets (which is debatable considering the tax rates) creates demand than it should have worked out long before WWII. What I am saying is the increase in income is no different than in the mid-late 30s and yet our economy tanked then.",
