   "Ladies and Gentlemen, the question is WHY DOES IT MATTER \"HOW\" SOME ONE \"BECOMES\" GAY (or homosexual, too hard to keep spelling). if you want to argue nature/nurture/learned behavior, go start your own thread.\n\n \n To those of us who are homosexual, it doesn't matter. Neither does it matter to us how someone \"becomes\" hetrosexual. I would venture to say that it doesn't matter to hetrosexuals either, other than as just a curiousity. I believe a growing segment of hetrosexual society have realized that homosexuality is not a threat to them, their lifestyle, or their lives, and therefore it doesn't matter to them either.\n \n I also believe, and have seen here and many other places in society, a vehement minority of hetrosexuals (mostly males) that don't really care what makes a person gay; they the strongly diskike; if not outright hate, homosexuals. Homosexuals make them feel uncomfortable; ill at ease. Why?\n \n They themselves can find no logical basis for their reaction. As such, in many cases, they seek refuge in ways that allow them to avoid logic. The most convienent refuge for them is in religion. Here, they believe they can justify their feelings on the basis theological dogma. \n \n Please do not misunderstand me. I am not against any religion. The roots and basis of all major religions are good. However, throught the ages, man has interupted, corrupted, and twisted their meanings to suit their own ends. As a result, religious belief has been used as a mantle for the most unspeakable crimes every committed; torture, murder, rape, genocide.And yet when confronted with their totally illogical feelings and actions, they hide behind their totally illogical manipulation of the true basis of religion and simply refuse to accpet reality. It is simply impossible to logically get through to someone who refuses to accept logic and defends themselves with illogic. How many examples of this have you seen here?\n \n What causes this? I believe it to be fear; fear of the unknown. Fear of loss of control. Fear of admiting they have been wrong. When you try to confront these people with a reality they cannot accept, they react as most terrified people do who are terrified of anything; they either withdraw completely within themselves or they lash out at that which they so fear. The depth of their reaction is porportional to the depth of their fear. Yet they continue to hide behind the illogical and even deny they are afraid. They again resort to illogical arguments to justify their feelings.\n \n In a thread I started in the \"Gay Rights\" forum called \"Hetrosexuals \"experts\" on Homosexuality\", I challenged these people to come forward and logically explain how they came to know so much about homosexuality. Not surprisingly, not a single one, at this time, has.\n \n So how do we deal with these people? I honestly don't know. Confronting them either logically or illogically doesn't seem to work. They seem to merely view such confrontations as further justification for their feelings and revert further into their illogical shell. I believe if we really knew these people well enough, we would find that homosexuality is not the only thing that they react this way to, but also anything else that they feel threatened by.\n \n I believe the only way to overcome this blight to humanity is by educating people against prejudice, hate, and bigotry in ALL it's forms. For many of these people, it is simply impossible. It is too late to overcome a lifetime of predujice, fear, and hatred that they have learned. This in NO WAY means converting ANY person to homosexuality; man, woman, nor especially child. It means understanding and accepting that each individual is different from any other individual, and accepting that so long as the other individual does you no harm, they have the right to be who they are.\n \n In a way, I feel pity for these people; to have to live their lives with such fear and hatred. But I honestly believe that for many of them, they cannot change or be changed.",

Homosexuals make them feel uncomfortable; ill at ease. Why?\n \n\n \n Well here is a perspective on this issue- sexual insecurity. Many men (and here I mean heterosexuals) are extremely vunerable regarding sexual approach- as a rule men want to be the initators (ie. in control) of a potentially sexual encounter/relationship. There are alot of guys who find it difficult to deal with sexually foward women, or even a woman being sexually forward for that matter.\n \n I suppose all men subconciously know they are sexually forward..... so I guess alot of hetro men are deeply afraid of being sexually approched by a gay man. I think most men have an ignorance regarding what is sexually attractive to a gay man and there is a real feeling of being completely out of control in a situation where the guy is normally boss and wants to be in control.\n \n I don't know..... maybe the aggression and violence is a mantifestation of this insecurity. There are more things at play, but I think this is quite fundemental.",

   "I believe the real question is between being and acting. There are those who simply are and those who actively make a concisious decission to act as if they are of a different sexuality than that of which they were born. \n \n There are those who act of another race, but it cannot change the fact of which race they were actually born. That much is obvious. They same holds true for eye color and hair color. A person can purchase costmetic enhancements which fool the onlooker, but the naturally occuring colors of these things cannot be changed perminantly or at the root level. \n I personally believe the same is true for sexuality. \n From my own experience I made a concious decission to act straight, although it could never change the fact of who I really am. My personal road of acceptance of my own truth was something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I know that my road was and is a road traveled often by many other gays and lesbians. \n \n Society is the one which is hardwired. It's so much the norm to assume everyone is born straight that anything else disturbs personal ballance. \n This is very similar to what Ocam was saying with the idea of hardwired acceptance of male sexual dominance. \n Anything that veers from what is thought of to be the \"norm\" upsets some in such a way that violence is their only resort. \n \n Sad to say, but true.",

   "From:http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_fixe.htm (religious tolerance seems to be a rare commidity among the religious)\n \n \n \"A number of techniques have been used to try to suppress homosexual feelings and/or create heterosexual feelings in gays and lesbians: \n -Lesbians had their breasts amputated.\n -Lesbians had their perfectly healthy uteri removed.\n -Male gays were given aversion therapy; e.g. clients were shown pictures of naked men and simultaneously shocked with electricity.\n \n Other \"treatments\" included:\n -brain surgery in the form of frontal lobotomies.\n -castration.\n -counseling and psychotherapy.\n -drug therapy: e.g. animal-organ extracts, cocaine, estrogen, testosterone.\n -positive therapy: e.g. men were asked to masturbate and then were shown pictures of women just before orgasm.\n -prayer and spiritual counseling.\n -therapy by tedium: men were shown homoerotic pictures until they became totally bored.\n -During the Nazi regime in Germany, Himmler attempted to \"cure\" gays by requiring them to visit the camp brothel at Flossenburg. \"Ten Ravensbruck women provided the services with little success. The women [were later]...shipped to Auschwitz\" for execution.\n -During the recent apartheid regime in South Africa, gays and lesbians were considered deviants. They were sent to a special ward of a military hospital to be \"rehabilitated.\" This involved electric shock treatments and chemical castration. Those who could not be \"cured\" were given sex-change operations. A number of \"patients\" died.\n \n The success rate of these therapies in actually changing clients' sexual orientation appears to have been between 0% and something less than 0.1%. The success rate at changing clients' sexual behavior is much greater. Some of these techniques can persuade homosexuals to be celibate, either through terror, guilt, or persuasion that God considers same-sex behavior to be an abomination. They can persuade bisexuals to confine their sexual activities to members of the opposite sex. They may even be able to train gays to successfully have sex with a woman, while fantasize about making love to another man. But therapies do not seem to be capable of changing one's feelings -- one's sexual orientation -- in the vast majority of people. 4\n \n \n References:\n 1.
