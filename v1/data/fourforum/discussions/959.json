   "Animated Evolution and Un-natural Selection\n \n Richard Dawkins, well known amongst evolutionaries suggested using computer modelling to show how relatively easily mutations can leap from one creature to another. He is very keen to get people interested in these as they are simple to run and suggest much change over little time...\n \n \"Dawkins started from a conventional recursive algorithm : for each iteration, a new connection is generated. The aim was to generate tree forms. Starting from a trunk, to any new iteration corresponds a sub-branch. The use of biomorph quickly showed the algorithm was absolutely not limited to the realization of different trees (apple trees, fir trees ...) ; but could also generate many types of forms, biological or not. Dawkins was therefore quite surprised to discover an insect-looking biomorph followed by planes, bats, branched candlesticks?\" \n http://www.rennard.org/alife/english/biomintrgb.html#rTit2 \n \n The funniest thing is... sorry, I'm going to have to write it again! \n \"Dawkins was therefore quite surprised to discover an insect-looking biomorph followed by planes, bats, branched candlesticks?\" \n So, this magical program that is supposed to represent life actually can also produce aeroplanes! I'd like to see DNA morph into such things!\n \n The next bit is just as funny... \n \"The use of biomorph is very simple. The eye of the user plays the role of natural selection. Starting from a given form, the user will systematically select the biomorph whose resemblance -very subtle at the beginning - is closer to the wanted form. After a certain number of generations, the result will draw near to the aim.\" (Ibid)\n \n So, in other words, you an intelligent actor weed out the programs that don't look like anything that resembles a living thing. Then you keep building up on the programs that look most like life. You are the creator of this cyber-universe! So much for 'natural' selection!\n \n Here's what Richard Milton says about computer modelling....granted this is referring to whole creatures like Dawkins did...but hopefully you'll get the point... \n \"In his book \"The Blind Watchmaker\" Richard Dawkins describes a computer program he wrote which randomly generates symmetrical figures from dots and lines. These figures, to a human eye, have a resemblance to a variety of objects. Dawkins gives some of them insect and animal names...Dawkins calls these creations 'biomorphs' meaning life shapes or living shapes...He also refers to them as \"quasi-biological' forms and in a moment of excitement calls them 'exquisite creatures'. He plainly believes that in some way they correspond to the real word of living animals \n (Dawkins says of his biomorphs) \"With a wild surmise, I began to breed generation after generation... my incredulity grew in parallel with the evolving resemblance... Admittedly they have like a spider...\" (However) The only thing about the biomorphs that is biological is Richard Dawkins, their creator. The program Dawkins wrote and the computer he used have no analog at all in the real biological world...his program is not a true representation of random mutation coupled with natural selection. On the contrary it is dependent on artificial selections (conducted by Dawkins) in which he controls the rate of occurrence. There is also no failure in his program: his biomorphs are not subject to fatal consequences of degenerate mutations like real living things. And most important of all, he chooses which are the luck individuals to receive the next mutation.\" quoted from \"Shattering the Myths of Darwinism\" pp168-9. \n emoticon_xgood \n \n Anyway, if you want to make your own biomorphs, go to \n http://www.rennard.org/alife/english/biomintrgb.html#rTit2 \n (Which says \"The third chapter of the blind watchmaker is dedicated to the biomorph program developed by Dawkins that points out the power of micro-mutations and cumulative selection.\" \n All it means is that micro-mutations of a computer program, and cumulative selection by the programmer!)\n \n You evolutionaries out there really crack me up!

   "ugg... this really bothers me. I'm surprised this doesn't have any responses yet... i hope no one read this post and believed the conclusions montalban drew. \n \n it's important to take quotes and ideas in context when you critique them. the closest montalban comes to the ideas dawkin's was trying to get across was when he said:\n \n \nRichard Dawkins, well known amongst evolutionaries suggested using computer modelling to show how  relatively  easily mutations can leap from one creature to another. He is very keen to get people interested in these as they are simple to run and suggest much change over little time...\n\n (emphasis mine)\n \n dwakins never proposed that these biomorphs were completely analogous to real life organisms. The purpose of the chapter on biomorphs was to show how improbable it is to arrive at a beneficial mutation if the mutation is large, and how much more probable (relatively speaking) it is when small mutations occur.\n \n \"What is all this telling us about real evolution? Once again, it is ramming home the importance of gradual, step-by-step change\" (p. 72)\n \n \"If the mutational jump we are considering is a very large one, the number of possible destinations of that jump is astronomically large.\" (p. 73)\n \n \"If an animal is a parent, it must be good enough to survive at least to adulthood. It is possible that a mutant child of that parent might be even better at surviving. But if a child mutates in a big way, so that it has moved a long distance away from it's parent in genetic space, what are the odds of it's being better than it's parent?\" (p. 72-72)\n \n \"Even a small random jump in genetic space is pretty likely to end in death. But the smaller the jump the less likely death is, and the more likely is it that the jump will result in improvements.\" (p.73)\n \n right after making this main point dawkins says \"That is as far as i want to go in drawing morals from Biomorph Land.\"(p. 73)\n \n \nSo, this magical program that is supposed to represent life actually can also produce aeroplanes! I'd like to see DNA morph into such things!\n\n \n NO! the only way this program was supposed to represent actual life was that there were a HUGE number of possible creatures, and any small mutational change is much more likely to produce a beneficial result than a large mutational change. \n \n \nSo, in other words, you an intelligent actor weed out the programs that don't look like anything that resembles a living thing. Then you keep building up on the programs that look most like life. You are the creator of this cyber-universe! So much for 'natural' selection!\n\n \n well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small. \n \n analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false. \n \n montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas.",

Its functioning - even restrained to a basic description - supposes a perfect organization between various complex components :\n The iris - equivalent to the diaphragm of your camera - regulates the quantity of light received. The lens (biconvex) adjusts the focal distance. The retina - which is the film - contains about 125 millions of photosensitive cells (compare that value to your digital camera resolution).

The malfunction of one of the components implies imperfect sight, either an unidentifiable image or no image at all. \n In this context, it is hard to explain the apparition of the eye on an evolutionist point of view. Since the system only works when achieved, and since the evolution always proceeds through micro-mutations2, how to imagine a complete chain conferring a strictly increasing evolutive advantage, starting from no sight at all and leading to the modern eye ?\"\n \n Biomorphs are an embarrassing attempt to explain just how a complex structure such as an eye might come about by gradual mutations, except they only do this by fooling you into believing the program mimics a natural possibility - when it can't, not when you are running the program and interfering at will.",

Dawkins may not have designed some of these, but he promotes them.\n \n \nhopefully anyone doing serious research will not stop at insinuated meanings from advertising banners. \n\n \n Again this implies something it's not. They're not aimed at serious research. Dawkins wrote a very readable book specifically to get the general public involved. Most of these web-sites are offering biomorph programs to schools or other interested parties. It is a sales and marketing exercise to sell atheistic materialism to the wider public.\n \n \ni still hold that you have misrepresented the biomorphs model, and are still trying to imply that biomorphs are a bad model of evolution. biomorphs are not meant to be a model in the ways you are implying. you should also retract your original statement, and acknowledge that the biomorphs model is only relevant in regards to small mutations vs. large mutations.\n\n \n I've no idea why you write this. Biomorphs are used to show how small mutations can lead to big changes. From a small point to a line, to a number of lines to an 'insect'.

This website is an online implementation of the genetic algorithms he describes in The Blind Watchmaker, intended for use as a instructional tool for explaining evolutionary concepts and Genetic Algorithms. \n The biomorphs have a simple two-dimensional branching morphology (phenotype) controlled by a series of 'genes' (genotype), or rules. These rules are can be evolved over time by playing the role of 'the reaper', selecting which geneotype survives. To evolve your own online biomorph, you start with a basic branching morphology as a parent, and a set of 8 children, each child is a slightly different mutation genetically from the parent.

But site after site promotes the use of biomporhs to prove an aspect of evolution, and they don't. BECAUSE All a biomorph shows is that a computer program can change a picture into another picture.

   "This makes no sense. You say that they prove small step mutations over large step mutations. To what end? What's that mean?\n\n \n it's explained in \"the blind watchmaker\", but briefly: The number of possible results from a large step mutation are obscenely large, while the number of results from a small step mutation is relatively small. \"genetic space\" (all possible animals possible through manipulating genes) is huge. a random jump from one place in genetic space to another is very likely going to be a harmful mutation. On the other hand, a single step from an already functioning organism (the adult) is more likely to produce a beneficial mutation (granted not guaranteed, but still possible). \n \n with the 9 variable genes, and 15 or so discreet states for each gene, there are literally trillions of potential biomorphs. pretend their is a successive chain, or tree of biomorphs from a very simple one to a very complex one. this tree represents a series of biomorphs that are alive, and differ by one gene when compared to other biomorphs adjacent to them. a random mutation at any of those links is much more likely to land on another link if the mutation is small. if the mutation is large the chances of landing somewhere on the chain is exceedingly small. \n \n \nThe problem being is that I'd have to link every specific biomorph page to Dawkins himself, or you'll say \"Dawkins doesn't believe this particular claim...\"\n\n \n OF COURSE you would need to link it to dawkins himself. how else would you know that he believed a given claim?\n \n \nIf I show site after site after site that claims biomorphs prove a facit of evolution, which you agree that they do, then all I had to do is show that they are bad models, and I have.\n\n \n how are they bad models in regards to showing small step mutation is more likely to occur than large step mutation? showing that biomorphs is a bad model for things like natural selection and cumulative mutation is worthless because biomorphs never make this argument. To critique ANY computer model you must first show what part of evolution the model is trying to show, and then how the computer model is in error. \n \n \nYou can well pick on the length of that particular site. But site after site promotes the use of biomporhs to prove an aspect of evolution, and they don't. BECAUSE All a biomorph shows is that a computer program can change a picture into another picture. No more!\n\n \n address small step mutation vs large step mutation. do biomorphs show that the former is required over the latter?",

I don't see how you can attack the concept. it is basically saying a small constrained force that can on cause minor change can cause a major change over time.
