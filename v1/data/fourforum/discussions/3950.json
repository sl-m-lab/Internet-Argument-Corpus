   "Bush's comments about the dollar, especially 'If other countries are worried about the US trade imbalance, they can buy more US products' (is he for real?), seem to have brought a more realistic form of economic reporting from the US print media. This is the first US public article in general circulation I've read outlining and stressing the disasterous potential we face with our spending habits:\n \n http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=544&ncid=703&e=1&u=/ap/20041216/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_economy\n \n How would TV news present that in the few minutes they use between partisan politics and paid programing?",

Lip service it is when the latest administration statements 'promise' halving deficit spending by 2009. They've pumped the GDP up with public debt/spending using fear to justify spending on home defense, Iraq/Afghanistan and conventional military spending increases to where equity markets would take a tremendous hit if those expenditures were reduced. I see more of that in the future to keep momentum going in the squirrel cage. Iran and Syria would be easy targets. And we seem to have forgotten the wild card, Bin Laden. \n \n Other than more public debt, I don't see any other method for them to keep things in place on a short-term basis. They're ignoring the trade imbalance because they know Asia and Japan will attempt keeping us afloat by buying our debt until they can replace our markets with China. The falling dollar they justify by saying it will make US products more attractive as exports, neglecting to mention what will happen to US inflation and interest rates or that we're intensely disliked by the remainder of the world, which is beginning to shun US products with the intensity they're showing the dollar. \n \n It's quite a **** game and we have the house percentage going against us, which will eventually drain us dry as expanding operating expenses and debt service exceed positive cash flow. When is the only question. On a personal basis I would like to see interest rates increase to a reasonable level but that'll be chaotic for the greater part of the country.",

I'd hate to look at an income statement where the bottom line shrunk by 12% over the past year due to exchange rates. We're using our military power to cow the world or our suppliers would have long ago indexed their currency as China does by not allowing it to float as our internal debt kills the dollar.

While we have certainly seen the \"sell them their chrismas presents then snatch up handfulls of dollars in order to drive the dollar up before transforming them to euros, yen, etc...\" game this year, the biggest purchaser of our latest debt offering was our own government. \n \n With N Korea rattling the sabre, and China already more or less comitted to supporting them, lacking foolish action by N Korea, China seems to be backing off when it comes to propping up our economy. It seems that anti-US feelings are pretty high in china right now and the people are not real big on the idea of their government supporting us in our folly.\n \n We are seeing new consumer markets come on line at a fairly massive scale as nations which have traditionally been third tier, starving cesspools (libya for instance) are forging trade agreements with the EU. While there are definate advantages to having one large consumer economy to deal with, there seems to be efforts beign made to consolidate some of the smaller consumer bases to make up for the shortages in the US market. While the US consumer is certainly important to international producers, I don't think that a collapse in the US has the catastrophic implications for other nations that it once did. \n \n Granted it would almost certianly be preferetial to bring China in to replace the US consumer market, I don't think that it is seen as mandatory. It seems like, unlike in the past where other nations really had no choice but to supprot us and our huge consumer base, there are plenty in the world who are more than willing to let us fall on our butts and make a slightly shakier transition to those smaller markets.",

It still comes down to timing, when, and how aggressive we get with our military in desperation to keep the ball in the air. While taking place in dribbles and drabs, I think a big switch from dollars to euros in the oil industry will be the first major indication of other countries deserting the dollar for good.

I routinely order equipment from overseas and it has become increasingly common for my suppliers to request payments in Eurpos or British Pounds. The dollar has always reigned supreme in international trade. Any threat to this supremacy should be raising eyebrows all over America.\n \n With European manufacturers already shunning dollars (and understandably so), I think that a switch within OPEC to the euro is definate possibility. I don't think it is likely to happen int he next 6 months or year, but they cannot afford to stick with a sinking currency. There is simply too much money involved.\n \n 15 years ago such a change would have been unthinkable. Of course, 5 years ago if people has said \"in 5 years the majoruty of the worlds nations will be holding their cash reserves in non dollar currencies\" It hink they would have been the laughing stock of the finacial community. Today that is just the reality of the world we live in. Nobody wants to see their cash reserves decrease by over 10% per year due to a shrinking dollar.",

   "The simple fact is that who can afford to take ongoing bottom line hits from a declining currency and how long can they do it when there are options? Unlike the US and Japan, many developed countries operate very close to revenue with little dependence on debt and watch their reserves in a prudent manner. Even public US corporations will be exposed to stockholder lawsuits should they pursue non-US transactions and involve foreign exchange to use the dollar out of a sense of patriotism, resulting in lost shareholder value.\n \n As our debt increases and the dollar drops, the US consumer will take the brunt of of our fiscal irresponsibility. What they don't realize, as they support our false economy based on senseless, aggressive foreign policy, is that we no longer have not just the economic capability, but increased debt capacity for recovery from even a minor recession. How long the fed can stave off interest rate increases while we continue to accelerate debt will be the point where the consumer will face a whole bunch of reality. As a guess, I'm thinking a 6% fed rate will open the floodgates of crippling much of our domestic service industry, based on credit card balances tied to prime.",

Exxon who have just purchased weren't too happy about this, but they have R&D money to burn because the price per barrel of crude is high at the moment due to the huge demand (ironic in a way).\n \n \n Thing is, as long as other countries/corporations are prepared to lend to the US governement the current fiscal situation will perpetuate- there is no pressure to beat the deficit as there is so much borrowing available which can be used to meet this end.

That is not something a nation usually does except as an act of desperation. \n \n I am not sure how high and dry a decline in US imports would really leave overseas suppliers. Either prices would have to drop, or currency values would have to drop in exprot contries in order to make their offereings appealing to smaller markets. From a prcatical standpoint, in a scenario where America takes a serious economic hit, the Euro could afford to decline 35% overnight wihtout serious damage to the economies of EU nations. \n \n There would certianly be 6 or 8 months of difficulty in these countries, but things would almost certainly end up OK in the end,.",
