   "Hi!\n \n I'm a journalism student from Youngstown State University in Youngstown, Ohio. \n \n I'm doing a story about ex-gay ministries for an Advanced Reporting Class. For my story, I would like to include the experiences of someone who attended one of these therapy sessions. \n \n Living where I do (the middle of nowhere) I was able to come across very, very few people to talk to about this. I was wondering if anyone here may be able to direct me to someone they know (preferably in Ohio or Western PA) who has been to therapy for this. \n \n I'm also on the lookout for any organization of people who may have attended therapy and founded a group through their shared experiences (that may not have made any sense, I'm sorry). Google isn't being helpful with this, this is why I ask.\n \n Feel free to contact me about this, I'll be more than happy to hear from you!\n \n Thanks again,\n \n AIM: BilliamSigTau\n billiamforty@hotmail.com",
