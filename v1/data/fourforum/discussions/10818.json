We saw the fastest expansion of our national debt since WWII. In factm the only time since WWII that our debt has expanded that quickly today is with Bush II.

I am going to quote myself from another thread here to save a little typing:\n \n Taxes on US businesses are not as big a deal as you think they are because the infrastructure tradeoff is IMMENSE. For example, boeing did some renovations at their Wichita facility a while back. In order to facilitate the expansion, $21 million worth of roadwork was done, a $10 million electrical service upgrade was done and a new 24\" water main was run 12 miles. ALL of that was paid for with our tax dollars. \n \n If you open a new factory in india, where taxes are low, the factory owner has to pay for the cost of all those upgrades. Even in most of Europe they would have to pay for AT LEAST the cost of the electrical build out.\n \n Business taxes in the US are basically infrastructure rental costs and businesses pay them HAPPILY because it is one hell of a lot cheaper than the alternative. \n \n Companies move overseas becuase labor is cheaper. They do not move for tax reasons or because of regulations regardless of the BS that some folks like to tell you. Base costs, which include taxes and regulatory expenses, are actually HIGHER in most countries than they are in the US because the government subsidizes so much of the infrastructure here.\n \n \nThe die-hard liberals think the way to get more revenue for the government is to increase taxes...they do it...businesses slow their spending..the economy slows right behind them.

Yet here we are about to vote in a totally liberal slate of XXXXXX who will again send us into a really poor economy.\n\n \n If you could prove that, you would revolutionize economics. The FACT is that we have absolutly no evidence whatsoever that tax rates have any effect at all on business spending. NONE. The laffer curve is THEORETICAL because no capitalist nation on the planet has ever had a high enough tax rate to test it. While I personally agree with the theory, I also agree with MOST economists that the tax rate required to curb business spending is north of 70%. \n \n There is another dynamic that has become an issue lately that many, myself included, failed to consider which may invalidate the laffer curve completely. The laffer curve basically works on the assumption that money not spent on taxation is re-invested for the purpose of expansion and growth. It is increasingly starting to look like that was an bas assumption. Corporate taxes in the US are not particularly high, but companies have reached a point where they have halted expansion because they have overgown the market they can realistically serve. When they reached that point, they started shipping that money offshore, thus taking it out of our economy.

It is insanely unpopular to raise taxes (even if needed) so the chances of this happening is small. People think that getting rid of \"pork spending\" will solve everything but it won't even bring us out of our yearly debt. In fact, we could get rid of every department but the top 4-5 in spending and still run a deficit. \n \n While I agree we aren't being taxed to much and probably at a perfect rate....it is irrelevant to the idea that we aren't in a problem of having too much debt. In this case you have to raise taxes even if you get nothing out of it but lower debt. \n \n If you think about it though, the one big benefit to the \"Fair Tax\" is that you can actually disguise a tax hike to help pay for the debt.

At all. Period. Or looked at the debt by president graphs. \n \n Reagan was a menace to the economy and made the inflation war Volcker was fighting so much harder. If you're in your late 50s, you should have first hand knowledge of just how bad stagflation was. You should also remember how Reagan pouring billions into the economy during high inflation only made the war on inflation bloody hard. Read Alan Greenspan's \"Age of Turbulence\" for a real economist's look on the past couple of Presidents. Reagan was an economic douchebag.\n \n http://zfacts.com/p/318.html\n \n You're going to have a hard time trying to prove that Reagan's policies did not account for the massive spike in debt.",

   "This is a sad truth that once again proves accounting < economics haha (all be it I'm biased). \n\n \n Depends on the economics in question. At its most basic level, economics is mostly just an attempt to understand accouting interactions and fluctuations. \n \n Where economics becomes disreputable is when you get into crackpot economics like Reaganomics or the Bush economic plan where a lot of people who are good at using language that the general public is not going to understand spend a lot of time trying to convince people that 2+2= and infinite amount of wealth...if we cut taxes and spend more money on defense. \n \n We are getting to the point where we basically are reaching the end of the crackpot economics bubble that goes back nearly 50 years and basic.\n \n \nDavid Walker has been saying this for years. It is insanely unpopular to raise taxes (even if needed) so the chances of this happening is small. People think that getting rid of \"pork spending\" will solve everything but it won't even bring us out of our yearly debt. In fact, we could get rid of every department but the top 4-5 in spending and still run a deficit. \n\n \n And cutting most of the top 4 won't do us much good because the financial world has made it pretty clear that downgrades in SS and Medicare WILL be viewed as default on the bonds in those trust funds since the only reason we need to downgrade them is that we cannot afford to pay the bonds. \n \n \nWhile I agree we aren't being taxed to much and probably at a perfect rate....it is irrelevant to the idea that we aren't in a problem of having too much debt. In this case you have to raise taxes even if you get nothing out of it but lower debt. \n\n \n I woudl amost go so far as to say that the upper class could stand to have a little more of their investment income taxed....either that or we need to re-vamp our patent laws to make our economy more productive, which would drive down profit margins because lower priced players would be able to enter the field. \n \n Patent law in the US is insane and leads to virtual monopolies on technologies that never should have been allowed to be patented in the first place. TiVo is a good example. There was DVR technology (hardware and software) available for computers to do what a TiVo box does long before TiVo ever hit the scene. I (being the techo-gadget nut that I am) had a DVR computer for at least a couple of years before they came out with their first box. What they did was take existing technoloigy and put it in a set top box. There was nothing revolutionary there, nothing particularly innovative, but they were allowed to patent the concept. Now you will never see a low priced TiVo type DVR because they require large royalty payments and they pick and choose who is \"allowed\" to build such units.\n \n Complete and utter ####, but it makes for big profits, which makes for big investment income for the top 1% of americans. \n \n \nIf you think about it though, the one big benefit to the \"Fair Tax\" is that you can actually disguise a tax hike to help pay for the debt. While I'm not sold on the Fair Tax, this certainly is one of its better qualities.\n\n \n This is true. On the other hand, we could keep our current tax system AND have a sales tax emoticon_xhoho \n \n I see a few problems with the fair tax. First, the cost is higher than supporters are willing to admit. First of all, they have underestimated administration costs (estimated at up to $800 billion per year). Second, they have based their calculations on what it would take to match current expenditures when we currently have something like a $170 billion deficit. Third, nobody seems to have any plan as to what we are going to do for money at the federal level while we transition to the new system. Finally, I think our current system is pretty fair. Wealthy people pay more in taxes because they are obviously benifitting more from the system than other classes. I don't see anything wrong with that and am a little confused about why the middle class spends so much time worrying about how much rich people pay and coming up with plans to ensure that rich people pay less, and the middle class pays more. Even more confusing is that these are the same folks who are always whining about how taxes are too high in general.\n \n One area I do think needs some work when it comes to our tax system is windfalls. I have known and worked with a lot of comissioned sales people and small businessmen who at some point make that one big once in a lifetime sale and walk away with 300+ thousand dollars in one shot. I think they should be able to keep it free of taxes. Every time I have EVER seen that, it is a SERIOUS incentive for them to expand business or open their own business. I think they should be able to do it without it being a tax nightmare. \n \n To some degree that do that with section 179, but I don't think that is quite enough. Sure, they can write off a lot of their equipment perchases first year, but they are almost certainly going to end up with a capacity surplus, which will leave them cash poor and in a bad position to keep going until business can catch up to capacity. IF lawmakers actually want to help small business, they need to do something about that.",
