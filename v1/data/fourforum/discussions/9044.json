The real presence of Christ in the eucharist is a doctrine that Goes back to the very early Christian, St Paul tells us we should not partake of the eucharist without first discerning the real presence...more reading.....\n\n \n I agree that the idea of transubstantiation goes way, way back--even to the earliest church fathers. Reading their works makes that clear. (and I have read them.) Nevertheless the scriptural basis for it seems to be a literal reading of something that seems clearly representative and allegorical: \"Take, eat, this is my body.\" Jesus had already given that allegory in earlier teaching to crowds, and He DID say \"do this in rembrance of me.\" It just seems odd to assume that He couldn't have meant \"this is my body\" as a spiritual and allegorical statement. Furthermore, I don't see ANY basis there for the need to re-present Christ's sacrifice everytime--He simply said to do it in remembrance of Him. But the issue of whether the elements are representative or literally His body isn't as big a deal to me as other matters, such as the idea of the eucharist needed as a means of atonement every time.\n \n \nThe doctrine of Sola Scriptura is an entirely protestant doctrine. It is a doctrine that infactically denounces doctrines that are extra biblical The doctrine of sola scriptura itself is an extra biblical doctrine.:xbanghead\n\n \n First, sola scriptura isn't a \"doctrine.\" It simply means \"only the scriptures.\" It's a way of viewing the role of the Bible in the Christian life and came about in Reformation because Catholicism had added so much stuff that wasn't there such as the buying and selling of indulgences. In defense of sola scriptura, if doctrines are extra-Biblical, then they aren't Biblical doctrines to begin with, right? Why would you want a Christian doctrine that wasn't Biblically based?\n \n \nYou have a misunderstanding of Catholic belief in the Eucharist. Catholics believe that Christ was sacrificed \"once for all,\" as it tells us in Hebrews. But we believe that God's sacrifice is outside of time and space so it is continual and is simply re-presented at each Mass and applied to those of us in the current age.\n\n \n Like I said, I'm certainly willing to say that I could have been wrong on that. It's based on protestant perceptions of Catholicism, so I was interested to hear you take.\n \n You'll find that unlike a lot of protestants, I have a lot of respect for Catholicism. I think there are certainly elements of it that protestantism could learn from, particularly in the way they worship. But I don't agree with the extra-Biblical doctrines.",

Any doctrines I hold to held by the early church fathers are Biblical as well, IMO. It's often claimed, for example, that the Trinity is extra-Biblical because \"trinity\" is not found anywhere in the Bible. And yet the elements of the Trinity are found all through the Bible. Because of that, anyone is going to be very hard-pressed to convince me that the doctrine of Trinity is not Biblical. \n \n \nIt is further worth remembering that Revelation, the book obsessed about by some protestants, was thought the least reliable of the books included in the Bible, and Martin Luther actually wanted it removed from the Bible. \n\n \n Yes, and he felt the same way about the Book of James, BTW. \n \n \nThe line that the Anglican church takes is that the Bible contains \"all things necessary for salvation\", but that doesn't mean it contains a full understanding of God, or the nature of the afterlife.\n\n \n So have you ever been to an Anglican service where the homily was from the Koran, or the Tibetan book of the Dead? I suspect Anglicans are more sola scriptura in practice than you are indicating. The Bible is the basis of Christianity, because from it we get Christ and the teachings of the apostles. To some extent, Christians have to have be sola scriptura--it's the natural thing. It sounds like you may think of sola scriptura as some sort of putting strict limits on what we understand about God, but that's not really what it's about. It doesn't mean that we can't have, for example, a beautiful poem giving glory to God as a part of worship. Or Anglicans using the Song of the Three in their liturgy. It's not about limiting, but rather returning to the scriptures are the authority about the Christian God. Sola Scriptura was a natural reaction to things like the selling of indulgences, Papal infallibility, or the Pope giving eternal favors for people building cathedrals, which just isn't Biblical in any way whatsoever. We used part of the beautiful work St. Patrick's Breatplate in worship this past Sunday, but we still consider ourselves sola scriptura.\n \n \nIt's interesting to hear your take on both Anglicanism and Catholicism, jyoshu, it does make me wonder whether there are some slightly unscrupulous (or ill-informed?) protestant pastors spreading misinformation out there.\n\n \n Oh I'm sure there are. But I don't base my assumptions on them, and where I'm wrong I'm more than willing to learn and amend my thinking. But let's face it--anyone not being a part of a given tradition is likely to have some misconceptions about it. I grew up Southern Baptist and am very familiar with it's views. (I'm not with them any more.) I find that it's very common that people make assumptions and have misconceptions about them as well. \n \n And frankly, I don't think I'm exactly terribly wrong on Anglicans and Catholics. Whether Christ is \"re-sacrificed\" or \"re-presented\" for atonement every time is somewhat of a \"technical\" misundertanding, IMO. I'm not going in based on what I've heard from \"protestant pastors\", but having done research and spent some time worshipping with them. Frankly, some what INRI says doesn't entirely jibe with what I've read, which tells me that there are differences among Catholics themselves on these issues.",

Remember the entire NT was wrote in Greek.\n \n Jewish Rabbi's held a counil in Jamnia in pallistine circa 100AD in reaction to the Christian Church. These Jewish rabbi's removed seven of the books from the hebrew canon that are found in the Spetuigent 1. Wisdom, 2. Sirach, 3. Judith, 4. Baruch, 5. Tobit 6. First Maccabees and 7. second Maccabees as well as portions of daniel and Esther. The Early Christian community continued to use the septuigent and when the church decided the canon of the bible it was the septuigent that would be the OT canon of the Bible and so it remained for over 1000 years until Luther removed them\n \n The reason given by the Jewish Rabbi's was that they could not find Hebrew counter parts for these books, which in turn was used as justification by Luther too but research into the dead sea scrolls found at Qumran has descoverd ancient hebrew copies of the disputed books making their rejection unsupportable on those Grounds.\n \n Weather or not Luther and the jews were justified it was the septuigent that\n Jesus and the apostles used...but at the end of the day it really comes down to prefereance of which OT canon would you personally would rather use.\n \n \nI agree that the idea of transubstantiation goes way, way back--even to the earliest church fathers. \n\n \n Everything that we have today including the NT comes from the early Church fathers, those who walked and talked with Jesus. The NT itself was not biblical, it was the church who decided it was biblicall, the whole of the NT gets its biblical authority form the Church.\n \n \nWhy would you want a Christian doctrine that wasn't Biblically based?\n\n \n Biblically based or biblically supported?\n \n You see there are plenty of Catholic doctrines that are not biblically based, the reason for this is because Christ didnt Give the authority to Scripture \"sola scriptura\" but to his apostles, now John makes it quite clear that not everything Jesus said or did or even taught are in the bible but that the bible was writen only so that we can have faith, St Paul uses a teaching of Christ in Acts (20:35) that is nowhere to be found in the gospels. However I do not know of one doctrine of the Catholic Church that is not biblically supported.\n \n Trinity is a prime example of a doctrine that is not based on scripture but supported by Scripture!\n \n Indulgences is a doctrine that is supported by Scripture.\n \n Selling indulgence is not a doctrine but was an abuse of a doctrine by some priests.\n \n \nThe Bible is the basis of Christianity, because from it we get Christ and the teachings of the apostles.\n\n \n \n Jesus Wrote nothing !\n \n There is other documents outside of the bible that the apostles wrote that are considered by Catholics as part of the single deposit of faith. these and other documents are known as sacred tradition and are united to sacred scripture to make up one single deposit of faith. letters and such things as the didache (the teaching of the 12) the bible tells us to hold fast to the teachings by letter or by oral...just because its not inculded in the bible dosnt make it unimportant.",

   "There are some tenets in religious groups that I would agree to your point, but not the Trinity. I see no reason to think that when the Bible says \"the Spirit of God\" moved over the face of the waters, when previously it said only \"God\", that there's both the element of God and the Spirit at play there. And the NT is full of examples of \"the Holy Spirit\", and examples of \"the Son.\" The Trinity is simply acknowledgement of all three elements clearly present in scripture.\n \n \n \n I don't think so--I think I am addressing common misunderstandings and assumptions about sola scriptura. Wikipedia says it pretty well . . .\n \"Sola scriptura (Latin for scripture alone) is one of five important slogans of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. Although there is no agreed-upon technical definition among Protestants, it generally meant that Scripture is the only inerrant rule for deciding issues of faith and morals. The key implication of the slogan is that interpretations of how to understand and apply Scripture would not bear the same authority as Scripture itself, and that therefore the individual Christian is subject not to the interpretations of any ecclesiastical authority but only to his own interpretation.\"\n\n \n There is no trinity in the 'spirit of God' at all. The spirit of God is God making an action of Creation. You have to remember that the 'Spirit of God' in hebrew is feminine in format, and not male, as it is in latin. The 'spirit' of god is not a seperate 'person', as it has been reinterpreted by those people who believe in the trinity.. but is synomomous with God.\n \n As far as the \"new testament\", you also have to assume the trinity, and you have to assume that the son of god is god also. For each and every passage there is a reasonable alternative explaination that does not involve the assumption that 'the father the son and the holy ghost are three people with one divine nature'.",

The 'spirit' of god is not a seperate 'person', as it has been reinterpreted by those people who believe in the trinity.. but is synomomous with God.\n\n \n The Holy Spirit is a Person - God!\n \n Isaiah 63:10 reads,\n \n \"But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore He was\n turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.\"\n \n The word \"vexed,\" as used above, is the Hebrew word \"atsab,\" which means \"to worry, pain, or anger; to grieve, hurt, or make sorry\" (Zodhiates Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary section, page 91). The question, of course, is \"How can some inanimate force be angered or grieved, as we see occurred in the above passage? Only if the Holy Spirit was alive and possessed personal attributes could He experience these types of emotions.\" The Holy Spirit must therefore be a person. \n \n Other \"personal\" attributes of the Holy Spirit are as follows:\n \n 1. The Holy Spirit \"testifies\" (Nehemiah 9:30).\n 2. The Spirit \"instructs\" (Nehemiah 9:20).\n 3. The Spirit \"strives with men\" (Genesis 6:3).\n 4. The Spirit sends messengers (Isaiah 48:16).\n 5. The Spirit enabled Joseph to interpret Pharoah's dreams (Genesis 41:38).\n 6. The Spirit gives wisdom (Exodus 28:3; 31:1-6; 35:31).\n 7. The Holy Spirit is the \"Spirit of Wisdom\" (Isaiah 11:2).\n 8. He is the Spirit of Knowledge (Isaiah 11:2)\n \n Notice clearly that all of the things that the Holy Spirit does requires intelligence of the variety that only God alone can possess. This ties God and the Holy Spirit together in a most closely-knit and inseparable unity. \n \n Considering the aforementioned evidence, we can only conclude that Holy Spirit is a living person (diety), who possesses many of the same intellectual and creative attributes as the Almighty God.\n \n By the way, Job 19:25 states, \"For I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end He will stand upon the earth.\" (which Jesus did).\n \n \n As far as the \"new testament\", you also have to assume the trinity, and you have to assume that the son of god is god also. \n\n \n Nope. It's pretty clear to anyone who isn't brainwashed by false doctrines. The Father is God; Jesus is God (dozens of Scriptures); and the Holy Spirit is God (Acts 5). No need for asumptions here.",

   "Jyoshu,\n \nBut the issue of whether the elements are representative or literally His body isn't as big a deal to me as other matters, such as the idea of the eucharist needed as a means of atonement every time.\n\n It should be a big deal. What power and grace would be present in such an intimate communion with our Lord and Savior in this way??\n \n \nFirst, sola scriptura isn't a \"doctrine.\" It simply means \"only the scriptures.\" It's a way of viewing the role of the Bible in the Christian life and came about in Reformation because Catholicism had added so much stuff that wasn't there such as the buying and selling of indulgences. In defense of sola scriptura, if doctrines are extra-Biblical, then they aren't Biblical doctrines to begin with, right? Why would you want a Christian doctrine that wasn't Biblically based?\n\n \n \nBut I don't agree with the extra-Biblical doctrines.\n\n Not all Catholic doctrines are explicit in Scripture. Many are implicit. But none are contradictory to scripture or contradicted by scripture.\n \n If we knew all of your beliefs and practices then I am certain we would find some \"extra-biblical\" ones. As we have already mentioned, sola scriptura is one. \n \n It is dangerous to adhere to sola scriptura because you end up rejecting parts of Christianity that have been there from the beginning but which you cannot see due to a new interpretation of scripture and a lack of adherence to Holy Tradition. It is dangerous to limit yourself to scripture because then you will miss the FULL revelation that God made to his people (Read John 21:25 and 2 Thessalonians 2:15 notice that Paul tells us to heed the oral word and tradition) The Word of God is not limited to the pages of the Bible, the Word was made flesh and he will be with us until the end of time. The Word is a living, organic Word conveyed fully by the Church (Ephesians 3:10, 1 Timothy 3:15). \n \n More instructions by Paul to adhere to oral and other Tradition: 1 Corinthians 11:2, 2 Thessalonians 3:6\n \n \nSuch as? Any doctrines I hold to held by the early church fathers are Biblical as well, IMO. It's often claimed, for example, that the Trinity is extra-Biblical because \"trinity\" is not found anywhere in the Bible. And yet the elements of the Trinity are found all through the Bible. Because of that, anyone is going to be very hard-pressed to convince me that the doctrine of Trinity is not Biblical.\n\n The Church Fathers believed in the Real Presence of the Eucharist as taught by the Catholic Church:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Real_Presence.asp\n \n Do you now believe in its authenticity? (Were the scriptures supplied in the other post I linked you to not sufficient?)\n \n \n To elaborate on what INRI wrote on the Apocrypha:\n \n These books were not added to scripture by Catholics, they were deleted by Protestants--Martin Luther actually followed through with cutting these out as he wanted to do with Revelation and James.\n \n From James Akin's website, http://www.jamesakin.com\n \n \"Who Compiled the Old Testament?\n \n The Church does not deny that there are ancient writings which are \"apocryphal.\" During the early Christian era, there were scores of manuscripts which purported to be Holy Scripture but were not. Many have survived to the present day, like the Apocalypse of Peter and the Gospel of Thomas, which all Christian churches regard as spurious writings that don't belong in Scripture.\n \n During the first century, the Jews disagreed as to what constituted the canon of Scripture. In fact, there were a large number of different canons in use, including the growing canon used by Christians. In order to combat the spreading Christian cult, rabbis met at the city of Jamnia or Javneh in A.D. 90 to determine which books were truly the Word of God. They pronounced many books, including the Gospels, to be unfit as scriptures. This canon also excluded seven books (Baruch, Sirach, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Tobit, Judith, and the Wisdom of Solomon, plus portions of Esther and Daniel) that Christians considered part of the Old Testament.\n \n The group of Jews which met at Javneh became the dominant group for later Jewish history, and today most Jews accept the canon of Javneh. However, some Jews, such as those from Ethiopia, follow a different canon which is identical to the Catholic Old Testament and includes the seven deuterocanonical books (cf. Encyclopedia Judaica, vol. 6, p. 1147).\n \n Needless to say, the Church disregarded the results of Javneh. First, a Jewish council after the time of Christ is not binding on the followers of Christ. Second, Javneh rejected precisely those documents which are foundational for the Christian Church -- the Gospels and the other documents of the New Testament. Third, by rejecting the deuterocanonicals, Javneh rejected books which had been used by Jesus and the apostles and which were in the edition of the Bible that the apostles used in everyday life -- the Septuagint.\n \n The Apostles & the Deuteros\n The Christian acceptance of the deuterocanonical books was logical because the deuterocanonicals were also included in the Septuagint, the Greek edition of the Old Testament which the apostles used to evangelize the world. Two thirds of the Old Testament quotations in the New are from the Septuagint. Yet the apostles nowhere told their converts to avoid seven books of it. Like the Jews all over the world who used the Septuagint, the early Christians accepted the books they found in it. They knew that the apostles would not mislead them and endanger their souls by putting false scriptures in their hands -- especially without warning them against them.\n But the apostles did not merely place the deuterocanonicals in the hands of their converts as part of the Septuagint. They regularly referred to the deuterocanonicals in their writings. For example, Hebrews 11 encourages us to emulate the heroes of the Old Testament and in the Old Testament \"Women received their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, that they might rise again to a better life\" (Heb. 11:35).\n There are a couple of examples of women receiving back their dead by resurrection in the Protestant Old Testament. You can find Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarepheth in 1 Kings 17, and you can find his successor Elisha raising the son of the Shunammite woman in 2 Kings 4, but one thing you can never find -- anywhere in the Protestant Old Testament, from front to back, from Genesis to Malachi -- is someone being tortured and refusing to accept release for the sake of a better resurrection. If you want to find that, you have to look in the Catholic Old Testament -- in the deuterocanonical books Martin Luther cut out of his Bible.\n Hebrews 11:35 is an indisputable reference to 2 Maccabees 7, but many are not so clear as there may be only a single phrase that echoes one in a deuterocanonical book (and this may not be obvious in the translation, but only the original languages). \n \n The story is found in 2 Maccabees 7, where we read that during the Maccabean persecution, \"It happened also that seven brothers and their mother were arrested and were being compelled by the king, under torture with whips and cords, to partake of unlawful swine's flesh. . . . but the brothers and their mother encouraged one another to die nobly, saying, 'The Lord God is watching over us and in truth has compassion on us . . . ' After the first brother had died . . . they brought forward the second for their sport. . . . he in turn underwent tortures as the first brother had done. And when he was at his last breath, he said, 'You accursed wretch, you dismiss us from this present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life'\" (2 Macc. 7:1, 5-9).\n One by one the sons die, proclaiming that they will be vindicated in the resurrection. \"The mother was especially admirable and worthy of honorable memory. Though she saw her seven sons perish within a single day, she bore it with good courage because of her hope in the Lord. She encouraged each of them . . . [saying], 'I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within each of you. Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws,'\" telling the last one, \"Do not fear this butcher, but prove worthy of your brothers. Accept death, so that in God's mercy I may get you back again with your brothers\" (2 Macc. 7:20-23, 29).\n This is but one example of the New Testaments' references to the deuterocanonicals. The early Christians were thus fully justified in recognizing these books as Scripture, for the apostles not only set them in their hands as part of the Bible they used to evangelize the world, but also referred to them in the New Testament itself, citing the things they record as examples to be emulated.\" \n \n See also the literary parallels between Wisdom and Paul's Letter to the Romans (Romans 1: 20-29 with Wisdom 13:5,8; 14:24, 27 and Romans 9:20-23 with Wisdom 12:12,20; 15:7) as well as Corinthians (compare 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 with Wisdom 9:15) The Letter of James contains allusions to Proverbs and Sirach (James 1:19 with Sirach 5:11; James 1:13 with Sirach15:11-12) (Unabridged Christianity by Father Mario P. Romero)",

   " EZ, would you mind dropping the rhetoric? trebor is making a perfectly valid point that reading the Old Testament alone the trinity is not an obvious conclusion to draw.\n\n \n It may not be as obvious as people would like to see, but it's there nevertheless. Even ancient Rabbis alluded to it, i.e.\n \n The Trinity As Taught by the Ancient Jewish Sages\n \n Do the ancient Jewish books such as the Zohar and the Targums actually refer to the Trinity and clearly describe the plural nature of God? Consider the following statements:\n \n \"How can they (the three) be One? Are they verily One, because we call them One ?\n How Three can be One, can only be known through the revelation of the Holy Spirit.\"7\n \n According to the Zohar, one day Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai was teaching his son Rabbi Eliezer about the mystery of the triune nature of God. He instructed his pupil by saying, \"Come and see the mystery of the word hwhy, Jehova: there are three steps, each existing by itself; nevertheless they are One, and so united that one cannot be separated from the other.\"8\n \n Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai indicates in another passage of the Zohar that these three steps as revealed in Elohim Myhla (God) are three substantive beings or three divine persons united in one.\n \n The Ancient Holy One is revealed with three Heads, which are united in One, and that Head is thrice exalted. The Ancient Holy one is described as being Three; it is because the other Lights emanating from Him are included in the Three. Yet the Ancient One is described as being two. The Ancient One includes these two. He is the Crown of all that is exalted; the Chief of the chief, so exalted, that He cannot be known to perfection. Thus the other lights are two complete ones, yet is the Ancient Holy One described complete as one, and He is one, positively one; thus are the other lights united and glorified in because they are one.9\n \n Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai wrote a fascinating passage recorded in the Zohar that is as clear a discussion of the mystery of the Trinity as you could find in any Christian theology text. Rabbi Simeon comments on the text found in Deuteronomy 32:39: \"See now that I, I am he, and Elohim is not with me.\"10\n \n He said: \"Friends, here are some profound mysteries which I desire to reveal to you now that permission has been given to utter them. Who is it that says, 'See now that I, I am He?' This is the Cause which is above all those on high, that which is called the Cause of causes. It is above those other causes, since none of those causes does anything till it obtains permission from that which is above it, as we pointed out above in respect to the expression, 'Let us make man.' 'Us' certainly refers to two, of which one said to the other above it, 'Let us make,' nor did it do anything save with the permission and direction of the one above it, while the one above did nothing without consulting its colleague. But that which is called 'the Cause above all causes,' which has no superior or even equal, as it is written, 'To whom shall ye liken me, that I should be equal?' (referring to Isaiah 40:25), said, 'See now that I, I am he, and Elohim is not with me,' from whom he should take counsel, like that of which it is written, 'and God said, Let us make man.'\"\n \n Another book written by Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, known as The Propositions of the Zohar, records the mystery of the Shechinah glory of God in these words.\n \n . . . the exalted Shechinah comprehends the Three highest Sephiroth; of Him (God) it is said, (Ps. lxii. 12), \"God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this.\" Once and twice means the Three exalted Sephiroth, of whom it is said: Once, once, and once; that is, Three united in One. This is the mystery.11\n \n Another famous Jewish scholar, Rabbi Eliezer Hakkalir, who lived at the time of Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, also taught the scriptural doctrine that there were three distinct Beings revealed in the one unified Godhead. In his commentary on Genesis 1:1, Rabbi Hakkalir wrote the following:\n \n When God created the world, He created it through the Three Sephiroth, namely, through Sepher, Sapher and Vesaphur, by which the Three twywh (Beings) are meant . . . The Rabbi, my Lord Teacher of blessed memory, explained Sepher, Sapher, and Sippur, to be synonymous to Ja, Jehovah, and Elohim meaning to say, that the world was created by these three names.12\n \n Rabbi Bechai, in his commentary on Genesis 1:1 (p. 1, col. 2) explained that the word Elohim Myhla is compounded of two words, Mh and la, that is, \"These are God.\" The plural is expressed by the letter jod (y).\n \n Another extraordinary reference to the Trinity is found in the Zohar :\n \n Here is the secret of two names combined which are completed by a third and become one again. \"And God said Let us make Man.\" It is written, \"The secret of the Lord is to them that fear him\" (Psalm 25:34). That most reverend Elder opened an exposition of this verse by saying \"Simeon Simeon, who is it that said: 'Let us make man?' Who is this Elohim?\" With these words the most reverend Elder vanished before anyone saw him . . . Truly now is the time to expound this mystery, because certainly there is here a mystery which hitherto it was not permitted to divulge, but now we perceive that permission is given.\" He then proceeded: \"We must picture a king who wanted several buildings to be erected, and who had an architect in his service who did nothing save with his consent. The king is the supernal wisdom above, the Central Column being the king below: Elohim is the architect above . . . and Elohim is also the architect below, being as such the Divine Presence (Shekinah) of the lower world.13\n \n Rabbi Menachem of Recanati, writing in his Commentary on the Pentateuch about the Deuteronomy 6:4 (Shema) passage, also clearly describes the mystery of the Trinity, the threefold Unity of the Godhead. Rabbi Menachem wrote about these mysteries and concluded, \"These are secrets which are revealed only to those who are reaping upon the holy field, as it is written 'The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him'\" (Psalms 25:14). Rabbi Menachem wrote the following on the Trinity:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our god is one Lord.\" This verse is the root of our faith, therefore Moses records it after the ten commandments. The reason (that there is said hwhy, Lord, Myhla, our God, and hwhy, Lord) is, because the word emv does not here signify \"Hear;\" but \"to gather together, to unite,\" as in 1 Samuel 15:4, \"Saul gathered together the people.\" The meaning implied is The Inherent-Ones are so united together, one in the other without end, they being the exalted God. He mentions the three names mystically to indicate the three exalted original Ones.15\n \n http://www.grantjeffrey.com/article/chphnwr.htm\n \n And even after all that, Trebor has to ignore all the evidence from the New Testament (which is the Word of God) that makes it even clearer.\n \n \n Exhortations to prayer do not make it more likely that trebor will agree with you, and hence serve no purpose, either in the context of this discussion or as a means of conversion.\n\n \n Disagree. You're assuming Jesus won't help enlighten him if he sincerely prays about it? \n \n \n Accusing those who disagree with you of stupor is not particularly polite either.\n\n \n Politeness and reason hasn't worked with Trebor either, as some here could tell you. But maybe you can get through to him before it's too late?",

   "It may not be as obvious as people would like to see, but it's there nevertheless. Even ancient Rabbis alluded to it, i.e.\n \n The Trinity As Taught by the Ancient Jewish Sages\n \n Do the ancient Jewish books such as the Zohar and the Targums actually refer to the Trinity and clearly describe the plural nature of God? Consider the following statements:\n \n \"How can they (the three) be One? Are they verily One, because we call them One ?\n How Three can be One, can only be known through the revelation of the Holy Spirit.\"7\n \n According to the Zohar, one day Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai was teaching his son Rabbi Eliezer about the mystery of the triune nature of God. He instructed his pupil by saying, \"Come and see the mystery of the word hwhy, Jehova: there are three steps, each existing by itself; nevertheless they are One, and so united that one cannot be separated from the other.\"8\n \n Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai indicates in another passage of the Zohar that these three steps as revealed in Elohim Myhla (God) are three substantive beings or three divine persons united in one.\n \n The Ancient Holy One is revealed with three Heads, which are united in One, and that Head is thrice exalted. The Ancient Holy one is described as being Three; it is because the other Lights emanating from Him are included in the Three. Yet the Ancient One is described as being two. The Ancient One includes these two. He is the Crown of all that is exalted; the Chief of the chief, so exalted, that He cannot be known to perfection. Thus the other lights are two complete ones, yet is the Ancient Holy One described complete as one, and He is one, positively one; thus are the other lights united and glorified in because they are one.9\n \n Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai wrote a fascinating passage recorded in the Zohar that is as clear a discussion of the mystery of the Trinity as you could find in any Christian theology text. Rabbi Simeon comments on the text found in Deuteronomy 32:39: \"See now that I, I am he, and Elohim is not with me.\"10\n \n He said: \"Friends, here are some profound mysteries which I desire to reveal to you now that permission has been given to utter them. Who is it that says, 'See now that I, I am He?' This is the Cause which is above all those on high, that which is called the Cause of causes. It is above those other causes, since none of those causes does anything till it obtains permission from that which is above it, as we pointed out above in respect to the expression, 'Let us make man.' 'Us' certainly refers to two, of which one said to the other above it, 'Let us make,' nor did it do anything save with the permission and direction of the one above it, while the one above did nothing without consulting its colleague. But that which is called 'the Cause above all causes,' which has no superior or even equal, as it is written, 'To whom shall ye liken me, that I should be equal?' (referring to Isaiah 40:25), said, 'See now that I, I am he, and Elohim is not with me,' from whom he should take counsel, like that of which it is written, 'and God said, Let us make man.'\"\n \n Another book written by Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, known as The Propositions of the Zohar, records the mystery of the Shechinah glory of God in these words.\n \n . . . the exalted Shechinah comprehends the Three highest Sephiroth; of Him (God) it is said, (Ps. lxii. 12), \"God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this.\" Once and twice means the Three exalted Sephiroth, of whom it is said: Once, once, and once; that is, Three united in One. This is the mystery.11\n \n Another famous Jewish scholar, Rabbi Eliezer Hakkalir, who lived at the time of Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, also taught the scriptural doctrine that there were three distinct Beings revealed in the one unified Godhead. In his commentary on Genesis 1:1, Rabbi Hakkalir wrote the following:\n \n When God created the world, He created it through the Three Sephiroth, namely, through Sepher, Sapher and Vesaphur, by which the Three twywh (Beings) are meant . . . The Rabbi, my Lord Teacher of blessed memory, explained Sepher, Sapher, and Sippur, to be synonymous to Ja, Jehovah, and Elohim meaning to say, that the world was created by these three names.12\n \n Rabbi Bechai, in his commentary on Genesis 1:1 (p. 1, col. 2) explained that the word Elohim Myhla is compounded of two words, Mh and la, that is, \"These are God.\" The plural is expressed by the letter jod (y).\n \n Another extraordinary reference to the Trinity is found in the Zohar :\n \n Here is the secret of two names combined which are completed by a third and become one again. \"And God said Let us make Man.\" It is written, \"The secret of the Lord is to them that fear him\" (Psalm 25:34). That most reverend Elder opened an exposition of this verse by saying \"Simeon Simeon, who is it that said: 'Let us make man?' Who is this Elohim?\" With these words the most reverend Elder vanished before anyone saw him . . . Truly now is the time to expound this mystery, because certainly there is here a mystery which hitherto it was not permitted to divulge, but now we perceive that permission is given.\" He then proceeded: \"We must picture a king who wanted several buildings to be erected, and who had an architect in his service who did nothing save with his consent. The king is the supernal wisdom above, the Central Column being the king below: Elohim is the architect above . . . and Elohim is also the architect below, being as such the Divine Presence (Shekinah) of the lower world.13\n \n Rabbi Menachem of Recanati, writing in his Commentary on the Pentateuch about the Deuteronomy 6:4 (Shema) passage, also clearly describes the mystery of the Trinity, the threefold Unity of the Godhead. Rabbi Menachem wrote about these mysteries and concluded, \"These are secrets which are revealed only to those who are reaping upon the holy field, as it is written 'The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him'\" (Psalms 25:14). Rabbi Menachem wrote the following on the Trinity:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our god is one Lord.\" This verse is the root of our faith, therefore Moses records it after the ten commandments. The reason (that there is said hwhy, Lord, Myhla, our God, and hwhy, Lord) is, because the word emv does not here signify \"Hear;\" but \"to gather together, to unite,\" as in 1 Samuel 15:4, \"Saul gathered together the people.\" The meaning implied is The Inherent-Ones are so united together, one in the other without end, they being the exalted God. He mentions the three names mystically to indicate the three exalted original Ones.15\n \n http://www.grantjeffrey.com/article/chphnwr.htm\n \n And even after all that, Trebor has to ignore all the evidence from the New Testament (which is the Word of God) that makes it even clearer.\n \n \n \n Disagree. You're assuming Jesus won't help enlighten him if he sincerely prays about it? \n \n \n \n Politeness and reason hasn't worked with Trebor either, as some here could tell you. But maybe you can get through to him before it's too late?\n\n \n \n You make a lot of claims about the zohar, Or rather Jeffery Grant does.\n \n Do you have the chapter and verse, so it can be looked up in context?? A lot of evangalists lie about the Jewish writings. \n \n You attempt to retrofit the trinity into the Jewish scriptures is pathetic though.",

Besides, Jeffrey gave references at the bottom.\n \n \n \n Be polite, Trebor, lest Jito and Jo Bennett get even tempered and call you out. LOL!\n\n \n Really?? I couldn't see anyting from the zohar.\n \n However, as counterpoint\n \n http://www.messiahtruth.com/zohar.html\n \n There seems to be a trend in Missionary literature to make appeals to things that are written in Kabbalistic works. The obvious reason is that there are few people who have any idea what appears in them, and what they mean. This makes it easy to make whatever claim the missionary wants to make. The Zohar has become an especial favorite because it's obtuse and allegorical language makes it easy to take a sentence or two out of context, and make it appear to say whatever the missionary wants even if this claim contradicts what the Zohar says explicitly in other places.\n \n \n \n According to Jewish tradition the author of the Zohar was Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who lived in the 2nd Century CE.[2] The Zohar is made up of various books. We can talk about them as if they were only three (although there is more then that). The First is the Holy Zohar itself. That is a three-volume Kabbalistic Midrashic commentary on the Torah (first 5 books of the Tenach). It has a few sub-divisions in it, some more esoteric then others. Some appear no different then a standard Midrash, but most of it is esoteric in nature. The second book is called Tekunei HaZohar (the Rectifications of the Zohar). This is VERY esoteric and involves Kabbalistic discussions and understandings of many of the Biblical commandments. It is based on discussions of the first word in the Torah. It has 70 chapters, or Tikkunim, of varied length, followed by a few additions in the back. The third section is called the Zohar Chadash. It is like the Zohar, but smaller. It also has Midrashic material on 3 of the 5 Magillas (Ruth, Song of Songs, Lamentations) and it's own Tikkunim.\n \n \n \n Within this collection of around 1000 pages there are a few passages where verses from Isaiah 53 are mentioned. Who is referred to at the time is not always the same. What I will do is bring all the references that, for some obvious reasons, are NOT mentioned by the missionaries, and then we can discuss the one that is mentioned.\n \n \n \n In discussion of Kabbalistic concepts we have 5 references in Isaiah:\n \n \n \n 1. 52:13 in Zohar Volume III 246b.\n 2. 53:1 in Tekunei HaZohar page 28a; Zohar Volume I 253a.\n 3. 53:5 in Zohar Chadash page 91a\n 4. 53:7 in Zohar Volume I 137b.\n \n \n \n Verse 53:10 is applied to the soul in the Zohar Volume I page 168a.\n \n \n \n There are numerous individuals that the Zohar applies Isaiah 53 to:\n \n \n \n 1. 52:13-14 is applied to the Angel Metatron in Zohar Volume I 182a.\n 2. 53:5 is applied to Elijah the prophet in Zohar Volume II 115b.\n 3. 53:5 is applied to Moshiach ben Yosef in Zohar Volume III 276b.\n \n \n \n Then we have the following seven references to Moses:\n \n \n \n 1. 52:13 in Zohar Volume III page 153b.\n 2. 52:13, 53:2,5 in Zohar Volume III 280a.\n 3. 53:1 in Tekunei HaZohar page 43a.\n 4. 53:5 in Tekunei HaZohar page 54b and 112a.\n 5. 53:5,7 in Zohar Volume III 125b.\n 6. 53:5,6,7 in Zohar Volume III 282b.\n \n \n \n There are two references to Israel:\n \n \n \n 1. 53:7 in Zohar Volume I 187a.\n 2. 53:10 in Zohar Volume II 29b.\n \n \n \n There are 8 references to the Righteous of Israel:\n \n \n \n 1. 52:12 in Zohar Chadash page 15a\n 2. 52:13 in Zohar Volume I 181a.\n 3. 53:5 in Zohar Volume III 218a, 231a, 247b\n 4. 53:10 in Zohar Volume I 140a; Volume II 244b; Volume III 57b\n \n \n \n To summarize: Five of the occurrences deal with Kabbalistic subjects and do not refer to people at all. The most common subject of Isaiah 53 in the Zohar is the righteous of Israel (8) and two more referring to Israel following the view of the Jewish commentators. The next in order of occurrences is Moses (7). The four of the other five occurrences are one each for the Messiah the son of Joseph (a descendant of Jeroboam the son of Nevat), the angel Metatron, Elijah the prophet and the soul. I think this alone shows that to make a claim that 'the Zohar teaches that Isaiah 53 refers to X' is just not true.\n \n \n \n The fact is that this should be enough to end discussion on this issue. However, I wish to deal with that passage used by missionaries, and discuss what it is really about. It teaches us some very important theological issues, and gives us an understanding of many things that are found in other Rabbinic works.\n \n \n \n The passage appears in the Zohar Volume II 212a and references the verses Isaiah 53:4,5.[3] This passage is quoted many times as a 'proof' that according to the Zohar the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 is the Messiah. Let's look at the English version that is most often used:[4]\n \n \n \n \"There is in the Garden of Eden a palace named the Palace of the Sons of Sickness. This palace the Messiah enters, and He summons every pain and every chastisement of Israel. All of these come and rest upon Him. And had He not thus lightened them upon Himself, there had been no man able to bear Israel's chastisements for the transgressions of the law; as it is written, \"Surely our sicknesses he has carried.\"\n \n \n \n Before discussing this passage we need to know that it is abridged, and much of the important context is lost because of that.[5] In order to fully understand this passage I need to explain another Rabbinic text that is also quoted to prove that the Rabbis agree that the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 is the Messiah. This is the musaf prayer for Yom Kippur.[6] Here is the text as usually quoted:\n \n \n \n \"Our righteous anointed is departed from us: horror hath seized us, and we have none to justify us. He hath borne the yoke of our iniquities, and our transgression, and is wounded because of our transgression. He beareth our sins on his shoulder, that he may find pardon for our iniquities. We shall be healed by his wound, at the time that the Eternal will create him (the Messiah) as a new creature. O bring him up from the circle of the earth. Raise him up from Seir, to assemble us the second time on Mount Lebanon, by the hand of Yinnon.\"[7]\n \n \n \n In order to understand this passage I need to give a little historical background. The author of this payyut (religious poem) is Rabbi Eluzer HaKalir. He was a Kabbalist, and some believe he was the son of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, although others place him around the 9th century CE. This above passage is only a small part of the payyut that is called 'Az MeLifnei Beraishis' (Then before the world was created). It is made up of four parts and is said in the middle of the Kedusha for the Musuf prayer of Yom Kippur in a number of Jewish communities.\n \n \n \n Let me here translate the whole section in which that above passage appears:\n \n \n \n Then before Creation;\n \n The Holy Temple and Yanin were prepared;\n \n An exalted place of prayer from the beginning;\n \n was prepared before there was any people or language.\n \n \n \n It was strong for the Shechina to rest there;\n \n Unintentional sinners were shown the upright way;\n \n The wicked whose sins that were red;\n \n were washed and purified to be as they were before.\n \n \n \n If He was angry with an anger causing fear;\n \n Holy One do not bring all your anger;\n \n Even if we have continued to steal until this time;\n \n Our Rock will not bring a plague on us.\n \n \n \n Our righteous Moshiach has been removed from us;\n \n We are beaten and none is here to stand for our righteousness;\n \n Our sins and the yoke of our rebellion are upon him;\n \n He is wounded from our rebellion.\n \n \n \n From the earth raise him,\n \n From Seir rise up;\n \n To gather us on Mount Lebanon,[8]\n \n again by the hand of Yanin.\n \n \n \n The simple meaning of this prayer is that we had a Holy Temple for atonement, and now we are in exile, and when Moshiach comes he shall return us to the Holy Temple. (Mount Lebanon) When looking at this passage in full it is somewhat difficult to see what the missionaries are trying to say. Certainly seeing this passage in the context of those before and after, it is hard to see the point they are making.\n \n \n \n This payyut is based on the teaching in the Midrash Tanchuma parshas Nasa 11, page 506 in the standard Hebrew edition. There it says:\n \n \n \n \" 'Teach us, our Rabbi, how many things were created before the Creation of the world?' 'Thus taught our rabbis, \"Seven things were created before the world was created. They are: (1) the throne of glory (2) the Torah (3) the Temple (4) the Patriarchs (Abraham Isaac and Jacob) (5) The people Israel (6) the name of the Messiah (7) repentance.\" '\"\n \n \n \n When we look at the payyut we see that each section of it mentions some of these things. The first part: The Torah and the Throne of Glory. The second: The Patriarchs and Israel. The third: Messiah and the Temple. The fourth: repentance. The whole history of the Jewish people is woven into this Midrash.\n \n \n \n I would like to point out a few things that are interesting and important in this Midrash and also in the payyut that come up in discussions about the beliefs of the rabbis. These relate directly to our understanding of what the meaning of this payyut is.\n \n \n \n 1. These 7 things were considered necessary for the world to be able to exist, and achieve the purpose for which the world was created.\n \n 2. Notice that in the Midrash only the NAME of the Messiah is preexistent not the Messiah himself (However with regards to the patriarchs, and Israel, they are considered preexistent.)\n \n 3. In the Midrash the proof of this preexistent name is based on the rabbinic interpretation of Psalms 72:17 which literally says: \"His name should last forever, may his name last as long as the sun\", which they interpret as meaning \"His name shall forever endure, before the sun (was made) Yanin was his name.\" As I have mentioned the Rabbis many times took verses out of context to teach spiritual lessons, this is an example of that. This in fact appears in the passage from the payyut.\n \n 4. Each part of the payyut relates to part of the Kedusha prayer.\n \n a. The first part that talks of how G-d's glory fills the world and it is related to the Torah and the Throne of Glory that are examples of G-d's presence. \n \n b. The second which deals with the proclaiming of G-d's oneness relates to the Patriarchs and Israel who sanctify G-d's name and proclaim his oneness.\n \n c. The third, which talks of how we shall be taken from exile, mentions the Temple and the Messiah. \n \n d. The final portion proclaiming G-d's kingship is associated with repentance, which is to accept G-d as king and follow his commands.\n \n 5. Repentance appears alone in the last section of the payyut. If you read that section you see that repentance is the most important of the seven things.\n \n 6. Significantly, the third and fourth parts talk about sin, with the difference that the third discusses sin in relation to the exile and a return to the temple, while the fourth discusses it with regards to individual repentance. They are taken as separate issues.\n \n \n \n With these points in mind let's consider one important principle that is taught in the Tenach, but is often missed. It is one that in Judaism has an important place in both theology and in our prayers. That is 'sin'. But not just simply sin, but the idea of communal sin. The concept of \"we and our fathers have sinned'. (Jer. 3:25) The concept of communal sin is that the community as a whole is responsible and punishable for the sins of members of the community, both now and in the past. This idea is seen most clearly in the book of Joshua where the people were punished for the sin of one person, Achan. There are numerous examples of this.\n \n \n \n One principle is clear in the Tenach and that is: if a person sins he will be punished unless he repents of his sins. Let's look at Ezekiel 3:\n \n \n \n 18 When I say unto the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.\n \n \n \n 19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.\n \n \n \n 20 Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.\n \n \n \n 21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.'\n \n \n \n Now 33:11-20:\n \n \n \n 11 Say unto them: As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 12 And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people: The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not stumble thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.\n \n \n \n 13 When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, for it shall he die.\n \n \n \n 14 Again, when I say unto the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;\n \n \n \n 15 if the wicked restore the pledge, give back that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.\n \n \n \n 16 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him; he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.\n \n \n \n 17 Yet the children of thy people say: The way of the Lord is not equal; but as for them, their way is not equal.\n \n \n \n 18 When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.\n \n \n \n 19 And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.\n \n \n \n 20 Yet ye say: The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.'\n \n \n \n We see from these passages that the wicked die from their sins. It is clear that this death is the cutting off of the soul, the spiritual death of Numbers 15:30-31.\n \n \n \n 30 But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\n \n \n \n 31 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken His commandment; that soul shall utterly be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him.\n \n \n \n There is also a clear promise of punishments in THIS world for sins. This is found in many places in the Torah like Deut. 28:15-68. From this we see that sin has TWO aspects. There is a spiritual punishment in the future, and a punishment of suffering in this world. But these punishments are for different things. We shall see exile and punishment in this world is primarily for the sins of the people, and the punishment for the world to come is ONLY for individual sins.\n \n \n \n The question is: Can someone die or suffer in this world in order to bring atonement for the sinner so that the sinner will not suffer spiritual death, or any other Biblical punishment for the individual? The answer is no. There is no example in the Tenach of a person sinning and another person either being punished for this individual's sin, or being able to accept the punishment and atoning for the person's sin. The Torah says clearly that 'a father shall not die for the sin of the son'. This is even more clearly stated in Ezekiel 18 where the prophet discusses this in depth and clearly states in G-d's name that the sins of fathers (and hence any other person) do not effect the son.\n \n \n \n What about sacrifices? Are they not an example of another (the animal) dying and the person being atoned for? The answer is not really. For the sacrifice to be valid the person had to confess, as it says in Lev. 5:5 \"and it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned;\" He must repent, and have a change of heart. If not he could not bring the sacrifice. You could not be a 'sinner' and bring a sacrifice and expect it to be accepted. That is the message of the prophet Isaiah in the first chapter:\n \n \n \n 11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? saith the LORD; I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.\n \n \n \n 12 When ye come to appear before Me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample My courts?\n \n \n \n 13 Bring no more vain oblations; it is an offering of abomination unto Me; new moon and sabbath, the holding of convocations -I cannot endure iniquity along with the solemn assembly.\n \n \n \n 14 Your new moons and your appointed seasons My soul hateth; they are a burden unto Me; I am weary to bear them.\n \n \n \n 15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide Mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.\n \n \n \n 16 Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes, cease to do evil;\n \n \n \n 17 Learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.\n \n \n \n 18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\n \n \n \n 19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land;\n \n \n \n 20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken.\n \n \n \n Without the repentance of the individual the sacrifice was of no use.\n \n \n \n And more importantly there is absolutely no examples showing that Reuven could sin and Shimon could bring a sacrifice and that would work for Reuven. Reuven is ALWAYS responsible for his own sin. If he does not repent, then he suffers spiritual death and not just a physical one.\n \n \n \n This is nothing really new. However, the question of whether the whole Jewish people can be punished in this world for the sins of a few is another matter. If we look at Joshua 7, we see that a single individual, Achan, had sinned and did not follow the command of G-d, but the whole people is blamed.\n \n \n \n 1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass concerning the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing; and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.\n \n \n \n The Jewish people went up to war, and they did not succeed. There were a number of Jews killed. After which G-d states in verses 11-12: \n \n \n \n 11 Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing; and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have even put it among their own stuff.\n \n \n \n 12 Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed; I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.\n \n \n \n BUT only one person had sinned.\n \n \n \n Here we see a clear example of the community punished for the sins of the few. In fact this is clearly discussed in Deuteronomy 28, where they are told that punishment and exile will be the result for not following the commands of G-d. In the Tenach we see that the first exile to Babylonia was caused by the sins of Menashah, as it says\n \n \n \n 2 Kings 23:26 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of His great wrath, wherewith His anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked Him.\n \n \n \n Jer. 15:1 Then said the LORD unto me: 'Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, yet My mind could not be toward this people; cast them out of My sight, and let them go forth.\n \n \n \n 2 And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee: Whither shall we go forth? then thou shall tell them: Thus saith the LORD: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.\n \n \n \n 3 And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to drag, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.\n \n \n \n 4 And I will cause them to be a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.\n \n \n \n The exile as a collective punishment was caused by the sins of a few. Communal punishment CAN be caused by sins other then those by the individuals.\n \n \n \n No individual can die or suffer so that another individual will have atonement, but the whole community could suffer death and exile in this world due to the sins of individuals. That is the effect of the sin of the individual on the Jewish people as a whole.\n \n \n \n What about the opposite case? Can the death of a single person have an effect on the community and bring atonement for the communal sin? The answer is clearly no. There are no examples in the Tenach of the opposite. No righteous person dies and that causes the community to be forgiven of their sins.\n \n \n \n In fact in one instance in the Torah we see that someone tried and that G-d said it could not happen. When Israel sinned with the Golden Calf, Moses goes up to make atonement for them. Moses asked that he be removed from G-d's book (i.e. his soul should be destroyed), and Israel should not be punished for their sin. But G-d tells him no, the one who sinned will be blotted out.\n \n \n \n 30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people: 'Ye have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up unto the LORD, peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.'\n \n \n \n 31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said: 'Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them a god of gold.\n \n \n \n 32 Yet now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast written.'\n \n \n \n 33 And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Whosoever hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book.\n \n \n \n Those who sinned will be punished; an individual cannot make atonement for them!!!\n \n \n \n There is however a value in the death or suffering of the righteous that DOES effect the community. There are times G-d will take away the righteous from the world in order that the people left over will repent of their evil deeds. This is clearly stated in the prophet Isaiah 57:1, where we see that the righteous are taken from the world and the prophet complains that G-d has done this and no one has understood the message. They act as if they were themselves righteous, which they weren't, and they should have repented.\n \n \n \n 1 The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart, and godly men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.\n \n \n \n 2 He entereth into peace, they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness.\n \n \n \n It is clear in Rabbinic literature that the reason why the righteous suffer even when they have not sinned is so that those who see their suffering should repent of their sins. This is the message of Isaiah 57. This is similar to the reason why a sacrifice is brought for an unintentional sin. He should look at the innocent animal and say that I should be that sacrifice and repent of his sins. This is clearly stated in the Zohar (III 57b):\n \n \n \n \"All those who are pained by the suffering of the righteous their sins are removed from the world... all those that are pained from those righteous who have died, or who sheds tears for them, G-d proclaims over him, 'Your sins are remove, your iniquities removed.' Not just that, but his children will not die in his days as it says, 'He will see seed, and lengthen his days.' (Is 53:10)\"\n \n \n \n The suffering is to effect repentance and hence atonement of sin. Suffering does not atone. The repentance that one does because of the death or suffering of the righteous atones.\n \n \n \n This repentance is not related to the sins of one person alone but to the sins of the community as the Zohar states (III 118b):\n \n \n \n \"If the sins multiply in the world, then all the righteous suffer in order to cure (bring to repentance) the generation. But when they are not so much, then one righteous person suffers and the rest are left in peace because the world does not need their sufferings. If the people are cured (they repent) then the righteous are cured. There are times that righteous men suffer their whole lives to protect the generation. When the sins get very great, the righteous die, and that causes them to be cured, and they are forgiven\"\n \n \n \n Here we see three ideas with regards to the suffering of the righteous. \n \n \n \n 1. Their suffering makes it so that the rest of the generation need not suffer for communal sins. \n \n 2. The suffering comes so that the generation will see and get cured from their sins by repentance.\n \n 3. The number of righteous who must suffer depends on the sinfulness of the generation.\n \n \n \n We have almost all the pieces to understand the payyut, except the relationship to the Messiah. What kind of suffering can someone who has never come to this world have? There is in fact a source that is the basis for this payyut, but to understand it we need to look at a famous passage in the Talmud Sanhedrin 98a. Here we see that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi has a number of meetings with Elijah the prophet. (None of which appear to be in this world, but deal with either visitations through visions or the like, as he is described as meeting him at the gates of Gan Eden [heaven] and similar spots):\n \n \n \n \"Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked Elijah, \" 'When will the Messiah come?'\n \n He (Elijah) answered 'Go ask him'.\n \n Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked 'Where does he sit?'\n \n 'By the gates of Rome'\n \n 'How will I recognize him?'\n \n 'He sits with the poor who suffer sicknesses. They take off all their bandages at once, while he takes off one at a time so that should it be time for him to come he will not be held back'\n \n Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi went to him and said 'Peace to you my master and teacher'\n \n The Messiah responded 'Peace to you, son of Levi'\n \n 'When will the master come?'\n \n 'Today.'\n \n Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi went back to Elijah.\n \n Elijah asked him, 'What did he say?'\n \n 'Peace to you, son of Levi'.\n \n 'That means that he has assured both you and your father that you will have a place in the world to come'\n \n 'He lied to me. He said he would come today and he did not!'\n \n 'This is what he said, \"Today if you will listen to My (G-d) voice (Psalms 95:7)\"' \"\n \n \n \n To understand this we must remember one point from Jewish theology. That is that the souls have an independent existence that precedes that of the person, this includes the soul of the Messiah that exists even before his body does. The Talmud even states that the Messiah will not come until all those souls have entered this world.\n \n \n \n We see this concept very clearly laid out in a famous teaching in the work of Rabbi Chaim ben Attar, the Holy Or HaChaim. In Deuteronomy 15:7, the verse says, \"If there will be with you a poor man from among your brothers...\" he explains it as a Remez for some concepts dealing with the Messiah. Here is what he says:\n \n \n \n \"And in the method of Remez, it is to be a remez to us, in order to inspire us greatly with regards to one person, that special person among the people for whom we are anxiously waiting for the time when he will come. This is The King of Israel, our Moshiach who is a poor man. He has already been compared to a poor person as it says 'A poor man riding on a donkey.' (Zechariah 9:9) And the remez is that because of us he is made poor.\n \n \n \n And it says, 'with you'. This means because of you. Our sins have caused the lengthening of the time until the 'end'. Also the word 'with you' is a remez that the poor man is with us. He strongly desires for the time to come when he can redeem us from exile. You should go and learn this from what our Rabbis have taught with regards to the story of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. When the King Moshiach saw him he asked him how the Jewish people were doing in the world. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi answered him that they were sitting and waiting for him to come. When he heard this the pious one started to cry greatly because of his great desire to come and redeem them from exile.\"\n \n \n \n From these two sources, one based on the Talmud and the other Kabbalah, we see that the soul of Messiah suffers because he wants to come into this world and he is waiting to enter the world. This relates to the end of the exile, which comes when all will repent bringing an end to the Messiah's suffering.\n \n \n \n Now we can look at the passage that is used by the missionaries and relaters to the payyut that deals with the Messiah. It is in the Zohar (II 212a), where it says:\n \n \n \n \"After that they (i.e. these souls) journey and look upon those who are pained and sick and who have suffered for the Unity of their Master. They then return and tell this to the Messiah. When they tell to the Messiah about the suffering of Israel in exile and of the wicked ones who are among them who do not try to know their Master, he raises his voice and weeps because of the wicked ones among them, as it says. \"He was pained because of our rebellion and oppressed because if our sins.\" Then the souls return to their place.\n \n \n \n \"In Gan Eden (heaven) there is one hall; it is called the 'hall of the sick' (ill). When the Messiah goes into this hall, he calls all the sicknesses, all the pains, and all the sufferings of Israel that they should come upon him. If he wouldn't take them off Israel and put them on himself no man would be able to bear the sufferings of Israel, as it say 'our sicknesses he bore'. And just like that is Rabbi Eluzer in the Land. Because there is no measure to the sufferings that come upon a man every day, and they all came to the world when the Torah was given. When Israel was in the Holy Land those services and the sacrifices that they did took up from them all the sicknesses and sufferings of the world. Now Messiah takes them from the world, until a man leaves the world and receives his punishments. As it says 'if his sins are more he is taken to Gehennim (hell) to the lowest of the levels and he receives there many punishments because of the greatness of the 'filth' that is on his soul. Then they light the fire greater to burn this 'filth'.\"\n \n \n \n From here we see a few points:\n \n \n \n 1. There are holy people in this world who suffer for G-d's sake.\n \n 2. There is nothing there about a servant dying as Christian theology would demand.\n \n 3. The sufferings from the Messiah are to remove two types of sufferings:\n \n a. Those for the communal sins, while the individual sins do not disappear but wait for their punishment when he dies.\n \n b. The suffering of the Holy ones in this world, who suffer for G-d's sake without sin.\n \n 4. It is associated with the sacrifices (just as in the payyut).\n \n 5. There is no difference between the suffering of the Messiah's soul waiting to enter this world and any other righteous person. Both fulfill the same function with this respect.\n \n \n \n So the Zohar is teaching us the purpose of the suffering of the righteous, including the Messiah's soul awaiting his entry to this world. The payyut is to said to remind the people, on this holiest of days, that the exile and the loss of the temple is only because they have not done the proper repentance for their sins and the sins of their fathers. But should they do it on this day, the Messiah will come, and the Temple be restored. This is in fact what the Prophet says in Hoshea 3:4-5:\n \n \n \n 4 For the children of Israel shall sit solitary many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim;\n \n \n \n 5 afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall come trembling unto the LORD and to His goodness in the end of days.\n Copyright \u00a9 2003, Moshe Shulman for http://www.MessiahTruth.com.

   "Immaculate Conception can be found in The old testiment description of the Ark of The Covenant, where the word of God resided... a forshadowing of the New Ark of the Covenant which is Mary where the Word of God incarnate Jesus Christ resided.\n \n Marys Role as Co-Redemptrix. Simply understood as Mary's Fiat Luke 1:38 \"I am the Lord's servant,\" Mary answered. \"May it be to me as you have said.\" Then the angel left her. Lets face it by Marys \"Yes Ok\" it includes her in Gods plan for mankinds redemption making her a Co-Redemptrix, not to the same level as Christ no catholic believes that but never the less she had her role to play, making her in some small but significant way a co redemptrix\n \n\n \n There are some real problems with your thinking on this. Not your view of the Ark of the Covenant as a 'foreshadowing' of Mary carrying Christ in her womb, but that you use it alone to argue a very central doctrine of Catholicism. You are using a metaphor to back up a doctrine, and I think that's the first time I've ever seen anyone do that regarding something so central to their faith. With that approach, I could justify the belief in the ressurection of Christ by something so simple as Noah exiting his ark after being stuck there, or Jonah being spit out from the fish after 3 days. There are both common metaphors for ressurection in Christian thinking. And the Ark of the Covenenant may very well be a metaphor (\"forshadowing\") for Mary, but we don't typically use such instances as the entire backing for such doctrines. It would be entirely different if somewhere in the Bible it declared Mary as coredemtrix or if Christ had declared it. But such is not the case. I'm inclined to wonder if Catholicism has something more substantial to back up their veneration of Mary than this! Because that's a pretty weak basis. And the other scripture references from Luke don't address Mary being a coredemtrix at all. How does being \"blessed\" or \"finding favor with God\" rise to that?\n \n \nThats the hard one out the way.\n\n \n And yet in being the one that's harder to justify, it's one of the most central aspects of Catholicism.\n \n \nVeneration of Saints\n\n \n I don't have as much a problem with veneration of saints. \n \n \npurgotory. Mt 5:48, Heb 12:14, Jam 3:2, Rev 21:27, 1 Jn 5: 16-17, Jam 1: 14-15, 2 Sam 12:13-14, Mt 5:26, Mt 12:32, 2 Macc 12: 44-46 (not in protestant biblie), 1 Cor 3:15, 1 Pet 3:18-20 & 4:6, 2 Tim 1:16-18, 1 Cor 15:29-30\n\n \n I'm sorry, but there's just nothing there indicating the existence of purgatory. There's plenty in the Bible to indicate the existence of heaven and hell. But you're only pointing to verses that talk about the need to perfection and so forth here in justify belief in purgatory. I just don't get it. Now I didn't read the Maccabees verses because I don't have a copy of those scriptures. I can at least understand why you'd believe in it IF it's laid out clearly there.\n \n \ninfallability of the Pope/churchSpeaking to Peter....\n I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\n\n \n Protestants don't read that in the sense that it applies to not only Peter but all future leaders of the church as well. They read it from the standpoint that Peter was who got the work of the church started. I'll grant you that your evidence for this is weighter than things like purgatory and Mary as co-redemtrix, but I see it no more weighty than the protestant position.\n \n \nThe Canon of OT scripture used by Christ and the apostles was called the septuigent.\n\n \n Yes, I am very much aware of the Septuagint and it's significance. (and it's problems!)\n \n Jewish Rabbi's held a counil in Jamnia in pallistine circa 100AD in reaction to the Christian Church. These Jewish rabbi's removed seven of the books from the hebrew canon that are found in the Spetuigent 1. Wisdom, 2. Sirach, 3. Judith, 4. Baruch, 5. Tobit 6. First Maccabees and 7. second Maccabees as well as portions of daniel and Esther. The Early Christian community continued to use the septuigent and when the church decided the canon of the bible it was the septuigent that would be the OT canon of the Bible and so it remained for over 1000 years until Luther removed them[/quote]\n \n Luther didn't remove them on his own. A lot of thought and consideration went into this. There is also evidence that the early Christian community didn't consider these books as important as others--Origen for instance, speaks of some books as disputed. This fact was a lot of why the Reformers believed it was important to stick to the less spurrilous books.\n \n \nEverything that we have today including the NT comes from the early Church fathers, those who walked and talked with Jesus. The NT itself was not biblical, it was the church who decided it was biblicall, the whole of the NT gets its biblical authority form the Church.\n\n \n Er, the NT IS the Bible. See that's the biggest difference here--you say the BIble gets it's authority from the church, and I say the church gets it's authority from the Bible (the words of Christ). Considering you just pointed out above it was Jesus that commissioned the church, I'd say there's more weight for my position on this.\n \n \nYou see there are plenty of Catholic doctrines that are not biblically based, the reason for this is because Christ didnt Give the authority to Scripture \"sola scriptura\" but to his apostles, now John makes it quite clear that not everything Jesus said or did or even taught are in the bible but that the bible was writen only so that we can have faith, St Paul uses a teaching of Christ in Acts (20:35) that is nowhere to be found in the gospels. However I do not know of one doctrine of the Catholic Church that is not biblically supported.\n\n \n The scriptures don't have authority because they are scriptures; they have them because they are the words of God. How can you not give weight to Jesus' statements in the Gospels? In fact you do, ironically, (by using the Bible in arguements above) so you refute your own believe against sola scriptura. Your argument is now that these doctrines are doctrines because the church says so! That's fine, but some of them are not Biblical. And protestants believe Christianity should be based on the Bible.\n \n \nJesus Wrote nothing !\n\n \n That's not the issue; he DID say things. The question is did He say things important? And the answer is yes. We have thouse words, and that's why His words are more imporatant than the Church's words.",

   "Jyoshu,\n \n It should be a big deal. What power and grace would be present in such an intimate communion with our Lord and Savior in this way??\n\n \n It's not--the power and grace comes from Christ's atoning death of the cross which was an act of love. It doesn't come from eating a wafer and wine. These are acts of remebrance that point to HIS sacrifice. A person could be a Christian under the atonement, and never take eucharist his or her whole life, and atonement would not be in question. There's just nothing Biblical to indicate that the act of taking eucharist brings about atonement.\n \n \nIt is dangerous to adhere to sola scriptura because you end up rejecting parts of Christianity that have been there from the beginning but which you cannot see due to a new interpretation of scripture and a lack of adherence to Holy Tradition.\n\n \n If they aren't Biblical, then there's greater danger than if they are. Those dangers have been realized and played out in the Catholic church down through the centuries. It is because of those very problems that the Reformation became necessary. When you have a view of Christianity that allows it to be changed on the fly throughout history because of a Pope's infallibility, you run into problems. And that's what happened. Maybe sola scripture can be \"dangerous\", but a lack thereof is even more dangerous, IMO, as evidenced by the atrocities and problems Catholicism experienced down through the centuries putting so much power in the hands of one man as opposed to that one man or the church itself being under the authority of God's Word.\n \n \nThe Word of God is not limited to the pages of the Bible, the Word was made flesh and he will be with us until the end of time. The Word is a living, organic Word conveyed fully by the Church (Ephesians 3:10, 1 Timothy 3:15).\n\n \n So you can add Books to the Bible anytime you want? That's the logic of your statements. Do you not see the problems with that?\n \n \nThe Church Fathers believed in the Real Presence of the Eucharist as taught by the Catholic Church\n\n \n Yes, many of them did. The church fathers however, were not Christ. They were only men, just like you and I. They were fallible. They were wrong on this, I believe. One of the things you finid in their writings (particularly the Didache) was that they made a big issue of pointing Christ as authority, not themselves. So I believe the church fathers themselves agree with me that they are not the authority on these matters, and were in fact fallible.",

   "You are using a metaphor to back up a doctrine, and I think that's the first time I've ever seen anyone do that regarding something so central to their faith.\n\n \n Whats wrong with docrtines metphorically speaking?\n \n \nWith that approach, I could justify the belief in the ressurection of Christ by something so simple as Noah exiting his ark after being stuck there, or Jonah being spit out from the fish after 3 days.\n\n \n exactly\n \n \"A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. \"\n \n \n \nthe Ark of the Covenenant may very well be a metaphor (\"forshadowing\") for Mary, but we don't typically use such instances as the entire backing for such doctrines. \n\n \n \n why not?\n \n By Catholic understanding it is. \n \n And to tell you the truth I can see why it is!\n \n \nIt would be entirely different if somewhere in the Bible it declared Mary as coredemtrix or if Christ had declared it.\n\n \n It is decalred in the bible not directly but comon sense prevails Mary had a role to play in the redemption of Mankind....however small that maybe... its still means she is a co redemptrix anyone who disputes otherwise is absolutly and biblically wrong! Marys role as a co redemptrix can not be bibilically opposed or refuted!\n \n \n \nI'm inclined to wonder if Catholicism has something more substantial to back up their veneration of Mary than this! \n\n \n Lots of things are done for us, or given to us, which are not Christ Himself - such as the Bible. Christ is our great & All-sufficient High Priest - His offering is all-sufficient & ever-perfect. Our prayers are not; we are sinners; we fall constantly - yet He commands us to pray, even teaching us how to. Yet how needless that is - for surely He, Who is God, & is the Father's Beloved Son in Whom He delights, knows the Will of His Father perfectly. So it would make sense if only He, but never we, prayed to His Father. We are utterly unqualified to do so - yet it is our privilege, even our duty, to do so. \n \n Again, why are sinful, unholy, unclean, frail, ignorant, blind men made the ministers of the Gospel ? How foolish this seems - for the Holy Spirit could in an instant convert all nations to Himself by His Almighty & All-gracious convincing Power, without perverting or distorting or weakening the Gospel as we so easily & so readily do. Yet that is what God does - He takes a roundabout route (or what looks like one) to do His works. \n \n And so on - the same applies to the Bible, to the Church, to the sacraments, etc. And it is in this context, I think, that the BVM & the Church on earth's attitude & practice regarding her can be seen. Devotion to her is not something isolated - it is part of a much larger pattern, perhaps of several patterns. In the present pattern she is an example of a created means & being which God does not in principle need at all (God needs no creatures at all - none of us), but through which He is pleased to work none the less \n \n Why does God work through creatures ? ISTM, that He does so in order to honour His Son. Everything created - & the NT says this - everything created, exists through & for Jesus Christ. To this there are no exceptions of any kind whatever. If ever there was a rock-solid certain fact, it is this - every thing that has existed, does exist, will, or could or can or may or might exist, does so to the Glory & Honour of Jesus Christ. There is no other reason for anything to exist at all; that includes every other. \n \n And this includes all in the Church - all the saints on earth, & in heaven; so it includes Mary. Mary exists for no other purpose than to bring glory to Jesus Christ. And the NT shows us how she did so. \n \n And she is not suffered to be idle - the saints do not loll at ease, doing nothing, like Sybarites. They love in Heaven far more perfectly than they did on earth, for they see God face to face, as He is. And love is not idle, nor selfish, nor self-absorbed, but it is fruitful in good works, & pours itself out for the benefit of others, & is readier to seek the good of others than they are to ask for good things. \n \n This is at least a part of the love of the Saints in heaven for those who are not yet \"made perfect\" - & it comes from no source but God. Nothing in any creature, not Mary, not the holiest of angels or the least molecule, could exist or remain in being without God: the Providence of God in universal, & ever-active. And His activity is exercised through His saints in Heaven, every bit as truly as through those on earth. \n \n BTW - there is no implication that the work of Christ in His saints in any way makes Him remote from us - Mary is not an obstacle we must negotiate in order to come to Him, any more than the Bible is; no Saint is - we are united with the Saints in Heaven by the Spirit of Christ, Who gives Christ's Life to His Body. And no one ever thought the Holy Spirit was an obstacle to Christ. And as the Bible is not, why must Mary or any other Saint be ? Those whom He has renewed are not obstacles to Christ, because they are \"in\" Christ - & so are we on earth. That's one reason of several that death does not divide us - quite apart from the fact that He has abolished it, His Love is stronger than death. \n \n The acts of Christ are the acts of God - & the acts of God are acts of mighty power, wholly good, excellent in every way, acts which never fail to have their effects. This being so, the saving work of God on the Cross is is a work which has effects. It is a mighty work, a work of omnipotent power, and it it has effects on behalf of those whom He redeems. And the Blessed in Heaven are among those redeemed, they are among the \"redeemed of the LORD\" indicated in the OT. And what is true of them as a group, is true of them as individuals - of whom Mary is one. They are some of the trophies won by Christ, the proofs of His victory. \n \n It is in the knowledge of these things, & other ones, that the Church recommends love & veneration of the Blessed in Heaven, & especially of Mary, the Mother of God. All these arguments come from the NT - none of them in any way subtracts anything from the Unique & Infinite Dignity of Jesus Christ: it would be appalling if anything were to do that. \n \n \n \nyet in being the one that's harder to justify, it's one of the most central aspects of Catholicism\n\n \n Catholicism doesnt try to be easy or straight forward, it dosnt try to apeal to our level of understanding it in turn calls us to a deeper understanding than we ourselves possess.\n \n \n\n I'm sorry, but there's just nothing there indicating the existence of purgatory. There's plenty in the Bible to indicate the existence of heaven and hell. But you're only pointing to verses that talk about the need to perfection and so forth here in justify belief in purgatory. I just don't get it. Now I didn't read the Maccabees verses because I don't have a copy of those scriptures. I can at least understand why you'd believe in it IF it's laid out clearly there.\n\n \n Ok here is a clear outline... read as one!\n \n Mt 5:48, be perfect as yor heavenly father is perfect\n \n Heb 12:14, strive for holiness without which you can not see god\n \n Jam 3:2, We all fall short in many respects\n \n Rev 21:27 Nothing unclean shall enter heaven\n \n 1 Jn 5: 16-17, Degrees of sin distinguished\n \n Jam 1: 14-15, when sin reaches maturity it give birth to death\n \n 2 Sam 12:13-14, David although forgiven is still punished for his sin.\n \n Mt 5:26, You will not be released until you have apid the last penny\n \n Mt 12:32, Sin against holy spirit not forgiven in this age or the next\n \n 2 Macc 12: 44-46 (not in protestant biblie), atone for dead to free them from sin\n \n 1 Cor 3:15, sufffer loss but saved as through fire\n \n 1 Pet 3:18-20 & 4:6, Jesus preached to spirits in prison\n \n 2 Tim 1:16-18, Paul prays for dead friend\n \n 1 Cor 15:29-30 Paul mentions baptising for the dead.\n \n \nProtestants don't read that in the sense that it applies to not only Peter but all future leaders of the church as well.\n\n \n As do catholics all popes are leaders of the church as well as all future popes!\n \n \nLuther didn't remove them on his own.

A religion with a mother goddess and a host of little godlets to take care of local agrarian concerns would have sat a lot more easily with such cultures than a stern male monotheism.\n Finding OT 'justifications' for Mary's elevation wouldn't have been difficult: the OT contains such a wealth of incident and myth that you'd be bound to find something you could turn into an analogy, if you were prepared to stretch metaphor far enough.\n\n Isn't it interesting that the Catholic Church is often accused of elevating a woman to a Goddess equal with Jesus and at the same time of misogyny.\n \n \n \nEasyrider\n FYI, Mary calls God her \"Savior\" and refers to herself as a humble servant (Luke 1:46-47).

   "More interesting still that you think these are incompatible. Elevating one mythical woman to a state of perfection identified with perpetual virginity provides an excellent basis for casting all other women as soiled and impure by comparison.\n\n Actually it does the exact opposite of what you say. It tells all of us, who are humans--even the \"least of these\", the downcast, that we can do good and be good. It tells us that if we do as Mary did, if we follow God with all of our heart and mind, then we can be perfect. It tells us that we can be related to the Divine in a very intimate way even though we are not yet divine. Mary shows us our normal state--one of goodness and perfection--instead of our abnormal state--one affected by sin. She shows us our original humanity.\n \n I refer you to the article from the other thread I started on universal human rights--\"Godless Morality? Why Judeo-Christianity Is Necessary for Human Rights,\" By Edward Feser. Christian teaching tells us the exact opposite of what you assert.\n \n \" The social and political consequences of this lofty vision of human beings' place in the cosmic scheme of things were dramatic. The shabby treatment afforded the poor, the crippled and diseased, and the otherwise powerless in pre-Christian pagan societies was no longer considered morally tolerable. The Roman practices of gladiatorial combat, infanticide, and infant abandonment were abolished, as was abortion. The sexual act was no longer to be treated as a means by which a man might exert his dominance over women and other men (and, now and then, perhaps pro-create, too), but was elevated to the status of a physical manifestation of a marital love mirroring that of Christ for His Church. Fornication and adultery were prohibited for men no less than for women, and divorce and polygamy were condemned as incompatible with respect for the dignity of marriage. \n \n For these and other reasons, the status of women improved immeasurably. Wives could no longer be regarded as the property of their husbands, or as mere breeding machines or instruments for personal pleasure. A man was now expected to find release for his sexual appetites only under the condition that he bind himself to one woman for life, forsaking all others and undertaking not only to provide for her and for every child that might be born as a result of their union, but to love and sacrifice for her as Christ had for him. \n \n Feminists who somehow see in this a paradigm of sexist oppression fail to realize how vastly superior it was historically to the status of women in every culture outside the Judeo-Christian tradition. Indeed, the improvements that have occurred in such cultures-the abolition of sati (the practice of a widow immolating herself on her husband's funeral pyre), foot binding, and clitoridectomy, for instance-have typically come about precisely as a result of the influence of that tradition. And as Alvin Schmidt documents at length in Under the Influence: How Christianity Transformed Civilization , the Judeo-Christian tradition is the direct source of all of the moral reforms concerning the treatment of the individual-such as the abolition of slavery-that modern Westerners take for granted, and that have spread from the West to much of the rest of the world.\"",

That's the problem I have. I'm not arguing against ANY tradition, I'm arguing against elevating over scripture or making it equal to it\n\n The Bible IS a HOLY TRADITION. It is a Tradition of the Catholic Church. You continue to avoid my question. Do you believe Scripture is infallible? Do you believe the Canon of Scripture is infallible? That is, is there anything lacking in Scripture? Are there any books that you would add to the Bible? Are there any that you would take away like Martin Luther? Or do you accept your Bible as complete and authoritative as the inspired Word of God without corruption? \n \n Do you believe that the New Testament is the Divinely Inspired Word of God? If so, then do you acknowledge that the Catholic Church codified these Divinely Inspired books?...not that the Church mandated which were inspired but that it recognized the ones that were truly inspired and discarded others (gnostic gospels, etc.) that were not inspired.\n \n That is, was the Catholic Church sound until the year 397 when the Canon of the Bible was established? (The canon of the Bible was set at the Council of Carthage in 397 with the guidance of St. Augustine (based on the decress of the Coucil of Hippo in 393). This canon was reaffirmed at the second Council of Carthage in 419. This is the Bible that we have today(although other collections of scripture did exist previously)--Protestants and Catholics alike have the same New Testament. \n \n If the Church was sound until then, you have a problem, in that the practices and teachings establishing the Real Presence in the Eucharist, the Sacrifice of the Mass, the Priesthood, Confession, Infant Baptism, the transforming nature of Baptism, etc. were all established prior to that 397 date. Do you conform to those teachings of the Church?\n \n If you don't believe the Church was sounduntil that date of 397 then you also have a problem. How can you trust that it has given you the correct New Testament? Are you willing to change your New Testament now? Is the New Testament you have, in fact, God Breathed, Divinely Interpreted scripture? How was the Catholic Church able to know this if it was corrupt and leading everyone astray?\n \n How can you accept the authority of the Church to determine which writings are Divinely Inspired, which books make up your Bible yet not accept its interpretation of Scripture and other teachings it puts forth??\n \n More puzzling questions about sola scriptura:\n \n 1. Furthermore, how is it that 33,000 Protestant denominations exist if all are reading scripture and being led by the Holy Spirit? Where is the unity that was spoken of in John 17?\n \n 2. If sola scriptura is the method that should be followed then were a lot of Christians helpless and unable to gain knowledge of God and salvation in the early days? One must consider that the canon of scripture that we all have today was not definitively established until 397 A.D. at the Council of Carthage. There were scripture writings and these writings were read at worship services but there was not a collected work in the form of the Bible. One must also consider that the Bible, once established, was very expensive to obtain because it had to be handwritten. One bible took years to complete, was written on very expensive vellum or parchment, and could cost a year's wages. No one could afford one. Most of the world was illiterate anyway. How was the everyday \"layman\" going to read the Bible with the guidance of the Spirit since the majority of them were illiterate? The people did not have access to the Bible until around the mid 1400s when the printing press was invented. So how are all of the masses to live by the \"Word\" and to obtain their salvation through the teachings of the Bible if 1. There was no bible for almost 400 years after Christ 2. There were no copies of the Bible readily available for 1500 years after Christ 3. If Bibles were available the people were illiterate and couldn't read them? There is only one way to learn Christ's teachings and God's word-through the Church! (Ephesians 3:10)\n \n 3. Going back to our dispute on the Real Presence of the Eucharist versus symbolism and the meaning of John 6...How does a sola scriptura Christian come up with the symbolic meaning instead of the literal meaning. It seems that there are obviously at least two choices (although one is right and the other wrong). Therefore the Bible can't decide of itself which of its possible meanings are the truth and what was the teaching from the beginning. So some authority--some minister or other authority--entered at some point on the sola scriptura Christian scene and said this is the interpretation we believe and it differs from the interpretation of all Christian history prior to this point. That minister became the authority and at that point sola scriptura falls. And it has fallen so many times with 33,000 protestant denominations out there teaching conflicting sola scriptura doctrines which are really their own traditions.\n \n 4. Leaving out Catholic and Orthodox views altogether...What happens when you have a conflicting view with someone who professes he is a sola scriptura Christian from a different bible-based church then yours yet a \"bible-based\" church nonetheless? How do you resolve the issue? How does the Holy Spirit guide you both when he was already guiding you both? And why did Jesus say take it to the Church in Matthew 18?",

She likewise believes these things just as if she had but one soul and one and the same heart; and harmoniously she proclaims them and teaches them and hands them down, as if she possessed but one mouth. For, while the languages of the world are diverse, nevertheless, the authority of the tradition is one and the same\" (Against Heresies 1:10:2 [A.D. 189]). \n \n \"That is why it is surely necessary to avoid them [heretics], while cherishing with the utmost diligence the things pertaining to the Church, and to lay hold of the tradition of truth. . . .

   "\"To be deep in history is to cease to be a Protestant.\"\n\n \n This isn't true. Our church embraces the church fathers, be were are definitely protestant. The reformation was a return to the church fathers because the Roman Catholic church had slowly moved away over time from the way they did Christianity. That's not to say that protestantism in all it's forms today maintain any sort of 'pure' form of Christianity. But Luther was reacting against the church having gone astray.\n \n \nAre you telling me that the Bible in the sense of the \"Word of God\" can be transmitted orally or written? (sounds like you believe in Tradition) \n\n \n Of course!! And no, that's not tradition in the sense that Catholics think of it. If I tell the story, as best I can word for word about Christ healing the 10 lepers, I am orally transmitting the Word of God. In that case it's not sitting on paper. \n \n What you don't seem to understand is that the church fathers drew a distinction between tradition and scripture. They considered scripture HIGHER than tradition. That's not to say that extra-Biblical tradition is bad necessarily; it just means that it should not occupy a place equal to or higher than scripture.\n \n \nIf the Word of God is transmitted orally and is Apostolic Transmission then how can this oral Word of God be less authoritative than the written Word of God?\n \n And if the Word of God was transmitted orally and written, then to whom did Jesus give the task of carrying on this transmission? Historically, what entity did Jesus found to carry on this task?\n\n \n The oral Word of God is not extra-Biblical. I'm talking only about the extra-Biblical traditions.\n \n \nIf the Word of God can be transmitted written or orally than how do you know that indulgences, celibacy, and praying through the saints to God is not part of the Word of God? \n\n \n Well be careful here--we're talking about compulsory celibacy, not celibacy in and of itself. To answer your questions, because these we know that these concepts were added later. They don't appear in the early church writings. (Celibacy did as a ideal, but there's no evidence of forcing those who want to be a priest to be celibate. We know for a fact that the man you consider to be your first Pope--Peter--was married, as were other numerous popes.)\n \n \n(I must clarify the misrepresentations you make of Catholic teaching--the Catholic Church does not teach selling indulgences but does teach the validity of indulgences, it does not force celibacy on anyone but celibacy is freely chosen by many who serve as it was chosen by Jesus and Paul)\n\n \n If someone wants to be a RC priest, they have to be celibate. You know this. It's wrong to not allow priests to have the joys of marriage.\n \n \nPerhaps I have not been listening to what you were saying. I thought sola scriptura meant \"bible only.\" \n\n \n That doesn't mean there should be NO tradition. It means scripture ONLY in terms of what is considered authoritative.\n \n \nDo you know of the heresies of the early times of Christianity? Gnosticism, Nestorianism, Monophysitism, Sabellianism, Arianism, etc. Did these have the same access to the Word of God as others? And what did they do with it? They distorted it. And what entity protected the truth from distortion? The Catholic Church. An authority is necessary. Apostolic Tradition is a fact. Tradition, Scripture, and the teaching authority of the Church...all are necessary or the truth is sacrificed. History tells us so.\n\n \n But the church didn't deal with those heresies by using extra-Biblical tradition, they used them by being true to the Word of God--the scripture. They put together the creeds which weren't about traditions but were essentially a compilation of truths from the Word of God (not extra-Biblical tradition). They fought the distortion of the scriptures WITH the scriptures. Notice the Apostle's Creed says nothing about Mary as a co-redemtrix or about compulsory celibacy. It only covers truths about God the Father, God the Son, (born of the virgin Mary) the Holy Spirit, and the church. Notice the Nicene Creed also says nothing about Mary as co-redemptrix or praying through the saints. The creeds are Biblical matters, not matters pertaining to extra-Biblical tradition. So that should be clear to you that they elevated the scriptures ABOVE their extra-Biblical traditions. So when you put extra-Biblical tradition alongside or above scripture, you are moving AWAY from the way the early church did things. That's why many people consider the Reformation a return to the church fathers, to some extent.",

   "Celibacy is a calling in itself, distinct from the calling to the priesthood. Priests were clearly permitted to marry in the early church, as Paul makes clear, when he stipulates that church leaders should only be married once. Celibacy did not become compulsory until mediaeval times, and had more to do with priests trying to pass church lands to their children than any theological consideration. There is nothing wrong with celibacy, and some are called to it, but not all those who are called to the priesthood are called to celibacy. God calls those whom he wishes to carry out his work, be they celibate or married, male or female, gay or straight.\n\n Paul stating that church leaders be married only once does not mean that celibacy was not a tenet of the Church for all of the clerics. It is believed by many, and there is evidence for it as discussed in the article and other books, that Peter and the others who were married were continent within marriage. That is, once they took holy orders they no longer engaged in sex with their spouses. If this is the case, then it might also be that those taking holy orders when single might not be permitted to marry as it is in the Orthodox Church.\n \n Celibacy was \"compulsory\" prior to medieval times.",

   "This isn't true. Our church embraces the church fathers, be were are definitely protestant. The reformation was a return to the church fathers because the Roman Catholic church had slowly moved away over time from the way they did Christianity. That's not to say that protestantism in all it's forms today maintain any sort of 'pure' form of Christianity. But Luther was reacting against the church having gone astray.\n\n It is true that history destroys Protestantism. If one knows history and scripture then one knows that Jesus established a visible, earthly Church to guide his flock once he ascended (Matthew 16:18 and Isaiah 22:15-25)--The Catholic Church. Furthermore, he GUARANTEED that this Church COULD NOT fail in its teaching on faith and morals in Matthew 16:19 when he stated that \"the gates of hell (powers of death) shall not prevail against it.\" This guarantee of the truth, unity, wisdom, and faithfulness of his Church is evident when one reads Matthew 7:24 . Jesus was a wise man and would not build his house on sand but on a lasting rock foundation. Do you think Jesus built his house on sand????? \n \n When exploring Christianity one should ask himself/herself the following questions:\n \n 1. Did Jesus found a visible church on earth? IF so, which one? Yes, the Catholic Church-Matthew 16:18, Matthew 18:17\n \n 2. Did the church have the authority of Jesus? Yes--Matthew 18:17 and 18:18, Matthew 28:18-20, John 20:23, Luke 10:16 \n \n 3. If Jesus established a church and gave it his authority would he let it fall away so soon? No-Matthew 7: 24-27, Matthew 28:20, John 16:13, 1 Timothy 3:15, Ephesians 3:10 (This does not mean that some aspects of the Church or members of the Church did not need reformation. But the Church maintained the revelation of Christ in its fullness unblemished--it did not fall away from the teachings of Christ. A reformation implies a return to form--not a revolution in which an entirely different church is formed).\n \n 4.Would the church Jesus founded be unified, of one mind and one spirit? Or splintered? Unified--John 10:16, John 17:17-23, Ephesians 4:3-6, Philippians 2:2, Romans 12:5\n \n 5. Lastly, if Jesus established a church and you can identify it, as a Christian, should you be a member of it? Should you be willing to follow its teachings knowing that they are the teachings of Christ following from his authority and establishment????\n \n Couple the above with the fact that it was the Catholic Church who preserved true Christianity from all of the heresies of the time and you will see that if the Catholic Church fell then all of Christianity falls with it.\n \n \nBut Luther was reacting against the church having gone astray...\n \n Of course!! And no, that's not tradition in the sense that Catholics think of it. If I tell the story, as best I can word for word about Christ healing the 10 lepers, I am orally transmitting the Word of God. In that case it's not sitting on paper. \n \n What you don't seem to understand is that the church fathers drew a distinction between tradition and scripture. They considered scripture HIGHER than tradition. That's not to say that extra-Biblical tradition is bad necessarily; it just means that it should not occupy a place equal to or higher than scripture.\n \n The oral Word of God is not extra-Biblical. I'm talking only about the extra-Biblical traditions.\n \n ...So that should be clear to you that they elevated the scriptures ABOVE their extra-Biblical traditions. So when you put extra-Biblical tradition alongside or above scripture, you are moving AWAY from the way the early church did things. That's why many people consider the Reformation a return to the church fathers, to some extent\n\n IF ONLY Protestants remembered what they used to believe. IF ONLY Protestants remembered what Luther believed. Even the Lutherans don't remember. I know because my wife is an ELCA Lutheran. \n \n If the Reformation was a return to the early Church then you remain in a problematic situation. Much of what Luther did was a total deformation of sound theology for 1500 years...sola fide and sola scriptura for instance. But much of what he believed was very Catholic. \n \n The modern Lutherans are very liturgical for one example. Their service is much like a Catholic Mass although it is not one. Much of what they say in their service are the exact same words as the Mass. They say the Nicene Creeds. They have the same exact readings as the Catholics on most Sundays--they have adopted our lectionary (and I think the Methodists have also). Of course, they do err in celebrating their communion only once a month. But the Lutherans aren't much like many of the Bible/Fundamentalist churches in their services of the Word. I'm not sure which type of Protestant you are.\n \n You say that Luther returned to the Fathers and the early church? We have already seen that you don't believe many of the Fathers' teachings on the Eucharist, the Sacrifice of the Mass, the Priesthood, Confession, Infant Baptism, the transforming nature of Baptism. Strikingly, Luther believed many of the teachings of the early Church:\n \n Luther himself believed in private confession and practiced it. Check out this website on Luther and confession. I found it doing an ordinary search so I cannot fully vouch for its accuracy but it can lead you to some sources that you can verify:\n \n http://members.aol.com/SemperRef/private.html \n \n I also believe that Luther's Small Catechism speaks on private confession.\n \n It is a Catholic Tradition that Mary stayed a virgin throughout her life. It is a Christian tradition that has been forgotten by Protestants. Luther and other prominent reformers adhered to the idea of the perpetual virginity of Mary.\n \n Consider that Luther honored her and upheld most, if not all, of Catholic Marian doctrine.Yet why do modern day Lutherans/Protestants not hold to Luther's beliefs on this? \n \n Luther accepted the Perpetual Virginity of Mary:\n \n \"Christ...was the only Son of Mary, and the Virgin Mary bore no children besides Him... \"brothers\" really means \"cousins\" here, for Holy Writ and the Jews always call cousins brothers.\" \n \n \"He, Christ, our Savior was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb...This was without the cooperation of a man, and she remained a virgin after that.\"(Sermons on John, chapters 1-4, 1537-39)\n \n Belief in the Immaculate Conception of Mary although he believed this should not be imposed on all believers:\n \n \"It is a sweet and pious belief that the infusion of Mary's soul was effected without original sin; so that in the very infusion of her soul she was also purified from original sin and adorned with God's gifts, receiving a pure soul infused by God; thus from the first moment she began to live she was free from all sin\" (Sermon: \"On the Day of the Conception of the Mother of God,\" 1527)\n \n \"She is full of grace, proclaimed to be entirely without sin-something exceedingly great. For God's grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil. (Personal {\"Little\"} Prayer Book, 1522)\n \n Other quotes showing Luther's veneration of Mary:\n \n \"The veneration of Mary is inscribed in the very depths of the human heart. (Sermon, September 1, 1522)\n \n [She is the] \"highest woman and the noblest gem in Christianity after Christ...She is nobility, wisdom, and holiness personified. We can never honor her enough. Still honor and praise must be given to her in such a way as to injure neither Christ nor the Scriptures.\" (Sermon, Christmas, 1531)\n \n \"No woman is like you. You are more than Eve or Sarah, blessed above all nobility, wisdom, and sanctity.\" (Sermon, Feast of the Visitation, 1537)\n \n \"It is the consolation and the superabundant goodness of God, that man is able to exult in such a treasure. Mary is his true Mother, Christ is his brother, God is his father. (Sermon, Christmas, 1522)\n \n Quotes of Martin Luther were obtained on Dave Armstrong's website at: \n http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZINDEX.HTM\n \n Luther believed that the Eucharist was more than a symbol:\n A Contemporary Translation of Luther's Small Catechism Study Edition states on page 49 that Holy Communion is \"the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Augsburg Fortress publisher 1994\n \n Lutheranism A Restatement in Question and Answer Form by Martin E. Marty, published by Cathedral Directories states on page 11 that Jesus is really present in the meal and that communion is not simply a memorial or symbol...that the gift of the forgiveness of sins is the primary gift of communion. \n \n Lutherans do not believe in transubstantiation as Catholics do but in con-substantiation. They believe in a \"reformed\" Real Presence. Click here for an explanation of con-substantiation:\n \n http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc03/htm/ii.xx.iii.htm\n \n Martin Luther stated \"There are almost as many sects and beliefs as there are heads; this one will not admit Baptism; that one rejects the Sacrament of the altar; another places another world between the present one and the day of judgment; some teach that Jesus Christ is not God. There is not an individual, however clownish he may be, who does not claim to be inspired by the Holy Ghost, and who does not put forth as prophecies his ravings and dreams.\" \n \n But there is only one truth. There must be unity in the Church as the Creed states. (John 10:16, Ephesians 4:3-6). \n \n \nWell be careful here--we're talking about compulsory celibacy, not celibacy in and of itself. To answer your questions, because these we know that these concepts were added later. They don't appear in the early church writings. (Celibacy did as a ideal, but there's no evidence of forcing those who want to be a priest to be celibate. We know for a fact that the man you consider to be your first Pope--Peter--was married, as were other numerous popes.)\n\n \nIf someone wants to be a RC priest, they have to be celibate. You know this. It's wrong to not allow priests to have the joys of marriage.\n\n Please see my other posts to JoBennett, including the article I linked. There is much evidence that Peter and the other apostles were ceased sexual relations once they were called.\n \n Again, no one is forced to be celibate. All who are celibate do so of their own volition. Celibacy is one of the most powerful signs of the Kingdom of God.The celibate priesthood sacrifices itself and gives itself fully and totally without reservation to the Church. A celibate priest gives one's body and life as Jesus gave us his body and life. This points us to the heavenly marriage of Jesus and his bride, the Church. The priest skips the earthly fulfillment and sign of the marriage of the Lamb in anticipation of the heavenly fulfillment of the marriage of the Lamb and our ultimate fulfillment in our union with God. Remember that scripture says that we will not be given in marriage in heaven as we are here. Why not? Probably because we will be fulfilled by our union with God.\n \n But I will say that the Church has the power to assert compulsory celibacy if it wishes, for it was given the power to bind and loose.\n \n \nThat doesn't mean there should be NO tradition. It means scripture ONLY in terms of what is considered authoritative.\n\n Please see my previous post to you concerning authority. There had to be an authority to establish what were the authentic scriptures and there must be an authority to truthfully interpret scripture. Apostolic Tradition guarantess this authority. This power of authority was given to the Catholic Church by Jesus Christ.\n \n You have yet to prove \"scripture ONLY\" from scripture itself. Many questions on sola scriptura have been left unanswered. I'm not even sure in the first place how I know if your version of sola scriptura is the correct version.\n \n \nBut the church didn't deal with those heresies by using extra-Biblical tradition, they used them by being true to the Word of God--the scripture. They put together the creeds which weren't about traditions but were essentially a compilation of truths from the Word of God (not extra-Biblical tradition). They fought the distortion of the scriptures WITH the scriptures. Notice the Apostle's Creed says nothing about Mary as a co-redemtrix or about compulsory celibacy. It only covers truths about God the Father, God the Son, (born of the virgin Mary) the Holy Spirit, and the church. Notice the Nicene Creed also says nothing about Mary as co-redemptrix or praying through the saints. The creeds are Biblical matters, not matters pertaining to extra-Biblical tradition. \n\n I think JoBennet answered this point well about the fact that all of the heretics had access to the Word and used it to propagate false doctrine. The Catholic Church stood against them. You keep saying extra-biblical, but the Church dealt with those heresies using authority that you also think is extra-biblical, therefore you have abandoned it. Yet I have proven that authority scriptural above. Tradition is intertwined with Scripture. Nothing in Tradition contradicts Scripture, although it may not be explicit in Scripture... as I stated in previous posts. So Tradition may be extra-biblical in the sense that the Trinity is extra-biblical...that is, not stated explicitly in full detail. But Tradition is not extra-biblical in that there is no foundation for it in the Word.\n \n Interesting that you mention the Creed, which was also hammered out in a council of the Catholic Church. The Apostles' Creed states, \"I believe in...the holy catholic church, the communion of saints...\" The Nicene Creed states, \"We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.\" The Nicene Creed was formulated in 325 and the Apostles' Creed before that. Do you believe in the Catholic Church? Does your church fulfill the four marks of the Church stated in the Nicene Creed? It is probably holy and the Spirit probably works within it. But is it united as one? Is it catholic...that is, does it agree with the whole Church and is it universal to be found throughout the farest reaches of the earth? Is it apostolic...does it preserve Apostolic Tradition and can it trace its lineage back through its bishops to the apostles and Jesus?\n \n And before you claim a different meaning of Catholic then read what the early Christians said the word meant prior to its distortion at the Reformation:\n \n \"See that you follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as you would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.\" St. Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrneans 8, A.D. 107\n \n \"[T]here are many other things which most properly can keep me in [the Catholic Church's] bosom. The unanimity of peoples and nations keeps me here. Her authority, inaugurated in miracles, nourished by hope, augmented by love, and confirmed by her age, keeps me here. The succession of priests, from the very see of the apostle Peter, to whom the Lord, after his resurrection, gave the charge of feeding his sheep [John 21:15-17], up to the present episcopate, keeps me here. And last, the very name Catholic, which, not without reason, belongs to this Church alone, in the face of so many heretics, so much so that, although all heretics want to be called 'Catholic,' when a stranger inquires where the Catholic Church meets, none of the heretics would dare to point out his own basilica or house\" St. Augustine Against the Letter of Mani Called \"The Foundation\" 4:5 [A.D. 397] \n \n Is this belief in the Catholic Church a biblical matter of the creed? If so, then where do you stand on it?\n \n I also highlighted the profession of the Apostles' Creed concerning the \"communion of saints.\" That is, of course, our doctrine of praying \"to the saints.\" Again, is this a biblical matter of the creed? If so, then where do you stand? I believe that you have already stated that the creeds were truths put together from the Word of God.\n \n Peace.",

   "It is true that history destroys Protestantism.\n\n \n Maximus, I'm not going to do a sentence-by-sentence response here, because frankly, I don't think this issue is worth the effort.

So when you use those as evidence of Roman Catholicism being the right way, it rings hollow; they are also evidence of my church being the right way. Protestantism CHANGED the church--that doesn't mean protestants are outside the God's children--the Church. That's your exclusivity talking, but it has no Biblical basis. Nor is it a particularly Christ-like position on your part. We're ALL part of the church--as Christians--and we are all part of the 'tradition' that fought the heresies and developed the creeds. When we say the Apostle's Creed in church every Sunday, we mean the word \"catholic\" in the creed under the phrase \"the holy catholic church\" as lower-case \"c\". Like many protestant churches, we view that as meaning the universal church of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm sure you disagree, but that's fine. I'm confident enough about it to not feel the need to defend the matter any more to you. The thing is, I know that not all Roman Catholics think so exclusivist as you do--I have Roman Catholic friends that aren't so intolerant of protestants and have the more Christ-like attitude that we are all God's children and all make up the Church--Protestants and Roman Catholics alike.",

I respect and accept you (and Jo) as a brother (and sister) Christian. So does the Catholic Church. You are part of the Body of Christ and part of the one, holy church. However, you are not fully united with Jesus' One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. Your church and others possess elements of truth but not the fullness of truth that can only be found in the Church Jesus established. \n \n Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) 818 \"However, one cannot charge with the sin of the separation those who at present are born into these communities [that resulted from such separation] and in them are brought up in the faith of Christ, and the Catholic Church accepts them with respect and affection as brothers. . . . All who have been justified by faith in Baptism are incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be called Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers in the Lord by the children of the Catholic Church.\"\n \n CCC 836 \"All men are called to this catholic unity of the People of God. . . . And to it, in different ways, belong or are ordered: the Catholic faithful, others who believe in Christ, and finally all mankind, called by God's grace to salvation.\"\n \n CCC 838 \"The Church knows that she is joined in many ways to the baptized who are honored by the name of Christian, but do not profess the Catholic faith in its entirety or have not preserved unity or communion under the successor of Peter.\" Those \"who believe in Christ and have been properly baptized are put in a certain, although imperfect, communion with the Catholic Church.\" With the Orthodox Churches, this communion is so profound \"that it lacks little to attain the fullness that would permit a common celebration of the Lord's Eucharist.\"\n \n With that said, may we continue to, \"...teach and admonish one another in all wisdom...\" Colossians 3:16 and to \"be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence.\" 1 Peter 3:15\n \n \nAs far as I'm concerned, the RCC is just another denomination that happens to be older than the others. It's certainly a lot different in practice than the primitive church, based on what we read in the NT and earliest writings. The RCC is mostly a product of post-Constantine ideas, much of it developed throughout the middle ages.\n\n The Roman Catholic Church is not a denomination. It is THE CHURCH from which all denominations sprang. Be aware also that the truth is about more than your confidence and concern. I don't mean that in a smart-alec way. I mean that the truth is an objective truth that must be looked at in the light of history, Scripture, Tradition and the Teaching Authority of the Church.\n \n \nSure, protestantism has erred too since Luther, but then the RCC never got all of it right either. We all do the best we can.

The Church it is normatively necessary though not absolutely necessary...meaning that God has bound his Church, though he is not bound by it. This means that salvation can be obtained outside of the Catholic Church but the most appropriate and accurate way to follow the Way, the Truth, and the Life is within Jesus' Church. \n \n The Catholic Church though sinful has never erred in its teaching on faith and morals. It holds to the truth when no one else will--on divorce, artificial contraception, celibacy, male priesthood, fertility technology, etc.\n \n Jesus is the head of the Catholic Church because he founded it. But Jesus left a steward while the King is away, as Matthew 16:18 and Matthew 7:24 read in light of Isaiah 22:15-24 tells us (think of J.R.R. Tolkien's Return of the King). He left an earthly head and shepherd to lead the flock while he is away John 21: 15-19. God always put someone in charge of his people to be his voice and administrator on earth. He always placed a father to lead the household of God-Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, the judges, Saul, David, Solomon...Jesus...then Peter...then the Popes...the fathers of the household. \n \n \nOne other thing--the Church that fought back the heresies and developed the creeds is my Church too.

We are probably most often on the same side. You usually debate well. But on this issue you have not. But it is not I whom you debate.

You failed to respond to these proofs though. You failed to respond to:\n \n 1. the Catholicity of the Fathers (teachings of the Fathers that you said were scriptural then decided they were not when you learned what teachings those were--Real Presence of the Eucharist, a sacramental worship in the Mass, confession, priesthood, etc.--teachings all of which were in effect prior to establishing the canon of your Bible--can you trust that that Church gave you the innerrant Word of God yet failed so miserably in those other teachings????) \n \n 2. the Catholicity of Martin Luther--First Reformer and his beliefs on the Eucharist, confession, Mary\n \n 3. the Catholic scriptural beliefs of the early Church spelled out explicitly in the Creeds\n \n 4. the presence of Tradition in Jesus' Church as evidenced by Catholic practices and the words of Paul\n \n 5. the authority given the church by Jesus and the how and why Jesus would establish his church on a firm foundation and then let it fall away so soon...\n \n You have failed to explain a workable paradigm of sola scriptura including how to determine who is right when two sola scripturas conflict, and how thousands of different churches, doctrines, and practices have come out of this sola scriptura belief.\n \n You may want to read some of these books if you do not trust what I have presented you on the early Church.

Peter Stravinskas:\n http://www.catholicfreeshipping.com/Products/cfs_biandmabyrep.html\n \n The Mass of the Early Christians by Mike Aquilina:\n http://www.amazon.com/Mass-Early-Christians-Mike-Aquilina/dp/0879739428/sr=1-2/qid=1162351789/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/102-0347452-6842524?ie=UTF8&s=books\n \n Four Witnesses: The Early Church in Her Own Words by Rod Bennett:\n http://www.ignatius.com/ViewProduct.aspx?SID=1&Product_ID=691&SKU=FWEC-P&ReturnURL=search.aspx%3f%3fSID%3d1%26SearchCriteria%3dfour+witnesses\n \n One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic: The Early Church Was the Catholic Church by Kenneth D. Whitehead\n http://www.ignatius.com/ViewProduct.aspx?SID=1&Product_ID=268&SKU=OHCA-P&ReturnURL=search.aspx%3f%3fSID%3d1%26SearchCriteria%3dwhitehead\n \n \n So when you use those as evidence of Roman Catholicism being the right way, it rings hollow; they are also evidence of my church being the right way. Protestantism CHANGED the church--that doesn't mean protestants are outside the God's children--the Church. That's your exclusivity talking, but it has no Biblical basis. Nor is it a particularly Christ-like position on your part. We're ALL part of the church--as Christians--and we are all part of the 'tradition' that fought the heresies and developed the creeds. When we say the Apostle's Creed in church every Sunday, we mean the word \"catholic\" in the creed under the phrase \"the holy catholic church\" as lower-case \"c\". Like many protestant churches, we view that as meaning the universal church of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm sure you disagree, but that's fine. I'm confident enough about it to not feel the need to defend the matter any more to you. The thing is, I know that not all Roman Catholics think so exclusivist as you do--I have Roman Catholic friends that aren't so intolerant of protestants and have the more Christ-like attitude that we are all God's children and all make up the Church--Protestants and Roman Catholics alike\n\n Remember that I have a Lutheran wife, so I am not that exclusive. We live in marital harmony. But I tell her the truth about religion in as straightforward a manner as I have told you...through the eyes of the 2,000 year old Church. She shares many Catholic beliefs. Our kids will be raised Catholic.\n \n The Church needed some reform although the belief in Indulgences is valid (not the selling of). The Church did not need a whole new theology to go with that reform of abusive practices. The Church may have needed a reform of some sort. It did not need a revolution. It did not need \"as many sects and beliefs as there were heads.\"\n \n Remember the words of Ignatius and Augustine on the word Catholic. There were no other Christian churches around when the term became a part of the biblical Creeds.\n \n Let us pray that He may \"lead us into all truth.\" Let us pray that He may lead us into the one truth. There must be unity in the Church as the Creed and Scripture states. (John 10:16, Ephesians 4:3-6).\n \n Let us strive for that unity. Peace brother.",
