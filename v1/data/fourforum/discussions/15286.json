Your points are often lost due to the fact that you can't properly structure a sentence, paragraph or an argument. Tossing about insults like \"too stupid\" is not an argument; it&#8217;s the behavior of an ill-behaved school yard bully.\n \n There are brilliant people and stupid people across the board, not to mention we all have our gifts and challenges. Being part of some \"group\" (for the most part) does not define one's abilities, intelligence or character.\n \n Also, I wouldn't look to Rush Limbaugh, Michael Moore or any other blow-hard as an informed source for any opinion. Those guys are entertainers, after attention and a buck, not educators.\n\n I know you are trying to make a point here about the inappropriateness of brutus' behavior but I don't think your justification for why it is wrong is not correct.\n \n From this sentance: \"People come to their opinions through upbringing, religion, education and life experience.\"\n \n Betrays some belief in subjectivism. If people come to their opinions by simply absorbing social cues they aren't thinking for themselves. You cannot claim that disagreements are all caused by different life experiences. This assumes two things that aren't correct about logic. \n 1. That different conclusions about reality can be had from the same reality.\n 2. The same experiences will lead to the same conclusion.\n \n (2.) is an incorrect extrapolation on the fact that the same premises will lead to the same conclusion.\n \n The truth is everyone does 'think' the same in the kind of essential thought that is relevant in epistemology, and objectively incorrect thoughts exist to the degree that logical errors exist.\n \n The reasons Brutus just blindingly chanting 'too stupid' or 'low IQ' is incorrect is because it doesn't support anything, and has no place in debate. The definition of an ad hominem isn't 'very mean' or 'arrogant' it's attacking an opponent's character rather than answering his argument. \n \n \nDon't waste your time, Brutus and Freedom are basically pre-programmed response machines. \n \n Like you say in your post, some people are dumb...well, on that same level, some people aren't thinkers and are \"soldiers\". Brutus and Freedom are clearly the latter and blindly go with what someone else says. I'm not saying that is necessarily a bad thing but it does place a moral responsibility on those of us that DO think to not manipulate the thoughts of people.\n\n Wow, you got cut pretty deeply didn't you? Look it wasn't my decision not to argue it was yours. If you were going to be so bugged by not expressing your reasons you shouldn't have done that.",

Policies that the EU is now attempting to reverse in order to undo the economic damage they have done to themselves as our stupid president is imposing them on us.\n \n So anyone who dares to boast about how smart this jackal of a president is, is only reinforcing for any truly intelligent person how absolutely stupid they are to fall for and defend such failed policies. In other words poet, either Obama is truly as stupid as I'm saying he is or he is knowingly leading America down the road to economic ruin on purpose which means he is a true and unequivocal traitor to the people who elected him with his bogus promises of hope and change.\n\n \n I see you are still in Dream World where you believe in your conspiracy theory about Obama being the Enemy of the U.S. And you have the nerve to call Liberals Stupid?...\n \n Obama May not be doing so well turning the country around but let's not forget he inherited a Destroyed economy and a Republican party who was /is Hell bent on making him look bad. He's done more for this Country in 2 years than Bush did in 8, and with 6 more years we might actually start to see a recovery from the disaster of allowing Conservative XXXXXX to drive the country into a ditch.

The idea revolved around there \"not being enough money\" but for the sack of argument we'll assume that it helps a countries infrastructure which, in turn, helps the economy. \n \n If the US government spent 10000% of GDP in this manner would it help the economy? Or what if we spent that money but our infrastructure was already at maximum benefit? Most people would say this wouldn't help. Keynesian economics just have a point of diminishing returns. This is 100% like the \"supply-side\" guys who think lower taxes will lead to economic growth and more government revenue. Well, at 1% tax rates going down to 0% will benefit no one but at 100% going down to 99% will do just that. \n \n My point is that it isn't proof that Keynesian is correct when you spend money to build an area that was literally leveled after a war.

   "how on earth can liberalism end a depression rather than make it worse??\n\n \n What would you know, All you're interested in is attaching the blame for everything on the Democrats while ignoring the role the republicans played in driving this country into a ditch again. Just like before the Great Depression Hoover decided a huge tax break was what was needed so he reduced the the top income tax rate from 73% down to 24%. Combined with the decline in incomes due to the early depression and the decrease in revenues it led to a serious deficit in the federal budget. \n On top of that he passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs on thousands of imported goods. In retaliation other countries raised tariffs on American goods effectively cutting off trade with other nations and worsening the Depression even further. The Great Depression was started with the Stock Market Crash in 1929 and the policies that Hoover enacted during his term drove the U.S. straight into a ravine.\n Now we move to this century where we are seeing a mirror image of the Past. George W. Destroyed our economy with his failed policies and massive tax cuts but all you repubs want to do is throw all the blame on Obama . When are you going to open YOUR eyes and realize it's not one parties fault. Both parties are responsible. We're about to find out just who knows what they're doing, if the GOP/Teabaggers don't get off their high horse and raise the Debt limit we'll see just how long the GOP will last once the Middle Class takes the worst beating in history because the GOP wants to ignore Math and Facts.",

Big, government owned companies are the main drivers of the economy, investment is directed, competition removed. In America, government interference has taken the form attacking corporations, raising interest rates, increasing taxes on the top levels.

   "Yes the Great Depression was a worldwide event, I didn't suggest otherwise. I also am not saying that the War played no part in the recovery. Historical accounts will pretty much say the War was mostly responsible for the turn around, but I still believe the policies FDR put into place, at least some of them , also played a role. We'll never really know what might have happened if the War had not taken place, but there are those who speculate that the Depression would have ended without the War and there are those say Opposite.\n\n \n It would have ended without the War as well but it certainly made it faster.

   "I\\'d say the New Deal was the Great Depression because the New Deal kept us in Depression. When the government taxes and spends it creates bubbles that burst and prevent recovery. That is how FDR amassed the worst economic record in US history and became a hero to AXX backwards liberals.\nThis wasn\\'t so much the New Deal as it was the government trying to manipulate a correction. Much like today people seem to think the problem was not that we had overvalued all our assets but rather we didn\\'t keep up the farce. Back in the Great Depression we tried to make people\\'s \"values\" go back to what they were but you just have to let things correct themselves. This applies today with the housing market. People think the solution is to have housing prices back to where they were. WRONG. It needs to adjust to a true market value.",
