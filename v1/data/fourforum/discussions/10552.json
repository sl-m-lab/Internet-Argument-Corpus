I hope you got some insurance money. \n \n Let me point out that someone speaking in a rude manner to you is NOT violating your rights. It's just someone speaking in a rude manner. You have had a bad encounter with a particular gay man. That's too bad, but he has not denied you any rights. You can ignore him, or you can respond to him, but you have the same rights that you had before you had your conflict with him. Why generalize to other gay people an experience you have had with one person? \n \n On your scenario regarding transgender people, a transgender person is not the same as a gay person. And again, you really cannot generalize to all transgender people or to gay people from an experience that probably happens very rarely, which is that a transgender person does not reveal that he or she is trans at the outset of a relationship. There are very few transgender people who have had surgery, and even fewer who get into a relationship without revealing that they are trans. Someone deceiving someone in a relationship is not denial of their rights, but it is dishonest.",

We must agree or we are doomed to be the meanest people on earth?! That is violating our rights to form an opinion. A right that is stomped all over by Homosexuals. But they say they want a right to have an opinion, while taking ours away.\n\n \n Of course you have the right to disagree. You don't have the right to not have your opinion/disagreement critisized. Nobody does. You don't agree with them being homosexual and they don't agree with your disagreement. Welcome to the arena of free opinions. Someone thinking you are a meanie is not an infringement of your rights.\n \n \n2. They push their lifestyle on others. \n\n \n How? If you mean they refuse to remain in the closet so you are confortable, well - neither do heterosexuals. Not behaving in a way you personally are comfortable with is not an infringement of your rights.\n \n \n2. I have seen on so many occasions where a woman or a man gets an operation to become a female/male, and gets into a relationship with a heterosexual. Now this person did not know that they were dating someone who had a sex change. They thought that they were dating someone of the opposite sex. And when they finally reveal that they used to be a man/woman, that is after they have been dating the person for a couple of years. That is taking away a persons right to choose whether they want to date a homosexual or not. That is another right that is stomped on. \n\n \n First of all, gender identity and sexual orientation are not the same thing. Most homosexuals do not wish to change their gender. Secondly, there are only about three hospitals that do sex-change operations and they only do so once the person has been through several meetings and counseling sessions and the medical professionals are convinced it is the right thing for the individual. It is also a costly, not generally covered by insurance procedure - so, no, you are not seeing this happen all the time. You may have a seen a couple of sensationalist news articles.\n \n Granted, I agree that if an individual becomes intimate with someone they should be forthcoming and not revealing a little detail like having had a sex-change operation is indicative of a loser. However, people misrepresenting themselves is hardly exclusive domain of trans-gendered or homosexual individuals. Nor, generally, is it an infringement of your rights (there are exceptions here).\n \n \n \n3. This has happened to me on a number of occasions. I did not like a guy, not because he was gay, but because he had a bad attitude. He always rolled his eyes and was a very negative person. But because he was gay he said I didn't like him because of that. So we don't have the right to dislike a homosexual because of their attitude?! I dislike some heterosexuals because of their attitude. And what?! But homosexuals play that victim card too much and its annoying, and its childish. And it encroaches on heterosexuals rights.\n\n \n Sweetie, you can like or dislike whoever you want. If the guy is a jerk, why the hell do you care what he thinks? Learn not to sweat the a-holes and life will be much easier. Someone needlessly playing the victim is indeed annoying - being annoyed is not an infringement of your rights.\n \n \nI'm not slashing at gays. Even though I don't approve of the lifestyle. I just want them to stop violating my rights with their problems. And every other heterosexual.:xbanghead\n\n \n First of all - yes you are. Secondly, you need to get a clear definition of what a \"right\" is. (You could start with the US Constitution and go from there - legal cases, etc.) The rights homosexuals are fighting for are legal - things like equal protection under the law, having their families recognized under the law, being free from discrimination in workplace.\n \n The things you complain about are not rights infringement (except maybe the one about disclosure - but that is not a homosexual-exclusive issue.)\n \n You can say, think, beleive what you want about homosexuals. Just understand that they can say, think and believe what they want about you as well. Welcome to America.",

And they are denying rights when they don't tell the other person they are of the same sex.\n\n \n No, actually. What sex a transgender person dates is entirely variable. Some MTF transgender people date other women, and then they are gay. Other MTF transgender people date men, and they are heterosexual. Some FTM transgender people date other men, and they are gay. other FTM transgender people date women, and they are heterosexual. Gender identity is not the same as sexual orientation, and one does not determine the other. We have quite a few transgender people in our church, and I have learned a lot from them about this topic. \n \n On the question of \"denying rights,\" I usually think of rights as denied by the government, not by individuals, though I suppose you can view individuals as denying other individuals rights. However, I would not classify lying to someone as the same as denying them \"rights.\" I think it's dishonest and in the circumstance you describe it's wrong, but I don't see how this is denying someone \"rights.\" It may simply be that we differ in our use of language about this. Anyway, there are very few transgender people, and the magnitude of this kind of dishonesty doesn't come anywhere close to the numbers of spouses who are dishonest by cheating with another person. It's a miniscule problem relative to other kinds of social problems created by dishonesty.",

WE'RE EVERYWHERE!!emoticon_cool emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n I think you take a very closed-eye view of a very complex issue. I am not sure if you are anti-gay or not, but I think you should try imagining being in the shoes of a gay person (not sexually, but in day-to-day life) before coming out swinging.\n \n To put it simply, if there were 100% equality for gays as well as well as acceptance, then the in-your-face activism would not exist or be needed. But as with any minority group, all these \"discrepencies\" in equality, big and small, start adding up and taking it's toll. For example. I'm civilly partnered to a man here in Germany. I have immigration and work rights here because of our country-recognized partnership. However, he does not have the right to live in the US.... There is a green card lottery that the US does every year. On the application, there are the choices for single, married, divorced. Where do we fit in? Is that fair? I'm only pointing out a rather frivolous example that has an absolutely huge impact on our lives. Activism surfaces when the minority has had enough of these little or big discrepancies in equality. \n \n The fact is, SG, that many gay people are already married in Mass, and civilly partnered elsewhere in the states. Many gays are married in Europe. Many gays are raising families and these children don't have the right to \"married\" parents. There are so many hoops we constantly have to jump through just to get to live our lives. There is a poster on here who is getting health benefits from his partner's job; however, he has to pay a hefty premium. However, if YOU married his partner today, without even meeting him, you'd get the benefits for free. Heck, if YOU married my husband today without even meeting him first, he could be on a plane to the US tommorrow and have full rights to work in the US. These are just a couple of things in a list of over a thousand, let alone discrmination and prejudice we find day after day.\n \n I had a job interview in London on Friday. Even though I am very out of the closet, to this very day I'm still very guarded about telling people I'm gay and married to a man. I'm so damaged by the America prejudices I encountered all too often. It's hard to get around the psychological damage that's been imposed on us by a rather repressed society. My friends in London tell me it's not a big deal and is pretty much part of culure now. It's very much part of German culture now. But many heterosexuals can be pretty nasty to homosexuals, moreso in the US. I remember walking through Greenwich Villiage on the famous gay Christopher Street about 10 years ago holding my then, boyfriends hand. Some Jersey boys started throwing beer bottles at us and yelling all kinds of offensive slurs. How would you feel about that?\n \n I do think your opinions are a little unresearched. You seemed to have strong opinions, but I would challenge you to look from the other side. We are the sum total of all our experiences in life. If we have too many bottles thrown at us, then there will come a time where we say \"enough!\" and throw back. Sometimes innocents get caught in the crossfire. But for many gays, pushing back against an unfair system is the only thing we can do. It forms who we are since we're the ones battling for our place in the world. If some of us come off a bit more harsh than others, well.... perhaps some of the bottles that were thown left some pretty big scars.",

But we are making headway in changing this, despite the recent setbacks in the states.

It's because we have been making headway that the backlash developed. Now, however, people are gradually growing tired of making us the villains, as they see that our having the legal right to marry in Massachsetts and elsewhere has had zero negative effect on anyone or anything.

   "Hello everyone! I'm back after 8 months of being without a computer, because of a fire. And I have something I would like to address.\n \n I'm all for everyone having rights. Why?! Because everyone is human, and should have rights. BUT!!! The one thing that annoys me is why gay people are always talking about no one giving them respect, and no one is fair when it comes to gay rights.\n\n \"always talking about\"?\n There are multiple threads in the \"Gay\" section here.\n How many of them are about actual discrimination, and how many of them are about \"respect\"?\n \n Quite frankly, what annoys me is how some anti-gay people want to MAKE the subject about CLAIMS of not getting respect or acceptance, when that complaint is more hot air than substance.\n \n \n \n1. If we don't agree with their style of living, all of a sudden we are mean people who are just hateful.\n\n 1) I have to laugh at complaints like this, because often they are a lame retort for when somebody ACTUALLY SAYS something that is vile and slanderous, and then they want to obfuscate somebody pointing that out with the above claim.\n I can't tell you how many times I have had people reply complaining about labels of \"bigot\" or \"homophobe\" when I didn't actually use that term in the first place. A while back I did a search and found that for one particular example of a poster (Jyoshu), he complained about the term more often than I actually used it. Moreover, the vast majority of my usages were in response to repeating the word he had used in his complaint. (Not as a label, but just repeating the word in my post.)\n If you have an actual case in point, that would be helpful.\n \n 2) On the flip side, if gays want equal rights, suddenly we are \"anti-family\".\n And quite frankly, I have seen far more examples of that.\n \n \n \n1. Now where is our rights as heterosexuals? We don't have the right to disagree?! We must agree or we are doomed to be the meanest people on earth?! That is violating our rights to form an opinion.\n\n What an absurd position!\n So if a gay person actually speaks out disagreeing with your opinion, and classifying it as they might see fit, that is somehow violating YOUR \"rights\"?\n Hate to break it to you gal, but you don't have ANY right to be free of others voicing an opinion that you don't like. And if that opinion happens to be that they find somebody's statement \"hateful\", that's not a violation of any \"right\" of yours.\n \n \n \n2. They push their lifestyle on others. \n\n Yet another example of heterosexual privilege.\n There are thousands upon millions of examples of public heterosexuality in our society today. Barbie and Ken. Snow White and Prince Charming. Wedding rings. Wedding showers. Seemingly innocuous questions as to \"Do you think that chick is hot?\"\n \n Yet if a gay person demands equal rights, and lives his life in a way that isn't closetted, suddenly that is \"pushing\" his \"lifestyle\" on you.\n \n What it really boils down to is that people like you have a \"NIMBY\" attitude. Gay equality may or may not be a good idea, but you don't want to see it either way.\n \n I ask you to tell me how gays \"push\" their \"lifestyle\" on others in a way that doesn't have an analogous heterosexual example that is not condemned.\n I don't expect any answer, but I'll ask anyways.\n \n \n \n2. I have seen on so many occasions where a woman or a man gets an operation to become a female/male, and gets into a relationship with a heterosexual. Now this person did not know that they were dating someone who had a sex change.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes \n I have seen people exaggerate their experiences, claiming to have \"seen\" things that they never really have.\n What you've seen on Jerry Springer is not \"so many occasions\".\n \n \n \nThat is taking away a persons right to choose whether they want to date a homosexual or not. That is another right that is stomped on. \n\n People should be honest. Period.\n \n \n \n3. This has happened to me on a number of occasions. I did not like a guy, not because he was gay, but because he had a bad attitude.\n\n Probable translation: He wasn't a gay doormat who allowed me to get away with b.s. statements.\n \n \n \nI'm not slashing at gays.\n\n Actually, that is precisely what you are doing.\n You should at least be honest about that.",

Two men practising sodomy is perverted sex and nothing else. Two men 'married' to each other are just two pathetic individuals who realise what they are doing is not normal but that is the best they can do. However two men engaging in sex living together is not marriage, it is just a pathetic travesty.\n Homosexuality is not the norm, homosexuality is abnormal.\n I know it is not your fault, you were born that way and there is nothing you can do about it.

You did not chose what you are, you did not prefere to be what you are; you had no choice you were born homosexuals and you will die homosexuals.

   "Well, you obviously are being disingenuous for gay men are always presenting themselves as victims and demanding rights. Isn't that looking for sympathy?.\n\n \n Nope. Demanding equal rights is in no way looking for sympathy. I have sympathy and pity as well for you though.\n \n \n \nSaying that homosexuality is just a different sexual preference is a blatant attempt to minimise and disguise a perversion.\n\n \n Should I take your word on this rather than every credible psychological association in the world? Based on the ignorance you have spewn thus far, I think I'll go with the professionals. \n \n \nWe are not talking here about preferring vanilla flavoured ice cream to banana flavoured ice cream (although I am sure you gays prefer the latter, so it was a bad example).\n\n \n What a HOOT you are emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nHave you ever asked yourselves why normal people, i.e. heterosexuals people find you XXXXX in the old fashioned meaning of the world?\n\n \n XXXXX, meaning not of the norm describes you to a T. \n \n \nSex is intended for procreation and to procreate you need two individuals of opposite sex.\n\n \n True you need contributions from a member of each sex. However, there is no requirement that the contibutors partake is the rearing of the child. This can be done by two same sex parents just as well if not better. Please make us all a promise that YOU will not procreate, this we do not need, I hope it's not too late. \n \n \nTwo men practising sodomy is perverted sex and nothing else. Two men 'married' to each other are just two pathetic individuals who realise what they are doing is not normal but that is the best they can do. However two men engaging in sex living together is not marriage, it is just a pathetic travesty.\n\n \n It sure is marriage where recognized. This is increasing at a steady pace. You are certainly going to be in the minority with your views if not already. Be prepared to be ostracized. That should be fun. \n \n \nHomosexuality is not the norm, homosexuality is abnormal.\n I know it is not your fault, you were born that way and there is nothing you can do about it. There is no cure for it and I don't think that people ought to be discriminated for desires and instincts they have no control of.\n I don't mind at all what you do behind close doors. But please, don't tell me is normal. You have my sympathy but not my admiration. I am glad I am not one of you.\n\n \n Seeing how it happens in nature without human interference, it is certainly natural. Homosexuality is normal to many, heterosexuality is abnormal to many. However, both are normal in actuality. \n \n \n **************\n \nMae has a sense of humour and she is not an ignorant. Mae is just pointing out that this Forum is dominated by gay issues so it is a gay Forum.\n So yes, she has a point and her postings the same as mine making fun of the issue are a reaction to the stupid nonsensensical fantasy that gays adhere to: that not only are they 'normal' but that the difference between heterosexuals and them is just a matter of personal preferences. You did not chose what you are, you did not prefere to be what you are; you had no choice you were born homosexuals and you will die homosexuals. I am sure every one of you must remember the day in your lives when you realised you were 'different' to the rest. You are abnormal and yes, you are minority.\n\n \n Yes, both of your views are both ignorant (meaning, not educated). No matter how many times you repeat that being gay is abnormal, doesn't make it so. Actually, it has already been determined to be normal and that decision was not made out of ignorance, such as yours and Mae's. \n \n By the way, if you think your getting under the skin of anyone here, your not.

And then, like Winston, trying taking the higher ground, after making yourself a clown--stating that we're not normal. Well, honey, I'll say that it's not normal to hate and disrespect someone because they're different than you. I had a muslim boyfriend for a year. I never agreed with his religion, but I did respect his choice to make himself a more spiritual being. I never made raghead jokes and laugh; nor did I challenge the validity of his religion. And it was his CHOICE of religion. \n \n I don't have a choice about being gay. It's just how I am and how I was born.

   "NOTWITHSTANDING the old joke that an Irish homosexual is a man who prefers women to drink, a group of Irish gays and lesbians applied this year for an official presence in the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York. Resistance was interpreted by liberal politicians like Mayor David Dinkins as bigotry. It is better understood as instinctive resentment at being asked to bestow moral approval on the practice of homosexuality.\n \n The St. Patrick's Day parade celebrates not only Irishness but Catholicism, which frowns on homoesexuality. No doubt many of the marchers privately do things incompatible with Catholicism, or merely irrelevant to it. But they do not seek to march behind banners such as \"Irish Adulterers\" or \"Irish Stamp Collectors.\" Does homosexuality have any more to do with being Irish than stamp collecting or adultery?\n \n Most Popular Articles\n in News\n Naked boys vs. naked ...\n Black Women White ...\n EUROFILE: BAROMETER - ...\n How Tyler Perry rose ...\n Tisha Campbell-Martin ... \n The St. Patrick's Day controversy indicates that the demand for \"gay rights\" is essentially a demand for respect and approval rather than for rights. And it begins with numbers.\n \n By some current estimates about 10 per cent of the male population in the Western world is homosexual. Homosexual groups tend to cite the higher figure, presumably because that makes homosexuality seem more acceptable. Other estimates go as low as 5 or 3 per cent. However, these are no more than guesses; and they refer to an average: the proportion in San Francisco may be higher; elsewhere it may be lower. About female homosexuality not enough is known even for a guess. Little is known as well about homosexuality in the non-Western world, or in the past. Further, homosexuality is vaguely defined: do we include only persons who have sexual activity with others of the same sex exclusively, or also those who do so preponderantly or just occasionally? (Perhaps the label \"bisexual\" better suits the last category.)\n \n Advertisement\n \n Has the proportion of homosexuals in the U.S. population increased recently? They certainly have become more visible. It is not possible, however, to determine whether the same number of homosexuals has become more visible, owing to recently lessened legal and social pressures, or whether the number has actually increased. Less pressure might lead some to activate homosexual inclinations which previously they did not avow even to themselves. There may be more homosexual activity, then, or just more open homosexual activity, or both.\n \n Whatever its size, a homosexual minority is known to have existed in all societies throughout history. At times that minority was fully accepted; at other times merely tolerated, or even ferociously suppressed. Suppression reduces visibility; it also leads some to give up homosexual activity. Still, the most ferocious suppression, including the death penalty, has never stamped out homosexuality altogether.\n \n Causes and Effects\n \n WHAT causes homosexuality? And what causes the hostility of many heterosexuals? The simplest and, amongs homosexuals, the most popular theory explains that homosexuality is just as genetic as heterosexuality. There is indeed some evidence for genetic inheritance: identical twins separated at birth tend both to be either homosexual or heterosexual; babies with a homosexual natural father, adopted by heterosexual families, tend to become homosexual. This suggests a degree of genetic disposition, which, in some cases, seems to be sufficient to produce homosexuality. But the genetic disposition does not seem to be necessary or sufficient. Homosexuality occurs in families that have not known it before, and heterosexuality occurs in children of homosexuals.\n \n If homosexuality were altogether genetic, its frequency would diminish over time. Homosexuals have fewer children than heterosexuals. Thus, the proportion of homosexuals in the population would diminish, if homosexuality were produced solely, or even mainly, by genetic factors. However, there is no indication of a smaller proportion of homosexuals. One must conclude that homosexual behavior depends partly on environmental influences, even if genetic dispositions play an as yet unquantified role.\n \n We know very little about the early intrafamilial and later extrafamilial factors that may contribute to homosexual behavior. Theories abound, some quite plausible, but none fully demonstrated. A goodly proportion of homosexuality may be caused by very early imprinting in babies. But this is a possibility rather than a certainty. The most widely accepted theories postulate an unacceptable paternal figure, who is either too weak, or too punitive dominating, or too distant, combined with an overly possessive maternal figure on whom the infant comes to depend excessively for emotional support. There are many such constellations, but they are not found in all cases. Nor are narcissism or unconscious castration fears.\n \n The American Psychiatric Association used to list homosexuality as a disease, although homosexuality does not shorten life, is not painful, and does not impair desired functions--which is what diseases do, by definition. The listing was a thinly disguised moral judgment. The recent delisting expressed a change in moral judgment. But it is justified also because there never was any clinical evidence for the disease listing. Psychiatrists should not make moral judgments disguised as medical ones.\n \n Similarly, what is now called homophobia--namely, the dislike of homosexuals--is scarcely a phobia, i.e., a pathological fear. A phobia person suffers great anxiety in the presence of the object of his phobia, which he will try to avoid. Now, people who dislike homosexuals may be unsure of their own sexual identity, or may have made an adverse moral judgment on homosexuality, or may have an irrational prejudice against it. None of this phobic. \"Homophobia\" is also an illiterate coinage, which literally means fear of one's own kind, e.g., fear of homosexuals by homosexuals or of heterosexuals by heterosexuals, but not fear of the former by the latter.\n \n Is homosexuality associated specifically with promiscuity? Some homosexuals have stable relations with each other just as married heterosexuals do. Others are moderately or extremely promiscuous. The most promiscuous homosexuals are the most highly visible, but seem also to constitute a higher proportion of homosexuals than of heterosexuals.\n \n Higher promiscuous behavior is usually a symptom of a personality disturbance, most often compulsiveness. Some promiscuous persons hate their own behavior. Others make it the center of their life. Since homosexuality is not disease, it need not and cannot be \"cured.\" However, when homosexual behavior is symptomatic of an underlying personality disturbance, treatment of that disturbance may lead to a change, including a change of the sexual object. In other cases, treatment may lead to the patient's fuller acceptance, with less conflict, of some homosexual pattern.\n \n God's Will\n \n JUDAIC AND Christian Scriptural tradition condemsn homosexuality as contrary to God's will (there are some, rather strained, dissenting interpretations). Thus, the view of traditional believers is preordained: homosexual acts are sinful. Other traditions (including most legal ones) condemn homosexuality as contrary to nature. However, nature makes homosexuality possible (else there would be no problem) and can acquire the prescriptive authority ascribed to it only if it is believed to reveal the divine will. Thus \"contrary to nature\" is not essentially different from \"contrary to God's will.\" This won't do for unbelievers; nor for a society legislating according to non-revealed secular principles.\n \n Our Constitution is mute on homosexuality. The idea that we can read into it whatever is reasonable or fashionable, by interpreting \"emanations,\" is unconvincing. Thus, if states prohibit sodomy they may be silly, but the Constitution does not prohibit silliness. We should vote against such prohibitions, however. Prohibition is unlikely to be effective, and consensual sodomy by adults at worst harms the participants, who ought to be free to harm themselves.\n \n Admittedly, anal intercourse brings a high risk of infection with the AIDS virus. But this sexual practice is not always, nor exclusively, engaged in by homosexuals. Nor is it the only way in which the virus is transmitted. Homosexuals do, however, take the risk of anal intercourse more often than heterosexuals, and thus are more vulnerable to the disease. Nonetheless, AIDS is not a specific homosexual disease.",

   "Homosexuality is not a disease (nor can it be labeled a preference; preferences are voluntary and homosexuality rarely is). Yet homosexuality is perceived by the majority of people as a defect. There is no way of showing that perception to be wrong. Compare homosexuality to a limp, acquired or inborn. The limping person may be a brilliant mathematician, philospher, artist, polician, businessman, or physician. He may be charming as well. Still, he will not do for baseball games and some other sports; nor will he be a good companion on long walks. For those to whom these things matter, his defect matters. Even for others it will matter at times, particularly when they are young.\n \n Homosexuality is certainly not a physical defect. But in the eyes of most heterosexuals, it is a physchological one. Most if not all males, at the beginning of their sexuakl careers, are intimidated by, even fearful of, women. In time they overcome much of that fear. Heterosexuals feel that somehow homosexuals do not; and that they take the easy way out by turning to their own sex. There may be some truth to this vague and half-conscious theory, though it may explain more about heterosexual attitudes than about homosexual behavior.\n \n At any rate, the belief does not mean that homosexuals are less good than heterosexuals. Despite his limp, a man may be a much better person than another who does not limp. However, the heterosexual belief means that, in the eyes of most heterosexuals, homosexuality is a physchological defect. Nothing will persuade heterosexuals to believe that homosexuality is physchologically or morally as legitimate as their own heterosexuality. They cannot be shown to be wrong, and they should not be compelled by law to act as if they were.\n \n Advertisement\n \n Mr. van den Haag is a Distinguised Scholar at the Heritage Foundation and a retired physchoanalyst.\n \n COPYRIGHT 1991 National Review, Inc.\n COPYRIGHT 2004 Gale Group",

This would mean the more one reproduces, the more one has positively contributed. There are many other ways to contribute to humanity. At any rate, your side doesn't gang up on heterosexuals who don't reproduce. Gay people may reproduce the natural way too, with members of the other sex.

The pleasure individuals find in the sexual act is the incentive that Nature has provided to induce to engage in sex and thus reproduce.\n \n I have nothing against gays for I know the poor things were born this way. I am sure that given the option they would cease to be gays. But since they are trapped in their condition all they can do to save face is that they like it that way. But please don't tell me that gays are normal. They are not, they are a miniscule percentage of men. Mother Nature is not perfect, people are born with many defects not only the homosexual deviation. Life is a lottery.\n \n Obviously mae and I have forced them to look at the facts and the facts are painful to them therefore they reacted angrily, with insults and hate. \n \n I do feel sorry for them and I can see now that they are in denial.

   "Concerning this issue that gays can't reproduce with each other, I think the real question is, should the fact gays can't reproduce with a partner in the context of romantic love and bonding really mean anything? It's true they can't (obviously). And to respond to someone pointing that out by saying they CAN reproduce in other ways (with someone they don't love or artificial insemination) is to sort of ignore their point. But does it really matter that it's this way? I'd say no, because there are opposite-sex couples that are in the same boat, so to speak. Any opposite-sex couple who could not have children because of some problem would be limited to the same options as well, and it's not like it's something extremely uncommon. Lots of couples can't have kids the natural way. You can't reasonably use that as an argument against gay relationships.",

For something to be self-deprecating it has to come from within the group being ridiculed. In layman's terms. For a joke about gays to be self-deprecating it has to have come from someone who is gay - not you.\n \n Also - to respond to something with any kind of humor, said thing needs to be funny. \n \n \nYet in the near future it will be possible to take a sperm stem cell then force it to become an egg. The egg then will be fertilized by a sperm. Then will be placed ectopically under the abdominal wall of a man. So someday soon it will be possible for two men to reproduce a child that is gentially related to each and carried by one of the men.\n\n \n Wake up man! This is not likely to happen anywhere in the near or even distant future. Even if they were able to change the genetics of the egg to mimic the sperm or vice versa - there is a lot more involved in carrying a baby than carrying a baby. There is a whole system of supporting the fetus that a male simply does not have and would be pretty close to impossible to create artificially inside a person. Since we, as a race, are not having trouble reproducing you will also be hard pressed to find many willing to invest the resources to make this happen. If you want children there are plenty of options available to you. (Want my teenager? Just kidding)\n \n I believe all people are equal. I am raising my son with a gay man. I know first hand that they can be marvelous parents, and that they have the exact same potential as any other person born. They are capable of love, loving relationships and full and meaningful lives and (once out of the closet) are not Winston's (and several other homophobe's) fantasy of self-loathing, wishing-they-were-something-else deviants. However we all have biological limitations. I can not pee standing or experience a hard-on, you can not be pregnant.\n \n \nThe most widely accepted theories postulate an unacceptable paternal figure, who is either too weak, or too punitive dominating, or too distant, combined with an overly possessive maternal figure on whom the infant comes to depend excessively for emotional support. \n\n \n This is not true.\n \n \n\n However, the heterosexual belief means that, in the eyes of most heterosexuals, homosexuality is a physchological defect. Nothing will persuade heterosexuals to believe that homosexuality is physchologically or morally as legitimate as their own heterosexuality.\n\n \n Please refrain from speaking for anyone but yourself.\n \n \n\n I have nothing against gays for I know the poor things were born this way. \n\n \n This sentence is a complete contradiction.\n \n \nI am sure that given the option they would cease to be gays. \n\n \n And just how are you sure of this?\n \n \nObviously mae and I have forced them to look at the facts and the facts are painful to them therefore they reacted angrily, with insults and hate. \n\n \n You and Mae have not presented anything not seen before.

   "Jitobear:\n \n I have had so much fun upsetting the homosexuals in this Forum. I feel a touch guilty for the poor things were born the way they are and they are stuck with it. It would be interesting if they would regal us with their experiences, for instance about the day they became aware that they were part of the 5 % of males who lusted after other males and talked and behaved like females. It must have been a shock for the poor dahlings, right? So many girls and not enough boys. Anyway, there must be a reason then for the amount of males born is higher than females and the reason must be to compensate for the 5%. \n \n \n I feel sorry for your kid. First his father abandon him and swims back to M\u00e9jico lindo and into the arms of some se\u00f1orita, right? What has she got that you haven't? Maybe is her Spanish.\n Then you shack up with a gay and he becomes legally his \"Dad\" although he does not share his bed with you but with another guy. Wow! That is what you would call a 'normal' marriage? Yes, of course you would.\n I am not gonna ask you who you share your bed with, but I wouldn't be surprised if it is a she.\n No wonder your kid has such a hard time at the school yard. I think it is a miracle he has not been traumatised for life. He might end up voting Republican or worse.\n The only normal people in your family are your parents. Poor folks, no wonder they didn't have much to thank for at Thanksgiving. \n Well, I also enjoy arguing with you here. You have a sense of humour for after all to give your kid a gay for a dad is a good funny joke.\n \n No, I don't have anything against dy ... I mean female homosexuals (lesbians?) for I agree totally with them, to have sex with men is Yuk! Revolting, a vomit inducing thought and sodomy? Please, I am eating my dinner.\n \n One final question how do homosexuals avoid getting pregnant? I have never heard of a pregnant homosexual have you? So maybe the question is this: if the only difference between homosexual couples and heterosexual couples is their sexual orientation and their sexual orientation is 'normal' then how come they never beget children, in other words how come that the 'she' in the 'marriage' never ever get pregnant? \n \n Just asking. emoticon_cool",

   "I have had so much fun upsetting the homosexuals in this Forum. \n\n \n Oh, I think you over-estimate your impact.\n \n \nI feel a touch guilty for the poor things were born the way they are and they are stuck with it. \n\n \n And this is why you don't get to complain about being insulted.\n \n \nIt would be interesting if they would regal us with their experiences, for instance about the day they became aware that they were part of the 5 % of males who lusted after other males \n\n \n I suspect it would be interesting to hear when they realized they were gay. I personally find the full spectrum of human experience interesting.\n \n \nand talked and behaved like females. \n\n \n I see your experience with homosexuals is a lame stereotype. My kid's dad is 6'3\" burly blonde who enjoys working on muscle cars, fishing and managing his lake-front property (cutting down trees, etc.). He is 42 and scores off the charts in strength and looks amazing in jeans in and in a suit. He earns the respect of every man he meets and turns the head of every woman. You attend his birthday party and his closest friends are gay, lesbians, straight and single women (ME) and straight family men with kids.\n \n \nIt must have been a shock for the poor dahlings, right? So many girls and not enough boys. Anyway, there must be a reason then for the amount of males born is higher than females and the reason must be to compensate for the 5%\n\n \n Actually - more boys are born than girls. Its just that boys die easier - partly due to things like jack-XXX, risky macho tricks and war.\n \n \nI feel sorry for your kid. \n\n \n Don't. If you want someone to pity - look in the mirror.\n \n \nFirst his father abandon him and swims back to M\u00e9jico lindo and into the arms of some se\u00f1orita, right? \n\n \n Now, let me kick a hole in your mysogany. My ex did not leave me for another woman. He left because I threw his sorry XXX out and filed for divorce. The fact he did not step up as father despite that is simply indication that we are better off without him. We have lost NOTHING. \n \n \nWhat has she got that you haven't? Maybe is her Spanish.\n\n \n You have this backwards. For a woman to put up with my ex it would be about what I have that she doesn't - namely a brain and a backbone.\n \n Y - my espa\u00f1ol es muy bien.\n \n \nThen you shack up with a gay and he becomes legally his \"Dad\" although he does not share his bed with you but with another guy. Wow! That is what you would call a 'normal' marriage? Yes, of course you would.\n\n \n I am not married. I am divorced. I own a house in North Minneapolis. My son's father is in a relationship and owns a house in South Minneapolis. He became my son's mentor when my son was 7 - he adopted my son in what is known as a co-parent adoption about a year and a half ago. It does not require the couple to be married. Its like two parents who have joint custody after a divorce - only we were never a couple. We are friends.\n \n \nI am not gonna ask you who you share your bed with, but I wouldn't be surprised if it is a she.\n\n \n I'm straight. Believe it or don't. I don't find the implication that I may be a lesbian any more insulting than the implication that I may have green eyes (they are blue). I am not you. I don't share your prejudice against gays. This is an ineffective way to bait me.\n \n \nNo wonder your kid has such a hard time at the school yard. \n\n \n Did you read my post? I mentioned one kid that was an issue and pointed out specifically that my son's friends have no problem with his dad. If you are going to chat me up about my life, please don't make stuff up.\n \n \nI think it is a miracle he has not been traumatised for life. \n\n \n Why thank you! I will take that as a compliment. I am proud of having raised such a tolerant, loving, open-minded, tough creature. Would hate to have one that gets truamatized simply because something or someone is different than himself.\n \n \nHe might end up voting Republican or worse.\n\n \n I am not a member of any political party. This. also, is an ineffective way to bait me.\n \n \nThe only normal people in your family are your parents. Poor folks, no wonder they didn't have much to thank for at Thanksgiving.\n\n \n I have a huge family. My mom had 10 siblings. I have about 70 cousins, two brothers, a sister, four neices, two nephews, a grandma, about 15 aunts and uncles - and then there are all the spouses. The funny thing is that the only ones who have an issue with my son's dad are those who have not met him.\n \n However - if you mean by \"normal\" that they \"hate gays like me\" you are wrong. My mom has no problem with homosexuals at all and likes my son's dad quite well. My dad has never been comfortable with them but tends to follow along with his pyscho wife who hates gays, blacks, and Mexicans (remember what I told you about my kid's biological father?). \n \n The point is that you know nothing of my family. If you care to - ask - don't make stuff up.\n \n \nWell, I also enjoy arguing with you here. You have a sense of humour for after all to give your kid a gay for a dad is a good funny joke.\n\n \n I allowed a good, loving, dedicated, loyal, responsible, amazing, wonderful man to adopt him - and I did it in all seriousness. I do take offense at the implication that I am fliipant in regards to decisions about my son.\n \n \nNo, I don't have anything against dy ... I mean female homosexuals (lesbians?) for I agree totally with them, to have sex with men is Yuk! Revolting, a vomit inducing thought and sodomy? Please, I am eating my dinner.\n\n \n My my my - what a teeny, tiny, boring little world you box yourself in. No tolerance, understanding, or empathy for anything outside your own personal experience. How sad. How unimaginative. How dull. I really do feel sorry for you - poor thing.\n \n \nOne final question how do homosexuals avoid getting pregnant? I have never heard of a pregnant homosexual have you? So maybe the question is this: if the only difference between homosexual couples and heterosexual couples is their sexual orientation and their sexual orientation is 'normal' then how come they never beget children, in other words how come that the 'she' in the 'marriage' never ever get pregnant? \n \n Just asking. emoticon_cool\n\n \n I know a gay man who is a biological grandfather. I'll just let you chew on that.\n \n It seems, like my son's biological father, you need to learn this simple lesson;\n Parenting isn't about who you ####.",

This explains why you should alway say gay people are mentally retarded.\n\n \n Are you nutz? Well, I would imagine most people on this board, on both sides of the aisle, are far from retarded. Childlishly calling us \"retarted,\" in itself, is a very retarded comment. There are college professors, scientists, social workers, business analysts, artists, for example, that frequent these boards.\n \n To answer your question to 1: Me! I'm married to a man as are many others on this board. I can assure you that none of us are mentally challenged. Actually, the last time I was given an IQ test, I came out as gifted, a few ticks below genius. God only knows how that happened.\n \n And then #2. Ahhh, therein lies the whole problem .... the \"ick\" factor. If you were comfortable with you own sexuality, you probably would not have an issue with this. My best friend is straight and I am godfather to his 3 children. He and his family have no problem with my being gay, obviously. \n \n You're just living under a rock.

One could also say... if the human race did not want homosexuality in it, homosexuality would have died out long ago.
