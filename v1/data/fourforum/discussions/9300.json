   "Problem is, Jyoshu is that the Bible prescribes and most Evangelical churches adopt, the formula for a believer that has fallen, which is to strip that person of any leadership responsibilities (especially a pastor). Then, as the person repents and recovers, leadership responsibilities may be returned. I know of one such instance where a member in my church has struggled with a certain sin issue in his life. His position as pastor of small groups was stripped from him until his restoration was complete (about two-and-a-half years).\n\n \n I don't think I've ever heard of a church that reinstated a minister after he admitted he was gay. Even upon a 'repentance'. Have you? \n A lot of Christians view homosexuality as a lot worse and darker sin than the Bible makes it out to be--they take that and it colors their view of a gay person as a person, which is taking it too far. Gay people are right when they say that things like divorce are a lot more prevalent of a problem; I think churches need to cool it some on the homosexuality thing and simply work on showing the love of Christ.",

There's plenty of good, moral men and women of God in church leadership who don't engage in sexual immorality. I know quite a few of them. You just never hear about them in the press because the press almost always is on the hunt for the immoral disgracers.
