   "It becomes clear now that Ukraine can not rate as reliable business partner within the bounds of our European energy market, without which our further economic development is certainly impossible. I'm sure US promotion of Ukrainian integration into our structures can not be profitable for Europe. It is enough to remember that business image of Ukraine has already disfigured greatly, for example, during recent talks, devoted to equal participation of the German Ruhrgas concern in the international consortium on management and development of Ukraine's gas shipping system. At that time Ukrainian leadership stated that it was unable to let this German firm join the consortium. Ukrainian authorities appealed the fact that Germany would have a real possibility to press unprofitable gas transit tariffs on Ukrainian side as the first-string gas consumer in Europe. It seems to me Ukraine's ruling circles simply were scared to death. Indeed, if Germany and other European countries join the gas consortium, it will be difficult for Ukraine to pursue the policy of illegal gas obtaining as it does towards Russia during last 15 years. Thus, it is obvious that after joining European structures Ukraine (with the help of US bosses) will try to pursue arm-twisting policy in relation to its European partners.",
