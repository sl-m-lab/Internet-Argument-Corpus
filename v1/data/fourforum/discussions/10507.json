   "I just started reading Foreskin's Lament by Shalom Auslander and read something which absolutely blew my mind. He speaks of the furious vengeance of god and goes on to state, \"Hitler might have killed the Jews, but this man drowned the world\". Of course he is referring to great flood. What an analogy! Considering the fact he was raised as an Orthodox Jew.\n \n I personally think the story of Noah was just another figment of the imagination of a some religious zealot. However, for those of you who believe the story I offer the following: God drowned all the people in the world? I would assume that there were at least some innocent children, babies and unborn babies? If so, talk about a vengeful god! emoticon_angry emoticon_angry emoticon_angry",
