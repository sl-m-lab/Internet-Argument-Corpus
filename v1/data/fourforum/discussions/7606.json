   "Forgive me if this is the wrong topic in which to post this (mods feel free to move). I've searched to see if anyone has discussed the CRACK program. A brief description: it's a private program which pays people who choose to use drugs $200 to sterilize themselves. The main target drug was crack in the past, but I'm sure they wouldn't reject someone whose preferred drug was heroin, cocaine, etc.\n The program was started by a woman who adopted several children from a mother on crack. After the umpteenth child, she thought of preventing an unwanted life being brought into the world.\n This is different from the eugenics movement or any goverment mandated program as it is voluntary. Some objections are that it's not helping drug addicts get treatment, or that it can't be voluntary if a person's using drugs. Some proponents argue that many addicts do not want treatment or that a person who cannot sign a contract should not be entrusted to raise a child.\n I'm all for the program. I believe that for every parent who quits crack and becomes a great role model, etc, there are several others who do not quit, will not become good parents, and will inevitably instill the addiction cycle anew with their own children. Even if they quit, I believe the underlying issues will remain, barring them from becoming good parents anyway.\n What are your thoughts? For or against? What modifications are needed to make you support it if previously against?",

   "\"Sterilize themselves\"? How exactly does one sterilize ones self?\n \n How many people would be capable of doing that to themselves?\n \n No one. Which makes me wonder just where that line came from. Nazsmith, did you make that one up? Did you mean to say: Pay addicts $200 to submit themselves to being sterilized? Of course you did. It's funny how it sounds worse when someone else is going to sterilize them. Am I splitting hairs?\n \n This is a terrible idea for a program. Pipers out of rock would let you cut off parts of their bodies more noticible than sterilization for $200.\n \n Using someone's being different to alter them reminds me of something else.\n \n I say that you MUST get them off of drugs first. You MUST also make this program available to everyone. We wouldn't want suburban males feigning drug addiction for reduced vasectomy rates, now would we?",

   "Did you mean to say: Pay addicts $200 to submit themselves to being sterilized? Of course you did. It's funny how it sounds worse when someone else is going to sterilize them. Am I splitting hairs?\n\n \n Sure. Either way. If somehow we had the technology to take a pill for sterilization, then a person would sterilize his/herself. I'm sure this program would not bicker against people taking a sterilization pill. The end result is the same so I mean both.\n Whether or not it sounds worse doesn't matter to anyone other than the PR person for the program:) Seriously, without logical arguments against the program, whether something \"sounds worse\" is just emotional thinking.\n \n \n \n\n Using someone's being different to alter them reminds me of something else.\n\n \n What does this mean?\n \n \n\n I say that you MUST get them off of drugs first. You MUST also make this program available to everyone. We wouldn't want suburban males feigning drug addiction for reduced vasectomy rates, now would we?\n\n \n I do agree that we SHOULD get them off drugs first. But what if that person WANTS to be on drugs? What if that person decides they want to use a mind-altering substance and are aware that they may engage in risky sexual behavior but do not want children? A potential drug user now can simply have children and pawn them off to tax-paying citizens.\n And I do agree that this program should be made available to everyone. That's actually my only problem with the program. There are quite a few intelligent young adults who think sterilization is a good idea for themselves (they're also annoyed at the fact that no doctor wants to sterilize them, but that's another topic). I wish I had the financial werewithal to start my own that gives financial assistance to those who want to become sterile. Doesn't that \"sound\" better?",

   "\"Sterilize themselves\"? How exactly does one sterilize ones self?\n By going to a clinic and getting a doctor to perform a vasectomy (how omninus!)? They don't mean giving a drug addict a rusty knife and saying 'chop it off'.\n \n\n How many people would be capable of doing that to themselves?\nI don't know? How about a person from a group known to do almost anything to get money, but also realises the pain they would bring to a child if they had one.\n \n\n Using someone's being different to alter them reminds me of something else.\n Rehab, or perhaps the penal system?\n \n \n\n I say that you MUST get them off of drugs first. You MUST also make this program available to everyone. We wouldn't want suburban males feigning drug addiction for reduced vasectomy rates, now would we?\nThey are reversable opperations (though probably not affordable for the average addict) and while risky are less risky than being a drug addict, and certainly less risky than being a fetus within a drug addict, or probably even a drug addict's child.\n Still, you should always try to get them off the drugs if you can, but I don't see why its necessary to do it first. Going to be a lot easier to get them to see a doctor if there is $200 in it for them.",
