   "A friend of mine was having a political discussion online with one of his friends. During the course of the discussion, several issues came up that she disagreed with. When he challenged her about her disagreement, stating that what he was saying was a fact, she said, \"I don't believe there's such a thing as facts.\" He saved the IM to show me because it was so unbelievable.\n \n He asked her if the existence of the sun was a fact, and she said no. She said we can feel its heat, but do we know it really exists? To me, this seems like a philosophical question.\n \n Do facts really exist?\n \n I think yes. \"There are no facts\" is an impossible Boolean statement (I'm sure there's a real name for this kind of thing, but I don't know what it is. If anybody does, I'd like to know). It will always be false. If it's false, it's false. If it's true, it's false, because it then becomes a fact.\n \n I don't understand how anybody can think this way. Is it possible to be so open minded that you can eventually circle back around to having a closed mind?",

   "This rancid interpretation of postmodernism stands tall in most Arts faculties, at least in Australia, and is passed down from the intellectuals (as defined by Rothbard) to undergrads and to a lesser extent, high school students, as a form of wisdom. Hell it isn't uncommon to see similar views being expressed on this very board. \n \n It is appealing because it allows crackpot theories to flourish, with a wave of the hand you can dismiss any concerns about the empirical, or especially logical, merit of your position, and take whatever stance you felt like taking before considering reality.\n \n Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged demonstrates remarkable foresight when it caricatured philosophy in a degenerating society much the same way, in 1957.\n \n \nI think yes. \"There are no facts\" is an impossible Boolean statement (I'm sure there's a real name for this kind of thing, but I don't know what it is. If anybody does, I'd like to know). \n\n \n Try self-referential fallacy maybe?\n \n The counter-argument (which generally, even the people making recognise is crapola) is that they aren't claiming \"there are no facts\" is a fact, they're merely stating an opinion or \"raising the possiblity\" or some other garbage. Even if this were true, it would undermine their position, since they would admit the opposite of their claim was \"equally valid\". \n \n But you may then ask, is it a fact they are stating an opinion?",

   "A fact is a pragmatic truth, a statement that can, at least in theory, be checked and either confirmed or denied. \n \n Your friends example.\n \n The sun exists.\n \n How do we know? We can see it through telescopes, we can see it during the day (you know during sunset it becomes easier on the eyes.) NASA has confirmed as well as other nations with space programs, etc. We can feel it's heat. How can anyone deny this? Simply by using our senses we know that it exists. This would be a scientific way of explaining it. \n \n Now if it were in a philosophical view. How do we know what we see is not real? What if it's all made up or if our minds just perceive as such. If that were truly case (I would say to your friend, etc.) then there would be no point in anything would there, since everything would be chaotic. Nothing would follow any sort of laws or rules. That means if I run out of my room right now, I'd be in Wal-mart. Or if I closed my eyes all of sudden I would be in space. Has that ever happened to anyone? Reality is perception from our senses. Anything else would not be reality and since we are living in reality, therefore \"the sun exists is a fact.\"",

   "She's right in a sense, there is no such thing as known fact. Any statement we make about the absolute truth of something contains a number of unspoken caveats, ranging from \"assuming we can believe the evidence provided by our sense, that we exist, and that our thoughts are logical\" to \"assuming the universe is as it appears to be and wasn't created 5 seconds ago to look like it does now\" and right through to (alarmingly often) \"assuming that I'm right and everyone else is stupid\". It is laborious in normal circumstances to make plain all these caveats, and in fact in daily discourse it is largely unnecessary, as we each live most of our lives within a bubble of shared assumptions.\n \n Consequently there are \"truths\" within a given community which appear logical to everyone within that community because they rely on a shared and often unspoken caveat. \"Cultural divides\" appear when these unspoken caveats are not shared and are too deep down to be discussed. The obvious example I can think of is \"the constitution is always right\" which is a perfectly reasonable working point from a US perspective, but to a Briton seems utterly bizarre to have someone think they've won an argument by proving that what is being suggested is unconstitutional.",
