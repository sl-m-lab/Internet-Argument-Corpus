What's in it for them?\n\n \n China and Japan have both been propping up the US economy for years in order to maintain access to our consumer market. They have reached the point that they essentailly just add it to overhead costs. \n \n The day will come, and is quickly approaching, that the cost of propping up our economy and our dollar will no longer be economical. Then we will be in real trouble.\n \n Some would argue that day is essentially here. Currently our bonds are paying more than CANADAS. 10 yrs ago people would have scoffed at the very idea. We are having to pay higher rates due to a higher percieved risk in investing in our bonds.",

Why are they so willing to finance America's borrowing spree? What's in it for them?\n\n \n I can direct you to numerous technical articles on why China (and Japan) indulges US fiscal irresponsibility, but, IMO, the bottom line is still China's plan to raise their domestic per-capita income to a level where internal consumption will consume a balanced share of their rapidly expanding industrial capability. While $1500 is the per-capita income, that number is already well over $3500 in professional/industrial sectors. As the US and others gobble up Chinese exports, we're basically financing their infrastructure and manufacturing development to achieve that goal, which will provide China with the world's largest GDP in the next decade. \n \n While China experiences a book loss on accumulation of USD reserves as the USD fades, I'd think they view it simply as a cost of doing business to achieve their goals. Their assumption of our debt is minuscule when compared to our total outstanding debt and the capital investment they gain from feeding our growing irresponsibility.\n \n One of the statements made by China before Hu's recent US visit was the intent to reduce assumption of US debt by importing more US products using those US dollars. From a financial viewpoint the purchase of a fleet of modern Boeing airliners using net present value USD supports that intent. There was actually more US publicity of Hu's time with Bill Gates, Boeing and other luminaries than his 'official' meetings with Bush. During the official meetings nothing was accomplished other than a typical creditor (China) politely listening to a typical debtor (US) whine. \n \n When ever I now consider China's economic motives, I'm reminded of a US political cartoon published during Hu's visit:\n \n The scene is a vast US crowd holding signs protesting China's policies at one of Hu's public US appearances. The caption is Hu saying 'Not to worry, the signs were all made in China'.",

   "@ daewoo & georged\n \n Thanks for patiently answering my inquiry: now I'll ask for your speculations about the future:\n \n In your opinion, is China playing an unbeatable hand? For the time being it has a vast and docile pool of very cheap labour, manufacturing things craved by Western consumers. And it doesn't have the social costs that shackle Western capitalism. \n \n It also has an authoritarian government in a cynical partnership with entrepreneurs who would probably be castigated as 'exploitative robber barons' in our society.\n \n These economic cards add up to something like a Royal Flush.\n \n But these advantages presumably have a shelf life. Eventually, if China acquires the world's largest GDP, won't a popular clamour for 'caring and sharing' then become irresistible? In other words, will China, when it gets rich enough, follow the same path of credit-driven consumerism and political goody-goodyism that threatens to put the US out of business? \n \n Maybe a belief in the 'right' to be affluent will contribute to their undoing as it has to ours.",

As I've aged the timespan of my economic thoughts and concerns have focused on about 10-years beyond my statistical lifespan, only because I find it simple to see that far out with current trends and information. The last economic Royal Flush drawn by an empire was the US after WW2, and we've certainly left our descendants with a super-sized mess (fast food pun intended). Most of the US general public, including the strength of any nation, its youth, are unaware of their economic future. I'll leave it to them to determine what they and others are capable of achieving. Our leadership certainly has no qualms about screwing them into oblivion.",
