   "Russia is probably the second most powerful nation in the world and their military power keeps our boys in the defense department ever trying to become even more powerful. But the fact is that Russia and the US didn't go to war during the Cold War and that was about the most tension fill era of all time considering it lasted for many decades and it would only take one press of a button to set it into motion. The US and Russia are just so powerful that going to war is infeasible and they both know it. That is why I wouldn't expect that Russia is ever going to be a major threat to the US nor will the US be a major threat to them.\n \n I would say that the biggest threat to the US at this point is the Chinese-Russian alliance. If the US were ever to attack China then Russia is supposed to join their ally in war against us. So if China were to just attack Taiwan and provoke a military action by the US it is possible that it could lead to a China-Russia alliance against the US.",

   "Russia desires to be number one\n\n \n China desires to be number one. European nations desire to be number one. India, South Africa, and Haiti desire to be number one just as much as the US does. Now does that make everyone a possible threat to our way of life? Of course it does. We are the lead dog and there are only two ways to go from here. Either we stay on this path or we fall from it. This fact also makes the US a threat to everyone who is a threat to them. Based on this endless loop you would tend to believe that world war is inevitable against the US. However, as the Cold War showed us, the desire to be number one can only be achieved through economics and politics, not through a messy war that has the outstanding potential to go nuclear. So I ask you, what do you expect that Russia will do to become number one that will not in turn result in them becoming a desolate wasteland more so than they already are?\n \n \nAs soon as Russia percieves America is  not a nation under God, America bites the flames\n\n \n Or Russia could collapse tomorrow. They are not exactly what you would call a stable nation. Heck if they went to war parts of their own country would rebel against them. They would be fighting a war on two fronts right off the bat not to mention that every country on their border could probably march their armies in and cover hundreds of miles before reaching any real resistance. Russia cannot gaurd their borders and deal with internal strife and deal with the US at the same time unless the events were to be quick which would probably mean nuclear war. Since Russia cannot become number one through nuclear war it would be pointless for them to attempt such a thing.\n \n I've run through the same scenario as you have probably done and each time I came to the conclusion that Russia is incapable of a real war against the US without most of the world backing them. Even then the US has the most advanced military in the world and the most powerful economy in the world. The free market would essentially collapse causing a mass depression which could only be countered by going to war. Every nation would have to become a war machine or rearrange their entire economy around the new war with the US. Since most nations would probably choose war machine the ones who didn't would be vulnerable to attack so they would probably also move to become war machines. It becomes the worst war imaginable with essentially no rules. If anyone enters US territory they get blown up. In turn the US is blown up and just before this happens the US blows up everyone they can. Nuclear attacks make the US and much of the civilized world a stone age wonder and the environment falls apart. Food is scarce, disease is rampant, government leadership is severely weakened and unable to deal with the problems. So Russia becomes #1 alright but are they actually better off than they are right now? Not a chance. Infact they stand a strong chance of being invaded by China, India, or another nation who has just too many people for their own good and need more food or technology or just want to grow in strength.\n \n This is the way I think it will go. China will become a superpower within the next 20-30 years and India, Russia, and the EU will become much more economically powerful. Everyone will enjoy seeing the US not be the only superpower and the playing field leveling out including Russia. Also Russia has the resources to do just about anything they want so the demand for commodities in China will greatly increase the amount of raw materials coming out of Russia as well as processed materials. Russia will probably always be second best to China and the US but they will see much success in doing this. As long as capitalism proves to increase the wealth of these new leaders of the world there will be no good reason for war against each other as they would only be hurting themselves.",
