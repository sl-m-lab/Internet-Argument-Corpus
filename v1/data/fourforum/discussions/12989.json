   "The government has not disputed the painful history that L.R., now 42, recounts in a court declaration. The man who became her tormentor first assaulted her when she was a teenager and he was a physical education coach, 14 years her senior, at a high school in the Mexican state of Guanajuato. He and his family were regarded as wealthy and influential because they owned a restaurant in town, L.R. said.\n \n Over the years, he made her live with him, and forced her to have sex with him by putting a gun or a machete to her head, by breaking her nose and by threatening to kill the small children of her sister. Once when she became pregnant, she said, she barely escaped alive after he had poured kerosene on the bed where she was sleeping and ignited it. He stole the salary she earned as a teacher and later sold her teacher's license.\n \n Local police dismissed her reports of violence as \"a private matter,\" the court documents said, and a judge she turned to for help tried to seduce her.\n \n \"In Mexico, men believe they have a right to abuse their women because they are like a possession,\" she said. With three children born from her involuntary sex with the man, who never married her, she fled to California in 2004. \n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/us/16asylum.html\n \n This story makes me very angry.\n \n I suspect that a number of men who post on this forum will fail to understand why.",

   "This is a HUGE problem in Mexico. The Macho Chauvinist culture views women is a distinctly putrid way. What's worse, many of the women buy into it. My wife told me of a 55y/o man who bought a 14 y/o girl for a 'wife' from her father for a case of Pepsi and some candy bars! These examples are why I don't believe in Cultural Relativism. I feel a true measure of a culture is how they treat their women and their dogs. In many places in Mexico they're treated about equally and in such a way that you'd be arrested for it here!\n \n My wife and I talk about this a lot and we're in agreement that for Mexico to move forward 3 things must take place. Women's rights(coupled with education), End corruption, Lessen the power of the Church(this SHOULD happen with better education lol).",

That is why you find so many of them here, working in restaurants.:p\n \n \nI mean, when one is 122 years old as you are, one must remember to take care of these things.\n\n \n LOL, the problem is that my advancing age is accompanied by declining memory.",
