   "This may turn out to be a self-extinguishing phenomenon.\n \n Christian, Maybe. Compassionate, Hardly. \n \n This is a commentary on the statistical surveys of the Christian Barna group, and especially its head, David Kinnaman. Kinnaman fears that Christianity has now become identified by obsessive homophobia:\n \n \nKinnaman focuses on young people 16-29, particularly those he calls \"outsiders\"-atheists, agnostics, adherents of other religions and the \"unchurched.\" Those now make up 40 percent of young people, he reports. Just a decade ago Christianity had an overwhelmingly positive image among the young, including outsiders, he says. But no longer.\n \n \"Our most recent data show that young outsiders have lost much of their respect for the Christian faith.\" They hold several negative images of Christianity: it is judgmental (87 percent agreed), too involved in politics (75 percent), hypocritical (85 percent), and out of touch (72 percent).\n \n But the predominant negative perception is that Christianity is \"antihomosexual.\" Fully 91 percent of \"outsiders\" say Christianity is anti-gay. Remarkably, 80 percent of young churchgoers agree: \n \n \"In our research, the perception that Christians are 'against' gays and lesbians-not only objecting to their lifestyle\"-i.e., sex-\"but also harboring irrational fear and unmerited scorn toward them-has reached critical mass. The gay issue has become the 'big one,' the negative image most likely to be intertwined with Christianity's reputation.\" In short, \"A new generation of adults ... now accepts homosexuality as a legitimate way of life.\"\n\n \n If young people are increasingly accepting of gay human beings on the one hand, and critical of Christianity for being obsessed with its homophobia on the other, what is the future for Christianity in the West?\n \n \nKinnaman's book is meant to warn Christians that their political influence on the issue of homosexuality will ebb and that they need to undertake a \"kinder, gentler\" approach to gays such as getting to know them, engaging them in conversation, showing compassion, and talking about Jesus instead of initially taking a moralistic approach.\n \n I am not sure that \"compassion\" is what gays expect these days. Acceptance is what most expect. But given the reiterated condemnations of \"the homosexual lifestyle\" (i.e., sex) by Kinnaman and his commentators in the book, evangelical Christians cannot offer that. It is their bottom line, their obsession. \n \n It's true. We don't expect compassion. We do not expect \"good Christians\" to lead us out of our \"sin\". We expect them to keep their interfering hands off, and accept us as human beings, perhaps a little bit different from them, but still with a place on this planet.\n\n \n Christianity these days has become offensive to gay people because of its constant condemnation of love we find natural. Their claim that gay love is somehow illegitimate is neither friendly, nor compassionate, nor accepting. It is obnoxious.\n \n If a new generation of Christians finds this message of acceptance increasingly compelling, what is the future of current Christian homophobia? I'd hope it's bleak. It won't die out till the last homophobe croaks, but I think it is on the way out.\n \n Surveys suggest that Old Christianity, the Christianity that hates gays, is not long for this world. No-one will mourn it. When it kicks the bucket, we will give it a not-so-fond farewell.",

He was quoting all sorts of \"material\" that made outrageous claims about gays and gay groups that were EASILY proven as lies.\n And his insistence on lashing out only furthered the image that Archie (and others like him) just don't give a damn about HONESTY, and will continue to quote sources that say things that are convenient for their cause, REGARDLESS OF STATUS OF TRUTH.\n \n In some ways, some elements of Christianity have traded parts of their \"morality soul\" in exchange for \"higher ground\" in going after gays.\n And it doesn't go unnoticed.\n \n And to exacerbate the issue, it ALSO doesn't go unnoticed when those elements of christianity lash out at gays with multi-million dollar campaigns, and other elements of christianity stay quiet. Quiet complacency can be viewed negatively.\n \n I think it's a fairly obvious observation that some elements of Christianity essentially fixate on homosexuality, elevating its \"sin\" status above and beyond numerous other sins in the bible.\n I think a day will come when, like racist or anti-semite prejudice, it is a rarity instead of something readily able to find.\n Christians will learn to keep their religious condemnation to themselves, cause THEIR religion is something THEY practice in THEIR lives, and not something that is called for to enforce in governmental law.\n .\n And if somebody else is Jewish, or gay, or divorced, that doesn't mean that they have to insist that the government discriminate against them as a form of \"religious expression\".",

Indeed, Christ taught a lot about this.\n\n In fact, I gave examples of this and explicitly acknowledged that it was explicitly mentioned in Christianity. And that this credit is undeniable cause and effect.\n But that isn't \"civil rights\".\n \n \n \nAnd what of the (gasp) evangelicals who have recently taken a pro-environmental stance on global warming? Is that not good?\n\n Compare the SCOPE of those \"evangelicals\" to the rest of the Christian community, which includes MANY TIMES MORE christians who oppose an \"environmental stance on global warming\" with almost religious fervor.\n (That is actually something I wanted to bring up, that deserves its own thread. How the \"global warming\" debate takes on such a religious divide in the first place, but I usually chalk it up to stubborn resistance of anything those \"godless liberals\" say, therefore it must be wrong because some \"brands\" of christianity don't like the source...)\n \n But getting back to your comment, THIS is part of what I'm talking about.\n You take an example where SOME people who have a \"christian\" name-tag (evangelical) support it, and you automatically IGNORE the larger number who share that name-tag that OPPOSE it and you ignore that the cause of the support IS NOT BASED on the name-tag...\n That's according to a new report by The Barna Group, which surveys trends among evangelicals -- which it defines as a more doctrinally conservative band among those who define themselves as born-again Christians.\n \n Only 33 percent thought global warming was a major problem, compared with 69 percent in the latter category. Other Christian and non-Christian groups were also more concerned about global warming.http://www.bluegrassreport.org/bluegrass_politics/2007/09/poll-evangelica.html\n \n And a second web-site that shows 62% secular believe man to be the cause of global warming, and 37% white evangelicals with the same view.\n http://pewforum.org/docs/index.php?DocID=153\n \n Your attempt to give credit to evangelicals doesn't make sense.\n It's like trying to give credit to the Hatfield family for fighting for the North in the civil war, when the truth is that you have ONE out of FIVE brothers fighting for the north, and the rest fight for the South!\n \n \n \nThese aren't examples that are 'in spite' of the religion--they are because of the religion: e.g. the teachings of Christ to help the poor and the belief that the environment God has made is in our charge to take care of and protect.\n\n How can you jump from \"civil rights\" to \"helping the poor\"?\n They aren't the same things.\n \n I have already granted that \"helping the poor\" is something you can attribute to the Christian theology.\n But what I ALSO said, which you have failed to even try to comment on, is that other issues like slavery and equal treatment of women have Christianity with more credit for OPPOSING those equal rights than for supporting.\n \n \n \nReligion is like most anything else--it can be used for good or bad. I know there are people here who are pretty bitter toward religion, but like it or not, sometimes things that you view as good come out of it. And it's not exactly fair for people to refuse to give credit where credit is due, yet jump at the chance to condemn it when it can be blamed.\n\n I have already talked about \"giving credit where credit is due\".\n Quite frankly, I think the converse of your statement should be more of an issue for you.\n In the past, you have refused to acknowledge the damage that \"Christianity\" has done to the gay people. You want to \"give credit\" to Christianity, but you refuse to accept blame.",

Christians can't agree on whether or not it's actually Christ's body and blood, or represents it, or is transubstantiated.\n And then you have the VERY real historical dispute on whether or not the bible plays a part in racial equality?\n I can't get past the very real fact that the bible EXPLICITLY TELLS SLAVES how to be GOOD SLAVES.\n So jumping from that to telling us that the bible supports racial equality is unreal.\n \n \n \nHow is that not a part of the civil rights movement? The liberation movement certainly IS a part of the civil rights movement. Frankly, I can't possibly see how you could say otherwise.\n\n Giving to the poor is not a civil rights issue.\n Giving to the poor is not black equality.\n Quit trying to use pronouns to confuse the issue.

Meanwhile, VERY high profile leaders (some of whom you no doubt consider villains who oppose gay rights) are publicly coming out in an environmental stance. We're talking about people like Pat Robertson here.\n\n I would hardly invoke Pat Robertson if I were you, unless you're willing to also associate his stances on \"other\" issues as being \"religious\".\n Would you care to delve into his various positions regarding RACE? Can we automatically associate THOSE with religion as well?\n Or is it just pick-and-choose buffet?\n \n But back to the topic, you are approaching the issue from only one dimension, and attempting to associate \"causality\" based on ONE DIMENSION.\n Likewise, I could observe \"75% who have characteristic X believe in Y\". (What you just did.)\n And then we could loudly proclaim \"Characteristic X causes Y.\" And that would be nonsense.\n \n But then if we REALLY took a step back and looked at how many people who DO NOT have characteristic X, and compare positions on \"Y\", THAT would be a more encompassing analysis.\n And on THIS issue, the fact that evangelicals are LESS LIKELY to go after global warming than their non-evangelical counter-parts CANNOT be overlooked.\n By the above analogy, when 95% who do NOT have characteristic X also believe in Y, one comes to a different conclusion.\n One starts to question if characteristic X HINDERS a belief in Y, cause people are MORE LIKELY to believe in Y WITHOUT X.\n \n And on a final note, have you ever heard of \"Ellison Research\" before?\n http://www.ellisonresearch.com/mission.htm\n Looking at their web-site, they sound more like a P.R. firm, which would make more sense when one also considers that the \"Ellison\" poll flies in the face of numerous other polls on the exact same issue.\n And how much you want to bet that the \"poll\" was commissioned by the \"Evangelical Climate Initiative\"?\n \n If you seriously want to discuss this issue, you have to address the fact that evangelicals are LESS LIKELY to support \"global warming\" defensive action than non-evangelicals.\n \n \n \nLarger #, like 30%, as the poll linked about demonstrates? emoticon_rolleyes \n\n Actually, it was 33%. (From my article at least...)\n \"Only 33 percent (of evangelicals) thought global warming was a major problem...\"\n \n There are numerous polls substantiating my point. The likelihood of an evangelical supporting global warming is LOWER than the likelihood of a NON-evangelical supporting global warming.\n And based on that, it is nonsensical to claim \"evangelical\" as a causal factor for \"supporting global warming\".\n \n Another one:\n \"According to an August 2006 poll by the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion and Public Life, 78 percent of secular Americans had a favorable view of the environmentalist movement, compared to 49 percent of white evangelical Christians.\n Regarding global warming specifically, the poll shows that 25 percent of white evangelicals believe that there is no solid evidence that the earth is getting warmer, compared to 9 percent of secularists\"\n \n http://pewforum.org/docs/index.php?DocID=153\n \n (And note, this poll is a different year than the previous Pew poll, showing the consistency of the evangelicals to be MORE AGAINST global warming.)",

It won't die out till the last homophobe croaks, but I think it is on the way out.\n \n Surveys suggest that Old Christianity, the Christianity that hates gays, is not long for this world. No-one will mourn it. When it kicks the bucket, we will give it a not-so-fond farewell.\n\n \n All you have shown in 38 posts foundit is #1, your complete inability to interpret the word of God as He intended it to be interpreted.

On the other hand, my perspective is not my own but is a reflection of the one true God, the maker of all that is.

My animosity and harsh response toward homosexuality; my lack of tolerance with the sin it represents according to Gods Word has nothing at all to do with my personal concern, care, love and compassion for you and all homosexuals whom I see as lost souls in dire need of salvation and redemption according to the promises God makes to all of His children through His Word, the bible. \n \n According to the bible, if I just accepted your sin as right and normal in spite of it being condemned in the bible, I would be not only betraying you and helping condemn you one day, but I would be betraying God Himself and calling His Holy Word a lie and unreliable. So please don't see the contention and lack of compromise I bring to this forum as an act of hatred for you. No my friend, please see it as an act of love. Because even though I know that i am hated, attacked, condemned and vilified by my fellow members who are secular humanists and atheists, I still stand on principle and without compromise, I share eternal truths with you that lead to agape love, eternal life and personal fellowship with the maker of all that is in time and space.\n \n I know that in ten million years I will be fellowshiping with my Heavenly Father in an unending eternity. The only question I have, is will any of you be there with us?

Must you corrupt every single thought process and philosophy you discuss? By me saying above that gays can be saved, and that Jesus accepts us all where we are at at the time, I am saying that He died for all of us no matter what our personal or predominant sins were. But you must inject this erroneous belief that everyone is saved whether they like it or not which goes against EVERYTHING Jesus or His Gospel teaches. Like any gift that is freely offered, Salvation must be accepted to be received. we must repent which means to turn away from that lifestyle which leads to our destruction.\n \n \n Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\n \n Romans 5:12 Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned\n \n Are we justified when living by the 10 commandments?\n \n Romans 3:20 because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.\n \n See also bible verses ROM 7:5, ROM 7:25, GAL 5:4\n \n \n Then are we doomed?\n \n John 3:36 \"He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.\"\n \n John 3:17 \"For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. 18 \"He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\n \n Romans 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;\n \n Romans 8:1 Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.\n \n See also bible verses IS 1:18, MK 2:5, LK 1:77, LK 7:48-50, JN 5:24, JN 11:25, ACTS 10:43, ACTS 16:31, ROM 1:17, ROM 3:22, GAL 3:26, ROM 10:10-13, ACTS 26:18\n \n \n How come?\n \n John 3:16 \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\n \n Mark 10:45 \"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.\"\n \n Acts 17:30 \"Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent, 31 because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.\"\n \n Romans 5:19 For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.\n \n Romans 5:21 so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n \n 1 Corinthians 15:22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.\n \n Titus 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 12 instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age, 13 looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, 14 who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.\n \n See also bible verses ROM5, ROM 5:15, 1JN 2:2, 1JN 4:9, ROM 3:22-26\n \n \n Isn't this kind of strange?\n \n Acts 13:38 \"Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, 39 and through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things, from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses. 40 \"Therefore take heed, so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon you: 41 `BEHOLD, YOU SCOFFERS, AND MARVEL, AND PERISH; FOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS, A WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.' \"\n \n Act 2:38 Then Peter said to them, \"Repent\", and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\n 1 Corinthians 1:18 For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.\n \n 1 Corinthians 1:21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe. 22 For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom; 23 but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,\n \n 1 Corinthians 1:27 but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong,\n \n \n What should we do then?\n \n Acts 16:30 and after he brought them out, he said, \"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\" 31 They said, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.\"\n \n Mark 1:15 and saying, \"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand;

We then receive His Holy Spirit which indwells us as our Guide and connection to the living God which makes us one with Him. This is the pure and simple gospel of Christ and all of the corrupting that you do to change it to suit your personal preferences wont change that reality. If you lie to yourself about what is true, do you think that changes the truth? Of course it doesn't, but you do it in every debate you participate in.\n \n So tell me Matt, do you wake up each morning and ask the Lord how you can glorify Him with your life? Do you check your actions each and every moment of your life in order to try not to offend a Just and Holy God whom you know died for your sins? Based on what you have ever posted here, I would seriously doubt that you live for anyone other than yourself and what feels good to you. To you, all that matters is satisfying the needs of this corrupted and corruptible flesh that is temporary at best compared to eternal standards that really matter to us as children of God. That is the inevitable truth that you are destined to learn someday Matthew. Whether you realize it or not; we will all know the absolute truth one day. \n \n So if you persist in lying to yourself regarding what makes a true follower of Christ, that is obviously your choice.

Not to fight Bush's war but to defend the rights and freedoms of every person selflessly. Unfourtunately the military isnt so glamourous and as valiant an institution as I once thought and have gone through a lot of suffering and heartache because of it. The point being is I asked god to love me for who I am and if he made me this way and if I love guys which I really do especially my sweet boyfriend, then it's ok. I keep my sexuality to myslef like I dont flaunt it and I dont flaunt my religion. I'm perfectly at ease. I love jesus and I thank him for creating me and loving me for who I am. It's when people take the true nature and teachings of Jesus and twist them for their own personal gain or insecurities and harm others through it is when I have a problem with it. It's wrong.",

   "This is you opinion, one that is opposite to Lutheran teaching BTW. You may have and hold this opinion all you want and I will respect your right to have and even voice this opinion. But the moment you push for, support those your put this opinion into law that the rest of us have to live under is when you give up you righ to have an opinion. \n \n BTW the Lutheran theology teaches that we are saved though grace that no matter what we have done we are all ready saved. There is nothing we can do either way to effect the grace of God. No one has to \"get saved\" or accept Jesus as his/her personal savior because it was already done 2000 years ago on the cross. WE are saved through grace. The big sin is that you are telling Jason that his God given, joyous gift is a sin and something that needs repenting. Shame on you he might as well repent for letting the sun fall on his face or repent that the rain fell to water his garden. God created him gay, blesses his gayness, and Jason has nothing to repent for. If someone has to repent for the way God made then then when are you going to repent for being a heterosexual? Jesus himself said some are born gay.\n \n Matthew 19:11-12\n 11Jesus replied, \"Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. 12For some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.\"\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sq3Hca_21A\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jULRsvRWWoM\n \n So please get off Jasons back with your fundie teaching.\n\n \n Thanks for understanding my issues Matt. I'm glad at least a few people do.",

But listen, We must all travel our own path so I wont bother sharing any unsolicited wisdom with you any further.",

But there are those who would want to cause harm to me and get self gratification through it because I'm gay. However if I may point out that you have shut out persons opinions and their comments on your postings and have made a notion to I think foundit66 that hes getting whats coming to him. \n \n True they may have said some sharp remarks to your opinion but still everyone is entitled to their opinion and right to express it. I'm not saying your a bigot or insulting you I just observe that you become very defensive and almost counter attack towards certain comments. I have my opinions but I never seek to personally hurt or isult someone. I'm just looking out for your credibility on this forum.",
