   "By Ali Davis, Contributing writer 08.01.2009 5:10pm EDT\n News & Politics\n \n A gunman wearing black began shooting at a Tel Aviv gay and lesbian center called Caf\u00e9 Noir Saturday night, killing three people and wounding at least eight more - other reports put the number of wounded as high as 15.\n \n The shooter walked into the center during a meeting for LGBT teens. Most of the victims were very young, and many were not yet out to their families.\n \n Police are searching for the gunman, and believe the incident was a homophobic attack rather than a part of the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflicts.\n \n Tel Aviv has an active LGBT scene, but several conservative groups in Israel frown on homosexuality.\n \n The Jerusalem Post reports that police have ordered the closing of gay clubs all over the city as a safety precaution, and that one of the people killed was a youth counselor.\n \n There is a short version of the story up at Reuters.\n \n A story on Ynet News indicates that the attack took place during a regular meeting for LGBT teenagers. At least one witness says the gunman was masked.",

Our courts have LONG (back to the common law system) utilized motive as a factor in sentencing.\n\n \n I didn't change a thing, JJ's post was clearly about a \"hate crime\". The only reason motive is considered is because judges are given latitude on sentencing within a range prescribed by penal code. This in my opinion is a problem, it leads to judges increasing or decreasing sentences based on their oopinion of the crime. Our penal code should be more stringent in this regard.

This is particularly true within the law of homicide, where murder requires either the intent to kill, a state of mind called malice, or malice aforethought, which may involve an unintentional killing but with a willful disregard for life.Manslaughter - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n We're still talking about the state of mind =< MOTIVE.\n \n \n \nDon't use the term \"people like you\" when you obviously don't know me. I've already said I don't think motive should be used as a factor in sentencing, in any crime.\n\n I use it cause it's 100% accurate.\n I have never seen you speak out against motive being used during sentencing.\n As I mentioned, the practice has a LONG history in the U.S. It is a standard practice.\n Judges use it MORE OFTEN as a standard practice, then they ever use it for \"hate crime\" purposes...\n \n I know what \"you've already said\".\n It doesn't address the issue of WHY you are only seen to \"say\" it when it comes to hate crimes issues, but there is never seen a thread on the HISTORICAL and MUCH MORE COMMON practice which violates your ideology...\n It's a bit like saying \"I don't think neighbors should have fences\", and then you complain about the BLACK neighbor having a fence, as you ignore NUMEROUS other fences in your neighborhood.\n \n \n \nBecause these are two different crimes.

About ten minutes later, he returned to the work area with a brown paper bag in his hand. Upon being asked by his supervisor what was in the bag, he reportedly pulled out a .38 revolver and at close range fatally shot the supervisor twice, once in the upper body and once in the face. Two employees reportedly took the gun away from Bruce Clark and held him down until the police came. Seventy-five postal employees reportedly witnessed the shooting.\n\n \n In ANY case, I brought up the postal worker thing becuase it was the first thing that popped into my mind. IT WAS AN ANALOGY!

Learn to read. And yes I did call them sodomists, becuase that's what they do.\n Learn to read? Oh ok because it came up as a typing error and right clicked it and used the top option.. I can read SoC, I have an above average college reading level so please don;t even try to to insult my intellect...\n \n \n \nGays and lesbians, by definition, do not Follow the Lord's commands.\n Really? Go to soulforce.org if you dare and see there are thousands of gay Christians. And by who's definition? Yours? Well according to your mind choked with delusions of grandeur and self righteousness, I would assume that would be the definition. Not the definition of clergy and ministers who support the LGBT community and embrace us as another one of gods creation.... \n \n \nNo, I am denying hte CLAIM that the murders occured because the victims were gay because we DON'T KNOW the reason for them.\n Yes we do SoC.... Why? Because sadly the LGBT community has been a target of violence and hate for decades.. \n \n \n \n There is no way you could be Christian with your unnatural lifestyle completely in denial of anything Christ-like.\n Actually this may shock you but I am a Christian. I was baptized at age nine of my own will, and I value the teachings of Christ and have accepted him as my lord and saviour. However, I know two sides to the faith and one is that of the original message of Christ which was empowered through his miracles which was love,forgiveness, hope, and the beatitudes.\n \n The other side I have seen is your side and the side of those drunk with power and self infatuation. Those that take the message of Christ and throw it out the window. Those that seek to slander and hurt, and judge. Those that use their so called faith in a corrupted state to demonize and ridicule, to prey upon a group of people they truly know nothing about.\n \n \n \nThis speaks quite clearly as to what you really are, and that, my friend, is not Christian.\n Well then judge lest ye be judged.... I may have a blunt attitude and even a rude demeanour, but that is because I have developed a catalyst to the sneers, and the insults, and the lies about me and other gays and lesbians. It is because I don't play games SoC and I know what it's like fighting for your life because I had to.\n \n Because I know that I could have ended up like SN Provost or Matthew Sheppard. I could have ended up dead. Dead because of blind ignorant hate becuase I am gay. Because I am slightly different yet not really at all. I love. I feel. I have compassion. I have hopes and dreams just like any other human alive. And thats the one connection you fail to see. The one connection that has been removed from your realization. were all Human. Were all here. Now struggling to make sense of this chaotic universe. To answer the why question.\n \n Thats why I don't judge others beliefs. Thats why I don;t call judism wrong or hinduism or islam wrong. They are all beliefs that are tied to one simple realization. That humans have hope. And it is hope that spurs us on in our daily lives.\n \n That things will get better, that tomorrow will shine a little brighter. Thats why I fight against the lies and the ignorance and the sheer indomitrable walls people put up against us. Because I do have hope that one day I can walk down the street holding my husbands hand and not be harassed. Or that I can even marry! \n \n Here is an excerpt from a speech given by Harvey Milk:\n \n You see there is a major difference-and it remains a vital difference-between a friend and a gay person, a friend in office and a gay person in office. Gay people have been slandered nationwide. We've been tarred and we've been brushed with the picture of pornography. In Dade County, we were accused of child molestation. It's not enough anymore just to have friends represent us. No matter how good that friend may be.\n \n The black community made up its mind to that a long time ago. That the myths against blacks can only be dispelled by electing black leaders, so the black community could be judged by the leaders and not by the myths or black criminals. The Spanish community must not be judged by Latin criminals or myths. The Asian community must not be judged by Asian criminals or myths. The Italian community should not be judged by the mafia myths. And the time has come when the gay community must not be judged by our criminals and myths.\n \n Like every other group, we must be judged by our leaders and by those who are themselves gay, those who are visible. For invisible, we remain in limbo-a myth, a person with no parents, no brothers, no sisters, no friends who are straight, no important positions in employment. A tenth of a nation supposedly composed of stereotypes and would-be seducers of children-and no offense meant to the stereotypes. But today, the black community is not judged by its friends, but by its black legislators and leaders. And we must give people the chance to judge us by our leaders and legislators. A gay person in office can set a tone, can command respect not only from the larger community, but from the young people in our own community who need both examples and hope.\n \n The first gay people we elect must be strong. They must not be content to sit in the back of the bus. They must not be content to accept pablum. They must be above wheeling and dealing. They must be-for the good of all of us-independent, unbought. The anger and the frustrations that some of us feel is because we are misunderstood, and friends can't feel that anger and frustration. They can sense it in us, but they can't feel it. Because a friend has never gone through what is known as coming out. I will never forget what it was like coming out and having nobody to look up toward. I remember the lack of hope-and our friends can't fulfill that.\n \n I can't forget the looks on faces of people who've lost hope. Be they gay, be they seniors, be they black looking for an almost-impossible job, be they Latins trying to explain their problems and aspirations in a tongue that's foreign to them. I personally will never forget that people are more important than buildings. I use the word \"I\" because I'm proud. I stand here tonight in front of my gay sisters, brothers and friends because I'm proud of you. I think it's time that we have many legislators who are gay and proud of that fact and do not have to remain in the closet. I think that a gay person, up-front, will not walk away from a responsibility and be afraid of being tossed out of office. After Dade County, I walked among the angry and the frustrated night after night and I looked at their faces. And in San Francisco, three days before Gay Pride Day, a person was killed just because he was gay. And that night, I walked among the sad and the frustrated at City Hall in San Francisco and later that night as they lit candles on Castro Street and stood in silence, reaching out for some symbolic thing that would give them hope. These were strong people, people whose faces I knew from the shop, the streets, meetings and people who I never saw before but I knew. They were strong, but even they needed hope.\n \n And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant on television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and more offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.\n \n So if there is a message I have to give, it is that if I've found one overriding thing about my personal election, it's the fact that if a gay person can be elected, it's a green light. And you and you and you, you have to give people hope. Thank you very much.\n \n ",
