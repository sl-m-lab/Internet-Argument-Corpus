Our own limited brand, maybe, but nothing like what you see in Scandinavia. And that's probably best for America.",

Just like socialist Europe, they are going broke. Socialism depends on large income taxes to fund social programs. Try the same taxes here in the USA and people will get thier guns and shoot all the politicians trying to tax them. Remember this country was born over a fight over taxes.",

The next thing you know the illegals will have the right to vote! Grey Davis was a huge mistake and will go down as an absolutely horrible leader for what he has done both now and before his recall.\n \n Californias attempt as socialism is an example to us all though. We cannot allow ourselves to go the way of Europe because we will end up in the same situation they are in. The democrats have to get their heads on straight and the conservatives need to stop their excessive spending programs as well. We need to avoid another California or Europe incident.",

I'd like to know why he thought DC was very socialist and how Beijing or Havana could have been less socialist than DC when they are communist.",
