   "Hey Bassman, I think you have the week schedule up numberwise. Everything I've seen suggest that the up coming weekend would be week 8. I think it was Week 5 and 6 were just 2 days apart from eachother. Week 5 had the week of a Friday and week 6 had that following Sunday. So I think the weeks are ahead of schedule for where the NFL is currently playing.",

   "This will come as a great surprise, but I am picking my growing ever more beloved by the week, DAA BEARZZZ.\n \n They play Detroit this week and the Lions beat the Bears a few short weeks ago in Soldier Field but the Lions are hurting bigtime with injuries right now. Not AS bad as the GB Packers after losing Yaah-mon Green, but close to it.\n \n \n Speaking of the Pack, it was soooooo damn sweeeeet to see ex-Bear kicker Edinger nail that 56 yarder that won the game for Minnisoda!\n \n Living near the Illinois-Wisconsin border is very interesting when football season rolls around. The Bear-Packer fan (mostly friendly) animosity cannot be understated as the fan base is roughly split down the middle.\n \n In other words, I've finally been able to give the pompous Packer fans at work a whole lot of :xcensored recently!!!\n \n \n BEARZZZ  35.....Lions 3.\n \n Heheheee, the BEST defense in the league will allow the Lions to save face with a field goal.",
