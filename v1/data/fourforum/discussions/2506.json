   "Scripture says, \"It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples. He said to them, \"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\" And they {said} to him, \"No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.\" And he said, \"Into what then were you baptized?\" And they said, \"Into JOHN'S BAPTISM.\" Paul said, \"John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\" When they heard this, they were BAPTIZED in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the HOLY SPIRIT CAME ON THEM, and they {began} speaking with tongues and prophesying.\" Acts 19:1-6 NASB (Caps for emphasis).\n \n Paul writes, \"{There is} one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, ONE BAPTISM, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.\" Eph. 4:5+6.\n \n Scripture is clearly describing three separate baptisms in the first series of verses in Acts 19:1-6. These events become more dramatic, when we realize that they occur about six years after Peter and Paul's meeting in Jerusalem (Acts 15), or in about 56 Ad.. That means that these Kingdom Disciples traveled the countryside for about 25 years with only the 'baptism of John.' Then, after hearing the good news about Jesus Christ and His coming, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus (second baptism). And yet, they did not receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Then, when Paul laid hands upon them, they all received the gift of the Holy Spirit and began speaking in tongues. \n \n The writer of Acts is quoting Paul here in describing three individual baptisms. This is in full agreement with Christ's Great Commission commands to the Kingdom Disciples. \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the FATHER and the SON and the HOLY SPIRIT, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\" Matt. 28:19+20. These three separate baptisms are divided thus:\n \n 1. Of the Father: John's Baptism (sent by God; John 1:6) is the baptism of the Father. As it is written, \"I did not recognize Him, but HE WHO SENT ME to baptize in water said to me, 'He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.' John 1:33.\n \n 2. Of the Son: Paul said, \"John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus. WHEN THEY HEARD THIS, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Acts 19:4+5.\n \n 3. Of the Holy Spirit: And when Paul had LAID HIS HANDS UPON THEM, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they {began} speaking with tongues and prophesying.\" Acts 19:6. \n \n To be absolutely certain that the reader can visualize these three separate baptisms of the kingdom, Scripture has provided you with this excellent example:\n \n \"But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike. Even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed. Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John, who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit. For He had NOT YET fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. THEN they {began} laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.\" Acts 8:12-17.\n \n While our first example (Acts 19:1-6) was about men who knew only of the baptism of John, these people had received the first two baptisms of the kingdom (in water in the name of Jesus). They had to wait on Peter and John to come and lay hands on them to receive the 'gift of the Holy Spirit.' These two examples clearly demonstrate that it was possible for a period to pass between these baptisms of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Since this is true, then it should be obvious to even the casual reader that our New Testament describes more than a single baptism. However, how can this be true, when Paul says that there is only 'one baptism?' Eph. 4:5. \n \n Is there just one baptism as Paul tells the Ephesians, or are there three baptisms as Paul tells the Kingdom Disciples in Acts 19? The answer is that there are three baptisms for the Kingdom Disciples and just one baptism for the members of the body of Christ. You will find just one baptism of the Holy Spirit described in Paul's Gentile Epistles (Romans - Philemon). The remainder of the New Testament describes the three baptisms for the Kingdom. Paul writes to Gentiles, \"In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of {God's own} possession, to the praise of His glory.\" Eph. 1:13+14.\n \n The Holy Spirit 'seals' us into Christ the moment we are obedient to the message of truth - the gospel of our salvation. \"For even as the body is one and {yet} has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many.\" 1Cor. 12:12-14. And also, \"For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.\" Gal. 3:26+27.\n \n Under Paul's Gospel (Rom. 2:16, 16:25, etc.), we are baptized into the body of Christ on the cross at Calvary the moment we believe. It is through the 'power of the gospel' (Rom. 1:16+17) that we become active participants in His death, burial and resurrection (See Romans 6:3+4). Those words take us back to the 'cross' and not to the Jordan River. As members of His body, we died with Him on the cross, were buried in His tomb and raised with Him to be seated in the heavenly (See Eph. 2:4-7). \n \n Paul's one baptism into His body is nothing like the three Kingdom baptisms. They are to be understood totally separate from each other. Paul is seen preaching the three baptisms to the Kingdom disciples in Acts 19, because he preached both the gospel of the kingdom AND the gospel of the grace of God (read very carefully Paul's words in Acts 20:20-28). Luke's slant in Acts is in the direction of the three baptisms of the Kingdom, because this account to Theophilus is a continuation of the Gospel of Luke concerning the Kingdom (compare Luke 1:3 and Acts 1:1).\n \n To apply these things to our seeming contradiction: There is one baptism for the members of the body of Christ today. Those who seek to enter the Kingdom of God on earth as Disciples, in the coming Kingdom Dispensation, shall be baptized thrice in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",
