Like the Armenian genocide by the Turks. Yeah, we really hear about that a lot in schools now.\n Pograms happened before this, murders. No one batted a freaking eye.\n Laws even existed after WWII in some US communities prohibiting Jews from buying land. \n The endemic hatred of the Jews is well documented through out the ages.\n \n If it isn't for some bleeding hearts, 'awareness' of genocides wouldn't exist.\n As it stands, little is even done now to prevent them or stop them.\n \n Silly thing is, after the Holocaust, only the Jewish peoples plight was told with any zeal. \n Countless more were killed by Nazis than 'Jews'. Just not with same zeal and desire for a 'final solution'...and you only get a need for a final solution if you think you have a persistant problem...that all over solutions haven't resolved.\n And it wasn't really a religious issue with them so much as a racial issue. Non-practicing Jews were killed also. However, those Jehovah's Witnesses who recanted their faiths were freed.\n \n But, yeah, some areas were declared Juden Frei. IIRC one of the Baltic countries had their Jewish population exterminated. And following the war, many places remained free for years. Even the attitudes of Germans following the war wasn't changed to be friendly to them. Schindler (the one they made the movie about) recieved a lot of antimosity when he returned to his homeland.\n And, for the life of me, I think the JW's are still banned in Germany...or is it just the Scientologist...",

Meaning, if you are harming another through your action without them being a threat to you in any way, then you have done wrong and perhaps should take a look at your motivations. \n \n Society has every right and even the responsibility to make rules that call for criminal punishment of murderers, child molestors, and drunk drivers among many others. However, society has taken a turn for the surreal when it attempts to legislate what someone may or may not do based on the individuals sexual preferrence and how that ties into the majority of societies religious beliefs. Again, it goes back to who is actually doing harm to others. In the same respect, anyone who enjoys a private religious belief without using it to suppress or harm another (even though they may not like gays or support gay rights issues) should have their privacy respected. \n \n If someone's beliefs and preferrences do not harm anyone else, then society needs to mind it's own business. \n \n If someone's beliefs tell them that it is OK to place people in ovens, society has the right and responsibility to stop them.",
