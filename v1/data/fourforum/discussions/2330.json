No means of support if she continues pregnancy and forced to live on the street (parents couldn't bear the shame and ousted her)?\n \n How healthy is \"healthy\"? No physical deformities but mentally impaired? Healthy mind but impaired motor skills? Missing an arm? Are you \"pro-kill\" if there are severe deformities?

Secondly, it is not fair to the child to have to live with the stigma of being the product of a rapists actions.\n\n \n Careful with \"fair\". Different people have different ideas of fair. I, for example, don't think it's fair for a 16 year old girl to have to drop out of college to have a child.\n \nIncest? Here's the problem with incest. History of these type actions have shown severe genetic problems and possibly mutations. The family gene pool is not meant to mix. \n\n \n Depends on how closely they're related. Why is that the issue though? If the parents love the child, is it the governments job to tell someone that they cannot have a child, simply because of an increased risk of genetic problems? There are plenty of people out there who have hereditary diseases that have a significant chance to be passed on. They aren't denied the right to have children.\n \n\n Impaired by drugs or alcohol?

Use just a 'tad' of common sense once in while.\n\n \n True, if a drunk driver irresponsibly drinks and commits a crime, they are held responsible and is punished by revoking their freedom for a time. If a woman drinks irresponsibly and gets pregnant, her freedom is revoked for about 20 years. \n \n Wait a minute, what's wrong with this? Oh yeah, sex isn't a crime. Why do you see fit to punish the woman for it?\n \n Having an abortion is being being responsible for your actions. Being irresponsible would be to disregard how you being pregnant will affect your and other's future. If you feel you can handle what will come, then a child can be a wonderful thing :) If you do not feel you can financially, emotionally, physically and mentally handle being pregnant or having a child, then stopping the pregnancy should be a choice.\n \n[\n Birth control failure? I can't believe I need to address this, but ok. On the birth control packaging, it states that the birth control is not 100% effective. Therefore, if you're going to use birth control, you are accepting the risks involved.\n\n \n My SO knows a girl who has tried every form of birth control there is, and has gotten pregnant 5 times. It is not 100% effective. The only 100% effective form is abstinance, and to expect that is to not be very realistic about human nature and society in general.\n \n So is using birth control irresponsible now as well? You're living in a pipe-dream if you believe this.\n \n\n Health? You bring up an interesting point as far as the health aspect of what I said. What I meant was that the baby was not going to come out mentally handicapped.\n\n \n But mentally handicapped children are worth less than the rest of us? You have to explain why some zygotes are inviolate and others are able to be aborted morally.\n \n \n\n Now, as far as my forum signature, if you take a closer and more analytical look, I never said that Chappaquiddick Ted Kennedy was a terrorist, although I do think that can be debated.

Now, the whole Clinton's Watergate argument, how are terrorists involved in that at all, directly or indirectly?\n\n \n You sig implies that because he said the something similar to a terrorist, he must be a terrorist. Since you include that he's a democrat in the same place as you identified the terrorist, you imply that democrats are terrorists.\n \n Since many people called the Monica scandal \"Clinton's watergate\", I'm sure some terrorists did too. Since I, too, just called it \"Clinton's watergate\" I said the same thing a terrorist did. Does that make me a terrorist?",

It didn't fit with what you had already disclosed to us.\n \n\n And what if were planning to make it with every guy I meet? What's it to ya'? You're real motives for being pro-life are showing once again.\n\n Really?! Pray tell, what are they? And I hope they are more accurate than your assessment of Catholicism's views on sex. :)\n \n\n It is my body JP. I chose to get my tubes tied. I may choose to have sex again - a little or a lot. I may not. Why does that have you all in knots? You just hate that a woman took control of her body. Admit it.\n\n \n It's not my tubes that are in knots about this, it's yours. \n My plumbing works just fine, thank you. :) \n \n \n emoticon_xgood",

It's not that people shouldn't have sex if they don't want children. It's that they should always accept that as a possibility.\n\n \n People should assume responsibility. If they find they are pregnant, they should be responsible and decide if they're ready to have a child. Idealy, they should do that before, as they should use protection.

Perhaps the woman did not want a child, and hated and resented the pregnancy and the law that required her to continue it. Perhaps her view didn't change and she ended up hating the child and abusing it as it grew older. There are as many different combinations of views as there are people to have them. You cannot know how a woman will view her pregnancy or the child that will come about because of it (barring accidents and miscarriage).\n \n Certainly the child physiologically changes the moment of birth.

Since human life is value neutral, and the killing of unborn children does not lead into social collapse or danger, why oppose it? \n \n \n \n I would advise against an abortion because I would value the chance to raise my children, to know and to love them. If others would not value that chance, then it is far from me to impose it upon them.\n\n \n I think you just left yourself and the pro-choice movement wide open for hysterical condemnation. You might want to prepare yourself for that. I, quite frankly, do not think for a second that your statements here represent the mindset of the average abortion rights supporter but that is what will be claimed by the oppostion.",

Are we devaluing human life step by step?\n \n \nKilling of unborn children, with the proviso that the rest of the laws society hs agreed upon (freedom from coercion, etc...) does not negatively impact the way in which the rest of society lives. It sets no precedent for the killing of other members of society.\n\n See above. Why has the law granted you a right to life? Abortion negatively affects about 4,000 beings a day that would interact in our society.",

I have a problem with the idea of 'alienable rights' in the first place (because they are not, really just ideals) and interpretting the constitution almost aliong teh same lines as the word of god seems wrong. It is a legal tool for filling in the gaps where the boundaries of laws become shaky or when creating laws. However you have to recognise that it is not perfect and there are exceptions to the rules they make. \n Irrelevant as the consitution only applys to US citizens (I think, dpon't you have to be born on US soil or to american parents to count as a citizen), even if all people is what it refers to it is still debateble whether a embryo counts. \n \n \n\n I can say that a child is a consequence that is not on the same level as an STD. I can say that this consequence must be lived with because it is life itself. I can say that taking this human life is wrong. An STD does not compare. That sounds more like \"rationale reasoning\" than saying that treating an STD is the same as killing a fetus.\n Not sure if it was you who made the orginal point. I also see a fetus as a very different thing from an STD. However if you are using the reasoning that pregnancy must be lived with due to it being a consquence of sex, then this applies also to STDs. Being against abortions because you beleive the embryo should have the same rights as a born person is an entirely different debate.\n \n \n\n Must the rights of one override the other or can they co-exist? \n They can coexist, but still one's rights will override the others - if the mother's life is in danger then by anyones values the fetus's are forfiet. If abortion is criminalised then the fetus rights overide that of the mothers (all except right to life). This automatically shows that the rights mentioned in the constitution are far from inalienable - life overides liberty and happiness.\n \n \n\n If one must remove the function then that tells us that the function is inherent as I said.\n Think of it as riding a car. The purpose of a car is of a means of transport from one place to another. This function is removed if you are just driving or pleasure or in a race. If racing cars for pleasure without actually arriving at a destination is OK, then why not sex for pleasure without actually resulting in a baby.\n \n \n\n Can you explain to me more fully what a merely potential human is?\n \n How is this \"merely potential human\" different than a \"fully formed fetus?\"\n Potential person I mean, you have to remember that just because someone is pro abortion, it doesn't mean at any stage. A potential person is something that has the potential to become a person (best defintion I can come up with is a human organism possessing a personality, able to make concious choices.) but is not one yet. A developing embryo has no functioning brain and is not concious in anyway. It is not choosing to do anything as it doesn't have this ability yet. A fully formed fetus is able to do this and shows concious brain activity, which is the one thing that makes it different from any other thing. If you are trying to define what makes a person special it is the mind, before this has formed then there is no way to define the embryo/fetus in such a way that it doesn't include something blatently not a person - a cancer cell if we are dealing on a DNA being different and independant orgnanism defition or eggs, sperm and even just cells if we are dealing with something that merely has the potential to grow to being a adult human. The only thing that the fetus crosses over with if we set the defintion as being a human with a concious mind is an adult human (admittedly there is a problem with coma victims, but they are often either classified as dead or you could have it being 'has or had a concious mind')",

The result is relative ignorance and confusion as kids get their info from various media sources (TV, music, movies, ect..), school (sex ed, classmates), politicians, pundits, health organizations and religious groups. The message from all of these sources are diverse and often contradictory: \"do it anytime you want, don't do it, wait until marriage, wait until you're ready, use protection, protection is not 100% effective, you'll go to hell if you do, it's not psycologically healthy to abstain.\" Is it any surprise that unplanned pregnancy, abortion, out of wedlock births and AIDS are serious national problems?",

   "I am pro-life and I could not agree more. However, I wonder just how committed the average person is to eliminating the root causes of unplanned, unwanted pregnancy. Human nature, being what it is, predisposes people to desire sex at an early age and the job of parents is made infinitely more difficult by the fact that our culture is saturated with images of sex, particularly casual sex. Parents become their own worst enemy when they become intimidated by the very subject and refuse to talk their children about it. The result is relative ignorance and confusion as kids get their info from various media sources (TV, music, movies, ect..), school (sex ed, classmates), politicians, pundits, health organizations and religious groups. The message from all of these sources are diverse and often contradictory: \"do it anytime you want, don't do it, wait until marriage, wait until you're ready, use protection, protection is not 100% effective, you'll go to hell if you do, it's not psycologically healthy to abstain.\" Is it any surprise that unplanned pregnancy, abortion, out of wedlock births and AIDS are serious national problems?\n\n \n No question it's a huge under-taking. And I most certainly don't have all the answers. It certainly begins with education. I have heard about classes where kids have to take care of an electronic doll, or egg, or something - to try and teach them the realities of the committment in raising kids. I think more information helps. Have kids talk to people who have had to raise babies too young, or who have had to go through a pregnancy, or go through an abortion. Have them talk to people with AIDS. We need to be realistic as well. All the education in the world is never going to stop sex altogether, so they also need to be aware of and have access to birth control. I know some feel that sends a mixed message, but it's better than having those who are gonna do it anyway, do it unprotected.\n \n I think we need to send a different message to girls. Right now they are raised to have men at the center of their lives. That will one day lead to sex. It's toally pervasive. Young women are generally asked about their love lives before their accomplishments (got a boyfriend? are you seeing anyone? are you married yet?). Every magazine cover from 17 to Vogue is littered with ways of how to find, catch, and keep a man. Women are bred to treat a relationship with a man as their crowning acheivement. \n \n Now there is nothing wrong with healthy relationships, love or marriage (or even sex for that matter), but we need to teach our girls, as we teach our boys, that it is a part of life, not their whole life, and that there is plenty of power and success to be had in celibacy and in being single and responsible.\n \n And in the end, there will still be unplanned pregnancy and the possible choice of abortion, which tend to cast into three categories - medical, rape/incest, or birth control. That is a HUGE over simplification. Pregnancy is more than an inconvenience and the reasons to terminate are vast - finances, medical care, age, school, domestic violence, and the list goes on. How can we help these women get through their pregnancies successfully without destroying their lives or rights and without demonizing them? And if they want to be mothers, how can we help with that? (Not just talking welfare here, for THAT is a good idea being run really inneffectively right now.)\n \n However, out-lawing abortion won't help. It won't support women. It won't create healthy pregnancies or babies or create responsible choices. It will simply lead women in desperate situations to take desperate actions. And it will not stop abortion, just safety.\n \n I want abortion to be reduced as much as possible, too. But simply outlawing it won't do that. It's like putting a band-aid on a gun shot wound.",

   "\"Keep in mind, I am speaking about a woman that has NOT been a victim of rape or incest, WILL NOT suffer fatal consequences because of the birth of the baby, and the baby will be healthy.\"\n \n How someone became pregnant in the first place is irrelevant to both sides of the debate. Either you believe the fetus has a right to life because it is a living thing deserving of such a right or you believe that women have sovereignty over their bodies. A woman didn't get the right to abortion because she was raped and a fetus didn't get a right to life because a prostitute conceived it.",

   "Of course we do. We also know that bringing it up in abortion arguments is just a tactic for emotional response. Late-term abortions are RARE. Something like 1%-2% of the abortions performed, they are generally done in dire medical situations and are now illegal to do unless it is such a situation. \n \n \n \n GEEEEEEZ, so mentioning partial birth abortion is a tactic to elicit an emotional response, but rape, incest, etceters isn't? Talk about a double standard",

   "The baby has no say in it at this time because it is incable of even concieving of anything, its neural system isn't fully devolped and it can not think. Far as I am concernced this is the important thing, who cares what a things DNA is, what is important is who it is and you need a brain/mind for this. Until then it is really no different from any other peice of dumb flesh.\n\n \n LMAO, so a 1 day old baby INSTANTLY has the ability to think and \"conceive\" of something? I've had three and honestly, I don't buy the \"romanticized\" idea that the baby looks lovingly into it's mothers eyes. It's on instinct mode and wants food, it isn't cognitively thinking that the mother is giving it food",
