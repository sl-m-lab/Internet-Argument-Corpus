   "Hugo Chavez is the democratically elected president of Venezuela.\n \n It's disheartening that all the coverage of Pat Robertson's statements never cleared up this fact.\n \n At one point Chavez was a soldier. He and his associates tried to overthrow a corrupt government and failed, twice. After being released from prison, he must have realized that a military coup wouldn't work, so he turned to politics.\n \n Chavez has immense popular support in Venezuela, and that must be why he was elected as president twice. Poll numbers go up and down as to whether he is doing a good job or keeping his campaign promises, but so what?\n \n He was still elected as president.\n \n The results were contested? Hmm, well, they were less contested than what happened here in 2000 and 2004.\n \n And people complain that he is anti-Bush, and he is opposed to the US government. Well, how would you feel if Bush encouraged a military coup against you and supported the military junta that would replace you?\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1925236.stm\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Chavez",
