   "You're being mislead on job creation!\n \n Think we're still down 2 million jobs? Think again.\n \n The standard economic survey that we use to come up with job figures barely takes into account self-emplyment.\n \n The survey that does? Well... surprise, that one shows that in the past three years 2 million jobs have been created...\n \n It's time for the Labor Department to change it's way of counting. I think they will... why else did Bush come out with a figure of almost three million jobs over the year?",

Even during this economic bounce I cannot see the guiding reasoning behind it from where I stand as more companies continue to close their doors.",

I would be interested in hearing more.\n \n I can tell you, though, why they barely count self employment.....It is because self employment generally lasts less than a year before you bankrupt. Over 90 percent of small businesses don't make it through the first year, and 45 percent of the remaining don't live through the second.",

The standard economic survey (or, at least the one approved by the SBA) takes full accounting of self employment.\n \n If anything, this would bias the results, or at least the desired implications of the results, in the other direction. A little more looking into the question of self employment shows that not only do the majority of small businesses fail the first year, the owner/operators loose money (end up with a negative balance sheet). This is far worse than not working!\n \n Be VERY careful about believing what you see on TV, regardless of where it comes from, unless you can independantly verify the data.",
