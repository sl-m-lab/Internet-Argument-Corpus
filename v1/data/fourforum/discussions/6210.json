Move over, $7,000 coffeepots! Stand aside, $400 hammers! We now have the $792 doormat!\" \n \n \"The limousine is the ultimate ego trip, the supreme sign of success. It shouts: \"Hey, this guy is really and truly Mr Big.\" \n \n \"Power always has to be kept in check; power exercised in secret, especially under the cloak of national security, is doubly dangerous.\" \n \n \"The biggest danger for a politician is to shake hands with a man who is physically stronger, has been drinking and is voting for the other guy.\" \n \n \"I have spent my career trying to get the congress to spend the taxpayers money as they would their own. I have failed.\"\n \n Dono",

History teaches us that it is often easier to make war than peace. This administration is just learning that lesson right now. The President began this mission with very vague objectives and lots of unanswered questions. A month later, these questions are still unanswered. There are no clarified rules of engagement. There is no timetable. There is no legitimate definition of victory. There is no contingency plan for mission creep. There is no clear funding program. There is no agenda to bolster our over-extended military. There is no explanation defining what vital national interests are at stake. There was no strategic plan for war when the President started this thing, and there still is no plan today\"\n --Rep Tom Delay (R-TX)\n \n \"Victory means exit strategy, and it's important for the President to explain to us what the exit strategy is.\"\n --Governor George W. Bush (R-TX)\n \n I thought the exit strategy was to stay the course.",

   "Speaking of these anti-war quotes from Republicans, please take a look at this video clip from Fox News.\n \n It think it fully illustrates the way Republicans cannot win on this issue.\n \n http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/08/12.html#a4430\n \n http://movies.crooksandliars.com/John-Gibson-smears-Cindy.wmv\n \n Ok, listen carefully to what the commentator says about Cindy Sheehan.\n \n He says:\n \n 1. She's associating with \"far left\" and \"radical\" groups, anti-war groups.\n \n 2. These groups are against all US military actions, such as the war in Bosnia.\n \n \n \n This means......\n \n The Republican party is a far left, radical anti-war group!\n \n (I also think it's funny when he says \"It's just a lot of groups, so it makes it seem like there are a lot of people who feel this way.\" Gee, ya think?)",
