   "The power that OS believes in is the power of the gun psychotics.\n\n \n To fully appreciate how contemptible the left is, you merely have to note that whenever people oppose any item on Obama's radical agenda, liberals follow Jimmy Carter's lead and label them racists. The majority of voters cast ballots for Obama last November and now, apparently millions of them, according to recent polls, are suffering from buyer's remorse. Is it really possible that they simply failed to notice on Election Day that they were voting for a black man? \n \n There are those who wonder why lefties are so often drawn to tyrants. Why is it, normal people ask, that those on the left looked so fondly on Stalin; why they adorn their walls with Che Guevara posters; why they wore those dopey caps with the red star and carted around Mao's Little Red Book in the '60s; why Sean Penn went to Iraq to show his solidarity with Saddam Hussein; why, to this day, they will flock to Cuba and kiss Castro's behind; why they will side with Hamas and Hezbollah, while accusing Israel of crimes against humanity; and why Thomas Friedman of the N.Y. Times will feel free to extol the virtues of one-party autocracies such as China. \n \n The answer is that they identify with tyrants. They don't oppose gulags on principle; they simply don't wish to be sent to one. That doesn't mean they wouldn't like to run one. They also have a soft spot for dictators because they, themselves, are miserable excuses for human beings who look down on the masses as being ignorant, religious peons who, in a just world, would exist only to serve as organ donors. \n \n Of course the fall back position is to isolate, ridicule and demonize. Sorry baby you lose yet again.\n \n ",
