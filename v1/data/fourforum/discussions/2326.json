   "here is the problem, farming is a business, so, if somehow peta had their way and the eating of meat and the wearing of animal products were abolished tommorrow then what would happen to the cows in the field, they would be slaughtered immediatly, just like useless machinery is sold for its metals the livestock would be composted. gruesome yes, but cows are expensive to keep alive, and no matter what they tell you cows are the dumbest animal on earth (though ive heard sheep are dumber)\n \n you might say that no, that wouldnt happen, cause they would also pass within that law something that says you cant kill them for any reason, fine, we stop cutting steers, stop vaccinating any of them, restrict their pasture and release wolves and predators into the area, same effect, just more prolonged\n \n you might also be saying that it will not happen overnight, gradual phasing out, fine, phase it out, there will be less and less cows, instead of having a short life (their words not mine) they would have none\n \n now, on to dairy, according to milksucks.com\n [quote]\n With genetic manipulation and intensive production technologies, it is common for modern dairy cows to produce 100 pounds of milk a day- 10 times more than they would produce in nature. To keep milk production as high as possible, farmers artificially inseminate cows every year. \n [end quote]\n \n ok, as to genetic manipulation, bla, its called selective breeding and has been used for as long as humans had livestock, its simple, breed one good milk cow to a bull born to another good milk cow, get one very good milk cow, and the process goes on, second, 100 lbs of milk/day, no idea, but i suppose it is possible, artificial insemination has nothing to do with milk production, its a cheaper, more succesful way to impregnate cattle, and as to being pregnant every year, so, thats what they do in the wild, as do most wild animals\n \n haha, just saw one that said bull calves are considered useless and a vet wont be called if they are sick, rofl, bull calves are castrated and sold, $400 depending on weight and age, they are prolly 52% of what winds up on your plate, you may cry \"castrate!! ahhhhh, why!!!\" well, cattle and other wild animals do not experience sex the way we do, only when the female goes into heat can the male go after them, its more mechanical less intimate, besides, if left uncut these bulls grow up beating the snot out of eachother and mating with relatives, creating inbred cattle, even stupider than normal cattle. also, a bulls flesh is too tough to eat. think of it like fixing your cat\n though they are right in one way, not many calla a vet, the vet bill runs higher than the calf, but we do medicate them, usually before the problems begin, vaccinate (you think your kids hate needles, try sticking a 300lb calf with its head caught in a gate)\n \n thats enough for now, maybe more later, or ask me questions",

   "mathurin,\n \n Your info is correct, I have a lot of farm experience and cows can most certainly produce 100lbs/day. And I actually know of cows producing 150lbs/day for an entire year! And I would have no idea why anyone would be against artificial insemination (A.I.), it is very beneficial for the farmer and for the cows themselves. Using a.i. allows the farmer to not keep dangerous bulls that continue to kill farm workers every year. It also keeps the cows safer from bulls mounting them and basically breaking the cows legs and tearing muscles (I've seen bones pop out from bulls being too heavy). It also eliminates STD's!\n \n One thing I would have to say against what you posted is that I have no idea what to debate on. Are you debating for farming in general, raising cattle, that cows are dumb? Make sure to give it a clear-cut topic of debate and let's get this ball rolling.",
