(No slur on librarians, I know some who are fine people, including a wealthy one, just a comparison for the thread)\n \n As to Mrs. Kerry's tax filing extension, that's available to any and all taxpayers. All one does is pay the taxes due and request an automatic extension for filing. And that extension can, with reasonable cause, be again extended all the way into October.\n\n \n Along with some others here, you have missed the point. I know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons.\n \n I don't really care how much money they have. More power to them for being filthy rich.\n \n A candidate for President is supposed to reveal his (and spouse's) tax returns. Teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention. Why?  Is there anything to hide that would hurt Kerry's chances of even being nominated?\n \n This has nothing to do with the average citizen.",

   "First of all, do you really think there's anything at this point that would derail Kerry's nomination? Remember, Democrats nominate the Democratic candidate and they usually don't consult with Republicans beforehand. Nothing so far has had a nickel's worth of difference on Kerry's popularity within his party. I would think Republicans would jockey to maintain his nomination, otherwise the Democrats might bring Bill Clinton back for another landslide election victory. Look at the flip side, Bush will end his term with record deficits, a poor job record, and a meaningless war that has cost us hundreds of billions with no end in sight and he's a shoe in for the Republican nomination. Obviously, as a country, we don't seem to be that selective with our elected officials. Now, getting back to the taxes, since it's mainly Republicans asking for them, I'm guessing she'll wait as long as legally possible! ;)",
