   "I now support full marriage equality - Louis J. Marinelli\nHaving spent the last five years putting all of my political will, interest and energy into fighting against the spread of same-sex marriage as if it were a contagious disease, I must admit that it is hard for me to put the following text into words let alone utter them with my own voice.\n \n Whether it is an issue of disbelief, shame or embarrassment, the one thing that is for sure is that I have come to this point after several months of an internal conflict with myself. That conflict gradually tore away at me until recently when I was able to for the first time simply admit to myself that I do in fact support civil marriage equality.\n \n While I have come to terms with this reality internally, speaking about it, even with the closest members of my family, has proven to be something difficult for me to do.\n \n In short, if there is an issue of disbelief surrounding my newfound support for civil marriage equality, it is disbelief from those who surround me. If there is an issue of shame, it is a result of acknowledging the number of people I have targeted, hurt and oppressed. And if there is an issue of embarrassment, its roots lie in the face-to-face encounters I have had and expect to have with those with whom I once toiled over this very contentious issue.\n \n I understand that those whom I approach now are well within their right to disbelieve and question me and my motives. I accept that is the result of what I have done over the past few years and would therefore like to take this time to, as openly as I can, discuss the events that brought about my change of heart.\n \n As you may already know, I was the one behind the 2010 Summer for Marriage Tour which the National Organization for Marriage sponsored and operated throughout July and August last year. It was my doing when, in March that year, I approached Brian Brown, then Executive Director of the National Organization for Marriage about sponsoring and participating in a series of traditional marriage rallies scattered around the Nation.\n \n In fact, the tour route itself, while chosen largely by NOM itself, incorporated as many of the sites I had originally chosen and helped independently organize. Other locations were added due to strategic, political or simply logistical purposes.\n \n Ironically, one of the last tour stops added to the itinerary was Atlanta and I bring this site up because it was in Atlanta that I can remember that I questioned what I was doing for the first time. The NOM showing in the heart of the Bible-belt was dismal and the hundreds of counter-protesters who showed up were nothing short of inspiring.\n \n Even though I had been confronted by the counter-protesters throughout the marriage tour, the lesbian and gay people whom I made a profession out of opposing became real people for me almost instantly. For the first time I had empathy for them and remember asking myself what I was doing.\n \n If my transition from opponent to supporter of same-sex civil marriage was a timeline, Atlanta would be indicated by the first point on the line. The next point on that timeline would be two months later.\n \n After the marriage tour wrapped up and everyone went their separate ways, I transformed my marriage tour \"Inside Look\" blog to a more general blog about protecting marriage and opposing the homosexual agenda.\n \n Over the course of September and October I occupied my time writing up articles along these very lines. Some of the articles were fair, even if you disagree with them, but many of them I would now categorize as propaganda filled with strong and unnecessary rhetoric. This is especially true of the YouTube videos I made.\n \n One article I wrote, towards the end of October, 2010 caught the attention of a blogger by the name of RJ, who writes on the blog AmIWorking. He responded to my article about the homosexual agenda with an article addressed personally to me regarding marriage equality. In short, his article had the miraculous effect of instantly putting things into perspective for me.\n \n At that point, between what I had witnessed on the marriage tour and RJ's post about marriage equality, I really came to understand that gays and lesbians were just real people who wanted to live real lives and be treated equally as opposed to, for example, wanting to destroy American culture. No, they didn't want to destroy American culture, they wanted to openly particulate in it. I was well on my way to becoming a supporter of civil marriage equality. You can read my statement retracting the statements I made about gays and lesbians here.\n \n As a result of that I closed down my blog within a couple of days. That gave birth to my current endeavor, The Conservative Dispatch, which is how I occupy my time. The site is about promoting general conservative principles and is not focused solely on social issues.\n \n In December I came out in support of the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. I also removed the admins I had delegated my moderating duties to for my Facebook page.\n \n Having done that, I had to pick up where they left off. I was largely taken aback by the fact that the page I created had become such a hateful place. My comments and rhetoric paled in comparison to what that place had turned into. I began to understand why the gay community was out there claiming opposition to same-sex civil marriage was all about hate.\n \n I soon realized that there I was surrounded by hateful people; propping up a cause I created five years ago, a cause which I had begun to question. This would be timeline point number three. I wanted to extend an olive branch in some way and started to reinstate those who had been banned by previous administrators of my page. I welcomed them to participate on the page and did what I could do erase the worst comments and even ban those who posted them.\n \n Also, I started regularly conversing with same-sex marriage supporters in another Facebook group. This further solidified my new perception of gays and lesbians as real people, not some faceless political opponent. That could be considered the next point on the timeline.\n \n Lastly, I came to understand the difference between civil marriage and holy marriage as in the sacrament of the Catholic Church. Let me rephrase. I understood that but either willingly chose not to accept it or just didn't see it. Regardless, I see it now and the significance of that is as follows:\n \n Once you understand the great difference between civil marriage and holy marriage, there is not one valid reason to forbid the former from same-sex couples, and all that is left to protect is the latter.\n \n Indeed Christians and Catholics alike are well within their right to demand that holy matrimony, a sacrament and service performed by the Church and recognized by the Church, remains between a man and a woman as their faith would dictate. However, that has nothing to do with civil marriage, performed and recognized by the State in accordance with state law.\n \n My name is Louis J. Marinelli, a conservative-Republican and I now support full civil marriage equality. The constitution calls for nothing less.\n",

Currently if you are a man and woman you are special because as a couple you can do something a gay couple can not. Gays want to be able under the same conditions with the same obligations take advantage of those same benefits. The only rational argument (and I use that phrase with a very broad understanding) is the religious which at the end of the day is very weak and the never talked about political one which is the cost to the government if it recognized gay marriage at the Federal level.\n \n What special rights do you think gay people want that nobody else has?\n \n \nAlso, if you can, (no contention intend), can you answer previous question? Why would same sex couples require government documented marriage if not for religious or political reasons?\n\n \n Because marriage and everything that goes with it comes from the government. Religion is absolutely 100% unnecessary for marriage. Being married in the eyes of God may have value in Heaven (which it actually does not) but here on earth it has 0 value except emotionally. \n \n The religious argument is simply God prohibits gay marriage. Without going into the lengthy reasons of the defects in this argument I will leave it with religion has not the right to impose it's concept of permitted behavior onto anyone else. If a person chooses to follow religion then don't get into a gay relationship and then try and marry that person. Religion doesn't get to enjoy the freedom to practice as it sees fit when it includes taking away the freedoms of others \n \n Without government recognition there is no survivor rights, there are no property rights, there are no tax benefits, there is no spousal rights to name but a few and where these things can be attempted via contract some can not and others do not carry the same strength legally.

   "As I said: I do not hold a religious view on government recognized marriage. Common law or living together before marriage is not at all biblical. If the problem then is that a power of attorney or adoption is \"weak\", how would that justify changing a system ment to protect childrens right by weakening it, as opposed to strengthening those rights protected through power of attorney or adoption to benefit everyone? \n Also, how will common law be effected? If two persons of the same sex for example share a residence, but do not adhere to same sex preferance, will they be considered \"married\"? Or will children protected under common law no longer be protected?\n\n \n The system is not intended for the sole benefit of children. There is no requirement to reproduce, the majority of benefits granted married people have nothing to do with having kids. \n \n By allowing gay couples to marry in no way weakens marriage. Laws don't get watered down by adding a group. Look at discrimination laws they retain the same force regardless of how many groups are added. \n \n A POA is a fairly useless document for many of the benefits granted to married people. Secondly would you want to carry one around to show people any time it became necessary? Why would people be granted these special privileges for doing nothing more than living together. \n \n Common law requires there be an intent to live together as a couple and acting as such. Roommates don't end up in divorce court unless one of them is psycho.\n \n What would change that would leave children unprotected? Nothing. Whatever protections are in place now would remain so.",

   "I may be wrong, but my understanding is that homosexuals people are \"born that way\". What way? To be attracted to the same sex. So isn't safe then to say that someone who is born male and female is obviously born that way? Or someone who is bi? So based on the exact same concept wouldn't it then be unfair or discriminating to limit someone who is born male and female or bi from marrying another male and female? What is the difference?\n\n \n If I understand you correctly that is the argument. People marry someone for reasons other than reproduction. They marry for all the fluffy feelings stuff that make for great chick flicks. But gays don't get warm and fuzzy with the opposite sex, so in effect current law punishes them if they choose to try and experience the relationship that opposite gender couples are free to have as many times as they want (as long as it is one at a time)\n \n Gays just want the same thing nothing more nothing less.",

   "survivor rights are easily established through a will, (a biological child without paternity established would be screwed).property rights can be established through a will or power of attorney ( a child without married parents would become homeless if daddy kicked him/her out along with mommy). You are right about tax benefits as married couples who both work actualy pay more taxes than someone who is single. You are also right about spousal rights as unmarried couples are not subjected to allimony.\n\n \n Family has a greater claim and courts have on many occasions disregarded a will that was challenged by a long lost or estranged family member and the surviving partner loses the person and half of their stuff. \n \n Those rights are easily established for family members which doesn't include your same sex partner. Again your making it all about kids and especially for gay couples that is not the primary concern. Even for straight couples it is a secondary concern until they actually have them and even then it sometimes remains so. As a recognized next of kin you don't need a will, the spouse or kids have rights and claims that are automatic\n \n Again a will is easily challenged potentially tying up assets for years which the surviving person may have paid for completely or in part. A POA allows someone to act on behalf of another when the person becomes incapacitated or dies I don't think the POA continues as the executor of that persons estate takes over whether it be someone named specifically or the courts.\n \n But mommy can turn around and seek immediate relief from and have recourse to attach daddy's wages and make daddy sell the house if he doesn't want her to live there.

He argues for the same actions that he decries in his labeled stereotyped opponents. He lumps people of faith together and then wonders why people do not treat him with individual dignity. Matt is his own argument's worst enemy. I have been telling him for YEARS that he argues against his ends far more effectively than any theoretical \"Christonazi\".

   "Again missing the irony. Read on kind Sir or Madam.\n \n \n \n And out comes the race card. Usually this comes out at the end of a losing argument. \n \n My post was in response to Matt's earlier stereotyping of religion and basically anyone whose opinion does not agree with his. Using the same tactic as a vehicle to note the paucity of Mattew's methods is NOT a wider statement on homosexuality but a reference to the tried and true methods which Matt invokes in lieu of actual argumentation.\n \n \n \n Well, let me take that race card and throw it right back at ye: How do you suppose one would be viewed if they suggested a French Revolution solution to African Americans, homosexuals, jews et al? OUTRAGE!!!! Just look at your own indignation at your misinterpretation of my post. You cannot even muster a stifled yawn at Matt's \"revenge fantasy\". Yet Matt is granted a pass for suggesting this peculiar little solution upon those he labels as \"Fundies\", \"Christonazis\" and other such learned labels. \n \n You might not have observed these things in your 3 months here. Let me bring you up to speed with Matt.\n \n Matt and I have known each other for at least 4 years. In that time he has quite virulently spewed his anti Christian rhetoric whilst openly using names and labels as his sole means of attack. \n \n My problem is not with Matt's argument it is the method with which he chooses to ineffectively advance it. Let me make this easy for you. This post and my previous posts have not argued one way or another against homosexual marriage. Rather, they argue against Matt's own tortured logic. He argues for the same actions that he decries in his labeled stereotyped opponents. He lumps people of faith together and then wonders why people do not treat him with individual dignity. Matt is his own argument's worst enemy. I have been telling him for YEARS that he argues against his ends far more effectively than any theoretical \"Christonazi\". He is a caricature who does damage to his own argument. \n \n If you would advance the cause of full marriage equality you might do well to point out to Matt how his own brand of invective does not lend support to the ends he seeks to acheive.\n\n \n Those African Americans, Jews, and gay people have all dealt with actual, REAL WORLD discrimination. It's not theoretical or satirical, as in the case of alleged trials of the straight white Christian American male. So yes, suggesting further pain be inflicted on the historically disenfranchised groups, through the French Revolution revenge idea, would be quite incensing indeed. The concerns of the white heterosexual Christian American male are of less worry to me. I've had a racial minority male call me a \"cracker\" once because I'm a white male. He then quickly said he was just joking. I would never think of responding with the \"n\" word or some other such word, back, because I'm aware and educated on the history, the experience the group of people have in this society. I respect it. It's not equivalent to any disenfranchisement I may feel by being called \"cracker\". Though, ideally, and in theory, the word cracker shouldn't be used either. \n \n I don't know if Matt really believes these things, if he is playing devil's advocate, or is being satirical. Where are any of these ideas against white heterosexual Christian males, being put into force, as they have been with the other groups mentioned(gays jews blacks)? What should we be most focused on?",

It doesn't matter because it's not happening now (well here). The same goes for homosexuals and blacks. Laws respecting race no longer exist except in the few corners in which they cower under the guise of affirmative action and charity. Laws respecting sexual orientation no longer exist.\n \n Many faces trials, none can blame their genes, culture, or interests for them now or ever.\n \n \nSo yes, suggesting further pain be inflicted on the historically disenfranchised groups, through the French Revolution revenge idea, would be quite incensing indeed.\n\n Then why didn't it concern you?

For example: A man decides to kick his child out along with the childs mother or leaves and leaves them no support.\n\n That is the purpose of marriage though, a promise to remain dedicated to each other and to share responsibilities. A man has no more duty from having sex than a woman does. If homosexuals get married they have made a promise and dragging one parent back based on biological parenthood is redundant.\n \n \nWithout having established paternity the woman and child are now homeless.\n\n So the act of actually creating the child has basically made the promise to care for the child for the parent, which is to say that marriage is automatic or required for sex (wait who thought of that? Oh yes those insane Christians). I am sure when homosexuals are confronted with a child out of wedlock your complaint will be valid :p\n \n \nAlso by redefining marriage the child would not have a right to a legitimate last name or nationality.\n\n Both nationality and last name are cultural conventions having no objective meaning.\n \n \nOk, possibly biological history doesn't mean any to you, but this is not about beliefs, is it?

Social recognition (which the government can't really give them)\n 2. The fiscal benefits of marriage (which the government currently doesn't have a right to give them)\n 3. The ability to adopt children (which should be a function of promising(contract) to take care of the child and the child's choice)\n \n Other than that it's merely a semantic opportunity to continue the fight with anti-homosexual elements even though homosexual sex is no longer illegal or considered mentally ill.",

   "Marriage law isn't designed for the private benefit of any person; it's for the benefit of society. When we pass a law, we pass a law because that law will benefit society as a whole. Society as a whole is befitted from the union of a male and a female in ways that are not valid for unions of two persons of the same sex. \n Society's interest in safe sex, for both physical and emotional health, support heterosexual marriage alone. Only heterosexual unions are capable of procreation. Heterosexual unions provide the optimal environment for nurturing and raising children.\n Once allowed to be officially married, homosexual couples will more than likely be able to adopt. I do not doubt the pure love that these couples would show a child, and I do not doubt their pure intentions. I do believe in the natural drive toward wanting to have children. Yet, I also know that it has been shown that children who are deprived of the parenting of one gender have a very strong tendency toward emotional and/or psychological problems. These issues will affect their entire life. \n The most prevalent argument that I hear is that homosexual couples wish to have the rights of being considered family, especially where hospital emergencies and inheritance issues are concerned. I would argue that if they really love each other that much, then they would take the steps necessary to secure those rights, even if they cannot be officially married. The problem of not being able to see each other in the case of a medical emergency is solved by signing the proper papers ahead of time, which would designate the partners as each other next of kin. \n Legally I could make anyone I wanted my next of kin, thus given the same rights as a family member. If that is not enough to satisfy the inheritance issue also, then I would propose that the couple write a will. Heterosexual couples even generally also go through the process of making a will. I think that it should also be noted that even in the case of a traditional marriage one spouse can fill out a will that would prohibit everything from being left to the other. A husband can just as easily leave everything to his favorite pet as he can to his wife. \n I have also heard that gay couples wish to have an official ceremony that friends and family may attend. There is no law against arranging such a gathering.

I will quickly agree that the studies are accurate, but also point out that we find that disease and cannibalism are at least equally common responses to the same problem. I am not trying to compare homosexuality to disease or cannibalism in any way. However, I would say that until we stop fighting disease and legalize cannibalism, I see this as an invalid argument to support the gay community.\n there is the problem of employers being required to provide health insurance for both partners.

   "From Legal and economic benefits of marriage...\nOn the order of 1,400 legal rights are conferred upon married couples in the U.S. Typically these are composed of about 400 state benefits and over 1,000 federal benefits. Among them are the rights to:[*]joint parenting;[*]joint adoption;[*]joint foster care, custody, and visitation (including non-biological parents);[*]status as next-of-kin for hospital visits and medical decisions where one partner is too ill to be competent;[*]joint insurance policies for home, auto and health;[*]dissolution and divorce protections such as community property and child support;[*]immigration and residency for partners from other countries;[*]inheritance automatically in the absence of a will;[*]joint leases with automatic renewal rights in the event one partner dies or leaves the house or apartment;[*]inheritance of jointly-owned real and personal property through the right of survivorship (which avoids the time and expense and taxes in probate);[*]benefits such as annuities, pension plans, Social Security, and Medicare;[*]spousal exemptions to property tax increases upon the death of one partner who is a co-owner of the home;[*]veterans' discounts on medical care, education, and home loans; joint filing of tax returns;[*]joint filing of customs claims when traveling;[*]wrongful death benefits for a surviving partner and children;[*]bereavement or sick leave to care for a partner or child;[*]decision-making power with respect to whether a deceased partner will be cremated or not and where to bury him or her;[*]crime victims' recovery benefits;[*]loss of consortium tort benefits;[*]domestic violence protection orders;[*]judicial protections and evidentiary immunity;[*]and more....Most of these legal and economic benefits cannot be privately arranged or contracted for. For example, absent a legal (or civil) marriage, there is no guaranteed joint responsibility to the partner and to third parties (including children) in such areas as child support, debts to creditors, taxes, etc. In addition, private employers and institutions often give other economic privileges and other benefits (special rates or memberships) only to married couples. And, of course, when people cannot marry, they are denied all the emotional and social benefits and responsibilities of marriage as well.\n",

   "I was wrong about same-sex marriage - David Frum\nEditor's note: David Frum writes a weekly column for CNN.com. A special assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002, he is the author of six books, including \"Comeback: Conservatism That Can Win Again,\" and is the editor of FrumForum.\n \n Washington (CNN) -- I was a strong opponent of same-sex marriage. Fourteen years ago, Andrew Sullivan and I forcefully debated the issue at length online (at a time when online debate was a brand new thing).\n \n Yet I find myself strangely untroubled by New York state's vote to authorize same-sex marriage -- a vote that probably signals that most of \"blue\" states will follow within the next 10 years.\n \n I don't think I'm alone in my reaction either. Most conservatives have reacted with calm -- if not outright approval -- to New York's dramatic decision.\n \n Why?\n \n The short answer is that the case against same-sex marriage has been tested against reality. The case has not passed its test.\n \n Since 1997, same-sex marriage has evolved from talk to fact.\n \n If people like me had been right, we should have seen the American family become radically more unstable over the subsequent decade and a half.\n \n Instead -- while American family stability has continued to deteriorate -- it has deteriorated much more slowly than it did in the 1970s and 1980s before same-sex marriage was ever seriously thought of.\n \n By the numbers, in fact, the 2000s were the least bad decade for American family stability since the fabled 1950s. And when you take a closer look at the American family, the facts have become even tougher for the anti-gay marriage position.\n \n Middle-class families have become somewhat more stable than they used to be. For example: College-educated women who got married in the 1990s were much less likely to get divorced than equally educated women who got married in the 1970s.\n \n What's new and different in the past 20 years is the collapse of the Hispanic immigrant family. First-generation Latino immigrants maintain traditional families: conservative values, low divorce rates, high fertility and -- despite low incomes -- mothers surprisingly often at home with the children.\n \n But the second-generation Latino family looks very different. In the new country, old norms collapse. Nearly half of all children born to Hispanic mothers are now born out of wedlock.\n \n The case against same-sex marriage has been tested against reality. The case has not passed its test.\n \n Whatever is driving this negative trend, it seems more than implausible to connect it to same-sex marriage. How would it even work that a 15-year-old girl in Van Nuys, California, becomes more likely to have a baby because two men in Des Moines, Iowa, can marry?\n \n Maybe somebody can believe the connection, but I cannot.\n \n I remain as worried as ever about the decline in family stability among poorer Americans. But as for same-sex marriage, my attitude follows the trajectory described nearly 150 years ago by the English writer Anthony Trollope in his novel \"Phineas Finn.\"\n \n Two of his characters are discussing a proposed reform that has just been defeated in Parliament. The author of the reform is understandably dejected. His friend consoles him by pointing to the future:\n \n \"Many who before regarded legislation on the subject as chimerical, will now fancy that it is only dangerous, or perhaps not more than difficult. And so in time it will come to be looked on as among the things possible, then among the things probable; -- and so at last it will be ranged in the list of those few measures which the country requires as being absolutely needed. That is the way in which public opinion is made.\"\n \n By coincidence, I am writing these words on the morning of my own 23rd wedding anniversary. Of all the blessings life has to offer, none equals a happy marriage. If proportionally fewer Americans enjoy that blessing today than did 40 years ago, we're going to have to look for the explanation somewhere other than the Legislature in Albany.\n",

   "As I have mentioned before. Marriage is the only government recognized institution that protects the rights of children. Unlike same sex couples, children do not have the ability to establish their rights any other way.\n\n \n Marriage itself does not protect the rights of children. There are separate laws that do that. Financial responsibility is not based on whether the parents were married. An unwed parent is just as liable as a wedded parent. A married parent can just as easily deny paternity as an unwed parent. Your belief that marriage grants children special protections that adopted children will not have is incorrect. \n \n What laws are you referring to that are afforded to natural children that are not given to adopted children or vice versa? \n \n or are granted to the children or wedded parents and not unwedded?\n \n \nThere is also mountains of proof that children raised in homes where there is both gender role models are psychological ,emotionaly , and socaily healthier which is why we don't promote single parent homes.\n\n \n Yes as compared to single parent homes, not same sex homes, either single or two parents. So your basing your statement on evidence that does not account for the circumstances that you say are inferior. \n \n \nHow same-sex \"marriage\" affects Massachusetts\n\n \n Like I said you should visit credible sites to get your information\n \n I assume you did not bother to read the facts about this trusting the website would be honest in detailing the events it discusses. \n \n I only read two claims it made and found both to be biased and not completely truthful.\n \n The part were it said one school teacher would openly discuss the use of sex toys by lesbians failed to mention she was a sex ed teacher and doing so was in a question answer part of the curriculum concerning different types of intercourse. It was implied that this teacher was doing so in the course of teaching Math, English or some other subject where the topic would be out of place for the class.\n \n The second was the man who was arrested as the article wants you to believe for trying to discuss the school policy on teaching about same sex families. Mr. Parker had repeatedly been told that the school material in question was not subject to the MA opt-out laws and that the school would not make an exception for his children. Over several months Mr. Parker continued to insist the school comply with his requests finally meeting with school officials, he had drafted an agreement that the school refused to sign. After two hours the school ended the meeting at which time Mr. Parker refused to leave school grounds. At 5:20 police arrived and at 6:00 a lieutenant arrived and all 3 tried to get Mr. Parker to leave voluntarily. He refused stating he was performing an act of civil disobedience in protest of the school policy. He was arrested for trespassing shortly after.\n \n That is a bit different than what is implied by \"strongly insisted on being notified when teachers were discussing homosexuality or transgenderism with his son, the school had him arrested and put in jail overnight.\"",

When the federal government is forcing it's will on the confederacy for equal rights, then it's obvious how necessary it is (people claim); but when it's the federal government forcing injustices than it's obvious states rights are primary. This is hypocrisy not a check and balance.\n \n All people are saying is that the people who make the right decisions are right (wow!).\n \n If this were a moral issue it would be neither a state or federal issue it would be the responsibility of each person.\n \n \nThat's not saying that the States who have made Gay Marriage Illegal by Legislation are right.. what I'm saying is that the Feds should not be sticking their 2 cents into State issues . Gay People already had it hard enough trying to fight for equality on a State level but now because of Government Abuse of power they have to fight on a Federal level too. \n\n They ought to only fight on a moral level. By trusting states to be right about rights but not the federal government you are claiming that the moral truth of the matter is attached to their decisions. This cannot be the case. All you can say is that it would be less trouble at this place and time if states could choose individually, and even then only for those states that choose correctly.\n \n \nWell this is not about just the taxes.\n\n There are other parts of the marriage framework yes, but none of them are rights either, they ought to be conventions and legal structure.\n \n The only injustice I see however is that as a poster pointed out in another thread the government is taking homosexuals money to pay for organizations that discriminate against homosexuals.\n \n This is only a particular subset of the general problem.\n \n The problem is the government taking A's money to pay for B.\n \n Where moral analysis concludes these variables:\n A = anyone\n B = anything they don't want to pay for\n \n Clearly A = homosexuals is a subset of anyone, B = discriminatory marriage benefits is a subset of anything they don't want to pay for.\n \n If easyrider claimed \"I am only willing to pay for benefits for heterosexual marriage\" he has that right, just as Matthew is allowed to only pay for homosexual marriage.

   "The Federal Government is. They don't have the right to get involved in anything to do with marriage, yet they passed DOMA to specifically disallow Gay Married couples the same RIGHTS that Hetero couples have.\n\n \n Correct me if I am wrong but I don't think the Fed is interferring with a state. The Fed has passed laws that define its position on marriage, but it isn't saying states have to do so as well. \n \n \nAlready said that, and that is fine. Marriage is a State by State decision and the Feds are not only infringing on individual rights but they blatantly ignoring states rights to as of now 6 states, by overstepping the boundaries of States Rights.\n\n \n If the Fed was doing that then those states could not pass laws allowing it,\n \n They are. \n \n \n \n \nThis isn't about human nature, it's about the Federal Government abusing their power to discriminate against a group of people. The States have the right to decided their own Marriage Laws, the Feds do not have that right. \n\n \n I would agree but the states do not have the right to dictate what the Fed will do either. \n \n \nI agree. The Federal Government should not be allowed to have anything to do with Marriage, it is a State Issue. Before DOMA the Federal Government did not have a \" Definition\" for Marriage. It never said Marriage was between one man and one woman. With the passage of DOMA they applied this Definition to specifically discriminate against Gay Marriage and in effect gave the States a Safety net to keep Gay Marriage out of their States. As of now The Government is applying two sets of Tax laws to the states. \n 1: The States where Gay Marriage is NOT allowed are under one set of rules, \n 2: In States where Gay Marriage IS allowed the Gay couples are under a different set of rules.\n \n \n The fed was involved in marriage say for taxes. It was not an issue before because marriage was uniformly a man and woman in every state. When states added a different coupling the Fed had to define what it would recognize also.\n \n \nSo tell me.. how is this equal for all?...\n\n \n For the Fed I think it looks also at the economic impact recognition would have on revenue, not that that should be a consideration but somewhere someone said that would cost a lot of money. The primary reasons I would agree are political, conservatives vote more than liberals and that is what counts. Gays have done a good job recently shifting their focus and they are seeing the payoff. Conservatives are trying the same tactics and it is getting old. I think gay marriage will become law across the Union at some point and it is to bad it will be in the future but the when it does it will be a huge blow to religion and the country just isn't willing to engage in that just yet.",

   "Actually, the idea that children deserve to have their rights protected as opposed to the recognition and financial benefits of gay marriage is a personal opinion.\n\n \n \nFederal motor carrier safety regulations\n (Not everyone is permitted to drive a rig or carry a CDL)\n\n \n And this has what to do with marriage?\n \n \n \nPassports\n (Not everyone qualifies)\n\n \n Still looking for the marriage connection\n \n \n \nBlood donations.\n (Gay men, interrveinious drug users, and recent tattoos or piercing, are banned )\n\n \n Marriage connection, no \n \n \nHud housing, welfare, social security, unemployment, veterans benifites, student visas, college admissions.\n (All require special qualifications and benefits society as a whole)\n\n \n And marriage doesn't happen to be one of those qualifications does it? Now marriage can be a factor on certain SS and VA benefits, but you need not be married to be eligible as a primary recipient for any of the above.\n \n My question and the topic concerned marriage. \n \n \n \nNever suggested that. But their in reason why gay men are not allowed to donate blood.\n\n \n Unless they happen to feed it to the guests at thier wedding as a requirement to have it made official or are raising vampires I don't see why that makes a difference. There is a long list of people blood banks won't take blood from. Being at risk for disease is not a deal breaker for a marriage.\n \n \nAs a single mom, having raised two sons(now men), after their fathers death, I can personaly testify that \"most\" women do not shave their face or urinate standing up. LOLLOL\n\n \n As a single guy coming from a single mom who raised two sons none of the women I known did those things either. Having also been married I don't recall either of those questions on my marriage application. \n \n \nSingle parent homes have never been promoted in our society. Divorce also was never recognized as a positive thing, and was in fact discouraged , and usually met with child support, alimony, and many other restrictions ment to protect the child. That is untill the gay movement. \n\n \n I really do not understand this. Gays don't effect any of these things. If a gay couple adopts a child or uses artificial methods to become pregnant and they then divorce guess what one will have primary custody and one will pay support for the child. The courts will decide which one same as with straight couples. Why would it be any different. If a straight couple adopts are you suggesting if they split then there is no custody or support options available? \n \n Granting marriage rights would most likely do the opposite of what you are stating. Currently same sex couple living together are not liable to each other for anything. If one was succesfull and the other stayed at home and raised a child either adopted or from another relationship and they split the stay at home one has no right to anything. if they had married and adopted or had their own or adopted the child from another relationship now there is recourse and responsibility.\n \n \nYes you can. What other purpose would it have?\n\n \n A will does not make someone a relative. The purpose is to direct the courts as to the terms of disolving the decedents estate. Courts generally comply with the wishes of the deceased, but do not have to. There are ways that same sex couple can protect their property and have their wishes executed, but they tend to be costly and have drawbacks that don't always make them desireable. Same sex couples generally can bypass a lot of these issues simply because they are married.\n \n \nReal? Marriage is not real without recognition from those who may not agree with you or \"automatic\" financial benefits from the government? \n\n \n Yes that is the point. Gay couples who accept the burdens of marriage would also like to receive the benefits and not suffer additional consequences for playing house.\n \n \nActually, the idea that children deserve to have their rights protected as opposed to the recognition and financial benefits of gay marriage is a personal opinion.\n\n \n That you can have all day long.

Adopt, one will already have a child from a prior relationship or artificially/donor/surragate. \n If their state allows marriage and they are married or if their state allows second parent adoption then the non bio parent adopts and both are legal parents no different than straight people. If their state does not allow these options then only the biological parent is responsible which is the same for straight couples. If the husband is not the father guess what it doesn't matter if they have been married 17 years or 7 months he isn't financially responsible. \n \n \n \nObviously child support will still be the responsibility of the biological parents. \n \n \n \n Unless adoption occurs then both are and that is for same sex and opposite sex couples. \n \n \nUntil the gay movement, divorce was not something looked upon favorably. \n \n \n It still isn't. It just happens so often that people have become numb to it. The expectation is that a marriage will fail as most do and most people now are either an ex or child of an ex. It isn't gays that have caused greater acceptance of divorce it is straight people who divorce more than marry. After all gays have not been able to marry how can they be at fault for divorce?\n \n \n \nBut for a same sex couple to be a family it requires a child be from a broken home. \n\n \n Talk radio steering you wrong again. Same sex couples can make brand new people same as kind and model as straight people. A child can come from a broken home as is the case for both couples but there is no requirement that the child come from a broken home.\n \n But let us say that is true or the majority will come from foster care. For someone who says they want to protect children your desire is to keep them in foster care where statistically they will grow up and fail to successfully integrate into society. Foster cares lengthy record on being just a step above being on the streets is far superior to the research showing gay couples for the most part make at least mediocre if not good parents. \n Why is that?\n \n \nThis is why, until the gay movement, single parents were not considered fit for adoption.\n\n \n I see it is gay people (the ones who can't have kids) who have flooded the foster care system necessitating the need to broaden its pool of potential parents to handle the increasing number of kids entering into the program. \n \n And foster care is preferred over single parent adoptions because one social worker for every 20 - 100 kids who is overworked and underpaid and has kids of their own to worry about is much better for than a single parent adopting 1 child.\n \n Does that about sum up your position or am I not understanding you correctly?",

Matt said he would vote against their rights, as they had used their power against his.\n\n If he has just said the first part, I would be cheering him on, but the last part proves that the first part was not an illustration of a morally unacceptable situation but his hope at getting revenge on an abstract collective. If he had left any avenue to interpret his statements as morally sound I would not have condemned them. He however explicitly expressed his desire to violate rights, not merely illustrate that the system allows such violation.\n \n \nNow, we have several people on here, quickly showing their outrage against this potential prospect.\n\n As far as I express emotion on this forum, this is nothing new. I do not like the violation of rights and I object to their advocation in all circumstances and from all advocates.\n \n \nSome of them don't bother to lend much, if any support to gay rights in this forum(shooter and proud is the exception). \n\n If homosexuals are human, I have defended their rights as strenuously as possible.\n \n \nFor gays it's not a theory, it's reality.\n\n It's reality for us all, except those who are deluded into thinking they chose choicelessness.\n \n \nI'd say what Matt has merely proposed when it comes to the rights of others, gives you or them a small inkling of what we feel\n\n Perhaps you feel outrage at the subjectivist fallacies that would claim that there is no truth, that the next best thing is the will of the majority. Perhaps you know that there is a moral truth even if you don't know exactly how to describe it, and you know that no matter how many people in the world ignore or deny it; it's there and it validates your actions not by social acceptance but by something more fundamental; something natural to humanity.\n \n If that is what you feel, then yes I have felt it; throughout the ages those who have had their rights violated have felt it. It is their value system which produces these emotions, it is recognition of this value system which demands men respect the rights of others.\n \n Too many homosexuals desperate for philosophical backing have been drawn to a most despicable current based on non-judgement. It advocates the immunization from the disapproval of others through the suspension of thought (for to think is to judge). This prompts them to ask 'who are you to judge me?' The answer I give is 'a person', but a counter-question cuts deeper into the fallacy. \"Who are you to judge yourself?\"\n \n Judgement is not the evil here. Remember that feeling I was just talking about, well there is a philosophy that claims you can know what it's about, where it comes from, claims that not only can you control it but once you understand where emotions come from they are not even forces you need to fight against in a struggle for peace, resolve, or self-control. It claims you can know moral truth not just feel it. That is the philosophical backing homosexuals (as a instance of the category human) need, their emotion is a poor argument, but their is reasoning which can be brought to bear.\n \n So do not pretend that the insignificant difference of sexual orientation has somehow magically made you so unique that you now face problems alien the human race that the 'rest of us' need to be made to understand. \n \n \nSo yes, perhaps Matt was just getting you to think and react to show how unjust this notion is when it's your rights up for a vote.\n\n .... but my rights are up for a vote, and I have been crusading to expose it's injustice.",

Which I would agree is important, but the information is presented not in a manner that attempts to identify various cause and effect relationships that result in the stats, but to place emphasis on one possible reason which they support.\n \n This was one of the more noticable instances of manipulating the facts. The place where your website got it's facts is here\n \n Fathers & Families | The Father Factor - Data on the Consequences of Father Absence\n \n Which goes under various version of The Fatherhood Initiative. This was part of their report\n \n Father Factor in Child Abuse\n \n \n An analysis of child abuse cases in a nationally representative sample of 42 counties found that children from single-parent families are more likely to be victims of physical and sexual abuse than children who live with both biological parents. Compared to their peers living with both parents, children in single parent homes had:\n a 77% greater risk of being physically abused\n an 87% greater risk of being harmed by physical neglect\n a 165% greater risk of experiencing notable physical neglect\n a 74% greater risk of suffering from emotional neglect\n an 80% greater risk of suffering serious injury as a result of abuse\n overall, a 120% greater risk of being endangered by some type of child abuse.\n Source: Sedlak, Andrea J. and Diane D. Broadhurst. The Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect: Final Report. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Washington, D.C., September 1996.\n \n Things I found most interesting as I read through the information is A) Women are not fit to raise children. From the information provided I don't see how we have achieved the level of civilization we have considering the considerable damage children suffer when left alone with mothers. \n B) The ability to raise wonder children by men seems to only be possible with their biological children. When rearing someone else's child they have little impact. The only rational conclusion is that the damage a mother causes is immediate and irreversible. C) I noticed two other odd things for the few dozen stats offered almost none came from a source more than once and there were stats with numbers like 165% and 220%. \n \n I felt perhaps women were not being fairly represented and maybe the site dedicated to fathers was just expressing themselves passionately, but not accurately. I went to the source they cited for the above stats and it stated the following \n \n Family Structure. Children of single parents were at higher risk of physical abuse and of all types of neglect and were overrepresented among seriously injured, moderately injured, and endangered children. Compared with their counterparts living with both parents, children in single-parent families had\n \n a 77-percent greater risk of being harmed by physical abuse (using the stringent Harm Standard) and a 63-percent greater risk of experiencing any countable physical abuse (using the Endangerment Standard);\n an 87-percent greater risk of being harmed by physical neglect and a 165-percent greater risk of experiencing any countable physical neglect;\n a 74-percent greater risk of being harmed by emotional neglect and a 64-percent greater risk of experiencing any countable emotional neglect;\n a 220-percent (or more than three times) greater risk of being educationally neglected;\n an approximately 80-percent greater risk of suffering serious injury or harm from abuse or neglect;\n an approximately 90-percent greater risk of receiving moderate injury or harm as a result of child maltreatment; and\n a 120-percent (or more than two times) greater risk of being endangered by some type of child abuse or neglect.\n \n Among children in single-parent households, those living with only their fathers were approximately one and two-thirds times more likely to be physically abused than those living with only their mothers.\n \n Although parents are not necessarily, nor even most frequently, the perpetrators of maltreatment, the relationship between parent structure and maltreatment incidence is understandable, considering the added responsibilities and stresses of single-parenting together with the likelihood that surrounding social and practical support may be inadequate.\n \n Family Size. The incidence of maltreatment was related to the number of dependent children in the family, especially in the categories of physical and educational neglect. For educational neglect, and for physical neglect according to the Harm Standard, the pattern was nonlinear: the incidence rates were highest for children in the largest families (those with four or more children), intermediate for \"only\" children, and lowest for children in families with two to three children. Children in the largest families were almost three times more likely to be educationally neglected, and nearly two and two-fifths times more likely to be physically neglected under the Harm Standard, compared to children in families with two or three children. Under the Endangerment Standard, the pattern was one of increasing incidence of physical neglect with greater numbers of children. Children in the largest families were physically neglected at nearly three times the rate of those who came from \"only\" child families.\n \n Additional children in a household mean additional tasks and responsibilities, so it is understandable why incidence rates of child abuse and neglect may be higher when there are more children. Accounting for why \"only\" children have higher rates of educational neglect and of physical neglect under the Harm Standard than children in families with two or three children requires a different explanation. One possibility is that there may be too many expectations focused on \"only\" children, whereas expectations (and disappointments) are diffused over multiple children in the larger families. Another possibility is that many \"only\" child households represent the early stages in their families' development, since a number of these families will have additional children, in time. Thus, many \"only\" children are in families with relatively young and inexperienced parents and caretakers.\n \n Executive Summary of the Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect\n \n As you can see they seemed to have left out some rather important details that were not consistent with their purpose.\n \n I would also point out that a lot of your stats include not just fatherless homes, but children of no parent homes as well. Foster care stats are horrible especially when they just turn 18 and are on their own. \n \n And lastly what does this have to do with same sex marriage? I mean your sort of putting the cart before the horse. Sure there will be children involved but let's not forget it won't be for a large part of them and for those that do these stats are for straight people. Gay people are different as evidenced by their inability to marry in the first place.",
