In the course of about 2 hours, I've had AA question my sexuality, my intelligence, my motives, and was again called cowardly and dishonest. Enough already. \n \n Here's the latest accusation of dishonesty from AA, the accusation is quoted below. \n \n \nAnother example of your cowardly debating style. Here is CxTs response to my post challenging her dating of the big bang, and she never claimed I misinterpreted her at all . All she did was back pedal which is alot more honest than your attempts to confuse and obfuscate when cornered.\n \n\n Once again, rather than respond in a rational way (read my previous posts for what promoted this outburst), I am accused of being a dishonest coward. Will anything ever be done about such behaviour?",

Typical behaviour.\n\n More importantly, look at what immediately happens.\n \n Archangel declares that he really understands the theory but disagrees with the assumptions. He then proceeds to make it clear that he doesn't understand the theory. This puts Peeling in an impossible position: either he can pretend that Archie knows what he's talking about and spend his time exploring rabbit holes, or he can try to tell Archie that Archie really doesn't understand. The problem with the latter is that Archie goes bonkers and declares that he knows more about evolutionary theory that people with formal education in biology do.\n \n Even more importantly, though -- and this is the real reason that convincing Archie of anything he doesn't want to believe is impossible -- look at Archangel's response to Peeling's answers. The whole charade starts when Archangel demands explanations of observations that he thinks evolutionary theory cannot provide. So, Peeling provides those explanations. How does Archie respond?\n \nThe error in your reasoning is that you can't prove that by any standard other than assuming it based on how you interpret how MAN fits in with the rest of the chain of life on Earth. ...\n \n This sounds very nice and neat from an evolutionists point of view, but it isn't nearly so simple a conclusion when you consider the actual facts involved\n\n Let's analyze: Archie says, \"I don't accept evolutionary theory (in part, at least) because of these factoids,\" or \"But these are all assumptions.\" Peeling explains how evolutionary theory addresses those factoids coherently or why no assumptions are required. Archie then says, \"Well, that's all fine and dandy within the scope of the theory, but I don't accept it.\"\n \n Does anybody else see the catch here?\n \n \n When Archie isn't doing the above, he's skirting an explanation by saying, \"Oh yeah? Well...\" and then going off on an inconsequential and irrelevant tangent in an attempt to avoid the point.\n \nWe weren't competing with chimps? Oh really? Doesn't evo claim that the first humans and hominids appeared in Africa? And isn't the dark Continent also the natural and original ecosystem where the Great Apes are from? So how do you claim we never competed if evo is true?\n\n It's as if he didn't even read the explanation. No matter how much we tell him that two plus two isn't five, there seems to be no convincing him otherwise.\n \n I thought we were doing well when we finally got him looking for information on non-nutjob sites, but it seems that all he's really interested in doing is coming up with some justification for his immutable superstition.",
