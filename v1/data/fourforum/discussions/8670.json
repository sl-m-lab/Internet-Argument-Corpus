   "While some may think Reuters is justified in making the news appear as they wish, I think they should be kicked out of the war zone.\n \n http://www.israelnn.com/news.php3?id=109521\n Reuters News Lies\n \n Bombing of Funeral: False Reporting by Reuters 16:43 Aug 08, '06 / 14 Av 5766\n \n (IsraelNN.com) The day after it was revealed that a Reuters News Agency doctored photographs to show an anti-Israel bias, the news service incorrectly reported Tuesday afternoon that the IDF bombed a funeral procession in Lebanon.Reuters has corrected without apology its earlier story that the IDF strafed a funeral procession and updated the report to state that the bombs struck a village at the same time the funeral was taking place, adding that \"the air strike was not in the immediate vicinity of the funeral.\"\n \n \n http://www.zombietime.com/reuters_photo_fraud/\n The recent discovery that the Reuters news agency released a digitally manipulated photograph as an authentic image of the bombing in Beirut has drawn attention to the important topic of bias in the media. But lost in the frenzy over one particular image is an even more devastating fact: that over the last week Reuters has been caught red-handed in an astonishing variety of journalistic frauds in the photo coverage of the war in Lebanon.",
