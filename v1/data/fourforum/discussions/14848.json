They're making an industry out of a sort of academic 'shock-jock' approach toward trashing religion. Atheist academics like them for the same reason other people like to listen to Howard Stern. Though to be fair this is more the case for Hitchens than Dawkins. \n \n Here is an interesting clip of Dawkins interviewing the Archbishop of Canterbury; this is a good example of how religious people are thinkers and questioners as well, and often there is very little that atheists bring up that theists have not long already personally dealt with. Certainly the atheist holds no corner on reason. Rowan Williams has no trouble dealing with his arguments. A lot of what he answers here, very successfully IMO, are things often argued by anti-theists right here on this forum. (Dawkins is far calmer here than he is in some of his 'livelier' debates, and it is refreshing. I think he and other atheists would find far more success at gaining dialog with the calm and reasoned approach)\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgQp36yre84&feature=related\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEUPKhr1h6g&feature=related\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joWcREMc1y0&feature=related",

They've never been under no threat--they have the full right and freedom to be as atheist as they want, as do you. There is far greater threat to religious freedom being taken away in the world than the freedom to be atheist.\n Anyway, if you want to be a \"militant atheist\" as you call it, that's your prerogative.

(See it through to the end of it)\n \n YouTube - Atheisms Negative Effect On History(Richard Dawkins Response)\n\n \n See this is where I disagree here. We as Atheists do not go around threatening to destroy the civilized world or churches, or people, or certain ethnic groups because of our conclusions that there is a lack of evidence to show a deity exists.\n \n Rather, we use our objective and critical thinking to see the world and the universe around us for what it truly is. You are attempting to bridge the atrocities of the Crusades and modern Fundamentalism with the atrocities of Stalin. Two separate entities motivated by different reasons.\n \n Fundamentalism gives clairvoyance to commit atrocities and see them as justified.\n \n Where as in Stalin's case as shown, it was not Atheism in general that is to be seen in these crimes but the actions put forth by a literal madman using the foundations of Atheism as justification for murder. Just like in using literal texts from scripture to kill abortionists, Stalin contorted the views of Atheism and objective reasoning to bypass any conscience he may have once held.\n \n \n \n \n Joseph Stalin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Stalin had a complex relationship with religious institutions in the Soviet Union.[300] One story reports that while he studied at a seminary, he became a closet atheist.[301] However, this story fails on several obvious accounts, including Stalin's remaining religious, even pious, for some years longer.[302] One account states that Stalin's reversal on bans against the church during World War II followed a sign that he believed he received from heaven.[303]\n \n Historian Edvard Radzinsky used recently discovered secret archives and noted a story that changed Stalin's attitude toward religion.[303] The story in which Ilya, Metropolitan of the Lebanon Mountains, claimed to receive a sign from heaven that \"The churches and monasteries must be reopened throughout the country. Priests must be brought back from imprisonment, Leningrad must not be surrendered, but the sacred icon of Our Lady of Kazan should be carried around the city boundary, taken on to Moscow, where a service should be held, and thence to Stalingrad Tsaritsyn.\"[303]\n \n Shortly thereafter, Stalin's attitude changed and \"Whatever the reason, after his mysterious retreat, he began making his peace with God. Something happened which no historian has yet written about. On his orders many priests were brought back to the camps. In Leningrad, besieged by the Germans and gradually dying of hunger, the inhabitants were astounded, and uplifted, to see wonder-working icon Our Lady of Kazan brought out into the streets and borne in procession.\"[303] Radzinsky asked, \"Had he seen the light? Had fear made him run to his Father? Had the Marxist God-Man simply decided to exploit belief in God? Or was it all of these things at once?.\"[303]\n \n During the Second World War Stalin reopened the Churches. One reason could have been to motivate the majority of the population who had Christian beliefs. The reasoning behind this is that by changing the official policy of the party and the state towards religion, the Church and its clergymen could be to his disposal in mobilizing the war effort. On 4 September 1943, Stalin invited Metropolitan Sergius, Metropolitan Alexy and Metropolitan Nikolay to the Kremlin and proposed to reestablish the Moscow Patriarchate, which had been suspended since 1925, and elect the Patriarch. On 8 September 1943, Metropolitan Sergius was elected Patriarch.\n \n Another reason that may have motivated this greater tolerance after the war, was the great failure of the persecutions of the 1920s and 1930s to actually achieve the intended result of eliminating religion.\n \n The CPSU Central Committee continued to promote atheism and the elimination of religion during the remainder of Stalin's lifetime after the 1943 concordat.[304] Stalin's greater tolerance for religion after 1943 was limited, and persecutions resumed at the end of the war, although on a lesser scale than had been existent in the 1930s. For these reasons it is unlikely that Stalin had changed his atheistic rejection of religion during this last portion of his lifetime.",

   "The Dangers of Religion - J.S. Brown\n Submitted by Tomcat on November 1, 2006 - 10:55am.\n \n For anyone to say I am a little bitter about organized religion is sort of like saying that someone who has their head cut off is \"bleeding a little.\" I'm sure I'm going to XXXX off a few \"true believers\" here. Quite possibly I'm going to be accused of being a \"godless heathen\" or something like that. I don't really care what you think of me, just think without the glaze of religion over your faces for once in your lives! For years I've toed the line of an agnostic: I was unwilling or unable to prove to myself one way or another concerning the existence of any God(s). As I continued my education (such a dangerous thing, education). I came to realize that with very few exception organized religion is one of the primary causes of suffering and cruelty in this world and has been for thousands of years. (Even the \"peace-loving\" Hindu/Buddhists of India are hypocrites testing nuclear weapons when the rest of the world is trying to outgrow them). When we explore the origins of religion, we see a number of motivations coming together into one neat little package:\n \n The consolidation of power over the masses Creating a common moral code of living The fellowship of human beings in one place The accumulation of wealth which is untaxable Political influence and peddling behind the \"scenes\" Answering the questions which remain unanswerable while not all of these things are bad, I think it is easy to see that there are just a few problems here.\n \n First of all, the consolidation of power over the masses in Christianity hit its zenith during the Dark Ages, when the church dominated the often ignorant and illiterate commoners. Striking them with the \"awe of God\" was as easy as building massive churches and filling them with art, plundered treasures, and stained glass. These people were truely \"sheep\" and the clergy were their willing shepherds. The clergy kept control by calling anyone who dared challenge them \"witches,\" or \"heritics,\" and through torture and execution, they used fear to keep the masses in line, including kings. This eventually led to the Renaissance, Protestant reformation, and the breakup of the Catholic monopoly (it kind of reminds me of the breakup of the Bell System here in America). If you think it couldn't possibly have been that bad, then you need to look seriously at the countries which still run things like most of Europe did during the Dark Ages: just look at the fundamentalist religious dictatorships in the Middle East for inspiration and you will see how much good comes from organized religion when it runs every aspect of a citizen's life.\n \n Creating a common moral code of living is probably one of the more positive ideas to come out of religion, however, who decides what the code shall be? We are not given the choice of making our own code obviously. We are forced into a code that is determined by \"God.\" Not only are there the 10 Commandments to deal with, many of which make little or no sense what-so-ever, but endless, contradicting requirements spread throughout both the Old and New Testaments. When it was the clergy interpreting the scriptures for us, things were so much simpler than today. Now every nut with a cause thinks he or she can look up in the Bible and twist its contradictory meanings and ambiguities to their own needs and desires. As a result, we get pro-lifers gunning down abortion doctors, people saying that Jesus told them to commit acts of atrocities against \"sinners\" to punish them, and so on.\n \n People are using the Bible to justify denying homosexuals the right to \"Life, Liberty, and Property\" as defined by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution simply because they think they have a right to judge them...(doesn't Jesus say something to the effect: \"Judge not lest ye be judged\" ?). Many members of the religious right are calling for a return to \"simpler times,\" and I don't blame them. Now that anyone can carry on a conversation with their \"God,\" all hell has broken loose! And what about those hypocrites who \"sin\" 6 days a week and then confess their sins and are absolved to run amok all over again? They pay \"lip service\" to their beliefs and then go and do whatever they want anyway. Tell me that makes sense!\n \n Another decent aspect of many organized religions is the fellowship of human beings in one place. I have been on plenty of church picnics and Methodist corn roasts and found them mostly to be quite fun. I wouldn't wish to trade the experience with family and friends for anything. I have to admit, however, that I've had the same kind of fun at college faculty picnics and gatherings of other groups and organizations without any formal ties to religion, so I suppose it doesn't matter to me.\n \n For all their talk of helping the poor and assisting those less fortunate, the churches of the west sure do hoard their money to build impressive alters to God, fund political campaigns, and televise their message of peace to the world. It seems to me that if they sold off all their real-estate holdings, melted down all their gold and other metals, cut up their precious jewels and vestments, they'd probably have enough money to feed and house the entire third world for some time to come. I'd be really impressed with the organized religions of the world if they gave up all their trappings and gave them to the poor. They don't need all that stuff to preach \"the true word of God.\" They can do it just as easily in the alleys and public parks as they can from their high and mighty pulpits. I challenge the religions of the world to do just that: Throw off your trappings and finery, convert all your assets and holdings into cash and feed the world, if you do that, I will proudly endorse you.\n \n The other wonderful thing these days is that if I wanted to, I could create a religion, begin to take in money, and claim \"non-tax\" status from the government. What a crock! I think I'll start \"The Church of Jeffrey\" right now and everyone can give to me so I can sit and \"speak with God\" all day. I'll tell you what She's saying when I'm ready, in the meantime, just keep those donations rolling in!\n \n For years we've heard the old \"Separation of Church and State\" argument (a term first coined by a non-christian \"Deist\" named Thomas Jefferson), but it seems that the \"religious right\" has a very strong political voice in our government. My guess would be that they have found all sorts of inventive ways to fund the \"chosen people\" into office to peddle their high and mighty morality.\n \n If the Religious Right had their way:\n \n * they would turn our nation into a \"Christians only\" theocracy everyone would pay tithes in addition to taxes\n * they'd take away the freedom of speech\n * they'd remove a woman's right to choose to have an abortion\n * they'd make it difficult to obtain reliable birth control\n * they'd attempt to frighten children with inaccuracies about sex, disease, and pregnancy\n * they'd take away the right to bear arms because too many \"sinners\" would have guns\n * they'd bring religion into schools and teach it openly\n * they'd denounce evolution and return us to a point where nobody challenged \"creation science\"\n * Fear and paranoia would reign supreme\n * Anyone who didn't \"toe the line\" would be suspect and probably ostracized from society\n * Atheism, paganism, and even agnosticism would be deemed illegal\n * All forms of art, pornography, and free expression would be struck down\n * You'd be told what you could see on television and movies, what you could read, what you could do with your life, and how you would live\n \n Sounds extremist, even down right fascist, doesn't it? Yet these are the things you hear the Religious Right denouncing and attacking every day. What they really want is control and power over everything we see, hear, do, and think. They pass it off as \"protecting children,\" or \"keeping us morally upright,\" or some other nonsense. They actually believe that we already are a Christian nation, when in fact we are supposed to be a secular one. The thing they all seem to forget is this country was founded by secularists: The first 6 Presidents of the United States weren't even Christians, they were Diests. One of our most beloved Presidents, Abraham Lincoln, didn't believe in the Christian God at all, he merely paid lip service to it because he had to as President, but his private papers and eyewitnesses peg him as an outright Atheist! So many famous Americans were non-believers it is funny that these aspects are simply \"whitewashed\" by the so-called \"moral majority\". Today it is still somewhat dangerous to voice one's non-belief because the old 19th century religious hysteria has been stirred up once again in our country. I think it's time we pulled the curtain down and exposed the \"wizard\" behind it. Smoke and mirrors don't hide the fact that \"organized religion\" is up to its ears in politics regardless of any high and mighty speeches about the \"Separation of Church and State.\" Get the hell out of politics! All organized religion does is add fuel to the fire of an already corrupt and damaged system.\n \n Finally, Western religion gives people comfort. In the old days, when cave man Zok couldn't explain why his buddy Vek got crushed by a falling rock, he decided the \"God of the Falling Rocks must have been angry with him.\" As we evolved, we began to realize that gravity and being in the wrong place at the wrong time had more to do with it than anything else. Every age has its mysteries, and every age has its Gods and Goddesses to control those mysteries. As we became more and more enlightened by science and reason, we found we didn't need that many deities to explain the universe away. So like every civilization which survived, we gradually moved from many gods (polytheism) to one god (monotheism). Now when someone we care for dies unexpectedly, it's \"God's Will.\" When a 6 month old baby chokes on a piece of pretzel and dies in his grandmother's arms, this must be \"God's Will.\" When a fanatic blows up a Federal Building killing over a hundred innocent people, this too is \"God's Will.\" As a matter of fact, if you believe God to be omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and immortal, then everything is Her will. She already knows how the whole thing is going to go down anyway, so you may as well just let the autopilot run your life, you never have to worry about a thing. She already knows you will either go to heaven or hell, will or will not sin, will or will not marry, have children, live to see grandchildren, or die tomorrow. There is no reason to live. Oh don't try to sell me that bologna about the tree of knowledge of good and evil. If eating the apple was all that powerful then Adam and Eve wouldn't have needed any more instruction. Tell me why this is so? Why is it that eating this apple didn't remove Adam and Eve's need to know any more about God and religion? It seems to me that it wasn't all that great after all. At any rate, one of the last great questions of the universe is where we go when we die. Religion lets us believe that our dearly departed loved ones are \"up there watching\" us even now (perhaps some of them are \"down there roasting\" too). What a tremendous relief it must be to know that when we die we don't simply cease to exist! We can prance about with our immortal souls and go to heaven like good little children of God. Hogwash! If you bought the whole bit about God being omniscient, omnipresent, omnibenevolent, and immortal, and you believe you have an immortal soul as well, I have a bridge I'd love to sell you. Cash only, and in small bills. Give it up folks, why is it so hard to face that chances are just as even that when we die, we die, that's it, game over, no refund, no deposit, no return. Face your mortality and get on with living. You'll be happier, trust me.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that religion is nothing more than superstitious bunk. People choose to believe in order to gain power and peddle influence, seek comfort from death, and cultivate wealth. Some sick individuals use religion as an excuse to do unspeakable horror and cruelty to their fellow man. In the end religion is simply another human tool or ploy to bilk people of their money and control them. Snake oil salesmen were much more honest than most religious organizations. I believe that if you live your life as good as you can and try not to hurt anyone, and spread love wherever possible, you can do greater good than most organized religions ever manage to accomplish. Use your own mind. When you let anyone else do your thinking for you, whether it be religion or something else, you are just acting lazy.\n \n Original Author: J.S. Brown\n Edited by Rational Response Squad\n \n CHRISTIANITY:\n The belief that some cosmic Jewish zombie can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him that you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree.

   "People who do evil in the name of Christ / Christianity have only themselves to blame. It's not the fault of the Christian religion or the New Testament. The teachings of Christ are clear that you are to love God and your fellow man. Every evil committed on the face of the earth is the result of people VIOLATING the teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\n \n Exactly.. And here's some of the things Jebus did .. Leading those religious fanatics to believe it was ok to Do bad things. Love was the last thing Jebus wanted to teach about. If he was even real he was a self centered, jealous, disgruntled man who was as delusional as the people who follow him today.\n \n Jebus:\n \n Advocates child abuse and murder amongst many other cruelties.\n \n Christians are always claiming, \"he's the lamb\", \"our savior\", \"the king of peace\", \"the embodiment of love\", amongst the many other names they associate with a loving, merciful nature. Jesus a nice guy? Not in my book. Nor in any other person's who is capable of compassion and rationality. Let's examine who the hell the Jesus character really is. These verses will show not only is Jesus' \"loving\" nature a joke but so are the Christians who worship him. Jesus' real mission to come to earth:\n \n Jesus says that he has come to destroy families by making family members hate each other. He has \"come not to send peace, but a sword.\" Matthew 10:34\n \n Jesus says, \"Don't imagine that I came to bring peace on earth! No, rather a sword lf you love your father, mother, sister, brother, more than me, you are not worthy of being mine. \"The real beauty of this verse is that Jesus demands people truly love him more then they love their own family. I ask you how can we love someone that we can not see or interact with? Love is an emotion pertaining to physical existence not to faithful ideologies, yet God threatens you with Death just because your love for your mother maybe stronger than your love for him. Matthew 10:34\n \n Families will be torn apart because of Jesus. \"Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.\" Matthew 10:21\n \n Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets. He hasn't the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament. Matthew 5:17\n \n \n \n Jesus advocates murder and death:\n \n Jesus condemns entire cities to dreadful deaths and to the eternal torment of hell because they didn't care for his preaching. Matthew 11:20\n \n Jesus, whose clothes are dipped in blood, has a sharp sword sticking out of his mouth. Thus attired, he treads the winepress of the wrath of God. (The winepress is the actual press that humans shall be put into so that we may be ground up.) Revelations 19:13-15\n \n The beast and the false prophet are cast alive into a lake of fire. The rest of us the unchosen will be killed with the sword of Jesus. \"An all the fowls were filled with their flesh.\" Revelations 19:20-21\n \n \n \n Jesus says he is the only way to salvation yet he purposely disillusions us so that we will go to hell:\n \n Jesus explains that the reason he speaks in parables is so that no one will understand him, \"lest . . . they . . . should understand . . . and should be converted, and I should heal them.\" Matthew 13:10-15\n \n Jesus explains why he speaks in parables to confuse people so they will go to hell. Mark 4:11-12\n \n \n \n Jesus advocates child abuse:\n \n Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not killing disobedient children according to the commandment: \"He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.\" Matthew 15:4-7\n \n Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he'll give your a big reward. Jesus asks that his followers abandon their children to follow him. To leave your child is abuse, it's called neglect, pure and simple. Matthew 19:29\n \n Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children according to Old Testament law. Mark 7:9\n \n \n \n A few other things about Jesus:\n \n Jesus says that those who have been less fortunate in this life will have it even worse in the life to come. Mark 4:25\n \n Jesus sends the devils into 2000 pigs, causing them to jump off a cliff and be drowned in the sea. Clearly Jesus could have simply sent the devils out, yet he chose instead to place them into pigs and kill them. This is called animal abuse. Mark 5:12-13\n \n Jesus kills a fig tree for not bearing figs, even though it was out of season. Jesus must not be as smart as Christians would have us believe, for he was retarded enough to do something this silly. You'd think the son of god (god incarnate) would know that trees don't bear fruit in dry season. Mark 11:13\n \n Luke 12:47 Jesus okays beating slaves.",

   "No, we know the scriptures aren't the cause, otherwise Christians everywhere (some more adherent than the fundies) would be doing these things. There's something about a fundie that draws them to these passages in particular, not the other way around. Writings have no will of their own; Mein Kampf doesn't make people go out and become white supremacists. The extremist does that because he's an extremist and he's looking for an excuse of justification.\n \n Add that to the fact there is plenty in the same Bible to make it clear it is now very WRONG to do those things, under the teachings of Jesus. Christianity is clearly against the items in the parade of horribles you mention.\n\n \n The reason Christians everywhere don't do these things is because of secularism. If you go back through history, you see that the death penalty was extremely common-place in Europe and early America for things that in modern times is only seen in Islamic theocracies. \n \n Look at the well documented history of witch hunts in America and Europe, for example. (You have to also remember that all the way up through the 1800's, Christians believed every bit as much in witchcraft, sorcery, demons, and spirits as they did in Jesus' resurrection.)\n \n Witch-hunt - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Or homosexuality.\n \n \nMost anti-sodomy laws in Western countries originated from a Christian world-view established from the Bible. The New Testament has been said to condemn Sodomy; {Romans 1:24, 26-28} In England, Henry VIII introduced the first legislation under English criminal law against sodomy with the Buggery Act of 1533, making buggery punishable by hanging, a penalty not lifted until 1861.\n\n \n Sodomy law - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Even blasphemy.\n \n \nLaws regarding the death penalty varied from colony to colony. The Massachusetts Bay Colony held its first execution in 1630, even though the Capital Laws of New England did not go into effect until years later. The New York Colony instituted the Duke's Laws of 1665. Under these laws, offenses such as striking one's mother or father, or denying the \"true God,\" were punishable by death. (Randa, 1997)\n\n \n Part I: History of the Death Penalty | Death Penalty Information Center\n \n These things were illegal, and many punishable by death, up until pretty recent times. Much like slavery, scripture was used to keep these practices in place.\n \n The scripture wasn't the reason these laws have been repealed; it was rational and secular thinking. \n \n Plus, the New Testament makes it clear that the Old Testament's laws are eternal, not to be thrown aside as you would have me believe:\n \n Matthew 5:17-19\n \n17Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.\n \n 18For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\n \n 19Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. \n \n \n Luke 16:17\n \nAnd it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.\n\n \n Mark 7:9-13, Jesus speaking\n \n9And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.\n \n 10For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:\n \n 11But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.\n \n 12And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;\n \n 13Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.\n",

Ironically (to your assertions), the Christian religion itself tempered the death penalty a great deal.\n\n \n I agree with you on the extent that the Death Penalty and Laws/Punishments did not originate from religion. There where other Codes of Law that predated The Code of Hammurabi.. But it is apparent that each new Code of Law was merely a new Version of Laws passed down from one generation to the next and re-written to fit whatever society that Law was being written for. \n \n The Code of Ur-Nammu is the oldest known tablet containing a law code surviving today. It was written in the Sumerian language circa 2100 BC-2050 BC . Although the preface directly credits the laws to king Ur-Nammu of Ur (2112-2095 BC), some historians think they should rather be ascribed to his son Shulgi.\n \n The first copy of the code, in two fragments found at Nippur, was translated by Samuel Kramer in 1952; owing to its partial preservation, only the prologue and 5 of the laws were discernible[1]. Further tablets were found in Ur and translated in 1965, allowing some 40 of the 57 laws to be reconstructed.[2] Another copy found in Sippar contains slight variants.\n \n Although it is known that earlier law-codes existed, such as the Code of Urukagina, this represents the earliest legal text that is extant. It predated the Code of Hammurabi by some three centuries.\n \n The laws are arranged in casuistic form of if-(crime), then-(punishment) &#8212; a pattern to be followed in nearly all subsequent codes. For the oldest extant law-code known to history, it is considered remarkably advanced, because it institutes fines of monetary compensation for bodily damage, as opposed to the later lex talionis (&#8216;eye for an eye&#8217;) principle of Babylonian law; however, murder, robbery, adultery and rape were capital offenses.\n \n The code reveals a glimpse at societal structure during the \"Sumerian Renaissance\". Beneath the lu-gal (\"great man\" or king), all members of society belonged to one of two basic strata: The \"lu\" or free person, and the slave (male, arad; female geme). The son of a lu was called a dumu-nita until he married, becoming a \"young man\" (gurus). A woman (munus) went from being a daughter (dumu-mi), to a wife (dam), then if she outlived her husband, a widow (nu-ma-su) who could remarry.\n \n Code of Ur-Nammu - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian law code, dating to ca. 1700 BCE\n The Code of Hammurabi was one of several sets of laws in the Ancient Near East.\n \n Earlier collections of laws include the Code of Ur-Nammu, king of Ur (ca. 2050 BCE), the Laws of Eshnunna (ca. 1930 BCE) and the codex of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (ca. 1870 BCE), while later ones include the Hittite laws, the Assyrian laws, and Mosaic Law. These codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area, and they have passages which resemble each other.\n Figures at top of stele \"fingernail\" above Hammurabi's code of laws.\n Side view of the stele \"fingertip\".\n \n The code has been seen as an example of even a king not being able to change fundamental laws concerning the governing of a country which was the primitive form of what is now known as a constitution.However, this interpretation may be anachronistic. The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of presumption of innocence, and it also suggests that the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide evidence.The Code's provisions do not cover important areas of law and commerce. The occasional nature of many provisions indicates that the Code may be better read as a codification of supplementary judicial decisions of the king. Rather than being a modern legal code or constitution, it may have as its purpose the self-glorification of Hammurabi by memorializing his wisdom and justice. Its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.\n \n Religion basically entered the picture with the Mosaic Laws.. The Ones Moses claimed were written by God. IN fact these Laws were basically copied from previous codes and some were dropped or changed to fit Moses' specific Ideas of what Law and Punishment should be. These were not written by God, they were copied from Man. \n \n \n Mosaic Law(1312 BCE)\n The Book of Kings relates how a \"law of Moses\" was discovered in the Temple during the reign of king Josiah (r. 641&#8211;609 BC). This book is mostly identified as an early version of the Book of Deuteronomy, perhaps chapters 5-26 and chapter 28 of the extant text. This text contains a number of laws, dated to the 8th century BC kingdom of Judah, a time when a minority Yahwist faction was actively attacking mainstream polytheism, succeeding in establishing official monolatry of the God of Israel under Josiah by the late 7th century BC.\n The law attributed to Moses, specifically the laws set out in Deuteronomy, as a consequence came to be considered supreme over all other sources of authority (the king and his officials), and the Levite priests were the guardians and interpreters of the law.[68]\n The Book of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 31:9 and Deuteronomy 31:24&#8211;26) describes how Moses writes \"torah\" (instruction) on a scroll and lays it beside the ark of the Covenant.[69] Similar passages include, for example, Exodus 17:14, \"And YHWH said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven;\" Exodus 24:4, \"And Moses wrote all the words of YHWH, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel;\" Exodus 34:27, \"And Yahweh said unto Moses, Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel;\"[70] and Leviticus 26:46 \"These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the LORD established on Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses.\"\n Based on this tradition, \"Mosaic law\" came to refer to the entire legal content of the Pentateuch, not just the Ten Commandments explicitly connected to Moses in the biblical narrative. The content of this law was excerpted and codified in Rabbinical Judaism as the 613 Mitzvot. By Late Antiquity, the tradition of Moses being the source of the law in the Pentateuch also gave rise to the tradition of Mosaic authorship, the interpretation of the entire Torah as the work of Moses.\n \n Moses - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n Other Codes of Law that Predated Mosaic Law\n \n Code of the Nesilim (c. 1650-1500 BC)\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_the_Nesilim\n \n Code of Urukagina (2,380-2,360 BC)\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urukagina\n \n And one I found that came after Mosaic Law\n \n The Code of the Assura, c. 1075 BCE\n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.html",

Ironically (to your assertions), the Christian religion itself tempered the death penalty a great deal.\n\n \n You completely missed the point. I never said, nor meant to imply, that the death penalty was a religious idea. The death penalty was created by man, just like discrimination and bigotry, and just like religion. I wasn't even making a statement against the death penalty. \n \n The point was that the scriptures command the death penalty for so called 'sins' that you said true Christians would be opposed to, despite Christians only becoming opposed to these ideas over the past 100-200 years. \n \n \n \nIndeed these are cases where religion intersected law, but it does nothing to prove that \"Without religion, that would never have happened.\" which was your original assertion for this exchange.

Your position doesn't take into account a number of factors, such as a.) non-religious people do bad things too, and b.) the fact that many of the bad things theists do VIOLATE religion at times.\n\n \n Homophobia, sexism, racism, and similar ideas all predate religion. They were, however, integrated into religion, and into sacred texts, which have promoted these things and kept the bigotry alive and well even in modern times. \n \n Without religion, there would still be bad people and bigotry, I have never stated otherwise, but religion is responsible for making it more widespread. And certainly without religion, blasphemy and religious sectarianism would not exist. \n \n Man is the cause of both evil and religion, and it is my contention that religion has caused more harm than good, and that the world would be a better place if people stopped being so superstitious. It would by no means be a perfect world, and there would still probably be plenty of evil, but religion has historically been a major hurdle to advancement of science, medicine, and tolerance in the world. \n \n \nScriptures certainly were an influence and therefore part of the reason for them being repealed--it's a well known fact that one of the biggest influences on the abolitionist movement was the Christian religion. Abolitionists like W.Wilberforce, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and William Lloyd Garrison made it clear that their religious beliefs were profoundly behind their abolitionist views. The social justice movement has long been a product of religion.\n \n Martin Luther King Jr. is another, more recent example of this.\"Dr. King often pointed out that it was Jesus' Sermon on the Mount that inspired the \"dignified social action\" of the civil rights movement. His notion of \"creative suffering\" - borne by civil rights activists who endured persecution and police brutality - came from his Christian faith in the redemptive suffering of Jesus.\" (Martin Luther King and the Bible)We need to remember that religion and reason are not an either/or relationship; to assume such is to begin with an unfounded premise. There is no inverse-proportionality going on between the two. Some of the most reasoned thinkers in history were religious.\n\n \n Certainly there were religious people who were abolitionists and major parts of the civil rights movement. Religion can do good. That doesn't change the fact that the bible was used to support slavery up until the bitter end of the Confederacy. There were also plenty of secular abolitionists (Thomas Paine immediately comes to mind) and secular civil rights leaders (A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin). Honestly, though, none of this is really related to the original argument. \n \n \n \nNot in the sense of punishment, which is the real issue here. Jesus let the adulteress walk away from capital punishment, remember? The part of the law he told her to keep was the rule against adultery itself, by saying 'go and sin no more.'\n\n \n I know you won't believe me, but the \"cast the first stone\" story is generally accepted as a forgery, added to the gospel of John much later. In any case, it is faulty reasoning, as it implies that a person must be perfect in order to punish someone else. \n \n \nAlthough in line with many stories in the Gospels and probably primitive (Didascalia Apostolorum refers to it, possibly Papias also), most scholars[2][3] agree that it was \"certainly not part of the original text of St John's Gospel.\"[4]\n\n \n Jesus and the woman taken in adultery - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Plus, the quote in my last post from Mark 7:10 showed Jesus criticizing Pharisees for not killing the children who cursed their parents. Seems a bit contradictory to me.",

I have never claimed it was important to be born An Atheist, but I do believe that we are all born Atheist. A new born baby has no knowledge of the world around him so he isn't able to form an opinion, or form a belief. Having an absence of belief IMO would define him as an Atheist. \n I think it would be more important not as to whether he is born an Atheist but what happens after, and whether or not he/she will stay an atheist. When you teach a child that God is in heaven and he gave us this book of rules to follow, and if you stray from these rules then you will burn for eternity.. Well You strip this child of his ability to think for himself and choose his/her own destiny. \n \n So I don't know if there is any importance in being born an Atheist.. it just happens to be. I would think if it was possible for a child to be born religious then there might be some importance in being born Atheist. But Children are taught religion by those closest to them.. most often their Parents. If a Child came out of the womb religious then that child would already not be born with the ability to think for himself. The religion would be imprinted on his mind at birth, so what incentive would he have to explore life on his own, God has already promised him everything he will ever need.\n \n Maybe being born Atheist is just Natures way of giving a new born a fighting chance.

There is absolutely no scientific proof of a 'gay gene,'\" said Family Research Council Policy Analyst Yvette Cantu Thursday. \n \n A study conducted in 1993 by openly \"gay\" activist and researcher Dr. Dean Hamer of the National Cancer Institute examined the X chromosomes of 40 pairs of homosexual brothers. The study, which appeared in the March 1993 issue of the journal Science, found that 33 of the pairs of brothers had genetic markers for male homosexuality. \n \n A new study attempting to replicate Hamer's was released today by the same Science magazine, discrediting the 1993 study. The study conducted by scientists from the Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences at the University of Western Ontario and the Department of Genetics at Stanford Medical School concluded that \"data do not support the presence of a gene of large effect influencing sexual orientation.\" \n \n [Added by Zorba]It must also be noted that Hamers 93 study was accepted in and published in the Journal Science, a peer reviewed magazine which is considered a legitimate and serious source for scientific discoveries. \n \n The Boston Globe reported in February that the media-ballyhooed \"gay gene\" theory was already in trouble. The Globe article featured the findings of Dr. Richard Pillard, a professor of psychiatry at Boston University's School of Medicine, whose twin studies showed \"that sexuality is greatly influenced by environment, and that the role of genetics is, in the end, limited.\" \n \n \"These findings confirm what I've seen in my own life as well as in the lives of thousands and thousands of people who have left the lifestyle,\" said Cantu. \"I am living proof that homosexuality is not an immutable characteristic. Hamer himself has said that lesbianism is 'culturally transmitted, not inherited ... It's more environmental than genetic, more nurture than nature.' Will these recent studies force Hamer to concede that male homosexuality is also not a matter of genetics but of environment? \n \n \"This new study reveals that Hamer's activism got in the way of his ability to remain unbiased about his research,\" said Cantu. \" 'Gay' activists have used Hamer's research to promote everything from 'gay' marriage to 'hate crimes' legislation. However, Science's study further undermines any attempt to change public policy in his name.\" \n No \"homosexual gene\" can be found, new study says.",

   "Here is an interesting clip of Dawkins interviewing the Archbishop of Canterbury; this is a good example of how religious people are thinkers and questioners as well, and often there is very little that atheists bring up that theists have not long already personally dealt with. Certainly the atheist holds no corner on reason. Rowan Williams has no trouble dealing with his arguments. A lot of what he answers here, very successfully IMO, are things often argued by anti-theists right here on this forum. (Dawkins is far calmer here than he is in some of his 'livelier' debates, and it is refreshing. I think he and other atheists would find far more success at gaining dialog with the calm and reasoned approach)\n\n \n A fascinating trio of clips. I know you and I don't often agree, but I do thank you for posting these.\n \n One thing that struck me, though, was just how much Archbishop Williams concedes, in terms of evolution and atheism. Right from the opening of the first clip, he's acknowledging the veracity of biological evolution in Darwinian terms (though not of Spencer's \"social Darwinism\"). He notes that the opening of chapters of Genesis were interpreted non-literally as early as the second century. And his theological criticisms of creationism were quite excellent.\n \n Moreover, when discussing the atheistic view of the universe alongside the Christian or the Buddhist, Williams even concedes that the one is not necessarily better or worse in terms of subjective consolation than the other. This is an awful lot to concede! Were more Christians making such concessions, the current confrontations would probably never have started in the first place.\n \n I didn't find the Archbishop terribly convincing when Dawkins pressed him on the disconnect between clergy and theologians on the one hand and laity on the other. I would agree that many congregants are more sophisticated than is often presumed. That said, if history is any guide people's intelligence should be neither under- nor over-estimated.\n \n I also didn't find his claims for what miracles he accepts terribly satisfying, either. The virgin birth is quite notorious on this score, and the Archbishop did not explain the basis for its veracity! He explained why the author of Matthew believed it to be true (reliance on a tradition), but not why that tradition's claims are themselves true. As Dawkins later points out, dealing with it as a story with a meaning is one thing, but claiming a fact is another. And (if memory serves), that led into Williams weakest moment of all, when he conceded a circularity in the fundamental argument. He claimed it wasn't vicious, but didn't do much to explain why it wasn't.\n \n That said, the nature of miracles in Williams view was oddly compelling to me. It reminded me of Catholic biologist Ken Miller, for whom the intrinsic uncertainties of quantum mechanics open a realm for the supernatural to impact the world, without undoing it's law-governed character.\n \n Where I found Williams most impressive was on the \"god of the gaps\" issue. His distinction between fundamental limits to understanding and contingent gaps in understanding was excellent. And although I am an atheist like Dawkins, I would disagree with him about God's existence belonging to the second category. I would simply say that it is literally incoherent to claim any knowledge about a being -- including even that such a being exists at all -- if, ex hypothesi, that being must exist beyond the fundamental limits of our knowledge! Some people might find it subjectively valuable to believe so, but it certainly isn't a matter of objective inquiry at that point.\n \n And then there's the \"problem of evil,\" which they didn't address at all....\n \n So I'm ultimately unconvinced. I wouldn't say that the Archbishop \"handled\" all criticisms well, if that is to mean that he solved them or gave adequate responses to them. On the other hand, he did a great job of knocking down the idea that religion is inherently irrational, simply by engaging in the discussion so well in the first place!\n \n Anyway, this is the sort of debate and discussion I love, and I thank you again for posting it.",

I think a lot more religious people are than many people realize. The whole debate suffers from the 'squeaky-wheel' syndrome--that because a small group (fundies) are the loudest, they give the illusion they are bigger than they really are. The press tends to play up extremes of an issue: they'll interview someone like Falwell (who's dead now, of course) and then someone like Hitchens, when in fact most people are far, far center from both of them. And yes, I realize that over half of Americans poll that they believe in YEC, but my view is that most of them do so mostly because they really just don't care that much, and that's the view they grew up with so they just sort of go with it. It's not something they consider a major issue, and frankly, they are probably right that it's not.\n \n \nMoreover, when discussing the atheistic view of the universe alongside the Christian or the Buddhist, Williams even concedes that the one is not necessarily better or worse in terms of subjective consolation than the other. This is an awful lot to concede! Were more Christians making such concessions, the current confrontations would probably never have started in the first place.\n\n \n But for Dawkins, that shouldn't matter anyway. He doesn't believe in ANY theism. The only thing the Archbishop's 'concession' shows is that this is simply atheism versus theism, rather than one given religion. \n \n \nI also didn't find his claims for what miracles he accepts terribly satisfying, either. The virgin birth is quite notorious on this score, and the Archbishop did not explain the basis for its veracity! He explained why the author of Matthew believed it to be true (reliance on a tradition), but not why that tradition's claims are themselves true.\n\n \n That's a fair point, though I've always thought it was odd when skeptics zero in on the virgin birth as opposed to other miracles, because compared to others, it has been shown to exist in nature from time to time. Unlike, say, the resurrection. \n \n I also found it odd that one of the things Dawkins complained about at one point was the fact that Williams, in his writings, started with a presupposition that God exists. But that is in fact the whole point of the debate: Dawkins himself starts with a presupposition that there is no God.\n \n \nThat said, the nature of miracles in Williams view was oddly compelling to me. It reminded me of Catholic biologist Ken Miller, for whom the intrinsic uncertainties of quantum mechanics open a realm for the supernatural to impact the world, without undoing it's law-governed character.\n\n \n I agree; what's interesting to me too is that when you boil down some of the arguments atheists make for very difficult-to-explain phenomenon, they become about as far-fetched as the idea of a creator anyway. Particularly when you start getting into time, relativity, things like worm-holes, alternate realities, etc. \n \n \nWhere I found Williams most impressive was on the \"god of the gaps\" issue.

And frankly I think virulently opposing YECism is an example of over-reactive paranoia. In cases where evolution is being pushed OUT, then it's a problem. But IMO there shouldn't be this effort to sanitize school of the idea that creationism is a factor. To me that smacks of putting one's head in the sand that the jury is still out on many of these issues.\n \n \nThis short Hitchens clip is a pretty interesting and different take on the virgin birth and resurrection. \n \n YouTube - Hitchslap 7 - It's called faith because it's not knowledge\n\n \n What I don't get is why someone who is supposedly trying to get to the science of something would even be concerned with whether or not the 'Divine' is what's behind parthenogenesis or not. Hitchens admits there that the idea of a virgin birth is possible. So he attacks a straw man instead: that it doesn't prove it's divine. My question would be, 'so what?' Why would he even be concerned with THAT question? It seems to me it's irrelevant what force or cause is behind something. To use another example, who CARES what was the cause of the big bang? The important thing is acknowledging that it happened. Again, why do anti-theists always go after the virgin birth when there are other miracles that are much easier to attack?\n \n \nWormholes are hypothetically allowed by relativity, but never have been observed and are understandably considered far-fetched. Parallel universes are also completely hypothetical as well. I don't know that wormholes or even parallel universes really try to explain anything, but even so scientists will admit that there is a lot that we don't know.\n\n \n The point is that anti-theists are far more tolerant of these hypotheticals than something ALSO far-fetched. They just don't like the idea that an intelligent being is behind the universe coming into existence because it happens to involve the \"R\" word (\"religion\"). It's an irrational double-standard on the part of anti-theists. It's sort of humorous--you can remove the word 'supernatural' or 'religious' and use the SAME arguments but instead call it 'an intelligence' or 'advanced being or civilization' instead of \"GOD\" and suddenly they're not so reactionary about it and are suddenly more tolerant toward it. Even though it's pretty much the same thing. emoticon_xangel SO clearly, it's a hangup they have with religion and not really science that motivates them.\n \n \nAn atheist is a person that isn't a theist.\n \n \n In the rare cases that happens, yes.

But it's not. I think the more pertinent problem here is that you're applying science toward something that's not a scientific issue to begin with. Religion falls under the auspices of the non-observable. It falls under the realm of ethics, philosophy, and so forth. There are not tangible concrete things--they are matters of concept and ideals. Science demanding evidence from religion is a case of one type of thought demanding another completely DIFFERENT type of thought to exist only under the former's auspices. You can't prove God exists/doesn't-exist because it's in the realm of the unprovable. The unknowable. It's not that it is NOT observed--it's rather than it is un-observable. So basically, I think the whole idea that there has to be evidence for religion is a very flawed idea to begin with. There are plenty of things we don't put in an evidentiary category to begin with, and it's only in relatively recent history that skeptics have started demanding scientific evidence from religion.\n \n Furthermore, it seems very odd to me that you all would make an issue of religion being irrational for this reason when in fact you don't make an issue of this over much else. There's something quite cold and sterile about a human race that would never entertain or believe in something just because it doesn't fall under certain evidence requirements of science. We would never have philosophy and art the human experience if everything required cold, calculating scientific evidence. (Not to mention you make no statement over WHO gets to set those evidentiary standards for everyone else. It's as much about HOW evidence is interpreted as anything.)\n \n Finally, perhaps the biggest and most glaring hole in your logic is that many would argue that there certainly IS plenty of evidence for theism, many of the very same evidences you give to disprove it can also apply toward believing in the existence of a creator. (The teleological argument, for example.) Obviously many in the world (the theists) disagree with the way you interpret the evidence, because they've come to different conclusions than you. (Please don't tell me you're one of those people who think religious people don't weigh evidence.)\n \n \nand the fact that some religious people (not all, before you start) will act on terrible things and believe in terrible things due to exactly the same religious faith is enough to declare religion to be more than unnecessary, but can potentially be dangerous\n\n \n Anything could be \"potentially dangerous\", so I'm not sure that phrase really means anything. For instance, a person could conceivably attack someone out of anti-theism, and therefore it too is \"potentially dangerous.\" So that is such a wide-open concept that it is meaningless. Unless you're out to either a.) discourage something because it's \"potentially dangerous\" (in which case MUCH more SPECIFIC quantifying needs to be done), or b.) ban something because it's \"potentially dangerous\", such concerns seem, frankly, irrelevant to me.\n \n By analogy, patriotism can be \"potentially dangerous.\" Who would disagree with that?? No one is going to disagree that religion is \"potentially dangerous\" in the sense that anything could be so. It's a meaningless point unless one can narrow it down to more specific behavior WITHIN patriotism or religion that is dangerous. After all, we aren't going to ban patriotism. Just as we aren't going to ban religion--it's impossible to BAN someone from believing something. Unless you've invented a mind control device, this is a very moot conversation.\n \n \n, and it is not unreasonable to be against the entire idea of faith without evidence, because that may lead people to doing scary things.\n\n \n Yes, it is very unreasonable, because association is not the same as CAUSE. \n \n \nis this enough to call religion \"bad\"? no, in my opinion, religion is not always responsible, bad people who just happen to be religious do bad things and their religious beliefs are unjustly blamed. is belief without evidence enough to be against religion? yes it is.\n\n \n Again, I think you are operating off a rather poor presupposition in assuming that religious people believe without evidence with much frequency. Given that, I don't have any problem with your statement. Belief without evidence at least CAN be bad, but IMO most religious people DO base their decision to enter/stay with their religion on evidence. People generally either a.) go through times of questioning and doubt where they DO weigh evidence, or b.) in cases of later conversion they become religious based on personal and non-personal evidence.\n \n \nin the world according to an anti-theist, a world without religion, people would no longer have faith-based excuses for doing or believing in terrible things, and on the other hand, they wont have faith based excuses for doing good things, like religious charity organizations. \n\n \n So at worst, it would be a wash. Therefore since we should value personal freedom, we shouldn't pass judgment on people who are religious for being religious.",

   "\n \n\n \n In that clip Hitchens was replying to (and destroying) a guy who stated that if Jesus was born of a virgin then that made Jesus' claims true. It wasn't a strawman, it was the guy's argument. Hitchens isn't really a scientific guy either.\n \n The reason atheists are more tolerant of hypotheticals is because those hypotheticals aren't being touted as fact, aren't being used to control people, or anything like that. They are simply labeled as ideas, which will be completely discarded if contradictory evidence is found. The same can't be said for religion. And any hypothesis involving 'advanced' or 'intelligent' non-humans will be met with a lot of skepticism. \n \n Also, you keep saying things like \"that's only the fundies,\" as if those complaints against religion aren't valid since tolerant, moderates don't do those things... But religion creates those fundamentalists; and there are millions of them. And even a lot of religious moderates do harm with things like circumcision and opposing condom use and sex ed. \n \n With all the talk of evidence and stuff... I do think that evidence and skepticism should be used when looking at any idea or belief.\n \n But the idea of a god that intervenes is NOT intangible.

   "I know, that's why I pointed out that someone who's JUST an atheist is very rare. I'm glad you agree though that the two go hand-in-hand, and so it's rarely just atheism that's going on with these people. Your post exemplifies anti-theism quite well, due to the irrational generalization you made that religion is bad. In this way, anti-theist undercut their self-claim to 'reason', because generalizations are not reasonable.\n\n \n It is not Irrational to claim that Religion is Bad. Historical Evidence can prove the Danger of religion , what is irrational is denying that this is true. I don't have anything against religious people in general, My problem is with RELIGION. Religion is based on blind faith, there is absolutely NO evidence to support the Idea of A supernatural Deity. Science is about forming theory, building models to test such theory, This can't be done with religion. The religious side has been trying for years to include Science into their religion for the sole purpose of getting creation back into school teachings. There is nothing scientific about believing in a fairy tale only because a single work of literature claims it's real. It can be shown in history that Christianity is borrowed from earlier religious beliefs.. but the Religion teaches otherwise. So I'm perfectly justified in my generalization that religion is dangerous and bad for humankind. I will admit there is an upside to religion, but it doesn't change my view that religion is far more dangerous than it is good.",

   " My problem is with RELIGION. Religion is based on blind faith, there is absolutely NO evidence to support the Idea of A supernatural Deity.\n\n \n Yeah, there is too. Read the Bible, and specifically the New Testament.\n \n Here's another one for you to ignore or sweep under the rug:\n \n The Scarlet Cloth / Thread \n Quoted from JCNT:84, re: Mt 27.51: \n \n \"The parokhet in the Temple. Exodus 26:31-35 describes this curtain as it existed in the desert Tabernacle. It separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. Only the cohen hagadol was allowed to pass through it into the Holy of Holies; and that he could do only once a year, on Yom-Kippur, to make an atonement sacrifice for his sins and for the sins of the Jewish people. When it was ripped in two from top to bottom it symbolized the fact that God was giving everyone access to the most holy place of all in heaven, as taught explicitly at MJ 9:3-9, 10:19-22... \n \n The Talmud bears an amazing witness to the work of Yeshua in altering the system of atonement. The background is that on Yom-Kippur, when the cohen hagadol sacrificed a bull (Leviticus 16), a piece of scarlet cloth was tied between its horns. If it later turned white, it meant that God had forgiven Israel's sin in accordance with Isaiah 1:18, \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they will be white as snow.\"\n \n \"Our Rabbis taught that throughout the forty years that Shim'on the Tzaddik served,... the scarlet cloth would become white. From then on it would sometimes become white and sometimes not.... Throughout the last forty years before the Temple was destroyed... the scarlet cloth never turned white.\" (Yoma 39a-39b) \n \n Thus in the days of Shim'on Tzaddik the sacrificial system established by God in the Tanakh was observed, and it was effective. But afterwards Israel's spirituality declined, so that the sacrificial system was effective only sometimes. Finally, after Yeshua's death, forty years before the destruction of the Temple, it was never effective. The Talmud does not say it, but what had become effective for forgiving Israel's sin was the sacrificial death of Yeshua the Messiah.\" \n \n http://www.christian-thinktank.com/dveil.html",

   "Well he's a theistic evolutionist. (as am I, by the way.) From what I understand The RC pope is also. I think a lot more religious people are than many people realize.\n\n \n That's definitely true! My parents, my siblings and their families, and most of my aunts and uncles and their families, are all theistic evolutionists. Very many people I went to church with growing up were, too. It's a far more common position than is ordinarily acknowledged. And it's a lot more nuanced than naive creationism, which is probably why...\n \n \nThe whole debate suffers from the 'squeaky-wheel' syndrome--that because a small group (fundies) are the loudest, they give the illusion they are bigger than they really are. The press tends to play up extremes of an issue: they'll interview someone like Falwell (who's dead now, of course) and then someone like Hitchens, when in fact most people are far, far center from both of them.\n\n \n ...this happens. Most American media outlets do a god-awful job of covering ideas. And it's not just creationism: election coverage, for example, becomes fixated on poll numbers and campaign strategies, controversies and gaffes, rather than on examining candidates' claims or explaining their policy recommendations. Fact-checking and conceptual analysis take work! So of course, something like theistic evolution gets tossed aside in the media ferment. Gotta keep it black and white!\n \n \nAnd yes, I realize that over half of Americans poll that they believe in YEC...\n\n \n Really? I thought it was more like 40-45% in most recent surveys. Not that this isn't still an alarmingly high number, of course.\n \n \n...but my view is that most of them do so mostly because they really just don't care that much, and that's the view they grew up with so they just sort of go with it. It's not something they consider a major issue, and frankly, they are probably right that it's not.\n\n \n I agree that it's not something a lot of people care about. But I disagree that it's not a major issue! We're talking about understanding the world around us, and evolution has some pretty important implications for everything from medicine to resource management. I wish more people cared! (And not just about evolution, but about educating themselves in general. But that's a story for another day.)\n \n \nBut for Dawkins, that shouldn't matter anyway. He doesn't believe in ANY theism. The only thing the Archbishop's 'concession' shows is that this is simply atheism versus theism, rather than one given religion.\n\n \n I guess what I was trying to say was a bit different. The archbishop was acknowledging that atheism is a reasonable position that works for some people. That's how I took it, and why I took it to be a major concession.\n \n \nThat's a fair point, though I've always thought it was odd when skeptics zero in on the virgin birth as opposed to other miracles, because compared to others, it has been shown to exist in nature from time to time. Unlike, say, the resurrection.\n\n \n But of course, when parthenogenesis happens in nature, it's an unfertilized egg becoming a daughter, and it's usually a daughter that's a clone of the mother. (The only exception I can think of is hymenopterans (wasps, bees, ants), where unfertilized eggs become drones.) Clearly not what is claimed to have happened in the case of the virgin birth! And in terms of a natural-scientific explanation of that idea, the major problem would be getting Jesus a Y-chromosome.\n \n Now, is it possible? I suppose, at the level of abstract conceptual possibility, yes. But it would involve a wholly unknown mechanism of which there is no evidence available before or since. So it seems a major leap (of faith?...) to accept that something like that happened. -- Especially since, as the Archbishop left untouched, the tradition from which the Matthean author drew his idea did, in fact, mistranslate the Isaian passage in question!\n \n \nI also found it odd that one of the things Dawkins complained about at one point was the fact that Williams, in his writings, started with a presupposition that God exists. But that is in fact the whole point of the debate: Dawkins himself starts with a presupposition that there is no God.\n\n \n I see your point. I think Dawkins was simply wondering, shouldn't we prove that God exists before then basing other ideas on that? i.e., isn't there something question-begging about the rest of the enterprise?\n \n But I think it's a consideration of audience, really. Presumably, the Archbishop is writing the works in question for an audience of theists. Sure, there might be other works that ought to address the issue directly. But not every work must, and if his intended audience consists of people who already believe that God exists, why waste time?\n \n It's really no different from Dawkins not making the case for evolution's occurrence at the beginning of, say, The Ancestor's Tale. He gets on with showing how life has diversified and evolved, rather than first arguing that it has, because his audience already accepts it. It could be argued that it has, of course, which Dawkins does in The Blind Watchmaker or The Greatest Show on Earth. But that argument need not be made every single time.\n \n So yes, I'd agree, this is a good point.\n \n \nI agree; what's interesting to me too is that when you boil down some of the arguments atheists make for very difficult-to-explain phenomenon, they become about as far-fetched as the idea of a creator anyway. Particularly when you start getting into time, relativity, things like worm-holes, alternate realities, etc.\n\n \n But I do think there's something different going on here. Relativity is difficult to explain, but it's not speculative: it's well-supported by both experimental evidence and mathematics. So I wouldn't say that natural-scientific explanations are \"far-fetched,\" just that they're counter-intuitive and difficult to understand.\n \n When we're talking about a space for the miraculous opening up in the intrinsic uncertainties of quantum mechanics (a la Miller), we're talking about something that is literally impossible to understand: something beyond the fundamental limits of our understanding (a la Williams) working its way into the world. What I'm thinking about is, I guess, something like the possibility that yes, things like electron positions end up being probabilistic from the point of view of nature, but there's a divine intention guiding every such seemingly random event. Such an intention is undetectable via natural science and human understanding, but there it is. It might be a little presumptuous for me to call that \"far-fetched\" -- but I'd certainly say it involves a leap of logic!\n \n And perhaps, from a religious perspective, that's okay. A leap of faith, that is irrational -- in the sense of \"non-rational,\" not necessarily in the sense of being \"anti-rational.\"\n \n \nI would say that view qualifies you for being an agnostic (as opposed to atheist).\n\n \n Ah, but I don't believe in God! That's atheism.\n \n All I'd say about that is, once we come up against the fundamental limits of our understanding, whether there is anything beyond that or not is no longer a subject for objective discussion. I don't make any pretense that atheism is better grounded than theism, as a matter of metaphysics -- because I think that objectively, all metaphysics are in the same boat. We make the leap of faith or we don't, based largely on subjective motivations.\n \n That said, I choose not to. I believe that God does not exist. Atheism.\n \n \nI understand; I'm not sure the archbishop was out to convince anyone so much as simply replying to Dawkins.\n\n \n True enough.\n \n Great discussion!",

They don't feel like they have to take their holy books as textbooks or encyclopedias. (Plus, they keep their religion to themselves and aren't out trying to recruit people. It's like Archie Bunker once said, \"That's the one good thing about the Jews, they don't want you.\") \n \n I do think that all of it is a bunch of fiction, and 'cop-out' or not, I really think it would be better for everybody if we didn't have a bunch of science deniers and literalist fundies running around... and especially running for public office positions like president, school board, or dog catcher. I guess my biggest problem with literalism is that it just seems to neuter the desire for knowledge.",

   "No Offense to you or Matthew, but Theistic Evolution is a cop out. Many Churches and religious people have called themselves this so they can \" Have their Cake and eat it to\" so to speak. Creationists realized the futility of teaching that the invisible man created all and with the advancement of science they realized that their religious belief was taking a serious blow decided to include evolution within their creation to slow down the truth about evolution. Theistic Evolutionists Still Believe that GOD is the creator, and there still is NO scientific evidence to support this, so they basically now say \" Oh, well God created evolution too ... A Cop out. \n \n You can make up as many names as you like but the fact is you either believe in creation or you believe in evolution. There is no science to support a middle ground, it's all just as imaginary as creation.\n\n \n Theistic evolutionists (such as those in my family; I am an atheist myself) believe that God is the creator of everything that exists. They regard the Bible as an allegorical expression of that. Meanwhile, they also regard natural science as fully capable of explaining natural phenomena, through observable material mechanisms.\n \n So what they adopt is a dual perspective: natural phenomena are BOTH the products of those natural mechanisms, AND ALSO the products of divine intention. There is no inconsistency here. The one is science, and appropriately belongs in a science classroom. The other is a matter of faith, and does not.\n \n Meanwhile, theistic evolutionists would be perfectly willing to accept that \"there is no scientific evidence to support a middle ground,\" insofar as they don't consider theism a scientific proposition in the first place, and their reconciliation is also a matter of philosophy rather than science.",

Many Jews and Catholics, and theists more generally, have accepted evolution well before the last 20 or 30 years. That would include a number of extremely important evolutionary biologists, including R.A. Fisher (Anglican) and Theodosius Dobzhansky (Eastern Orthodox): two gentlemen whose work helped produce the so-called \"Modern Synthesis\" of evolutionary biology with genetics. They are but two, and the list is long and continuing.\n \n Biologists Ken Miller and Francis Collins have both written excellent books on the evolution and religion.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I agree. It's just that all that seems to me is, a theistic cast on what evolution is. It doesn't reject any part of what evolution says in terms of natural science. It merely makes the non-scientific claim that this natural process is a tool of God's creation. There's no inconsistency there at all.\n \n \nThat's why I call it a Cop out. They want so badly to be included into the science of the world because that is the only thing that will give them legitimacy in this day and age, and to get that they will sell out their previous beliefs and claim a duel belief....\n\n \n But how are they selling out in any way? It is folly to reject science, that is true. But many theists accept natural science, not because they desire acceptance and legitimation, but because they honestly believe it provides the correct understanding of the natural world. Whether there is anything else beyond the natural world is not a question natural science addresses, and believing on faith that there is some such thing does not require one to hold natural science deficient in any way.\n \n Even far before \"this day and age,\" many theologians already recognized that not everything in the Bible could be taken literally -- including no less an important figure than St. Augustine, who argued in the 4th and 5th centuries that Genesis should be interpreted as an allegory, not a fact.\n \n History provides a picture of the relations between scientific and religious thought very different from what you are claiming.",

Like any evolutionist, theistic evolutionists recognize the difference between science and religion. To claim that the theistic evolutionary position is just a back door to slipping God into biology classes ignores what many a theistic evolutionist teacher has argued, as in the Dover case, for example. Science and religion are separate, but compatible. In a science class, the science should be addressed, but not the religion.

But my reasons for rejecting theism are theological, having to do largely with the Problem of Evil, the coherence of the whole notion of \"God,\" and whether or not there is any way to answer the metaphysical question of what might or might not exist beyond nature. But these are not scientific issues.\n \n Still, if there are people who accept the existence of a creator beyond the realm of nature, who nonetheless also accept that he employs natural processes such as evolution in his creative work, I don't see that as a problem.

This is a view that many theists -- including the Archbishop, for example -- hold on theological grounds: it would be a very strange view of the infinite power, perfect rationality, and perfect foresight of God to say that he has to constantly upset the laws he himself created in order to get things to turn out the way he wants!\n \n \nThe thing is a Theistic Evolutionist won't say that Evolution stands on it's own, to them it still has to have GOD in the mix or it then becomes not so real .\n\n \n No, what theistic evolutionist DO in fact say, is that evolution DOES stand on its own, as a natural explanation for natural phenomena.

   "Seems I'm not alone in my assumptions...\n \n Heres an exert from the Book.. God and Evolution\n \n Can you be an orthodox Darwinist and an orthodox theist? The plain answer is &#8220;no,&#8221; according to God and Evolution, an important new book from Discovery Institute Press. The book provides a thorough examination of the conflict between belief in God and Darwin&#8217;s theory of unguided evolution.\n \n In the century and a half since Charles Darwin first proposed his theory, Christians, Jews, and other religious believers have grappled with how to make sense of it. Most have understood that Darwin&#8217;s theory and materialistic theories of the origin of life have profound theological implications, but their responses have varied dramatically.\n \n Some have rejected evolutionary ideas outright; others, often called &#8220;theistic evolutionists,&#8221; have sought to reconcile materialist theories including Darwinism with their religious beliefs, but often at the cost of clarity, orthodoxy, or both.\n \n &#8220;Too few people have carefully teased out the various scientific, philosophical, and theological claims at stake,&#8221; says Jay Richards, director of research for discovery Institute&#8217;s Center for Science & Culture, and editor of God and Evolution. &#8220;As a result, the whole subject of God and evolution has been an enigma wrapped in a shroud of fuzz and surrounded by a blanket of fog.&#8221;\n \n And here's a three part Article I found that is a pretty good read.\n \n Evolution News & Views: God and Evolution: A Response to Stephen Barr (part 1)\n \n Evolution News & Views: God and Evolution: A Response to Stephen Barr (part 2)\n \n Evolution News & Views: God and Evolution: A Response to Stephen Barr (part 3)\n\n \n So what???

He then breaths life into this CREATION and there you have it. There is NO evolution involved.. he went from nothing to full grown man with the wave of his hand.\n\n \n This is so, if and only if one accepts a literalistic view of Genesis. And that view is exactly what theistic evolutionists deny. To them, Genesis is a matter of allegory, not literal history.\n \n And of course, theologians haven't thought that God has a body since before the Middle Ages. Even the ancient Jewish priests didn't. After all, this is a transcendent deity we're talking about, utterly beyond the world: as such, \"he\" has no body. Anything that implies so is metaphor.\n \n \nNow take Evolution...\n \n These two Processes are so far distant from one another In my View they can't be put in the same category.\n\n \n Indeed, they are not in the same category. The first couldn't even really be called a \"process,\" just a narrative. And narratives are very different from explanations.\n \n I agree with you whole-heartedly that Biblical literalism and evolution are not compatible. But not all Christians are Biblical literalists.\n \n \nNow a Theistic Evolution example might be...\n \n A supernatural being creates a single Cell and then creates this process of evolution to allow his creation to grow and adapt until humans are formed. All the while the world around is mutating and changing and Evolving... But wait.. this is a SUPERNATURAL BEING.. why if he could Create Life with the wave of his hand would he even consider Evolution in the first place?...\n\n \n As I already pointed out in an earlier post, theistic evolutionists don't have to say that God created a single cell via the hand-waving magic, anymore than they have to say that all of life was created that way.\n \n And as to why he would use evolution, that's a very good question. But we should note that it cuts both ways. One could just as easily pose your question the other way around, and ask it of creationists: Why would he do a little magic, when he could use evolution? BOTH alternatives are within the scope of an omnipotent being's power! The mere fact of his omnipotence doesn't mean that he must choose one or the other. So we'd still have to figure out which one he did use. And many Christians have concluded that he used evolution, because the evidence for evolution is all around us.\n \n Then the believer simply needs to address the issue of why evolution, rather than something else (like magic). Theologians have been wrestling with questions of why God does what he does for centuries. It's not a problem that goes away if one adopts a non-literal interpretation of the Bible. But it's also not something that, in the eyes of believers, is rendered impossible by such an interpretation, either.\n \n And there are lots of possibilities. One that theistic evolutionists often appeal to has to do with the concept of a natural world in the first place. God didn't have to create a natural world. He could've included all sorts of supernatural forces within it, acting willy nilly. We could've lived in a world like those portrayed in myths or fantasy novels. But we don't. He chose to create a world that is natural, and governed according to certain law-like regularities. For many theists, this is precisely why he would use something like evolution, that works according to mechanism and law, rather than just poof up this, then that, and more, and so on. It's an explicable plan, appropriate to a deity of infinite foresight and rationality, not just a series of whims.\n \n There are other options besides. And as I'm not a believer myself, I'm hardly the one to argue for them in any detail. My point is simply, asking why God would use evolution rather than just poof things into being, can't qualify as a criticism. It's merely a question that theistic evolutionists need to ask -- and in fact, many do. \n \n \nSee my point.. It's a Cop out. It's like the old saying \" Having your cake and eating it too\"... I personally don't see how they can be cohesive when The Base belief is that a Creator is involved.\n\n \n But saying \"I personally don't see\" is nothing more than an argument from personal incredulity. Such are rightly criticized by evolutionists, when creationists \"don't see\" how evolution could work, and it's rightly criticized here.\n \n The way that theistic evolutionists conceive of the Creator is very different than the way that \"creationists,\" in the Biblical literalist sense, conceive of him. The literalists' version of God is one who subverts the laws of nature through magic. But many theistic evolutionists say that's a pretty strange view of God, always needing to get around the laws that he himself created, despite his perfect foresight. They conceive of God as working within the natural world not by working against nature, but by working through it.\n \n Nothing about this is a \"cop-out.\" Cop-outs make things easier. If anything, I'd say that the theistic evolutionist is making things harder for himself, because his position involves the reconciliation of two perspectives.\n \n \nBut this is my opinion, I'm not claiming I'm right just this is the way I see it.\n\n \n Well, of course, it's your opinion! As my comments are mine. But let's not play the relativist game: we are making claims about what the nature of science and religion is, and those claims might be true, or they might be false. I sincerely doubt that you'd be making your claims if you thought them false!...\n \n I think your view is false, of course, and my own true. It's why I criticize. But don't take it personally.

   "Hey there. Made a video response and observation of my take on Richard Dawkins and a couple other documentary's I watched. I think I did about six hours worth of watching!\n \n Just got hooked on everything and I'm gunning for more. I know a few of you here asked for more videos so here's the link to my newest. Enjoy.\n \n \n YouTube - Journey: Update of My Experiences As An Atheist\n\n I had some comments.\n \n At the beginning of the video you mentioned that speaking of darwin, religious people would attack his character and one never heard about his life as a human being and his journey towards publishing his theory. (paraphrasing)\n \n This is probably already known to you but his character is irrelevant to evolution.\n \n at 12:13 'I think that's when it turns into a negative', I would go so far as to say that when truth is sacrificed to any greater perceived good (comfort, healing, self-worth) is when it turns into an evil.\n \n If you think any of the following doesn't apply to you... it doesn't.\n \n De-conversion and conversion of psychologically traumatic events for a person, the term is most often applied to moving into and out of religious beliefs but that is only a specific case of a general activity.\n \n Conversion and de-conversion occur whenever someone changes their philosophical beliefs.\n \n Changing ones philosophical beliefs does not happen often, the vast majority of times when you change your mind on something takes the form of reconciling that thing with your philosophical beliefs either by a new way of thinking about it or new evidence.\n \n Conversion and de-conversion times are dangerous in the strictest sense (even if they are a positive) because a human being needs philosophy and is mentally incapable of living without it, while in need of a philosophy one may sacrifice beliefs or create new ones at a break neck pace to accelerate the conversion.\n \n The danger lies in the fact that unless the most crucial part of any philosophy (epistemology) is established one may not properly evaluate if ideas should be discarded or created.\n \n Often during these internal revolutions one accepts and rejects a great deal, this has often worked to the extreme benefit of religions.\n \n Ex. a person is unable to deal with the grief of a loved one dying or finds the world too cruel to live in, their mind latches onto a single thread in the fabric of many religions which is an absolute justice, and afterlife. Their need for that belief is so great that they accept anything about the religion to pay for that one belief.\n \n If the religion was catholicism for instance they would accept that god spends some of his time as a compound of cultured cereal grains.\n \n The reverse also happens sometimes, when someone is leaving a religion they may accept things that have the philosophy they are targeting say merely because they assume it must be part of the new philosophy.\n \n I am a subject of de-conversion and I suppose I am very lucky about what triggered the deconversion.\n \n Which was the book atlas shrugged.\n \n Now objectivism has many elements, but the one that destroyed religion in my mind was simply the supremacy of reason.\n \n All those who indoctrinated me into Christianity were careful not to ever present the alternative between faith and reason then demanding that I choose faith.\n \n I have a hard time thinking of a good reason to de-convert besides choosing reason.\n \n The special luck in my case was the 'throwing the ball into my court' instead of handing me a new ball.\n \n The lens of reason was not a convenient way to view the world. It did not fit into any prevalent existing political philosophy.\n \n I found most of what religion 'is' is either wrong, ridiculous, or right for the wrong reasons.\n \n One thing that was abundantly clear though is that if religion is 'right' and religion is wrong, the opposite of religion (the left) was certainly not right.\n \n It seemed to me obvious that the parties as we see them in America are merely the representation of political alliances that have formed for the sake of popular support by association.\n \n The right in America is generally religious, generally capitalistic, generally traditional, and generally pro-individual rights. (although they will sacrifice any one of these values for another depending on the political climate).\n \n The left in America is generally atheistic, generally altruistic, generally socialist, and generally pro-society rights. (although they will sacrifice any one of these values for another depending on the political climate).\n \n There is no 'right' side when both sides hold contradictory values and both sides are willing to contradict values for the sake of winning this 'political war'.\n \n Evolution is a skirmish in this war, it is seen by those on the left as some kind of weapon that can be used to defeat religion; a view mostly propagated by religious who always saw it as the pinnacle of the threat rational investigation posed to mysticism.\n \n Take a walk with me, we are leaving this political thunderstorm; we are now standing on a bright open field. Let's ask the question that really matters.\n \n Not 'what party are you', or 'what label are you'; that is a history of tribal thinking that we must escape, the group that must define your beliefs has a single member.\n \n What do you believe?\n \n I would say reason is the basis of all knowledge, all propositions must be evaluated based on their merit (evidence and logic of supporting argument).\n \n Reason is an axiom, all those who would attempt to defeat it would either try an argument and thereby accept the premise of reason or would simply ignore it.\n \n Now remember that because we have to go back into the storm, the storm will try to force you to pick sides, you must realize that this storm is an artificial construct every topic is it's own topic, the only lines to be drawn is the line between the irrational and the rational.\n \n Man is not born with two humors 'republican' and 'democrat', he is born with reason and the mental freedom to use it or ignore it.\n \n Whenever anyone or any group proposes something is true the arguments that support it must be evaluated, one CANNOT use the fact that you agree with them or they have already said things that are true to support this new proposition.\n \n Such was the case with me and evolution. I can honestly say that there was no pre-existing philosophical reason I shouldn't believe in evolution after I rejected religion. It is in fact very convenient to believe in evolution for a newly formed atheist (atheist meaning against religion).\n \n I could not though.\n \n I thought there was something wrong with it, I always thought there was something wrong with it even when I 'believed it'.\n \n The sad truth is that I when I believed it I wasn't in the habit of questioning what I was told.\n \n If you had asked me then I could not have given a very good argument for why, I could describe to you the problem I saw with it but it would be too fuzzy to really sound convincing.\n \n In my 'revolution' I attempted to sort it out and defend evolution from my own doubts which of course centered around the core of the theory which is pattern building by locking pertinent elements. I thought I succeeded but the 'fuzziness' of the whole thing had confused my efforts. I was able to establish a element locking for novelty on a universal premise that later proved to be untenable in crucial situations.\n \n The reason it was fuzzy ironically is because none of the concepts I would be referencing have been given names in biology. The haze was a result of a lack identification by those who define evolution; the haze was present in the theory.\n \n Then a couple years later I read darwins black box.\n \n That book blew away the haze by coining terms for the ones that did not exist. The vision of a kaleidoscope of changing genes and incomprehensible twists of random assertions were reduced to specific entities delimited by logical parameters such as function and selection pressure.\n \n Whether or not the terms coined in that book are the perfect ones is another matter but the one called IC was exactly what I was thinking off, an IC system is the definition of biological novelty; it was makes life... life as opposed to other examples of mass order or mass complexity in the universe. Simply by isolating the class of pattern evolution is purported (by implication) to create Behe allowed me to perform the analysis I had done earlier with exacting thoroughness. It was the first time I was thinking about this while reading is book that my defense was invalid.\n \n I am proud of what I did next, I dropped evolution because I committed myself to reason; I would not and will not exchange one faith for another.\n \n As with many things hindsight was 20/20 and it was immediately clear that I was had taken the wrong steps, first something must be proven; I accepted something than changed my minds when a sound argument was presented against it.\n \n It is now clear to me that evolution has not been proven, and in fact no one has tried.\n \n I now have to argue with fools who invariably attack a ghostly theocrat version of myself, who want to drag me back to the hazy version of evolution by insisting I not analyze it. ('you try to put rules on biology'). They claim to be champions of science but maintain informal and formal logic fallacies just as vehemently as any fundamentalist christian jesus camp graduate trying to stand up to the godless atheists devil worshippers and for the same reasons, they need something to be true, not want or hope or know NEED.\n \n No one needs to believe anything except what reason herself hands to us; do not believe in evolution because you don't believe in genesis please.",

   "i didnt ask for evidence to support your religion, if i ever do, i already know the answer. i said that puting your belief in something to which you dont know whether it exists or not is unreasonable.\n\n \n But there is 'unreasonable' in the sense of relevance and there is 'unreasonable' in the sense of it not really mattering. I think part of the problem atheists have is that they put WAAAY too much stock in this. The only people I see running around purporting this issue as being critical are anti-theists, because no one else (including non-assertive atheists) seem to be too concerned about it. It's fine if you want to not believe in God, and it's fine if you want to keep insisting that such belief is irrational. (Your loss, but hey, whatever.) But don't do asinine things like make belief-in-evolution a litmus test for sanity, as is Bill Mayer's approach. Believe me, things like that do nothing to help your argument.\n \n \nthat isnt a scientific statement at all either, it doenst deal with science at all. it is unreasonable because if you believe in something which has no support to whether it exists or not\n\n \n And again, to that I say 'so what?'\n \n \nin order to avoid hypocrisy, you would NEED to believe in absolutely everything humanly imaginable, especially if there is no evidence. i could say that i believe in a magic talking invisible monkey, and that would abide by exactly the same principles as believing in God.\n\n \n Except magic talking invisible monkeys don't have lots of writings attesting to their existence and influence on history as well as an historic movement that is not likely to have come about if it were just all a big hoax, and evidence of effect of said being (teleological). Again, you're erroneously acting as if there is no evidence for theism; there most certainly IS. There is far MORE evidence for the theism that we believe in than there is for your silly example. If all speculation outside our immediate sphere of experience were equal (as you seem to think) to where fairy-tales carry the same weight as anything else held seriously in the world, then indeed there WOULD be magic-talking-invisible-monkey religions and anything else out there. The fact there are NOT churches of the flying-spaghetti-monster religion everywhere indicates there is and was more evidence for one set of theism than fairy-tales.\n \n \nnow, that doesnt make any difference and no one would care, unless i got a million followers to follow this magic talking monkey, \n\n \n But that's not what happened, now is it? There is no religion of the magic monkey, or whatever. I could take any thing the WORLD agrees doesn't exist and compare it to something much of the world agrees DOES exist too, just as you have done there, but it wouldn't make the comparison any more valid. The comparison you are making is based on an erroneous presupposition that both examples carry the same weight of evidence. They do not, as I showed above.\n \n Furthermore, the issue of numbers--that millions may follow a given tenet--is only relevant if those millions are out doing bad things as a result. Again, theism isn't some green-eyed monster ready to steal candy from babies. It's just part of the human experience. It isn't going to go away.\n \n \nand then the monkey started telling people to go bomb elementary schools.\n\n \n So work to make sure those theists DON'T do that. But don't discourage them from being theist. Your approach is like insisting people not have sex at all just because some people get STDs. The better approach is to be tolerant of people being theist, but addressing the issue of' bombing elementary schools' without condemning theism altogether. Just as with the issue of STDs we don't condemn sex altogether, but rather address the individual problem by educating people to use protection.\n \n \ni am also not asking to have religion banned.\n\n \n It makes no difference--even DISCOURAGING theism based on the actions a few is irrational. Even if you aren't trying to ban it, the very fact you look at it in such a blanket generalized way demonstrates prejudice on your part, because you likely wouldn't take that approach with other things. (Like the STD/sex issue I mentioned.) It's an absolute hypocritical canard to pretend to be rational and stand for reason when you use the example of a few extremists in a movement to indicate the whole movement is bad. \n \n \nCAUSE??? religion DOES cause the majority of terrorism. association AND cause.\n\n \n Prove it. The only evidence you have for that assertion is .... (drum roll) association. :)\n \n \nback to evidence, im afraid you have misunderstood the meaning of the word \"evidence\", and those who you speak of, who weigh out the evidence for religious belief have done exactly the same. if there is evidence for religious belief, someone can be shown the evidence.\n\n \n How about if skeptics continually move the goal posts to where whatever is brought forth as evidence will never suffice? This issue of theism is the ONLY issue where ancient WRITTEN reports are automatically discounted just because they involve religion. It's funny--if we were to take the same approach with anything else, we'd have to throw out almost everything we know about the ancient world. All the records of Egyptian pharoahs? Have to throw 'em out. Because the records involve religious elements, and pharoahs were considered Gods. So to your point, I would say evidence certainly HAS been shown. You all have just determined you will reject it out of hand.",

   " When we're talking about a space for the miraculous opening up in the intrinsic uncertainties of quantum mechanics (a la Miller), we're talking about something that is literally impossible to understand: something beyond the fundamental limits of our understanding (a la Williams) working its way into the world. What I'm thinking about is, I guess, something like the possibility that yes, things like electron positions end up being probabilistic from the point of view of nature, but there's a divine intention guiding every such seemingly random event. Such an intention is undetectable via natural science and human understanding, but there it is. It might be a little presumptuous for me to call that \"far-fetched\" -- but I'd certainly say it involves a leap of logic!\n\n \n Yes, and therefore it falls under the realm of the 'undetectable.' Is it fair to criticize someone for not presenting evidence when their subject matter is not of the evidentiary, to begin with? I would say no. \n I don't know if I agree that things like quantum mechanics fall under the category of being \"literally impossible to understand\"--I don't know enough about it. But as hypothetical as it apparently is, I see no reason to say it's any more likely than purporting the divine.\n \n I still say, it seems like a lot of what skeptics are about here is terminology. Take away the term \"God\" or \"Divine\" and instead call it \"advanced-evolved-being-far-beyond-our-capabilities\" and suddenly they are a lot more open to it. And so what if the 'Divine' really IS just a more advanced being? As A.C< Clarke said, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" But does that really matter?

Can you Show Any evidence outside of the Bible that any of it is real?.. Before the Bible was assembled by men There is NO Historical Evidence of God's existance. There are Historical Documents concerning other Gods, But of course the Religions of today completely ignore that fact. So Show me A Historical Document concerning the Resurrection that was written Before the Gospels.. You can't.

It may not happen in our life time but one day in the future on human kind people will open their eyes to the truth and religion will fall. There are Countless religions that have disappeared because people gave up believing. \n \n I like the symbolic message from the Movie Clash of the Titans. God only gains his Power through the people believing. When they stop believing he dies. It will happen again, just like Gods like Zeus, Mithra, Horus, Apollo , and countless others in our Past when it's proven that This \"GOD\" cannot deliver the people will stop believing and religion will die.

Keep that nonsense in churches and religious studies classes ; keep it out of science classrooms, out of government, and it would be fine. \n\n \n I fully believe you on your take about the not-wanting-it-touted-as-fact-part, I just don't believe you are tolerant of it otherwise. In my experience, anti-theists purport the whole 'keeping-it-out-of-schools' thing, when they really just don't like religion period. It's just a lot easier to defend the keeping-it-out-of-govt. thing so they generally try to only talk about that part.

Anyway, what I meant was that they are purporting to be atheist. It is simply another way of saying that's how they describe themselves.\n \n \nNo, but there is plenty of writings on witches, witchcraft, and magic; demons haunting people and impregnating women (the offspring were of course witches).\n\n \n And in fact there are many who DO believe there are paranormal forces out there beyond what we can see and hear, and these are part of the reason they believe that.

I'm not offended when you tell me you are a Christian. I'll say it like this, maybe you can understand WHY is despise religion... you've probably heard this story before so bare with me....\n \n On September 11 2001 19 Radical Muslims from Saudi Arabia hijacked 4 airliners and flew them into buildings in America ... 2 hit the World trade center buildings, bringing them to the ground, 1 hit the pentagon destroying a section of the building and killing over 170 people. the 4th was taken over by passengers and crashed in Pennsylvania. Over 3500 Americans were killed as well as people from other nations. Now these 19 Men did this act of Vile Evil because \" GOD\" told them to kill the infidels. \n \n Remember this story?.. I'm sure you do. However, You can deny it until your blue but one fact remains . This is the SAME GOD that Christians follow blindly through life. You can say it's not the same God, but Christians, Catholics, Jews, Mormons, Muslims, and countless other religions around the world ALL follow the same GOD. Now each one has their own belief and GOD has told each religion differently on many subjects. But it's still the Same GOD. What is sad is that People teach their Children To believe the same way, and down through the generations it goes. Now we are left with a mixed message from a GOD that clearly only exists in la la land. \n \n Now \" GOD' Told those 19 men to fly those planes into the towers, they killed a few thousand people and their blood lust was satisfied for a few months. But the \" GOD\" turns around and tells George W. to Go to war with Afghanistan, then he sends old George on another Mission to Iraq to take down the evil tyrant. \n \n The point is.. It doesn't matter whether God is Real or not.. Just the Fact that People THINK he is, and that he actually TALKS to people and Guides their decisions is the Danger I speak of. If an Imaginary GOD can get 19 men to commit such an atrocity and get another man to Start 2 wars.. not to mention the Atrocities which mark our bloody World History.. All the innocent Children who have died because their Parents thought GOD would save them, all the Death and destruction we can lay at the feet of religion.. Well if that's not enough to turn anyone's stomach I don't know what would.\n \n And I'm not saying all religious people are bad, or that all religious people are capable of such things. I know religious people who are truly just good people. But I think now you can at least see why someone like myself would despise the very existance of religion.",

Evidence for things like ghosts and demons and alien abductions are almost always from personal experience at night when a person is sleepy and susceptible to vivid, lifelike dreams and hallucinations. Then when people hear similar experiences as theirs, it reinforces their beliefs. But no empirical evidence is ever available; nothing that can't be easily faked or that has a simpler explanation can ever be found.\n \n In Sagan's book, he uses a simplified example of a dragon in a man's basement. When a scientist goes to see it, he is told that it is invisible. When they test for footprints, the explanation is that the dragon floats. When they test for the invisible fire the dragon breathes, the explanation is that it is heatless fire. When they want to paint the dragon's skin to be able to see it, it is said that the dragon is incorporeal. \n \n Sagan asks what the difference is between this invisible dragon and no dragon at all. Things like ghosts and demons and angels and aliens are always shaped by the popular views at the time. \n \n The reason these people believe is often because they just want to believe it. It would be pretty cool to live in a world with ghosts and magic, but there's no real reason to believe it. People take personal experiences at face value and they don't approach claims skeptically. \n \n Also, I know some people probably have made the claim that there is evidence to disprove god(s), but there really is no such evidence. It is an impossible thing to disprove. The only thing that can be 'disproved' is showing that holy books aren't accurate or that certain beliefs are inconsistent with reality.",

Sometimes it's just creaky floors and so forth, but then there are visions, voices, etc. It get's muddier at that point\n\n \n \n Voices, visions, and hallucinations are all well covered in that book, and those things are all very common. \n \n People are pattern seekers. Just like how on TV you have 'ghost hunters' who go through tons of static they record until they find something that sounds like words. When its really dark outside, maybe you think you see somebody, like when you see things in the clouds or in smoke.\n \n How many times have you thought you heard a doorbell ring or a phone ring when there was nothing? Have you ever thought somebody said something to you when they didn't say a word? Not many people would even consider those things to be hallucinations since they are so common, but similar instances alone prove my point that your senses aren't always trustworthy. \n \n Hearing more complex sounds and voices (other than just a few words) and seeing people that aren't there are also common. There are a lot of very normal things that can trigger hallucinations... stress, sleep or food deprivation, headaches, fevers, and obviously drugs and alcohol. \n \n I think a lot of the experiences can be chalked up to dreams, though. Think of how many of these experiences are described as happening when a person is about to go to bed, or after they got out of bed at night, or when they were frozen in bed and couldn't move after just waking up (sleep paralysis... which I have experienced). \n \n I've been a very vivid (and lucid) dreamer for some time, and I know firsthand how realistic dreams can be. \n \n I remember once when I was younger, I dreamed that I had gotten out of bed one morning and my parents told me that we were going to some restaurant. I went back to bed and fell back asleep. I woke up (for real this time) and went and told my mom that I didn't feel like going out to eat. She looked at me like I was crazy and told me she wasn't planning to. I then realized it had been a dream. That type of dream is an extremely common phenomena known as a false awakening. I've had hundreds of them. \n \n Time and time again it has been shown that we can't always trust our sight, our hearing, and especially not our mind's ability to tell the difference between reality and dreams (not without conscious effort). \n \n \nI could agree with that except I've seen too much, to where I know there are some things like that out there. I've seen them first hand in third world countries I've traveled to. I've witnessed an exorcism that simply could not have been faked. I've also seen healings that could not have been hoaxes.\n\n \n I don't understand how you could assert with such certainty that something couldn't be faked. I know guys like Benny Hinn have been shown to be frauds and there's never been any medical evidence of a true miracle healing.\n \n What I find interesting about exorcisms is that although they are supposedly done in the name of God, they happen in many different denominations of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and I'm sure other religions. \n \n I've always figured that exorcisms were performed on people had real psychological disorders. The wiki article on exorcism said this:\n \n \nDemonic possession is not a valid psychiatric or medical diagnosis recognized by either the DSM-IV or the ICD-10. Those who profess a belief in demonic possession have sometimes ascribed the symptoms associated with mental illnesses such as hysteria, mania, psychosis, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy, schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder to possession.[17][18][19] In cases of dissociative identity disorder in which the alter personality is questioned as to its identity, 29% are reported to identify themselves as demons.[20] Additionally, there is a form of monomania called demonomania or demonopathy in which the patient believes that he or she is possessed by one or more demons.\n \n The illusion that exorcism works on people experiencing symptoms of possession is attributed by some to placebo effect and the power of suggestion.[21] Some supposedly possessed persons are actually narcissists or are suffering from low self-esteem and act like a \"demon possessed person\" in order to gain attention.[17]\n\n \n The part I bolded also explains things like the people falling down in unison on the televangelist shows, and is also known to happen easily in hypnosis when people recover false memories due to the hypnotist's subtle and often unintentional suggestions. Sagan also talked about this in The Demon Haunted World (especially in regard to sexual abuse, UFO, and demon related stuff.)

   "It might be good to take this over to start a new thread. But here are my thoughts.\n \n \nExcept magic talking invisible monkeys don't have lots of writings attesting to their existence...\n\n \n Could I ask something about this? While a writing can certainly \"attest\" to the existence of something, it just as certainly isn't evidence. For evidence is needed in order to show that the attestation was accurate, yes?\n \n Since it's relevant, I've moved some later discussion of writing to this point:\n \n \nHow about if skeptics continually move the goal posts to where whatever is brought forth as evidence will never suffice? This issue of theism is the ONLY issue where ancient WRITTEN reports are automatically discounted just because they involve religion.\n\n \n Not so! They're discounted to the extent that what is needed is evidence to corroborate what was written. The writing isn't evidence, in and of itself. Maybe the next point will make it even clearer.\n \n \nIt's funny--if we were to take the same approach with anything else, we'd have to throw out almost everything we know about the ancient world. All the records of Egyptian pharoahs? Have to throw 'em out. Because the records involve religious elements, and pharoahs were considered Gods.\n\n \n But of course, we dothrow them out, in the sense that we don't treat those writings as evidence that the pharaohs were gods! Those writings are fantastic evidence for what the ancient Egyptians believed. But they are not accepted as evidence for the truth of the ancient Egyptians' beliefs.\n \n And it's not just religious texts that receive this sort of skepticism. Greek historians like Herodotus also come in for much criticism. His work is often the only source for certain quotations attributed to this or that politician or philosopher, and for precisely that reason his work is not just accepted at face value. It has become very clear that he didn't make as sharp a distinction as we would like between documentation and hearsay, or between fact and legend.\n \n The upshot: writings don't serve as evidence for what they are writing about. They need evidence in order to confirm that what they are writing about is correct.\n \n Okay, now back to the straightforward order:\n \n \n...and influence on history as well as an historic movement that is not likely to have come about if it were just all a big hoax...\n\n \n But of course, being a hoax is far from the only way an idea could be in error! I have no doubt of the sincerity of most believers, especially most of the founders of Christianity. But just as writings aren't evidence, neither is sincerity.\n \n \n... and evidence of effect of said being (teleological).\n\n \n Okay, what is the evidence for teleology? And for that matter...\n \n \nAgain, you're erroneously acting as if there is no evidence for theism; there most certainly IS. There is far MORE evidence for the theism that we believe in than there is for your silly example.\n\n \n ...what is the evidence for theism? What is the empirical, material, natural evidence that a non-empirical, immaterial, supernatural entity exists? Please keep in mind the above concerns about writings or sincerity as evidence.\n \n Now, I'm not saying that there is any evidence against theism, either. Nor am I even saying that theism is inconsistent with evidence. But I'm very unsure what could, even in principle, serve as evidence for theism. As far as I can see, belief is a matter of faith, not evidence. To wit:\n \n \nIf all speculation outside our immediate sphere of experience were equal (as you seem to think) to where fairy-tales carry the same weight as anything else held seriously in the world, then indeed there WOULD be magic-talking-invisible-monkey religions and anything else out there.\n\n \n But that's not so! When we're talking about what is beyond (I won't say immediate, but) our everyday experiences of the world of nature then it does seem to me that anything goes. It still remains the case that, within the natural world, things are constrained.\n \n -----\n \n Let me sum up:\n \n 1. Writing is not evidence that what has been written about is accurate. It can serve as evidence for beliefs, but not that the beliefs in question are true.\n \n 2. Sincerity is also not evidence that what is believed is true.\n \n 3. What is the evidence for teleology in history?\n \n 4. What is the evidence for theism?",

It's not that quantum mechanics is impossible to understand (though certainly difficult). It's that if there is something supernatural that takes advantage of the intrinsic natural uncertainties described by QM, that supernatural something is what's not understandable.\n \n \nI still say, it seems like a lot of what skeptics are about here is terminology.

   "i will respond to both your reply to me and to Stonewall.\n \n you are continuing to consider evolution as being something very specific, like brazing. it is not - its a general term that encompasses lots of different issues. if you were to compare it to brazing, evolution would be the chemical reaction, common descent would be brazing. common descent is an example of evolution, brazing is an example of a chemical reaction.\n \n see, if one were to prove that brazing was a chemical reaction, the assumption must already be made that chemical reactions occur.\n \n its interesting that Stonewall mentioned atomic theory, and its interesting that you stated that its been proven, because i cannot think of a better example which parallels macroevolution than atomic theory. both have not been directly observed very well due to current technology, both have a substantial amount of evidence to support them, both are commonly used, accepted theories, both can be considered proven theories, macroevolution is intangibly large, AT is intangibly small.\n \n a proof of common descent would be proof of evolution a million times. the general claims of evolution are satisfied and then some when common descent is proven. lets take atomic theory again, Rutherford proved the existence of an area of collection of matter inside of an atom with his gold foil experiment. does this prove atomic theory? a thousand times! the model is already assuming atomic theory is true (at this point were talking about the earlier days of atomic theory), and if the model is proven, the theory of which its based off of is also proven. the model helps to both prove the theory of which its based off of and advance the theory, as is certainly true with both AT and evolution.\n \n lets look at a math question - if f(g(x)) is proven, g(x) must also be true. evolution works the same way. if common descent is proven, evolution must also be true.",

Answers\n Answers.com - Can a scientific theory be proven true\n \n Things such as evolution and atomic theory (which as Bennedict correctly stated, an atom has never been directly observed) fall into the \"closest thing to proof that exist\" category. \n \n Also, it is most definitely NOT irrelevant that contradictory evidence could surface when determining if something has been proven. Einstein and Newton are perfect examples of that. Newton's theory was not completely correct on very large and very small scales. Einstein did NOT simply expand on Newton, and he in fact DID disprove Newton.

   "As it is completly pointless to argue with those who argue on any other premise but objective truth.\n\n \n Spoken like an Objectivist!\n \n \nI as usual demand you support your assertions.\n\n \n Which assertions? About my experiences in arguing with Objectivists?\n \n Because of course it is those experiences that have led to my assessment of the merits of Objectivism, or more accurately the lack thereof. My longest-running experience in debating an Objectivist concerned another internet forum some years ago. In philosophical terms, one of the major issues of our debate was the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. He perpetually criticized Kant for being an enemy of science and reason, and a proponent of faith and religion.\n \n Never you mind that most of Kant's epistemological and metaphysical works are devoted to supporting natural science as a way of gaining a true understanding of the natural world. Never you mind that Kant's famous comment about 'denying knowledge to make room for faith' -- which was the only passage said Objectivist ever quoted, and also one of the few that I've ever found quoted directly by Rand herself -- means denying claims to metaphysical knowledge about the nature of God and the human soul, though allowing belief in them as a matter of faith; and does not mean denying scientific knowledge, which Kant most certainly did not think religious faith could in any way trump; and which is made extremely plain by the context of the quote, which said Objectivist invariably omitted. Never you mind that even Kant's work on religion was undertaken in an allegorical and non-literal sense, the very title of his major work on the topic -- Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone -- displaying the rationalistic bent that actually got him into hot water with religious authorities at times.\n \n No, as far as this Objectivist was concerned, Kant was an enemy of science and reason, a proponent of traditional faith and religion. Certainly, no examination of what Kant actually said or did could persuade him otherwise. Certainly, the fact that no one who understands Kant -- including many of his most effective critics (and I am critical myself about many things in his corpus, I should add) -- would make such claims, directly opposed to reality as they are. No, no: it was in all the Rand books he'd read that Kant was the great enemy of reason (and freedom, despite his defense of it, and capitalism, despite his defense of that), and that was that. Why was I being so unreasonable as not to recognize this? So he just kept repeating the out-of-context quote as if nothing ever happened.\n \n I also once saw leading Objectivist thinker John Ridpath give a lecture back in my undergraduate days. One of the major planks in his argument was his defense of Rand's ethical egoism: the individual is of the highest value, because life exists in individual units; it's not a collective property. I pointed out during the Q&A that this line of argument is a pretty clear example of the naturalistic fallacy: you can't derive the way things ought to be from the way they are. His response was not to show that I had misunderstood his argument (I was just an undergrad, after all) or to show that the naturalistic fallacy is not really fallacious under this or that circumstance. No, his response was to ask me if I would rather base my philosophy on inidividual death -- how nihilistic of me!... The audience, which consisted pretty much entirely of the local \"Students for Objectivism\" chapter -- which I had up to then been dabbling in a bit -- loved it, of course.\n \n Such has been my experience. All in all, it's a perfect lesson in what using terms like \"objective truth\" and \"the supremacy of reason\" is really about, right down to the Objectivist movement's tendency to expel heretics.",

   "you are continuing to consider evolution as being something very specific, like brazing. it is not - its a general term that encompasses lots of different issues. if you were to compare it to brazing, evolution would be the chemical reaction, common descent would be brazing. common descent is an example of evolution, brazing is an example of a chemical reaction.\n\n In my analogy evolution was 'chemical reaction'.\n \n Comment descent is a relational phenomenon, it is neither an instance of change nor a type of change causing explaination.\n \n Calling common descent a type of change is like calling a grid a type of line.\n \n \nsee, if one were to prove that brazing was a chemical reaction, the assumption must already be made that chemical reactions occur.\n\n Certainly.\n \n \nits interesting that Stonewall mentioned atomic theory, and its interesting that you stated that its been proven, because i cannot think of a better example which parallels macroevolution than atomic theory. both have not been directly observed very well due to current technology, both have a substantial amount of evidence to support them, both are commonly used, accepted theories, both can be considered proven theories, macroevolution is intangibly large, AT is intangibly small.\n\n Direct observation is not a requirement for proof.\n \n I have been wondering for a couple posts now, why do you use the terms micro and macro evolution?\n \n \na proof of common descent would be proof of evolution a million times.\n\n That is what I thought you were saying, alright state the argument please.\n \n \nthe general claims of evolution are satisfied and then some when common descent is proven. lets take atomic theory again, Rutherford proved the existence of an area of collection of matter inside of an atom with his gold foil experiment. does this prove atomic theory? a thousand times! the model is already assuming atomic theory is true (at this point were talking about the earlier days of atomic theory), and if the model is proven, the theory of which its based off of is also proven. the model helps to both prove the theory of which its based off of and advance the theory, as is certainly true with both AT and evolution.\n\n In the context of atomic theory he was discovering something new, but no he certainly didn't prove atomic theory with that experiment even if he supported it.\n \n \nif common descent is proven, evolution must also be true.\n\n Second of all, no as I illustrated by identifying it as a formal fallacy predictions being true cannot prove the cause.\n \n The art of crafting a scientific experiment is to setup a if X than theory A is true.\n \n Not a if theory A is true then X will be true.\n \n That is how theories are proven.\n \n \nNo, none of them are absolutely proven or they would be laws. They may as well be, due to all the evidence piled up, but they are not proven. Scientific theories cannot be proven true. \n\n Then how do they turn into laws? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nThings such as evolution and atomic theory (which as Bennedict correctly stated, an atom has never been directly observed) fall into the \"closest thing to proof that exist\" category. \n\n Bennedict has just stated that common descent proves evolution a thousand times, does he mean proof or 'closest thing to proof that exist'?\n \n \nAlso, it is most definitely NOT irrelevant that contradictory evidence could surface when determining if something has been proven.\n\n Well you are right, sorry if I phrased that badly. Contradictory evidence could not surface if something has been proven.\n \n \nEinstein and Newton are perfect examples of that. Newton's theory was not completely correct on very large and very small scales. Einstein did NOT simply expand on Newton, and he in fact DID disprove Newton. And with the whole dark matter problem cosmologists have, nothing is completely certain. \n\n Nothing is completly certain EXCEPT that nothing is completly certain eh?\n \n \nI remember reading a thread on this site some time back discussing things like light, relativity, and quantum mechanics. I don't remember which thread it was or what it was specifically about (things go way off topic on this board at times), but I do remember you (I'm like 96% sure it was you) showing a complete lack of understanding of those topics even though you were willing to argue about them. Because of that it's not surprising to me that you think Newton's gravity is proven.\n\n yah huh\n \n \nObviously you still haven't read it. Bennedict did a good job explaining why your position is hard to understand.\n\n Not to my satisfaction, but since you understand it why don't you give it a shot.\n \n \nSpoken like an Objectivist!\n\n Thank you.\n \n \nWhich assertions? About my experiences in arguing with Objectivists?\n \n Because of course it is those experiences that have led to my assessment of the merits of Objectivism, or more accurately the lack thereof. My longest-running experience in debating an Objectivist concerned another internet forum some years ago. In philosophical terms, one of the major issues of our debate was the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. He perpetually criticized Kant for being an enemy of science and reason, and a proponent of faith and religion.\n \n Never you mind that most of Kant's epistemological and metaphysical works are devoted to supporting natural science as a way of gaining a true understanding of the natural world. Never you mind that Kant's famous comment about 'denying knowledge to make room for faith' -- which was the only passage said Objectivist ever quoted, and also one of the few that I've ever found quoted directly by Rand herself -- means denying claims to metaphysical knowledge about the nature of God and the human soul, though allowing belief in them as a matter of faith; and does not mean denying scientific knowledge, which Kant most certainly did not think religious faith could in any way trump; and which is made extremely plain by the context of the quote, which said Objectivist invariably omitted. Never you mind that even Kant's work on religion was undertaken in an allegorical and non-literal sense, the very title of his major work on the topic -- Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone -- displaying the rationalistic bent that actually got him into hot water with religious authorities at times.\n\n So since you couldn't convince this fellow that kant isn't really such a bad guy arguing with objectivist is pointless?\n \n I haven't convinced you, bennedict, databed, peeling, trebor, accipiter, xcaliber ect. that evolution does not explain life; does that mean arguing with evolutionist is pointless?\n \n \nNo, as far as this Objectivist was concerned, Kant was an enemy of science and reason, a proponent of traditional faith and religion. Certainly, no examination of what Kant actually said or did could persuade him otherwise. Certainly, the fact that no one who understands Kant -- including many of his most effective critics (and I am critical myself about many things in his corpus, I should add) -- would make such claims, directly opposed to reality as they are. No, no: it was in all the Rand books he'd read that Kant was the great enemy of reason (and freedom, despite his defense of it, and capitalism, despite his defense of that), and that was that. Why was I being so unreasonable as not to recognize this? So he just kept repeating the out-of-context quote as if nothing ever happened.\n\n Well as an objectivist I am familiar with many of the accusations Kant receives in objectivist literature and I am quite certain that she blames him for philosophical opposition to reason, not direct verbatim.\n \n She also blames conservatives in America with the same charge, that their words say 'capitalism' but their philosophy (based on Christianity) says 'socialism'.\n \n I am not so familiar with Kant's works but from what you have said he sounds like another philosopher Thomas Aquinas (whom I did read as a last hope for religion) who advocated that reason is a valid means of knowledge but also that faith is necessary because all knowledge is not rational.\n \n You won't find him condemning reason either, but philosophically he is guilty of the same crime merely for advocating faith in epistemology where it cannot co-exist with reason.\n \n \nI also once saw leading Objectivist thinker John Ridpath give a lecture back in my undergraduate days. One of the major planks in his argument was his defense of Rand's ethical egoism: the individual is of the highest value, because life exists in individual units; it's not a collective property. I pointed out during the Q&A that this line of argument is a pretty clear example of the naturalistic fallacy: you can't derive the way things ought to be from the way they are. His response was not to show that I had misunderstood his argument (I was just an undergrad, after all) or to show that the naturalistic fallacy is not really fallacious under this or that circumstance. No, his response was to ask me if I would rather base my philosophy on inidividual death -- how nihilistic of me!... The audience, which consisted pretty much entirely of the local \"Students for Objectivism\" chapter -- which I had up to then been dabbling in a bit -- loved it, of course.\n\n First off I assume you mean 'naturalistic fallacy' as in hume not moore. (because objectivist have been accused of perpetrating both)\n \n The way things are needs no derivation based on a man, but the way things ought to be is a human judgement and depends entirely (for the individual) on how you make that derivation.\n \n If that is all he said I will readily admit he was extremely unclear, but I believe he was saying that you believed the way things ought to be isn't rationally accessible.\n \n Objectivist believe it is accessible if you choose your standard of value correctly, so he asked a question about your choice of values.\n \n \nSuch has been my experience. All in all, it's a perfect lesson in what using terms like \"objective truth\" and \"the supremacy of reason\" is really about, right down to the Objectivist movement's tendency to expel heretics.\n\n They are really about what they are defined to mean. Rejecting a philosophy because some people who hold it couldn't answer a question comprehensively or don't know how to argue is like rejecting science because some scientists have published papers which were later disproved.\n \n \nIt's a strange coincidence, but while I'm harping on the unreasonableness of Objectivism anyway.... The very same Objectivist with whom I years ago had my other extended internet debates also thought that Newton had been proved correct, precession of Mercury's perihelion be damned. To see Freedom now voice the same erroneous assessment of Newton is fascinating to me. \n\n Great minds think alike.

Newton's gravity was wrong in areas where relativity was correct. You seem to get really hung up on semantics and stuff, so whatever. It is what it is. Newton's equations give great approximations and aren't as difficult to work out, but they aren't entirely correct. The fact is that relativity supersedes it.

Theories describe the 'why.' You can't prove the 'why' and that's why theories can't be laws. \n \n I said this:\n \n \nNo, none of them are absolutely proven or they would be laws.\n\n \n I was saying that if a theory was absolutely proven (which I said was not possible) it would be a law. That's not to say that I believe \"all scientific laws are absolute.\" That's explained by the wiki quote from earlier:\n \n \nAs such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and is often found to be false when extrapolated.\n\n \n I've often heard Newtonian gravitation described as theory and law. \n \n Objects attract each other. If you drop something, it's going to fall; objects in space will always either fall into each other, orbit, or slingshot past, etc. That's the law, and it always holds true. \n \n However, when you get into the equations, you often will see it called a theory (as seen in the wiki article for gravity below), which is what it is. \n \n \nNewton's theory of gravitation\n Main article: Newton's law of universal gravitation\n \n In 1687, English mathematician Sir Isaac Newton published Principia, which hypothesizes the inverse-square law of universal gravitation. In his own words, \"I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must [be] reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve: and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly.\"[3]\n \n Newton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of Neptune based on motions of Uranus that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by both John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are what led Johann Gottfried Galle to the discovery of Neptune.\n \n A discrepancy in Mercury's orbit pointed out flaws in Newton's theory. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that its orbit showed slight perturbations that could not be accounted for entirely under Newton's theory, but all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) had been fruitless. The issue was resolved in 1915 by Albert Einstein's new theory of general relativity, which accounted for the small discrepancy in Mercury's orbit.\n \n Although Newton's theory has been superseded, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations are still made using Newton's theory because it is a much simpler theory to work with than general relativity, and gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving sufficiently small masses, speeds and energies. \n\n \n Gravitation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n It's basically the same thing with the 3 laws of motion. All of the classical mechanics of Newton have been superseded by relativity/quantum mechanics, and unless we ever discover a theory of everything none of the theories will always hold true for every situation. \n \n We're so far off the original point, though, which was that this quote of yours,\n \n \nNo that is not how all science works, some theories are proven, in mathematics and physics all theories of proven or they are thrown out.\n\n \n is completely wrong. Theories aren't proven or thrown out, they are kept until disproved. It was your claim that all these theories/laws were proven (Newton's gravitation/motion, germ, atomic, relativity, etc), and that evolution had not been. This whole conversation about Newton has been a red herring.",

   "According to the United States National Academy of Sciences,\n \n Some scientific explanations are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them. The explanation becomes a scientific theory. In everyday language a theory means a hunch or speculation. Not so in science. In science, the word theory refers to a comprehensive explanation of an important feature of nature supported by facts gathered over time. Theories also allow scientists to make predictions about as yet unobserved phenomena,[7]\n \n According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science,\n \n A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not \"guesses\" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than \"just a theory.\" It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.[8]\n \n The primary advantage enjoyed by this definition is that it firmly marks things termed theories as being well supported by evidence. This would be a disadvantage in interpreting real discourse between scientists who often use the word theory to describe untested but intricate hypotheses in addition to repeatedly confirmed models. However, in an educational or mass media setting it is almost certain that everything of the form X theory is an extremely well supported and well tested theory. This causes the theory/non-theory distinction to much more closely follow the distinctions useful for consumers of science (e.g. should I believe something or not?)\n \n \n Theory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Scientific Laws and Theories\n \n References\n \n * Popper, Karl (1963), Conjectures and Refutations, Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, UK, pp. 33-39.
