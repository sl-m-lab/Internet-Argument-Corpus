   "Creationists are always bringing up the idea that people Use evolution to justify Eugenics. They talk about various depraved individuals that wanted to kill to keep the \"blood pure\" and use Evolution is a justification. The problem with this argument is that Evolution is not really the justification it just was the common buzz word asociated with genetics and aquired characteristics. \n The nazis were wrong to claim that jews were inferior but once you start from the incorrect premise then saying jews should not breed with aryans does not really rely on evolution it just relies on the fact that children are like their parents.",

   "Evolution, or more specifically Social Darwinism was used to support all sorts of repellent ideologies (i.e. Eugenics) in the last few decades of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th. \n \n There is nothing unique here, as history is (tragically) full of examples of noble causes or articles of faith being subverted to the end of justifying the subjuation, discrimation or maltreatment of specific groups of people.\n \n Unfortunately for Young Earth Creationists, the juxtaposition of objective evolutionary science against the atrocities of the Nazi's is a weak and opportunistic position at best.\n \n The Nazi's used just about every area of intellectual endeavour in the pursuit of their goals, so if we tar and feather evolution in this way, we also have to do the same with Chemistry, Engineering, Cinema, Radio, Religion and so on as well- a ridiculous position if ever there was.\n \n Plus I'd wager some of our YEC's touting these arguements are more than a little at risk of hypocrisy- I'd like to hear how many of them drive a Ford..... after all, Henry Ford was a known admirer of and contributor to the NSDAP, and never returned or relinquished The Grand Cross of the Order of the German Eagle he was awarded by Hitler in 1938. But you'd be silly to let the fact that Ford held such views cloud your judgement of their cars today......... wouldn't you?",
