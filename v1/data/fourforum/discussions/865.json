   "Hypothetical question:\n \n Let's say at the moment you were conceived, a different sperm happened to fertilize the egg instead.\n \n The person that was born -- would that still be you? Would it be your consciousness (or soul) with a biologically different body and mind? Would the thought processes stay the same even though the mind is physically different?\n \n Basically, if the variables were changed, do you think you'd never have been born? Or do you think you would've still been born but in a different body?\n \n Whatever it is that makes you YOU (consciousness or soul or mind or whatever you want to call it), does it depend on mere birth order, or does it have to be the exact combination of sperm and egg? Could your consciousness/soul been born to different parents?",

   "A tough question that probably has thousands of different possibilities.\n \n My belief is 'you' is nothing more than electrical impulses anyways and you are only convinced you exist because the impulses allow you to believe this. A human 'You' is simply the controller of a single brain program.\n \n Would the same controller exist if a different sperm or egg created the life you became? My guess would be no. It's all in how the circuitry of the mind is laid and it would have been laid differently.\n \n What are the odds that the conscious 'you' was ever even created? I'll bet the odds are about zero. Simple random chance. So even if God doesn't exist, it is still a miracle that your consciousness exists today.\n \n Another question to be posed is does an animal have a 'you' type (un)consciousness inside of them? Does 'you' even have to be conscious to exist? Does the 'you' need to believe it exists for it to exist? Since I believe 'you' is just a program, I don't think consciousness has to exist for a 'you' to exist in any given life form. But that leads me down the path of questioning whether each program written on a computer has a special 'you' as well and if it becomes conscious, does it truly become human?",

No, if the lining is flammable the fire will burn the pool lining even if it almost got put out by doing that exact thing just seconds ago! \n \n Finally a rock dosen't remember to hold together, in is under the constant influences of its atoms and their bonds which force it to hold together until something stronger or more resiliant breaks said rock apart. \n \n But hey, if you want to believe energy is made of soul stuff and dreams instead of bosons, go ahead.
