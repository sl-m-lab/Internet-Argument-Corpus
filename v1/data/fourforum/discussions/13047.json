   "Here's the set up for this travesty of justice as exemplified by the Obama plan for stealing elections. We clearly see the intimidation when a Panther caries a baton in order to scare off potention voters who might oppose their choice for President.\n \n YouTube - Voter Intimidation?\n \n And here's the student referred to in the first video.\n \n YouTube - \"Security\" patrols stationed at polling places in Philly\n \n And here's the story about his Justice Department dropping the charges against the Black Panthers intimidating and threatening tactics during the last election.\n \n Charges Against 'New Black Panthers' Dropped by Obama Justice Dept.\n Three men were accused of trying to threaten voters and block poll and campaign workers by the threat of force -- one even brandishing what prosecutors call a deadly weapon.\n \n Members of the New Black Panthers attend a rally outside the Lamar County Courthouse in Paris, Texas November 17, 2008.\n \n The charges stemmed from an incident at a Philadelphia polling place on Election Day 2008 when three members of the party were accused of trying to threaten voters and block poll and campaign workers by the threat of force -- one even brandishing what prosecutors call a deadly weapon.\n \n The three black panthers, Minister King Samir Shabazz, Malik Zulu Shabazz and Jerry Jackson were charged in a civil complaint in the final days of the Bush administration with violating the voter rights act by using coercion, threats and intimidation. Shabazz allegedly held a nightstick or baton that prosecutors said he pointed at people and menacingly tapped it. Prosecutors also say he \"supports racially motivated violence against non-blacks and Jews.\"\n \n The Obama administration won the case last month, but moved to dismiss the charges on May 15.\n \n Click here to see FOX News video from the scene on election day.\n \n Click to watch the incident on YouTube.\n \n The complaint says the men hurled racial slurs at both blacks and whites.\n \n A poll watcher who provided an affidavit to prosecutors in the case noted that Bartle Bull, who worked as a civil rights lawyer in the south in the 1960's and is a former campaign manager for Robert Kennedy, said it was the most blatant form of voter intimidation he had ever seen.\n \n In his affidavit, obtained by FOX News, Bull wrote \"I watched the two uniformed men confront voters and attempt to intimidate voters. They were positioned in a location that forced every voter to pass in close proximity to them. The weapon was openly displayed and brandished in plain sight of voters.\"\n \n He also said they tried to \"interfere with the work of other poll observers ... whom the uniformed men apparently believed did not share their preferences politically,\" noting that one of the panthers turned toward the white poll observers and said \"you are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.\"\n \n A spokesman for the Department of Justice told FOX News, \"The Justice Department was successful in obtaining an injunction that prohibits the defendant who brandished a weapon outside a Philadelphia polling place from doing so again. Claims were dismissed against the other defendants based on a careful assessment of the facts and the law. The department is committed to the vigorous prosecution of those who intimidate, threaten or coerce anyone exercising his or her sacred right to vote.\"\n \n FOX News' Eric Shawn contributed to this report.\n Charges Against 'New Black Panthers' Dropped by Obama Justice Dept. - Political News - FOXNews.com",

There is no evidence linking Obama to the dismissle. However according to the Wash. Times (is that an ok source?)...\n \n From the Washington Times..........\n \nJustice Department political appointees overruled career lawyers and ended a civil complaint accusing three members of the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense of wielding a nightstick and intimidating voters at a Philadelphia polling place last Election Day, according to documents and interviews. \n\n \n ...Obama's appointees did overrule long time DoJ employees.\n \n \nThe incident - which gained national attention when it was captured on videotape and distributed on YouTube - had prompted the government to sue the men, saying they violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act by scaring would-be voters with the weapon, racial slurs and military-style uniforms. \n\n \n This does sound like something that a Court should decide.\n \n \n\n Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as \"the most blatant form of voter intimidation\" that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago. \n\n \n And it appears that at least one Civil Rights Activist agreed (and WITNESSED) that there was voter intimidation.
