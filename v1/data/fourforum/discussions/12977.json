   "A new book: Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond gives an explanation as to why the Earth's wealth is so unfairly distributed amongst the continents, why Africa has been so decimated by colonialism, Asia to some extent but, according to God's plan, North America, particularly the nation of the United States, has flourished and gathered up the wealth of the world.\n \n It would seem that Diamond has it that Europeans and Asians are simply smarter than the other parts of the world.\n \n No, I don't believe that. I believe that the Christian religion played a major role.\n \n First of all, you have the image of a savaged god, covered in blood and gore, as a god. What a compelling image.\n \n An image that drives its believers to don armor, grasp sword and go out and Crusade and conquer and shed blood, for it is truly God's will.\n \n Secondly, the Calvinists who ordained that it was God's divine will that some are rich and some are poor. If you are rich, it is divine proof that God favors you above all others.\n \n A God-justified greed. A compelling belief system.\n \n Now, good Christians, go out and rape and pillage and conquer and grab everything, for that is what your God commands and your bloody God has ordained that it all belongs to you.",

There is a long distance between having the capacity to do evil, and being evil. The Bible reveals humanity to be incomplete, severed as it is from a full experience of God. Christianity is about the slow process of moving back toward God, and to make it easier (for doing it alone would be impossible) God moves alongside us in the person of Jesus and within us in the person of the Holy Spirit. Certainly from time to time we draw away, and even turn our back on God. Salvation is not a binary state, God draws us closer and closer to him as we live as he wants. God can also do the job at the last minute if that's when we give him the opportunity, and that pleases him even more.",

Even the letters from paul, which make up the majority of the new testament, speak a lot more on religious rituals and what makes christianity separate and segregated from the rest of humanity than on how people should harmonize more with the rest of humanity. ?\n\n \n Once again I totally agree with you.\n The Buddha taught an arguably similar philosophy five hundred years before Christ. A Zen story has a Buddhist monk reading some of Christs words from the Bible to his teacher and the teacher saying\" That is excellent! Whoever said that is not far from Buddhahood!\n It is interesting to note that the Buddha did not believe in a Diety\n \n I am not sure whether the old testament has a great deal to do with Christs teachings except for a history of Jesus's peoples and to understand why they turned against him. In the time that Jesus lived being kind to your neighbour was not very high on the Jews agenda. There was very little milk of human kindness from the Roman occupiers so his view on how we should behave to others...turn the other cheek/ give the shirt off your back/ let the one without sin cast the first stone...and how vital they were for you to get into the kingdom of heaven were revolutionary. Unfortunately not the kind of 'revolutionary' the Jews wanted.\n Jesus was brought up in a very closed peasant society and would not have access to any other teachings but the Jewish sect that he belonged to.\n \n \n This brings me to the second point. \n It is pretty clear to me that there must be more than one way find God.\n Otherwise there would millions of human beings that do and have existed without a hope of everlasting life simply because they were unaware of the 'true' path.\n Jesus taught what he did to a illiterate people who did not know anything of other places and societies( the Buddha was a prince and taught educated people as well as peasants)If Jesus died to save all mankind he did so in a very small corner of the world and if his words and actions ( including his terrible death and ultimate resurrection)to these people were to have enough effect on them to produce an initial hard core of followers and to be relevant to others in the future the message must be simple and relevant.\n I believe that is why he never mentions some issues that may have been relevant at the time for instance he might say ' blessed are the poor in spirit for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them' implying that the poor will be sure of heaven , annoying the jewish priests and get away with it for some period but if he said' damned are the slave owners and blessed are the slaves' he would have been crucified a lot sooner.\n \n I believe that Christ's teachings are one way to get to heaven. The death and resurrection of the 'near Buddha' opened up another channel for man to find God.\n On the other hand I may be wrong.\n \n \n \n \nSome other points you raised were quite interesting. You say that there's a possibility that genesis and the concept of young earth creation could be true, and all the physical tangible evidence that suggests exactly the opposite may be God's way of testing us to see whether we'd accept what is allegedly his word over our own eyes.

   "The itself teaches hate, murder, rape, and anything else you could imagine, THAT is why the bible is wrong. THAT is why it could not possibly be the word of god (unless god is evil, which is why I prefer to be atheist). The bible is violent and chauvinistic and teaches hate...'therefore it must be wrong'. Hopefully, the trend will continue and more and more people will turn away from the bible and organized religion in general.?\n\n \n Reading the Bible as the true word of God and coming to that conclusion is not unreasonable.\n But suppose that you believed in two things both non negotiable\n 1 god is kind\n 2 the bible is the word of God.\n Then you cannot come to the same conclusion as you.\n Being a christian with these beliefs is not an easy task!!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhy would god play tidily winks with the truth? Isn't that the devil's purview?\n\n \n Well strangely enough some people believe that very thing.\n That the Devil uses every avenue to pry us from the truth.\n \n I pondered on the question of why every Church tends to drift from what is the original doctrine ( and this is the case for all Churches be it Islam, Christian, buddhist etc).

   "Once again I totally agree with you.\n The Buddha taught an arguably similar philosophy five hundred years before Christ. A Zen story has a Buddhist monk reading some of Christs words from the Bible to his teacher and the teacher saying\" That is excellent! Whoever said that is not far from Buddhahood!\n It is interesting to note that the Buddha did not believe in a Diety\n \n I am not sure whether the old testament has a great deal to do with Christs teachings except for a history of Jesus's peoples and to understand why they turned against him. In the time that Jesus lived being kind to your neighbour was not very high on the Jews agenda. There was very little milk of human kindness from the Roman occupiers so his view on how we should behave to others...turn the other cheek/ give the shirt off your back/ let the one without sin cast the first stone...and how vital they were for you to get into the kingdom of heaven were revolutionary. Unfortunately not the kind of 'revolutionary' the Jews wanted.\n Jesus was brought up in a very closed peasant society and would not have access to any other teachings but the Jewish sect that he belonged to.\n \n\n Quotes from jesus suggests that he learned and believed the torah, which is essentially our old testament. He mentioned the flood, the creation, and many prophetic references. This was customary for all jewish children and it still is a popular practice today.\n \n \nThis brings me to the second point. \n It is pretty clear to me that there must be more than one way find God.\n Otherwise there would millions of human beings that do and have existed without a hope of everlasting life simply because they were unaware of the 'true' path.\n Jesus taught what he did to a illiterate people who did not know anything of other places and societies( the Buddha was a prince and taught educated people as well as peasants)If Jesus died to save all mankind he did so in a very small corner of the world and if his words and actions ( including his terrible death and ultimate resurrection)to these people were to have enough effect on them to produce an initial hard core of followers and to be relevant to others in the future the message must be simple and relevant.\n I believe that is why he never mentions some issues that may have been relevant at the time for instance he might say ' blessed are the poor in spirit for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them' implying that the poor will be sure of heaven , annoying the jewish priests and get away with it for some period but if he said' damned are the slave owners and blessed are the slaves' he would have been crucified a lot sooner.\n \n I believe that Christ's teachings are one way to get to heaven. The death and resurrection of the 'near Buddha' opened up another channel for man to find God.\n On the other hand I may be wrong.\n \n\n Maybe, but for certain that is very unbiblical. And if you're not wrong then we could simply circumvent the bible entirely and follow the less popular by less controversial buddhist path. So again, why even look to the bible at all?\n \n \nBecause the Bible concludes with the story of Christ.\n \n Thank you for your post. I look forward to your comments.\n\n To be fair, the bible concludes with the revelation, chronicling the disastrous end of the world. The story of christ sets the stage for christianity, its like the cake, and the acts and letters of the apostles are like the icing, and revelation is like the pepto bismol you need afterwards. \n \n Personally, and this may seem strange to you, but the story of christ is where I have the most problems with God and the bible. What made christ stand out, other than his philosophy, was his command of supernatural power. No other figure in the bible had such awesome phenomenal power at his fingertips to display at will than did jesus. He was like a historical super hero, using his awesome power for good. And it all made sense: God wouldn't grant such power to anyone unless they were pure of intent and wise enough to use it for good only. Then, on leaving the earth, in his final address, he promised his followers that they too would partake in both his wisdom and his miracle-working power if they held up their end of the bargain and maintained the pure intent. And for a while, jesus seemed to make good on his promises, as we read in the acts, where the disciples raise the dead and perform all sorts of wonderous feat just as jesus did, and just as jesus said they would. \n \n Fast forward to our current era, we see no miracles nor acts of supernatural power. None. Zero. What happened? Did the promise expire 1900 years ago? Did the disciples actually perform the feats as described? Did jesus? Or did he lie about granting the power of God to believers? Or perhaps no other person after the immediate apostles have ever shown themselves to be of pure intent, and christians today are all only fooling themselves? Somewhere along the line something seriously went wrong. \n \n I can't hold anything jesus says in regard because, as great a guy as he seemed to be in theory, when it comes to the one instance when he could really back up all that talk in real life, he fails miserably. \n \n Other than what we read in the bible, what can we see in our current environment that suggests that christianity is a valid religion, or that God is a valid entity?",

He was a failure to his disciples when he the son of God was tortured and was crucified ( although he made up for that with the resurrection). His early followers were persecuted .

   "For me, the bible and the question of the existence of god are two separate questions. I believed in god much longer than I believed in the bible. My eyes were opened to the bible when I sat down and actually read the whole thing cover to cover for the first time. I was 12 years old. Almost immediately I was struck by how transparent and blatantly archaic the text was. It was obvious to me that the words came, not from god, but from ancient farmers and nomads. Some of it was superstitious drivel, some was an apparent attempt to control the masses and empower the status quo, and some of it was simple written history. I think more than anything the story of Job proved to me that the bible wasn't accurate. All of man's petty emotions are projected on god making it obvious that god (at least the biblical one) was indeed created by man in his own image.\n \n Once I figured out that the bible wasn't what it holds itself out to be, I began to look at god itself. Through the next couple of years, I began to really look at the world around me and I began to learn about physics. The world around me was (is) filled with hunger, rape, pedophilia, murder, and pain. What kind of god would create a world and then abandon it to the wolves? As to physics, I learned that the basic rules of the universe are balanced perfectly on a razors edge and allow for things to work in exactly the way we find them to work. There is no god in the equations.\n \n Now the question seemed to be...is there a god that created an imperfect world and then left it mired in s$Rt or is there no god at all. At first glance the effective outcome is the same. Either way we get the world we have now with all the pain and suffering. However, the questions are still important because if there was a 'father' who effectively ignored our plight I'd be even angrier. Without a god, I can effectively put the blame, where it belongs, on the individual wrong doers. Furthermore, I can work toward a better world and not accept the way things are as just 'that's how god made it.'",

   "What would be considered to be the work of God in the past is now known to be ' natural' occurances. However one can rationalise this by considering God as the creator of nature.\n \n\n Walking on water, speaking to the weather and instantaneously restoring sight to the blind are not now known to be natural occurences. There's a reason why the term \"supernatural\" was coined. \n \nIf Gods presence was clearly seen then the unbeliever would be a fool and the choice of whether to follow the word of God or not would be effectively made for us.\n\n So what makes the israelites during the exodus and the jews of jesus' day so special that they could clearly witness God's presence, and still turn back to their wicked ways, but in our time and for the rest of the world population throughout history not even a clue that such a God is anything more than a boogey-man story with bonus features? \n \n Its just like we generally know that completing college, not doing drugs and obeying the law are all good ideas. The negative consequences are very apparent. And people who choose to do the opposite are considered fools. But they still have all the information and make their choice anyway. In the case of God, we have to rely on irrational fundamentalists and a book full of gore, lies and contradictions to make a decision that is supposed to affect our immortal souls for all eternity. What choice is there to be made? \n \n This is one of the reasons I have no problem with atheism. God, if he existed, left the only way to communicate with him and learn about him up to a bunch of uneducated wanderers and greedy priests and kings with personal agendas of power and oppression. And he didn't even bother to proofread the only documentation he left for us. Otherwise he would have obviously picked up on the errors and have it redone until they got it right. Then on top of that, he abandons his domain, for thousands of years, leaving it up to religious zealots to keep the legend alive. Finally, the more we look at the bible, the more evidence we find that it is inconsistent with reality. Things that have been claimed to occur actually never did, and never could have. The bible has turned more rational thinkers to atheism that is has converted them to christianity. The line in my signature is my own realization of this.

   "Walking on water, speaking to the weather and instantaneously restoring sight to the blind are not now known to be natural occurences. There's a reason why the term \"supernatural\" was coined. .\n\n I am not refering to the miracles of Jesus. \n In the days before people knew about yeast it was thought that the brewing of wine and beer was the work of God.\n All natural phenomenon was considered to be the work of God by most of the people.\n \n \n \n \nSo what makes the israelites during the exodus and the jews of jesus' day so special that they could clearly witness God's presence, and still turn back to their wicked ways, but in our time and for the rest of the world population throughout history not even a clue that such a God is anything more than a boogey-man story with bonus features? .\n\n \n The Israelites were stupid. As a matter of fact you could not be more stupid!\n \n \nIts just like we generally know that completing college, not doing drugs and obeying the law are all good ideas. The negative consequences are very apparent. And people who choose to do the opposite are considered fools. But they still have all the information and make their choice anyway. In the case of God, we have to rely on irrational fundamentalists and a book full of gore, lies and contradictions to make a decision that is supposed to affect our immortal souls for all eternity. What choice is there to be made? \n \n This is one of the reasons I have no problem with atheism. God, if he existed, left the only way to communicate with him and learn about him up to a bunch of uneducated wanderers and greedy priests and kings with personal agendas of power and oppression. And he didn't even bother to proofread the only documentation he left for us. Otherwise he would have obviously picked up on the errors and have it redone until they got it right. Then on top of that, he abandons his domain, for thousands of years, leaving it up to religious zealots to keep the legend alive. Finally, the more we look at the bible, the more evidence we find that it is inconsistent with reality. Things that have been claimed to occur actually never did, and never could have. The bible has turned more rational thinkers to atheism that is has converted them to christianity. The line in my signature is my own realization of this. The more you try to study and understand God, the further you take yourself down the path towards atheism. Ask any believer any question about God, and they immediately respond with \"God said it and I believe it\" then almost belittle you for having the audacity to even raise the question. No believer can ever try to understand God, it will almost immediately destroy their faith in him.\n\n \n You have explained quite clearly why you have chosen to become an athiest.\n Would you still be an athiest if Gods presence was clearly seen?\n If you did you would be a fool.\n That is what I posted.",

And many of them were thought to be caused by God for different reasons, which is how most superstitions were created. But that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the claimed works of moses, joshua, elijah and jesus homself, as well as the miracles of john, peter and paul after christ left. Those have never been explained by science. Unfortunately, they don't occur in the present either. \n \n \nThe Israelites were stupid. As a matter of fact you could not be more stupid!\n \n\n That is on the assumption that all these miraculous wonders were actually performed as the bible claimed they were, and were witnessed by these jews. \n \n \nYou have explained quite clearly why you have chosen to become an athiest.\n Would you still be an athiest if Gods presence was clearly seen?\n If you did you would be a fool.\n That is what I posted.\n\n Believe me when I say that I would not only be a believer, I'd be one of the people God would be demonstrating his power through. Growing up in a christian family and being as actively involved in the church as I have been, I would definitely have been a church leader and prominent man of God by now if God was real. \n \n A funny story, when my wife and I got married, she was concerned that she couldn't have kids. She had irregular periods and we've been trying for her to get pregnant but with nothing but false alarms. I remember one night kneeling over her and laying my hands on her belly and body and praying over her with all my might and in the name of jesus. About 3 months later we found that she got pregnant. We have 2 kids now. \n \n So was that the power of God? Did I really lay hands on her and healed her? Up to today she still believes so. The truth is that she possibly never was unable to get pregnant, maybe the timing worked out better when we tried after that night. I'm not convinced. I hear about and even \"witness\" these kinds of phantom miracles all the time, like people having back pain, asthma, migrane headaches, etc, and then after being prayed for these ailments seem to miraculously disappear. Yet we also see instances where these same ailments are healed with no religious intervention. So what kind of miracle is that? My mom witnesses these kinds of miracles everyday! If she can't find her watch, she'd stop looking, pray that God help her find it, then continue looking and viola! She finds it! It must be a miracle! Thank God!\n \n So, hey, maybe I am a fool. Maybe God is really still powerful enough to heal back pains and help women find their watches. But where's the God that can stretch out withered arms, raise parapelegics to their feet and cause food to multiply in his hands? If God is only powerful enough to perform mediocre miracles that are all naturally explainable and only amazing to the uniformed and unscientific, then he can keep his power, and his heaven.",

   "A new book: Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond gives an explanation as to why the Earth's wealth is so unfairly distributed amongst the continents, why Africa has been so decimated by colonialism, Asia to some extent but, according to God's plan, North America, particularly the nation of the United States, has flourished and gathered up the wealth of the world.\n \n It would seem that Diamond has it that Europeans and Asians are simply smarter than the other parts of the world.\n \n No, I don't believe that. I believe that the Christian religion played a major role.\n \n First of all, you have the image of a savaged god, covered in blood and gore, as a god. What a compelling image.\n \n An image that drives its believers to don armor, grasp sword and go out and Crusade and conquer and shed blood, for it is truly God's will.\n \n Secondly, the Calvinists who ordained that it was God's divine will that some are rich and some are poor. If you are rich, it is divine proof that God favors you above all others.\n \n A God-justified greed. A compelling belief system.\n \n Now, good Christians, go out and rape and pillage and conquer and grab everything, for that is what your God commands and your bloody God has ordained that it all belongs to you.\n\n \n Simone, did you even read the book?
