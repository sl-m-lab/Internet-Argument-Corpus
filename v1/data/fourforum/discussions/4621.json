   "From the Sunday Times book review ofTHE PASSION: The True Story of an Event that Changed Human History, by Geza Vermes\nMany academics have diligently worked away on the gospels separating the wheat from the chaff, but few can rival Geza Vermes, Professor Emeritus of Jewish studies at Oxford. His background gives him a certain objectivity. As a former Catholic priest who has returned to his Jewish roots, he tends to see the events described without party political bias. He is also a populariser, unafraid to challenge and unwilling to patronise. Over the past four decades, Vermes has been picking away with forensic skill at the Gospels to reveal them in a truer light. In The Passion, he distils that accumulated wisdom into a brief, punchy and thought-provoking account of Jesus's last hours.\n \n < -- snip -- <\n \n Here, Vermes's detective work takes on a bigger context. Did all the Gospel writers distort their account to blame the Jews rather than the Roman colonisers for the death of Jesus? It would seem so. It was therefore arguably these writers who gave rise to 2,000 years of Christian anti-semitism.\n\n The Passion, along with a handful of highly questionable anti-Pharisee tales, served as rationalization for a \"replacement theology\" within the predominantly Gentile proto-Christian sect. Earlier, John Dominic Crossan (Who Killed Jesus?: Exposing the Roots of Anti-Semitism in the Gospel Story of the Death of Jesus) and now Geza Vermes suggest that these tales were little more than anti-Judaic, Roman-friendly fabrications. If so, the ideological justification of two millennia of pogrom and persecution is reduced to 'pious fraud'.\n \n So the question is:Is the 'replacement theology' the result and antisemitism the legacy of a Christian lie?",

   "So the question is:Is the 'replacement theology' the result and antisemitism the legacy of a Christian lie?\n\n \n \n There is no \"replacement theology\" being used in the gospels. Whoever wrote the gospels told it like was. The jews have always protested their protrayal in Jesus's death, because they assume it cast them in a negative light. No anti-semitism was intended by the account of Jesus's death. It no more means discrimination than if I said an Italian shot the President. I wouldn't expect people to start discriminating against all Italians. I have no doubt that anti-semitism has happened in the past, but I would find it suspect that it was based solely on the account of Jesus's death. If the apostle's were trying to stir up hatred for the Jews, why did they continue to preach to them? Why did none of their messages infer the Jews were to be hated? Christians, Turks and Muslims have been presented as the \"bad guys\" at one time or another so why should the Jews take exception?",

   "I was against the idea that all Jews were oppressed by Christians, because it was believed that they killed Jesus. I'll take my chances with the rest. :)\n\n Very well ...\n \nFrom the time of Paul, when Christianity began to drop Jewish ways, it also claiming the place of Judaism as the 'new Israel'. Christianity claimed to be replacement of Judaism and that all had been summed up in Christ. Supercessionism, as it came to be called, was used to justify atrocities committed against the Jews -- the burning of synagogues, pogroms, especially on Good Friday and during Holy Week, and the killing and maiming of Jews.\n \n Jews were called 'God killers' from as early as the second century. A little later, Augustine said that the Jews should not be killed, as they were a witness to the race from which Christ came. During the Crusades Jews were slaughtered in the name of religion. Blood libels, where Jews were accused of heinous crimes such as drinking the blood of children at Passover, became occasions for persecution. 'Away with them at all costs' was Luther's proposal for solving the 'Jewish question' of his day. Luther's anti-Semitism was in fact appropriated by the Nazis, who quoted his writings to justify and legitimize their persecution of the Jews.\n \n History cannot be changed. The fact remains that Christianity separated from Judaism with much bitterness and bloodshed, and that persecution of the Jews, and accusations of deicide and pogroms plagued them throughout the centuries. By the twentieth century, the time was ripe for the most horrendous crime against the Jews of all, the Nazi holocaust, where the aim was to wipe out the name of Jews from the earth. The teachings of Christianity, which said it had superseded Judaism, that it was the new Israel, that the Jews were God killers, had prepared the climate that made the Nazi Holocaust possible. Six million Jews were eliminated in as many years. The fact remains that the teachings of Christianity prepared the way for this atrocity. \n \n - see Online Catholics\n\n \n'Deicide and the Jews'\n General Convention of the Episcopal Church (U.S.A.)\n \n (General Convention Journal of 1964, pp. 279-280)\n \n Whereas Within the Church, throughout the centuries, loveless attitudes including the charge of deicide, have frequently resulted in persecution of the Jewish people and a concomitant revulsion on the part of the Jewish people towards the un-Christ-like witness thus made; and\n \n Whereas, Obedience to the Lord of the Church requires an honest and clear expression of love for our neighbour; and\n \n Whereas, Persecution of the Jews has been recently intensified in certain areas of the world; and\n \n Whereas, Lack of communication between Christians and Jews, and the resulting ignorance and suspicion of each other, has been a barrier to Christian obedience of the Law of Love; be it\n \n Resolved, the House of Bishops concurring, That the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, meeting in St. Louis in October, 1964, reject the charge of deicide against the Jews and condemn anti-Semitism; and be it further\n \n Resolved, the House of Bishops concurring, That the General Convention condemn unchristian accusations against the Jews; and that this Church seek positive dialogue with appropriate representative bodies of the Jewish Faith; and be it further\n \n Resolved, the House of Bishops concurring, That the substance of this Resolution be referred to the Joint Commission on Ecumenical Relations for continuing study and suggested implementation.top of page\n \n - see Jewish-Christian Relations\n\n \n\"The American Lutheran Church and the Jewish Community\"\n \n Christians must also become aware of that history in which they have deeply alienated the Jews. It is undeniable that Christian people have both initiated and acquiesced in persecution. Whole generations of Christians have looked with contempt upon this people who were condemned to remain wanderers on the earth on the false charge of deicide. Christians ought to acknowledge with repentance and sorrow their part in this tragic history of estrangement. Since anti-Jewish prejudice is still alive in many parts of the world, Christians need to develop a sympathetic understanding of the renewal among Jews of the terror of the Holocaust. It is as if the numbness of the injury has worn off, old wounds have been reopened, and Jews live in dread of another disaster. Christians must join with Jews in the effort to understand the theological and moral significance of what happened in the Holocaust.\n \n - see General Convention of the American Lutheran Church\n\n \n Please let me know if you would like to pursue this further. emoticon_rolleyes",

I also didn't realize I was defending the position that there was no history of Christian progoms against Jews, considering I never said there wasn't.

I'll take my chances with the rest. :)\n\n \n I wouldn't go so far as to say that 'all' Jews have been oppressed by Christians, but the history and the numbers appear to be significant. I give you, for example...\n \n What shall we Christians do with this rejected and condemned people, the Jews? Since they live among us, we dare not tolerate their conduct, now that we are aware of their lying and reviling and blaspheming. If we do, we become sharers in their lies, cursing and blaspemy. Thus we cannot extinguish the unquenchable fire of divine wrath, of which the prophets speak, nor can we convert the Jews. With prayer and the fear of God we must pratice a sharp mercy to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames.\n \n First to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them. This is to be done in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, so that God might see that we are Christians, and do not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying, cursing, and blaspheming of his Son and of his Christians.\n \n Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed. For they pursue in them the same aims as in their synagogues. Instead they might be lodged under a roof or in a barn, like the gypsies.\n \n Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing and blasphemy are taught, be taken from them.\n \n Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb.\n \n Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews. For they have no business in the countryside, since they are not lords, officials, tradesmen, or the like. Let they stay at home.\n \n From: Martin Luther, The Jews and Their Lies\n \n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/luther-jews.html",
