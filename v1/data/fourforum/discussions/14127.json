I sincerely hope you might heed his words. \n   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\"  Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n\n \n   Testimony of Eugene Volokh on the Second Amendment, Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, Sept. 23, 1998. \n 1.The Text of the Amendment Refers to an Individual Right\n \n The Second Amendment, like the First, Fourth, and Ninth Amendments, refers to a \"right of the people,\" not a right of the states or a right of the National Guard. The First Amendment guarantees the people's right to assemble; the Fourth Amendment protects the people's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures; the Ninth Amendment refers to the people's unenumerated rights. 1 These rights are clearly individual -- they protect \"the right of the people\" by protecting the right of each person. This strongly suggests that the similarly-worded Second Amendment likewise secures an individual right. \n\n That is what the Heller court says too, except it is now proven fact!",
