   "What about love as a reason?\n \n\n \n Well, I would say tha love enhances all of those reasons I mentioned above, but I don`t think it is a reason in itself.\n \n \nSo you're talking about serial monogamy. Aren't you still sharing your girlfriend sexually then? \n\n \n I think that if you look at the reasons I listed above you`ll see that they aren`t concerned with my girlfriends past or future experience with other men (other than the STD thing, but I think everyone should test themselves when entering into a new relationship and after that it only applies to the present). I don`t think you share your girlfriend sexually if she have had sexual experiences with others before you or after you.\n \n \nWhy do gays wish to choose monogamy in a marital context? ('til death do us part)\n\n \n For the same reasons as many childless heterosexuals do it. Because it is an act to confirm their love and it can serve as a bulwark against a break up if the times becomes rough. It is also a nice cermony and it makes your friends and family happy and/or proud. :)",

   " Why do gays wish to choose monogamy in a marital context? ('til death do us part)\n\n \n Because they love each other so much that they could never desire anyone else, and they want to announce it to the world. 'Girlfriend' or 'boyfriend' could be used to describe a teenage fling, but they now that what they have is so much more. To have their love so great that death of their spouse would be a million times worse than there own, their love that shall last their lifetimes and maybe longer, treated like a little temporary thing upsets them. A man's boyfriend had a heart attack and died in the ambulance. He wasn't able to say goodbye, because he couldn't ride on the ambulance with him. Only family members, including spouses, could ride in the ambulance with the patient.",
