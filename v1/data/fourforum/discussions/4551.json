   "What is the reality of Internet censorship? This is a general question I hear asked by many, prehaps not in that form but with that general idea in mind. Is government interference a good thing or does it already damage what some people believe to be a society on the brink of destruction. Knowledge is the key for the survival of humanity. With censorship the resources we have to gain knowledge become increasingly more limited. I'd like to hear other opinions on not only Internet censorship but all censorship. Internet censorship has become incresingly more prevelant in our everday lives. Is there a way for the general public to fight back against the government and the powerful select few who are the leaders and those in charge whgo we did not select? Can we find a way to win? I believe we can but it will take years and decades and possibly a generation or two to get to a point in which we have fully ensured the fulfillment of the First Amendmant and have total freedom of speech. Thoughts on the topic? . . .",

I`m saying that supply and demand causes the crime. One way to fight the crimes is to have a go at the supply side (by tracking down producers of kiddie-porn). But it is not enough.

I'll also add though, that its human nature not to care about the suffering of others unless directly confronted with it...\n\n \n Yeah, I agree that it won`t shut the industry down.\n \n As for human nature. I wouldn`t be so sure... Human nature seems to be a social construct rather than some objective or biological truth.\n \n \nActually supply and demand does not cause anything, supply and demand is merely an economic measure of how best to sell goods. Supply and demand more or less means, if I flood the market with a product, and it meets the demand, but I still have more product left, I will have to decrease the price in order to try to appeal to a greater market.

That means more videos will be made, less will be produced, and more money will be paid for them. Going after the demand only means you stop the less wealthy from acquiring what they want, the rich and capable will always have the means.\n\n \n Hmm.. I think you got it a bit wrong. Supply is a term refering to what quantity of a certain something that is availiable. In economics, it is often used as a term describing availiable quantities as a funktion of the price. Likewise, demand is a term refering to what quantity of a certain something is wanted. In economic terms, it is often used as a term describing wanted quanteties as a function of the price. It is true that one could use the relationship between supply and demand to gauge how you should price a product or service. Alternatively it could be used to gauge how much you should produce. But this is far from the only way to use this relationship. \n \n Basicly, what I tried to convey by refering to supply and demand in my previous post was that one can impose \"costs\" on both the supply side and the demand side on a market through legislation. By making the production of a certain good or service (in this case; kiddie-porn) illegal, you impose an external cost on the produktion. Reducing the quantities produced at any given price. Likewise, you can, by making consumtion of kiddie-porn illegal, impose an external cost to the consumtion. Reducing the quantities demanded at any given price. By approaching the problem from both sides, one can decrease the quantity kiddie-porn produced and consumed. And by doing so, decreasing the number of kids being exploited and raped.\n \n \nAgain our laws are not based on moral issues alone, and certainly not focused and obsessed like you seem to be with kiddie porn. There is a bigger picture out there, can we please step outside of this box.\n\n \n Okey, let`s step outside the box. Could you please tell me how your government is making infringements on your freedom of speach, except for things like kiddie-porn and certain documents/information that could threaten the security of your nation. Alternativle threaten the life or physical wellbeing of another individual (like wittness protection programes and such)?",

   "Yes, anything can be censored, but any censoring can also be taken to court. So ultimately its for the courts to apply.\n\n \n My point is that school is not a public place. It shares some characteristics with a public place, but ultimatly it`s a workplace for pupils, staff and teachers. Therefor, freedom of speach does not automaticly apply. In a school, freedom of speach is a privilege. One that I think should be protected, but I would be surprised if your constitution really have anything to do with it. \n \n If we look at it this way. Can teachers say anything they want during class without being punished? Can they rant about Osama being the best guy ever and that 9/11 was the best thing that has hapened this century without losing his/her job? Freedom of speach obviously does not apply to the teacher (or staff) in the school enviroment. The pupils on the other hand can say basicly anything they like, unles they disrespect their own classmates or their teachers. If they do, the school may punish them. They are also restricted when and where they can speak at all (like the in a test situation). Furthermore, I would be surprised if pupils would be allowed to spread political propaganda and/or various commercial messages at large scale. \n \n Now, granted, courts do ultimatly decide wether a school has acted outside its boundaries. But the same applies to any private employer or institution. A school has certain obligations. Encourage free and critical thinking is one among them. To restrict speach in a unjustified manner would be a clear breach of this obligation. But when it is justified, even your courts would accept restrictions on the speach of the pupils, don`t you think?",

   "Hehe... I love how we`ve gone from internet censorship to freedom of speach in schools :)\n \n \n \n Now, don`t confuse publicly owned facility with public space. Public ownership of an institution does not make it a public space. Just like town hall is apublic facility, doesn`t give me the right to be there whenever I feel like it. \n \n If I put it like this, many states in the US has \"conceiled carry laws\", right? In those states, would an 18 year old student be allowed to carry inside school property? If not, you can`t equate the school with a public place.

It is a public place and has to adhere to other ruled unless it obstructs teaching and learning. It is possible to learn while reading Harry Potterr. It's not possible to learn while a kid is shouting at his desk at the top of his lungs. Kids do not shed their rights while in school.\n \n Back to censorship: since you complained :)\n \n Kids are minors and should be treated as such. It's the place of the school to be temporary parents while kids are going. They can censor stuff that they think parents may take offense to, but MUST allow the kid access to it if the kid comes in with a note from the parent authorizing them to read it. This is a public facility that is funded with taxpayer money and is for the public. They still have to give the rights guarenteed by the Constitution to all kids unless they prohibit a safe learning environment. Schools have tried to argue that sitting during the pledge prohibits the learning environment but this has been overturned by the courts just as not allowing a kid with a note access to a banned book.",

   "Actually, I believe the named materials are actually also outlets. The balance between the two aspects is, of course, undeterminable.\n \n Personally, I think the outlet might be stronger, since violent crime existed even while these materials were not available through the internet.",
