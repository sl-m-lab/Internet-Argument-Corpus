   "But it does teach an important lesson. Just remember next time you curse at your computer, get angry at high gas prices, or rush through a meal. You are very privelaged to simply have food, a car, and a computer. Just the fact that you don't have to worry about where to get the next meal means you are in the minority. Although I don't believe in God (the freedom to do this is rare as well), it sometimes makes me look up and say thank you for how fortunate I've been in life, compared to the rest of the world. But then I also wish that I could sacrifice some things for the others in the world less fortunate than I. I already donate some money to charities such as the Red Cross, but sometimes I wish I could do something more. When I see stats like these it's just depressing after I get passed the fact that I am indeed an extremely lucky person. As we climb in our cars bi***ing about gas prices, and how much our computer crashes, just think about how many people would literally kill to be in your place.",
