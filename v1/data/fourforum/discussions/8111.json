   "Here is a list of Christian Clergy that is fighting the Fundamentalist anti-intellectualism and quite plainly accepting the fact that the theory of evolution has massive amounts of evidence for it.\n \n from http://www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/religion_science_collaboration.htm\n \n \n\n Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible - the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark - convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.\n \n We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as \"one theory among others\" is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.\n \n\n \n Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter.",

   "Creationism is often disparaged, and rightfully so.\n \n The fact creationism is often disparaged does not change the scientific definition of evolution. \n\n \n But that definition gets confusing when several evolutionists here claim that creationism cannot be proven or disproven, while other evolutionists here (such as many in the thread that I linked above) claim that it is possible, or that it has been done. Why is it that when the claim is made here that creationism is disproven, the other evolutionists (who claim that it's not possible to prove or disprove the supernatural) are silent about it? In the link I referred to above, why is it that 20 posters downplayed creationism, and 0 posters took exception to this \"proof\" that creationism could be disproven? Does it become any easier to see why many creationists can distrust evolutionists?\n \n \n \n \nIf creationist literature concerned itself only with creation per se, there could be no scientific objection to it. \n\n \n Much I.D. literature concerns itself ONLY with designed systems. Yet there's plenty of scientific objection to it. \n \n \n For example, were I to claim the universe were supernaturally created 3 seconds ago in such a way that it appeared to have been emerged some 10 billion years ago, we could only say that such an extraodinary claim is unecessary to explain the world as we know it. If I claimed to have scientific proof of supernatural creation, this would be open to criticism on the grounds that the supernatural cannot be scientifically tested - this would not disprove the claim of supernatural creation, only reveal the misuse of science in attempting to test for it.\n\n \n Yet many here misuse science attempting to disprove supernatural creation. Why do you give them a free pass? Why should society give them a free pass?\n \n \n \nThe majority of creationist literature however is of the \"creation science\" variety, which concerns itself with claiming evolution does not occur (on scientific grounds), that the earth is only 6000 years old (on the basis of geological / radiological evidence), that a global flood occured wiping out life on earth in Noah's time (again on the basis of scientific evidence), that it is impossible for certain things to have evolved (on scientific evidence), and it is these faulty scientific claims to which criticism of creationism is specifically addressed. \n\n \n So you're saying that science finds it's greatest threat from creationism concerning paleontology and archaeology? When looking at how the money flows politically, it's easy to see that science sees it's greatest threat coming from the morality of creationism - that humans are a level above animals - that humans were created with unalienable rights. It provides so many roadblocks to what today's science wants to concern itself with. You can say that I'm shreiking \"conspiracy theory\" all you want, but the political action in the scientific community over the last 50 or so years is documented in black & white.\n \n \nI hope you have not confused scientific opposition to \"creation science\" as meaning scientific opposition to supernatural creation per se.\n\n \n They are the same.

The beginning was in the mid to late 1800's, when evolutionists aim was to counter religion, the religion that provided the guidelines for the founding of the U.S. Their aim peaked a few decades ago, even though they were not only coming up short in providing answers for origins questions, they were discovering more and more complexity in the simplest forms of life. Newly identified ID proponents began to question how evolutionists could continually filter what evidence backed up their claims, and ignore new information that did not. \n \n \n \nThe agenda is to prove the veracity of their faith.

One major reason is that many people have a sort of vested interest in this theory. Jobs would be lost, loss of face would result, text books would need to be eliminated or revised. \n\n \n And another;\n \n \nColumnist George Caylor once interviewed a molecular biologist for an article entitled \"The Biologist,\" that ran on February 17, 2000, in The Ledger (Lynchburg, VA), and is in part reprinted here as a conversation between \"G: (Caylor) and \"J\" (the scientist). We joint the piece in the middle of a discussion about the complexity of human code.\n \n G: \"Do you believe that the information evolved?\"\n \n J: \"George, nobody I know in my profession believes it evolved. It was engineered by genius beyond genius, and such information could not have been written any other way. The paper and ink did not write the book! Knowing what we know, it is ridiculous to think otherwise.\"\n \n G: \"Have you ever stated that in a public lecture, or in any public writings?\"\n \n J: \"No, I just say it evolved. To be a molecular biologist requires one to hold onto two insanities at all times. One, it would be insane to believe in evolution when you can see the truth for yourself. Two, it would be insane to say you don't believe evolution. All government work, research grants, papers, big college lectures -- everything would stop. I'd be out of a job, or relegated to the outer fringes where I couldn't earn a decent living.\n \n G: I hate to say it, but that sounds intellectually dishonest.\n \n J: The work I do in genetic research is honorable. We will find the cures to many of mankind's worst diseases. But in the meantime, we have to live with the elephant in the living room.\n\n \n Who really knows how many scientists claim to be evolutionists when they are actually not, just to keep their job - just for political purposes.\n \n \n \n \nGenuine science does not have an agenda, no matter how much you believe it is part of an atheist anti-god conspiracy. Science looks at facts, and draws conclusions from those facts, whatever those conclusions might be, no matter how unpopular they are. So far, the facts all point to evolutionary descent from a common ancestor. \n\n \n Facts don't point to it - presenters of facts point to it. As you can see from the quotes above, it is too entrenched politically for any new unpopular discovery to significantly change. Todays science has one over-riding satisfaction; that this world belongs to them and to them alone. Any new unpopular discovery about ID isn't going to change it. \n \n \n \nThe facts also suggest that every example used to 'prove' ID is flawed. \n\n \n Again, facts don't suggest it, presenters of facts do. \n \n \nIf these examples were not flawed, science would be forced to consider ID as a valid alternative to evolution. \n\n \n Darwinian claims of natural selection are also flawed when held up to recent discoveries about the complexities of life, and other things.

I believe that anti ID scientists agenda threatens the text of the constitution and the intent of the framers far more than the agenda of pro ID scientists. \n\n \n OK, I assume that by the two worldviews you mean atheism and faith. The thing is, I would suggest that any scientist who is true to principles and whom I would respect would not allow his beliefs to hinder potential genuine science.\n \n This is why I find your obvious belief in \"anti-ID\" scientists nonsensical because you just can't think of a theory having people pro or anti towards it. The best example is the current mass of theories trying to bring together quantum mechanics and relativity. I think there are about 5 or 6 theories, all of which show promise and all of which are being worked on. \n \n The problem ID has, is that it's central texts (eg Behe's Black Box) have been convincingly refuted as has every example of irreducible complexity. This is not because scientists have set out to disprove ID, it is because they have set out to test it. They have been presented with a concept that in theory challenges decades or centuries of hard scientific labour. \n \n So they investigate, test the theory as rigourously as any new theory, particularly controvesial ones. For example, someone suggests an example of irreducible complexity, so a bunch of biologists spend some time looking at that in detail, and learn some pretty amazing things about evolution at the genetic level, and have invariably found that what they discover does not support the ID hypothesis which is in fact what it is. Don't see this as an insult of any kind, but the hard fact is that a hypothesis needs a substantial body of evidence to support it before it becomes a theory. \n \n ID just does not have this. In fact, in my view, the very way ID is presented just doesn't sound like science; its very foundation is the belief that some things are beyond understanding. The foundation of science is philosophy, which is an open-ended search for truth, and science is similarly open-ended; it will never consider that anything could be unknowable. ID puts a limit on aspects of knowledge: in terms of irreducible complexity, ID (and creationism in general) says we can work it back to a certain point, but before that it was all God. \n \n I'm sure I'm not going to alter your beliefs but surely you can see that these reasons underlie the failure of ID to gain respectability within the scientific community far more than any even subconcious 'worldview bias'. \n \n \nBut that wasn't the beginning. The beginning was in the mid to late 1800's, when evolutionists aim was to counter religion, the religion that provided the guidelines for the founding of the U.S.\n \n \n Again here is the crux of the matter: The fact that the ToE contradicted some specific aspects of dogma does not mean by extension that anyone was out to 'counter' religion. I can say confidently that it probably contributed to the increase in atheism, but this is not deliberate on anyone's part, it is just social change.

It's an ambitious and awe-inspiring undertaking that we are pursuing as a species. I have only known one bloke in my life who was a total creationist.

In fact, it's usually the major breakthroughs that, in answering some questions, throw up new ones. But this is to be expected. You just get on with it and try and answer the new questions.\n \n \nFacts don't point to it - presenters of facts point to it. As you can see from the quotes above, it is too entrenched politically for any new unpopular discovery to significantly change. Todays science has one over-riding satisfaction; that this world belongs to them and to them alone. Any new unpopular discovery about ID isn't going to change it.\n \n \n Sorry, but no. The facts, if accurate, will always win out over entrenched beliefs.

You can't do it by picking holes in unfinished areas of the theory, which, no offense, seems to be a disproprtionately large element of ID and 'creation science'.\n \n Sorry, I've rambled on for ages.

   "OK, I assume that by the two worldviews you mean atheism and faith. The thing is, I would suggest that any scientist who is true to principles and whom I would respect would not allow his beliefs to hinder potential genuine science. \n\n \n Do you think the majority of non-creation scientists are that way? There are many anti-creationists who post on these forums who claim to have science degrees. Do you think they do a good job of representing all non-creationist scientists? I think they do, and I think their beliefs dictate their thoughts concerning science.\n \n \nThis is why I find your obvious belief in \"anti-ID\" scientists nonsensical because you just can't think of a theory having people pro or anti towards it. The best example is the current mass of theories trying to bring together quantum mechanics and relativity. I think there are about 5 or 6 theories, all of which show promise and all of which are being worked on. \n\n \n Science would involve far fewer people, and far fewer dollars, if actual \"genuine\" science was all it was interested in. Some of science is genuine, but much of it is entertainment. When it comes to entertainment dollars, genuineness will take a back seat. \n \n \nThe problem ID has, is that it's central texts (eg Behe's Black Box) have been convincingly refuted as has every example of irreducible complexity. This is not because scientists have set out to disprove ID, it is because they have set out to test it. They have been presented with a concept that in theory challenges decades or centuries of hard scientific labour. \n\n \n They can't have that hard labor reversed because money is involved. They are commited to Darwinism, no matter what. I haven't looked very deeply into the irreducible complexity refutations - I've seen one claim about it that tells me all I need to know. In the case of Behe's mousetrap, his basic claim of course is that if any one piece is missing, all the remaining parts do nothing at all. The claim by some evolutionists was that it didn't need a base - it could be set on the floor. Really? The floor became the base. There's nothing in science that presupposes the existance of floors. It was such an elementary, knee jerk reaction by evolutionists that there's no question in my mind that they set out to disprove it. \n \n \nSo they investigate, test the theory as rigourously as any new theory, particularly controvesial ones. For example, someone suggests an example of irreducible complexity, so a bunch of biologists spend some time looking at that in detail, and learn some pretty amazing things about evolution at the genetic level, and have invariably found that what they discover does not support the ID hypothesis which is in fact what it is. \n\n \n What they discovered didn't support ID, they knew it before they started, it was a \"top down\" theory, as you described for ID proponents. It goes both ways, and they are exactly the same. Worldviews, pride, and money always dictate it. \n \n \nDon't see this as an insult of any kind, but the hard fact is that a hypothesis needs a substantial body of evidence to support it before it becomes a theory. \n\n \n When a hint of worldviews / entertainment are involved, a substantial body of money is involved.\n \n \nID just does not have this. In fact, in my view, the very way ID is presented just doesn't sound like science; its very foundation is the belief that some things are beyond understanding. The foundation of science is philosophy, which is an open-ended search for truth, and science is similarly open-ended; it will never consider that anything could be unknowable. ID puts a limit on aspects of knowledge: in terms of irreducible complexity, ID (and creationism in general) says we can work it back to a certain point, but before that it was all God. \n\n \n There seems to be disagreement among atheist science about that, according to what I've seen on these forums. Many atheists seem to believe that we can only work back to a certain point, that some things are beyond human understanding.\n \n \n \n \nI'm sure I'm not going to alter your beliefs but surely you can see that these reasons underlie the failure of ID to gain respectability within the scientific community far more than any even subconcious 'worldview bias'. \n\n \n Worldview bias, combined with money and entertainment value - no, I can't see it. \n \n \n \n \nAgain here is the crux of the matter: The fact that the ToE contradicted some specific aspects of dogma does not mean by extension that anyone was out to 'counter' religion. I can say confidently that it probably contributed to the increase in atheism, but this is not deliberate on anyone's part, it is just social change. Science has offered an alternative to faith, but after that it is up to the individual to choose, either exclusively or any combination of both. \n\n \n Science can't offer an alternative to faith for two reasons IMO;\n \n 1) Science isn't the only source of knowledge.\n 2) Atheist science has too many gaps to consider itself to be above faith.\n \n \nThe appeal of science (at least to me) is its exuberant, almost arrogant confidence is its determination to understand everything, able and willing to scrap everything and start again as many times as necessary, unable to conceive of giving up. It's an ambitious and awe-inspiring undertaking that we are pursuing as a species. I have only known one bloke in my life who was a total creationist. While I admit I kind of looked down on him at first, I soon realised he was an intelligent guy who just didn't see what I see in science, although to this day I can't fathom just why not. \n\n \n It won't scrap Darwinism, no matter what. If Darwin would have realized that the universe wasn't eternal (that it had a beginning) or if he would have had any idea of the complexity of cells, he would have probably scrapped it, if he didn't care about entertainment & money.\n \n \n \n \nAs almost every field of science does. In fact, it's usually the major breakthroughs that, in answering some questions, throw up new ones. But this is to be expected. You just get on with it and try and answer the new questions. \n\n \n And a basic new one is ID. In the U.S. we try to answer new ones by politically blocking thought about them in school classrooms.\n \n \n \n \nSorry, but no. The facts, if accurate, will always win out over entrenched beliefs. Again, in physics, relativity and quantum mechanics shook the foundations of knowledge but being accurate, predictive theories they gained acceptance. In relation to this, and you're not going to like me for saying this, but on a large scale, science has shaken the foundations of the oldest entrenched idea of all, that of religion. This goes back to Galileo disproving the entrenched church-sanctioned belief that the sun goes round the earth. \n\n \n I don't mind your saying that part at all, because it's true. But science hasn't done it alone - the atheist worldview has helped it a lot. Funny how the Bible never clearly says that the sun goes around the earth. The Bible never clearly says anything that controdicts anything that science has discovered. If it seems to, it's only because the Bible is being metaphoric. It's purpose is to instruct us how to behave much more than entertain us with facts about astronomy.\n \n \n \nNobody thinks anything \"must have evolved\". We have the theory, proposed by Darwin, added to by others, and we find that the vast majority of evidence supports it, particularly in the field of genetics. The concept of a supernatural cause is literally meaningless to the scientific method, but this does not entail a rejection of spirituality. It does, however entail accepting theories that describe a system to the extent that you can make all sorts of predictions about that system's behaviour. To me this seems like common sense. \n\n \n If only it were that simple. A supernatural cause is far from being the only thing that is meaningless to the scientific method. Things like morality, tradition, and many other important, useful things are also meaningless to the scientific method.\n \n \nIt doesn't matter if the theories sound far-fetched, or if they contradict aspects of an entrenched belief, because if the predictions can be repeatedly and consistently demonstrated, how can you question the theory? You can do it by coming up with a more accurate theory, but that's the only way. You can't do it by picking holes in unfinished areas of the theory, which, no offense, seems to be a disproprtionately large element of ID and 'creation science'. \n\n \n \"Picking holes in unfinished areas of the theory\"?? Like the picking of holes in ID?? Picking holes can be a disproportionately large element of atheist science too. Again, it goes both ways.\n \n \nSorry, I've rambled on for ages.

After all, it's only for entertainment...\n \n \nI haven't looked very deeply into the irreducible complexity refutations\n\n You really need to look deeper, because you clearly don't understand either the claim or the refutations.\n \n \nI've seen one claim about it that tells me all I need to know. In the case of Behe's mousetrap, his basic claim of course is that if any one piece is missing, all the remaining parts do nothing at all.

The floor became the base.\n\n But the mousetrap is a rather bad example of irreducible complexity. How about you apply the concept to an actual biological system that replicates imperfectly? The mousetrap example is a very poor illustration of the concept.\n Furthermore, your claim is incorrect. The floor did not \"become the base.\" Yet further, if the mousetrap was suspended, you would be up in arms because there would need to be something holding it up. If it floated, you'd cry bloody murder that some magical force was making it float. Instead, your objection is that it sits on the floor? Get real.\n \n \nWhat they discovered didn't support ID, they knew it before they started, it was a \"top down\" theory, as you described for ID proponents. It goes both ways, and they are exactly the same. Worldviews, pride, and money always dictate it.\n\n Miller showed that Behe's flagellum is not irreducible. A recent study showed that a \"lock and key\" enzyme interaction that meets Behe's definition of irreducibly complex evolved naturally. This alone proves that biological structures that are allegedly unevolvable according to Behe can indeed evolve. People educated in evolution (unlike Behe) know perfectly well that things that might fit Behe's original definition of \"irreducible complexity\" are not unevolvable due to processes like exaptation. (This is why Behe has had to change the definition, and why Dembski has changed it yet again.)\n \n \nThere seems to be disagreement among atheist science about that, according to what I've seen on these forums. Many atheists seem to believe that we can only work back to a certain point, that some things are beyond human understanding.\n\n The way science works is by not invoking unneeded principles, and by not saying \"we can't learn anything more about it.\" By saying \"Goddidit,\" cdesign proponentsists do both. Whatever you seem to think people can and can't understand doesn't bother me, because you are demonstrably wrong.\n \n \nScience can't offer an alternative to faith for two reasons IMO;\n\n Mind you, science doesn't try to do so.\n \n \n2) Atheist science has too many gaps to consider itself to be above faith.\n\n This looks like a rewording of the God of the Gaps fallacy, complete with marc's habitual labeling of science as \"atheistic.\"\n \n \n...

If he had been interested only in money, he wouldn't have waited so long to publish his findings.\n \n \nAnd a basic new one is ID.\n\n But ID doesn't ask any new questions, and it only \"solves\" old questions by appealing to a fallacy.\n \n \nIn the U.S. we try to answer new ones by politically blocking thought about them in school classrooms.\n\n Hello?

Remember that Judge Jones is an evangelical Christian, and given the opportunity to allow ID in schools, he instead blasted the cdesign proponentsists for promoting such sham science and violating the First Amendment.\n \n \nThe Bible never clearly says anything that controdicts anything that science has discovered. If it seems to, it's only because the Bible is being metaphoric. It's purpose is to instruct us how to behave much more than entertain us with facts about astronomy.\n\n Nice doublespeak. Here's the translation: \"The Bible is always correct. When the Bible is not correct, it is because the Bible is being metaphoric.\" When the Bible says that pi is three, the Bible is being \"metaphoric\"? Is the Bible being metaphoric in Genesis 6 when it says that two fowls of each kind were taken on the ark, or was it being metaphoric in Genesis 7 when it says seven fowls of each kind were taken on the ark? Did Jesus send his disciples to bring him two animals (Matthew 21) or only one (Mark 11)?

For example, many psychology experiments are now limited by a code of ethics.\n When searching for truth, tradition should be one of the first things to go.\n Will you ever move beyond your futile strawmen and ad hominem attacks and actually make a substantive argument?\n \n \n\"Picking holes in unfinished areas of the theory\"??

Yet before that happens, it deserves a fair chance to succeed. \n\n \n Science is afraid to give it that chance.\n \n \nOne of my main motivations in writing this book is to free science from arbitrary constraints that, in my view, stifle inquiry, undermine education, turn scientists into a secular priesthood, and in the end prevent intelligent design from receiving a fair hearing. The subtitle of Richard Dawkins's The Blind Watchmaker reads Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe with#out Design. Dawkins may be right that design is absent from the universe. But science needs to address not only the evidence that reveals the universe to be without design but also the evidence that reveals the universe to be with design. Evidence is a two&#8209;edged sword: claims capable of being refuted by evidence are also capable of being supported by evidence. Even if design ends up being rejected as an unfruitful explanatory tool for science, such a negative outcome for design needs to result from the evidence for and against design being fairly considered. Darwin himself would have agreed: \"A fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question.\"\" Consequently, any rejection of design must not result from imposing arbitrary constraints on science that rule out design prior to any consideration of evidence. \n\n \n \n \nMind you, science doesn't try to do so. \n\n \n Posters on forums like these, talkorigins, Richard Dawkins, countless other sources do it all the time.\n \n \n \nThis looks like a rewording of the God of the Gaps fallacy, complete with marc's habitual labeling of science as \"atheistic.\" \n\n \n 90% of those who represent it, see above.\n \n \n \nHe didn't.

My point was that they looked into alleged examples of irreducible complexity and found them not to be irreducibly complex. Simple as. Every bit of evidence ID comes up with is shown to be flawed when properly investigated. \n \n \nWhen a hint of worldviews / entertainment are involved, a substantial body of money is involved.\n\n \n Again, no idea what you actually mean by this.\n \n \nThere seems to be disagreement among atheist science about that, according to what I've seen on these forums. Many atheists seem to believe that we can only work back to a certain point, that some things are beyond human understanding.\n\n \n No, again you've missed the point entirely. Anyone with any beliefs can think that some things are beyond human understanding. My point was that science in itself, as a pure philosophy, will not accept that anything is unknowable. The only exceptions are things that cannot be tested for, which are assumed not to exist. There is no point arguing about that last sentence by the way, because we will just go round and round with you saying \"I believe in God\" and me saying \"I assume he doesn't exist\" because that's how I see things.\n \n \nWorldview bias, combined with money and entertainment value - no, I can't see it.\n\n \n What is this entertainment value you keep mentioning? What do you mean and how does it relate to anything we're talking about? \n \n \nScience can't offer an alternative to faith for two reasons IMO;\n \n 1) Science isn't the only source of knowledge.\n 2) Atheist science has too many gaps to consider itself to be above faith.\n\n \n 1) It's the only source of verifiable knowledge\n 2) There is no such thing as \"atheist science\". Gaps are to be expected and investigated as I explained, and faith is, from science's point of view, one big gap. That's the problem. \n \n \nIt won't scrap Darwinism, no matter what. If Darwin would have realized that the universe wasn't eternal (that it had a beginning) or if he would have had any idea of the complexity of cells, he would have probably scrapped it, if he didn't care about entertainment & money.\n\n \n ?????????Lost for words, this has already been answered anyway.\n \n \nAnd a basic new one is ID. In the U.S. we try to answer new ones by politically blocking thought about them in school classrooms.\n\n \n But ID has no answers that haven't been shown to be a load of cack.\n \n \nI don't mind your saying that part at all, because it's true. But science hasn't done it alone - the atheist worldview has helped it a lot. Funny how the Bible never clearly says that the sun goes around the earth. The Bible never clearly says anything that controdicts anything that science has discovered. If it seems to, it's only because the Bible is being metaphoric. It's purpose is to instruct us how to behave much more than entertain us with facts about astronomy.\n\n \n Well my point was more that science has helped people to question age old repressive dogmas and actually think for themselves, we don't need an old book to tell us how to behave.\n \n \nIf only it were that simple. A supernatural cause is far from being the only thing that is meaningless to the scientific method. Things like morality, tradition, and many other important, useful things are also meaningless to the scientific method.\n\n \n Morality is meaningless only in terms of the pure ideology of the scientific method. When it comes to people, scientists and priests alike can be good or evil, ethical or unethical. \n Tradition is neither important or useful in the quest for knowledge and should be treated with suspicion.\n \n \n\"Picking holes in unfinished areas of the theory\"?? Like the picking of holes in ID?? Picking holes can be a disproportionately large element of atheist science too. Again, it goes both ways.\n\n \n ID has not had holes picked in it because it does not even have a framework in which to pick holes, because every attempt to set one up is shown to be flawed, or dishonest, or based on ignorance by people who, no matter what you think, really do know what they are talking about because they have studied for years and seen experimental results first-hand.",

I don't need to argue sensibly against this because you have nothing with which to back it up. \n\n \n It's supported - there is plenty of recent U.S. history to back it up. Belief in God is fading in the U.S. and the size of the federal government is increasing. \n It largely goes back to the Biblical assertion that every person inherits a natural, sinful nature. When one person does believe that, and another person doesn't believe that, their values and practices quickly take different paths. One brief example - if two different people (one religious and one non religious) have a child with a behavior problem, chances are they will choose two different paths to correct it. The religious one will choose dicipline, using Biblical guidelines, to adjust the attitude of their \"naturally sinful\" child. The non religious one, with no admission of sin, may diagnose the problem as \"attention deficit disorder\", a medical condition. They would then seek medication for it, at the profit of the scientific community, and at the expence of society. They have insurance you know. The term \"attention deficit disorder\" would have been an absolute joke in the U.S. just a few decades ago. The scientific community has changed all that now. \n \n \n \nYour example, Sagan's Cosmos, is one of the best-researched and well-written, factually accurate layman's science productions in history. I have the book, and at no point does he say anything about the existence or non-existence of God. \n\n \n I don't have the book, but your review seems to clash with other reviews.\n \n \n Roger McEvilly\n One can see his strong leanings on the likelihood of extraterrestial life and the SETI project between the lines, as well as his views on religion and its place in the human psyche. One particularly interesting peice describes the downfall of the old greek science and the destruction of the library at Alexandria, and how these tie in with his views on history, science and religion in general. \n\n \n amazon\n \n \"Between the lines\" is the key phrase. Sagan, and much of todays science, can masterfully perpetuate a supremacy of science over religion.\n \n \n \nNo it doesn't, because religion is by definition based on faith, \n\n \n Religion is based on a lot more than that. Let's look at the definition;\n \n dictionary.com\n \n1)a)Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. \n b)A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. \n 2)The life or condition of a person in a religious order. \n 3)A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. \n A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. \n\n \n As number 3 says, it also involves values and practices.\n \n \n \n \n \nand science by definition is based on theories that can most accurately predict physical phenomena. I really don't know what you'reon about when you talk about \"advocating a set of principles\" because Sagan and Dawkins most definitely have nothing to say about principles or morality. They do not have \"beliefs\", they are atheists.\n\n \n Atheism is a belief. Dawkins has plenty to say about principles and morality.\n \n \n Wikipedia \n \nIn January 2006, Dawkins presented a two-part Channel 4 documentary entitled The Root of All Evil?, addressing what he sees as the malignant influence of organised religion in society. \n\n \n \n \nThis is another sweeping statement which I just cannot reply to because I don't know what you're trying to say. \n\n \n I can't make it any clearer. Science sells, it entertains, it's political when it comes to medicine and other things, and it can oppose traditional morals. \n \n \n \n \n \nNo, that kind of thinking is science. And it's not political. And I have no idea what the last sentence means.\n\n \n If atheist philosophy is science, then ID philosophy should be also. There is a double standard. My last sentence \"Funding tends to stop when science limits itself to actual science.\" means this; Funding science is political. The actual material study of science can be more boring to the general public than philosophical, \"cosmos\" type of science.\n \n \n \n \n \nScience isn't trying to \"prove that wrong\", that's my whole point. Science just assumes that it's wrong in order to go about its scientific business but actually trying to prove it is obviously impossible and irrelevant.\n\n \n Many in science claim that nothing is beyond human understanding. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen I said 'verifiable knowledge', I meant just that: verifiable knowledge.

Which is worse: that you actually believe we're that stupid, or that the people you think are that stupid are refuting your points with ease?\n \n \nI don't have the book, but your review seems to clash with other reviews.\n\n So you look through reviews submitted by (non-professional) reviewers on amazon.com and find a single one that explains that Sagan's religious views are indirectly discernible via his statements, and take that to mean that the book is necessarily anti-theistic? What are you on, anyway?\n \n \nReligion is based on a lot more than that. Let's look at the definition;\n \n dictionary.com\n \n\n 1)a)Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe.\n b)A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship.\n 2)The life or condition of a person in a religious order.\n 3)A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader.\n A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.\n\n \n As number 3 says, it also involves values and practices.\n\n So if my value system tells me it's wrong to kill, that's part of my religion?!\n Reductio ad absurdum hurts, doesn't it?\n \n \nDawkins has plenty to say about principles and morality.\n \n \n Wikipedia\n \nIn January 2006, Dawkins presented a two-part Channel 4 documentary entitled The Root of All Evil?, addressing what he sees as the malignant influence of organised religion in society.\n\n\n Have you seen the documentary? If so, please list five major points with which you disagree.\n \n \nScience sells, it entertains, it's political when it comes to medicine and other things, and it can oppose traditional morals.\n\n You say these things as if they're bad, and yet religion does the very same things.\n But of course, who cares if morals are traditional? I care if they're actually moral, and many \"traditional morals\" really aren't.\n \n \nIf atheist philosophy is science, then ID philosophy should be also.\n\n You still have failed to support your assertion that science or evolution is atheistic.\n \n \nThere is a double standard.\n\n You think there is only because you don't understand that science is secular. You also don't understand ID \"philosophy.\"\n \n \nMy last sentence \"Funding tends to stop when science limits itself to actual science.\" means this; Funding science is political. The actual material study of science can be more boring to the general public than philosophical, \"cosmos\" type of science.\n\n I have refuted this line of argumentation in a previous post. I can only wonder why you chose to continue it.\n \n \nMany in science claim that nothing is beyond human understanding.\n\n As one \"in science,\" I can confidently say that marc9000 elegantly demonstrates that the limits of human understanding depend largely upon the human.",

   "When I said 'verifiable knowledge', I meant just that: verifiable knowledge. Morality, love, social problems etc are not as simple as that. This goes without saying. What's your point? \n\n \n \"Verifiable knowledge\" is often used as a tool to make a political decision that involves social problems that aren't as simple as that. Abortion decisions, medication decisions, life or death decisions, endangered species decisions, environmental decisions, etc. That is my point.\n \n \n \nYou seem to be looking for a reason behind all the ills of the world, and because some well-supported theories contradict some of your beliefs you have settled on science as your bete noir. \n\n \n Science is not my bete noir. Atheists who use certain paths of science as a political tool is my bete noir. Let's look at American Atheists explanation of their scientific symbol;\n \n \nYou may notice that one of the orbital in our symbol is broken, or open-ended. This demonstrates that while Atheists rely on the scientific method for learning about the cosmos and increasing our knowledge about nature, we know that \"not all of the answers are in.\" We recognize that with new knowledge come new questions and areas for human inquiry and exploration. \n \n \n http://www.atheists.org/visitors.center/logo.html\n \n It sounds innocent - they want to learn about the cosmos and increase their knowledge. But when we check their homepage, the innocence tends to disapear. Here's a brief list of what's on their homepage;\n \n Pope JP 2,\n Federal judge...suit...In God we trust,\n The number 666,\n Gay marriage,\n Pat Robertson,\n Christian cross at WTC site,\n Ann Coulter\n \n Are they really all that focused on the cosmos?\n \n \nJust some alternative causes of problems: the legacy of centuries of war, the injustices perpetrated in the name of capitalism, the wealth gap also caused by the pursuit of capitalism, the burgeoning problems of overpopulation (particluarly concentrations in cities), pollution, deforestation...\n\n \n Could it be that these things could stem from things like \"bitterness, rage, anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice\"? They're less likely to come from \"whatever is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, praisworthy\", aren't they? When the American Atheists look to certain paths of science, what incentive do they have to take into account the above Biblical terms that are not as verifiable and simple as their brand of science?\n \n \nAll these things (and more) have multiple and complex ramifications which affect people collectively and personally, and cause social and psychological problems. To blame it all on the abstract notion of 'science' is utterly ridiculous.\n\n \n I don't blame it all on any one thing. But atheism's abstract notion of science doesn't help, when it tries to circumvent proper political processes.",

Which is worse: that you actually believe we're that stupid, or that the people you think are that stupid are refuting your points with ease? \n\n \n My assertion is common sense really, but all one has to do is compare a few Christian creeds with something like the humanist manefesto, for example. \n \n \"Refuting my points with ease\" - you sure are brimming with confidence in judging your own debates, I'll give you that. You may be having problems with the word \"refute\" however. It doesn't mean \"to counter one opinion with one's own opinion.\" That's not a refutation. You'll find an actual refutation in post #70, of this statement by you;\n \n \nFurthermore, your claim is incorrect. The floor did not \"become the base.\" \n\n \n Please give an example where you \"refuted\" me in a similar manner. \n \n \n \nSo you look through reviews submitted by (non-professional) reviewers on amazon.com and find a single one that explains that Sagan's religious views are indirectly discernible via his statements, and take that to mean that the book is necessarily anti-theistic?

I care if they're actually moral, and many \"traditional morals\" really aren't. \n\n \n That would be according to ones worldview.

You also don't understand ID \"philosophy.\" \n\n \n Designed systems are secular. There is much that you don't understand.\n \n \n \nI have refuted this line of argumentation in a previous post.

Don't you see how this works?\n \n \nAnd some shocking news for you; politics is seldom about truth, it's about worldviews!!\n\n I'm not talking about politics, I'm talking about reality. One person's wacky views don't alter what is true about the subject matter.\n \n \nBelief in God is fading in the U.S. and the size of the federal government is increasing.\nWhat, are these two things related, or are you just on your soapbox again?\n\n \nThey are related, yes. You should check through some U.S. court decisions and political history in the last 50 or 100 years.\n\n Please analyze the causal relationships between these two issues, citing specific examples.\n \n \nMy assertion is common sense really,\n\n Well, perhaps you'd like to think it's common sense, but you've revealed that your idea of \"common sense\" isn't very sensical.\n \n \n\"Refuting my points with ease\" - you sure are brimming with confidence in judging your own debates, I'll give you that.\n\n When my debate opponent is arguing that non-Christian, practicing Buddhists are opposed to discipline, need I do any more than simply point this out?\n \n \nPlease give an example where you \"refuted\" me in a similar manner. \n\n Oh, I dunno, perhaps the entire exchange concerning the second law of thermodynamics?\n \n \nThat \"single one\" reflected the views of many on that series.\n\n So it's your position that not just this one average guy, but many people thought that Sagan's views were indirectly discernible based on his statements? That is, that he never actually came out and said it, but only implied it in a very roundabout manner? Do the other reviews make the same statements?\n \n \nI'm not \"on\" anything - I'm not advocating an agreement with science on every medication that comes down the pike for behavior adjustment.\n\n But we're not discussing \"behavior adjustment,\" we're discussing evolution. You're the one who brought up ADD in a completely tangential and totally indefensible \"example.\"\n \n \nIt hurts you, yes.\n\n Where have you reduced any of my arguments to absurdity?\n \n \nKilling is a microscopic part of an overall system of values and practices.\n\n Yet it is a part, and that's all I need to make my point. \n \n \nIt's so silly it's not worth my time.\n\n T.Q already has you dead to rights on this one.\n \n \nReligion doesn't oppose traditional morals to near the same extent, and religion isn't nearly as publicly established and funded as science is in the U.S.\n\n Of course religion doesn't \"oppose traditional morals\"; religion is what established them. Let us note, though, that you opted not to respond to my comment that \"traditional morals\" are not really all that moral (e.g. selling a daughter into slavery, stoning a person for working on the sabbath). However, I would really like you to support your second statement: I'd like to know how much money flows into religious institutions, and how many of those institutions there are in the United States, constrasted with the amount of funding for scientific programs, and how many scientific research institutions there are in the United States. I do happen to know that there are over 20,000 churches in my region, yet we have only a handful of research institutions.\n \n \nYours happens to be in the minority in the U.S.\n\n Which is of course not a refutation of my point in the slightest.\n \n \nSee my copy/paste above to Liminus, concerning the American Atheists symbol.\n\n Righto, marc. As I said earlier, you make some pretty lousy arguments, but this one ranks pretty high. Instead of pointing to a scientific organization's endorsement of atheism, you point at an atheists' organization endorsement of science to \"show\" that science is atheistic. It might carry more weight the other way around, but here's how your argument plays out:\n \n American Atheists support science.\n American Atheists is an atheistic organization.\n Therefore, science is atheistic.\n \n But this can be reduced to absurdity, based merely upon the existence of Kenneth Miller's book:\n \n Kenneth Miller supports science.\n Kenneth Miller is a Christian.\n Therefore, science is Christian.\n \n Or, just to spite your insistence that Miller is a phony, I could use the ASA:\n \n The ASA supports science.\n The ASA is a Christian organization.\n Therefore, science is Christian.\n \n Your argument fails. Spectacularly.\n Or are you going to call the entire ASA phonies, too?\n \n \nDesigned systems are secular. There is much that you don't understand.\n\n I'll argue this point only after you show definitively that any biological system is designed.\n \n \nThat was the post where you referred to increasing shelf life of medicines for the benifit of mankind. Alllllll those medicines that we need to cover up our misunderstanding of humans being born sinful creatures. Cosmos science lovers can perk up about the boring stuff when it can pacify their undiciplined children so they can go to the casinos.\n\n Wait, you're saying that every disease on earth is due to mankind's sinful nature?\n What about my friend's research in organic chemistry? Learning how to make cool molecules like polymeric plastics is to make up for mankind's sinful nature too?\n \n This is the point where any lurkers harboring doubts should be crystal clear.\n \n \nSince you're \"in science\", have you ever heard of the Biological Science Cirriculum Study? (BSCS) That's part of U.S. political / science history of the past 50 years that I referred to above.\n\n Oh, so you're opposed to teaching schoolchildren about science? Make up your mind...\n \n \nThe three things I named were time proven to a comparable extent that atheism is a well supported theory.\n\n Atheism is not a \"well supported [scientific] theory.\" We're talking science, here, and science isn't atheism. Nor is atheism science. Atheism isn't a \"theory\" at all. Whether atheism is well-supported is a different issue.\n \n \nBut I wonder if Liminus needs your help as badly as you think he does.\n\n I'm sure Liminus doesn't need my help; all it takes is a functional brain and some background education to discredit your arguments.\n \n \nI know your stance on how you judge your own debates, and on your assumptions on why I my not respond immediately or at all. Perhaps you don't know my stance on how much time I have to spend on you. I do have a life. I can sometimes set aside a few hours in an evening just for you.\n\n Aw, I'm so hurt... I have to try hard to make time in my busy schedule to roast the daylights out of you, and you don't even do the same for me?\n \n \n \nI was referring to teachers that claim to be theistic evolutionists - they claim to be Christians, yet teach evolution in perfect lockstep with atheists.\n\n Yeah, we've really got to crack down on those alleged \"theist\" teachers who promote that evil atomic theory in perfect lockstep with atheists. And why stop there?! Let's kick out every teacher who teaches that the earth revolves around the sun in perfect lockstep with atheists! This must be stopped!!\n The argument is so stupid, it hurts.\n \n \nAs I said before, designed systems are scientific.\n\n Remind me not to let you get away with such a vague statement.\n \n \nThe judge not only ruled in the minority's favor, he ordered the school board to pay the plantiff's legal fees, which will probably exceed $1 million.\n\n The judge ruled according to the law, and you should be damn glad he did. You'd be screwed without the First Amendment.\n Furthermore, it isn't uncommon for the losing party to be responsible for legal fees. For example, if I take a baseball bat to your vehicle, and you take me to court and win, why should you have to pay the legal fees incurred to find me guilty?\n If the school board hadn't been undeniably guilty (and by undeniably, I do mean it, as two board members perjured themselves), they wouldn't have had to pay. It's as simple as that. It really sends a good message: don't break the law.\n I'll also point out once again that Judge Jones is a self-professed Lutheran appointed by Bush II. marc still denies this, of course, because he apparently doesn't think Christians should care about the law instead of their religion.\n \n \nHow many school districts do you think will carry out the wishes of the majority if it could very well mean being bankrupted by the ACLU?\n\n We've already discussed that a minority view isn't necessarily wrong solely because it is a minority view, nor is a majority view necessarily right. Reality is reality regardless of viewpoint or popularity.\n \n \nWhy should the majority religion in the U.S. pay for atheist propaganda disguised as science?\n\n They shouldn't! But, then, where is the atheist propaganda? You keep making the assertion, but you have been utterly unable to support it.\n On the other hand, ID and creationism are very much theist propaganda, so why should anybody pay for it? Why should anybody be forced to learn it? Why should anybody promote false assertions? (Oh wait, I guess I'm asking the wrong person here, aren't I?)\n \n \nThere is a difference between antibiotics and unnecessary use of psyco medications.\n\n You had no problem bashing my prior project in a previous post. I guess you're just selectively applying your beliefs again.\n \n \nI'm against children being exposed to rot gut porn, yes. It tends to increase ADD, and the medication that goes with it.\n\n Support your assertion.\n \n \nHe couldn't do anything about the Dover case, could he?\n\n You're right: he appointed a right-leaning, non-activist, religious conservative to the district in question, and even that judge realized that ID is total horse manure. Bush II couldn't have done a damn thing.\n Not that your response refutes T.Q's point...\n \n \n \nTheistic evolutionists like Kenneth Miller are often embraced by those who oppose traditional Christian values. \n\n And there was nothing but hate from Christians for a certain theistic evolutionist who went by \"The Bishop of Rome,\" wasn't there?\n \n \nWhy do some Christians get so nervous over scientific guesses about what happened hundreds of trillions of centuries ago?\n\n Please give an example of a \"scientific guess\" about what happened \"hundreds of trillions of centuries ago.\"\n The reason Christians get so nervous about scientific findings about the distant past is precisely because they are not \"guesses,\" and they turn the dogma of the church upside down to the point of uselessness.

It appears that theistic evolutionists also believe there was no flood. Let's look at a prophesy in Matthew 24; 36 - 39.\n \n \n \nNo one knows about that day or hour, (when Jesus will return) not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the arc, and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. \n\n \n If this prophesy is a comparison of a real historical event, I think the warning is much more significant than if the flood was simply a figurative story. If the flood was figurative, would it also not be pretty easy for a theistic evolutionist to believe the future coming of Jesus is also figurative? \n \n \n There are some passages that NEED to be taken literally, and some that NEED to be taken figuratively. The whole thing doesn't have to be taken literally. I think God intended the Bible to be taken figuratively in places. \n\n \n I do too, (Jesus parables, for example) but not in clearly described parts of Genesis. \n \n \n \nNo problem. But it sounds like you're the one getting nervous about scientific guesses, given that you refuse to accept the evidence. I just don't see what the incompatibility is here.\n\n \n Do you not see incompatibility in the opposing beliefs concerning the flood? The references made to it in the Bible that concern two very important things - how we should behave, and what the future holds?\n \n I get nervous because it appears that science follows very narrow paths to find only \"evidence\" that it wants to find, in a top-down manner. Starting with a conclusion, then building evidence for it. The knee jerk critisisms of irreducible complexity for example. Science is vehement in it's references to the Genesis flood, because it causes problems for what they want the fossil record to say. Darwinism is their conclusion, and it doesn't matter what new discoveries say that Darwin couldn't have known about. There is a reason they are terrified at the thought of ID being explored to the same extent as evolution. \n \n No time tonight, but tomorrow evening or over the weekend, I'll expore some history of the BSCS, (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study) and you'll see some more things that make me nervous. emoticon_xangel",

   "Here is a list of Christian Clergy that is fighting the Fundamentalist anti-intellectualism and quite plainly accepting the fact that the theory of evolution has massive amounts of evidence for it.\n Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible - the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark - convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.\n \n We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as \"one theory among others\" is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.\n \n from http://www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/religion_science_collaboration.htm\n \n \n \n Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter.\n\n \n Foolish Clergymen.\n How can this work? How can you take something as serious as the supposed Holy word of God and say that? I mean if you cant take something as simple as what is said in genesis and beleive it then why the XXXX would people beleive in anything else the bible has to say? If there is falsehood in it then how can any of it be trusted? If the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark are just there to serve as the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. That is Absolutly ridiculous. Why stop with that? Why not continue on to say that the story of Jesus was jsut a way for man to relate to God? Oh but then it continues doesnt it? Yes it does! Nothing in the bible is to be beleived unless it is all beleived as a whole. It is torn apart. \n \n You cannot pick and choose parts of this religion as it fits your needs.

Non originalism goes along with an increase in the size of domestic government, while originalism tends to limit it. Carl Sagan, the New York Times, CNN, Air America Radio, report and editoralize with a non originalist slant, and they have non Christian ownership/management. Conservative news/talk sources and pro-family organizations tend to have an originalist viewpoint, and their management is Christian/creation. There really is a pattern.\n \n \n \nWhen my debate opponent is arguing that non-Christian, practicing Buddhists are opposed to discipline, need I do any more than simply point this out? \n\n \n Where did I say anything about Buddhists? emoticon_confused \n \n \n \nOh, I dunno, perhaps the entire exchange concerning the second law of thermodynamics? \n\n \n You're right, you dunno, because you didn't do too well in that one. You never were able to come up with a mechanism for evolution, that was equal to your example in thermodynamics, the refrigerator. Photosynthesis comes up short in combining sufficient increases in order, and sufficient protection from the elements that cause the 2nd Law to be so predictable and far reaching.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by marc9000\n It's so silly it's not worth my time. \n \n [electrolyte]T.Q already has you dead to rights on this one. \n\n \n T.Q. never addressed that line. Buddhists, germ theories, what do you do, pull this stuff out of thin air hoping no one will go back a few posts and check it out?? You seem like a very eccentric scientist. :p \n \n \n \nOf course religion doesn't \"oppose traditional morals\"; religion is what established them. Let us note, though, that you opted not to respond to my comment that \"traditional morals\" are not really all that moral (e.g. selling a daughter into slavery, stoning a person for working on the sabbath). However, I would really like you to support your second statement: I'd like to know how much money flows into religious institutions, and how many of those institutions there are in the United States, constrasted with the amount of funding for scientific programs, and how many scientific research institutions there are in the United States. I do happen to know that there are over 20,000 churches in my region, yet we have only a handful of research institutions. \n\n \n PUBLICLY established and funded. Religious institutions are on private property, voluntarily/privately funded, similar to any business. Not comparable to public, taxpayer funding for science. \n \n \n \n \nRighto, marc. As I said earlier, you make some pretty lousy arguments, but this one ranks pretty high. Instead of pointing to a scientific organization's endorsement of atheism, \n\n \n I do it all the time, it's called talkorigins. emoticon_idea \n \n \nyou point at an atheists' organization endorsement of science to \"show\" that science is atheistic. It might carry more weight the other way around, but here's how your argument plays out:\n \n American Atheists support science.\n American Atheists is an atheistic organization.\n Therefore, science is atheistic.\n \n But this can be reduced to absurdity, based merely upon the existence of Kenneth Miller's book:\n \n Kenneth Miller supports science.\n Kenneth Miller is a Christian.\n Therefore, science is Christian.\n \n Or, just to spite your insistence that Miller is a phony, I could use the ASA:\n \n The ASA supports science.\n The ASA is a Christian organization.\n Therefore, science is Christian.\n \n Your argument fails. Spectacularly.\n Or are you going to call the entire ASA phonies, too? \n\n \n American Atheists, Kenneth Miller, and the ASA, all support science, certain paths of science that they choose to explore, and sometimes draw different philosophical conclusions from the same scientific paths. They all trumpet \"science\" in their own way. Science \"IS\" the path that is chosen for it, often by politics. Your word games didn't work.\n \n \nI'll argue this point only after you show definitively that any biological system is designed. \n\n \n As soon as you definitively show that it's mathematically possible for all 30 parts of the bacterial flafellum, or 200 parts of the cilium to come together by numerous, successive, slight modifications of \"natural selection\". \n \n \nOriginally Posted by marc9000\n Since you're \"in science\", have you ever heard of the Biological Science Cirriculum Study? (BSCS) That's part of U.S. political / science history of the past 50 years that I referred to above. \n \n \n [electrolyte]Oh, so you're opposed to teaching schoolchildren about science? Make up your mind...\n\n \n Science was being studied, and taught, (successfully) long before the BSCS came into existance. emoticon_idea \n \n In the 1950's, chemistry and physics were the branches of science that were getting most of the government funding, and biologists were feeling lonely. A small handfull of them got the bright idea of making biology less boring by combining it with philosophical evolution. From the BSCS homepage;\n \n \nBSCS is a leader in the field of science education because of our support for the teaching of evolution, our comprehensive approach to improved science teaching and learning, and our development and implementation of the BSCS 5E Instructional Model. \n\n \n http://www.bscs.org/page.asp?pageid=0|2\n \n \n Quick searches of it's founders on any search engine will show you what their hobbies were, evolution! (Bentley Glass, Herman J. Muller, John Moore) They figured that old fashioned local school boards didn't know quite as much about educating students as a proper federal government agency. Founded in 1958, it hit the ground running with it's federal funding. By 1963, it's array of biology textbooks emphasized evolution in sharp contrast to earlier textbooks less than 10 years old. John Moore headed the committee of the content of the curriculum, and he showed a personal hostility to the Judeo Christian religion. By 1968, Bentley Glass was giving speeches about the \"social\" aspects of biological education, suggesting that students evaluate their genotype, and reevaluate the right of certain parents to produce children. And Darwinists continue to shut their eyes, hold their ears, and scream that \"science\" isn't political. \n \n \n \nI'm sure Liminus doesn't need my help; all it takes is a functional brain and some background education to discredit your arguments. \n\n \n He doesn't need your help, yet you're quick to give it? Your eccentricity is showing again.\n \n \n \n \nThe reason Christians get so nervous about scientific findings about the distant past is precisely because they are not \"guesses,\" and they turn the dogma of the church upside down to the point of uselessness. Regarding the Genesis story, disproving the tale of Adam and Eve would disprove the whole idea of \"original sin\" and the tree of knowledge, not to mention Atonement theory (which falls apart all on its own anyway) and the alleged purpose in Jesus's death. And marc claims that evolutionists are the ones in denial because they have so much to lose...\n\n \n Thank you very much, that proves my point about science having political and religious motivations.",

LOL I wish I recieved as many \"pleas\" here as I do insults. But it's fun. \n \n Trueorigins does a good job of briefly exposing talkorigins;\n \n \nEssentially then, TO is a propaganda machine for philosophical naturalism using the more acceptable and palatable cover of methodological naturalism. Evolution theory is nothing but the scientific operational model to support this metaphysical position. \n TO attempts to cover this point by stating that in their group they also have Christian and other religious evolutionists-people that believe in God, believe in a creation by a deity, but also believe in evolution (i.e., middle-grounders). TO employs this strategy to give its visitors a sense of universal appeal, i.e. that anyone, regardless of their beliefs, may subscribe to evolution. But again, exactly what evolution are they referring to? The one that says \"things change\" (this is science), or the one that says \"that's how everything came to be\" (this transcends science and is philosophical naturalism-a metaphysical position)? TO uses the two interchangeably. \n \n Yet, anyone who knows the score realizes that middle-grounders are at best marginally tolerated by 'pure-blood' naturalists-as these say, \"the hypothesis of God is unnecessary!\" Why, then, do the pure-bloods tolerate these naturalistic 'misfits'? There are probably many answers to this question but two are worth briefly mentioning: 'divide and conquer' and 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend.' Thus, naturalists welcome whatever sows dissension among creationists and, therefore, anyone disagreeing with the fundamentalist Christian position in any way while accepting any part of the evolutionary doctrine is embraced by them (at least for now). \n \n The focus of this article is on those deceptions invoked by the TO writers, which are mostly achieved by omissions, as is demonstrated in the illustrations below. It is often what the people at TO do not say that makes TO a propaganda/indoctrination site as opposed to an educational site. \n\n \n http://www.trueorigin.org/to_deception.asp\n \n \n \n \nThis doesn't at all show how \"[my] word games didn't work.\" Quite the contrary actually; you weren't able to counter my reductio ab adsurdum. \n\n \n They showed it all that was necessary. To further show it, when you use a \"if A is true, and B is true, then C is true; it has to indisputable that both A and B are true. To say Kenneth Miller is a Christian, is debatable. There is simply nothing to stop an atheist from claiming to be a Christian, if he thinks it will acheive a certain goal. \n \n \n \nI can show (and have showed) that irreducibly complex systems have evolved, and that refutes your claim. (In fact, when I did, you initiated an accusation of \"conspiracy\" of a sort instead of even attempting to counter.)\n\n \n Your \"refutation\" was vague to say the least. \n \n \n \nI could link you to Matzke's paper on a mathematically possible evolutionary pathway leading to the bacterial flagellum, but you wouldn't read it and you would dismiss it in your normal bout of frantic handwaving. \n\n \n Why didn't you link it? Is it hundreds of pages long? Evolutionists always claim that irreduceable complexity is disproven, but never seem to be able to clearly show it. Can evolutionlists come up with a simple example, (like Behe's mousetrap) to show the \"lock & key\" steps etc, to make it really believable that complex organisms can evolve with no intelligence involved? Why don't you condense Matzke's paper into a few concise paragraphs and post it here? Complete with mathematical probabilities of course. \n \n \nYou once again display your ignorance of evolutionary mechanisms by ignoring processes such as exaptation and scaffolding; you instead expect me to show that any given example of evolution works by natural selection alone. This is, of course, ridiculous.\n\n \n Then you could include further mathematical probabilities of all these things coming together in perfect order, without the second law of thermodynamics causing any problems.\n \n \nDid I say or even imply the opposite? No, I didn't.

Starting with a conclusion, then building evidence for it. The knee jerk critisisms of irreducible complexity for example. Science is vehement in it's references to the Genesis flood, because it causes problems for what they want the fossil record to say. Darwinism is their conclusion, and it doesn't matter what new discoveries say that Darwin couldn't have known about. There is a reason they are terrified at the thought of ID being explored to the same extent as evolution. \n\n \n You're close marc. I take it you've never been taught the scientic method (I'm making an assumption based on you poor understanding of it).\n \n Here's the crash course for you -\n \n That conclusion is called a hypothesis.\n \n First, a hypothesis is formed, that hypothesis is then tested to determine it's validity. If the hypothesis is proven incorrect by the testing, it is thrown out, and a new hypothesis is formed based on the tests and the data. The new hypothesis is then further tested to determine its validity.\n \n I get a kick out of the fact that people claim that \"if we only gave ID a chance\" it would be every bit is as valid. It's ridiculous and delusional. You can explore ID all you want, it won't change a thing.

Much of what goes on in medicine today is due to man's sinful nature however, it's a big part of medical cost problems.\n\n Then you weren't very clear. Regardless, you have now twice failed to respond to my examples of non-issues in science which you insist do not exist.\n \n \nYes I did - you would have recognized it if you knew anything about U.S. court decisions and political history in the last 50 or 100 years.\n\n No, I explicity asked for causal relationships, and you showed only an alleged correlation. This is like saying that FSMism is true because of the number of pirates in the world.\n \n \nBuddhists are atheists - theists are evolutionists - some evolutionists are Christians - some evolutionists are humanists - it all gets very confusing except for one thing, EVERYBODY is right as long as they're not a creationist!!\n\n No, other people can be wrong, too; the fact that I've repeatedly shown you to be wrong only means that you give me so much fodder.\n \n \nAny opponent you get here will be guilty of that, it's clear that you'll never give anyone else the last word. All threads have to stop sometime.\n\n Your excuse was that the thread had not stopped and had instead gone on to other topics. However, it had not, as I posted a response to you concerning the second law of thermodynamics as you were active on other threads. You simply chose not to respond because your talking points had been demolished.\n \n \nMaybe because they weren't applicable to my objections.\n\n They were exactly what you asked for, but you refused to pay any attention to them. You asked for a biological equivalent of the refrigerator (i.e. something that takes incoming energy and uses it to locally reduce entropy) and I provided what you were looking for: photosystems. In fact, readers can go back and look for themselves to see just how full of rubbish you are.\n \n \nThe discussion concerned the comparison of the second law with evolution, because they are comparable. They both concern the process of change, and they both happen on the same planet, same environment, same temperatures, under the same sun. \n\n No, the discussion concerned the limitations imposed by the second law of thermodynamics on the process of evolution. A \"comparison\" is a disanalogy because while evolution is a process, the second law of thermodynamics is not. Now you are trying to spin the post-roasting discussion by mislabeling the topics. In fact, someone (pandion?) showed that your \"comparison\" is ridiculous because then the second law of thermodynamics would apply to his changing clothes. You, of course, had no response.\n \n \nThe same way you are incapable of understanding my points about public funding vs. private funding?\n\n I understand the difference between the two, but when we look at what you actually wrote, with original emphasis:\n \nReligion doesn't oppose traditional morals to near the same extent, and religion isn't nearly as publicly established and funded as science is in the U.S.\n\n it is easy to see why I discussed establishment and funding, only to have you retort:\nPUBLICLY established and funded.\n\n At which point you had completely skirted the original topic of how evil you insist science is and condemn it based not on science itself but on its status as being publicly funded. So science is evil because it's publicly funded. Gotcha.\n \n \n \nYou're mistaken!! Next time you analyze ~my~ reading comprension, I'll copy paste yours in black & white.\n\n How about I beat you to the punch?\nI haven't seen it - I'm sure it mirrors this older piece of his.\n \n That \"single one\" reflected the views of many on that series.\n\n Wait, let me get this straight-you are criticizing a book and a documentary, blasting them for their \"atheism\", when you haven't read/seen either one? I actually just finished reading Cosmos, and found it quite surprising how often he referred to God and his creation in the course of the book. You may want to actually try reading a book before you criticize it.\n\n This is T.Q doing exactly what I said he did.\n \n \nWho is the ultimate authority on \"actual morality\"? It's a worldview - not the same as absolute truth.\n\n The question is not who is the ultimate authority, but how moral are \"traditional morals.\" That is to say, don't you support the death penalty for people who work on the sabbath and a father's right to sell his daughter into slavery? But I'll let you off the hook here, as this specific topic is really out of place in this forum.\n \n \nPrivate funding is not a concern of the establishment clause of the first amendment.\n\n I never said it was.\n It seems you are still working on your unsupported assertion that some part of science is religious. I'll ask for the umpteenth time, as this most certainly is the appropriate forum: Support your assertion.\n \n \nTrueorigins does a good job of briefly exposing talkorigins;\n\n Exposing talkorigins as what? An archive of scientific literature, exactly as I explained to you? Your citation does nothing but misrepresent the stance of the talkorigins authors, then argue against the strawman trueorigins has created. Furthermore, even your own citation does nothing to answer my challenge to you to support your assertion that evolution is atheistic.\n \n \nThey showed it all that was necessary. To further show it, when you use a \"if A is true, and B is true, then C is true; it has to indisputable that both A and B are true. To say Kenneth Miller is a Christian, is debatable. There is simply nothing to stop an atheist from claiming to be a Christian, if he thinks it will acheive a certain goal.\n\n In other words, you are basing your claim on yet another unfounded assertion that Miller is not a Christian. Well, support your assertion.\n Yet, this ridiculous behavior of yours has been so textbook that I specifically included a counter!\n \nBut this can be reduced to absurdity, based merely upon the existence of Kenneth Miller's book:\n \n Kenneth Miller supports science.\n Kenneth Miller is a Christian.\n Therefore, science is Christian.\n \n Or, just to spite your insistence that Miller is a phony, I could use the ASA:\n \n The ASA supports science.\n The ASA is a Christian organization.\n Therefore, science is Christian.\n \n Your argument fails. Spectacularly.\n Or are you going to call the entire ASA phonies, too?\n [emphasis added]\n\n So now you must show that both Miller and the entire ASA are phonies. Otherwise your assertion remains unsupported.\n \n \nYour \"refutation\" was vague to say the least. \n\n A hormone-receptor system that fits the criteria to be considered \"irreducibly complex\" evolved naturally. What's vague about that? Your refusing to understand it doesn't subtract any credibility from it.\n \n \nI could link you to Matzke's paper on a mathematically possible evolutionary pathway leading to the bacterial flagellum, but you wouldn't read it and you would dismiss it in your normal bout of frantic handwaving.\n\n Why didn't you link it?\n\n I think I already covered this: because you wouldn't read it and you would dismiss it in your normal bout of frantic handwaving.\n \n \nEvolutionists always claim that irreduceable complexity is disproven, but never seem to be able to clearly show it.\n\n Perhaps it's not \"clear\" to you, but you obviously have trouble understanding biochemistry and evolution. How much clearer can it get than \"here is an irreducibly complex system that evolved naturally\"?\n \n \nCan evolutionlists come up with a simple example, (like Behe's mousetrap) to show the \"lock & key\" steps etc, to make it really believable that complex organisms can evolve with no intelligence involved? Why don't you condense Matzke's paper into a few concise paragraphs and post it here? Complete with mathematical probabilities of course.\n\n We can come up with two: exaptation and scaffolding.\n Mathematical probabilities are not needed: in order to refute that claim that \"it is impossible for such a system to have evolved without intelligence,\" all that is required is that it is possible for any qualifying system to evolve. It is possible for irreducibly complex systems to evolve (e.g. hormone-receptor example above), so the claim is refuted.\n I predict a GotG tangent coming on...\n \n \nYes, you implied it. That wasn't an hom attack about the BSCS, that was actual history. (absolute truth) Can you refute any of it?\n\n No, I didn't imply it at all. And why would I refute the facts? They don't hurt my position at all. You're attacking it as if doing so helps your position, but it doesn't.\n \n \nIt requires multiple angles to \"roast\" ID, doesn't it?\n\n It's not that it requires multiple angles to roast ID, it's that ID is \"roastable\" from so many angles! It involves the fallacy of argument from incredulity, the fallacy of argument from improbability, the fallacy of argument from ignorance (including the \"God of the Gaps\" fallacy), it relies on falsehoods, it produces no useful information, it's not scientific, and ID as a whole is not falsifiable. I can falsify IC, I can falsify SC, but nobody can possibly falsify the assertion that, \"Somewhere, somehow, sometime, some intelligence did something.\" It's completely vacuous and utterly useless, which might explain why you like it so much...\n \n \nThose multiple angles wouldn't exist if ID was given an equal chance in schools, would it?\n\n All of the fallacies that ID commits would still be fallacies.\n \n \nYou stated that scientific findings are not guesses - that they have turned \"the dogma of the church upside down to the point of uselessness.\" Surely Kenneth Miller and the ASA accept these findings, right?\n\n I also stated that I don't know how these people resolve what I perceive to be major conflicts. I am not aware of all of the specific religious beliefs of Miller and the ASA.",

   "\"Atheistic\" science LOL, I love that one.\n \n But, don't forget \"theistic\" science.\n \n The simple fact is, SCIENCE, no modifier required, rejects a worldwide flood. \n\n \n Science is nothing but a tool - it can't reject anything. The imperfect humans who represent it can, but there's not a 100% agreement on the flood, by geologists and other scientists. It's simply not possible to prove prehistoric events.\n \n \n \nI'm amazed that no one has challenged you on this. \n\n \n Maybe because they know better than you just how GOOD I am. :p \n \n \nWhy is it more significant? Why is a specific, actual, physical flood more significant than a figurative flood, which would have the exact same consequences for Christians? \n\n \n Suppose there are weather reports predicting a hurricane. The people are told that it will be just as severe as an actual hurricane 10 years ago where many people (friends of friends / relatives of relatives) were killed and injured. Then suppose there was no hurricane 10 years ago, but they were told that it would be just as severe as the one in a recent Stephen King book. Which is going to get their attention more, the thought of reliving an actual hurricane, or being told that a Stephen King story is going to come to life? \n \n \n \nSecondly, it doesn't follow logically that becasue the flood story is figurative that Jesus' second coming is also therefore figurative. \n\n \n It may or may not follow logically, but it very well could follow in the minds of imperfect humans, especially if they are in the tender, worldview forming years of their youth.\n \n \n \n \nIt would seem to me that the problem lies in your understanding of the Bible. Neither of your two points is made invalid by the flood being figurative rather than an actual physical event.\n\n \n How about the Genesis account of Sodom and Gomorrah being destroyed. The rest of the history of the Old Testament. The authenticity of Psalms and Proverbs. Does it not matter to the importance of their teachings if they're real, or imagined by ONE writer?\n \n \n \n \nYou're close marc. I take it you've never been taught the scientic method (I'm making an assumption based on you poor understanding of it).\n\n \n No, I've never been taught the scientific method, (as in indoctrinated by one source) but I'm getting quite an education on these forums.\n \n \nHere's the crash course for you -\n \n That conclusion is called a hypothesis. \n\n \n Well let's just look up the word \"hypothesis\";\n \n \nhy\u00b7poth\u00b7e\u00b7sis ( P ) Pronunciation Key (h-pth-ss)\n n. pl. hy\u00b7poth\u00b7e\u00b7ses (-sz) \n A tentative explanation for an observation, phenomenon, or scientific problem that can be tested by further investigation. \n Something taken to be true for the purpose of argument or investigation; an assumption. The antecedent of a conditional statement. \n\n \n \n \nFirst, a hypothesis is formed, \n\n \n Yes, that fits, an assumption is made for the argument of atheism. \n \n \nthat hypothesis is then tested to determine it's validity. If the hypothesis is proven incorrect by the testing, it is thrown out, and a new hypothesis is formed based on the tests and the data. The new hypothesis is then further tested to determine its validity. \n\n \n Or, if it's proven incorrect by one method of testing, the hypothesis can be retained, and the method of testing thrown out, and a new avenues of testing can be tried and thrown out until one fits. It's been done with Darwinism more than once. \n \n \nI get a kick out of the fact that people claim that \"if we only gave ID a chance\" it would be every bit is as valid. It's ridiculous and delusional. You can explore ID all you want, it won't change a thing. Not becuase \"atheistic science\" is closed to the notion of ID, but because the data itself says that ID is invalid. \n\n \n Data is like science, it doesn't speak. Those who use it do the speaking. But I could possibly agree that the exploration of ID \"won't change a thing\", when it comes to scientific knowledge. Just like the exploration of philosophical evolution won't change a thing, when it comes to practical applications of science.",

You said this in your last post there;\n \n \nI have no idea what the main point of this passage is. \n\n \n This is your way of buying time when you're stumped, so you can ad hom and strawman anything I say in response to it. It was getting old. You're doing it here too, but I'm not ready to concede victory to you yet (har) there are still a few things to address.\n \n \n \n \nThey were exactly what you asked for, but you refused to pay any attention to them. You asked for a biological equivalent of the refrigerator (i.e. something that takes incoming energy and uses it to locally reduce entropy) and I provided what you were looking for: photosystems. In fact, readers can go back and look for themselves to see just how full of rubbish you are. \n\n \n Yes, that was post #148. In post #150, we see this;\n \n \nOriginally Posted by marc9000\n I acknowledge that the refrigerator takes usable energy and uses it to locally reduce entropy, but I refuse to acknowledge it's relevance because it is a step that is in between the source of energy and the reduction in entropy. Any complex reduction in entropy we see has to have that step. Evolution does not have that step! \n \n [electrolyte]Evolution has several of those steps; they are the steps between photosynthesis and reproduction. \n\n \n A non answer, you didn't describe them, and all the miracles associated with them.\n \n \n \n \n \nNo, the discussion concerned the limitations imposed by the second law of thermodynamics on the process of evolution. \n\n \n From post #122\n \nThird, you expose your ignorance of the topic at hand as wanting a single \"mechanism for evolution\" when the discussion concerned the second law of thermodynamics. \n\n \n Which was it? Why should I have continued the thread when you were confused about what we were talking about?\n \n \n A \"comparison\" is a disanalogy because while evolution is a process, the second law of thermodynamics is not. Now you are trying to spin the post-roasting discussion by mislabeling the topics. In fact, someone (pandion?) showed that your \"comparison\" is ridiculous because then the second law of thermodynamics would apply to his changing clothes. You, of course, had no response. \n\n \n Evolution and the second law of thermodynamics are both about natural changes, yet one is a process and the other is not, so that makes them incomparable?? And I'm the one trying to spin the discussion? Evolution seems to involve a lot of word games, I'll have to start a thread on that subject sometime.\n \n \n \nI understand the difference between the two, but when we look at what you actually wrote, with original emphasis:\n \n it is easy to see why I discussed establishment and funding, only to have you retort:\n At which point you had completely skirted the original topic of how evil you insist science is and condemn it based not on science itself but on its status as being publicly funded. So science is evil because it's publicly funded. Gotcha. \n\n \n I never used the word \"evil\", but if science is publicly funded, and a branch of it uses that funding to try to DESTROY religion, then it violates the first amendment.\n \n \n \nHow about I beat you to the punch?\n This is T.Q doing exactly what I said he did. \n\n \n Thanks for beating me to it - it makes it easier for me to make clear. He said that all right, but it wasn't in response to the line \"it's so silly it's not worth my time\". That one appeared two posts earlier, and he wasn't responding to it. It was my comment about something by Dawkins that I HAD read. \n \n \n \nThe question is not who is the ultimate authority, but how moral are \"traditional morals.\" \n\n \n With no ultimate (earthly) authority, it can't be determined how moral they are! \n \n \n That is to say, don't you support the death penalty for people who work on the sabbath and a father's right to sell his daughter into slavery? But I'll let you off the hook here, as this specific topic is really out of place in this forum. \n\n \n As are many of your strawmen.\n \n \n \nI never said it was. \n\n \n You indicated your cluelessness about their comparabilities;\n \n \nbecause I am insisting that you support your assertion that private funding is \"not comparable to\" public funding. \n\n \n They're not (politically) comparable because one is applicable to the first amendment and the other is not. I can't make it any clearer than that. And you claim victory when I abandon a thread. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n \nIt seems you are still working on your unsupported assertion that some part of science is religious. I'll ask for the umpteenth time, as this most certainly is the appropriate forum: Support your assertion. \n\n \n When science opposes religion to the point of publicly funded political opposition, it's religious. \n \n \n \nExposing talkorigins as what? An archive of scientific literature, exactly as I explained to you? \n\n \n If only you would have read the copy/paste from the link, it was so brief. I'm not going to repost it here. But here is one more link from talkorigins;\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/credentials.html\n \n \"Questionable Creationist Credentials\" hmmm, wonder where the \"Questionable Evolutionist Credendials\" page is? \n \n \nYour citation does nothing but misrepresent the stance of the talkorigins authors, then argue against the strawman trueorigins has created. Furthermore, even your own citation does nothing to answer my challenge to you to support your assertion that evolution is atheistic. \n\n \n I answered that challange, with the references to American Atheists, how they embrace evolution, and how they have a political agenda. Dozens of other atheist sites do as well. Atheism and evolution go together as well as Christianity and creation. To deny it is dishonest.\n \n \n \nIn other words, you are basing your claim on yet another unfounded assertion that Miller is not a Christian. Well, support your assertion. \n\n \n A Christian believes in the teaching of Christ, and Christ asserted creation many times.\n \n \n \nYet, this ridiculous behavior of yours has been so textbook that I specifically included a counter!\n \n So now you must show that both Miller and the entire ASA are phonies. Otherwise your assertion remains unsupported. \n\n \n The very broad term \"science\" includes both religious (controversial), and non religious (non controversial) subjects. Your counter fails. Spectacularly. \n \n \n \nA hormone-receptor system that fits the criteria to be considered \"irreducibly complex\" evolved naturally. What's vague about that? Your refusing to understand it doesn't subtract any credibility from it.\n\n \n I understand that it's about as mathematically impossible as anything can be.\n \n \n \n \nPerhaps it's not \"clear\" to you, but you obviously have trouble understanding biochemistry and evolution. How much clearer can it get than \"here is an irreducibly complex system that evolved naturally\"? \n\n \n That's just as clear as \"here is an irreducibly complex system that was created\". \n \n \n \nWe can come up with two: exaptation and scaffolding.\n Mathematical probabilities are not needed: in order to refute that claim that \"it is impossible for such a system to have evolved without intelligence,\" all that is required is that it is possible for any qualifying system to evolve. It is possible for irreducibly complex systems to evolve (e.g. hormone-receptor example above), so the claim is refuted.\n I predict a GotG tangent coming on...\n\n \n Why are mathematical probabilities not needed? They are secular - they are testable, repeatable, and observable. They are useful in determining if something has happened, just as useful in determining if something will happen. \n \n \n \nNo, I didn't imply it at all. And why would I refute the facts? They don't hurt my position at all. You're attacking it as if doing so helps your position, but it doesn't. \n\n \n It SEALS my position. It shows that science instruction in schools is largely political. \n \n \n \nIt's not that it requires multiple angles to roast ID, it's that ID is \"roastable\" from so many angles! \n\n \n And it has to be roasted from so many angles for the mathematical improbabilities of atheistic evolution to be politically accepted. \n \n \n \nI also stated that I don't know how these people resolve what I perceive to be major conflicts. I am not aware of all of the specific religious beliefs of Miller and the ASA.\n\n \n Then it's not very convincing when you try to use their arguments to prove your points, is it?",

Why should I have continued the thread when you were confused about what we were talking about?\n\n From post 124 of this thread:\n \nThe discussion concerned the comparison of the second law with evolution, because they are comparable.\n\n This is quite obviously false, as I have explained. There can be no \"comparison.\"\n The quotes you cite are neither misleading nor contradictory. The discussion concerned both the law and the limitations it imposes. It did not, however, explore any \"comparison.\"\n \n \nEvolution and the second law of thermodynamics are both about natural changes, yet one is a process and the other is not, so that makes them incomparable??\n\n \n From dictionary.com:\n \ncom\u00b7pare\n 1.

That is, if the invisible man told you that murder was perfectly acceptable, you'd be okay with it, and probably do it?\n And you think your system of ethics is superior, eh?\n Now is my turn to make the threat: you dare respond to this point with even the slightest substance, and I make a new thread in the appropriate forum. I can only hope you'll respond.\n \n \nThey're not (politically) comparable because one is applicable to the first amendment and the other is not. I can't make it any clearer than that.

The probability of said hormone-receptor system evolving is 1 (because it did, as showed in the study). Last time I checked, 1 is greater than 0. Feel free to double check that for me.\n \n \nThat's just as clear as \"here is an irreducibly complex system that was created\".\n\n What's wrong, do the big words confuse you, or something?\n \n \nWhy are mathematical probabilities not needed?\n\n Because all we need to do is show that the probability is greater than zero, i.e. possible, to counter the claim that \"it is impossible for this to evolve.\"\n \n \nIt SEALS my position.\n\n The existence of the BSCS seals your position? Care to explain how?\n \n \nAnd it has to be roasted from so many angles for the mathematical improbabilities of atheistic evolution to be politically accepted.\n\n No, I can roast it without appealing to probabilities:\n Behe's concept of IC has been so utterly falsified that he has changed the definition once, then had Dembski change it to a philosophically impossible position to prove (proving a universal negative). In fact, we have seen IC systems evolve!\n Dembski admits that his concept of SC appeals to Behe's concept of IC, which has been falsified. There is no supporting evidence for ID that has not been falsified.\n \n \nThen it's not very convincing when you try to use their arguments to prove your points, is it?\n\n I used your argument to prove my point, and it worked because your only defense is to call every self-professed Christian who accepts evolutionary theory a phony.\n \n \nThat you're a skilled strawman builder?\n\n Just because your strawmen are pitifully easy to knock down doesn't mean I'm experienced at building them.\n \n \nbut at least he doesn't blow a gasket every time I post.\n\n Blow a gasket?

Not only am I helping educate readers, I'm having a hell of a lot of fun making you look foolish.\n \n \nThe fact that you don't understand how politics affects much of what goes on in science speaks volumes of your disdain for me.\n\n So my alleged non-understanding of the politics of science somehow relates to how I feel about you? \"Oh yeah, I don't know anything about the politics of science all because I don't like this guy named marc...\"\n I can now only wonder if you actually comprehend what I write.\n \n \nI have, you'd see it if you'd uncover your eyes and ears.\n\n Oh no, I've been looking. I even blasted you on your silly \"atheism vs. secularism\" thread. Other people have asked too, and even made fun of you. If you have indeed supported your assertion instead of simply repeated the claim, but refuse to repost it, you could at least link to it.\n \n \nThe two biggest ones in Darwinism, were;\n \n 1) The disproof that the universe is eternal\n\n What the hell does cosmology have to do with \"Darwinism\"? (Answer: nothing.)\n \n \nThe very recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life. \n\n Neither of your responses are worded in a way that makes sense.

It's been done with Darwinism more than once.\n\n For #2, what was being tested? What was the hypothesis? What was proven incorrect? What fit?\n \n \nMan spent billions of years making them?\n\n Oh, I'm sorry, the answer we were looking for was \"by applying knowledge of evolutionary theory.\" But it's been a pleasure having you on our show, and we have some nice parting gifts for you...\n \n \nHas the time come when I'm not going to be able to post to anybody, anywhere on these forums without getting your insults?\n\n Has the time come when you've realized that your claptrap won't fly, especially when you won't even stand up and defend it instead of screaming the same thing over and over with no support whatsoever?\n \n \nWould you rather I didn't post here?

Science may not consciously reject anything, but it does accept/reject hypothesis based on the data. \n\n \n It's not that simple, because science has political and economic ties, and imperfect humans analyze data. Often the same exact data is examined by different scientists, and different conclusions are reached.\n \n \nIt's not possible to prove the boogeyman doesn't exist either.

Watching the films of people jumping from the WTC was completely different for me than any movie.\n \n \nThe flood loses no effect as a metaphor, even to tender youths. \n\n \n That's fine, that's as far as it can go - it's something we have to agree to disagree on.

They combine with some basics - the sudden beginning of the universe, the complexity of cells, etc. I don't see enough \"good apples\", (atheist apples) to convincingly counter them.\n \n \nFurthermore, the method you describe is the sole method of investigation for creationists and ID'ers, because the hypothesis CANNOT be rejected BY DEFINITION. \n\n \n I agree, the method of investigation for the two positions are comparable.

Or could it be his ever increasing attempt to divert by his referals to the \"logical fallacies\"? I've exposed this before with someone else a year or two ago here (that one was a bundle of agitation too: :p ), but I suppose it needs to be done again.\n \n The logical fallacies list (Don Lindsay's seems to be one of the standards) seems to be a place for atheists / liberals to run when their argument isn't going too well for them. Most of them don't mean much - they happen on both sides during a debate. Things like the \"arguments from authorities, arguments from selective reading, strawman, ad hominem, poisoning wells\" etc. etc. - they're really not worth mentioning. Simply clamoring the two and three word phrases in a debate can be a diversion. The amazing part is, atheists / liberals seem to believe that they are not applicable to themselves, only their opponents. That's the only reason I ever bring them up, like \"strawman\" for example. Electrolyte accuses, but exempts himself from that one all the time.\n \n While they seem to be geared to help the atheist / liberal, there is one there that really impresses me. \"Argument by Emotive Language\", I'm surprised it's there, because it's a favorite of atheists / liberals. \n \n Lindsay's description;\n \n Using emotionally loaded words to sway the audience's sentiments instead of their minds. Many emotions can be useful: anger, spite, condescention, and so on. \n \n For example, argument by condescension: Support the ERA? Sure, when the women start paying for the drinks! Hah! Hah! \n\n \n Similar to \"roasting the daylights out of you! Hah! Hah!\"\n \n While the emotive language one is an exception to the rule, I find most of them to be swayed to favor atheism / liberalism, it's obvious the way Lindsay refers to abortion, Ronald Reagan, etc. in his examples. But some \"logical fallacies\" are wrongly labeled that way, by Lindsay, and others. His big one is the \"slippery slope / camels nose\" fallacy. It's simply not a fallacy, it's true. U.S. politics is loaded with examples of it, from incremental increases in taxation in the last 100 years, to increasing limits on smoking in public places, to judicial activism. \"Argument from improbability\" doesn't seem to appear on his list, maybe electrolyte made it up, maybe it's on someone else's list, or maybe I missed it, but it's false also. Mathematical improbabilities are not a false way of determining the reasonable likelihood of something. It's scientific.",

   "They are not similar, or equal, or even analogous. The only similarity you can come up with is that \"they are both about natural changes,\" but so are countless other things that you wouldn't dare \"compare.\" \n\n \n There are many other things that are comparable to the second law of thermodynamics. Many things run down, go to disorder, lose energy, etc. Non creation evolution seems to be the only exception to all of them, even though it supposedly happens in the same conditions.\n \n \n \n In fact, when I countered with the example of a growing embryo, which is about natural changes, you hand-waved it away as not relevant. You are doing what is called \"special pleading,\" which is yet another fallacy. \n\n \n Growing and evolving are two different things.\n \n \n \n \nSupport your assertion that science \"tries to DESTROY religion.\"\n Oh, what's that? You refuse yet again? Aw, I'm so shocked...\n\n \n I have. Dilligent searches for tiltaalik roseae, guesses about desiccation cracks......the Dover Pa. court case. My copy/paste of American Atheist embrace of science. It's all throughout U.S. politics and court cases. \n \n \n \n \nSo you need some invisible man in the sky to tell you that murder is wrong?! \n\n \n It makes a difference if he tells me I'm accountable for it. Murder happens all the time - who that commits it thinks he will be accountable for it after this life? Almost no one. \n \n \nThat is, if the invisible man told you that murder was perfectly acceptable, you'd be okay with it, and probably do it?\n And you think your system of ethics is superior, eh?\n Now is my turn to make the threat: you dare respond to this point with even the slightest substance, and I make a new thread in the appropriate forum. I can only hope you'll respond. \n\n \n Well this is your lucky day!!!!!!! The Bible is in two divisions, LAW and GOSPEL. Those who know something about the Bible know how to blend them and apply them, to distinguish between history, the personality of God, the evil of satan, and guidelines for living. Start that thread.\n \n \n \nNo, you lose by default when your argument hinges upon science's being atheistic, but you are unable to support that assertion.\n \n You may notice a pattern here. marc repeatedly appeals to this notion that, because science (or evolution) is atheistic, certain consequences are true. However, marc never, ever supports this notion, even when he is asked numerous times by numerous people to do so.\n \"I can't make it any clearer than that.\" \n\n \n You can't make it any clearer that you have your eyes and ears covered. I have done it many times - the rhetoric on just about ANY atheist site, including talkorigins, proves it. Atheism didn't have a foundation for a long time - Darwin provided it. Before that, those who didn't want to acknowledge a creator were forced to shrug when asked about origins. Here's a quote from Richard Dawkins;\n \n \nDarwin make it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. \n\n \n How about this one, from William Provine, another evolutionist;\n \n \nDarwinism is the greatest engine of atheism devised by man. \n\n \n The ACLU once sued a school district for putting stickers in biology textbooks that urged students to study evolution with an open mind. Violated separation of church and state, don't cha know. You can get every atheist on this board to come here and say that evolution and atheism are completely unrelated. Anyone reading here without a tightly closed mind, with the slightest ability to \"freethink\", knows better. Please keep asking me to prove it, it's so laughable.\n \n \n \nSupport your assertion.\n (See, folks?)\n\n \n See folks? \n \n \nOf course you won't, because as I explained, it's trash.\n\n \n You didn't explain anything, you called it a strawman, nothing more. Post#127. \n \n \n \nThere are millions of Christians who would beg to differ. You seem to have lots of trouble with this topic. \n\n \n No, the trouble is yours, because none of them post here.\n \n \n .\n \n \n \nSo if there is any single teaching of Christ that you do not believe, does that make you not a Christian? \n\n \n Righto. In not believing it, you claim to know more than Christ. There are many Christians who don't understand one or more teachings of Christ, and may violate them, but they realize that the problem is with them, not Christ.\n \n \n \nPlease define \"controversial\" as used in this context, including at least three examples of both \"controversial\" and \"non-controversial\" subjects. Be sure to include criteria for distinguishing between the two. \n\n \n Non-controversial;\n \n Newton's first law of motion\n The laws of thermodynamics\n Gravitational acceleration\n \n Controversial;\n \n Tiktaalik roseae being an ancestor of humans\n Desiccation cracks indication of no flood\n The overall benefit of stem cell research\n \n Distinguishing between them shouldn't be difficult. \n \n \nNo, the probability of rolling a 7 on a standard die is 0. The probability of said hormone-receptor system evolving is 1 (because it did, as showed in the study). Last time I checked, 1 is greater than 0. Feel free to double check that for me.\n\n \n Darwin's knowledge of cell complexity and bacterial flagellum were considerably less than what's known today. Let's compare his knowledge to a safe, with a combination dial of 39 numbers, and a three number, left-right-left combination. The probability of \"natural selection\" opening it would be one in 64,000. (40x40x40) Now let's compare today's knowledge of it with another safe with a more complicated mechanism; 99 numbers, and a five number combination left-right-left-right-left. (100x100x100x100x100) Rather than a 1 in 64,000 chance for evolution to work, it's now 1 in 10 billion. There is probably a greater difference in Darwin's knowledge and what we know today about cell complexity than there is in the two safe mechanisms - chances for evolution is probably even less than the difference between 64,000 and 10 billion. But it shows that the more complicated something is, the chances of it ramdomly happening decrease exponentially. \n \n \n \n \nBecause all we need to do is show that the probability is greater than zero, i.e. possible, to counter the claim that \"it is impossible for this to evolve.\" \n\n \n And that qualifies it as science? \n \n \nThe existence of the BSCS seals your position? Care to explain how?\n\n \n The details of how it began, and is funded, seals it. I explained it - you probably missed it.\n \n \n \nNo, I can roast it without appealing to probabilities:\n Behe's concept of IC has been so utterly falsified that he has changed the definition once, then had Dembski change it to a philosophically impossible position to prove (proving a universal negative). In fact, we have seen IC systems evolve!\n Dembski admits that his concept of SC appeals to Behe's concept of IC, which has been falsified. There is no supporting evidence for ID that has not been falsified.\n\n \n Since you don't name any sources, since it never made the front pages of the NY Times, since churches all across the U.S. aren't closing down, that sounds like \"controversial\" science to me.\n \n \n \n \nBlow a gasket? Are you kidding? Do you think there's any lurker who agrees with you? \n\n \n Considering some of the polls taken in the U.S. about the possibility of a creator, yes there could be a chance of it.\n \n \n Not only am I helping educate readers, I'm having a hell of a lot of fun making you look foolish.\n \n \n So my alleged non-understanding of the politics of science somehow relates to how I feel about you? \n\n \n Yes, because I'm pointing it out. \n \n \n \"Oh yeah, I don't know anything about the politics of science all because I don't like this guy named marc...\"\n I can now only wonder if you actually comprehend what I write. \n\n \n No, you're posting about things related to the politics of science, and this discussion is making it painfully clear to you and everyone that you don't know anything about the politics of science. And somehow, you blame me for it.\n \n \n \nOh no, I've been looking. I even blasted you on your silly \"atheism vs. secularism\" thread. Other people have asked too, and even made fun of you. If you have indeed supported your assertion instead of simply repeated the claim, but refuse to repost it, you could at least link to it. \n\n \n Yes, I just glanced over the \"atheism vs. secularism\" thread. You became very angry - you \"blasted\", several \"made fun of\". If only you knew how to debate. Maybe you wouldn't be so afraid of alternative views to evolution in schools. \n \n \n \nWhat the hell does cosmology have to do with \"Darwinism\"? (Answer: nothing.) \n\n \n I thought you were having fun - it's not standard to use four letter words when you're having fun. emoticon_confused \n \n If the universe were eternal as Darwin thought, there were plenty of areas for exploration in how life originated. Since it was later discovered that the universe had an immediate, sudden beginning, it reduced the possibilities greatly. In 150 years, all atheists have been able to dream up is a \"big bang\". (an explosion) It's not rocket science to know that life would have a very difficult time being created by, or surviving, an explosion. But NOTHING can shake the Darwin dogma. \n \n \n \nNeither of your responses are worded in a way that makes sense. Your original statement was:\n For #2, what was being tested? What was the hypothesis? What was proven incorrect? What fit? \n\n \n I was referring to no one specific thing. Many Darwinian theories are shown to be much less mathematically possible by recent scientific discoveries. But the dogma of Darwinism is never phased.\n \n \n \nOh, I'm sorry, the answer we were looking for was \"by applying knowledge of evolutionary theory.\" But it's been a pleasure having you on our show, and we have some nice parting gifts for you...\n\n \n How does an atheistic worldview help us make flu vaccines?\n \n \n \nHas the time come when you've realized that your claptrap won't fly, especially when you won't even stand up and defend it instead of screaming the same thing over and over with no support whatsoever? \n\n \n Pot.

   "I would suggest marc that if you have the proof that science is atheistic, that you post it whenever asked so as to prove it to the rest of us. If that proof relies on the fact that there are atheists practising science then I wouldn't bother. That argument is ridiculous to the point of absurdity. \n\n \n The term \"science\" is a broad term, just like the term \"evolution\". They both have political and economic ties. They can be used to oppose religion, (to prohibit the free exercise therof, among other things) and it violates the first amendment.

   "[quoting Waxy]\nIt's not possible to prove the boogeyman doesn't exist either. However, if 99.999999% of the data, and 99.9% of the scientists - people who understand the data, both Christian and non-Christian - are in agreement, then I think you have a fairly strong case. About as strong as it gets actually.\n\n Yes you do. But the 99.9% figure you refer to doesn't apply to evolution, or a single political controversy today for that matter.\n\n Let's nip this in the bud.\n Of the scientists and engineers in the United States, only about 5% are creationists, according to a 1991 Gallup poll (Robinson 1995, Witham 1997). However, this number includes those working in fields not related to life origins (such as computer scientists, mechanical engineers, etc.). Taking into account only those working in the relevant fields of earth and life sciences, there are about 480,000 scientists, but only about 700 believe in \"creation-science\" or consider it a valid theory (Robinson 1995). This means that less than 0.15 percent of relevant scientists believe in creationism. And that is just in the United States, which has more creationists than any other industrialized country. In other countries, the number of relevant scientists who accept creationism drops to less than one tenth of 1 percent.(Source)\n So marc may have a point, for a change, if we try really hard to skew the stats. Notice that the (whopping) figure of 0.15% includes those who believe in \"creation-science\" or consider it a valid theory, regardless of whether they believe it. This means that it is possible that only a mere 99.85% of scientists who are from the creationist-laden United States and are working in relevant fields accept evolution. Of course, once we include all scientists worldwide who are working in relevant fields, Waxy's claim is true.\n Notice also that marc doesn't dispute that \"99.999999%\" of the data is in agreement.\n \n \n[quoting Waxy]\nHopefully then, they'll either have an understanging of logic, or illogical parents that continue to tell them what to think and believe.\n\n Or agenda based teachers that continue to tell them what to think and believe?\n\n It is quite ironic that marc states the above in post 147, and in post 148 whines that pointing out logical fallacies are meaningless and out of place in a discussion or debate. That is, he seems to think that the rules of logic should not apply.\n No, marc, pointing out logical fallacies is the simplest way of stating, \"Your argument is invalid.\" Just because you don't understand logic doesn't mean it doesn't apply. However, since logic is a method of determining truth values of statements, I can see why you want to avoid logic like the plague.\n Any time you care to point out a fallacy of mine, go right ahead. (You know that I certainly don't hesitate to blast you for presenting them.) However, your whines of \"that's a strawman!\" and \"ad hom attack\" had better have a legitimate explanation, rather than bare assertions and subsequent ignoring of my points.\n \n \nThe \"discoveries\" (and theories) of desiccation cracks, or tiktaalik roseae may just be accidental findings while searching for vaccines, but I suspect there could possibly be other motives.\n\n Hey, you the one proclaiming there was a flood, and you haven't explained why land would dry out during a global flood. And while Tiktaalik wasn't sought after specifically to make your point even more indefensible, it still does.\n \n \nOr could it be his ever increasing attempt to divert by his referals to the \"logical fallacies\"?\n\n Divert? It's not a diversion at all; it's all that is required to rebut your ridiculous arguments.\n \n \nThe logical fallacies list (Don Lindsay's seems to be one of the standards) seems to be a place for atheists / liberals to run when their argument isn't going too well for them.\n\n Don Lindsay has one? Why am I just now finding this out?! After all, I've simply been using the ones I learned when I took a logic course at an accredited university. Silly me.\n \n \nThings like the \"arguments from authorities, arguments from selective reading, strawman, ad hominem, poisoning wells\" etc. etc. - they're really not worth mentioning.\n\n Perhaps you don't want them mentioned because it just shows how pitifully weak your position is? In reality, letting debate opponent get away with a formal logical fallacy is unheard of.\n \n \nThat's the only reason I ever bring them up, like \"strawman\" for example. Electrolyte accuses, but exempts himself from that one all the time.\n\n As I said above, you are more than welcome to point out my logical fallacies, but if you're crying \"strawman\" like you so often tend to do, you'd better have a legitimate explanation.\n \n \nSimilar to \"roasting the daylights out of you! Hah! Hah!\"\n\n No, marc, I use the phrase because I like using it, not because I think it will sway anybody. I try to sway people by explaining how ludicrous your position is.\n In fact, it is you who repeatedly asks why I am \"agitated\" by you, and I repeatedly respond that this is fun for me. \n \n \n\"Argument from improbability\" doesn't seem to appear on his list, maybe electrolyte made it up, maybe it's on someone else's list, or maybe I missed it, but it's false also. Mathematical improbabilities are not a false way of determining the reasonable likelihood of something. It's scientific.\n\n The argument from improbability is my name for the argument from probability used in the \"improbable\" way. It's an informal logical fallacy.\n While your argument is false, the fallacy is legit. Your proclaiming that this is not a fallacy is the \"hand-waving\" behavior of yours to which I often refer: \"[This] is something I don't like and can't refute, so I simply claim it's wrong and otherwise ignore it.\" Another way to describe this behavior is yet another informal logical fallacy, Wishful Thinking.\n Pay attention to the \"exceptions\" part at the bottom of the first link I gave above. You are wanting to appeal to that exception, but your \"possibility\" is unsupported as being probable, so your argument is fallacious.\n \n \nThere are many other things that are comparable to the second law of thermodynamics. Many things run down, go to disorder, lose energy, etc.\n\n So you're arguing that the second law of thermodynamics runs down or goes to disorder? If you want to apply the law to processes, go right ahead, but \"making comparisons\" to it makes no sense.\n \n \nNon creation evolution seems to be the only exception to all of them, even though it supposedly happens in the same conditions. [emphasis added for later]\n\n I have repeatedly stated that the second law of thermodynamics is what allows for the chemical processes that result in evolution, i.e., that evolution is not excepted from the law. marc is now purposely misrepresenting my statements.\n \n \nIn fact, when I countered with the example of a growing embryo, which is about natural changes, you hand-waved it away as not relevant. You are doing what is called \"special pleading,\" which is yet another fallacy.\n\n Growing and evolving are two different things.\n\n Even though they are \"both about natural changes that happen in the same conditions...\"\n See, this is how your argumentation tends to go: I nail you on special pleading, and you provide an \"explanation.\" I then give you an example (again) that comforms to your explanation, and you commit the same fallacy! If your argument is that \"the second law and evolution are both about natural changes that happen in the same conditions, and you think that that makes them \"comparable,\" yet you refuse to discuss \"growing and evolving\" even though they are both about natural changes that happen in the same conditions, you are the one \"exempting\" himself from the facts. But really, you do that all the time; this is just a great, hilarious example.\n \n \nDilligent searches for tiltaalik roseae,\n\n Searching for fossils is a search for facts. Are you saying that searching for facts is an attempt to destroy religion?\n \n \nguesses about desiccation cracks\n\n They're not guesses, as shown by the page I linked. Once again, just because you want them to be guesses...\n \n \nthe Dover Pa. court case.\n\n Did you forget? You weren't embarassed enough that I nailed your ignorance of Judge Jones's religion? Jones is a Lutheran; why would he try to destroy his own religion?\n (Oh, that's right, he must be one of those \"phonies.\" You see, when your argument that \"science is atheistic\" relies on all these \"phonies,\" you have to show that they are phonies. Good luck!)\n \n \nIt makes a difference if he tells me I'm accountable for it.\n\n So you would murder if you weren't accountable?!\n You didn't answer my other question, so we'll get our wish: be sure to see my OP in the philosophy section.\n \n \nI have done it many times - the rhetoric on just about ANY atheist site, including talkorigins, proves it.\n\n You have failed in your attempt to \"prove\" that talkorigins is an atheist site. By saying that talkorigins promotes science, and that science is atheistic, to conclude that talkorigins is atheistic is assuming that which you are trying to prove: that science/evolution is atheistic. That is (you guessed it) a logical fallacy called circular reasoning, or begging the question.\n If talkorigins is truly an atheist site, it should be easy to provide several quotations from talkorigins.org that endorse atheism.\n Furthermore, your method of \"proof\" has been reduced to absurdity. Your objection to this rebuttal failed because you didn't even attempt to show that theists who accept evolutionary theory are not actually theists. You simply label them as liars.\n \n \nAtheism didn't have a foundation for a long time - Darwin provided it.\n\n Irrelevant, but refutable anyway: Arguments for atheism existed long before Darwin; else why would the very old arguments for the existence of a deity exist?\n \n \nThe ACLU once sued a school district for putting stickers in biology textbooks that urged students to study evolution with an open mind. Violated separation of church and state, don't cha know.\n\n Because the stickers were put on the textbooks for religious reasons: the law failed the first prong of the Lemon test.\n \n \nPlease keep asking me to prove it, it's so laughable.\n\n No problem!\n \n \nYou didn't explain anything, you called it a strawman, nothing more. Post#127.\n\n It is a strawman: it builds talkorigins up as atheistic, which it is not, then blasts it for being atheistic.\n Let's look at the crux of the trueorigins argument:\n \nYet, anyone who knows the score realizes that middle-grounders are at best marginally tolerated by 'pure-blood' naturalists-as these say, \"the hypothesis of God is unnecessary!\"\n\n In other words, \"everybody knows that evolutionists are theist-hating warmongers, so we conclude that evolution is atheistic.\" (And marc is the one saying that logical fallacies like \"argument by emotive language\" are only for \"atheists / liberals.\") Yes, everybody who knows anything knows this! But \"this\" is what they are trying to prove. As I explained above, this is circular reasoning.\n \n \nNo, the trouble is yours, because none of them post here.\n\n So it is your position that, because no theistic evolutionists post here, that theistic evolutionists don't exist?! I need not reduce this to absurdity, because it is so obviously absurd. (But I will if you'd like, in case you don't realize it and would like me to show you.) Nor do I really need to point out that earlier in one of our threads, a theistic evolutionist posted an explicit mention to you that he was indeed a theistic evolutionist.\n \n \nRighto. In not believing it, you claim to know more than Christ.\n\n Ah, how foolish of me to be taken in by wordplay. Not all theists are Christians; that is, one can be a theist but not Christian. So whether theistic proponents of evolutionary theory are Christian or not is really irrelevant, because they are theists.\n \n \nDistinguishing between them shouldn't be difficult.\n\n Then an explanation of the distinguishing characteristics shouldn't be difficult, but you didn't give any. Funny that, yes?\n \n \n[snip irrelevant claptrap] But it shows that the more complicated something is, the chances of it ramdomly happening decrease exponentially.\n\n \"Exponentially\"? No, you understand neither science nor math. The less probable it is for something to happen, the less likely it is to happen randomly.\n However, the more chances an improbable event has to result, the more likely it is to result, and there have been many chances over 4.6 billion years. More importantly, though, evolution is not random.\n \n \nAnd that qualifies it as science?\n\n It falsifies the claim, which is all it tries to do.\n \n \nThe details of how it began, and is funded, seals it. I explained it - you probably missed it.\n\n I guess I don't understand how an organization that strives to teach science to children is bad.\n \n \nSince you don't name any sources, since it never made the front pages of the NY Times, since churches all across the U.S. aren't closing down, that sounds like \"controversial\" science to me.\n\n It's not so much science as philosophy, which must be why you abhor it. Here is a damning examination on the shifting goalposts of the IC spinsters.\n Wait... Churches aren't closing down? Why would churches be closing down if IC is falsified and ID is trash, if, as ID proponents have been proclaiming, ID isn't religious? See, marc, when you reveal this, it's just plain funny.\n \n \nNo, you're posting about things related to the politics of science, and this discussion is making it painfully clear to you and everyone that you don't know anything about the politics of science. And somehow, you blame me for it.\n \n\n I'm trying to stick to science, but because your position is so indefensible, you keep trying to pull the subject away from science and attack the politics of science. However, now you're changing tunes, because earlier you were saying that you were responsible for my allegedly not being aware of the politics of science. Now you're saying I \"blame\" you for it. Well, I hate to tell you, but not only do I not \"blame\" you for anything but giving me lots of enjoyment, but I know plenty of politics of science. In fact, you ran away from my examples of funding that refuted your claim that only politically motivated endeavors get funded.\n \n \nIf only you knew how to debate.\n\n This coming from the guy who thinks that pointing out logical fallacies has no place in a debate... Yeesh.\n \n \nMaybe you wouldn't be so afraid of alternative views to evolution in schools.\n\n If you can support your \"alternative views\" with valid science, I'll support the inclusion of said views in science classes. Once again, put up or shut up. The creationists have been trying for decades, and their latest slaughter in Harrisburg was indicative of their case.\n \n \nI thought you were having fun - it's not standard to use four letter words when you're having fun.\n\n I am having fun: I was excited that you gave me such fodder!\n \n \nIf the universe were eternal as Darwin thought, there were plenty of areas for exploration in how life originated. Since it was later discovered that the universe had an immediate, sudden beginning, it reduced the possibilities greatly.\n\n Another argument from improbability, and yet another strawman: evolutionary theory does not encompass the origin of life. You know this, marc, but because your position is so weak, you repeatedly refer to it.\n \n \nIn 150 years, all atheists have been able to dream up is a \"big bang\". (an explosion) It's not rocket science to know that life would have a very difficult time being created by, or surviving, an explosion. But NOTHING can shake the Darwin dogma.\n\n Once again, your scientific illiteracy doesn't hinder science. Your referring to the big bang as \"an explosion\" simply illustrates your ignorance of the theory, as well as any of the mounds of supporting evidence. Moreover, you don't understand even the simplest science (by your own admission), so when you say something is \"not rocket science,\" what can you possibly mean except, \"I can't explain it, so I'm not going to\"?\n \n \nI was referring to no one specific thing. Many Darwinian theories are shown to be much less mathematically possible by recent scientific discoveries. But the dogma of Darwinism is never phased.\n\n I asked for specific examples, and you have not provided them. Instead of generically saying, \"oh, hey, there's math, and stuff,\" provide an example. Support your assertion. Put up or shut up.\n \n \nHow does an atheistic worldview help us make flu vaccines?\n\n It doesn't. Evolutionary theory does.\n See, if you're going to keep appealing to this silly argument, you'll have to support it.\n \n \nPot. Kettle.\n\n No, see, I support my statements. You handwave, commit fallacies, and refuse to defend your points.",

   "It's not that simple, because science has political and economic ties, and imperfect humans analyze data. Often the same exact data is examined by different scientists, and different conclusions are reached.\n\n \n That's why data is shared and there's a peer review process. Science has multiple checks and balances built into it to ensure that the \"imperfect human\" impact is minimized.\n \n I also find it rather funny marc, that the Bible is every bit, in fact far moreso, open to the imperfect analysis of humans, and is far more often abused for political and economic reasons, and yet you've turned a completely blind eye to that reality. \n \n You believe that you, or at least others who share your exact beliefs, are correct, and all others are wrong. \n \n \nYes you do. But the 99.9% figure you refer to doesn't apply to evolution, or a single political controversy today for that matter. \n\n \n Yes it does marc. There's no argument here. The facts are on my side. Whether you like it or not, it's as simple as that.\n \n Thanks to electrolyte for saving me the time I was going to have to spend to searching this to back up my claim.\n \n \nI made your point for you? emoticon_confused \n\n \n You pointed out clearly that mankind, at least in living memory, has never experienced anything like a worldwide flood, our accounts of it are every bit as verifiable and real as a Stephen King novel.\n \n \nNo. Has anyone alive ever experienced the civil war? I've seen a few Stephen Segal / Clint Eastwood / Charles Bronsen movies where a whole lot of people were \"killed\". Those movies just didn't have the same effect on me as actual accounts of the suffering and killing that went on in the civil war. They don't now, and they didn't when I went to school as a child, and learned about actual history.\n\n \n What actual history do you have of the flood? Do you have any actual accounts of the suffering and destruction? Any artifacts? Any specific sites? Anything at all that can be compared to the actual history of the civil war that learned about?\n \n Of course not. I think there are a couple movies from the 50's or 60's though.\n \n \nI don't have a bit of trouble distinguishing between the two. Watching the films of people jumping from the WTC was completely different for me than any movie.\n\n \n Marc, I know you're stubborn as hell, but I also think you're fairly intelligent. I think you know full well that the account of the flood is far closer to a Hollywood movie than watching footage of the planes crashing into the towers. There's no comparison, they're worlds apart. I know it, and you know it. \n \n \nThat's fine, that's as far as it can go - it's something we have to agree to disagree on. Now if it could be left there, and I didn't get any personal insults about it, this forum could be a better place.\n \n \n We can agree to disagree marc, but you have to realize that your position has been made untenable. You are standing pat on faith, not reason or logic.\n If you can accept that reality, then I have no problem agreeing to disagree.\n \n \nOr agenda based teachers that continue to tell them what to think and believe?\n\n \n Teaching kids the scientific method and providing them with an understanding of how the natural world around them works, is not telling them what to think or believe. It's providing them with the facts, and more importantly, the method for determining what is fact and what is not. Independent and critical thinking are most important things that any child should learn. Unfortunately, those things are the enemy of organized religion.\n \n \nEvolution (as in non creation) isn't comparable to those things. \n\n \n Evolution is completely comparable to the those things. It is a proven scientific hypothesis, supported by an overwhelming amount of scientific data. It is used as a tool every day, in the same ways, to provide the same types of advances for technology, medicine, etc...\n \n If you want to get into philosophy, which is how you clearly want to view evolution, then I would agree, but we would no longer be discussing evolution.\n \n \nWell, those are part of the proof. Just because we've seen them a hundred times means they're no longer valid? They combine with some basics - the sudden beginning of the universe, the complexity of cells, etc. I don't see enough \"good apples\", (atheist apples) to convincingly counter them.\n\n \n Then you haven't opened your eyes and mind. They are all around you.\n \n I'm not going to get into this in greater detail, it's been done to death, and you continue to beat the dead horse.\n \n \nI agree, the method of investigation for the two positions are comparable. Yet, according to our wonderful courts, one is science and the other is not.\n \n \n You're twisting and spinning. It's intentionally dishonest, and I have no interest in continuing such a discussion.\n \n \nBy philosophical evolution, I mean the religion of non-creation. If it's taught to children as science, it won't change practical science, but it will affect it politically and economically. Note my sig.\n\n \n \"The religion of non-creation\". I'd have a hard time coming up with a more meaningless term. \n \n Children are taught science and facts in science class. Your disagreement does not change those facts or the scientific method.\n \n You are free as a parent to teach you child whatever you like, including creationism. You are free to enroll your child in religious schools where they will be taught creationism and the Bible. You can even take them to creationist museums and \"science\" camps.\n \n Unfortunately marc, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. If given all of the information, from both sides, and a choice, it's up to the individual child what he/she will ultimately accept as fact and base their beliefs upon.

   "Quote:\n Sorry marc, you lose that one.\n \n Oh no!! (GazzaElliot is not made glad by that comment)\n\n \n Eh?????\n \n \nQuote:\n I'm not sure what you mean by \"philosophical evolution\", but seeing as it's a meaningless term regardless, I agree, it won't change a thing when it comes to practical science.\n \n Waxy\n \n By philosophical evolution, I mean the religion of non-creation. If it's taught to children as science, it won't change practical science, but it will affect it politically and economically. Note my sig.\n\n \n Evolution is a scientific fact. Your attempt to move it into religion fails. Evolution is not a religion. You may not like the idea, but tough. Evolution is not a religion. There are several creeds which don't preach creation, but evolution is not one of them....\n \n \nQuote:\n Furthermore, the method you describe is the sole method of investigation for creationists and ID'ers, because the hypothesis CANNOT be rejected BY DEFINITION.\n \n I agree, the method of investigation for the two positions are comparable. Yet, according to our wonderful courts, one is science and the other is not.\n\n \n It's almost funny how you special plead until you're blue in the face for some causes, and then call others out on it. Waxy has made a valid point. ID and creationism cannot be tested, because the answer is ultimately \"God did it\". This cannot be tested, and therefore cannot be disproved and is therefore not science. Evolution could be disproved or rethought (I imagine that this is the process that you are attempting to attack). The fact that it has lasted so long with only jokers like you thinking they've shot it down is suggestive of the fact that it works as it is. Evolution is an observed fact. The exact mechanisms of speciation are debated, however to say that ID and creationism are at the same stage is farcical... \n \n \nWhat points are those? The personal insults? The attempts to divert the discussion by referring to irrelevent detailed \"science\"? The \"discoveries\" (and theories) of desiccation cracks, or tiktaalik roseae may just be accidental findings while searching for vaccines, but I suspect there could possibly be other motives. Or could it be his ever increasing attempt to divert by his referals to the \"logical fallacies\"? I've exposed this before with someone else a year or two ago here (that one was a bundle of agitation too: ), but I suppose it needs to be done again.\n\n \n So what are you attempting to do here? You're not debating what was said, you're attacking the means in which it was said. More proof, if it was needed, that you really don't have a clue. The fact you refer to it as \"irrelevant detailed \"science\" is hilarious. You accuse science of not having the answers, and then dismiss the explanations as irrelevant. For your information, logical fallacies can not be fake. The original principal of logic was that it was a chain of reasoning. If a link does not work, then the chain collapses. If the point made can be reasonably shown to be illogical, subsequent deductions based on that point are inaccurate.... So when a logical fallacy is brought up, provided it can be reasonably established, the logical process demands that the chain of reasoning collapses\n \n \nMathematical improbabilities are not a false way of determining the reasonable likelihood of something. It's scientific.\n\n \n True. However, any mathematician will tell you that improbability does not equal impossibility.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by GazzaElliott\n I would suggest marc that if you have the proof that science is atheistic, that you post it whenever asked so as to prove it to the rest of us. If that proof relies on the fact that there are atheists practising science then I wouldn't bother. That argument is ridiculous to the point of absurdity.\n \n The term \"science\" is a broad term, just like the term \"evolution\". They both have political and economic ties. They can be used to oppose religion, (to prohibit the free exercise therof, among other things) and it violates the first amendment. It's all throughout U.S. politics - you're not from the U.S. and electrolyte knows nothing about it, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening.\n\n \n And you have assumed that, not being from the US I can't possibly understand.... Hmmm. Have you considered that the reason your religion (whichever branch of Christianity that is) isn't being sung in the streets is that other people don't agree with it? I'd concentrate more on spreading the good word, rather than moaning that it's all the fault of the evil atheists... You actually have a president who is a member of the religious right, and who is happy to enforce the spread of American style democracy around the world because it's his calling, and you're moaning that the scientists have all the political power? Funny that...\n \n \nQuote:\n I would also suggest that you stop the 'I beat you', 'No, you didn't I beat you'. As all it does is convince the rest of us that you don't have anything important to say.....\n \n So it's MY fault? Do you suggest it only to me? Have you noticed who does almost all of that? Do the words \"roasted the daylights out of you\" ring a bell?\n\n \n I apologise. I should have made it clear that I meant both sides of the argument. (Look everyone! An apology! Is the universe still here?)\n \n \nPosted By Waxy\n If given all of the information, from both sides, and a choice, it's up to the individual child what he/she will ultimately accept as fact and base their beliefs upon. I know that thought scares the dickens out of you.\n\n \n That's why they rarely give their children the choice, and why those children are excommunicated if they do choose...",

Science has multiple checks and balances built into it to ensure that the \"imperfect human\" impact is minimized. \n\n \n You believe there's no room for improvement in the checks and balances system? That it's already a wide open, unlimited, near perfect process? Nothing that science finds today comes close to questioning the 150 year old thoughts of Darwin? Scientists want him to be perfect as much as Christians want Christ to be perfect, it seems. \n \n \nI also find it rather funny marc, that the Bible is every bit, in fact far moreso, open to the imperfect analysis of humans, and is far more often abused for political and economic reasons, and yet you've turned a completely blind eye to that reality. \n\n \n It's open to it I guess, but it's never been revised in thousands of years, so apparantly it's stood the test of human anaylsis pretty well. It is ignored more and more as time goes by (just as it predicts). Do you think today's generation is more qualified to analyze it than past generations? If today's generation is more qualified to analyze it's historical claims because of technology, is today's generation equally more qualified to analyze its moral and rules-for-behavior content? Have we made equal advances in human behavior knowledge as we have in nuts-and-bolts science? \n \n \nYou believe that you, or at least others who share your exact beliefs, are correct, and all others are wrong. \n\n \n And you don't?

Whether you like it or not, it's as simple as that.\n \n Thanks to electrolyte for saving me the time I was going to have to spend to searching this to back up my claim. \n\n \n Well believe it or not, saving time is somewhat of an issue for me too, especially since I have several opponents here. Since whatever electrolyte said impressed you far more than it did me, it only stands to reason that you would be able to find it far quicker than I can. How about doing me a favor and showing it to me - a post number or better yet, a copy/paste of the exact text you are referring to. I'll then address it, and take full responsibility for not making it clear enough earlier.\n \n \n \n \nYou pointed out clearly that mankind, at least in living memory, has never experienced anything like a worldwide flood, our accounts of it are every bit as verifiable and real as a Stephen King novel.\n \n \n What actual history do you have of the flood?

I think you know full well that the account of the flood is far closer to a Hollywood movie than watching footage of the planes crashing into the towers. There's no comparison, they're worlds apart. I know it, and you know it. \n\n \n So once history gets so old, it somehow drops out - it no longer actually happened? Scientific \"studies\" can go back billions of years, but what's written in history by humans has a time frame? \n \n \n \nWe can agree to disagree marc, but you have to realize that your position has been made untenable. You are standing pat on faith, not reason or logic.\n If you can accept that reality, then I have no problem agreeing to disagree. \n\n \n Sorry, you haven't proven that you know better than me how \"tender youths\" react to mtaphor's.\n \n \n \nTeaching kids the scientific method and providing them with an understanding of how the natural world around them works, is not telling them what to think or believe. It's providing them with the facts, and more importantly, the method for determining what is fact and what is not. Independent and critical thinking are most important things that any child should learn. Unfortunately, those things are the enemy of organized religion. \n\n \n Suppose a schoolteacher announces to a class that \"evolution is a fact\". First day of school, a little basic science summary with no mention of religion in any way. Then after class someone else asks each child; \"did your teacher imply that there was no God?\" I'd be surprised if almost all of them didn't say \"sure, that's exactly what he said. There's an evolution vs. creation viewpoint everywhere, isn't there?\"\n \n Now suppose school children were shown something comparable to this;\n \n \nDarwin's knowledge of cell complexity and bacterial flagellum were considerably less than what's known today. Let's compare his knowledge to a safe, with a combination dial of 39 numbers, and a three number, left-right-left combination. The probability of \"natural selection\" opening it would be one in 64,000. (40x40x40) Now let's compare today's knowledge of it with another safe with a more complicated mechanism; 99 numbers, and a five number combination left-right-left-right-left. (100x100x100x100x100) Rather than a 1 in 64,000 chance for evolution to work, it's now 1 in 10 billion. There is probably a greater difference in Darwin's knowledge and what we know today about cell complexity than there is in the two safe mechanisms - chances for evolution is probably even less than the difference between 64,000 and 10 billion. But it shows that the more complicated something is, the chances of it ramdomly happening decrease exponentially. \n\n \n Is this a method for determining what is fact and what is not? Is this independent and critical thinking? In light of the Dover school board having to pay a million dollars in court costs, or another school district being sued by the ACLU for putting stickers in textbooks telling students to study evolution with an open mind, if you're a school administrator do you allow students to be shown the amazing mathematical odds against (non creation) evolution without fear of being bankrupted by the ACLU? Is NOT TEACHING certain avenues of critical thinking good education?\n \n \n \n \nEvolution is completely comparable to the those things. It is a proven scientific hypothesis, supported by an overwhelming amount of scientific data. It is used as a tool every day, in the same ways, to provide the same types of advances for technology, medicine, etc...\n\n \n No one has explained to me how a non-creation / there is no God philosophy helps us to physically increase technology, medicine etc. (unless you're talking about stem cell research, cloning, rights to suicide, and all of that / moral, political issues)\n \n \nIf you want to get into philosophy, which is how you clearly want to view evolution, then I would agree, but we would no longer be discussing evolution. \n\n \n One time you say (non creation) evolution is perfectly comparable to other scientific tools, and one post later you call it philosophy, not evolution. Evolutionists manipulate it masterfully. \n \n \n \nThen you haven't opened your eyes and mind. They are all around you. \n\n \n Not on this forum.

It's intentionally dishonest, and I have no interest in continuing such a discussion.\n\n \n This from someone who, a year or so ago, said they'd love to \"have a go at me in the creation / evolution forum.\" \n \n When I first registered here, I saw the creation / evolution forum, and had no interest in it at all. It's gotten my attention little by little, and after getting involved in it, I find more and more shallowness in (non creation) evolution. There's more I'd like to explore. T.Q. claims to be \"done with me now\" (I can only hope) and his reason was my comparison of the words \"bang\" with \"explosion\". Apparantly this is a no no for evolution, something falls apart in evolution if the \"big bang\" was an explosion. emoticon_confused I wonder what it was. I also wonder about the term \"natural selection\". If something is selected, doesn't there have to be a selector? And the word \"purpose\". Can order come from no purpose?\n \n Does the English language pose a problem for evolution to the same degree as mathematical improbability?\n \n \n \n\"The religion of non-creation\".

   "Scientists want him to be perfect as much as Christians want Christ to be perfect, it seems.\n\n Your claims get more and more ludicrous. You obviously can't even provide examples to support this claim, but I'll save you the trouble by presenting evidence that proves you wrong:\n Despite Darwin's non-committal hypotheses regarding certain mechanisms of evolution, Gould made a big splash by presenting the idea of punctuated equilibria. The method for making it a big splash in the scientific community was to present it as contrary to Darwin's idea of gradualism.\n \n \nWell believe it or not, saving time is somewhat of an issue for me too, especially since I have several opponents here. Since whatever electrolyte said impressed you far more than it did me, it only stands to reason that you would be able to find it far quicker than I can. How about doing me a favor and showing it to me - a post number or better yet, a copy/paste of the exact text you are referring to. I'll then address it, and take full responsibility for not making it clear enough earlier.\n\n I'll save you both some time again. My first remarks in post 151:\n \nOf the scientists and engineers in the United States, only about 5% are creationists, according to a 1991 Gallup poll (Robinson 1995, Witham 1997). However, this number includes those working in fields not related to life origins (such as computer scientists, mechanical engineers, etc.). Taking into account only those working in the relevant fields of earth and life sciences, there are about 480,000 scientists, but only about 700 believe in \"creation-science\" or consider it a valid theory (Robinson 1995). This means that less than 0.15 percent of relevant scientists believe in creationism. And that is just in the United States, which has more creationists than any other industrialized country. In other countries, the number of relevant scientists who accept creationism drops to less than one tenth of 1 percent.\n (Source)\n\n \n The only reason this doesn't impress you, marc, is because you don't like it. But then, you ignore lots of things merely because you don't like them, don't you?\n \n \nScientific \"studies\" can go back billions of years, but what's written in history by humans has a time frame?\n\n Studies don't go back billions of years, but that which is studied can tell us about billions of years ago.\n Speaking of billions of years, I'm still waiting for your examples of \"what science tells us about what happened hundreds of trillions of centuries ago.\"\n \n \nSuppose a schoolteacher announces to a class that \"evolution is a fact\".\n\n Then the teacher would be correct.\n \n \nFirst day of school, a little basic science summary with no mention of religion in any way.\n\n Religion is out of place in the science classroom, so this is both appropriate and lawful.\n \n \nThen after class someone else asks each child; \"did your teacher imply that there was no God?\"\n\n Indoctrinated kiddies like ones marc would like to make every child into would scream, \"Yes, my teacher did!\"\n Unfortunately for marc, such a response only shows ignorance of the facts. If I explain atomic theory, or gravitational theory without appealing to a deity, am I teaching atheism? Of course not; your dualism is contrived.\n \n \nNow suppose school children were shown something comparable to this; [snip]\n\n Okay marc, since you have elected to repeat this drivel instead of first responding to my critique, I'll blast away.\n \n \nThe probability of \"natural selection\" opening it would be one in 64,000.\n\n As I have explained before, evolution is not random, it is selective. A random example is not representative of natural selection.\n Furthermore, biological systems are not all of the \"only one of many possible arrangements will work\" variety, so not even the analogy is valid.\n \n \nRather than a 1 in 64,000 chance for evolution to work, it's now 1 in 10 billion.\n\n Same problems.\n \n \nThere is probably a greater difference in Darwin's knowledge and what we know today about cell complexity than there is in the two safe mechanisms - chances for evolution is probably even less than the difference between 64,000 and 10 billion.\n\n Non-sequitur, because our knowledge has nothing to do with whether evolution occurs. In fact, the probability that evolution occurs is not very small; the probability that evolution occurs is one, because it does.\n \n \nIs this a method for determining what is fact and what is not?\n\n Not if it's full of fallacies and false analogies.\n \n \nIs this independent and critical thinking?\n\n Well, it certainly is independent, because nobody else is presenting such an inane argument, and it certainly is critical, but it is criticizing your strawman representation of evolution instead of what evolution actually is.\n \n \nIn light of the Dover school board having to pay a million dollars in court costs\n\n I already explained this one to you too, but you ignored it because you don't like it: The school had to pay the legal fees because the school board broke the law. This is typical legal convention.\n \n \nor another school district being sued by the ACLU for putting stickers in textbooks telling students to study evolution with an open mind\n\n Also as explained earlier, this is because the method by which the stickers were approved was unconstitutional.\n \n \nif you're a school administrator do you allow students to be shown the amazing mathematical odds against (non creation) evolution without fear of being bankrupted by the ACLU?\n\n You, marc, don't want teachers to show the mathematical odds of evolution, because then the students would know that the probability that evolution occurs is unity.\n \n \nIs NOT TEACHING certain avenues of critical thinking good education?\n\n Yes -- not teaching falsehoods and not presenting fallacious arguments is indeed good education. On the other hand, teaching valid avenues of critical thinking is good education.\n \n \nNo one has explained to me how a non-creation / there is no God philosophy helps us to physically increase technology, medicine etc. (unless you're talking about stem cell research, cloning, rights to suicide, and all of that / moral, political issues)\n\n marc is now out and out lying. There's no nice way to put this. He is bearing false witness. His lying has trapped him in yet another indefensible position. As I see it, he has two options:\n (1) He sticks with his assertion that evolution is a \"there is no God\" philosophy (which he has repeatedly refused to support), and he is lying because I provided him with a simple example of an application of evolutionary concepts that is an \"increase in medicine,\" creating vaccines.\n (2) He acknowledges my example of evolutionary concepts allowing us to create vaccines and explains this by acknowledging that evolution is not a \"there is no God\" philosophy, which shows that he has been lying about his view of evolution.\n Take your pick, marc.\n \n \n[quoting Waxy]\n If you want to get into philosophy, which is how you clearly want to view evolution, then I would agree, but we would no longer be discussing evolution.\n\n One time you say (non creation) evolution is perfectly comparable to other scientific tools, and one post later you call it philosophy, not evolution. Evolutionists manipulate it masterfully.\n\n marc, you are not reading what Waxy has said in context. Perhaps he will elaborate for you when (if?) he responds. If you want to get into the philosophy of science, that would be where to start. Last time I checked, though, you seemed a bit hesitant in the philosophy forum...\n Waxy, if I were you, I wouldn't bother; marc encouraged me to follow through on my offer to start a philosophy thread, and when I did, he ran.\n \n \nI'm constantly referred to \"theistic evolutionists\", but there doesn't seem to be a single one here.\n\n marc9000 is lying yet again. jyoshu claims to be a theistic evolutionist. In fact, marc has acknowledged this!\n \n \nApparantly this is a no no for evolution, something falls apart in evolution if the \"big bang\" was an explosion.\n\n marc lies again. He knows that cosmology and evolution are independent. (He also doesn't know the basics of the big bang theory.)\n \n \nI also wonder about the term \"natural selection\". If something is selected, doesn't there have to be a selector?\n\n Funny that marc ignores the word \"natural\"... It just goes to show that marc hasn't the slightest clue what he's talking about; if he doesn't even understand the concept of natual selection, how can we expect him to make educated analyses of-- oh, did I say \"educated\"? My mistake.\n \n \nDoes the English language pose a problem for evolution to the same degree as mathematical improbability?\n\n (That's a \"complex question,\" by the way.) Neither pose a problem for evolution.\n \n \nIt's a political opposition to religion.\n\n Support your assertion.\n \n \nDo you think children are sometimes NOT taught secular things, for political reasons?\n\n All the time! I call it \"church.\"\n \n \n\"All the information FROM BOTH SIDES\"? The flow of money favoring ONE SIDE is what scares me.\n\n Right. The evidence doesn't scare marc, because he ignores the evidence. It's the money thing, really; money is the reason that evolution occurs. The poor creationists don't get billions upon billions of dollars in tax-free donations that they could spend on scientific studies. Oh, wait...",

   "You believe there's no room for improvement in the checks and balances system? That it's already a wide open, unlimited, near perfect process? Nothing that science finds today comes close to questioning the 150 year old thoughts of Darwin? Scientists want him to be perfect as much as Christians want Christ to be perfect, it seems. \n\n \n There's always room for improvement marc.\n \n Science questions Darwin, and refines the details of his original theories on a daily basis. That's what science does. However, the essential nuts and bolts of the theory have been consistently proven correct. Everyone is questioned marc, Newton, Einstein, etc... are/were all questioned, but if the theory holds up to scrutiny, it's accepted until something better comes along. \n \n The part of your post I highlighted is utterly ridiculous, and you know it.\n \n \nIt's open to it I guess, but it's never been revised in thousands of years, so apparantly it's stood the test of human anaylsis pretty well. It is ignored more and more as time goes by (just as it predicts). Do you think today's generation is more qualified to analyze it than past generations? If today's generation is more qualified to analyze it's historical claims because of technology, is today's generation equally more qualified to analyze its moral and rules-for-behavior content? Have we made equal advances in human behavior knowledge as we have in nuts-and-bolts science? \n\n \n It has been revised and it's been through numerous translations.\n \n Furthermore, whether or not it's been revised is irrelevent to the point at hand.\n \n As to your questions, again they are largely irrelevent. I believe that the advances in science, and our increased understanding of historical events has cast a greater shadow of doubt on the Bible. However, people's ability to understand it as a spiritual/religious text is unaffected. \n \n \nAnd you don't? Others here don't?\n\n \n No, I don't. This is what you fail to understand. Evolution is not dogma. Evolution is the best available answer for the data. It is open to revision, it's is even able to be completely scrapped in favour of a new hypothesis. You'll likely jump on that as being a weakness, but that is it's greatest strength. Science, and evolution, are not tied to dogmatic faith, they are free to \"evolve\" as our knowledge increases.\n \n \nWell believe it or not, saving time is somewhat of an issue for me too, especially since I have several opponents here. Since whatever electrolyte said impressed you far more than it did me, it only stands to reason that you would be able to find it far quicker than I can. How about doing me a favor and showing it to me - a post number or better yet, a copy/paste of the exact text you are referring to. I'll then address it, and take full responsibility for not making it clear enough earlier.\n\n \n As originally posted by electrolyte.\n \n \nOf the scientists and engineers in the United States, only about 5% are creationists, according to a 1991 Gallup poll (Robinson 1995, Witham 1997). However, this number includes those working in fields not related to life origins (such as computer scientists, mechanical engineers, etc.). Taking into account only those working in the relevant fields of earth and life sciences, there are about 480,000 scientists, but only about 700 believe in \"creation-science\" or consider it a valid theory (Robinson 1995). This means that less than 0.15 percent of relevant scientists believe in creationism. And that is just in the United States, which has more creationists than any other industrialized country. In other countries, the number of relevant scientists who accept creationism drops to less than one tenth of 1 percent.\n (Source)\n \n So marc may have a point, for a change, if we try really hard to skew the stats. Notice that the (whopping) figure of 0.15% includes those who believe in \"creation-science\" or consider it a valid theory, regardless of whether they believe it. This means that it is possible that only a mere 99.85% of scientists who are from the creationist-laden United States and are working in relevant fields accept evolution. Of course, once we include all scientists worldwide who are working in relevant fields, Waxy's claim is true.\n \n Notice also that marc doesn't dispute that \"99.999999%\" of the data is in \n agreement.\n\n \n \nSo once history gets so old, it somehow drops out - it no longer actually happened? Scientific \"studies\" can go back billions of years, but what's written in history by humans has a time frame? \n\n \n You now respond with this assertion. I don't even know where to begin it's so ridiculous. You're moving the goalposts so far marc, we might as well be playing a different game.\n \n \nSuppose there are weather reports predicting a hurricane. The people are told that it will be just as severe as an actual hurricane 10 years ago where many people (friends of friends / relatives of relatives) were killed and injured. Then suppose there was no hurricane 10 years ago, but they were told that it would be just as severe as the one in a recent Stephen King book. Which is going to get their attention more, the thought of reliving an actual hurricane, or being told that a Stephen King story is going to come to life?\n \n \n Here's your initial post on this point of debate. This was followed up with several other posts during the exchange, including a reference to how watching the actual 9/11 footage was far more compelling than simply watching a made for TV movie on the subject.\n \n Your point in this entire exchange has been that living history, that within memory, that you can actually sense for yourself, either through witnessing it or a direct physical link (ie your civil war analogy) has a far greater effect on the human psyche than historical accounts or \"fictional\" stories.\n \n I clearly pointed out to you how that makes the biblical flood story fall into the latter category. When challenged to provide evidence to the contrary, you failed, suggesting instead that we agree to disagree.\n \n Science can study things that are billions of years old, but we can't go back billions of years. We can hypothesize as to what most likely happened.\n \n The time frame comes in directly with your assertion regarding the impact of historical accounts. You dug your own grave on that one.\n \n \nSorry, you haven't proven that you know better than me how \"tender youths\" react to mtaphor's.\n\n \n emoticon_confused \n \n marc, you're starting to becoming completely illogical. This doesn't follow at all.\n \n \nSuppose a schoolteacher announces to a class that \"evolution is a fact\". First day of school, a little basic science summary with no mention of religion in any way. Then after class someone else asks each child; \"did your teacher imply that there was no God?\" I'd be surprised if almost all of them didn't say \"sure, that's exactly what he said. There's an evolution vs. creation viewpoint everywhere, isn't there?\"\n\n \n That teacher would be slightly incorrect.\n \n Evolution is a theory, it's as close to being proven a fact as science can prove anything a fact.\n \n \nNow suppose school children were shown something comparable to this;\n\n \n Now suppose school children were taught that 2+2=5. \n \n I have no problem with the limits of our current understanding of evolution being explored, warts and all. In fact, it's critical. We need new minds exploring these areas to better our understanding.\n \n However, teaching false information, or simply plugging \"god\" into the gaps, has no place in a science classroom.\n \n \nIs this a method for determining what is fact and what is not? Is this independent and critical thinking? In light of the Dover school board having to pay a million dollars in court costs, or another school district being sued by the ACLU for putting stickers in textbooks telling students to study evolution with an open mind, if you're a school administrator do you allow students to be shown the amazing mathematical odds against (non creation) evolution without fear of being bankrupted by the ACLU? Is NOT TEACHING certain avenues of critical thinking good education?\n\n \n Marc, it has been pointed out to you repeatedly, that the Dover school district case was nothing out of the ordinary - it really is simple. You break the law, make an unconstitutional decision, then lose in court. It is standard for the loser to bear the burden of the legal fees. This was not vindictive, there was no conspiracy, it's simple the USA's legal sytem in action, no different from any case day in and day out. I know your skewed point of view will prevent you from ever accepting that as reality.\n \n As I said, evolution, warts and all, should be taught in school. \n \n You have not pointed out any alternative avenues of critical thinking that are not being taught. creationism and ID are not critical thinking, they are religious dogma and \"cleverly\" disguised religious dogma respectively. Neither involve critical thought.\n \n \nNo one has explained to me how a non-creation / there is no God philosophy helps us to physically increase technology, medicine etc. (unless you're talking about stem cell research, cloning, rights to suicide, and all of that / moral, political issues)\n\n \n ???????\n \n Several people have pointed out to you how evolution has been used to increase technology, medicince, etc....\n \n As for how a \"non-creation/there is no god philosophy\" affects things, your guess is as good as mine, because that would be irrelevent in a discussion of how evolution affects those things. As irrelevent as a \"non-creation/there is no god philosophy\" is to the theory of evolution itself.\n \n \nOne time you say (non creation) evolution is perfectly comparable to other scientific tools, and one post later you call it philosophy, not evolution. Evolutionists manipulate it masterfully. \n\n \n I didn't manipulate anything marc. You masterfully failed to comprehend a very simple point.\n \n \nNot on this forum. I'm constantly referred to \"theistic evolutionists\", but there doesn't seem to be a single one here.\n\n \n See jyoshu.\n \n \nThis from someone who, a year or so ago, said they'd love to \"have a go at me in the creation / evolution forum.\" \n\n \n This was before you proved yourself to be dishonest and intentionally ignorant of the issue.\n \n \nDoes the English language pose a problem for evolution to the same degree as mathematical improbability?\n\n \n Only when those who evolution is attempting to be explained to have no ability to comprehend it.\n \n \nIt's a political opposition to religion. You haven't opened your eyes and mind. It's all around you.\n\n \n It's a minority reaction to vast majority rule, and has very little to do with evolution.\n \n \nDo you think children are sometimes NOT taught secular things, for political reasons? \n\n \n This question makes no sense.\n \n \n\"All the information FROM BOTH SIDES\"? The flow of money favoring ONE SIDE is what scares me.\n\n \n This is farcical. The USA, right up to it's president and current governing political party are publicly religious. \n \n You've been proven wrong on the money issue already, why dredge up a loser?\n \n Waxy",

It simply comes down to this - I read it somewhere / don't remember who said it but it's quite true - (paraphrasing) If God is ruled out in advance, evolution can't lose; If God is given much consideration at all, evolution can't win. With the statistics we see, it's pretty clear God is ruled out in advance. \n \n Things tend to go full circle after a while, we'll see how it goes. A hundred years ago things were the other way around. Human nature tends to be rebellious, and that's largely what crowded the concept of creation/ID out of science/schools. Darwinism has been unable to address many of it's gaps for 150 years, and some people do notice. Scientists may not, but they don't have any more political power than the general population.\n \n \n \n \nAs to your questions, again they are largely irrelevent. \n\n \n No, they are very relevent. Most people decide whether or not they want to believe the historical accounts of the Bible long before they see any scientific analyzations of it. It's a result of not wanting to follow it's morality and rules for behavior. It's easy to see that most who make no attempt to follow it's morality and rules also don't believe in it's historical content.\n \n \n I believe that the advances in science, and our increased understanding of historical events has cast a greater shadow of doubt on the Bible. However, people's ability to understand it as a spiritual/religious text is unaffected. \n\n \n If doubt is cast on it's historical events, doubt is cast on the rest of it. From one of your past posts, I believe we can agree that it only has one author (God). If you're reading a book by....Rush Limbaugh :p and found something you firmly believed to be false, would that make you trust the rest of the book the same, or less?\n \n With God ruled out in advance, science can pretty easily make some impressive claims about what happened in the past. Who can refute it - who can prove or disprove it? How can science claim to be 100% neutral, when neutrality could be a tremendous political upset to past work? \n \n \n \n \nNo, I don't. This is what you fail to understand. Evolution is not dogma. Evolution is the best available answer for the data. It is open to revision, it's is even able to be completely scrapped in favour of a new hypothesis. You'll likely jump on that as being a weakness, but that is it's greatest strength. Science, and evolution, are not tied to dogmatic faith, they are free to \"evolve\" as our knowledge increases. \n\n \n Evolution is dogma. It is a worldview, a belief in non creation. Entire lifestyles are built around it. If there was no creator, then humans have no eternal soul, and were not \"endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights\". \n \n \n \n \nAs originally posted by electrolyte.\n\n \n So the 99% figure does apply to scientists, but it doesn't apply to the second part of my statement, a \"single political controversy today\". And scientists don't have any special privilidges in U.S. politics. \n \n \n \n \nYou now respond with this assertion. I don't even know where to begin it's so ridiculous. You're moving the goalposts so far marc, we might as well be playing a different game.\n\n \n Here's what you said;\n \nMarc, I know you're stubborn as hell, but I also think you're fairly intelligent. I think you know full well that the account of the flood is far closer to a Hollywood movie than watching footage of the planes crashing into the towers. There's no comparison, they're worlds apart. I know it, and you know it. \n\n \n What is the difference, if they both happened? I've seen disaster movies, that were surprisingly similar to watching footage of the planes / towers. I'm not moving the goalposts at all - there is a human tendency to disregard history as it gets older and older. Just because it's old seldom means it loses it's significance.\n \n \n \n \n \nHere's your initial post on this point of debate. This was followed up with several other posts during the exchange, including a reference to how watching the actual 9/11 footage was far more compelling than simply watching a made for TV movie on the subject.\n \n Your point in this entire exchange has been that living history, that within memory, that you can actually sense for yourself, either through witnessing it or a direct physical link (ie your civil war analogy) has a far greater effect on the human psyche than historical accounts or \"fictional\" stories. \n\n \n And that's a FLAW in the human psyche. Maybe that's where our difference is. I think history is important for learning how to behave no matter how old it is. You seem to be saying that it loses it's significance over time.\n \n \nI clearly pointed out to you how that makes the biblical flood story fall into the latter category. When challenged to provide evidence to the contrary, you failed, suggesting instead that we agree to disagree. \n\n \n You said this;\n \nThank you for making my point for me, and beautifully at that, I love the Stephen King reference.\n \n Has anyone alive ever experienced a world wide flood? \n \n Huh, kinda hard to relate to it any more than that Stephen King book then isn't it?\n \n The flood loses no effect as a metaphor, even to tender youths. \n\n \n You didn't clearly point out anything, and you didn't challange me to do anything. I said we should agree to disagree how much the flood loses it's effect as a metaphor, even to tender youths. \n \n \n \nScience can study things that are billions of years old, but we can't go back billions of years. We can hypothesize as to what most likely happened. \n\n \n And science often \"hypothesizes\" how much it can \"hypothesize\". Since we've established that those who represent science (99.9%) have a far different worldview than the general population (far less than 50%, concerning creation) their \"hypothesis\" need to be subject to political scruntity.\n \n \nThe time frame comes in directly with your assertion regarding the impact of historical accounts. You dug your own grave on that one.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean there, but I think I covered it above - that actual reaction and necessary reaction to historical events are two differnt things.\n \n \n \nemoticon_confused \n \n marc, you're starting to becoming completely illogical. This doesn't follow at all. \n\n \n See above, it goes back to what I suggested we agree to disagree on. It wasn't about what catagory the Biblical flood fell in, it was about how metaphor's effect tender youths. \n \n \n \nThat teacher would be slightly incorrect. \n\n \n Slightly, yes. You haven't noticed how that phrase is repeated over and over on this forum, and many other places as well? It's another flaw in human behavior, especially children. When something is repeated over and over enough, it's less likely to be questioned. Richard Dawkins has said it.\n \n \nEvolution is a theory, it's as close to being proven a fact as science can prove anything a fact. \n\n \n Considering the stark contrast in scientists worldviews vs. the general population's worldviews, close ain't good enough. \n \n \n \nI have no problem with the limits of our current understanding of evolution being explored, warts and all. In fact, it's critical. We need new minds exploring these areas to better our understanding.\n \n However, teaching false information, or simply plugging \"god\" into the gaps, has no place in a science classroom.\n\n \n Are teaching mathematical improbablilities \"false information\"? How about this one; Bacterial flagellum is a bidirectional motor driven propeller that moves certain bacteria through their watery environment. Humans designed motor driven propellers long before they figured out that the flagellum was such a machine. Interesting eh? So the fact is that evolution claims that bacterial flagellum evolved, and something at least remotely similar (19th century boat props) were designed by man. Would simply pointing this out to students, using the horrible word \"designed\" to describe it, bring on an ACLU lawsuit? Please don't tell me I'm being silly - people living in the 1950's would have rolled in the floor laughing at the very thought of a court case like Dover being decided like it just was, considering people in the 50's just witnessed \"In God we trust\" being inscribed on their money.\n \n \n \nMarc, it has been pointed out to you repeatedly, that the Dover school district case was nothing out of the ordinary - it really is simple. You break the law, make an unconstitutional decision, then lose in court. It is standard for the loser to bear the burden of the legal fees. This was not vindictive, there was no conspiracy, it's simple the USA's legal sytem in action, no different from any case day in and day out. I know your skewed point of view will prevent you from ever accepting that as reality. \n\n \n Let's look at Jones skewed point of view, shall we?\n \n \nI can never see what is taking place in my courtroom before I emerge from chambers and take the bench, so I wondered what I would find. Well, when I emerged and as I walked up to take my seat on the first day of the Dover trial, I saw something that I had never seen before in my judicial career. I saw a courtroom packed wall-to-wall with high-tech gear, lawyers, parties, spectators, United States marshals, and a number of sketch artists. The sight of all this almost took my breath away. In fact, it took me a few moments to compose myself as the trial started. I had never seen anything like it. \n\n \n Just another day? It was a circus. Why? A little word called politics.\n \n This is the summary that makes my point; he was responding to critics of his decision.\n \n time and again writers would omit to note the role legal precedents play as they relates how judges decide cases that come before them. That is, as a trial judge, I must follow the law as previously established by the higher courts and in particular by the Supreme Court of the United States. \n\n \n http://www.adl.org/Civil_Rights/speech_judge_jones.asp\n \n He referred to previous courts a lot more than he did to the U.S. Constitution and the intent of it's framers. It's called snowballing judicial activism. It's a slippery slope, and it's true, no matter what all the fallacy list authors say.\n \n \n \nAs I said, evolution, warts and all, should be taught in school. \n \n You have not pointed out any alternative avenues of critical thinking that are not being taught. creationism and ID are not critical thinking, they are religious dogma and \"cleverly\" disguised religious dogma respectively. Neither involve critical thought. \n\n \n Just because you haven't heard of it, doens't mean it doesn't exist.\n \n http://www.leaderu.com/offices/dembski/docs/bd-specified.html\n \n \n \n???????\n \n Several people have pointed out to you how evolution has been used to increase technology, medicince, etc....\n\n \n They've merely stated it, they've shown no details whatsoever.\n \n \nAs for how a \"non-creation/there is no god philosophy\" affects things, your guess is as good as mine, because that would be irrelevent in a discussion of how evolution affects those things. As irrelevent as a \"non-creation/there is no god philosophy\" is to the theory of evolution itself. \n\n \n Everybody has a worldview, my guess is that money is being followed. My references to electrolyte about the BSCS showed it very well. \n \n \n \nSee jyoshu.\n\n \n I've seen him - if you'll check back, you'll see that he doesn't want to discuss it. That's fine, this doesn't seem to be his place of interest, but the fact remains that there doesn't seem to be a theistic evolutionist here that wants to explain how one can be a Christian and not be a creationist. There was one other here who claimed to be a theistic evolutionist, (I don't remember the name) but he seems to have disappeared.\n \n \n \nOnly when those who evolution is attempting to be explained to have no ability to comprehend it. \n\n \n Do you want to discuss some word meanings? \"Natural selection\" is one of those terms I was talking about that has been repeated long enough that no one seems to question it. Again, can a selection be made without a selector?\n \n \n \n \nThis question makes no sense. \n\n \n Well check this out - this shows how a \"scientific\" website seems to pick and choose what to say.\n \n \nThe focus of this article is on those deceptions invoked by the TO writers, which are mostly achieved by omissions, as is demonstrated in the illustrations below. It is often what the people at TO do not say that makes TO a propaganda/indoctrination site as opposed to an educational site. \n\n \n You may want to skim through another paragraph or two there.\n \n http://www.trueorigin.org/to_deception.asp\n \n \n \nThis is farcical. The USA, right up to it's president and current governing political party are publicly religious. \n\n \n The president and current governing party can not even scratch the surface concerning 80 years of political action by the ACLU, almost 50 years by the BSCS, and countless activist court decisions.\n \n \nYou've been proven wrong on the money issue already, why dredge up a loser?\n \n Waxy\n\n \n Proven wrong on the money issue?

   "No, it's not ridiculous at all. It simply comes down to this - I read it somewhere / don't remember who said it but it's quite true - (paraphrasing) If God is ruled out in advance, evolution can't lose; If God is given much consideration at all, evolution can't win. With the statistics we see, it's pretty clear God is ruled out in advance. \n\n \n Your thinking and debating is so non-linear it's nearly impossible to continue.\n \n Can you please explain to me how this response in any way relates to my post, and in particular, the ridiculousness of this statement or yours \n \n \nScientists want him to be perfect as much as Christians want Christ to be perfect, it seems\n\n \n \nThings tend to go full circle after a while, we'll see how it goes. A hundred years ago things were the other way around. Human nature tends to be rebellious, and that's largely what crowded the concept of creation/ID out of science/schools. Darwinism has been unable to address many of it's gaps for 150 years, and some people do notice. Scientists may not, but they don't have any more political power than the general population.\n\n \n emoticon_frazzled emoticon_wow emoticon_confused :xbanghead \n \n WHAT??????? Hasn't that been the very premise of your arguments from the beginning? The massive scientist (atheist, they're interchangeable in your world) conspiracy to take over politics and destroy the morality of the USA?\n \n \nNo, they are very relevent. Most people decide whether or not they want to believe the historical accounts of the Bible long before they see any scientific analyzations of it. It's a result of not wanting to follow it's morality and rules for behavior. It's easy to see that most who make no attempt to follow it's morality and rules also don't believe in it's historical content.\n\n \n If by most people, you mean children. I agree. Then those children are educated (indoctrinated emoticon_rolleyes ) and make decisions for themselves.\n \n Now you've stepped into a VERY broad generalization that not only can you not support, but that tends to get my blood boiling. Check the Female Clergy thread in the religion section for a discussion on morals and behaviour regarding Christianity.\n \n This one is a non-starter, unless your desire is simply to infuriate others.\n \n \nIf doubt is cast on it's historical events, doubt is cast on the rest of it. From one of your past posts, I believe we can agree that it only has one author (God). If you're reading a book by....Rush Limbaugh :p and found something you firmly believed to be false, would that make you trust the rest of the book the same, or less?\n\n \n It would make me trust the book the same, as I read all books with a critical mind. Only a fool, or someone operating on blind faith takes everything he reads or sees on TV as truth.\n \n \nWith God ruled out in advance, science can pretty easily make some impressive claims about what happened in the past. Who can refute it - who can prove or disprove it? How can science claim to be 100% neutral, when neutrality could be a tremendous political upset to past work? \n\n \n God is irrelevent to science. That's been pointed out to you repeatedly. God or no God is not a premise in science. The best explanation to the data available is the goal. God will never be ruled out by science, science will simply favour the most probable, repeatable, and testable answer. I will agree with you that that's rarely if ever \"god\".\n \n \nEvolution is dogma. It is a worldview, a belief in non creation. Entire lifestyles are built around it. If there was no creator, then humans have no eternal soul, and were not \"endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights\". \n\n \n I can see we'll never get past this, so I'm going to quit banging my head against the wall. This is the last time I will address this.\n \n Evolution is a scientific theory that describes how life on the planet adapts and changes with time. It doesn't even rule out god, it simply favours a different, and better, answer. It's not a worldview, it's not dogma, people don't build their lives around it.\n \n It has nothing to do with unalienable rights, souls or any other unrelated topic you care to throw into the conspiracy bag.\n \n \nSo the 99% figure does apply to scientists, but it doesn't apply to the second part of my statement, a \"single political controversy today\". And scientists don't have any special privilidges in U.S. politics. \n\n \n But evil atheistic scientists have massive political influence remember?\n \n Squirm all you want marc, it makes no difference. Apparently, you are unable to gracefully admit defeat on any point.\n \n \nWhat is the difference, if they both happened? I've seen disaster movies, that were surprisingly similar to watching footage of the planes / towers. I'm not moving the goalposts at all - there is a human tendency to disregard history as it gets older and older. Just because it's old seldom means it loses it's significance.\n \n And that's a FLAW in the human psyche. Maybe that's where our difference is. I think history is important for learning how to behave no matter how old it is. You seem to be saying that it loses it's significance over time.\n \n\n \n I can't keep playing these games with you. You constantly shift your meaning from post to post as it suits you. It's called dishonesty.\n \n So you mean to tell me then, that wars fought by ancient tribes thousands of years ago have the same affect on you as having your father fight in WWII or your son in Iraq? Is that your point regarding how the period of time involving history affects it's significance now? Because it wasn't before, in fact, it's the opposite of what you initially asserted.\n \n Face it marc, tales of a war fought by the ancient Aztecs don't have the impact of direct involvement in such a war. \n \n My point all along has been, and still is, that the flood story is so fantastic in nature, with nothing even remotely similar that anyone can directly or indirectly relate to, that's it's strength as an actual historical event, (a warning to all regarding their behaviour as you see it) is very minimal. People cannot relate to it in a fashion beyond how they would react to a Hollywood movie about volcanoes erupting and destroying the world. It's science fiction/bad disaster movie stuff.\n \n The metaphor of the flood - destruction of the world - is the real key behind the story. How exactly the world was destroyed is pretty much irrelevent.\n \n \nYou didn't clearly point out anything, and you didn't challange me to do anything. \n\n \n I don't know how to make it any clearer.\n \n \nAnd science often \"hypothesizes\" how much it can \"hypothesize\". Since we've established that those who represent science (99.9%) have a far different worldview than the general population (far less than 50%, concerning creation) their \"hypothesis\" need to be subject to political scruntity.\n\n \n The creation number you present is skewed, only a relatively small percentage of that number are true young earth or literal creationists. I've seen the data, I'll see if I can dig it up.\n \n The power of education shouldn't be underestimated.\n \n \nConsidering the stark contrast in scientists worldviews vs. the general population's worldviews, close ain't good enough. \n\n \n See above.\n \n As I've said before, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. All science can do is present the facts, it's up to the individual whether or not they choose to accept them or stick to their faith.\n \n The power of faith generally trumps the power of education. \n \n \nAre teaching mathematical improbablilities \"false information\"? How about this one; Bacterial flagellum is a bidirectional motor driven propeller that moves certain bacteria through their watery environment. Humans designed motor driven propellers long before they figured out that the flagellum was such a machine. Interesting eh? So the fact is that evolution claims that bacterial flagellum evolved, and something at least remotely similar (19th century boat props) were designed by man. Would simply pointing this out to students, using the horrible word \"designed\" to describe it, bring on an ACLU lawsuit? Please don't tell me I'm being silly - people living in the 1950's would have rolled in the floor laughing at the very thought of a court case like Dover being decided like it just was, considering people in the 50's just witnessed \"In God we trust\" being inscribed on their money.\n\n \n This argument is so ridiculous I have a hard time believing that you see it as evidence for your position.\n \n It's not interesting in the least, not to mention utterly pointless.\n \n You're being silly.\n \n \nLet's look at Jones skewed point of view, shall we?\n \n Just another day? It was a circus. Why? A little word called politics.\n \n This is the summary that makes my point; he was responding to critics of his decision.\n \n http://www.adl.org/Civil_Rights/speech_judge_jones.asp\n \n He referred to previous courts a lot more than he did to the U.S. Constitution and the intent of it's framers. It's called snowballing judicial activism. It's a slippery slope, and it's true, no matter what all the fallacy list authors say.\n\n \n I'm not in the least bit interested in this discussion.\n \n \nJust because you haven't heard of it, doens't mean it doesn't exist.\n \n http://www.leaderu.com/offices/dembski/docs/bd-specified.html\n\n \n Remember your point about constant repetition of something in hopes of getting people to believe it's true?\n \n This has all been refuted. Repeatedly. Yet you still cling to it.\n \n \nThey've merely stated it, they've shown no details whatsoever.\n\n \n Would the details mean anything to you? Is a detailed discourse what you're after? I have an MSc., and I would not understand the details of the biology and biochemistry involved in a full explanation.\n \n Look it up if you want the details. Laziness is no excuse for ignorance.\n \n \nEverybody has a worldview, my guess is that money is being followed. My references to electrolyte about the BSCS showed it very well. \n\n \n I sure wish I got paid for being agnostic. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nI've seen him - if you'll check back, you'll see that he doesn't want to discuss it. That's fine, this doesn't seem to be his place of interest, but the fact remains that there doesn't seem to be a theistic evolutionist here that wants to explain how one can be a Christian and not be a creationist. There was one other here who claimed to be a theistic evolutionist, (I don't remember the name) but he seems to have disappeared.\n\n \n How many millions of members does the Roman Catholic Church have? The fact that there are none here doesn't change the reality. It just means that none post here.\n \n \nDo you want to discuss some word meanings? \"Natural selection\" is one of those terms I was talking about that has been repeated long enough that no one seems to question it. Again, can a selection be made without a selector?\n\n \n LOL. Can God make a rock so big that even he can't lift it?\n \n The environment is the selector - it doesn't require consciousness or intelligence. This is so basic as to be pathetic. \n \n \nThe president and current governing party can not even scratch the surface concerning 80 years of political action by the ACLU, almost 50 years by the BSCS, and countless activist court decisions.\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n With equal influence asserted in the courts by the Christian side in those 80 years, not to mention the 200-300 years before that.\n \n \nProven wrong on the money issue?

That's what science does. However, the essential nuts and bolts of the theory have been consistently proven correct. Everyone is questioned marc, Newton, Einstein, etc... are/were all questioned, but if the theory holds up to scrutiny, it's accepted until something better comes along. \n \n The part of your post I highlighted is utterly ridiculous, and you know it. \n\n \n Science is not permitted to be held up to any branch of scientific thinking that stems from the possibility of creation, like specified complexity, designed systems, etc.\n \n \n [Kenneth] Miller has conceded that Behe's irreducible complexity argument is testable. And we see that Miller's assertion that scientists have tested and falsified Behe's argument is itself false. Finally, Behe and other design theorists like Scott Minnich and Stephen Meyer have offered positive evidence for the design of the flagellum based on standard uniformitarian reasoning, reasoning well established in science. \n\n \n http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01/intelligent_design_is_empirica.html#more\n \n The statement I paraphrased was from Phillip Johnson. I'm sure you're impressed, but focus on each word of what he says;\n \n \nVictory in the creation-evolution dispute ultimately belongs to the party with the cultural authority to establish the ground rules that govern the discourse. If creation is admitted as a serious possibility, Darwinism cannot win; and if creation is excluded a priori, Darwinism cannot lose. The point is illustrated in the logic employed by the National Academy of Sciences to persuade the Supreme Court that \"creation scientists\" should not be given an opportunity to present their case against the theory of evolution in science classes. \n\n \n Can you now understand now how it relates to your post? A branch of science, uniformitarian reasoning, is disregarded in the questioning process that you assert. I wonder just how much political power the National Academy of Sciences wields. While Albert Einstien was not exactly a religious man, he is quoted as saying this;\n \n \n I am not interested in this phenomenon or that phenomenon. I want to know God's thoughts - the rest are mere details.\" He said he believed in a God \"who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists.\" \n\n \n One thing's for sure, if he were alive today, he wouldn't be involved in public schools. Judge John Jones would throw him out on his ear.\n \n \n \nemoticon_frazzled emoticon_wow emoticon_confused :xbanghead \n \n WHAT???????

I'll work on my end, will you work on yours? emoticon_xangel \n \n Scientists SHOULD not have any more political power than the general population (according to the U.S. foundations) but scientists can use the courts to help themselves to it, if the general population have their heads burried deeply in the sand. If the general population WAKES UP, (as in the word \"rebellious\" from my previous post) political trends can be reversed. One or two more cases similar to the Dover trial could do just that. \n \n \n \n \nIf by most people, you mean children. I agree. \n\n \n I do, for the most part.\n \n \nThen those children are educated (indoctrinated emoticon_rolleyes ) and make decisions for themselves.\n\n \n If only it were that simple. Their worldview is basically established by age 12 or 13, (to what exact degree is debatable - not important here) and then a little thing called puberty strikes, and to what extent they've been indoctrinated can largely determine what course their worldview will take.\n \n \nNow you've stepped into a VERY broad generalization that not only can you not support, but that tends to get my blood boiling. Check the Female Clergy thread in the religion section for a discussion on morals and behaviour regarding Christianity. \n\n \n Well, it started out about females, and it's 13 pages long. Could you be a little more specific, maybe narrow it down to.....5 or 6 posts that you feel are the most relevant?\n \n \nThis one is a non-starter, unless your desire is simply to infuriate others. \n\n \n That's not my desire. But differences in worldviews concerning U.S. politics are not pretty. \n \n \n \nIt would make me trust the book the same, as I read all books with a critical mind. Only a fool, or someone operating on blind faith takes everything he reads or sees on TV as truth. \n\n \n You're swerving away from my point. My point was that if a source is proven wrong in one respect, it should be more subject to scruntity in other respects. If it would make you \"trust the book the same\", then there can only be two possiblities; 1) You don't believe much of ANYTHING unless you can physically sense it, or; 2) A red flag doesn't go up for you if a source lies to you. IMHO those are both common sense problems.\n \n \n \n \nGod is irrelevent to science. That's been pointed out to you repeatedly. God or no God is not a premise in science.

God is a premise in science in a negative way, and I've proved it repeatedly. By out-of-the-blue put downs of creationism in threads in this forum, in news articles about \"evolution\" and in statements made by those prominent in science. It doesn't matter if constant put-downs of creation are true or false - they are projected by, and taken in by, imperfect humans. The \"Scientific American\" magazine has MOCKED creation in it's editorials - the NY Times has MOCKED creation in it's editorials. It permeates deeply all through society today. \n \n The biggest proof of it isn't what's done intentionally, it's laid bare when a handful of prominent representatives of science SCREW UP and inadvertently tell the truth.\n \n \nWe take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs, in spite of its failure to fulfill many of its extravagant promises of health and life, in spite of the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just-so stories, because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counterintuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine foot in the door.\"\n \n Richard Lewontin, Billions and billions of demons, The New York Review, p. 31, 9 January 1997. \n \n \n \"I think that philosophically that one should be sensitive to what I think history shows, namely, that evolution, just as much as religion -- or at least, leave \"just as much,\" let me leave that phrase -- evolution, akin to religion, involves making certain a priori or metaphysical assumptions, which at some level cannot be proven empirically. I guess we all knew that, but I think that we're all much more sensitive to these facts now. And I think that the way to deal with creationism, but the way to deal with evolution also, is not to deny these facts, but to recognize them, and to see where we can go, as we move on from there. \" Michael Ruse Speech at 'The New Antievolutionism' symposium February 13,1993 \n \n \"Evolution is the greatest engine of atheism ever invented. Naturalistic evolution has clear consequences that Charles Darwin understood perfectly. 1) No gods worth having exist; 2) no life after death exists; 3) no ultimate foundation for ethics exists; 4) no ultimate meaning in life exists; and 5) human free will is nonexistent.\" William Provine \"Evolution: Free will and punishment and meaning in life\" 1998 Darwin Day Keynote Address \n\n \n This one is from one of electrolyte's \"neutral\" administrators at talkorigins;\n \nCreationists lie. They always lie, they lie worse than politicians, they lie worse than used car salesmen, they lie when their argument is weakened by a lie. The entire story you presented was a lie. There was no instance in which a body wearing modern shoes was ever sampled for C14 dating. Are we supposed to be so stupid that we are to believe that after a radiocarbon sample is submitted, the carcass was just suddenly revealed to be wearing shoes? A body is not just \"found\" to be wearing shoes. Is anyone this stupid? I question that this story has any factual basis at all. Is this a teacher? Was there a student? \n\n \n While that was a response to just one question, we see that he paints ALL creationists with the same brush, don't we? I could spend a little more time giving several pages of more examples, but it wouldn't make much difference, would it?\n \n \n \nI can see we'll never get past this, so I'm going to quit banging my head against the wall.

How exactly the world was destroyed is pretty much irrelevent.\n\n \n It's irrelevant to the atheist worldview. Time alone should not be an issue when determining how important a historical event was. Human nature tends to make us disregard history because ofr it's age. The circumstances of ancient wars / aztec indians, etc. should be the only determining factors concerning how significant they are, not time. A non atheist worldview may consider the flood to be more significant than you do, since the Bible compares it to a future event. And many future events the Bible predicted are coming true. \n \n \n \nThe creation number you present is skewed, only a relatively small percentage of that number are true young earth or literal creationists. I've seen the data, I'll see if I can dig it up. \n\n \n It's not critical, I was just roughly going by electrolyte's statistics that you championed. The important part is that scientists worldviews differ significantly from the general population.\n \n \nThe power of education shouldn't be underestimated.\n\n \n Is science the only source of education? The power of other subjects shouldn't be underestimated either. When science conflicts with one of them, someone besides the scientific community should determine which subject is straying out of it's bounds. \n \n \n \nAs I've said before, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. All science can do is present the facts, it's up to the individual whether or not they choose to accept them or stick to their faith.\n \n The power of faith generally trumps the power of education. \n\n \n It sure does, especially when it comes to the faithful way science covers all of it's secular gaps. \n \n \n \nThis argument is so ridiculous I have a hard time believing that you see it as evidence for your position.\n \n It's not interesting in the least, not to mention utterly pointless.\n \n You're being silly. \n\n \n I asked you not to tell me that! emoticon_mad :) \n \n You really don't think that's interesting, that man would design something similar to a complex natural existance, many decades before the natural thing was discovered? It's interesting to me how much the atheistic worldview is the absolute opposite of \"freethought\".\n \n \n \nI'm not in the least bit interested in this discussion. \n\n \n Possibly because you're not from the U.S. and that's okay. When I similarily brought up GazzaElliott's not being from the U.S. he seemed to take some offense to it, and that's not the way I intended it. I can't expect you guys to take the same interest in some of the details of U.S. politics any more than you can with me, concerning your country's political details. You joined this discussion however, and that Dover court case is huge concerning it.\n \n \n \n \nRemember your point about constant repetition of something in hopes of getting people to believe it's true?\n\n \n Yes, I do. That's the first time I've posted that link, and I've never noticed \"specified complexity\" discussed in depth here. \n \n \nThis has all been refuted. Repeatedly. Yet you still cling to it.\n\n \n On these forums? In a concise way? With no personal attacks on William Dembski? How about a link?\n \n \n \nWould the details mean anything to you?

The fact that there are none here doesn't change the reality. It just means that none post here.\n\n \n You're implying that the entire Roman Catholic Church rejects creation? And you call me dishonest?\n \n \n \nLOL. Can God make a rock so big that even he can't lift it? \n\n \n Take some advise from another atheist;\n \nWhat flavor is Thursday?\n \n Do bananas enjoy driving tractors?\n \n Those who enter into \"battle\" with a Christian, wielding the Rock argument as their only weapon, are going to about as successful as the naive young evangelist who thinks all he need do is say \"Jesus loves you\", and atheists will convert and rush to the nearest church like lemmings. \n \n It's probably unusual for an atheist to criticise a commonly-used argument against God, but I really don't think the Rock problem is a valuable addition to our arsenal except maybe as a counter to the \"God can do whatever the heck he likes\" assertion. \n \n If an omnipotent God exists, then it can do anything, as long as that action is logically possible. \n\n \n \n \nThe environment is the selector - it doesn't require consciousness or intelligence. This is so basic as to be pathetic. \n\n \n It's basic to atheism, but not to logic or reason.\n \n \nse\u00b7lect ( P ) Pronunciation Key (s-lkt)\n v. se\u00b7lect\u00b7ed, se\u00b7lect\u00b7ing, se\u00b7lects \n v. tr.\n To take as a choice from among several; pick out.\n \n v. intr.\n To make a choice or selection.\n \n adj. \n Singled out in preference; chosen: a select few. \n Of special quality or value; choice: select peaches. \n Of or relating to a lean grade of beef. \n Careful or refined in making selections; discriminating. \n\n \n If something is taken, if a choice is made, if something is picked out, there is a consious motivation to do it - there is a purpose.

   "God is relevant to science in a negative way. God is a premise in science in a negative way, and I've proved it repeatedly.\n\n marc lies. He lies often. See my previous posts to see my proof of his lying.\n \n \nThis one is from one of electrolyte's \"neutral\" administrators at talkorigins;\n\n Talkorigins doesn't claim to be neutral. If marc had read the article I linked to, he would have seen that the TO mission statement is to provide the mainstream scientific view, not a \"neutral\" presentation of evolution vs. creationism. While TO is religiously neutral, there is nothing wrong with pointing out that creationists lie, as demonstrated so wonderfully on this board by marc himself.\n \n \nA non atheist worldview may consider the flood to be more significant than you do, since the Bible compares it to a future event.\n\n One would have to believe in the fairy tale that is the flood in order to believe that it's significant.\n \n \nAnd many future events the Bible predicted are coming true.\n\n If you can prove that any Biblical prophecy has been fulfilled, you should contact the many organizations that provide cash rewards for such proofs. Otherwise, quit lying.\n \n \nI've proved that it does.\n\n It's funny that when several of my (or Waxy's, or pandion's, or Collin's, or countless others') lines of argument go unrebutted, they are ignored by marc, but when he presents a lousy argument that gets shredded, it's \"proof.\"\n In other words, marc is lying yet again.\n \n \nThe important part is that scientists worldviews differ significantly from the general population.\n\n If marc actually meant this, he'd recognize that many scientists are theists and even Christian; instead, he still denies that evolution isn't atheistic. Regardless, though, in general scientists' views on evolution are rather one-sided, and they are more qualified that \"the general population\" to weigh the evidence.\n \n \nIs science the only source of education?\n\n No, but it's one of the very few reliable sources. It's worlds better than a big book full of contradictions, absurdities, atrocities, and falsehoods.\n \n \nIt sure does, especially when it comes to the faithful way science covers all of it's secular gaps.\n\n Already refuted. Quit lying.\n \n \nYou really don't think that's interesting, that man would design something similar to a complex natural existance, many decades before the natural thing was discovered?\n\n So you're arguing that nature is great at eliciting functional systems via evolutionary processes? I agree!\n \n \nYes, I do. That's the first time I've posted that link, and I've never noticed \"specified complexity\" discussed in depth here.\n\n It's not worth a deep discussion. First, it relies upon a fallacy (the argument from (im)probability); second, it is dependent upon irreducible complexity (as Dembski himself has explained). Therefore, it's fallacious, and its underpinning has been disproved.\n \n \nOn these forums? In a concise way? With no personal attacks on William Dembski? How about a link?\n\n I provided you with a link to the post \"The Death of Irreducible Complexity,\" where Dembski got up and BSed the entire ID movement into a death trap. In that very thread, Dembski himself comes in and tries to salvage his BS, but he only digs the hole deeper, and Hoppe calls him on it. That is, Dembski makes himself look foolish all by himself.\n \n \nI'm wondering why an atheist somehow has greater access to chemicals that exist on earth today more than a Christian scientist would.\n\n There you go again, admitting again that you don't even believe the lies you present. According to you, there's no such thing as a \"Christian scientist.\"\n \n \nYou're implying that the entire Roman Catholic Church rejects creation? And you call me dishonest?\n\n You're not aware of JPII's proclamation, are you? Or his scientific advisors' releases? You're the one who is ignorant of the subject matter.\n \n \nIf something is taken, if a choice is made, if something is picked out, there is a consious motivation to do it - there is a purpose. In other secular, scientific changes we see and study, we don't see purpose.\n\n There is no \"purpose\" of selection; it's natural process. Just as \"making things fall\" is not a \"purpose\" of gravity, gravity simply makes things fall.\n \n \nse\u00b7lec\u00b7tion n.\n 1.\n 1. The act or an instance of selecting or the fact of having been selected.\n 2. One that is selected.\n 2. A carefully chosen or representative collection of people or things.

A natural or artificial process that favors or induces survival and perpetuation of one kind of organism over others that die or fail to produce offspring.\n\n Ho-hum.\n \n \nThe Christian side tends to maintain the text of the Constitution and intent of the framers, because most of it favors originalism.\n\n Then why do so many on the Christian side encourage ignoring the intent of the Framers to keep religion and goverment separate? After all, since the Constitution doesn't mention the Christian God, doesn't that make it atheistic? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nAnd you didn't reference it - no surprises there, since all electrolyte did was show his lack of knowledge between public and private funding.\n\n marc lies yet again: I provided him with examples of public funding that were not \"politically motivated,\" and he responded to only one with some rubbish about how important drugs were only needed because of the sinful nature of man...",

   "Electrolyte has pretty much covered this, and quite frankly, I'm growing rather bored with this ferris wheel of a debate. I'm only going to touch on a couple of points.\n \n \n \nIt's a two way street. I don't claim that my thinking and debating are perfect, but I suspect your desire to understand it could be lacking.\n\n \n I would love to understand your thought processes marc. It would be a fantastic tool to aid in educating others with similar thought processes.\n \n \nScience is not permitted to be held up to any branch of scientific thinking that stems from the possibility of creation, like specified complexity, designed systems, etc.\n\n \n It is. It has been. They have been rejected due to lack of evidence and the numerous fatal flaws that have been REPEATEDLY shown to you.\n \n \nScientists SHOULD not have any more political power than the general population (according to the U.S. foundations) but scientists can use the courts to help themselves to it, if the general population have their heads burried deeply in the sand. If the general population WAKES UP, (as in the word \"rebellious\" from my previous post) political trends can be reversed. One or two more cases similar to the Dover trial could do just that. \n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Yep those evil scientists, always working the courts to get what they want.\n \n Spare the nonsense. The courts are there, and they are used by everyone.\n \n \nIf only it were that simple. Their worldview is basically established by age 12 or 13, (to what exact degree is debatable - not important here) and then a little thing called puberty strikes, and to what extent they've been indoctrinated can largely determine what course their worldview will take.\n\n \n I'm living proof that this is nonsense.\n \n \nYou're swerving away from my point. My point was that if a source is proven wrong in one respect, it should be more subject to scruntity in other respects. If it would make you \"trust the book the same\", then there can only be two possiblities; 1) You don't believe much of ANYTHING unless you can physically sense it, or; 2) A red flag doesn't go up for you if a source lies to you. IMHO those are both common sense problems.\n\n \n I agree. If one error is found, it will likely put up red flag.\n \n I do not agree that this applies to the flood story of the Bible.\n \n \nIt's been \"pointed out\" repeatedly, with nothing to back it up. God is relevant to science in a negative way. God is a premise in science in a negative way, and I've proved it repeatedly. By out-of-the-blue put downs of creationism in threads in this forum, in news articles about \"evolution\" and in statements made by those prominent in science. It doesn't matter if constant put-downs of creation are true or false - they are projected by, and taken in by, imperfect humans. The \"Scientific American\" magazine has MOCKED creation in it's editorials - the NY Times has MOCKED creation in it's editorials. It permeates deeply all through society today. \n\n \n I don't understand \"in a negative way\". God is simply a non-issue.\n \n Creation \"science\" is what is mocked. Believers attempting to pass off their faith as science. When the quality of the \"science\" is laughable, people will laugh at it.\n \n Do you think it permeates as deeply as the influence of Christianity? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nLet's see how graceful you are, concerning God's \"irrelevance\" in science.\n\n \n God is irrelevent to science. That's a simple fact, not really up for debate.\n \n If you want to discuss God's role in politics, then yes, there's a major impact.\n \n \nIt's irrelevant to the atheist worldview. Time alone should not be an issue when determining how important a historical event was. Human nature tends to make us disregard history because ofr it's age. The circumstances of ancient wars / aztec indians, etc. should be the only determining factors concerning how significant they are, not time. A non atheist worldview may consider the flood to be more significant than you do, since the Bible compares it to a future event. And many future events the Bible predicted are coming true. \n\n \n Human nature is to put more emphasis on what we can actually experience or relate to in a direct manner. Anything is far more powerful if it can be seen, touched, tasted, smelled and heard. \n \n There's a reason why the Egyptians are so profoundly popular compared to other ancient civilizations. We can walk on the pyramids, we can see the mummies, read the hieroglyphs....all give us a feeling of direct connection and provide a concrete aspect to the history they represent. \n \n The flood doesn't have this, it never will. You can't point to a child and say \"Here's a picutre of the flood\" or \"You're now walking on the flood surface\". On top of that, it's so fantastical as to be pushing the limits (beyond the limits for many) of what is believable given their experiences and knowledge of the world. \n \n Therefore, it will never have the same impact.\n \n \nIt's not critical, I was just roughly going by electrolyte's statistics that you championed. The important part is that scientists worldviews differ significantly from the general population.\n\n \n There's a direct correlation between education and people's beliefs regarding creationism and their \"worldview\".\n \n The greater one's understanding of the world around them, the less likely they are to simply accept a myth as the explanation.\n \n \nIs science the only source of education? The power of other subjects shouldn't be underestimated either. When science conflicts with one of them, someone besides the scientific community should determine which subject is straying out of it's bounds.\n \n \n I'm not aware of science having a conflict with any subject other than religion. Even then, the conflict is generally limited to a very narrow branch of the religious community.\n \n \nIt sure does, especially when it comes to the faithful way science covers all of it's secular gaps. \n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nYou really don't think that's interesting, that man would design something similar to a complex natural existance, many decades before the natural thing was discovered? It's interesting to me how much the atheistic worldview is the absolute opposite of \"freethought\".\n\n \n First of all, they are so far from similar in their actual physical design as to make your comparison largely irrelevent.\n \n I think the discovery of the natural design is fascinating, I don't see the link to the designing of a propellor.\n \n IMHO, more correctly stated, it's amazing to you that others don't see \"god\" where you see \"god\". You want to see a connection, some proof of design, and you've latched onto this as some form of evidence.\n \n I don't see anything of the sort.\n \n \nPossibly because you're not from the U.S. and that's okay. When I similarily brought up GazzaElliott's not being from the U.S. he seemed to take some offense to it, and that's not the way I intended it. I can't expect you guys to take the same interest in some of the details of U.S. politics any more than you can with me, concerning your country's political details. You joined this discussion however, and that Dover court case is huge concerning it.\n\n \n I take a pretty large interest in US politics. However, IMHO, there are FAR more important issues facing the USA, and the world, than a couple of petty squabbles over religious issues that are of importance to only a very minor portion of the population - either believer or non-believer.\n \n \nYes, I do. That's the first time I've posted that link, and I've never noticed \"specified complexity\" discussed in depth here. \n \n On these forums? In a concise way? With no personal attacks on William Dembski? How about a link?\n\n \n Scroll down in this section of the forum to just about any link regarding ID, IC, etc...\n \n Dembski sets himself up for those attacks as the lone champion of his own assertions. \n \n \nVery basic details would be nice. I'm wondering why an atheist somehow has greater access to chemicals that exist on earth today more than a Christian scientist would.\n\n \n I don't even know where to start with this.\n \n They don't have any greater access. Why would access to chemicals be of any importance? I'm at a total loss on this one?\n \n As I've said marc, laziness is no excuse for ignorance. If you want a detailed explanation, look it up. I'm not your biology professor.\n \n \nYou're implying that the entire Roman Catholic Church rejects creation? And you call me dishonest?\n\n \n After this statement, I can certainly call you ignorant.\n \n Have you no clue regarding the RCC's stand on creation and the Genesis story?\n \n When you have a clue, get back to me. At that time, you can retract your assertion of my dishonesty, and I'll retract my assertion of your ignorance.\n \n \nIf something is taken, if a choice is made, if something is picked out, there is a consious motivation to do it - there is a purpose. In other secular, scientific changes we see and study, we don't see purpose.\n\n \n This is nonsense. The heat wave enveloping the USA right now is not doing so with the conscious motivation of purposefully killing those that are intolerant of heat. If you believe that it is consciously doing so, then you have some issues regarding reality.\n \n That heat wave is, however, the mechanism by which those that are more tolerant of heat are selected for survival.\n \n See the definition supplied by electolyte, it completely falsifies your claim.\n \n \nThe Christian side tends to maintain the text of the Constitution and intent of the framers, because most of it favors originalism.

If a person has a, shall we say, politically LEFT point of view, that's about all they see, that's the world they live in. They're seldom going to seek out conservative publications, talk radio, actual political debates between politicians etc. If they want news, they get it from the mainstream (left) news sources. Most secular entertainment leans left. Yet if a person has a politically RIGHT point of view, they're going to get exposure to the same mainstream news, the same secular entertainment that you do, only they're going to seek out information that agrees with them also, so they are going to often see both sides. I guess that means I should better understand your thought processes than you do mine. I'm afraid I don't however.\n \n \n \nIt is. It has been. They have been rejected due to lack of evidence and the numerous fatal flaws that have been REPEATEDLY shown to you. \n\n \n So there's no possible way that a new scientific discovery could call these \"rejections\" into question?

The comparisons between originalism and non originalism are not nonsense.\n \n \n \nI'm living proof that this is nonsense. \n\n \n So if there is one exception to an observed rule, it invalidates the entire rule? Have you ever worked with children?\n \n \n \nI agree. If one error is found, it will likely put up red flag. \n\n \n How about several - the many hoaxes that \"science\" has used to try to prove evolution? Piltdown man - peppered moths - Miller-Urey and on and on. A red flag goes up for me concerning science, when it (as one example) goes hunting for fossils that call into question the book of Genesis, and it FINDS them! \n \n \nI do not agree that this applies to the flood story of the Bible. \n\n \n Here's how it applies; If the flood story as described in the Bible is proclaimed to be false, a red flag could go up for someone looking for an excuse to ignore moral and ethical standards as described in the Bible.\n \n \n \n \nI don't understand \"in a negative way\". God is simply a non-issue. \n\n \n God is not a non-issue when he is mocked.\n \n Creation is the word of God. If it is mocked, he is mocked.\n \n \nCreation \"science\" is what is mocked. Believers attempting to pass off their faith as science. When the quality of the \"science\" is laughable, people will laugh at it. \n\n \n Science is loaded with laughter, it is loaded with emotion. They are both NOT SCIENCE. \n \n \nDo you think it permeates as deeply as the influence of Christianity? emoticon_rolleyes \n\n \n More than any negative uses of Christianity, yes.\n \n \n \n \nGod is irrelevent to science. That's a simple fact, not really up for debate.\n \n If you want to discuss God's role in politics, then yes, there's a major impact.\n\n \n If science has a major impact in politics, (as I can and have proved, the BSCS being one) and if God has a major impact in politics as you acknowledge, and if those who represent science conflict with God, THEN GOD IS NOT IRRELEVENT TO SCIENCE. My thought processes include logic and reason.\n \n \n \n \nHuman nature is to put more emphasis on what we can actually experience or relate to in a direct manner. Anything is far more powerful if it can be seen, touched, tasted, smelled and heard. \n\n \n What happened billions of years ago, and many more scientific proclamations, don't fall into that catagory.\n \n \nThere's a reason why the Egyptians are so profoundly popular compared to other ancient civilizations. We can walk on the pyramids, we can see the mummies, read the hieroglyphs....all give us a feeling of direct connection and provide a concrete aspect to the history they represent. \n\n \n Why are the hieroglyphs in a completely different catagory for you than the Bible? \n \n \nThe flood doesn't have this, it never will.

On top of that, it's so fantastical as to be pushing the limits (beyond the limits for many) of what is believable given their experiences and knowledge of the world. \n \n Therefore, it will never have the same impact. \n\n \n \nThe discovery of the Ebla archive in northern Syria in the 1970s has shown the Biblical writings concerning the Patriarchs to be viable. Documents written on clay tablets from around 2300 B.C. demonstrate that personal and place names in the Patriarchal accounts are genuine. The name \"Canaan\" was in use in Ebla, a name critics once said was not used at that time and was used incorrectly in the early chapters of the Bible. The word \"tehom\" (\"the deep\") in Genesis 1:2 was said to be a late word demonstrating the late writing of the creation story. \"Tehom\" was part of the vocabulary at Ebla, in use some 800 years before Moses. Ancient customs reflected in the stories of the Patriarchs have also been found in clay tablets from Nuzi and Mari.\n \n The Hittites were once thought to be a Biblical legend, until their capital and records were discovered at Bogazkoy, Turkey. Many thought the Biblical references to Solomon's wealth were greatly exaggerated. Recovered records from the past show that wealth in antiquity was concentrated with the king and Solomon's prosperity was entirely feasible. It was once claimed there was no Assyrian king named Sargon as recorded in Isaiah 20:1, because this name was not known in any other record. Then, Sargon's palace was discovered in Khorsabad, Iraq. The very event mentioned in Isaiah 20, his capture of Ashdod, was recorded on the palace walls. What is more, fragments of a stela memorializing the victory were found at Ashdod itself. \n\n \n http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-a008.html\n \n Why doesn't it have the same impact? Because it's not taught to the same degree, just like ID?\n \n \n \nThere's a direct correlation between education and people's beliefs regarding creationism and their \"worldview\". \n\n \n That's the claim, but in living in mainstream America for 51 years, I don't see it. When I see places not abounding in education; trailer parks, inner cities, factories, construction sites, trucker CB channels, I don't see an abundance of Christianity. In private business offices, sources of church fundings, management practices, I don't see an abundance of atheism. I see peoples' worldviews being fairly equally spread throughout education. (excluding most universities of course - there's a political reason for that) \n \n \nThe greater one's understanding of the world around them, the less likely they are to simply accept a myth as the explanation. \n\n \n Science is not the only method of understanding the world around us - classroom education overall is not the only method of understanding the world around us. Most of what we know (or ignore) about human behavior patterns aren't learned in school.\n \n \n \nI'm not aware of science having a conflict with any subject other than religion. Even then, the conflict is generally limited to a very narrow branch of the religious community. \n\n \n It's not narrow at all - it covers a broad range of medical practices, research and funding. Politics and economics. Eugenics. Abortion, stem cell research. Huge conflicts.\n \n \n \n \nFirst of all, they are so far from similar in their actual physical design as to make your comparison largely irrelevent.\n \n I think the discovery of the natural design is fascinating, I don't see the link to the designing of a propellor.\n \n IMHO, more correctly stated, it's amazing to you that others don't see \"god\" where you see \"god\". You want to see a connection, some proof of design, and you've latched onto this as some form of evidence.\n \n I don't see anything of the sort. \n\n \n Differences in worldviews. Seeing the same evidence and coming to different conclusions. You don't want to see a connection - a proof of design, and you've latched onto the scientific community's denial of it.\n \n \n \n \nI take a pretty large interest in US politics. However, IMHO, there are FAR more important issues facing the USA, and the world, than a couple of petty squabbles over religious issues that are of importance to only a very minor portion of the population - either believer or non-believer. \n\n \n Almost all those important issues require an either/or decision based on worldviews. Bush's first veto (stem cell research) isn't a petty squabble.\n \n \n \n \nScroll down in this section of the forum to just about any link regarding ID, IC, etc...\n \n Dembski sets himself up for those attacks as the lone champion of his own assertions. \n\n \n Lone champion? It's pretty hard to get company when future generations are BLOCKED from thinking about those assertions; assertions that are often based on very recent scientific discoveries.\n \n \n \nI don't even know where to start with this.\n \n They don't have any greater access. Why would access to chemicals be of any importance? I'm at a total loss on this one? \n\n \n Electrolyte stated that we have flu vaccines because of evolution studies. He provided no details however.\n \n \nAs I've said marc, laziness is no excuse for ignorance. If you want a detailed explanation, look it up.

At that time, you can retract your assertion of my dishonesty, and I'll retract my assertion of your ignorance. \n\n \n Here's my clue;\n \n \nHowever, the Roman Catholic church has by no means accepted the concept of Naturalistic Evolution in its entirety:\n \n Naturalistic evolution includes the belief that all aspects of humanity evolved from earlier species. This conflicts with the church teaching that each individual's \"spiritual soul is directly created by God.\" Naturalistic evolution concludes that what the church calls human spirit emerged \"from forces of living matter or as a simple epiphenomenon of this matter.\" The pope regards this as \"incompatible with the truth about man...[and] incapable of laying the foundation for the dignity of the person.\" \n The church teaches that God created the world and the rest of the universe from nothing. \"Vatican I solemnly defined that everyone must 'confess the world and all things which are contained in it, both spiritual and material, as regards their whole substance, have been produced by God from nothing' (Canons on God the Creator of All Things, canon 5).\" 9 \n Although the church accepts evolution as more than a hypothesis, it does not teach that evolution was driven by purely natural forces. Rather, it teaches that evolution was and is under God's control and guidance. \n\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_denom1.htm\n \n I'm not Roman Catholic, and you're not Roman Catholic, so we're even on this issue. Now you can give me your clues about what they believe, and we'll compare. I'm not ready to retract anything.\n \n \nIf something is taken, if a choice is made, if something is picked out, there is a consious motivation to do it - there is a purpose. In other secular, scientific changes we see and study, we don't see purpose. \n\n \n \nThis is nonsense. The heat wave enveloping the USA right now is not doing so with the conscious motivation of purposefully killing those that are intolerant of heat. If you believe that it is consciously doing so, then you have some issues regarding reality. \n\n \n That is my point!! Random, mindless processes shouldn't be called \"selection\" by the scientific community! If you believe a heatwave is doing any selecting, you have some issues regarding reality!\n \n \n (from an earlier post of yours)\n \nThe environment is the selector - it doesn't require consciousness or intelligence. This is so basic as to be pathetic.\n\n \n It's pathetic all right! If the environment is the selector, who did the picking out - who made the choice? Where is the purpose?\n \n \nThat heat wave is, however, the mechanism by which those that are more tolerant of heat are selected for survival. \n\n \n A RANDOM, MINDLESS mechanism, yes. Why not call it what it actually is?\n \n \nSee the definition supplied by electolyte, it completely falsifies your claim.\n\n \n That definition was sent down by your god, Darwin. It's the repeating something over and over until it's true syndrome. Dictionaries actually define the word \"selection\" in \"natural selection\" different than they do the word \"select\". The scientific community does have influence, doesn't it?\n \n \n \nPlease quote for me any references to the Christian god in the Constitution.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n The Constitution is based on unalienable rights.

   "Electrolyte has been pretty incoherent ever since he accused me of being a wannabe murderer.\n\n Yet another lie. I simply showed that marc's own morality system leaves him no recourse in the case that God asks him to kill someone. I \"accuse\" marc of having a lousy morality system, not of being a wannabe murderer, per his own insistence that we discuss the issue. marc, incidentally, refused to defend said morality system upon reading my very brief critique.\n By \"incoherent,\" I think marc means \"unrefutable,\" hence the total lack of response, unless of course he means that he's incapable of understanding my points. This may be true, but considering that Waxy is having no problems, we can be sure that the difficulty lies on marc's end.\n \n \nSo there's no possible way that a new scientific discovery could call these \"rejections\" into question?\n\n You don't have any new scientific discoveries, marc. The last attempt was based on Paley's design argument, which is two centuries old. Other sites promote arguments that were debunked years or decades (or centuries) ago. If you can show any scientific evidence that speaks for creationism and stands up to scrutiny, I'll be very surprised.\n \n \nI guess not - the courts have said that future generations shouldn't question it.\n\n No, the courts have said that teaching religion is school is unconstitutional, and -- once again -- you should be damn glad it is. No court can deny people from questioning scientific concepts.\n \n \nHow about several - the many hoaxes that \"science\" has used to try to prove evolution? Piltdown man - peppered moths - Miller-Urey and on and on.\n\n 1. The Piltdown Man hoax was exposed by evolutionary scientists, not creationists.\n 2. The peppered moth studies and experiments were not a hoax. I challenge you to defend your claim. Fair warning: if you repeat the XXXX in Wells's Icons of Evolution, I will make you look very, very, very foolish (yet again).\n 3. The Miller-Urey experiment was not a hoax. It showed quite conclusively that biologically important molecules can form in non-biological systems. The experiment was done using the best knowledge at the time, and subsequent experiments have also shown that these molecules can form in other conditions. Furthermore, we know that these molecules can form on places other than Earth, as meteorites containing amino acids have been recovered. More importantly, you are again discussing a topic that falls outside of the scope of evolution. In fact, you know you are presenting an invalid argument, and you do it anyway. That's against your morality system, marc; lying for Jesus is still lying. It's no wonder you won't defend your morality.\n \n \nA red flag goes up for me concerning science, when it (as one example) goes hunting for fossils that call into question the book of Genesis, and it FINDS them!\n\n This is quite demonstrably bass-ackwards. If criminologists use prior knowledge to search for forensic evidence, and they find it, having had no possible way to plant it there, do we think the criminologists are frauds? No, we know that the suspect's alibi is false. Likewise, we know that a literal interpretation of the Bible is false, not that there's something wrong with science.\n \n \nIf the flood story as described in the Bible is proclaimed to be false, a red flag could go up for someone looking for an excuse to ignore moral and ethical standards as described in the Bible.\n\n Nonsense. I ignore the moral and ethical standards as described in the Bible regardless of whether the flood story is true. I have my own moral and ethical standards, and they're a hell (pun intended) of a lot more ethical than those described in the Bible. It's a shame that marc is unwilling to even try to prove me wrong.\n Notice also that his statement is a textbook case of the wishful thinking fallacy.\n \n \nCreation is the word of God. If it is mocked, he is mocked.\nThis argument rests upon whether God actually did create anything. Until you have supported this claim, the argument does not stand.\n \n \nScience is loaded with laughter, it is loaded with emotion. They are both NOT SCIENCE.\n\n It appears that marc is suffering from RWS (Random Words Syndrome) again.\n \n \nIf science has a major impact in politics, (as I can and have proved, the BSCS being one) and if God has a major impact in politics as you acknowledge, and if those who represent science conflict with God, THEN GOD IS NOT IRRELEVENT TO SCIENCE. My thought processes include logic and reason.\n\n Your logic fails (again). Just because P impacts Q does not mean that Q impacts P.\n \n \nWhat happened billions of years ago, and many more scientific proclamations, don't fall into that catagory.\n\n Ever looked up at night and seen stars? You are seeing what happened billions of years ago. Ever used a radio telescope? With one, you can hear what happened billions of years ago. (Not that science is restricted to \"human nature\" anyway.)\n Speaking of which, when will you get around to defending your lie about hundreds of trillions of centuries ago?\n \n \nWhy doesn't it have the same impact? Because it's not taught to the same degree, just like ID?\n\n There was not evidence against Sargon's existence, or against the Hittites' existence, but there is evidence contrary to a global flood as described in the Bible. These are two very different issues, and equivocating them is dishonest. (But you don't have a problem with dishonesty, we can see.)\n \n \nI see peoples' worldviews being fairly equally spread throughout education.\n\n You don't see well, probably because you don't want to see proof that you're wrong yet again.\n \n \nScience is not the only method of understanding the world around us\n\n I agree, but you have nothing better, or even remotely comparable, to offer instead.\n \n \nDifferences in worldviews. Seeing the same evidence and coming to different conclusions.\n\n No, you explained that you've already come to your conclusion. You see God because you believe in God. This is not evidence, it is circular reasoning.\n \n \nYou don't want to see a connection - a proof of design, and you've latched onto the scientific community's denial of it.\n\n I want only to know what is true; again, I challenge you to show me \"proof\" that stands up to scrutiny. You haven't been doing too well.\n \n \nBush's first veto (stem cell research) isn't a petty squabble.\n\n Of course it's not a petty squabble... He's pushing his religious views on the scientific community. I'd say that's a rather big (unconstitutional) problem.\n \n \nLone champion? It's pretty hard to get company when future generations are BLOCKED from thinking about those assertions; assertions that are often based on very recent scientific discoveries.\n\n I challenge you to show how \"future generations are BLOCKED from thinking about those assertions.\" You will fail, because you are lying again.\n \n \nElectrolyte stated that we have flu vaccines because of evolution studies. He provided no details however.\n\n marc now resorts to insinuating either that I'm lying or can't back up my claims. Unsurprisingly, he is wrong yet again.\n \n Rather than elaborate on, say, this extremely simplistic explanation of how predicting changes in DNA helps us develop vaccines, I'd rather use a more awesome example of evolutionary knowledge at work. Here is the article that marc won't read, and here is an excellent overview that marc will ignore, should he choose to read it.\n \n \nI'm just looking for a VERY BASIC explanation that supports what YOU say.\n\n We certainly know that you won't understand anything more than a VERY BASIC explanation...\n \n \nI'm not Roman Catholic, and you're not Roman Catholic, so we're even on this issue. Now you can give me your clues about what they believe, and we'll compare. I'm not ready to retract anything.\n\n Wait, all of a sudden you're able to do research, but moments ago you couldn't type \"evolution vaccine\" into google? Incredible. (And by incredible, I mean you're not at all credible.)\n You have now changed your claim. Your claim is now that Catholics don't believe \"purely naturalistic\" evolution. I do not dispute this claim. However, your original claim was that some Catholics don't accept evolution, when the church's endorsement of the science is clear.\n \n \nThat is my point!! Random, mindless processes shouldn't be called \"selection\" by the scientific community! If you believe a heatwave is doing any selecting, you have some issues regarding reality!\n\n You have issues with the word \"random.\" Waxy's example did not involve random deaths, it involved the deaths of those intolerant to heat. For the umpteenth time, selection is by definition not random.\n I think if anyone here shouldn't be making claims about issues with reality, maybe it's the person who is pretending that I don't exist...\n \n \nIf the environment is the selector, who did the picking out - who made the choice? Where is the purpose?\n\n You mean, what did the picking out, and he answered that question. There is no embodied selector, and there is no purpose to evolution. This you have been told, and your ignoring the explanation is no excuse.\n \n \nA RANDOM, MINDLESS mechanism, yes. Why not call it what it actually is?\n\n I do call it what it actually is. You, because you can't read, call it random.\n \n \nThat definition was sent down by your god, Darwin.\n\n What a comeback! I mean, I'm convinced!\n \n \nDictionaries actually define the word \"selection\" in \"natural selection\" different than they do the word \"select\".\n\n But I provided the dictionary definition of selection, not select. One of these days, you should re-learn how to read my posts.\n It's funny how you tend to quote the dictionary in sad attempts at equivocation, but when I provide a dictionary definition for the exact term in question, you object on the grounds that I didn't define a related word.\n \n \nThe Constitution is based on unalienable rights. Endowed by their Creator. Without them, there are no rights, only priviliges. Endowed by man, removable by man. Creator = originalism. No creator = non originalism.\n\n (Sorry Waxy, but you're welcome to repeat me.)\n I see no quotes of the Constitution there, marc. Put up or shut up.",

   "Originally Posted by marc9000\n That definition was sent down by your god, Darwin.\n\n \n Well done marc! You've finally admitted that you are treating this as a religion verses religion debate. (We all realised it, but it's good of you to admit it). Here we can conclusively show you to be wrong. Evolution is not a religion, Darwin, Huxley and Dawkins are not deities or prophets, and no one worships at the idol of natural selection. You refuse to believe that, either because your pastor has told you so or because you don't really understand the issue. You are entitled to your belief, but please argue with what you can substanciate, not with clever word play and consistantly shifting arguments (the man who built his house on sand and all that).\n \n I'd recomend some of Gould's essays (Nos. 26 - 30 in Bully for Brontosaurus, I have the ISBN if you want it), but I doubt you'd read them. He talks (respectfully) about the differences between religion and science, and how they can work together, but lambasts those who use thier religious ideology to attack science. He uses the example of Hesperopithucus to show how science is continually open to revision and correction, whereas creationists merely stand, point and scream at the top of their lungs that science made a mistake and therefore it's all wrong and should be cast into the pit. \n \n The point is that science should not have dogma. There is no central figure/law that cannot be overthrown by data. Some scientists do become dogmatic in thier approach, but they are continually challeneged by other members. The church (meaning all religions) has debate over the interpretation of texts, but as these texts are derived from God, or someone writing at the behest or under the influence of God, the text itself cannot be revised. This is why science is seen as more open, and more relevant, as science continually adapts to new knowledge and religion does not (in fact it often ignores or suppresses it (That sounds familiar somehow)).\n \n I'm now fully expecting an all out atatck on Gould; no doubt he's one of these evil atheist conspirators as well. Can I suggest you read those essays? They aren't long and may actually give you a clue of the angle that scientists are coming from. Understanding is key to changing minds. YOu'd have far mre success on here if you actually read around to understand where scientists are coming from and if you understood scientific method (Here comes the hand waving).\n \n \nMy thought processes may be hard for you to understand because of something I heard not long ago. If a person has a, shall we say, politically LEFT point of view, that's about all they see, that's the world they live in. They're seldom going to seek out conservative publications, talk radio, actual political debates between politicians etc. If they want news, they get it from the mainstream (left) news sources. Most secular entertainment leans left. Yet if a person has a politically RIGHT point of view, they're going to get exposure to the same mainstream news, the same secular entertainment that you do, only they're going to seek out information that agrees with them also, so they are going to often see both sides. I guess that means I should better understand your thought processes than you do mine. I'm afraid I don't however.\n\n \n Rough translation:\n \n I'm correct, and you are a bunch of mamby pamby left-liberals who don't know anything. \n \n I'm amazed at the ego in this statement. You accuse the media and most politicians of being left liberals (at a time with a president who is a leading member of the religious right), and then say that your right wing view is the only right way and that the rest of us are too laxy/stupid to comprehend it. Have you considered the posibility that the rest of us seem left wing because you are on the very extreme right? I've already told you that I'm naturally conservative in my politics (Middle-right) but you dismissed that in a very patronising way. This isn't a politics forum, but please, don't make stupid generalisations you can't substanciate, or you'll just make your self look more ridiculous with every claim....\n \n \nDifferences in worldviews. Seeing the same evidence and coming to different conclusions. You don't want to see a connection - a proof of design, and you've latched onto the scientific community's denial of it.\n\n \n When i mentioned this as a method for scientific accuracy you attacked it saying worldviews were irrelevant. You now use them to defend your own statement. Beware being hoisted on your own petard. Have you realised that the exact opposite of this applies to you? We've already discussed your for or against stance, and you agreed with it. You see a connection because you want there to be one, whether there is or not... I can't speak for the other members here, but for myself, I'm undecided. There could be a God, but He's not something relevant to science. I'll decide whether there is a God in my own mind, not try to force my version onto kids.\n \n I would recommend you read and digest electrolytes post. I'd also recommend you respond to his challenges, otherwise you just appear to be having a rant with no evidence, and no purpose....",

   "A lot can be picked up between the lines of that two sentence statement, that's for sure! Isn't understanding others thought processes part of what these forums are about? Between the lines says that my thought processes are rare and different, right? They really aren't, otherwise politics wouldn't be so controversial, the Dover case wouldn't have been so newsworthy, etc.\n \n Educating others? \"Thought processes\" should be determined by educators to be right or wrong? \n \n My thought processes may be hard for you to understand because of something I heard not long ago.

I've never encountered anyone so impervious to evidence and logic before in my life. On top of that, I truly believe that you don't do it intentionally, I dont' think you are intentionally ignorant or dishonest. IMHO, the power of your convictions is like the ultimate set of \"rose coloured glasses\" it simply alters the reality around you to fit your \"worldview\".\n \n I think you'd find that I'm not \"left\" in my views on the vast majority of topics in any way. I know that for American's, especially self proclaimed \"conservatives\" painting someone as being \"left\", or worse yet the dreaded \"liberal\" is the ultimate way of dismissing them and their beliefs as being irrelevent and irresponsible. The \"scarlet L\" so to speak.\n \n You can try that with me, but I think you'll find that you won't get too far.\n \n \nSo there's no possible way that a new scientific discovery could call these \"rejections\" into question? I guess not - the courts have said that future generations shouldn't question it. So much for freethought.\n\n \n Of course their is, now all that's needed is the evidence.\n \n The courts have said no such thing. They simply said that religion should not be taught during a science class.\n \n Freethought is fully intact.\n \n \nSo if there is one exception to an observed rule, it invalidates the entire rule? Have you ever worked with children?\n\n \n It means it's not a rule, it's a generalization. In this case, a very shaky one.\n \n I haven't worked with children.\n \n \nHow about several - the many hoaxes that \"science\" has used to try to prove evolution?

A red flag goes up for me concerning science, when it (as one example) goes hunting for fossils that call into question the book of Genesis, and it FINDS them! \n\n \n See electrolyte's response.\n \n \nHere's how it applies; If the flood story as described in the Bible is proclaimed to be false, a red flag could go up for someone looking for an excuse to ignore moral and ethical standards as described in the Bible.\n\n \n Completely illogical.\n \n \nGod is not a non-issue when he is mocked.\n \n Creation is the word of God. If it is mocked, he is mocked.\n\n \n Did you read my statements at all marc? If you did, you clearly didn't comprehend them.\n \n Creation is not being mocked, creation \"science\" is what is being mocked.\n \n Science doesn't mock faith, but if you attempt to pass that faith off as science, then yes, it will be challenged, and where appropriate, mocked. :) \n \n \nIf science has a major impact in politics, (as I can and have proved, the BSCS being one) and if God has a major impact in politics as you acknowledge, and if those who represent science conflict with God, THEN GOD IS NOT IRRELEVENT TO SCIENCE. My thought processes include logic and reason.\n\n \n Yes, FAULTY logic and reason.\n \n \nWhat happened billions of years ago, and many more scientific proclamations, don't fall into that catagory.\n\n \n Sure they do. However, we have the entire world around us to support the proclamations - modern analogues, fossil and stratigraphic evidence we can touch and walk on, etc... etc....\n \n \nWhy are the hieroglyphs in a completely different catagory for you than the Bible? \n\n \n Hieroglyphs were simply another example of the visible history, in and of themselves, they have limited value.\n \n Here's a question for you, why are the teaching of the hieroglyphs - ie regarding the Egyptian gods and pharoahs - false in your opinion, while you consider the Bible true?\n \n Is there not the same evidence for both?\n \n \nWhy doesn't it have the same impact? Because it's not taught to the same degree, just like ID?\n\n \n I don't know, you tell me.\n \n The sad thing is, you've done nothing but equivocate with this response, you haven't answered a thing, or even recognized the point being made. You'd make a fine politician marc.\n \n \nThat's the claim, but in living in mainstream America for 51 years, I don't see it. When I see places not abounding in education; trailer parks, inner cities, factories, construction sites, trucker CB channels, I don't see an abundance of Christianity. In private business offices, sources of church fundings, management practices, I don't see an abundance of atheism. I see peoples' worldviews being fairly equally spread throughout education. (excluding most universities of course - there's a political reason for that) \n\n \n See electrolyte's response.\n \n \nScience is not the only method of understanding the world around us - classroom education overall is not the only method of understanding the world around us. Most of what we know (or ignore) about human behavior patterns aren't learned in school.\n\n \n It's not the only method, but when it comes to understanding the world around us, including human behaviour, it's proven to be the best method.\n \n \nDifferences in worldviews.

If you need to equivocate such things as to affirm your belief in god, then have at it.\n \n \nAlmost all those important issues require an either/or decision based on worldviews. Bush's first veto (stem cell research) isn't a petty squabble.\n\n \n As electrolyte stated, it's a prime example of the religious pushing their views upon everyone.

Evolution is not a religion, Darwin, Huxley and Dawkins are not deities or prophets, and no one worships at the idol of natural selection.\n\n \n Well, thank you very much, I've always regarded this as a religon vs. religion debate, and thought it was clear. Let's look at the definition;\n \n \nre\u00b7li\u00b7gion ( P ) Pronunciation Key (r-ljn)\n n. \n \n Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. \n A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. \n The life or condition of a person in a religious order. \n A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. \n A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. \n\n \n Beliefs, values, practices, causes, principles, activities. They are all involved in atheism. I believe those six words were in the minds of the U.S. founding fathers when they prohibited the establishment of any one particular religon. They didn't want those things forced on an entire population by one belief system. And the belief system of atheism applies. Why would you think those six things aren't present in atheism, and why couldn't they clash with religion?\n \n \n \n You refuse to believe that, either because your pastor has told you so or because you don't really understand the issue. \n\n \n No, there's a third reason - it's an understanding of history. Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mao, Ho Chi Min, Tito, Napoleon, and Breshnev were all non-religious. They opposed religion, and their beliefs, values, activities, etc. tended to harmonize with \"science\". Eugenics, for example.\n \n \n You are entitled to your belief, but please argue with what you can substanciate, not with clever word play and consistantly shifting arguments (the man who built his house on sand and all that). \n\n \n Arguments tend to shift when I have three or more shifters coming at me from all angles. I appreciate your saying that I'm entitled to my beliefs - obviously there are a few here who would prefer that I not post them. Back in post #171, I quoted a few screw-ups from some prominent science people; Lewontin, Ruse, and Provine. They were screw-ups not because they were false, but because they were truth that not all of the scientific community would like exposed. Waxy made one too - this one;\n \n \nI would love to understand your thought processes marc. It would be a fantastic tool to aid in educating others with similar thought processes.\n\n \n My type of thought processes should be ~corrected~, or ~educated out~?? Kind of like courts, not people, deciding what should be taught in schools. \n \n \nI'd recomend some of Gould's essays (Nos. 26 - 30 in Bully for Brontosaurus, I have the ISBN if you want it), but I doubt you'd read them. He talks (respectfully) about the differences between religion and science, and how they can work together, but lambasts those who use thier religious ideology to attack science. \n\n \n \n I haven't read them - I'll try to get to them when I get time. I'd like to have the ISBN. From what little I've seen of Gould, he does seem like one of the more civilized atheists. But if he lambasts those who use their religious ideology to attack science, I'm wondering if he equally lambasts militant atheists who use science to attack religion. \n \n \nHe uses the example of Hesperopithucus to show how science is continually open to revision and correction, whereas creationists merely stand, point and scream at the top of their lungs that science made a mistake and therefore it's all wrong and should be cast into the pit. \n\n \n Creationists also do something else, they question how many people are GETTING THE MESSAGE when science corrects itself. Grafton Elliot Smith was a scientist, and he was instrumental in getting the Nebrasks man hoax widely distributed in a popular Brittish magazine in the 1920's. Just because it wasn't a scientific magazine didn't mean that many people weren't taken in by it. (Smith was also involved with the Piltdown man hoax) Creationists also wonder how many people have been led to believe that hoaxes were honest accidents, like a mistake in restoring bone formations. How many of them learn from science that Piltdown man's jaw was stained with potassium bichromate, or that his teeth were filed down to make them look more human? Or that it spent 40 years locked up in a vault where very few could study it. \n \n Neanderthal man lasted for about 44 years, roughly in the same time period. A life size cave scene showing a whole family of Neanderthals became a very popular display in the hall of the Chicago Field Museum of Natural History in the 1920's. A picture of it appeared in countless textbooks and other museums around the world. It stayed in the museums and textbooks some 20 years after it was disproved.  Are people getting the message about revision and correction? An entire generation of people lived believing that these two hoaxes were true. Is it completely unreasonable to wonder if there are unrevised and uncorrected hoaxes on display today? The answer is yes of course, electrolyte still believes in Miller-Urey and peppered moths!! I could load him up with links about those hoaxes, but why should I bother? :xbanghead \n \n \nThe point is that science should not have dogma. \n\n \n The point is that it only takes a few scientists with dogma to pollute a huge part of science. Is there any other branch of science, or any subject taught in schools, that is loaded with a fraction of as many intentional, dishonest hoaxes as evolutionary biology? Is there any other subject that has court battles concerning the introduction of diversity in how the subject is taught? Is it completely impossible for there to be a relationship between these two curious things?\n \n \nThere is no central figure/law that cannot be overthrown by data. Some scientists do become dogmatic in thier approach, but they are continually challeneged by other members. The church (meaning all religions) has debate over the interpretation of texts, but as these texts are derived from God, or someone writing at the behest or under the influence of God, the text itself cannot be revised. This is why science is seen as more open, and more relevant, as science continually adapts to new knowledge and religion does not (in fact it often ignores or suppresses it (That sounds familiar somehow)).\n\n \n Yes it does sound familiar! William Dembski has come up with complicated mathematical formulas (nothing to do with religion) for detecting design in the universe, as distinct from chance or accident. He started a research center for testing for design at Baylor University. It was shut down by other faculty members, even though they couldn't understand his mathematical formulas. Is this what you mean by adapting to new knowledge? \n \n \n \nI'm now fully expecting an all out atatck on Gould; no doubt he's one of these evil atheist conspirators as well. Can I suggest you read those essays? They aren't long and may actually give you a clue of the angle that scientists are coming from. Understanding is key to changing minds. YOu'd have far mre success on here if you actually read around to understand where scientists are coming from and if you understood scientific method (Here comes the hand waving). \n\n \n <waves hand< You and all your lil friends would have more success here if you actually read around to understand where the theory of I.D. comes from, and how it's no more religious than evolution is atheistic.\n \n \n \n \nRough translation:\n \n I'm correct, and you are a bunch of mamby pamby left-liberals who don't know anything. \n\n \n It doesn't need to be translated, just read what it says - it's in English.\n \n \nI'm amazed at the ego in this statement. You accuse the media and most politicians of being left liberals (at a time with a president who is a leading member of the religious right), and then say that your right wing view is the only right way and that the rest of us are too laxy/stupid to comprehend it. Have you considered the posibility that the rest of us seem left wing because you are on the very extreme right? I've already told you that I'm naturally conservative in my politics (Middle-right) but you dismissed that in a very patronising way. This isn't a politics forum, but please, don't make stupid generalisations you can't substanciate, or you'll just make your self look more ridiculous with every claim....\n\n \n Eeeevrybody is a conservative!!!\n \n I can substantiate them largely with my reference to originalism vs. non-originalism. That subject seems to soar far over the heads of you & the gang. \n \n \n \n \nWhen i mentioned this as a method for scientific accuracy you attacked it saying worldviews were irrelevant. \n\n \n Where did I say worldviews were irrelevent? I get a lot of vague references by several opponents here, with no post numbers, or links with no specifics.\n \n \nYou now use them to defend your own statement. Beware being hoisted on your own petard. Have you realised that the exact opposite of this applies to you? We've already discussed your for or against stance, and you agreed with it. You see a connection because you want there to be one, whether there is or not... I can't speak for the other members here, but for myself, I'm undecided. There could be a God, but He's not something relevant to science. I'll decide whether there is a God in my own mind, not try to force my version onto kids.\n\n \n Your indecision doesn't seem to be at a 50/50 ratio at this time.\n \n \n \nI would recommend you read and digest electrolytes post. I'd also recommend you respond to his challenges, otherwise you just appear to be having a rant with no evidence, and no purpose....\n\n \n How should I respond to his posts? About 90% of them are personal insults. If I respond to the other 10%, wouldn't it seem like I'm accepting his insults? \n \n I don't mind spirited debate, but he's become too angry. It's happened to me before here - someone gets angry at my posts, (the \"prefer that I not post them\" thing that I referenced above) and then start running to the fallacy list rather than actually respond. The amazing part is, just as they do that they drastically turn up their own fallacy use, and expect to be exempted from it. See if you see the slightest hint of \"needling\", or \"emotive language\" in his posts and get back to me. Concerning his recent start of a new thread in the philosophy section is \"changing the subject\". I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get the point.",

   "I'm sure it comes as no surprise to you marc that I don't consider you \"normal\". In fact, I've never encountered another person even remotely similar to you in my life. I do find your thought processes fascinating, simply because they are so different and extreme. I've never encountered anyone so impervious to evidence and logic before in my life. On top of that, I truly believe that you don't do it intentionally, I dont' think you are intentionally ignorant or dishonest. IMHO, the power of your convictions is like the ultimate set of \"rose coloured glasses\" it simply alters the reality around you to fit your \"worldview\".\n \n I think you'd find that I'm not \"left\" in my views on the vast majority of topics in any way. \n\n \n From your above paragraph, I'm not finding that. Your constant referrals to electrolyte's posts don't help me to find it either. If you've never encountered anyone similar to me, you don't get out much. \n \n \n \nI know that for American's, especially self proclaimed \"conservatives\" painting someone as being \"left\", or worse yet the dreaded \"liberal\" is the ultimate way of dismissing them and their beliefs as being irrelevent and irresponsible. The \"scarlet L\" so to speak.\n \n You can try that with me, but I think you'll find that you won't get too far.\n\n \n Eeeeverybody wants to be a conservative! I have gotten far, in this thread, and in one in the environmental forum long ago.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSee electrolyte's response. \n\n \n I did, I see he still believes in Miller-Urey and peppered moths!!\n \n \n \n \n \nDid you read my statements at all marc? If you did, you clearly didn't comprehend them. \n\n \n I read and comprehended them perfectly, I just didn't agree with them.\n \n \nCreation is not being mocked, creation \"science\" is what is being mocked.\n \n Science doesn't mock faith, but if you attempt to pass that faith off as science, then yes, it will be challenged, and where appropriate, mocked. :) \n\n \n What if no attempt is made to pass off faith as science, if faith is pulled out of the clear blue sky by science and then mocked? Do you believe that happens? (See the first two posts in each of the following links before you answer)\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=7901\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=7815\n \n \n \n \nSure they do. However, we have the entire world around us to support the proclamations - modern analogues, fossil and stratigraphic evidence we can touch and walk on, etc... etc....\n\n \n We have the entire world around us to support what the Bible says too, in the same ways. \n \n \n \n \nHere's a question for you, why are the teaching of the hieroglyphs - ie regarding the Egyptian gods and pharoahs - false in your opinion, while you consider the Bible true? \n\n \n I never said they were false! If they don't conflict with the Bible, I have no problem with them. If they do, I have to question who is presenting them / translating them.\n \n \nIs there not the same evidence for both? \n\n \n I would say so, yes. The only difference would be that the ACLU would only sue over ONE of them being taught.\n \n \n \n \nI don't know, you tell me. \n\n \n That would be it, yes. \n \n \nThe sad thing is, you've done nothing but equivocate with this response, you haven't answered a thing, or even recognized the point being made. You'd make a fine politician marc. \n\n \n I recognized the point being made perfectly, it was that the hieroglyphs are somehow more credible than the Bible. I answered it, by demolishing it.\n \n \n \nSee electrolyte's response. \n\n \n Here is the last part of his link;\n \n \nResults for this survey are based on telephone interviews conducted under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International among a nationwide sample of 2,000 adults, 18 years of age or older, from July 7-17, 2005. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. For results based on Form 1 (N=1,000) or Form 2 (N=1,000) only, the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. \n \n In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls. \n\n \n Guess what - my 51 years involved a whole lot more than 2000 people, between July 7-17 2005! That's the second time you've referred to electrolyte's posts - it's not helping your credibility, or your conservative image! \n \n \n \n \nIt's not the only method, but when it comes to understanding the world around us, including human behaviour, it's proven to be the best method. \n\n \n That didn't help your conservative image either. \n \n \n \n \nAs electrolyte stated, it's a prime example of the religious pushing their views upon everyone. I agree, it's far from a petty squabble.\n\n \n Like electrolyte, you have no clue regarding the issue. Bush's veto neither prohibits nor allows stem cell research to go on in this country. What he vetoed was a bill authorizing the use of Federal funds for embryonic stem cell research. The vast majority of research in this country and the consequential medical breakthroughs that result is conducted and paid for by private industry. It's about the probability of success and profit in the research. Researchers who have time and prestige invested in embryonic stem cell researh can't find private funding because it's not seen as being successful enough to be profitable. Bush vetoed bigger domestic government - that's what it boils down to. You're 0 for 3 in electrolyte references.\n \n \n \n \nNo one is blocked. What's with the strawmen? Why be dishonest? \n\n \n No strawman, no dishonesty. You call someone a \"lone champion\", concerning I.D. assertions, when schooling about those assertions is outlawed in schools, thereby producing no new thought for what the lone champion asserts. \n \n \nWhat new scientific discoveries? That a flagellum has a very faint similarity to a propellor designed by humans? Give me a break. \n\n \n That and many others - possibly some undiscovered ones, but you don't want to know about them, do you?\n \n \n \n \nWrong again marc. I was baptised and raised Roman Catholic, technically I suppose I still am.\n \n http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/vaticanview.html\n \n http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Atrium/8410/evolution.html\n \n Mysteriously marc, using a simple Google search, these were bookending the link you chose to post.\n \n I think they prove my point. \n\n \n You think? How about specifying how they prove it? \n \n \nIf you can find anywhere on this board where I have stated that \"god\" can be ruled out completely in the process of evolution, please post it. I don't believe that god had anything to do with it, but I'm fully aware of the fact that I cannot prove it. \n\n \n If only the scientific community was aware of that - if only taxpayer dollars weren't being spent trying to prove it. \n \n \n \n \n:xbanghead \n \n My intial point was very clear. If you failed to comprehend it that's your loss.\n I'm not going to repeat it do you ad nauseum and you've chosen to do with your baseless assertions. \n\n \n I comprehended it, and demolished it.\n \n \n \n \nSo the term Creator - non descript by intention is the best you can do.\n \n Huh, funny how that worked out.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n It's all that is necessary.

   "Beliefs, values, practices, causes, principles, activities. They are all involved in atheism.\n\n You purposely take the first three words out of their proper context, which includes \"based on the teachings of a spiritual leader.\" Neither atheism nor evolution have such a leader.\n The fourth definition is dead last in the list for a reason: If I love baseball, and I pursue it with zeal, then baseball would be my religion. This, of course, is not the meaning of \"religion\" as it is applicable to this discussion.\n \n \nNo, there's a third reason - it's an understanding of history. Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mao, Ho Chi Min, Tito, Napoleon, and Breshnev were all non-religious.\n\n marc is now committing the fallacy that is so ridiculous that it is used as the very example of the fallacy! Of course, his assertions are also wrong, but the \"Hitler was...\" is priceless.\n \n \nArguments tend to shift when I have three or more shifters coming at me from all angles.\n\n Complaining that your arguments get rebutted regardless of how you shift and squirm isn't going to convince anybody. If your Argument A gets refuted, and you then follow it with Argument B, and it gets refuted, the refutations are not nullified by any claim like, \"But you were just rebutting Argument A!\"\n \n \nBack in post #171, I quoted a few screw-ups from some prominent science people; Lewontin, Ruse, and Provine. They were screw-ups not because they were false, but because they were truth that not all of the scientific community would like exposed.\n\n You're referring to your blatant Lewontin quote mine and Ruse's demonstrably false claims and fallacious comparisons? Provine knows perfectly well that it's not science's fault that religion peddles stories that, when disproved by science, endangers belief in religion.\n \n \nFrom what little I've seen of Gould, he does seem like one of the more civilized atheists.\n\n Gould, like Darwin, was an agnostic.\n \n \nCreationists also do something else, they question how many people are GETTING THE MESSAGE when science corrects itself...\n\n I still fail to see why not adhering steadfastly to an ideal despite evidence is a bad thing. I don't fail to see, however, why you think that is.\n Nebraska Man never gained acceptance in the scientific community.

Again, I challenge you to support your assertion, even though you're too cowardly to do so.\n \n \nHow should I respond to his posts? About 90% of them are personal insults. If I respond to the other 10%, wouldn't it seem like I'm accepting his insults?\n\n Ah, we've discovered the problem: marc thinks that soundly refuting his points is a personal insult. No wonder he feels so insulted.\n \n \nThe amazing part is, just as they do that they drastically turn up their own fallacy use, and expect to be exempted from it.\n\n Another lie; I have explicitly invited marc to accurately expose any fallacies I have committed.\n \n \nConcerning his recent start of a new thread in the philosophy section is \"changing the subject\".\n\n I started a new thread so that we could discuss the topic in the appropriate forum and keep pertinent E/C content here. No \"changing the subject\" actually took place, unless you count your ignoring many of my points.\n \n \n \nI did, I see he still believes in Miller-Urey and peppered moths!!\n\n And there's no reason not to do so.\n \n \nWhat if no attempt is made to pass off faith as science, if faith is pulled out of the clear blue sky by science and then mocked?\n\n Again, if somebody's faith happens to say, \"There is no such thing as potassium,\" and science happens to show that there is a such thing as potassium, that's not an attack on faith from science. Frankly, faith shouldn't make such stupid assertions, if you ask me...\n \n \nWe have the entire world around us to support what the Bible says too, in the same ways.\n\n Uh, what planet are you living on?

Creator = creation. No creator (atheism) = evolution.\n\n No, he asked for specific quotes, and you failed to provide. You failed to specify Christianity, and Waxy nailed you on it. You simply repeated your inane claim that evolution is atheistic. Support your assertion, marc. Defend all of your lies; if they're not lies, they should be easy to defend. Put up or shut up.",

   "I'd be grateful if you'd link to a reputable source showing that Neanderthal man is a hoax.\n\n \n http://anthro.palomar.edu/homo2/mod_homo_2.htm\n \n Here is the most relevent part of this link that makes my point;\n \n \nThe remains of more than 400 Neandertals have been found. The most controversial one was excavated in 1908 at la Chapelle-aux-Saints in southwestern France. This is a nearly complete skeleton of a man who would have been elderly by Neandertal standards. The bones were analyzed between 1911 and 1913 by the noted French paleontologist, Marcellin Boule . Unfortunately, Boule's prejudices got in the way of scientific objectivity.  He described the La Chapelle-aux-Saints man, and subsequently all Neandertals, as dull-witted, brutish, ape-like creatures who walked hunched over with a shuffling gait. Unfortunately, this mistaken view was universally accepted by paleoanthropologists for decades. It also became the source of the popular images of dim-witted cavemen that still appear in cartoons and movies.\n \n After reanalysis of the La Chapelle-aux-Saints skeleton in the 1950's, it became clear that a serious mistake had been made. This had been an atypical Neandertal. He was at least 40 years old with a somewhat hunched over posture resulting from severe arthritis in his spine. There was a bowing of his legs that may have resulted from rickets disease in childhood. He had lost most of his teeth and part of his jaw resulting in a disharmonic looking face. Despite these deforming infirmities, it is now clear that the La Chapelle-aux-Saints man was much more like us in appearance than had been believed by Marcellin Boule. \n\n \n The cave scene that I described in my post #181 was the result of Boule's prejudices, not an accurate representation of Neanderthals, which could have very well been fully human, no more different from humans today than different races alive today.\n \n Repeating a line from above;\n \nIt also became the source of the popular images of dim-witted cavemen that still appear in cartoons and movies. \n\n \n And it also became the source of half-man, half-ape images projected into the minds of future generations, for a full 44 years. (and beyond, as we can see)\n \n This is one of many proofs that ONE scientist's mistaken view can snowball into atheistic scientific \"theories\", when creation is ruled out in advance.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Miller-Urey;\n \n http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/mole00/mole00311.htm\n \n \n1. For starters, no one knows what the composition of the atmosphere was\n in early geological times. Harold Urey and Stanley Miller (Urey's graduate\n student) did the \"sparking\" experiments that you refer to. Many other\n groups, for example biologist Carl Sagan (of \"billions and billions of stars\n fame\"), subsequently performed similar experiments using different types and\n amounts of starting gases, different energy sources, different total\n pressures, and on and on.\n NONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS \"PROVES\" THAT LIFE ON EARTH STARTED BY ANY ONE \n OF THESE MECHANISMS.

Your own link proves you wrong on both accounts.\n \n Re: Miller-Urey experiment:\n \nBut it's clear that this one's results were inconclusive.\n\n First, marc's source misrepresents the experiment as trying to prove that life originated by any of the included mechanisms. It doesn't, and it never intended to. Instead, it showed (as I explained above, well before marc even posted this \"refutation\") that biologically important molecules can arise via naturalistic processes. If marc disagrees with this conclusion, then he is once again lying.\n \n \nIt turned out that the photographs of light and dark moths resting on a tree trunk were faked by pinning and gluing dead moths onto logs and trunks, and that the moths were either dead or came from the laboratory to be used in the supposed \"filmed experiments.\"\n\n\n I warned you. I specifically warned you that if you used Wells's arguments, you'd get fried. Well, here you go:\n The moths do rest on the trunks and branches of the birch trees. Merely because two samples were placed on the tree for the purpose of illustrating the effect of camoflauge is not fraud, nor lying, nor even deceitful. If it were true that the moths do not rest on the tree, then the claims would be fraudulent; instead, the desperate claims that the moths do not rest on the trees are what are fraudulent. Majerus actually provides pictures of moths resting on trunks.\n marc's link continues to say that no evolution occurred. This is a lie, as demonstrated by the author's own admission that ratios of alleles changed. This is what the peppered moth example is claimed to show: natural selection in action as a mechanism of changing allelic frequencies in populations (or, more simply, evolution by natural selection).\n \n Let's see, something about 0-for-3?",

It's about the probability of success and profit in the research. Researchers who have time and prestige invested in embryonic stem cell researh can't find private funding because it's not seen as being successful enough to be profitable.

And you call me dishonest?\n\n \n Your reply.\n \n You dishonestly twist my reply to fit your simple one line avoidance of the point.\n \n I didn't imply any such thing, I pointed out to you that all Roman Catholics are thestic evolutionist, who accept both evolution, and creation.\n \n \nAfter this statement, I can certainly call you ignorant.\n \n Have you no clue regarding the RCC's stand on creation and the Genesis story?\n \n When you have a clue, get back to me.

I was baptised and raised Roman Catholic, technically I suppose I still am.\n \n http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/proj...ticanview.html\n \n http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Atri...evolution.html\n \n Mysteriously marc, using a simple Google search, these were bookending the link you chose to post.\n \n I think they prove my point.\n\n \n My reply.\n \n Had you read the links, you would have seen clearly that the Roman Catholic stance accepts evolution, while at the same time accepting creation. Thus making all Roman Catholics theistic evolutionists.\n \n Let me quote some relevent sections for you to help you in the learning process -\n \n \nThe Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experiences in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter-for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God. \n\n \n \nIn the speech, the Pope makes clear in his speech that he understood the difference between evolution (the highly probable fact) and the mechanism for evolution, a matter of hot dispute among scientists. John Paul said, \"And, to tell the truth, rather than the theory of evolution, we should speak of several theories of evolution.\" He recognized that there were \"different explanations advanced for the mechanism of evolution\" and different \"philosophies\" upon which the theory of evolution is based. The philosophy out of bounds to Catholics, the pope indicated, is one which is \"materialist\" and which denies the possibility that man \"was created in the image and likeness of God.\" Human dignity, the pope suggested, cannot be reconciled with such a \"reductionist\" philosophy. Thus, as with Pius XII, the critical teaching of the Church is that God infuses souls into man-regardless of what process he might have used to create our physical bodies. Science, the Pope insisted, can never identify for us \"the moment of the transition into the spiritual\"-that is a matter exclusively with the magesterium of religion. \n\n \n In short, both links state the same thing - Roman Catholics have no problem with evolution, unless God is barred from the process. Thus, they are theistic evolutionists, free to believe in both evolution and creation.\n \n I'll be awaiting your retraction.\n \n \nI comprehended it, and demolished it.\n\n \n :p\n \n \nIt's all that is necessary. Creator = creation. No creator (atheism) = evolution.\n\n \n At least you gave up.\n \n Creator is a meaningless term that has an incredible amount of meaning. It was specifically chosen in place of \"God\" as it is non-specific to any religion, or to religion itself in any way.\n \n Creator could be the boogeyman, it might be biological world around me. It in no way, shape, or form relates to the Christian god or a conscious creator.\n \n Waxy",

   "The opening posts of those two threads concerned science, something you claim is irrelevent to God.\n\n Saying that the law of gravity has impact on me is a lot different than saying that I have impact on the law of gravity. You need to understand this before you make this reversal mistake yet again.\n \n \nIf science was truly unrelated to God, then the subject of God shouldn't have come up without provocation, should it?\n\n Whether science is \"truly unrelated\" to God depends on your personal beliefs. Science doesn't care, so to speak; the natural and the supernatural are different realms.\n It would behoove you to quit beating strawmen.\n \n \nIf they agree with THE BIBLE, or don't threaten what THE BIBLE says, then they very well could be right. If not, then the relationship between those who study and translate them must be compared to the various people who brought us piltdown man, nebraska man, neanderthal ape man, peppered moths, Miller-Urey, and countless others that I'm forgetting, or haven't been exposed yet.\n\n Translation: \"I have my answer, despite the evidence.\"\n This is really all that needs to be said to expose your position as both indefensible and unchangeable. Nevertheless, my challenge for you to defend your unsupported assertions remains; your \"argument\" against Kettlewell doesn't stand, as explained extensively below.\n \n \nIf you consider 10 days and 2000 people to be relevent \"actual data and published studies\", in the U.S. you might be considered a liberal!\n\n If you want to dispute the study, provide your own referenced data, or show why the study is flawed. We know you won't do either, but I thought I'd ask again just for kicks.\n \n \nIt's far from being the only case where religion determined that federal dollars do not need to be spent. It's about conservatism - that \"unalienable rights\" thing.\n\n I'd invite you to the Civil Rights forum to discuss this, but you would either (1) run away like a little baby like you did from the Philosophy thread or (2) make unsupported claims about God granting rights without defending any points I question, so why bother?\n \n \nThe \"bandwagon\" may not be as empty as you think. It would be a lot more crowded if it wasn't stifled in schools and universities.\n\n Right, university professors like Dembski and Behe refuse to come out of hiding because-- oh, wait a minute.. They publish books, get publicity, promote their beliefs... (Everything but conduct actual scientific research.. I wonder why that is?)\n \n \nWhat makes this all so confusing is that there is a popular scientist named Kenneth Miller who has many followers, and does not believe in creation. Yet he is referred to as a \"theistic evolutionist\". Catholics can believe in creation and also be referred to as theistic evolutionists. emoticon_confused Looks like dishonesty and spin to me.\n\n He's a theist, and he's an evolutionist. Catholics are theists, and they are evolutionists. These people are theistic evolutionists. This is simple logic, which explains why you're having a hard time understanding it.\n By the way, using the \"dishonesty and spin\" line right after the \"who has many followers\" XXXX just labels you a Grade A Hypocrite.\n \n \nAnd Kenneth Millerism has no problem with barring God from the process.\n\n Please cite the Kenneth Miller quote or quotes that explain that this is indeed his position.\n \n \nNo, you're confusing \"giving up\", with 'proving you wrong in just a few words'.\n\n No, he asked for quotations, and you provided zero quotations. (In fact, he roasted your \"reasoning.\") Given a second chance, you provided zero quotations. You gave up.\n I can count, and Waxy can count, but apparently marc doesn't do too well with big numbers like zero.\n (Ironically, it also appears that you were referring to the wrong document...)\n \n \n \nTonight, I'd rather show you the NY Times article that I referred to above.\n\n Doesn't matter to me. Your XXXX is XXXX no matter which date you post it. \n trebor beat me to it, and I'll add my own observation:\n If there was no natural selection taking place, why would the ratio of melanic to non-melanic morphs have fluctuated in concert with the pollution, independent of Kettlewell's experiments?\n \n \nKettlewell himself decided which moths were safely concealed from birds and which were not.\n\n Depending on what is meant by this somewhat vague statement, this is patently untrue as the moths were captured and counted.\n \n But of course, and thelmoose points out, the NYT article is a mere book review, not a news story reviewing Kettlewell's findings.\n If marc dared, he'd read a thorough dissection of Hooper's claims here. But since he's shown that he simply ignores all of my points to which he can't come up with a response (except for those which he inexplicably thinks he can refute), we aren't expecting anything of him.

Are you sure? As I've said repeatedly, I enjoy making you look foolish. I'm having a blast!\n And, once again, if God cares about science, that's God's prerogative. Science studies the natural; God is allegedly supernatural, and science doesn't delve into that realm.\n \n \nDoes talkorigins qualify? If not, do any of the scientific sources that you refer to get any information from talkorigins?\n\n Silly marc: talkorigins gets their information from scientific journals and defensible articles written by people who cite their sources.\n \n \nSo do Chucky Schumer and Teddy Kennedy.

However, ID's components (IC and SC/CSI) certainly can be roasted beyond recognition; without them, ID has nothing on which to stand.\n \n \nThe main difference I see between Catholics / The Pope, and Kenneth Miller, is that they aren't used as information sources to prove atheism to anywhere near the extent that Kenneth Miller is.\n\n Kenneth Miller proves atheism now? That's pretty remarkable, since he explicitly shows that theism and evolution are compatible.\n (Yes, we realize that you're silently referring to your \"evolution=atheism\" XXXX, but we know you'll never even try to back it up.)\n \n \nYou're as good as electrolyte at proving something. You say it, and it's proven!\n\n If I can't prove anything, why won't you take me up on any of my challenges? If your position is as strong as you want us to think, you wouldn't hesitate. (Instead, you refuse to respond to my posts at all.)\n \n \nOh yes, that's the best way to determine something - the opinions of 4forums readers!! They represent an excellent portrayal of U.S. opinion!!\n\n A reading comprehension problem (at least) it is: Waxy's comment was clearly in regards to whether you supported your point here on 4forums.",
