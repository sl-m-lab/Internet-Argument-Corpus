   "... according to information from the Food and Drug Administration, ... the Blakely, Ga., peanut-processing plant where the problem originated had found salmonella in its products at least 12 times in the past two years. By my count, that's at least a dozen do-overs. The FDA was unaware of this, apparently, because of state and federal reporting regulations so poorly monitored and ill coordinated, the plant could have been shipping out anthrax and no one would have noticed unless a batch happened to end up in Barney Frank's undershorts.\n \n By now, you've probably read about one of these \"loopholes.\" Companies can retest suspect products, get a clear result, and ship them out &#8212; with no one the wiser, apparently, until people start keeling over. Investigators say that's what the plant did when its tests initially revealed a problem.\n \n Here are other \"loopholes\" that emerged during last week's Senate hearings on the crisis:\n \n Food companies and state safety inspectors don't have to report to the FDA when test results find pathogens in a processing plant. Federal investigators found four different strains of salmonella at the Blakely plant.\n \n Companies are required to inform the FDA if they discover contamination after they've shipped a product, but they don't have to notify the feds if the product is still at the plant.\n \n Despite the government's highly touted anti-terror data bases, there's no official data base of food poisonings that local doctors can easily access to check whether a patient's illness is part of a larger outbreak, which might help identify a problem earlier and get suspect items off the shelves quicker. Saving time could save lives.\n \n In fact, the information-gathering process is so cumbersome, the FDA had to invoke bioterrorism laws just to obtain lab tests from Peanut Corp. of America.\n\n SalisburyPost.com - Opinion - Verner column: Peanut butter watchdogs were asleep\n \n Well, Republican Sonny Perdue runs the state of Georgia, and Republican George W. Bush was running the country when these peanuts were being shipped out, and they were responsible for the governmental agencies that weren't doing their job, because Republicans don't want government to work.\n \n They don't give a damn if people die from salmonella or drown in New Orleans.
