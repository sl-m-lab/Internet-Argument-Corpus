   "**\n This thread seems to have degenerated into another empty-headed slanging match, a contest of opposing faiths and belief systems.\n \n Dawkins and other atheists are welcome to their beliefs, just as are christians, muslims, jews, taoists, buddhists, jains, hindus and whoever.\n Systems of belief do not correlate to the individual intellectual abilities of that belief's adherents. You can be really stupid and still be an atheist, or be a genius and still be a Mormon. That is because faith is not related to native intelligence, but to acquired psychological constraints and drives tied to emotions.\n \n So coming back to Dawkins, his cosmological position does not make him particularly bright. A dummy could have exactly the same worldview as he has. If he is intellectually gifted, that gift is to be found in his insights. His talent for self-expression is a given, but that is not the issue. The freshness of his ideas, and the degree to which his reasoning of them is compelling, \n are what marks his intellectual stature. \n \n As far as I can tell, Dawkins speaks to religion and religious cosmology, and says nothing new or fresh at all. He merely says the same ol' same ol' in an entertaining way. The same might be said of a pentecostal preacher, on the other side of the fence.\n \n He also speaks to sociology, anthropology, and realpolitik.His only novel contribution to that, that I can see, is his shortening of the anthropological expression, 'cultural constructs', to a neologism; 'memes'.\n \n He also speaks to the nature of biology and particularly evolutionary biology, and here is where he made his mark by reducing life to a perpetual struggle between bits of acid to preserve and expand their presence in the universe, using the epiphenomena of live organisms to do that job for them. A notion entirely consonant with reductionist materialist mechanist metaphysics, but a notion that, apart from those preconditioned to embrace it, seems a bit of the old, 'reductio ad absurdum' come back to bite him in the butt. IOW, really silly stuff.\n \n Now, I haven't read his stuff for years and years, but if anybody can cite instances of his writing that do demonstrate a penetrating intellect and a formidable grasp of issues metaphysical, biological, and sociological, I'd be glad to take a second look at them.",

A common misconception is that the Theory of Evolution requires a mutation to produce a new trait shortly after that trait becomes necessary. In fact, the trait is often already present and simply becomes more common under selective pressure.\n \n...leading to an improved, or more environmentally friendly species in very few generations compared to what evolutionists have historically taught that random mutation was required to create either original life...\n\n I'm not sure if I read that correctly, but are you saying that the ToE is required to account for the origin of life?\n \n...or new species which was from millions to hundreds of millions of years and based on RANDOM MUTATION. Not INTELLIGENT ADAPTATION based on environmental pressures caused by the Natural World going through cycles and changes caused by such things as Meteor hits, Volcanoes, Tsunami's and other natural catastrophes and natural changes found in Nature.\n\n Just like the intelligent adaption that is going on today to allow people to process an excess of fat, nicotine, and other addictive chemicals...",

And within organized religion, he attacks not only extremist sects but moderate ones. Indeed, he argues that rearing children in a religious tradition amounts to child abuse.\" \n\n \n So if Dawkins personal belief is that YOUR belief is very evil, it doesn't bother you at all? Do you believe he shouldn't be opposed if he politically endorses the removal of children from religious homes? His book apparantly did that, or came very close. As a Christian, you're indifferent to that?\n \n How about this one;\n \n \nFurthermore, in a review of the book written by Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg and published by The Times of London, Weinberg urges Dawkins to realize that religion is not the formidable foe he thinks it is.\n \n \"We are winning, Weinberg encourages Dawkins,\" Mohler wrote in summary of the review. \"Europe is so thoroughly secularized that churches are virtually empty. Americans may look unsecular, but Weinberg sees this as an illusion. After all, millions of Americans claim to be Christians, but have virtually no idea of what Christianity really is. As he explained, 'although most Americans may be sure of the value of religion, as far as I can tell they are not very certain about the truth of what their own religion teaches.' All too true.\" \n\n \n So do you still think that his belief and science are two separate things? Do you see how he uses science to change the belief of others?

Do you agree that humans have not been around from the beginning and that there have been a wide range of creatures that have come and gone and that the general distribution of types of creatures have changed on this planet over such millions to billions of years? If you agree that the distribution of creatures on Earth has changed over millions or billions of years, you presumably say that it was God's guiding hand which drove these changes.

It is a belief in something, and no one has proof that any god is more real than any other.\n\n \n I have received personal proof as evidence that my God is as real to me as you are even though I have never met you. My Father speaks to me and guides me every second of every day of my life. He, the Holy Spirit actually INDWELLS me and lives within me, and fellowships with me moment by moment through out my life. I have spoken in the language of the Angels, prophesied, had what is called a word of knowledge and laid hands on my daughters and healed them of illnesses. Or God healed them through me I should say.\n \n I've had Angelic interventions that protected me for physical harm and danger in my lifetime, and have been guided with answers to important questions when it could only come by a supernatural route. I have more evidence of the reality and personal concern that my Heavenly Father has for me than I would need in 10 lifetimes. And all because I have asked and received His Grace and Mercy which He is only too happy to pour over me like the sweet fragrance he pours over the most fragile flower He created for our pleasure. \n \n What you fail to understand that I have learned my friend is that we are all children of the King of Kings and the Lord of lords. Princes who were made in the image of our Father who is the Most High and the Creator of all that is in Time and Space. We are of Royal Lineage, yet so many live in the spiritual ghetto as orphans who are destitute and without any inheritance at all because they deny their place in the family of the living God and Savior who loves us so much He took on this frail body, lived as a perfect example to prove to us that we can personally live up to His standards and then He died as the perfect lamb of God for our fallen nature to redeem us and return us to himself as clean and white as snow with all of our sins washed away for evermore. All we must do is receive the free gift that He so willingly died for. Then His Holy Spirit lives within us and we are from that point on born again and as sinless and clean as an unblemished lamb in Gods sight. \n \n All you must do to receive the same evidence is to open your heart and receive His truth rather than intellectualize what you would personally prefer to believe for convenience sake. Gods ways aren't mans ways my friend. And neither does the Creator serve the creature, so as long as you insist that God serve and bend to your will, you will never meet Him. I find it very ironic that I'm called arrogant for daring to tell men they are clueless in regards to who the Living God is when those same people do nothing more than create and worship their own form of godliness that fits into and satisfies their personal comfort zones.

However his teachings give us hints on what our position should be: God gave us our brains to do something with them (science which lead to discovering the fact that is evolution), he gave us free will (free from others forcing us to carry and give birth to an unwanted foetus that has no mental existence), and his most important teachings were about love (which is quite prevelant in the whole gay marriage issue, etc.). \n\n \n They are not silent.

Neither of us can prove we are right. Only someone who has no understanding of argumentation or is so full of arrogance believes such a argument will work.

Christanity came from Judaism, it does not mean they worship the same God.\n \n \nAnd you, who has no comprehension of any truth larger than yourself is going to teach me?\n\n \n Larger then myself?

I do not, unlike you, have such a massive amount of arrogance that I expect people to accept arguments I cannot prove that are based entirely upon faith, run contrary to their religious beliefs and are nothing more then a I say so argument. The fact that you think anyone will buy your line of garbage says much about how much experience you have. You rejected the FSM line of reasoning, yet you expect others to accept your argument on the exact same premise. That is hypocracy. The larger issue of your inability to see this is rather disturbing. \n \n \nI'd rather wallow in my ignorance than to submit to your wholesale, feel good, self important, delusional XXXX, thank you very much.\n\n \n Ignorance is bliss I suppose.\n \n \nHere's a deep question for you child.\n\n \n Does it bother you all you have is to attack my screenname?\n \n \nIf a man lives a life time worshiping a man made statue, and after death he finds out that the statue was nothing more than a trinket, did he ever really believe in God at all in Gods opinion ? Or did he waste his life believing in nothing real.\n\n \n If he believed that God to exist, then he believed in a God. Furthermore, wasted time is a subjective view. One wouldn't have worshipped without a benefit to himself. Therefore he did not waste his time worshiping what turned out to be false. \n \n \nOr if you will, as an actual atheist because he ended up finding out that he believed in nothing at all of substance for a lifetime when the living God of life was reaching out to him as he worshiped his puny and very dead statue the whole time.\n\n \n You seem to be unaware of what atheism actually means. I suspect you like Marc9000 just attach that to anything you do not like. One cannot be a atheist and believe in a God or set of Gods. If that man worshipped what he believed to be a God, even it was not, he could not be a atheist. This is a simple conclusion from a understanding of the actual definition. A 5 year old could do this. The fact you actually think this is a 'deep' argument is appalling. \n \n \nHow stupid do you think that man will feel when he suddenly realizes his whole life was wasted believing a lie he himself created in his own mind rather than responding to the living God who created him specifically for fellowship because God loved him so much. Let me give you a hint child, :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead emoticon_xdonno emoticon_cry\n\n \n I suspect that is happening to millions of dead Christians as we speak. Furthermore, as you are clearly ignorant of history, virtually all followers adopted the beliefs of others. They did not create them in their own minds.

It appears that much of your reasoning for your God's existance is founded upon the God of the Gaps argument. Your belief is nothing more then opinion. It is not that we find your belief to be offensive, we find your arrogance to be offensive.

   "Except I could easily say I have done the same except that the truth and God clearly stating your religion is of false idols and false teachings. Neither of us can prove we are right. Only someone who has no understanding of argumentation or is so full of arrogance believes such a argument will work. I made a thread about this very type of argument in the religion section. Perhaps you should check it out.\n \n \n Yes you could say you have done the same thing, but you would be lying because if you had had the same epiphany in life and truly knew HIS TRUTHS you wouldn't be denying what I have clearly said was overwhelming PERSONAL evidence through PERSONAL life experiences with a PERSONAL and LOVING GOD who has dealt with me in very real ways that are and remain undeniable to me. Only you are arrogant enough to now tell me my personal experiences aren't good enough for me to determine my own relationship and acceptance of Him as the Savior of Humanity.\n \n \nIt has to do with your comment about carrying their religion on their backs.\n\n \n Except that I was referring to idol making pagans, not jews in that post. Why can't you accurately interpret the simplest statement I make ?\n \n \n? Oh wait, I can't expect you to understand that, you're a devout conservative christian, history isn't something you consider to be important.\n\n \n Again you must lie and assume slanderous assumptions are true in order to reject and deny the truth. I graduated from Bible College and have studied all of the history, customs and lifestyles of the Ancient World. It is very necessary in order to place the bible in proper historical context. For example, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into heaven. Can you, with all of your knowledge of history place that statement in proper historical context ?\n \n \n \nWrong. Jews do not worship the same God as Christians, nor do Muslims. Christanity came from Judaism, it does not mean they worship the same God.\n\n \n You're right that moslems don't worship the Judeo Christian God of Abraham, and I never implied they do. But very wrong or misinformed to believe that I don't worship the God of Abraham and the Jewish Messiah who is the Christ. Only someone steeped in the deepest ignorance could not be aware of that fact.\n \n \nLarger then myself? Science is larger then myself. The observable world is much larger then myself. I do not, unlike you, have such a massive amount of arrogance that I expect people to accept arguments I cannot prove that are based entirely upon faith, run contrary to their religious beliefs and are nothing more then a I say so argument. The fact that you think anyone will buy your line of garbage says much about how much experience you have. You rejected the FSM line of reasoning, yet you expect others to accept your argument on the exact same premise. That is hypocracy. The larger issue of your inability to see this is rather disturbing.\n\n \n What is so sad is that you dont even see the difference between science and salvation. One is observing that which happens in the World around you and the other is being sensitive to what happens to the soul within you. One deals with the Physical Earth and the other deals with the Supernatural Eternity. How can you expect me to respect someone's intellect who doesn't even know the difference between the two ? \n \n \nIf he believed that God to exist, then he believed in a God. Furthermore, wasted time is a subjective view. One wouldn't have worshipped without a benefit to himself. Therefore he did not waste his time worshiping what turned out to be false.\n \n \n But in the end you obvious child, if one finds out this false god he embraced didn't exist at all, then he will also realize he wasted his whole life believing in nothing at all. Sorry if you can't grasp so obvious a deduction.\n \n \nYou seem to be unaware of what atheism actually means. I suspect you like Marc9000 just attach that to anything you do not like. One cannot be a atheist and believe in a God or set of Gods. If that man worshipped what he believed to be a God, even it was not, he could not be a atheist. This is a simple conclusion from a understanding of the actual definition. A 5 year old could do this. The fact you actually think this is a 'deep' argument is appalling.\n \n \n See above response, AND THINK REAL HARD :xbanghead NKAAAAY ?\n \n \n Not to mention there is no evidence that God even cares, much less exists. You are presenting to hypothetical situations at the same time yet assuming one of them to be true: a man worshiping a false God and a actual God going about its business. The man can be dealt with on its own. Deal with the actual God on its own as well.\n \n \n My whole post that your attacking is full of PERSONAL evidence of how God has dealt with me and proven Himself to me beyond any doubt at all. All you must do to receive the same proof is to reach out to Him with a searching heart seeking HIS TRUTH rather than calling me a deluded liar who has no proof of the truth. That's if you really seek a truth greater than your own that is, and that is the huge question in life for all of us.\n \n \nI never argued they were true. I never argued any God or Gods actually existed. \n \n My point is that your line of reasoning is not only INSANE but hypocritical. You expect people to take upon faith your argument at face value yet you reject other arguments that do the same thing.\n\n \n Nothing insane or hypocritical at all about me sharing my personal experiences with you. What is insane is you projecting as you have because you can't refute my reality, nor can you identify with it. Because of that it scares you so you lash out because \"IGNORANCE CAUSES FEAR\" but you knew that already, right ?\n \n \nYou cannot prove your basis for reasoning even exists.\n\n \n And neither can you prove my personal experiences never really happened to me. All you can really do is seek the eternal truths for your self. And the only way you'll find them is via the Jewish Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth.\n \n \nYou cannot prove your God to exist any more then I can prove the FSM. You will not accept the FSM nor will I accept your God. Only a fool or a completely ignorant arrogant idiot thinks that kind of reasoning is worthwhile.\n\n \n First of all, what is the FSM ? I don't even know what that means. But what you are saying here is that you're very happy wallowing in you self indulgent ignorance with no desire to even learn if the living God is reaching out to you as His child that He loves, and died for 2000 years ago. You are saying you have no desire to know the truth at all. So once again I'll say that even though I can't prove the reality of my God to you, He can prove and reveal Himself to you directly if you will only seek His truth. Not my truth or any other mans truth. Seek Him and He will find you.\n \n Of course that takes a tremendous amount of courage because one must dare to surrender their own will in order to submit to our maker and Father in Heaven. That is why you mock and insult me. You lash out like a coward who must hold on to your will rather than trusting the God of all that is and will be. Just remember child that if you reject Him in this life, He will reject you in the next. Good luck with that my friend, and I sincerely mean that with a true concern for your eternal condition.",

Philosophy. the doctrine that the conduct of human beings expresses personal choice and is not simply determined by physical or divine forces. \n \n \n \n He had a free and independent choice and made a voluntary decision (as did the rest of the angels).

   "Wow, has this strange list of insults finally come to an end.\n \n Let's see now. We started out with a bunch of lectures on evolution and stuff, which were very interesting. Then we devolved into an argument over whether they were really good, nothing new or the work of the devil. We have had the straight foward 'man was created in God's image' argument, with no wiggle room from the Bible's words. We have had the 'God took the scenic route' and actually created evolution to end up with his ultimate creation, man (and woman presumably). And we have had many detours on the way. I think someone out there must have stuck up for the plain and not so simple evolution with no interference theory. We have also had counter arguments that it would be mathematically impossible to create man through some random evolutionary process. However, if you consider that there have been billions upon billions of tiny mutations along with the more rapid environmental adaptation, I would have thought the chances of coming up with absolutely nothing sentient would be very slim indeed.\n \n I won't even touch on the 'I understand God because I have studied real hard' rubbish.\n \n There seems to be something that no-one has mentioned, that I think deserves a mention. Whether you believe the seven day version, or the six billion year version of creation both of which arrive at the creation of 'man', God's legacy, what honestly makes you think that this is it. How arrogant or pretentious can you get to believe that we are the be all and end all of God's creation? That, if there is a god (or many gods) that we are the best he/she/they can do. Evolution is not something that has happened, it is something that is happening. We are just primitive beings that will be superseded by something far more impressive and evidently far more intelligent. In another 100 million years or so, we will be looked back on with the same amusement as some of look back at the dinosaurs.\n \n Just a thought.\n \n Smiley",

They still repeat the same hunting and life skills they have for eons without ever learning there's an easier and better way to accomplish the same things ?\n\n Archie, take a tip: put down the shovel and stop digging. The hole you're in is deep enough already.\n \n Firstly, you can't 'gain intelligence and creativity through the power of reasoning': the power of reasoning is a component of intelligence and creativity, not a means of acquiring them.\n \n Secondly, and far more importantly, if you're going to post about evolution and pose what you think are devastating questions, for Pete's sake learn something about the theory first. NB: the next paragraph is quite long: if you can't be bothered to read it, the point is made more succinctly in the subsequent one.\n \n Through the operation of natural selection on genetic variation arising by, among other means, mutation, the organisms best adapted to prevailing conditions have lower mortality and higher natality: their features accordingly become more frequent in the population. Early hominids adopted bipedalism as an adaptive behaviour, possibly because they spent more time on the ground than their arboreal ancestors and rearing up on your hind legs was a way of detecting predators. Once bipedal, you have a pair of hands freed from acting as platforms and available for developing manipulative skills. Once you have the potential for manipulative skills, there is adaptive advantage in having brains capable of envisaging things to do with them: you then have a positive feedback loop and brain evolution becomes extremely rapid. Add to this an 'opportunistic' ecological niche, and intelligence and creativity as we understand them become highly advantageous traits. For the top carnivores you name this simply wouldn't be the case: what advantage would it confer on a tiger to be able to envisage the making a hand-axe, without hands to shape or use it, or any way of benefitting from its use?\n \n The basic error revealed by your question is the assumption that human intelligence and creativity are the 'goals' of an evolutionary process that was always destined to produce them. Not so: they evolved because they conferred survival value on our ancestors. When we are extinct, they will be gone too.\n \nFor once in your life stop accepting the status quo and ask these common sense questions about why not. Have you ever taken evolution 101 ? They spend the whole course teaching you what questions you must NEVER ASK when studying evolution.\n\n Where on earth did you pick up this idea? I have taken and taught evolution courses for years, and have never been told, or told anyone else, what questions you 'must not' ask. (There is, of course, a difference between questions you 'must not' ask because they are forbidden - as you imply - and questions that are meaningless and based on a misunderstanding of the process: the question of yours that I address above is in the latter category.)",

   "\n Firstly, you can't 'gain intelligence and creativity through the power of reasoning': the power of reasoning is a component of intelligence and creativity, not a means of acquiring them.\n\n \n You see, here's the problem I have with debating pseudo intellectuals. You can't comprehend plain english and you even quote me wrong. This is the quote of what I said below. Precisely what you said in the bolded that I didn't say. Why can't you even understand what I say when all you have to do is read it ?\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Archangel \n What seperates us from animals is our ability to reason through our intelligence and creativity.\n\n \n \nSecondly, and far more importantly, if you're going to post about evolution and pose what you think are devastating questions, for Pete's sake learn something about the theory first. NB: the next paragraph is quite long: if you can't be bothered to read it, the point is made more succinctly in the subsequent one.\n\n \n There ya go again. Just because I disagree with you and have an opposing view you accuse me of not understanding what evo teaches or believes in. When I understand it very well. Notice if you will that you never responded to my questions at all, you just respond by insisting how little I know rather than deal with how little you know.\n \n \nThrough the operation of natural selection on genetic variation arising by, among other means, mutation, the organisms best adapted to prevailing conditions have lower mortality and higher natality: their features accordingly become more frequent in the population. Early hominids adopted bipedalism as an adaptive behaviour, possibly because they spent more time on the ground than their arboreal ancestors and rearing up on your hind legs was a way of detecting predators. Once bipedal, you have a pair of hands freed from acting as platforms and available for developing manipulative skills. Once you have the potential for manipulative skills, there is adaptive advantage in having brains capable of envisaging things to do with them: you then have a positive feedback loop and brain evolution becomes extremely rapid. Add to this an 'opportunistic' ecological niche, and intelligence and creativity as we understand them become highly advantageous traits. For the top carnivores you name this simply wouldn't be the case: what advantage would it confer on a tiger to be able to envisage the making a hand-axe, without hands to shape or use it, or any way of benefitting from its use?\n\n \n Are you locked into a loop or something ? Do you really believe this diatribe of text book fiction is going to impress me ? You seem intent on insisting that we gained intelligence because we stood on our hind legs to see predators coming. This left our hands free to make tools right ? Then explain the Lemur to me. They too stand on their hind legs to watch out for predators and even have hands closely designed like ours. Why then, pray tell haven't they evolved to utilize those hands and reason enough to make tools with them ?\n \n \nThe basic error revealed by your question is the assumption that human intelligence and creativity are the 'goals' of an evolutionary process that was always destined to produce them. Not so: they evolved because they conferred survival value on our ancestors. When we are extinct, they will be gone too.\n\n \n But we are the evidence, the hard and solid proof that our intellect and creativity are possible and where man is concerned very normal. But strangely, in an evolutionary process where we are possible and the reality for higher functioning beings, why is it that after a couple of billion years with so many other creatures evolving along side us, creatures with opposable thumbs, 4 fingers and who also can stand on two legs, why did only we achieve higher function ? What happened to all these other primates and bipedal omnivores who had as many social challenges and environmental pressures on them that would push them forward too never evolved according to their status as closely related siblings to the so called homo sapien, to use your jargon.\n \n \nWhere on earth did you pick up this idea? I have taken and taught evolution courses for years, and have never been told, or told anyone else, what questions you 'must not' ask. (There is, of course, a difference between questions you 'must not' ask because they are forbidden - as you imply - and questions that are meaningless and based on a misunderstanding of the process: the question of yours that I address above is in the latter category.)\n\n \n Again you are either misleading or have been misled yourself. Evo 101 is all about setting the parameters by which evolution is defined. Every question i asked in order to gain an original understanding of how certain processes were possible were rejected as irrelevant to the study. And my questions were simple common sense questions that other students raised their hands in agreement with wanting answers to. But evo 101 isn't there to answer questions. It is simply to define what evo is. Keep in mind I was in a class, but this link makes my point well enough even though it's more extensive info than what was offered to us.\n http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIntro.shtml",

What do they need big brains for, especially when big brains come at a large cost, metabollically speaking.\n\n \n This isn't any type of an intelligent, reasonable or consistent answer at all TQ. It's an excuse or rationalization for why Lemurs haven't evolved on the same path as humans. Isn't it true that according to your totally inconsistent evo that humans first became bipeds in Africa, and hominids too ? Just as the Lemurs flourish there ? And are you suggesting here that none of the Ice Ages that hit the Earth every 10 to 12000 years have ever occurred on the whole Continent of Africa ? Which wasn't even a Continent just a few million years ago. See ?\n http://www.4threvolt.com/EEmovie2.html\n \n Now Lemurs also can be found in numerous Countries and Islands on all Continents proving they too have migrated as man has according to the Social and Environmental pressures that forced us to continue moving and expanding our minds in order to survive the changing World we exist in. All of this according to your own fairy tales of evo which I personally reject as lies, frauds and fairy tales. But I want to use your own accepted science to prove to you that their is no consistency at all in the suppositions and assumptions you make regarding this false science.\n \n So tell me TQ, if i'm nothing more than an ignorant christian who knows nothing about evolution, what does that say about you ? How can you claim to be well versed and has thoughtfully considered all of the possibilities but you neglected to consider how wide spread the Lemurs Habitat is around the World. There are more than 40 species of lemurs on Earth in all climates. Now according to your own evo science, all of those Lemurs came from the same original Genus, whether African or from another part of the World is irrelevant for this discussion.\n \n But they traveled like humans due to Social and Environmental pressures, showed great dexterity and flexibility to have survived such diverse challenges through so many eons. Avoided being hunted into extinction by larger predators who have coexisted with them for all of that time and in all of those places, and through all of those weather pressures. So I ask you again, what would prevent Lemurs with their perfectly formed hands from learning to make and use tools, build structures to live in, reason that weapons can be made to defend themselves from carnivores who have been grabbing them in their mouths for allegedly millions of years and eating them raw ?\n \n That seems like some pretty affective motivation to evolve and at least learn how to make a pointed stick that's well balanced for throwing. Dont you think ? But what do I know, I'm just a dumb christian. Does anyone have any intelligent answers for this conundrum ? And remember, the Lemur is just one animal I have questions about. You geniuses never even touched my question about sharks who are born and raised in the same Ocean yet one lays eggs and the other delivers live born sharks. If you can defend your science with any reasonable answers at all, we'll deal with the marine life next. emoticon_xgood",

So why just us and not the Lemur or the Meerkat, or the Chimp or Great Ape also ? These other creatures went through the same basic path to primate as us. The chimp shares 98% of our DNA. Don't tell me why it hasn't happened because I realize you cant, but tell me why it couldn't happen because if it could, I must assume it would have. The fact is that all of these other species experienced the same pressures as humans with weather changes, Ice Ages, Predatory Challenges and social challenges yet they are still as they were millions of years ago intellectually. Why does their evolutionary progress never lead to them getting smarter as it did for us ? We learn and change and create while they still live by INSTINCT.

Why, with the potentially millions of different species of animals that have existed since the beginning of the evolutionary process, has only one creature evolved to the extent that man has evolved ?\n\n Otto has already addressed this one well enough, I think. Your error lies in the word 'extent', as though there were some goal-directed journey that evolving species were making, and we'd made it further than others. There is no such pre-set path. Intelligence and creativity were selected for in hominids because they conferred adaptive advantage on animals with our ancestors' anatomy, behaviour and ecology. There is no reason to suppose they would confer survival value on most other species. You see human mental capacities as an absolute good in their own right, which other animals have somehow 'failed' to reach. This is not the biological view.\n \nAs to the plasticity of [lemurs'] hands in the first part of your answer. Wouldn't you expect that after using those hands for a couple of hundred million generations that they would lose their plasticity and their dexterity would have increased like ours did ?\n\n I think you might have misunderstood what I meant by plasticity. I was referring to the extent to which they could be altered from their present form without seriously impairing their ability to do what they currently do - run along tree branches.\n \nIsn't that the whole point of evolution ?\n\n There we have your problem in a nutshell. Evolution has no 'point', beyond survival through continuous adaptation to changing conditions. Even that is not a 'point' in the sense of a 'reason for existing', any more than the 'point' of gravity is to make objects fall.\n \nWe learn and change and create while [other animals] still live by INSTINCT. Explain that to me if you can.\n\n I think Otto, TQ and I have explained it several times now, and at some length.\n \nWouldn't it be something if at least two other species of animals had a parallel evolutionary path to ours that had gone beyond their tribal differences to live peacefully with former predatory adversaries as an example to humanity that it can be accomplished ? It bothers me that so many believe we are not above animals yet they can't explain why only we have evolved in intelligence and creativity.\n\n You are imposing culture-bound value judgements on the animal kingdom. There is no law against your doing so, but it leads you to ask questions like the above which simply have no applicability to biological science. If you want examples of organisms 'living peacefully' together, I can refer you to any number of mutualistic relationships between species. In some cases what is now a mutualistic relationship almost certainly started out as a parasite-host relationship; but there was no conscious 'settling of differences' in the establishment of mutualism, just good old natural selection.",

And the natural predators there would avoid me like the plague because I am a human being and I have dominion over this Earth.\n \n So the question isn't why is one animal as fast as the Cheetah, but how marvelous a creature man is that overcame our deficiency by traveling at the speed of sound many times over by now. The question isn't why are Blue Whales so large, because I know God created them that way. But how marvelous is man to have created vessels as large as they are and to have dominated their own domain without even getting wet.\n \n The question isn't how animals survive in Arctic temps but how marvelous is man to have overcome the natural elements and to learn to survive in whatever elements the Earth can throw at us. Even going beyond duplicating the skills of the animal world and conquering outer space which is a vacuum. Man is the only creature on Earth that has seen his own home from outer space, and the only one that ever will.\n \n Here is a spiritual secret that explains mans drive and creativity to reach unheard of goals and accomplishments.

God can go from heaven to Earth with a thought, we, in our fallen state learned to build machines to travel in to accomplish that ability. God can communicate with a thought, we learned to build phones and computers to do it through the air as He does. God is not restrained by time and space and neither will we be if we survive long enough to overcome the obstacle preventing time travel currently. It is our ancient tribal conflicts that will destroy us and our ancient enemy the devil is still attempting to complete the job he started in the Garden of Eden to wipe humanity out. Sadly, there are many people who dont even believe that our true enemy, our sworn spiritual enemy even exists and that our War isn't between flesh and blood but between powers, principalities and beings of darkness and light.

Evolution deals with genes, reproductive ability, and survival capabilities. While it is true that humans are able to survive easily, bacteria and certain insects (e.g. cockroaches) are even better, and if only one of the two groups was to survive, I'd bet on the cockroaches personally. They can adapt faster (in a genetic sense), they can survive nuclear radiation, and they have larger numbers than we do. \n \nAs for Dolphins, pigs, dogs and apes, they are no more intelligent today than they were if they really existed as you insist, a million years ago.\n\n I doubt you could find anyone who would say that they existed a million years ago. They evolved from less-adapted life forms, remember?\n \nAnd as for the speed of a cheetah, I'll race one any time with my harley or car and beat him hands down. And my vehicles can run much longer than the 90 second spurt they can at top speed before needing a rest break. \n \n I will gladly go to the Arctic with my snowmobile, dressed in my goose down one piece coveralls and insulated boots good to 60 below zero, packing my 9 mm Ruger, with one 40 pound back pack loaded with all of the ultra light winter habitat camping gear needed to survive for weeks on end. And the natural predators there would avoid me like the plague because I am a human being and I have dominion over this Earth.\n\n Good for you, but I wouldn't go alone into polar bear territory with only a gun unless I had a guarantee from a deity that I would make it out alive. (This guarantee would have to be signed by that deity before at least three witnesses, by the way.)\n \nSo the question isn't why is one animal as fast as the Cheetah, but how marvelous a creature man is that overcame our deficiency by traveling at the speed of sound many times over by now.\n\n Being adapted in a certain way allowed us to make tools, which led to an accelerating process that continues today. Genetically, though, we are still about as well (or slightly less) adapted as other organisms.\n \nThe question isn't why are Blue Whales so large, because I know God created them that way.

Here for you geniuses who worship at the alter of evolution is an opportunity to make 10,000 dollars. So dont say I never gave you anything. emoticon_xgood \n \n The Argument For Creation:\n \"Just as a building is absolute proof there was a builder (no building ever built itself), creation is absolute proof there is a Creator. The Bible says that God made all things then caused every animal to bring forth \"after its own kind\" (dogs don't have kittens, fish don't turn into birds, etc., no matter how long they are left). The Bible also says, 'Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery already with her in his heart,' and that no liar or thief will inherit the Kingdom of God, warning 'All liars with have their part in the lake of fire.' However, we are told how to be forgiven: \"God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.' Because of the death and resurrection of Jesus, all who repent and trust in Him receive the gift of everlasting life. Intelligent design maintains that the Bible proves its credibility because it is filled with scientific and medical facts written hundreds of years before man discovered them, showing divine inspiration, and confirming its warning of Hell and offer of Heaven.\" www.IntelligentDesignVersusEvolution.com\n \n The Argument For Evolution:\n \"Biological evolution, simply put, is descent with modification. This definition encompasses small-scale evolution (changes in gene frequency in a population from one generation to the next) and large-scale evolution (the descent of different species from a common ancestor over many generations). Evolution helps us to understand the history of life. The central idea of biological evolution is that all life on Earth shares a common ancestor, just as you and your cousins share a common grandmother. Through the process of descent with modification, the common ancestor of life on Earth gave rise to the fantastic diversity that we see documented in the fossil record and around us today. Evolution means that we're all distant cousins: humans and oak trees, hummingbirds and whales. Frogs, birds, rabbits and lizards all have different forelimbs, reflecting their different lifestyles. But those different forelimbs all share the same set of bones - the humerus, the radius, and the ulna.\" http://evolution.berkeley.edu\n \n \"Paleontologists have discovered a new skeleton in the closet of human ancestry that is likely to force science to revise, if not scrap, current theories of human origins. Reuters reported that the discovery left scientists of human evolution . . . confused, saying, 'Lucy may not even be a direct human ancestor after all.\" USA Today, March 21, 2001.\n \"Evolution is a fairy tale for grown-ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless.\" Professor Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research, The Advocate, 8 March 1984.\n \"I myself am convinced that the theory of evolution, especially the extent to which it has been applied, will be one of the great jokes in the history books of the future.\" Malcolm Muggeridge (British philosopher), The Advocate, March 8 1984.\n \"Evolution is unproved and unprovable. We believe it because the only alternative is special creation, and that is unthinkable\" Sir Arthur Keith. Criswell, W.A. (1972), Did Man Just Happen? p. 73, Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan).\n \"Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever. In explaining evolution, we do not have one iota of fact.\" Dr. T. N. Tahmisian (Atomic Energy Commission), The Fresno Bee, August 20, 1959.\n \"Scientists concede that their most cherished theories are based on embarrassingly few fossil fragments and that huge gaps exist in the fossil record.\" Time magazine, Nov. 7, 1977.\n \"As by this theory, innumerable transitional forms must have existed. Why do we not find them embedded in the crust of the earth?\" Charles Darwin, Evolution or Creation, p.139.\n \"If pressed about man's ancestry, I would have to unequivocally say that all we have is a huge question mark.\" Richard Leakey, paleo-anthropologist.\n \"The more scientists have searched for the transitional forms that lie between species, the more they have been frustrated.\" Newsweek, November 3, 1980.\n \"Often a cold shudder has run through me, and I have asked myself whether I may have not devoted myself to a fantasy.\" Charles Darwin, Life and Letters, 1887, Vol. 2, p. 229. \n \"I would rather believe in fairy tales than in such wild speculation.\" Sir Ernest Chain, co-holder of 1945 Nobel Prize for developing penicillin (The Life of Ernest Chain, Ronald W. Clark, pp. 147-148).\n \"The main problem in reconstructing the origins of man is lack of fossil evidence: all there is could be displayed on a dinner table.\" New Scientist, 20 May, 1982.\n A Chinese farmer glued together the head and body of a primitive bird and the tail and hind limbs of a dromaeosaur dinosaur, and in 1999 completely fooled the world-wide scientific community into thinking that they had found the \"missing link\" between carnivorous dinosaurs and modern birds. [National Geographic Magazine, Vol. 196, No. 5, November, 1999]. Named Archaeoraptor, \"this fossil find constitutes the most recent evolution fraud... that we know of. Storrs L. Olson of the Smithsonian Institution said, \"National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic, unsubstantiated, tabloid journalism.\" \n \n The $10,000 Offer\n A transitional form (or missing link) is an example of one species \"evolving\" into another species. Excited scientists thought they had found one when they discovered \"Archaeopteryx.\" The fossil led to the theory that the dinosaurs did not become extinct, but rather all turned into birds. The Field Museum in Chicago displayed what was believed to be an archaeopteryx fossil on October 4-19, 1997. It was hailed as \"Archaeopteryx: The Bird That Rocked the World.\" However, Dr. Alan Feduccia (evolutionary biologist at the University of North Carolina), said, \"Paleontologists have tried to turn Archaeopteryx into an earth-bound, feathered dinosaur. But it's not. It is a bird, a perching bird. And no amount of 'paleo-babble' is going to change that.\" [Science, February 5, 1993]. So here's my challenge: I will give $10,000 to the first person who can prove to me that they have found a genuine living transitional form (a lizard that produced a bird, or a dog that produced kittens, or a sheep that produced a chicken, or even as Archaeopteryx-a dinosaur that produced a bird). Species do not cross, no matter how long you leave them. The whole of creation is proof that evolution is truly \"a fairytale for grownups.\" \n \n Ray Comfort. \n \n email proof@intelligentdesignversusevolution.com\n \n ",

Here for you geniuses who worship at the alter of evolution is an opportunity to make 10,000 dollars. So dont say I never gave you anything.\n\n \n Most of us aren't fraudlent SOBS. You on the other hand I'm not so sure.\n \n \nThe Argument For Creation:\n \"Just as a building is absolute proof there was a builder (no building ever built itself),\n\n \n Therefore God needs a builder. Only XXXXXX use this argument as it requires special pleading to be rational. God's existance is based upon the need for origin yet God needs no origin. If God needs no origin, then its basis for existance no longer exists. This is 5th grade logic. Your argument is hypocritical (just like you) and undermines its very own reasoning.\n \n \nPaleontologists have discovered a new skeleton in the closet of human ancestry that is likely to force science to revise, if not scrap, current theories of human origins. Reuters reported that the discovery left scientists of human evolution . . . confused, saying, 'Lucy may not even be a direct human ancestor after all.\" USA Today, March 21, 2001.\n\n \n Lucy is merely one piece and it is common teaching element. removing it merely forces science to use other less known examples. It changes nothing significent other then replacing one specimen with another. \n \n \n\n \"Evolution is a fairy tale for grown-ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless.\" Professor Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research, The Advocate, 8 March 1984.\n\n \n Check your quotes next time.\n \n \n he beginning of the quotation, \"Evolution is a fairy tale for adults\" is not from Bounoure but from Jean Rostand, a much more famous French biologist (he was a member of the Academy of Sciences of the French Academy). The precise quotation is as follows: \"Transformism is a fairy tale for adults.\" (Age Nouveau, [a French periodical] February 1959, p. 12). But Rostand has also written that \"Transformism may be considered as accepted, and no scientist, no philosopher, no longer discusses [questions - ED.] the fact of evolution.\" (L'Evolution des Especes [i.e., The Evolution of the Species], Hachette, p. 190). Jean Rostand was ... an atheist.\n \n The [end] of the quotation of Professor Bounoure to which you allude is taken from his book, Determinism and Finality, edited by Flammarion, 1957, p. 79. The precise quotation is the following: \"That, by this, evolutionism would appear as a theory without value, is confirmed also pragmatically. A theory must not be required to be true, said Mr. H. Poincare, more or less, it must be required to be useable. Indeed, none of the progress made in biology depends even slightly on a theory, the principles of which [i.e., of how evolution occurs -- ED.] are nevertheless filling every year volumes of books, periodicals, and congresses with their discussions and their disagreements.\" \n \n [Obviously, Bounoure was expressing his distaste at those in his day who argued over the \"principles\" of evolution, \"how\" it took place, whether via Lamarckian or Darwinian \"evolutionism.\" Bounoure probably thought that such \"principles\" were not worth all the \"discussions and disagreements\" since they were not well understood, were yet to be discovered, and perhaps might not be discovered, i.e., if supernatural intervention into the evolutionary process was accepted. Bounoure was a theist. He also probably thought that more practical scientific investigations needed to be pursued and less \"discussions and disagreements.\" - ED.]\n \n As far as we know, Louis Bounoure never served as [\"Director\" nor was even] a member of the CNRS. He was a professor of biology at the University of Strasbourg. Bounoure was a Christian but did not affirm that Genesis was to be taken to the letter. He expressed his ideas in his work. He is clearly \"finalist\" and against all contingent visions of evolution. [\"Finalism\" is a philosophical term related to a belief in ultimate purpose or design behind everything, including, in this case, the evolution of the cosmos and of life. - ED.] He bases his views, among other things, on the existence of elements that are pre-adapted for their future functions. \n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/ce/3/part12.html\n \n Using a fabricated quote. Does Jesus smile upon liars such as yourself?\n \n \n\"I myself am convinced that the theory of evolution, especially the extent to which it has been applied, will be one of the great jokes in the history books of the future.\" Malcolm Muggeridge (British philosopher), The Advocate, March 8 1984.\n\n \n Now if Malcolm Muggeridge had any scientific education he might be of some authority to discuss it. Your quote is similar to someone who's never studied any religion and calling it all false. It is a argument from a position of absolute ignorance. \n \n \n\"Evolution is unproved and unprovable. We believe it because the only alternative is special creation, and that is unthinkable\" Sir Arthur Keith. Criswell, W.A. (1972), Did Man Just Happen? p. 73, Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan).\n\n \n Let's just ignore that the date for that quote is after Sir Arthur Keith had died. Can a dead man give quotes? \n \n \n\"Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever. In explaining evolution, we do not have one iota of fact.\" Dr. T. N. Tahmisian (Atomic Energy Commission), The Fresno Bee, August 20, 1959.\n\n \n There is no reference in any gov't agency website as to the existance of a Dr. T. N. Tahmisian.\n \n \n\"Scientists concede that their most cherished theories are based on embarrassingly few fossil fragments and that huge gaps exist in the fossil record.\" Time magazine, Nov. 7, 1977.\n\n \n Seeing you're zero for a large number, can you provide the actual link to this quote? I can't find it on the Time website and I have a subscription that allows me to search through old editions. \n \n \n\"As by this theory, innumerable transitional forms must have existed. Why do we not find them embedded in the crust of the earth?\" Charles Darwin, Evolution or Creation, p.139.\n\n \n We do. In large numbers.\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC200.html\n \n \n You're zero for a large number.

   "\n \n \n The $10,000 Offer\n A transitional form (or missing link) is an example of one species \"evolving\" into another species. Excited scientists thought they had found one when they discovered \"Archaeopteryx.\" The fossil led to the theory that the dinosaurs did not become extinct, but rather all turned into birds. The Field Museum in Chicago displayed what was believed to be an archaeopteryx fossil on October 4-19, 1997. It was hailed as \"Archaeopteryx: The Bird That Rocked the World.\" However, Dr. Alan Feduccia (evolutionary biologist at the University of North Carolina), said, \"Paleontologists have tried to turn Archaeopteryx into an earth-bound, feathered dinosaur. But it's not. It is a bird, a perching bird. And no amount of 'paleo-babble' is going to change that.\" [Science, February 5, 1993]. So here's my challenge: I will give $10,000 to the first person who can prove to me that they have found a genuine living transitional form (a lizard that produced a bird, or a dog that produced kittens, or a sheep that produced a chicken, or even as Archaeopteryx-a dinosaur that produced a bird). Species do not cross, no matter how long you leave them. The whole of creation is proof that evolution is truly \"a fairytale for grownups.\" \n \n Ray Comfort. \n \n email proof@intelligentdesignversusevolution.com\n \n \n\n The only serious question to be asked here is whether Ray Comfort is deeply dishonest or deeply stupid. (I am aware that 'both' is an option.) We are accustomed to dealing with creationists' straw men, but Comfort here has created a straw giant. Archie, as Comfort isn't around to be asked, it falls on you as his champion to explain to us how the validity of evolutionary theory stands or falls on whether we can produce a dog that gives birth to kittens. Your exposition is eagerly awaited.\n \n As to 'species do not cross, no matter how long you leave them', you and Mr. Comfort might care to look up speciation through allopolyploidy, as instanced by Spartina.",

   "Comfort is yet another shameless hack, as epitomized by his \"banana argument\" for God. (But that's an entirely different belly laugh.)\n \n I had a nutjob hand me this little card one night out on the street. I stayed to roast him. He brought out his anti-evolution book and went down a list of questions to ask evolutionists. I roasted it. Rather than continue their Biblical duty of staying to proselytize, he and his buddy tucked tail and left.\n \n To be blunt, the card is full of it. Most of the claims made on the card are not true at all. Here's a bit you'll like:\n \n \nBIBLE\n The earth is a sphere (Isaiah 40:22).\n \n SCIENCE NOW\n The earth is a sphere\n \n SCIENCE THEN\n The earth was a flat disk.\n\n I call shenanigans.\n Ancient Israel imagined the earth to be a flat disk (Isa 42.5) resting on a foundation or pillars (Job 9.6). It is surrounded by the ocean (Pss 24.2; 136.6). It has four corners (Isa 11.12; Ezek 7.2; job 37.3; 38.13) and an edge (Isa 24.36) or ends (Isa 40.8; Job 28.4; Ps 48.11; Jer 6.22; 25.32). It also has a center or navel (Ezek 38.12). Except for the implication that Jerusalem is the earth's center, ancient Israel's view of the world did not differ from that of other ancient Near Eastern peoples.\n \n - Stuhlmueller, Carroll. The Collegeville Pastoral Dictionary of Biblical Theology, p234. (Collegeville: The Liturgical Press, 1996)\n So not only does the Bible argue against a spherical earth, scholars of the day -- as obvious child points out -- knew full well that the earth was not a flat disk. (See also Eratosthenes, although he wasn't the first.)\n \n \nBIBLE\n Free float of earth in space (Job 26:7).\n \n SCIENCE NOW\n Free float of earth in space.\n \n SCIENCE THEN\n Earth sat on a large animal.\n\n Again, no. As the numerous citations above explain, it is the Biblical position that the earth rests on pillars or on firm foundations of some sort. Scholars didn't ignore that a shadow of an earth-carrying creature never appeared on the moon during lunar eclipses... Instead, religious whackos are trying to rewrite history, just like they do with science. Their approach seems to be: 'If science doesn't support us, we make up sh*t so that it looks like it does. When history doesn't support us, we change it.'",

Stop lecturing people who know far more then you ever will.\n\n \n OK, but really, I can't read and absorb it for you to.\n \n The following study will be a comparison between the concept of Messiah as outlined in the Hebrew Scriptures and that of the Christian New Testament documents. The purpose of this exposition will be to expound upon the Jewish teaching on Messiah in contrast with that of Christianity. The Hebrew Bible gives a clear outline as to who, what, where and how the Messiah will appear. For this reason, we begin with an examination of the Hebrew Scriptures in order to see if whether the Tanakh supports the fact that the Messiah of God is both divine and human, one Person having two natures. We will also examine the Hebrew Bible for the evidence that the Messiah would not only reign as king, but also die a substitutionary death on behalf of sinners, making atonement for sin. As this is being done, we will see if Jesus fits the outline of Messiah presented to us in the Hebrew Bible. \n \n \n Messiah would be the LORD God \n \n Isaiah 9:6 For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\" \n \n This verse points out the inescapable fact that the Messiah is God Almighty appearing in human form. That this passage was considered Messianic is evident from the fact that verse7 says that the Child would sit on the throne of David forever, a description which only fits the Messiah. \n \n In the Targum of Isaiah we read: \"His name has been called from old, Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, He who lives forever, the Anointed One (Messiah), in whose days peace shall increase upon us.\" \n \n Pereq Shalom: R. Yose the Galilean said: \"The name of the Messiah is Peace, for it is said, \"Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\" \n \n Midrash Mishle, S. Buber edition: The Messiah is called by eight names: Yinnon, Tzemah, Pele [\"Miracle\"], Yo'etz [\"Counselor\"], Mashiah [\"Messiah\"], El [\"God\"], Gibbor [\"Hero\"], and Avi 'Ad Shalom [\"Eternal Father of Peace\"] \n \n Whoever this Child is one thing remains certain - This Child must shine forth from Galilee according to Isaiah 9:1: \n 'Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali but in the future He will honor Galilee of the Gentiles, by the way of the sea along the Jordan...'\n \n NOTE: In an attempt to avoid the impact of this passage's significance to the divinity of the Messiah, certain Jewish Publications have translated it in a way as to suggest that the divine titles are not messianic in nature. Rather, they are descriptions of God: \n For a child has been born to us, a son has been given to us, and the dominion will rest on his shoulder; the Wondrous Adviser, Mighty God, eternal Father, called his name Sar-shalom [Prince of peace]. (This appears as Isaiah 9:5 in the Stone Edition Tanakh, Arts Scroll Series, published by Mesorah Publications Ltd.; Brooklyn, NY, 1998) \n \n The great rabbi Ibn Ezra responds: There are some interpreters who say that 'wonderful, counselor, mighty God, everlasting Father' are the names of God, and that only 'prince of peace' is the name of the child. But according to my view, the right interpretation is that they are all the names of the child. (Walter Riggans, Yeshua Ben David [Wowborough, East Sussex; MARC, 1995], p. 370) \n \n Jeremiah 23:5-6 'The days are coming,' declares the Lord, 'When I will raise up to David a righteous Branch, a king who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land. In His days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which He will be called; The Lord our Righteousness (YHVH Tseidkeynu).'\n \n The Targums concluded that this passage was speaking of Messiah. \n \n \n For instance, the great Rabbi David Kimchi wrote in reference to this verse, 'By the righteous Branch is meant Messiah.' The compilers of the Targum agreed with Kimchi since they introduced Messiah by name in this passage. (David Baron, Rays of Messiah's Glory: Christ in the Old Testament [Grand Rapids, MI; Zondervan, 1886], p. 78) \n \n Hebrew scholar Alfred Edersheim quotes other Rabbinic writings in reference to this passage: \n On Jer. xxiii, 5, 6 the Targum has it: 'And I will raise up for David the Messiah the just.' This is one of the passages from which, according to Rabbinic views, one of the names of the Messiah is derived, viz.: Jehovah our Righteousness. So in the Talmud (Babha Bathra 75b), in the Midrash on Ps. xxii.1, Prov.xix.21, and in that on Lamentations I 16. (Edersheim, Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah [Grand Rapids, MI; Eerdmans, 1972], pt. 2, p. 731). \n \n \n Hence, we find the Hebrew Scriptures testifying to the fact that Messiah would be the Lord Himself. (Hebrew YHVH / Adonai) \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Messiah would be the Son of God \n \n Psalm 2:7-8 \"I will proclaim the decree of the Lord: He said to me, 'You are My Son; Today I have begotten thee. Ask of me and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.' \" \n \n The above passage tells us that the Messiah would be the Son of God. \n \n \n \n This fact is also related in the Talmud, Sukkah 52a, Soncino translation: \n \n \"Our Rabbis taught, the Holy One blessed be He, will say to the Messiah, the Son of David (may He reveal Himself speedily in our days), 'Ask of Me and I will give to Thee,' as it is said [Psalm 2:7-8]: 'I will tell of the decree; the Lord hath said unto Me, \"Thou art My Son; This day I have begotten Thee, ask of Me and I will give the nations for thy inheritance.\" ' \" \n \n The Midrash reaffirms the view that Messiah is God's Son when commenting on another messianic Psalm: \n \n Rabbi Nathan said that God spoke to Israel saying, 'As I made Jacob firstborn, for it is written Israel is My son, even My firstborn\" (Exodus 4:22), So also will I make Messiah My firstborn as it is written, \" I will make Him My firstborn.' (Commentary on Psalm 89:27 taken from Midrash Rabbah Shebot ) \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Messiah would be born in Bethlehem Ephratha \n \n \n Micah 5:1 \"But thou Bethlehem Ephratha, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall One come forth unto Me that is to be Ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from old, from Ancient of Days.\" \n \n This verse emphatically states that Messiah would be born in Bethlehem while also having been existing from eternity. \n \n \n The Targum Jonathan (second century A. D.) : \n And You Bethlehem Ephrath, you who were too small to be numbered among the thousands of the house of Judah, From you shall come forth before Me The Messiah, to exercise dominion over Israel, He whose name was mentioned from before, from the Days of Creation. \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Messiah is both Priest and King \n \n Zechariah 3:8-9 NIV 'Listen, O high priest Joshua (Heb.- Yeshua) and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,' says the LORD Almighty, 'and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.'\" \n \n Zechariah 6:9-13 NIV \"The word of the LORD came to me: 'Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak. Tell him this is what the LORD Almighty says: \"Here is the man whose name is the Branch and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the LORD. It is he who will build the temple of the LORD, and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit on his throne. And he will be a priest on his throne. And there will be harmony between the two.\" '\" \n \n Joshua is portrayed as a type of the Messiah who was to come. Hence, just as Joshua is pictured as being both a priest and king, the Messiah would also be a priest who reigns on God's throne as king. In fact, the name \"Joshua\" is the same Hebrew name for \"Jesus\", Yeshua! \n \n The fact that these passages are clearly messianic in nature can be seen in the title given to the one to come, i.e. the Branch. \n The rabbis universally have held that this title refers to the Messiah-King. \n \n Another passage indicating that the Messiah would be both priest and king is Psalm 110:1, 4: \n \n \"The LORD said to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet'... The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.' \" NIV \n \n In fact, David's sons were also called priests: \n \n \"David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people. Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehosphat son of Ahilud was recorder; Zadok son of Ahitud and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was secretary; Beniaha son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David's sons were priests (cohanim).\" 2 Samuel 8:15-18 \n \n Since the Messiah is David's son, this would indicate that he too would be a priest much like his ancestors that preceded him. \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n Messiah would Suffer \n \n While the Hebrew Scripture portrays the Messiah as a glorious King as well as both a human and divine figure, the Bible also indicates that He will suffer and be put to death only to rise miraculously: \n \n Isaiah 52:13-53:12 \"See my servant will act wisely; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted. Just as there were many who were appalled at him - his appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness - so will he sprinkle many nations, and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand. \n \n Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way, and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken. He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the LORD'S will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.\" \n \n Amazingly, this passage declares the fact that the suffering servant is being crushed for the sins of Isaiah's people, eventually being put to death. Yet, vv. 10-11 emphatically state that this servant would once more see \"the light of life\" and reign in order to justify \"his offspring and prolong his days,\" and that \"the will of the LORD\" will \"prosper in his hand\". This seems to imply a bodily resurrection. The only way for the servant to be \"assigned a grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death\" and then \"see the light of life\" is if He were to be miraculously raised from the dead! \n \n NOTE: That this too was considered a messianic prophecy becomes obvious when one reads the rabbinic commentaries. However, in order to avoid the obvious Christian implications, rabbis such as Rashi (Rabbi Solomon Izaak, circa 1040-1105 A. D.) referred this passage to the sufferings of the nation of Israel, despite the fact that rabbis such as the great Maimonides and Crispin thought it was wrong to apply this to Israel. They rather maintained the belief that this passage of Scripture was about Messiah. The reason for Rashi's attempt to make Israel the central focus of this passage was due to his seemingly anti-Christian bias, a fact to which he freely admitted: \n \n \"Since Christians interpret Isaiah 53 as being a prophecy concerning Jesus, we maintain that this is a prophecy concerning the people of Israel.\" (Steve Schwarz, \"Dear Rabbi,\" p.15) \n \n \n \n Rabbi Moishe Alshekh, famous rabbinic scholar who lived in 16th century Sfat states: \"Our Rabbis with one voice, accept and affirm the opinion that the Prophet (Isaiah) is speaking of King Messiah.\" \n \n Furthermore, Rabbi R. Elyyah de Vidas sights, \"The meaning of 'he was wounded for our transgressions, ... bruised for our iniquities' is, that since the Messiah bears our iniquities, which produce the effect of His being bruised, it follows that whoever will not admit that the Messiah suffers for our iniquities must endure and suffer for themselves.\" \n \n Ninth century poet, Eliazer Hakalir, paraphrases Isaiah 53 in a prayer that comprises a part of some Jewish sects' traditional liturgical prayers recited on Yom Kippur (the Jewish Day of Atonement). The prayer begins: \"We are shrunk up in our misery even until now! Our Rock hath not come nigh to us; Messiah our righteousness, hath turned from us; we are in terror, and there is none to justify us! Our iniquities and the yoke of our transgressions He will bear, for He was wounded for our transgressions; He will carry our sins upon His shoulder, that we may find forgiveness for our iniquities; and by his strips we are healed ...\" (Baron, Rays of Messiah's Glory, pp. 225-230) \n \n Midrash Tanhuma and Yalkut, vol. 2, par. 338 on Isaiah 52:13 states that the expressions \"exalted, and extolled and be very high\" indicates that, \"Messiah shall be more exalted than Abraham... more extolled than Moses... and be very high; that is higher than the ministering angels...\" \n \n This again demonstrates that Isaiah 52:13-53:12 was viewed by rabbis as a messianic prophecy. \n \n Also: \"... the weight of Jewish authority preponderates in favor of the Messianic interpretation of this chapter... that until recent times this prophecy has been almost universally received by Jews as referring to Messiah is evident from Targum Jonathan who introduces Messiah by name in chp. LII.13; from the Talmud (Sanhedrin vol. 98b); and from the Zohar... In fact, until Rabbi Rashi [Rabbi Solomon Izaak (1040-1105)], considered the originator of the modern school of Jewish interpretation], who applied it to the Jewish nation, the Messianic interpretation of this chapter was almost universally adopted by Jews...\" (Baron, Rays of Messiahs Glory, pp. 225-229) \n \n \n Interestingly, Isaiah 53 is almost never read in the synagogues, as it is consistently neglected during the Haftorah readings. This is amazing in light of the fact that the chapters preceding and following Isaiah 53 are recited during these special readings. The following list illustrates this point: \n \n Haftorah for Ekeb - Isaiah 49:14-51:3\n Haftorah for Shofetim - Isaiah 51:12-52:12\n Haftorah for Noah - Isaiah 54:1-55:5\n Haftorah for Sephardi ritual - Isaiah 54:1-10\n Haftorah for Hi Tetze - Isaiah 54:1-10\n Haftorah for Re'eh - Isaiah 54:11-55:5 \n \n Herbert Lowe, a Cambridge University Rabbinics Professor notes: \"Quotations from the famous 53rd chapter of Isaiah are rare in the Rabbinic literature. Because of the Christological interpretation given to the chapter by Christians, it is omitted from the series of prophetical lessons (HAFTORAH) for the Deuteronomy Sabbaths. The omission is deliberate and striking.\" (Schwarz, \"Dear Rabbi,\" p.16) \n \n It should also be pointed out that the Haftorah readings are the same throughout synagogues and temples all over the world. \n NOTE - There is evidence that the servant of Isaiah 53 was believed to be referring to national Israel by the Jews even before Rashi. The Church Father Origen writes: \n \n \"I remember that once in a discussion with some whom the Jews regard as learned I used these prophecies. At this the Jews said that these prophecies referred to the whole people as though of a single individual, since they were scattered in the dispersion and smitten, that as a result of the scattering of the Jews among other nations many might become proselytes.\" [Origen, Contra Celsum, I., p. 55 A.D. 248] \n \n Hence, Rashi was seemingly not the first rabbi that tried to apply Isaiah 53 to national Israel.\n \n Zechariah 12:10 \"And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Israel a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look to Me, the One they have pierced, and mourn for Him as one mourns for an only child and grieve bitterly for Him as one grieves for a firstborn Son.\" \n \n An astonishing prophecy indeed! God claims that they will personally pierce Him. Yet, at the same time God refers to the pierced One as someone that is personally distinct from Him for whom the nations mourn and weep as for a firstborn Son. \n \n \n This prophecy is confirmed by the Rabbis to be referring to the other \"Messiah\" which the Talmud calls Messiah Ben Joseph, the suffering Messiah. (T.V. Moore, Zechariah, Haggai and Malachi [Carlisle, PA; Banner of Truth Trust, 1974], p.199) \n \n Edersheim states that this prophecy \"is applied to the Messiah the son of Joseph in the Talmud (Sukk.52a) and so is verse 12...\" (Edersheim, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, [one volume edition], p.737) \n \n T.V. Moore substantiates Edersheim's statement by declaring: \"... the later interpreters explaining it of Messiah Ben Joseph, or the suffering Messiah, whom they invented to meet the passages of Scripture that speak so clearly of this characteristic (i.e.,... the sufferings) of the promised redeemer. But as they believed that this Messiah son of Joseph was a mere man, the difficulty met them that Jehovah declared 'they shall look on ME whom they have pierced', so that if it refers to the Messiah he cannot be a mere man, but must be divine.\" (Ibid., pp.199-200) \n \n Rabbi Moshe Alshekh also confirms the messianic overtones of this prophecy: \n \n \"I will do yet a thing, and that is, that 'they shall look unto me for they shall lift up their eyes unto me in perfect repentance, when they see Him whom they have pierced', that is Messiah, the son of Joseph; for our Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said that He will take upon Himself all the guilt of Israel, and shall then be slain in the war to make atonement in such manner that it shall be accounted as if Israel had pierced Him, for on account of their sin He has died; and therefore, in order that it may be reckoned to them as a perfect atonement, they will repent and look to the blessed One, saying, that there is none beside Him to forgive those that mourn on account of Him who died for their sin: this is the meaning of 'they shall look upon me.'\" (Schwarz, \"Dear Rabbi,\" p.10) \n \n The only person who ever claimed to be both God and the Son of God, as well as being the only self-professed Messiah that was pierced, was Jesus Christ. (cf. John 10:30; Mark 14:61b-62; Luke 24:44-47). \n \n He is the only self-professed Messiah to be born in Bethlehem and to come forth from Galilee. (cf. Matthew 2:1,22; Luke 2:4-7; Mark 1:9) The life of Jesus the Messiah is the only one that bears an amazing correlation to the Hebrew passages being studied. An examination of Psalm 22 and the events surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus as recorded in the New Testament solidifies this point: \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Psalm 22 - The Cucifixion of Jesus \n \n \n Old Testament Prophecy - Psalm 22 New Testament Comparison \n v. 1: \"My God, My God why have you forsaken me?\" Matthew 27:46: \"About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'Eloi, Eloi lama sabacthani?,' which means, 'My God, My God why have you forsaken Me?' \" \n 6-8: \"But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by people. All who see me mock me. They hurl insults shaking their heads; 'He trusts in the Lord, let the Lord rescue Him. Let Him deliver Him, since He delights in Him.'\" Matthew 27:41-44: \"In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the Law and the Elders mocked Him. 'He saved others.' they said, 'But He can't save Himself! He's the King of Israel! Let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him. He trusts in God, let God rescue Him now if He wants Him, for He said \"I am the Son of God.\" ' In the same way the robbers who were crucified with Him also heaped insults on Him.\" \n 14-15: \"I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint, my heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.\" \n \n (NOTE - This is a precise description of the crucifixion process where the hanging weight of a person's body would eventually cause his bones to come out of joint, and would make him as one lying in the \"dust of death\") John 19:34: \"Instead one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.\" \n \n (NOTE - Medically the flow of blood and water would mean that the heart of the person had literally burst , i.e. had \"turned to wax\" and \"melted away\", in complete fulfillment of this verse of the Psalm!)\n \n John 19:28: \"Later, knowing that all was completed, and so that the scripture may be fulfilled, Jesus said, 'I am thirsty.' \" \n 16: \"Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men have encircled me; they have pierced (kaaru) my hands and feet.\" \n (NOTE - This prediction was made when crucifixion did not even exist at the time!) \n \n 17-18: \"I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me. They have divided my garments and cast lots for my clothing.\" \n John 19:23-24: \"When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took His clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. 'Let's not tear it,' they said to one another, 'let's decide by lot who will get it.' \" \n \n Even more amazing still is the fact that the Psalmist indicates that after suffering all this pain and torture which eventually causes the sufferer to lie in \"the dust of death\", the sufferer will then be able to proclaim the name of God in the sacred assembly: \n \n \"I declare your name to my brothers; in the congregation I will praise You\" (v. 22) \n \n The only way for the sufferer to die and yet give glory to God in front of his brethren is if he were to be resurrected! Jesus Christ is the only man in history to have been raised from the dead to immortal glory. In fact, upon rising from the dead Jesus proceeded to declare God's name to His unbelieving brethren who became the Apostles that helped evangelize the world! Therefore, He is the only one who has fulfilled this prophecy. \n \n \n The Pesikta Rabbati, Piska 36: 1-2: affirms that Psalm 22 was viewed as a messianic prophecy: \n \n \"(At the time of the Messiah's creation) the Holy One, blessed be He, will tell Him (Messiah) in detail what will befall Him: There are souls that have been put under My throne, and it is their sins which will bend Thee under a yoke of iron and make thee like a calf whose eyes grow dim with suffering... During the seven year period preceding the coming of the Son of David, iron beams will be brought and loaded upon His neck until Messiah's body is bent low... It was the ordeal of the Son of David that David wept, saying, 'My strength is dried up like a potsherd.'\" \n \n In refutation of certain Jewish claims that Psalm 22:16 should more correctly read as lions (kaari), instead of pierced (kaaru), we find this passage in the Yalkut Shimoni (687): \"'Many dogs have encompassed me'- this refers to Haman's sons. 'The assembly of the wicked have enclosed me'- this refers to Ahasuerus and his crowd. 'Kaari my hands and feet'- Rabbi Nehemiah says, 'They have PIERCED my hands and feet in the presence of Ahasuerus.'\"\n \n (NOTE- It should be stated that the early Greek Septuagint [compiled nearly three centuries before the birth of Christ], Syriac and Latin versions of the Hebrew Scriptures all read \"pierced.\")\n \n Alfred Edersheim observed a remarkable comment in Yalkut on Isaiah 60 which applies this passage in Psalm 22 to the Messiah, and uses almost the same words as the Gospel writers in describing the mocking behavior of the surrounding crowds. (Edersheim, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, p. 718) \n \n \n This is a clear indication that certain rabbis viewed Psalm 22 as a messianic prophecy. \n \n This apparent paradox has puzzled the Jews from the very beginning, since they could not understand how a triumphant King-Messiah could suffer and die. As noted earlier, this paradox led to the belief that there would be two distinct Messiahs to fulfill two distinct roles; the Suffering-Messiah Ben Joseph, and King-Messiah Ben David. Yet the truth is that there is only Messiah, Yeshua ha-Mashiach whose mission has been to fulfill both these roles. The first mission was to fulfill the role of the Suffering Servant, while his role as reigning King is to be fulfilled at his Second Coming. (Cf. Matthew 24:27-35). \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n The Timeline of Messiah \n \n Through the prophet Daniel we receive a timeline of when Messiah would appear: \n \n (Daniel 9:24-26) \"Seventy sevens are decreed for your people and the Holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most Holy. Know and understand this; from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One (Messiah), the Ruler comes, there will be Seven sevens and Sixty-two sevens. After the sixty-two 'sevens,' the Anointed One will be cut off and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed. \" \n \n Daniel is given the allotted time for a) the decree of the rebuilding of both the city and the temple, b) the time it would take for the Messiah to appear after this decree, as well as c) the destruction of the temple and the termination of the Messiah's life. Several dates have been given as a starting point for the period of time stated in the book of Daniel (7 * 7 = 49 + 62 * 7 = 434 - total = 483). \n \n One such date is King Cyrus's decree to rebuild the temple in 539 B. C. Yet, none of these dates are correct since the dates that are commonly given refer to the rebuilding of the temple, not the city. The prophecy clearly states that the time frame would begin only when the decree goes forth for the rebuilding of the city and its walls. The only decree that fits the context of the prophecy is that of Artaxerxes to Nehemiah in 444 B. C. (Nehemiah 2:1-8), since this decree included the restoration of the city and the city gates as well as its walls. \n \n The following quotation from the book \"Evidence That Demands a Verdict\" by Josh McDowell, helps illustrate Daniel's amazing timeline: JPN Note: \n The Hebrew and Babylonian calendar at that time used a 360 day year. The use of this 'prophetic year' in these prophecies is confirmed by comparing the 1,260 days (Rev 11:3, 12:6) with the 42 month (Rev 11:2, 13:5) and with the 'time, times, and half a time' or three and a half years of Dan 7:25, 12:7, Rev 12:14). \n \n \"If Daniel is correct, the time from the edict to restore and rebuild Jerusalem (Nisan 1, 444B.C.) to the coming of the Messiah to Jerusalem is 483 years (69 * 7), each year equaling the Jewish prophetic year of 360 days (173,880). The terminal event of the 69 weeks is the presentation of Christ Himself to Israel as the Messiah as predicted in Zechariah 9:9. H. Hoehner, who has thoroughly researched this prophecy in Daniel and the corresponding dates, calculates the date of this event: \n \n 'Multiplying the sixty-nine weeks by seven years for each week by 360 days gives a total of 173,880 days. The difference between 444B.C. and A.D.33 then is 476 solar years. By multiplying 476 by 365.24219879 or by 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45,975 seconds (there are 365 1/4 days in a year), one comes to 173,885 days, 6 hours, 52 minutes, 44 seconds, or 173,885 days. This leaves only 25 days to be accounted for between 444B.C. and A.D.33. By adding the 25 days to March 5 (of 444B.C.), one comes to March 30 (of A.D.33) which was Nisan 10 in A.D.33. This is the triumphant entry of Jesus into Jerusalem.'\" (McDowell, p. 173) \n \n This prophecy once again predicts Messiah's brutal death: \n \n \"After the sixty-two sevens, the Anointed One will be cut off (yikaret) and have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary (temple).\" (cf. Daniel 9:26) \n \n The Hebrew term, yikaret, implies a sudden, violent death. This is a precise description of Jesus' brutal death on the cross. Another astonishing aspect deals with the fact that the Temple was destroyed some forty years after Christ's crucifixion; clearly fulfilling Daniel's prediction of the \"sanctuary\" being demolished right after the death of the Messiah! Hence, Jesus must be the Messiah since the prophecy clearly states that the Messiah must appear before the destruction of the second Temple. The only person who fits the bill is Jesus Christ, since He is the only one who claimed that his death was essential in providing the atonement that was both necessary to usher in God's everlasting righteousness and to eradicate sin. \n \n Furthermore, any denial of Jesus' Messiahship is essentially a denial of Daniel's authenticity as a prophetic book since the condition of the prophecy rests upon the arrival of the Messiah before the Temple's destruction. Yet, if Jesus is not Messiah then Daniel is proven to be a false prophet since the Temple has been destroyed and the Messiah has not come. Hence, once the weight of historical occurrences and mathematical calculations is thrown behind the prophecies of the Bible, it becomes increasingly impossible to deny the fact that Jesus is the promised Messiah. \n \n \n \n Additional confirmation of the messianic overtones of Daniel 9:25-27 comes from the Talmud itself: \n \n \"In Daniel is delivered to us the end ['the time of His appearance and death' - Rabbi Jarchi] of the Messiah.\" The Talmud also records that about the time of the Roman general Titus' destruction of the Temple (70 A. D.), the Messiah was believed to have already come, yet His identity was concealed from the Jews until they were rendered more worthy of His appearance!\" (Frank Delitzch and Paton Gloag, The Messiahship of Christ / The Messianic Prophecies of Christ [Minneapolis, MN; Klock & Klock, 1983 rpt.], pt. 2, p. 226) \n \n Rabbi Moses Abraham Levi stated: \"I have examined the Holy Scriptures, and have not found the time for the coming of the Messiah, clearly fixed, except in the words of Gabriel to the prophet Daniel, which are written in the ninth chapter of the prophecy of Daniel.\" \n \n Rabbi Azariah states in the words of Daniel: \"To seal the vision and prophecy, and to bring in Messiah our righteousness.\" \n \n Rabbi Nachmonides claims: \"This Holy of Holies is the Messiah who is sanctified more than the sons of David.\" \n \n Finally, in the words of Jonathan ben Uzziel: \"That the 'vision and prophecy' may be fulfilled even unto Messiah, the Holy of the Holies.\" \n \n This again strengthens the case for the Messiahship of Jesus since He is the only person that both claimed to be the suffering Messiah that was to die and who appeared before the year 70 AD. \n \n In fact Rabbi Nehumias, who lived 50 years before Christ, is cited as saying that the time given by Daniel for the Messiah's appearance could not go beyond fifty years! (Ibid.)\n LOOK: Another amazing fact is that the Talmud admits that forty years prior to the destruction of the Temple, God refused to accept the high priestly sacrifices: \n \n \"Our Rabbis taught that throughout the forty years that Shim'on the Tzaddik served ... the scarlet cloth would become white. From then on it would sometimes become white and sometimes not ... Throughout the last forty years, before the Temple was destroyed ... the scarlet cloth never turned white.\" (Yoma 39a-39b) \n \n \n \n Is it then a mere coincidence that approximately forty years prior to the Temple's destruction, Yeshua the Messiah offered himself as the final and perfect sacrifice, making void all other sacrifices offered up by the cohen ha-gadol (the high priest)? The Talmud alludes to the reason why God allowed the Temple to be destroyed: \n \n \"Why was the Second Sanctuary destroyed, seeing that in its time they occupied themselves with studying Torah, obeying mitzvot and practicing charity? Because in it prevailed hatred without a cause.\" (Yoma 9b) \n \n This echoes Jesus' very own words as recorded in the Gospel of John: \n \n \"But now they (the Jewish ruling council) have seen these miracles and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.'\" John 15:24b-25 \n \n Thus, the evidence from the rabbinic commentaries points to the same inescapable conclusion. Namely, that Jesus of Nazareth is the prophesied Jewish Messiah. To make the case for the Messiahship of Jesus that much stronger, we provide the additional prophecies and their fulfillment in the life of Jesus.\n Genesis 49:10: \"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Law-giver from between His feet until Shiloh come.\" \n \n \n Targum Onkelos states: \"He who excerciseth dominion shall not pass away from the house of Jehuda, nor the saphra from his children's children until the Messiah come.\" \n \n Additionally, the Targum Jerusalem declares that, \"Kings shall not cease from the house of Jehuda... until the time that the King Meshiha shall come... How beauteous is the King Meshiha who is to arise from the house of Jehuda.\" \n \n Finally, the Targum Palestine indicates: \"Kings shall not cease, nor rulers from the house of Judah ... nor sapherim teaching the Law from his seed, till the time that the King the Messiah shall come, who will arise from Jehuda.\" \n \n In fact one of the names of Messiah is Shiloh, a name derived from this very passage: R. Johannan asked what was the name of the Messiah; they of the school of R. Schilo answered, \"His name is Shiloh, according to that which is written, 'until Shiloh come.'\" (Sanhedrin 98b) \n \n \n Thus, according to this passage, two things would take place following the appearance of the Messiah: \n \n 1. Removal of the scepter or identity of Judah. \n 2. Suppression of the judicial power. \n \n NOTE: Although Israel suffered 70 years of captivity under Babylonian rule, it never ceased from having its \"tribal staff,\" since they still had their own lawgivers and judges. (cf. Ezra 1:5, 8) The removal of Judah's scepter came during the reign of Herod the Great who, having no Jewish blood, succeeded the last reigning Jewish leaders in Jerusalem; the Maccabean princes of Judah. Secondly, the legal right of pronouncing death upon criminals was stripped away from the Jews in 7 AD., approximately 23 years before Christ's crucifixion. This nullified their judicial authority to execute lawbreakers. \n \n The Talmud itself admits this: \"... a little more than forty years before the destruction of the Temple, the power of pronouncing capital sentence was taken away from the Jews.\" (Sanhedrin, Fol. 24, recto.) \n \n NOTE: The Jews realized the significance and impact of the situation as Rabbi Rachmon notes: \n \n \"When the members of the Sanhedrin found themselves deprived of their right over life and death, a general consternation took possession of them; they covered their heads with ashes, and their bodies with sackcloth, exclaiming: Woe unto us, for the scepter has departed from Judah, and the Messiah has not come!'\" (Babylonian Talmud, San. Chpt. 4, Fol. 37, recto.) \n \n The fact of the matter was that the Messiah had already arrived and was a young 12 year old Jewish boy living in Nazareth whose name was Jesus! (For further reading see Evidence That Demands a Verdict, vol. 1, pp.168-170) \n \n \n Jewish Scriptures & Thought New Testament Comparison \n Other quotations taken from the Jewish Scriptures include the promise of Isaiah 42:1-9 that God's Spirit would dwell on the Messiah. One Targum state \"Behold my Servant Messiah, I will draw Him near, My chosen One, in whom my Memra (Aramaic- \"word\") is well pleased.\" The identification of God's Word with the Messiah is similar to what the Apostle John states in his prologue: \n \n \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... and the Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.\" John 1:1, 14 \n Another tradition states that the world was created for Messiah: \n \n \"Rabbi Yohanan taught that all the world was created for Messiah. What is His name? The school of Sheeloh taught; His name is Shiloh as it is written (Gen. 49:10).\" Sanhedrin 98b This also agrees with what the New Testament states: \n \n \"For by Him (Jesus) all things were created: Things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by Him (Jesus) and for Him (Jesus).\" Colossians 1:16-17 (cf. John 1:1-4; Hebrews 1:2) \n The Yalkut states: \n \n \" 'And God saw the light and it was good.' This is the Light of the Messiah... to teach you that God saw the generation of Messiah and His works before He created the universe, and He hid the Messiah... under His throne of Glory. Satan asked God, Master of the Universe: 'For whom is this light under your throne of Glory?' God answered him, 'It is for... [the Messiah] who is to turn you backward and who will put you to scorn with shamefacedness.\" (Sanhedrin 99a; Berachot 34b; Shabbat 63a) Compare this with Jesus' statements: \n \n \"While I (Jesus) am in the world, I am the Light of the world.\" John 9:5 (cf. John 1:4-5) \n Finally, the Rabbis confirm that the prophets wrote only in regards to the future advent of the long-awaited Messiah: \n \n \"Rabbi Chiyya ben-Abba said in Rabbi Yochanan's name: 'All the prophets prophesied [the good things] only for the days of the Messiah...'\" (Sanhedrin 99a; B'rakhot 34b) In the words of Jesus Christ himself: \n \n \"You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.\" John 5:39-40 \n \n \n From the preceding examples and prophecies one thing remains certain. Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God. As the High Priest himself found out when questioning Jesus at His trial: \n \n \"Are You the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?\" \n \n To which Jesus replied: \n \n \"I AM, and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming with the clouds of heaven.\" Mark 14:61b-62 \n \n He's coming back! Are you prepared to meet Yeshua ha-Mashiach, Ha Adonai, Ben Elohim? We pray that you are. \n ",

   "The Third Temple hasn't been rebuilt yet. It wont happen untill the 7 year Tribulation period takes place in the very end of this Age. Literally the final 7 years of this present Age.\n \n Appendix A\n Isaiah 53: Of Whom Does The Prophet Speak? \n \n We present additional Jewish references that uphold the messianic interpretation of Isaiah 53. \n \n According to an ancient Jewish tale, God asked Messiah if he wanted to take upon himself the suffering for Israel's sins. The Messiah replied, \n \n \"With gladness in my soul and with joy in my heart I accept it, so that not a single one of Israel should perish; and not only those who will be alive should be saved in my days, but even the dead who have died from the days of Adam the First man until now.\" (Raphael Patai, The Messiah Texts, citing Pesikta Rabbati, pp. 161a-b) \n \n Sanhedrin 98b:The rabbis say: \"The Leprous of the House of study is his name, as it is said, verily he has borne our diseases and our pains - he carried them and we thought him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted.\" \n \n According to another legend, Elijah will take the head of the dead Messiah Ben David, placing it on his lap and say: \"Endure the suffering and the sentence of your Master who makes you suffer because of the sin of Israel.\" \n \n The story then concludes with a quotation from Isaiah 53:5: \"... he was wounded for our transgressions.\" (Patai, The Messiah Texts, p.115) \n \n Midrash Rabbah on Ruth 2:14: He is speaking of the King Messiah: \"Come hither\" draw near to the throne and \"dip thy morsel in the vinegar,\" this relates to the chastisements as it is said, \"But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities.\" \n \n Midrash Tanhuma, Parasha Toldot, (end of section), states: \"Who art thou, O great mountain?\" (Zech. 4:7) This refers to King Messiah. And why does he call him the \"great mountain?\" Because he is greater than the patriarchs, as it is said, \"My servant shall be high, and lifted up, and lofty exceedingly.\" He will be higher than Abraham who said, \"I raise high my hand unto the Lord\" (Gen. 14:22), lifted up above Moses, to whom it is said, \"Lift it up into thy bosom\" (Num. 11:12), loftier than the ministering angels, of whom it is written, \"Their wheels were lofty and terrible\" (Ezek. 1:18). And out of whom does he come forth? Out of David. \n \n Jewish educator Herz Homberg (1749-1841) states: According to Ibn Ezra, it relates to Israel at the end of their captivity. But if so, what can be the meaning of the passage, \"He was wounded for our transgressions?\" Who was wounded? Who are the transgressors? Who carried out the sickness and borne the pain? The fact is that it refers to the King Messiah. \n \n Nachmanides (R. Moshe ben Nachman) (13th c.) notes: \"The right view respecting this Parasha is to suppose that by the phrase 'my servant' the whole of Israel is meant... As a different opinion, however, is adopted by the Midrash which refers to the Messiah, it is necessary for us to explain it in conformity with the view there maintained. The prophet says, The Messiah, the son of David of whom the text speaks, will never be conquered or perish by the hands of his enemies. And, in fact the text teaches this clearly... And by his stripes we are healed - because the stripes by which he is vexed and distressed will heal us; God will pardon us for his righteousness, and we shall be healed both from our own transgressions and from the iniquities of our fathers.\" (S. R. Driver and A. Neubauer, ed., The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters [2 volumes, NY; Klav, 1969], p. 78 f.) \n \n The Karaite Yefeth ben Ali (10th c.) states: As to myself, I am inclined, with Benjamin of Newahend to regard it as alluding to the Messiah, and as opening with a description of his condition in exile, from the time of his birth to his ascension to the throne: For the prophet begins by speaking of his being seated in a position of great honour, and then goes back to relate all that will happen to him during the captivity. He thus gives us to understand two things: In the first instance, that the Messiah will only reach his highest degree of honour after long and severe trials; and secondly, that these trials will be sent upon him as a kind of sign, so that, if he finds himself under the yoke of misfortunes whilst remaining pure in his actions, he may know that he is the desired one... (Ibid., pp.19-20) \n \n Again from Ali: By the words \"surely he hath carried our sicknesses,\" they mean that the pain and sickness which he fell into were merited by them, but that he bore them instead... And here I think it necessary to pause for a few moments, in order to explain why God caused these sicknesses to attach themselves to the Messiah for the sake of Israel... The nation deserved from God greater punishment than that which actually came upon them, but not being strong enough to bear it...God appoints his servant to carry their sins, and by doing so lighten their punishment in order that Israel might not be completely exterminated. (Ibid., p. 23, f.) \n \n And, \"And the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all.\" The prophet does not say avon meaning iniquity, but punishment from iniquity, as in the passage, \"Be sure your sin will find you out.\" (Num. Xxxii. 23) (Ibid., p. 26) \n \n Maimonides himself affirmed the messianic interpretation of Isaiah 53. (Ibid., vol.1, p. 322) \n \n Finally, the idea that God would place the sins of Israel upon an innocent man is alluded to in this Midrash: Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be he, 'Will not a time come upon when Israel will have neither Tabernacle nor Temple? What will happen to them (as regards atonement)?' He replied, 'I will take a righteous man from amongst them and make him a pledge on their account, and I will atone for their iniquities.' (Midrash on Exodus 35:4) \n \n \n Hence, there can be not one single doubt remaining as to whom Isaiah speaks of: namely, the Messiah whose name is Jesus. Another attempt to avoid the messianic overtones of these biblical passages is the argument that the passages in question speak of these events as having already been transpired. These prophecies are in the past, and therefore cannot be referring to the future advent of the Messiah. The problem with this argument is that biblical Hebrew does not have a past tense since it is not a \"tense\" language. Hebrew scholars have come to recognize that biblical Hebrew is an \"aspectual\" language. This implies that the same form of the verb can be translated as past, present, or future depending on the context and various grammatical constructions. \n \n Hence, it is simply wrong to argue that because these prophecies are spoken of as having already transpired that it does not refer to the Messiah. In fact, there are many examples in the Hebrew Bible where the \"past tense\" form (called \"the perfective\" or \"perfect\") is used for future time. In support of this, we quote the following Rabbis and Grammarians: \n \n \n David Kimchi on the prophets' use of the perfect tense for future events: \"The matter is as clear as though it had already transpired.\" (Kimchi, Sefer Mikhlol as cited in Bruce K. Waltke and Michael Patrick O'Connor, An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax [Winona Lake, IN; Eisenbrauns, 1990], p.64, n. 45) \n \n Rabbi Isaac Ben Yedaiah (13th c.): [The rabbis] of blessed memory followed, in these words of theirs, in the paths of the prophets who speak of something which will happen in the future in the language of the past. Since they saw in prophetic vision that which was to occur in the future, they spoke about it in the past tense and testified firmly that it had happened, to teach the certainty of his [God's] words- may he be blessed- and his positive promise that can never change and his beneficent message that will not be altered. (Marc Saperstein, \"The Works of Rabbi Isaac b. Yedaiah.\" Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, 1977, pp. 481-82 as cited by Robert Chazan in Daggers of Faith [Berkeley; UC Press, 1989], p. 87) \n \n Contemporary Jewish commentator Nahum Sarna on Exodus 12:17: \"This is an example of the 'prophetic perfect.' The future is described as having already occurred because God's will inherently and ineluctably possesses the power of realization so that time factor is inconsequential.\" (Exodus: The Traditional Hebrew Text with the New JPS Translation [Philadelphia; Jewish Publication Society, 1991], p. 59) \n \n Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (sec. 106n, pp. 312-3113): More particularly the uses of the perfect may be distinguished as follows:-... To express facts which are undoubtedly imminent, and therefore in the imagination of the speaker, already accomplished (perfectum confidentiae), e.g., Nu 17:27, behold we perish, we are undone, we are all undone. Gn 30:13, Is. 6:5 (I am undone), Pr 4:2... This use of the perfect occurs most frequently in prophetic language (perfectum propheticum). The prophet so transports himself in imagination into the future that he describes the future event as if it had been already seen or heard by him, e.g. Is 5:13 therefore my people have gone into captivity; 9:1ff., 10:28, 11:9...; 19:7, Jb 5:20, 2 Ch. 20:37. Not infrequently the imperfect interchanges with such perfects either in the parallel member or further on in the narrative. \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Appendix B\n The Messiah and the Second Temple \n \n As we have already indicated, the Hebrew Bible in such passages as Daniel 9:26 clearly place the appearance of the Messiah before the destruction of the second temple. This fact is clearly brought out in the following two passages: \n \n Zech 2:1-9 \"On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai: 'Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them, \"Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing? But now be strong, O Zerubbabel,\" declares the LORD. \"Be strong, O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,\" declares the LORD, \"and work. For I am with you,\" declares the LORD Almighty. \"This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.\" This is what the LORD Almighty says: \"In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land. I will shake all nations, and the desired of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,\" says the LORD Almighty. \"The silver is mine and the gold is mine,\" declares the LORD Almighty. \n \n Haggai 2:1-9 NIV \"The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,\" says the LORD Almighty. \"And in this place I will grant peace,\" declares the LORD Almighty.'\" \n \n God declares that the second temple would be greater in glory than that built by Solomon. This is due to the coming of the one who is called \"the desired of the nations.\" Some translators view the statement in v. 7 as not referring to the Messiah, but rather the splendor in which the second temple would be adorned with, i.e. the gold and silver of the nations. The only problem with this view is that this in no way would make the second temple greater than the first. The reason is that Solomon's temple was also arrayed with the finest and most precious materials. Furthermore, the visible manifestation of the glory of God appeared in the form of a cloud and filled the entire sanctuary. (Cf. 1 Kings 8:10-11) \n \n Yet, God specifically states that the glory of the second temple would be greater than the first. What could possible be greater than the cloud descending on Solomon's temple than God appearing as man in the person of the Messiah at the second one? In the words of Yeshua: \n \n \"I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.\" Matthew 12:6 \n \n That Haggai 2:6-9 was viewed as a messianic prophecy can be seen in this citation from Sanhedrin 97b: \n \"Rabbi Akibah made the inference, from the verse, 'Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land' (Haggai 2:6), that Simon Bar Koziba was the Messiah, though he reigned only for two and half years.\" \n \n In spite of Akibah's error that Koziba was the Messiah, his usage of Haggai 2:6 clearly affirms that at least one rabbi understood this passage as messianic. \n \n The prophet Malachi predicted that God would personally appear at the second temple: \n \"See I will send my messenger who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant whom you desire will come, says the LORD Almighty.\" Malachi 3:1 \n \n According to this prediction, the Lord himself was to come and enter his temple. \n Rabbi Mosheh ben Maimon applied this to the Messiah: \"What is to be the manner of Messiah's coming, and where will be the place of his first appearance? He will make his first appearance in the land of Israel, as it is written, 'The LORD whom ye seek will come suddenly to his temple.'\" \n \n In fact, some rabbis were of the opinion that the Messiah had even been born during the destruction of the second temple: \n \"Rabbi Shemuel bar Nehmani said: On the day when the Temple was destroyed Israel suffered much for their sins... And from whence do we know that on that day (when the Temple was destroyed] Messiah was born? For it is written, 'Before she travailed, she brought forth [the Messiah].' \" Bereshit Rabbati 133 (Isaiah 66:7) \n \n The Talmud of Babylon declares: \"R. Hillel says there will be no Messiah for Israel, because they have enjoyed him already (fol. 99, col. 1) in the days of Hezekiah. Said Rav. Joseph, may God pardon R. Hillel. When was Hezekiah? In the first house, but Zechariah (9:9) prophesied in THE SECOND HOUSE Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout O daughter of Jerusalem; Behold thy King cometh unto thee; He is just and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an XXX, and upon a colt, the foal of an XXX.' \" (Sanhedrin fol. 99, c. 1) \n \n \n The only person who claimed to be the divine Messiah and appeared while the second temple was still standing is Yeshua Messiah: \n \n \"When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord... Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ. Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was the custom of the Law required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: 'Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all people, a light of revelation to the Gentiles and for the glory to your people Israel.'\" Luke 2:22, 25-32 \n \n \"After the feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, 'Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.' 'Why were you searching for me?' he asked. 'Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?' But they did not understand what he was saying to them.\" Luke 2:43-48 \n \n \"When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. To those who sold doves he said, 'Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!' His disciples remembered that it is written: 'Zeal for your house will consume me.'\" John 2:13-17 \n \n Hence, if Jesus is not the Messiah there will be no Messiah. This is based on the testimony of the Hebrew Bible that the Messiah had to come before the destruction of the second temple. We are thankful to God that he did arrive before the temple's destruction, as was predicted. \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n AMEN, COME LORD JESUS.",

What I have posted here is the scriptural evidence of what will happen and the prophecies of who the Messiah would be. And Jesus Christ is that person. Read Isaiah 53 yourself, it was written 900 years before Jesus was born and is a perfect description of who Messiah would be.\n \n The denials I'm hearing here are as lame as if you could say that because obvious child denies jesus is the Savior of Humanity, then Jesus must in fact not be the Savior of Humanity.

   "The following study will be a comparison between the concept of Messiah as outlined in the Hebrew Scriptures and that of the Christian New Testament documents.\n\n \n No, it's a crackpot study by people trying to convince Jews to convert. it clearly ignores the scriptures in the Torah.\n \n \nThis verse points out the inescapable fact that the Messiah is God Almighty appearing in human form.\n\n \n Except that Jewish scriptures clearly state that the Messiah will be of Man, not of God. Furthermore Trinity is heresey in Judaism. Find me a rabbi that thinks otherwise.\n \n \nJeremiah 23:5-6 'The days are coming,' declares the Lord, 'When I will raise up to David a righteous Branch, a king who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land. In His days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which He will be called; The Lord our Righteousness (YHVH Tseidkeynu).'\n \n The Targums concluded that this passage was speaking of Messia\n\n \n You're a bigger fool then i take you for. It is obviously stating as Jewish have stated in the past, that the Messiah will be from the line of David, which is not Christ. Furthermore, Christ came about in 4 BC. The state of Israel came about in 1947. You are wrong, just admit. \n \n Where did you get this filth?\n \n \nMost significantly, Jewish tradition affirms at least five things about the Messiah. He will: be a descendant of King David, gain sovereignty over the land of Israel, gather the Jews there from the four corners of the earth, restore them to full observance of Torah law, and, as a grand finale, bring peace to the whole world\n\n \n None of those occured with Christ. Not a single one. How can you claim you know more about Judaism's beliefs then Jews themselves? \n \n \nThe Jewish belief that the Messiah's reign lies in the future has long distinguished Jews from their Christian neighbors who believe, of course, that the Messiah came two thousand years ago in the person of Jesus. The most basic reason for the Jewish denial of the messianic claims made on Jesus' behalf is that he did not usher in world peace, as Isaiah had prophesied: \"And nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore\" (Isaiah 2:4). In addition, Jesus did not help bring about Jewish political sovereignty for the Jews or protection from their enemies.\n\n \n The world is no closer to peace then it ever has been. How can you claim Jesus is the Jewish Messiah when he fails to meet one of the most basic and crucial aspects of the prophecy?\n \n http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/messiah.html\n \n Let's see what ACTUAL JEWS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS ISSUE INSTEAD OF FOOLS LIKE YOU?\n \n \n1) Jesus did not fulfill the messianic prophecies.\n \n 2) Jesus did not embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah.\n \n 3) Biblical verses \"referring\" to Jesus are mistranslations.\n \n 4) Jewish belief is based on national revelation.\n\n \n \n1. JESUS DID NOT FULFILL THE MESSIANIC PROPHECIES\n \n What is the Messiah supposed to accomplish? The Bible says that he will:\n \n A. Build the Third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28).\n \n B. Gather all Jews back to the Land of Israel (Isaiah 43:5-6).\n \n C. Usher in an era of world peace, and end all hatred, oppression, suffering and disease. As it says: \"Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall man learn war anymore.\" (Isaiah 2:4)\n \n D. Spread universal knowledge of the God of Israel, which will unite humanity as one. As it says: \"God will be King over all the world -- on that day, God will be One and His Name will be One\" (Zechariah 14:9).\n \n If an individual fails to fulfill even one of these conditions, then he cannot be \"The Messiah.\"\n\n \n And Archangel is wrong as usual. \n \n \nB. DESCENDENT OF DAVID\n \n According to Jewish sources, the Messiah will be born of human parents and possess normal physical attributes like other people. He will not be a demi-god, (1) nor will he possess supernatural qualities.\n \n The Messiah must be descended on his father's side from King David (see Genesis 49:10, Isaiah 11:1, Jeremiah 23:5, 33:17; Ezekiel 34:23-24). According to the Christian claim that Jesus was the product of a virgin birth, he had no father -- and thus could not have possibly fulfilled the messianic requirement of being descended on his father's side from King David. (2) \n\n \n Guess what arch? Actual Jews think you're wrong! Just like everyone else!\n \n http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp\n \n \nhe Jewish Concept of Messiah and\n the Jewish Response to Christian Claims\n \n 1) The word \"Messiah\" is an English rendering of the Hebrew word \"Mashiach\", whose translation is \"Anointed\". It usually refers to a person initiated into G-d's service by being anointed with oil. (Having oil poured on his head. Cf. Exodus 29:7, I Kings 1:39, II Kings 9:3).\n \n 2) There are many Messiahs in the Bible. Since every King and High Priest was anointed with oil, each may be referred to as \"an anointed one\" (a Mashiach or a Messiah). For example: \"G-d forbid that I [David] should stretch out my hand against the L-rd's Messiah [Saul]...\" I Samuel 26:11. Cf. II Samuel 23:1, Isaiah 45:1, Psalms 20:6.\n \n 3) The Hebrew word \"HaMashiach\" (lit. the Messiah) describing a future anointed person to come does not appear anywhere in the Bible. Since the Bible makes no explicit reference to the Messiah, it is unlikely that it could be considered the most important concept in the Bible. Indeed, in Jewish thought, the Messianic idea is not the most crucial. However, in Christian thought, the Messiah is paramount- a difficulty in light of its conspicuous absence from scripture.\n \n 4) Where does the Jewish concept of Messiah come from? One of the central themes of Biblical prophecy is the promise of a future age of perfection characterized by universal peace and recognition of G-d. Isaiah 2:1-4; Zephaniah 3:9; Hosea 2:20-22; Amos 9:13-15; Isaiah 32:15-18, 60:15-18; Micah 4:1-4; Zechariah 8:23, 14:9; Jeremiah 31:33-34.\n \n 5) Many of these prophetic passages speak of a descendant of King David who will rule Israel during the age of perfection. Isaiah 11:1-9; Jeremiah 23:5-6, 30:7-10, 33:14-16; Ezekiel 34:11-31, 37:21-28; Hosea 3:4-5.\n \n 6) Since every King is a Messiah, by convention, we refer to this future anointed one as The Messiah. The above is the only description in the Bible of a Davidic descendant who is to come in the future. We will recognize the Messiah by seeing who the King of Israel is at the time of complete universal perfection.\n \n 7) The Bible never speaks about believing in the Messiah. Because his reign will be an historically verifiable reality, self-evident to any person, it won't require belief or faith.\n \n 8) Because no person has ever fulfilled the picture painted in the Bible of this future King, Jewish people still await the coming of the Messiah. All past Messianic claimants, including Jesus of Nazareth, Bar Cochba and Shabbtai Tzvi have been rejected.\n \n 9) The claim that Jesus will fulfill the Messianic prophesies when he returns does not give him any credibility for his \"first\" coming. The Bible never speaks about the Messiah returning after an initial appearance. The \"second coming\" theory is a desperate attempt to explain away Jesus' failure. The Biblical passages which Christians are forced to regard as second coming (#5 above) don't speak of someone returning, they have a \"first coming\" perspective.\n \n 10) According to Biblical tradition, Elijah the prophet will reappear before the coming of the Messiah (Malachi 4:5-6). In the Greek Testament, Jesus claims that John the Baptist was Elijah (Matthew 11:13-14, 17:10-13). However, when John the Baptist was asked if he was Elijah, he denied it (John 1:21). The Gospel of Luke 1:17 tries to get around this problem by claiming that John the Baptist came in the spirit of Elijah. However:\n \n a] Malachi predicted that Elijah himself would return, and not just someone coming in his spirit.\n \n b] When asked about his identity, John the Baptist didn't claim to have come in the spirit of Elijah - he claimed no association with Elijah at all.\n \n c] The prophesy about the return of Elijah says that he would restore the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. There is no evidence that John the Baptist accomplished this.\n \n 11) According to the Jewish Bible, the Messiah must be a descendent of King David. (Jeremiah 23:5, 33:17; Ezekiel 34:23-24) Although the Greek Testament traces the genealogy of Joseph (husband of Mary) back to David, it then claims that Jesus resulted from a virgin birth, and, that Joseph was not his father. (Mat. 1:18-23) In response, it is claimed that Joseph adopted Jesus, and passed on his genealogy via adoption. \n \n There are two problems with this claim: \n \n a) there is no Biblical basis for the idea of a father passing on his tribal line by adoption. A priest who adopts a son from another tribe cannot make him a priest by adoption;\n \n b) Joseph could never pass on by adoption that which he doesn't have. Because Joseph descended from Jeconiah (Mat. 1:11) he fell under the curse of that king that none of his descendants could ever sit as king upon the throne of David. (Jeremiah 22:30; 36:30). \n \n To answer this difficult problem, apologists claim that Jesus traces himself back to King David through his mother Mary, who allegedly descends from David, as shown in the third chapter of Luke. There are four basic problems with this claim:\n \n a] There is no evidence that Mary descends from David. The third chapter of Luke traces Joseph's genealogy, not Mary's.\n \n b] Even if Mary can trace herself back to David, that doesn't help Jesus, since tribal affiliation goes only through the father, not mother. Cf. Num. 1:18; Ezra 2:59.\n \n c] Even if family line could go through the mother, Mary was not from a legitimate Messianic family. According to the Bible, the Messiah must be a descendent of David through his son Solomon (II Sam. 7:14;\n \n I Chron. 17:11-14, 22:9-10, 28:4-6) The third chapter of Luke is useless because it goes through David's son Nathan, not Solomon. (Luke 3:31)\n \n d] Luke 3:27 lists Shealtiel and Zerubbabel in his genealogy. These two also appear in Matthew 1:12 as descendants of the cursed Jeconiah. If Mary descends from them, it would also disqualify her from being a Messianic progenitor.\n\n \n http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/faq/general-messiah-jewishresponse.html\n \n How you expect to win this one (as you've lost everything else here) when you directly contridict the beliefs of the people who actually follow the religion with your massive arrogance is really astounding.",

   "No HIM, I'm not saying that Israel as a whole accepts Jesus as the Messiah.\n\n \n That makes no sense. Israel is run as a Jewish Theocracy on its stated religious beliefs as well as many customs. Nowhere in Jewish religious law does it say that The Messiah is Christ. Furthermore many Ultra Conservative Jews reject Israel as it is a creation of the Kingdom of Israel without the work of the Messiah. Furthermore Israel does not represent world Jewry as stated by many letters by groups in the US aganist the actions of Israel in the later part of the 20th century.

   "It's obvious that you just have no spiritual eyes to discern the truth oc.\n\n \n Is that what you call following the stated beliefs of a religion? The Jews have a clear cut checklist for deciding whether or not someone is the Messiah. As Jesus Christ has failed to meet these requirements he cannot be the Jewish Messiah. Your inability to prove that he has fulfilled even a single prophecy is a sign of your weakness. Furthermore, Jewish belief directly holds Trinity to be Heresey.

If you're so right, where's the confidence in your stance ? That's why I'm not exercised by your adamant insistence that because mainstream Israel denies Jesus is the Christ, that He must not be the Christ. Because the whole reason He came to the Gentile is because the chosen people denied and rejected Him, fulfilling the passage that say's, \"The stone which the builders rejected, became the cornerstone of our faith.\" I gave you that verse 2 days ago and it went right over your head apparently.

   "Why waste my time continuously repeating myself as you shout how right you are in spite of the info to the contrary.\nYou are correct about wasting your time by repeating yourself. The problem is that your \"evidence to the contrary\" has been refuted and you are left with nothing more than repetition.\n \nTo you this is about winning a debate online. I'm trying to explain the intricacies of the Word of God and His plan for Humanities Salvation.\nWhich word of god and how do you know? You haven't presented anything more than assertions that your view is correct to this point.\n \nIt isn't so easily discerned and defined as you would lead us to believe.\nSo you are saying that no one can understand your position (the truth) because it is beyond our ability to understand?\n \nThat is the undeniable proof that you have no idea what you are talking about. None what so ever.\nBut you have presented no proof whatsoever. You, a christian, presume to instruct Jews on what they believe. What hubris. \n \n \nAnd neither do those Jews who deny that Christ is the promised Messiah who DID come through the line of David. And He did fulfill every Prophecy referring to the Messiah, no matter how violently you deny it.\nYeah. Right. Considering that the Gospels were written some 50 to 100 years after your Messiah was alleged to have lived, why should we wonder that they claim to fulfill prophesy?\n \nBut what are you getting so excited about ? If you're so right, where's the confidence in your stance ?\nFirst of all, why the annoying spaces before question marks? I know that I am being a bit of a pedant, but the fact is that semi-literate English does not reflect well on your ability to present arguments. At best, it distracts from your point.\n \n Nevertheless, I don't see that anyone but you is getting excited. Certainly, OC has expressed considerable confidence in his stance. Why pretend otherwise?\n \nThat's why I'm not exercised by your adamant insistence that because mainstream Israel denies Jesus is the Christ, that He must not be the Christ.\nSo you didn't understand the discussion? How sad. And note is taken that you have pulled a bait and switch - what was denied was that Jews deny that Jesus is the Messiah. \"Christ\" is, of course, derived from a Greek word that has no meaning to Jews. \"Israel\" is not a synonym for Jews.\n \nBecause [snip] nonsense that contradicts the point that Jesus is the Messiah of the Jews by claiming that the Jews rejected him as the Messiah.[/snip] Get it ?\nI do. You are confused.\n \nI am confidently telling you that Israel is still the chosen people who will receive Christ before the end of this Age. Consider yourself blessed because you live in a time when you will see the culmination of human history if you live a normal life-span. Count on it.\nBWAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n \nNow you can rage and attack me all you like, but you'll still be as wrong as you can be regarding what the bible actually say's [sic] and how it's actually interpreted.\nAnd you know what the Bible actually says?\n \nBut have at it. It isn't me your offending, it's the author of the truths you are raping so recklessly.\nWhat author might that be? And why are you so offended if you are not the author?",

You're not worth arguing against. At this point you're just worth mocking.\n \n \nTo you this is about winning a debate online.\n\n \n Well duh. Take the facts and prove your argument. Your statement would imply that you're not interested in winning the debate, which actually makes alot of sense as you haven't used any facts nor do you seem interested in responding to rebuttles. \n \n \nI'm trying to explain the intricacies of the Word of God and His plan for Humanities Salvation.\n\n \n I have more use for the carcasses of dead vultures then I do for your dogma. Save it for someone who cares and doesn't have a brain. \n \n \nAnd He did fulfill every Prophecy referring to the Messiah, no matter how violently you deny it.\n\n \n Except I listed the propechies and Christ didn't fufill them. Israel came 2 milleinia after Christ. The temple is still not rebuilt. War is still around us. There are hundreds of varying religions. I can go on and on about how Christ failed to fufill even 1/4 of the Prophecies and I can cite again Jewish sources that state why they do not accept Jesus as the Messiah but you in fantasy land simply do not care about facts much less what Jews actually believe and what the prophecies state. Hence why you ignore what the Jews actually say. You haven't shown you understand the first thing about Judaism. How can you correct them on something you do not understand? \n \n \nBut what are you getting so excited about ? If you're so right, where's the confidence in your stance?\n\n \n The only thing that excites me is that you are evidence the US public education system is a failure, has been a failure and needs reform. Not that I need more evidence....I have not lost a single ounce of confidence in my stance yet. May I remind you that you claimed Lucifier had free will yet did not at the same time? There's at least now 20 posts you are deliberately ignoring now. For somoene who is so confident you seem to be rather...cowardly. Not to mention you're refusing to address my points. That's usually a sign of that you have no argument and you know it. \n \n \n\"The stone which the builders rejected, became the cornerstone of our faith.\"\n\n \n That could mean anything in any context. Didn't you learn cherry picking and context removal was a no-no in bible college?\n \n \nI gave you that verse 2 days ago and it went right over your head apparently. You see, Jesus is the stone, the Jews are the builders, and He then became the cornerstone of the Gentiles faith. Get it ?\n\n \n No, that's your interpretation. That doesn't mean it is true (GASP!). Futhermore, we are all using the assumption that Christ even existed much less that either Judaism or Christanity are true. Remove that and we're arguing about something quite foolish. \n \n \nI am confidently telling you that Israel is still the chosen people who will receive Christ before the end of this Age.\n\n \n So apparently Christians, Muslims and all sorts of religions are now God's chosen people?\n \n You're not very educated about the state of Israel are you? Oh wait, that's like saying the Pope lives in Rome. There are over a million voting Palestinan muslims in Israel. I suppose arguing from a position of absolute ignorance does have its advantages. You never need to think or learn anything. Just wash, rinse, repeat. \n \n pandion, I wonder if he realizes that numerous North American Jewish societies have issued rather nasty letters stating that Israel does not, has not and will not represent world Jewry?",

   "Isaiah 53 is talkign abuot the nation of Israel, not a messiah. Read it in context. The writer of the third part of Isaiah keeps on refering to Israel as\n the servant.\n \n To try to imply that Isaiah 53 is refering to Jesus is strong mistake.\n\n \n You have got to be kidding me. Talk about self delusions. In all of God's dealings with Israel and the children of Abraham, He has never once accused them of being sinless or pure. But you wont believe me so here's a far better source to consider. http://www.chaim.org/nation.htm\n \n Why Isaiah 53 cannot refer to the nation of Israel, or anyone else, but must be the Messiah \n \n 1. The servant of Isaiah 53 is an innocent and guiltless sufferer. Israel is never described as sinless. Isaiah 1:4 says of the nation: \"Alas sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity. A brood of evildoers, children who are corrupters!\" He then goes on in the same chapter to characterize Judah as Sodom, Jerusalem as a harlot, and the people as those whose hands are stained with blood (verses 10, 15, and 21). What a far cry from the innocent and guiltless sufferer of Isaiah 53 who had \"done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth!\"\n \n \n 2. The prophet said: \"It pleased the LORD to bruise him.\" Has the awful treatment of the Jewish people (so contrary, by the way, to the teaching of Jesus to love everyone) really been God's pleasure, as is said of the suffering of the servant in Isaiah 53:10 ? If, as some rabbis contend, Isaiah 53 refers to the holocaust, can we really say of Israel's suffering during that horrible period, \"It pleased the LORD to bruise him?\" Yet it makes perfect sense to say that God was pleased to have Messiah suffer and die as our sin offering to provide us forgiveness and atonement.\n \n 3. The person mentioned in this passage suffers silently and willingly. Yet all people, even Israelites, complain when they suffer! Brave Jewish men and women fought in resistance movements against Hitler. Remember the Vilna Ghetto Uprising? Remember the Jewish men who fought on the side of the allies? Can we really say Jewish suffering during the holocaust and during the preceding centuries was done silently and willingly?\n \n 4. The figure described in Isaiah 53 suffers, dies, and rises again to atone for his people's sins. The Hebrew word used in Isaiah 53:10 for \"sin-offering\" is \"asham,\" which is a technical term meaning \"sin-offering.\" See how it is used in Leviticus chapters 5 and 6. Isaiah 53 describes a sinless and perfect sacrificial lamb who takes upon himself the sins of others so that they might be forgiven. Can anyone really claim that the terrible suffering of the Jewish people, however undeserved and unjust, atones for the sins of the world? Whoever Isaiah 53 speaks of, the figure described suffers and dies in order to provide a legal payment for sin so that others can be forgiven. This cannot be true of the Jewish people as a whole, or of any other mere human.\n \n 5. It is the prophet who is speaking in this passage. He says: \"who has believed our message.\" The term \"message\" usually refers to the prophetic message, as it does in Jeremiah 49:14. Also, when we understand the Hebrew parallelism of verse 1, we see \"Who has believed our message\" as parallel to \"to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed.\" The \"arm of the Lord\" refers to God's powerful act of salvation. So the message of the speaker is the message of a prophet declaring what God has done to save his people. \n \n 6. The prophet speaking is Isaiah himself, who says the sufferer was punished for \"the transgression of my people,\" according to verse 8. Who are the people of Isaiah? Israel. So the sufferer of Isaiah 53 suffered for Israel. So how could he be Israel?\n \n 7. The figure of Isaiah 53 dies and is buried according to verses 8 and 9. The people of Israel have never died as a whole. They have been out of the land on two occasions and have returned, but they have never ceased to be among the living. Yet Jesus died, was buried, and rose again.\n \n 8. If Isaiah 53 cannot refer to Israel, how about Isaiah himself? But Isaiah said he was a sinful man of unclean lips (Isaiah 6:5-7). And Isaiah did not die as an atonement for our sins. Could it have been Jeremiah? Jeremiah 11:19 does echo the words of Isaiah 53. Judah rejected and despised the prophet for telling them the truth. Leaders of Judah sought to kill Jeremiah, and so the prophet describes himself in these terms. But they were not able to kill the prophet. Certainly Jeremiah did not die to atone for the sins of his people. What of Moses? Could the prophet have been speaking of him? But Moses wasn't sinless either. Moses sinned and was forbidden from entering the promised land (Numbers 20:12). Moses indeed attempted to offer himself as a sacrifice in place of the nation, but God did not allow him to do so (Exodus 32:30-35). Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah were all prophets who gave us a glimpse of what Messiah, the ultimate prophet, would be like, but none of them quite fit Isaiah 53.\n \n So what can we conclude? Isaiah 53 cannot refer to the nation of Israel, nor to Isaiah, nor to Moses, nor another prophet. And if not to Moses, certainly not to any lesser man. Yet Messiah would be greater than Moses. As the rabbinic writing \"Yalkut\" said: \"Who art thou, O great mountain? (Zech. iv.7) This refers to the King Messiah. And why does he call him`the great mountain?' because he is greater than the patriarchs, as it is said, `My servant shall be high, and lifted up, and lofty exceedingly' --he will be higher than Abraham...lifted up above Moses...loftier then the ministering angels...\" (Quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, page 9.)\n \n Of whom does Isaiah speak? He speaks of the Messiah, as many ancient rabbis concluded. The second verse of Isaiah 53 makes it crystal clear. The figure grows up as \"a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground.\" The shoot springing up is beyond reasonable doubt a reference to the Messiah, and, in fact, it is a common Messianic reference in Isaiah and elsewhere. The Davidic dynasty was to be cut down in judgement like a felled tree, but it was promised to Israel that a new sprout would shoot up from the stump. The Messiah was to be that sprout. Several Hebrew words were used to refer to this undeniably Messianic image. All the terms are related in meaning and connected in the Messianic texts where they were used. Isaiah 11, which virtually all rabbis agreed refers to the Messiah, used the words \"shoot\" (hoter) and branch (netser) to describe the Messianic King. Isaiah 11:10 called Messiah the \"Root (shoresh) of Jesse,\" Jesse being David's father. Isaiah 53 described the suffering servant as a root (shoresh) from dry ground, using the very same metaphor and the very same word as Isaiah 11. We also see other terms used for the same concept, such as branch (tsemach) in Jeremiah 23:5, in Isaiah 4:2 and also in the startling prophecies of Zechariah 3:8 and 6:12.\n \n Beyond doubt, Isaiah 52:13-53:12 refers to Messiah Jesus. He is the one highly exalted before whom kings shut their mouths. Messiah is the shoot who sprung up from the fallen Davidic dynasty. He became the King of Kings. He provided the ultimate atonement. \n \n Isaiah 52:13 states that it would be the Messiah who will \"sprinkle\" many nations. What does that mean? What was Messiah's ministry to be toward the nations? The word translated \"sprinkle\" or sometimes \"startle\" is found several other places in the OT. The Hebrew word is found in Leviticus 4:6; 8:11; 14:7, and Numbers 8:7, 19:18-19. The references cited all pertain to priestly sprinklings of the blood of atonement, the anointing oil of consecration, and the ceremonial water used to cleanse the unclean. Is Isaiah 52:13 telling us that the Messiah will act as a priest who applies atonement, anoints to consecrate, sprinkles to make clean? (This vision of the Messiah as both priest and king is also found in Zechariah 6:12-13). But, priests were to come from the tribe of Levi and Kings from the tribe of Judah! What kind of priest is he? David told us Messiah would be a priest of the order of Melchizedek (see Psalm 110 and Hebrews chapters 7-9). \n \n Isaiah 53 must be understood as referring to the coming Davidic King, the Messiah. King Messiah was prophesied to suffer and die to pay for our sins and then rise again. He would serve as a priest to the nations of the world and apply the blood of atonement to cleanse those who believe. There is one alone who this can refer to, Jesus, whom millions refer to as Christ, which is from the Greek word for Messiah. Those who confess him are his children, his promised offspring, the spoils of his victory. According to the testimony of the Jewish Apostles, Jesus died for our sins, rose again, ascended to the right hand of God, and he now serves as our great High Priest who cleanses us of sin and our King. Jesus rules over his people and is in the process of conquering the Gentiles. The first century Jewish disciples were willing to die rather than deny they had seen the risen Messiah. Only if one has presupposed Jesus cannot have been the Messiah can one deny that which is obvious. Israel's greatest son, Jesus, is the one Isaiah foresaw.\n \n ",

How do you respond to these Rabbi's ?\n \n What Did the Rabbis Say?\n \n Maybe you weren't told, but many ancient rabbinic sources understood Isaiah 53 as referring to the Messiah. Here are quotations from some of them.\n \n Babylonian Talmud: \"The Messiah - what is his name?...The Rabbis say, The Leper Scholar, as it is said, 'surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him a leper, smitten of God and afflicted...'\" (Sanhedrin 98b)\n \n Midrash Ruth Rabbah: \"Another explanation (of Ruth ii.14): - He is speaking of king Messiah; 'Come hither,' draw near to the throne; 'and eat of the bread,' that is, the bread of the kingdom; 'and dip thy morsel in the vinegar,' this refers to his chastisements, as it is said, 'But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities'\"\n \n Targum Jonathan: \"Behold my servant Messiah shall prosper; he shall be high and increase and be exceedingly strong...\"\n \n Zohar: \"'He was wounded for our transgressions,' etc....There is in the Garden of Eden a palace called the Palace of the Sons of Sickness; this palace the Messiah then enters, and summons every sickness, every pain, and every chastisement of Israel; they all come and rest upon him. And were it not that he had thus lightened them off Israel and taken them upon himself, there had been no man able to bear Israel's chastisements for the transgression of the law: and this is that which is written, 'Surely our sicknesses he hath carried.'\"\n \n Rabbi Moses Maimonides: \"What is the manner of Messiah's advent....there shall rise up one of whom none have known before, and signs and wonders which they shall see performed by him will be the proofs of his true origin; for the Almighty, where he declares to us his mind upon this matter, says, 'Behold a man whose name is the Branch, and he shall branch forth out of his place' (Zech. 6:12). And Isaiah speaks similarly of the time when he shall appear, without father or mother or family being known, He came up as a sucker before him, and as a root out of dry earth, etc....in the words of Isaiah, when describing the manner in which kings will harken to him, At him kings will shut their mouth; for that which had not been told them have they seen, and that which they had not heard they have perceived.\" (From the Letter to the South (Yemen), quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, pages 374-5)\n \n Rabbi Mosheh Kohen Ibn Crispin: This rabbi described those who interpret Isaiah 53 as referring to Israel as those: \"having forsaken the knowledge of our Teachers, and inclined after the 'stubbornness of their own hearts,' and of their own opinion, I am pleased to interpret it, in accordance with the teaching of our Rabbis, of the King Messiah....This prophecy was delivered by Isaiah at the divine command for the purpose of making known to us something about the nature of the future Messiah, who is to come and deliver Israel, and his life from the day when he arrives at discretion until his advent as a redeemer, in order that if anyone should arise claiming to be himself the Messiah, we may reflect, and look to see whether we can observe in him any resemblance to the traits described here; if there is any such resemblance, then we may believe that he is the Messiah our righteousness; but if not, we cannot do so.\" (From his commentary on Isaiah, quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, pages 99-114.)",

In other words, from this same single celled organism all life on Earth, whether it be a Tree, Flower, Insect, Bird, Fish, Amphibian or Mammal, we all came from this common ancestry according to evolution.\n \n With that said, it stands to reason that way back in the beginning of our evolutionary lineage, as before the tree trunk of let's say fish broke off into branches of amphibians like worms, salamanders, frogs and toads; which then evolved into snakes, varmints such as squirrels, rodents, muskrats and other mammals, and then to larger mammals and into birds. \n \n The point is that all life came from a single celled organism according to evolution, or at least according to abiogenesis which evo is the next stage of. So you must believe that originally man, human beings were a lower life form of a different species completely and eventually evolved into upright walking primates only after many evolutionary changes.\n \n You can't have it both ways my friend. Either we evolved from the lower life forms thereby uniting us with all of them as siblings in the animal kingdom or man is uniquely superior as I claim we are. Which is it ? Are you ready to apologize and admit that I am right ?\n \n Here we can see that abiogenesis defines out to mean life from non living matter.\n http://www.answers.com/topic/abiogenesis\n \n And here is the definition of evo and read the last sentence before telling me my post is inaccurate and I don't understand evolution or what it claims.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution",

   "Simply put john, and I'm shocked that people who claim to be intelligent can't see it, but I'll explain it to you because I'm the epitome of patience.\n\n ... but not apparently of attention. Nothing in what follows addresses my request to explain the nonsense you posted from Ray Comfort.\n \n But never mind. You have since posted such muddled nonsense of your own that Mr. Comfort is left standing. Others have tried to explain some of your confusion to you, so I'll keep my comments brief.\n \nWith that said, it stands to reason that way back in the beginning of our evolutionary lineage, as before the tree trunk of let's say fish broke off into branches of amphibians like worms, salamanders, frogs and toads; which then evolved into snakes, varmints such as squirrels, rodents, muskrats and other mammals, and then to larger mammals and into birds.\n\n The phrase 'amphibians like worms' probably tells us all we need to know about your biological understanding, but we'll politely set it aside. (Actually, many amphibians do like worms. Toads love them.)\n \nSo you must believe that originally man, human beings were a lower life form of a different species completely and eventually evolved into upright walking primates only after many evolutionary changes.\n\n I find your way of thinking odd here. How could 'human beings [be] a lower life form of a different species completely'? If they were a different species, they weren't human beings. What you mean, I assume, is that humans have non-human ancestors. Well of course we do.\n \nYou can't have it both ways my friend. Either we evolved from the lower life forms thereby uniting us with all of them as siblings in the animal kingdom or man is uniquely superior as I claim we are. Which is it ?\n\n Who on earth is trying to have it both ways? Apart from the word siblings, and some qualification of the word 'lower', your first option is correct.\n \nAre you ready to apologize and admit that I am right ?\n\n Why would I even contemplate such a thing?

And also to show that evolutionists will hide, and even bury evidence that contradicts their long held preconceived notions rather than face undeniable conflicts in the fossil record. So either I am showing you human, modern fossils that lived 12 million years ago and even farther back, which goes against every accepted fact in evo or we can't trust the ages and dates that we place on the depths any of the fossil record that the alleged science of evolution asks us to accept as Gospel Facts. PUN DEFINITELY INTENDED. This is solid evidence that is ignored and even hidden by the main stream evolution science community because it conflicts with the desired outcome they work so hard not to discover, but to create. So please explain these valid recorded conflicts in your precious science if you can. \n \n PS. scroll to the bottom of the page and explain that one if you can.\n \n http://www.pureinsight.org/pi/index.php?news=961\n \n Accepted theories and unaccepted facts \n \n In most of the academic and scientific world today, the interpretation of the history of the earth, of life, of man, and of human culture, is defined within the narrow boundaries of specific, prevailing theories. The geology of the earth, for example, is viewed almost exclusively in terms of uniformitarianism. This means that the present-existing processes of erosion and volcanism are thought to have been the only forces at work in the past. Because of the slowness of these processes of change, and the tremendous transformations observed in the earth's depths, the age of the earth is thus counted in billions of years - today, it is put between 4 1/2 and 5 billion years.\n \n Likewise, the history of life on this planet is seen as a lengthy development by evolution, or, the progression from simple to increasingly more complex forms. Since the simplest - and supposedly earliest - life forms appear in Cambrian rock, and Cambrian rock is dated geologically at 600 million years, this is deemed the age of life on earth. Only in the final stage of evolution did man appear on the scene, the ultimate end-product: According to the most recent anthropological finds, the earliest man-like creatures roamed the earth just 4 million years ago. Finally, the very nature of evolutionary theory dictates that man's cultural development must have been linear - a slow, gradual, but constant, upward climb from primitive beginnings, spanning the last 10,000 years, with the advent of modern technological civilization and its products the recent culmination of that climb.\n \n These theories, which together form the uniformitarian-evolution-linear model, have predominated modern science for the past century, to the extent that all finds made - every rock sample, every fossil, every human remains and every artifact - have been carefully interpreted and categorized so as to fit this model's framework, at the exclusion of all other. But it is becoming increasingly apparent that not all facts from the past find their 'proper' place. Other discoveries have been made that contradict the accepted model. Yet these discoveries are largely ignored, since it is far easier for the majority of scientists and historians to uphold what is 'established,' than to try to build a new model based on the 'exceptions.'\n \n One of the greatest pitfalls of the uniformitarian-evolution-linear model is that it must accept the premise that man, as an intelligent being, was a very recent arrival in the history of the earth. With the geologic record counted in billions of years, the fossil record in hundreds of millions of years, the record of human fossils in the millions of years, and human civilization only in the thousands of years, there would be no way to explain the presence of human bones, or sophisticated artifacts derived from the hand of man, in deep rock strata. In fact, the finding of even a single such item would be totally devastating to the model, for it would negate the entire concept of uniformity, and the evolution of man and human culture in the past.\n \n The point that will be brought out in this book is that there is evidence for man, and the products of human civilization, in the deep recesses of the earth. Herein are presented the case histories.\n \n (2) The bones of forgotten men\n \n Walk into any natural museum today, or read any textbook on anthropology, and one invariably finds a large chart exhibited, tracing the ancestry of man back through more primitive forebears, until the line is lost somewhere amid the apes. Recently, paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey, excavating in Ethiopia, announced the discovery of what are supposed to be the oldest accepted fossil remains of man - about 4 million years old. What has been disturbing about the new finds is that they are, in part, too human: Their great age, yet partly 'modern' appearance, has forced evolutionists to push back the departure of man from the ape stock farther into the past, so that now it is beginning to infringe upon the time period necessary for the development of the apes themselves.\n \n But while the African finds are revolutionary, there have been other discoveries of human fossils greatly more important, but these have been deliberately neglected or denounced, because they are far older than man is 'supposed' to be.\n \n Over a hundred years ago, in the 1850's, gold miners began digging tunnels into the sides and top of Table Mountain, northwest of Needles, California. Gold was discovered, but along with it were bones of extinct mastodons, mammoths, bison, tapirs, horses, rhinos, hippos and camels - all dating from the Pliocene. In 1863, a physician from nearby Sonora, Dr. R. Snell, began to collect specimens from the excavations. In that year, with his bare hands, he loosened from among the fossils a stone disc that appeared to have been used for grinding. But Dr. Snell was not the first, or last, to unearth mysterious objects from the mountain gravel: In 1853, Oliver W. Stevens made affidavit that he removed a large stone bowl from the lowest level tunnel; in 1857, the Honorable Paul Hubbs, of Vallejo, dug up part of a human crania from inside the Valentine shaft; and in 1862, Mr. Llewellyn Pierce also signed affidavit that he had found a stone mortar 200 feet in from the mouth of the same shaft. The most dramatic find, however, was reserved for a Mr. Mattison, one of the owners of the mines. In February of 1866, Mattison unearthed from beneath a layer of basalt an object which - because of the encrustation's - he first thought was the petrified root of a tree, but on closer examination discovered was a complete human skull. The miner sent the skull to the office of the State Survey in June of the same year. Eventually, the skull came into the possession of Dr. L. Wyman, of Harvard College, who removed the encasing material around the cranium. Dr. Wyman, and an associate named Professor Whitney, identified the skull as very modern in type, but also noted that, 'the fragments of bones and gravel and shells were so wedged into the cavities of the skull that there could be no mistake as to the character of the situation in which it is found.' The stickler was, however, that this meant the skull, along with all the artifacts found, were 12 million years old.\n \n In 1958, Dr. Johannes Huerzeler, of the Museum of Natural History in Basel, Switzerland, unearthed a human jawbone at a depth of 600 feet, in a coal mine in Tuscany, Italy. The bone had belonged to a child, between the ages of five and seven. Though flattened like a sheet of iron, the jaw was declared by several experts to be not only human, but modern-looking at that. But what mystified them was that it had been encased in a Miocene stratum - geologically dated at 20 million years. Dr. Huerzeler declared it to be the world's oldest man' - but his fellow anthropologists did not dare give it the same distinction. Here were human remains more modern in appearance than all the 'ape-men' forms ever found - yet they were five times as old as any of them. In fact, the jaw bone is as old, if not older, than many ancestors of the apes. The bone raised more problems than answers - so the find was quickly 'shelved,' and no further work was ever done to give it due recognition.\n \n Early in November of 1926, archaeologist J.C.F. Siegfriedt made a discovery in another mine, this one the Number Three shaft of the Mutual Coal Mine of Bear Creek, 55 miles southwest of Billings, Montana. What Siegfriedt found was a human tooth, in which the enamel had been replaced by carbon and the roots by iron, by seepage petrification. In an account published in the Carbon County News and dated November 11, 1926, Siegfriedt reported that he had meticulously preserved the mineral matrix that had been deposited around the tooth, and several dentists identified the mold created as being a human second lower molar. The tooth, however, came from the lower level of the mine - from an Eocene deposit dated at 30 million years old. Siegfriedt could generate no interest in his find among other specialists, and as far as is known, no one has done any further study of the mystery.\n \n One of the more controversial of the 'out-of-place' bones from extreme antiquity is today part of the collection of the Freiberg Mining Academy in West Germany. It is a poorly preserved human skull, found in brown coal in 1842, from an undisclosed locality. Early European authorities dismissed the skull as a fake, but more recent research and analysis has questioned this hasty pronouncement, putting it back into the realm of the authentic. The reason for its initial denunciation is understandable: The coal it was embedded in, a portion of which still clings to the skull, is estimated to be as much as 50 million years old.\n \n It seems that even when authentication is overwhelming, the response by the scientific community is, inversely, underwhelming. In 1973, a rock collector named Lin Ottinger was searching over a rock plateau that had just been bulldozed over, in preparation for the beginning of mining operations by the nearby Big Indian Copper Mine. The mine is situated 35 miles southwest of Moab, Utah. During his pickings in the exposed rock, Ottinger suddenly found pieces of bone and teeth, and traced these to a patch of sand with a brown stain - the tell-tale sign of decayed organic matter. Carefully removing the sand, Ottinger discovered the top portion of a large intact bone. The rockhound, realizing the importance of his find, decided to have a credited expert look at it, and let him do the digging, so that everything would be 'scientifically acceptable.'\n \n A week later, Ottinger returned to the plateau with Dr. J.P. Marwitt, professor of anthropology at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, several photographers, a news reporter, and a number of observers. With cameras recording the event, Dr. Marwitt carefully removed the lower halves of two human skeletons. The bones were articulated - that is, laid out naturally - showing the bodies had not fallen or been washed into the stratum in which they were situated. These and other factors revealed the bones to be as old as the layer in which they were found. The one problem was, the layer is Lower Dakota and Upper Morrison formations -over 100 million years of age, according to uniformitarian geologists. Yet, as Marwitt noted, the bones were not simian or even half-ape: They were fully human and modern-looking.\n \n (3) The bones of forgotten men\n \n The skeletons were taken by Marwitt back with him to the University of Utah, to run laboratory datings on them. But whether the tests were ever run, there was no official confirmation. One gets the impression they were, and that the findings were too disturbing for conservative thinking. Marwitt suddenly became 'disinterested' in the project, and left Utah to take up a teaching position elsewhere. After a year waiting for results, Ottinger recovered the bones - and that ended the scientific inquiry.\n \n More finds, made in the last century, were similarly reported, and promptly forgotten. The Saturday Herald of Iowa City carried an article that on April 10, 1867, human remains and artifacts were brought to light at the Rocky Point Mine, in Gilman, Colorado. At a depth of 400 feet below the surface, excavators found human bones embedded in a silver vein. Along with the bones was found a well-tempered copper arrowhead. As best as can be calculated, the vein in which the items were situated was 135 million years old, by present geological standards. ((SR. #2))\n \n At times, the discoveries made revealed 'mysteries upon mysteries.' In July, 1877, four prospectors were looking for gold and silver outcroppings in a desolate, hilly area near the head of Spring Valley, not far from Eureka, Nevada. Scanning the rocks, one of the men spotted something peculiar projecting from a high ledge. Climbing up to get a better look, the prospector was surprised to find a human legbone and knee cap sticking out of solid rock. He called to his companions, and together they dislodged the oddity with picks. Realizing they had a most unusual find, the men brought it into Eureka, where it was placed on display.\n \n The stone in which the bones were embedded was a hard, dark red quartzite, and the bones themselves were almost black with carbonization - indicative of great age. When the surrounding stone was carefully chipped away, the specimen was found to be composed of a leg bone broken off four inches above the knee, the knee cap and joint, the lower leg bones, and the complete bones of the foot. Several medical doctors examined the remains, and were convinced that anatomically they had indeed once belonged to a human being, and a very modern-looking one. But an intriguing aspect of the bones was their size: from knee to heel they measured 39 inches. Their owner in life had thus stood over 12 feet tall. Compounding the mystery further was the fact that the rock in which the bones were found was dated geologically to he era of the dinosaurs, the Jurassic - over 185 million years old. The local papers ran several stories on the marvelous find, and two museums sent investigators to see if any more of the skeleton could be located. Unfortunately, nothing else but the leg and foot existed in the rock.\n \n The next and last skeletal find takes us another quantum leap in geologic time, and plunges us even deeper into the earth's strata. A Scientific American article published in 1880 reprinted the particulars of a discovery made in the spring of that year, reported in the St. Louis Republican. Dr. R.W. Booth, who operated an iron mine about 3 miles from Dry Branch, in Franklin County, Missouri, unearthed from a depth of 18 feet a human skull, portions of ribs, vertebrae and a collar bone. With them were two barbed arrowheads of flint, and pieces of charcoal. Dr. Booth realized the significance of all this, but was frustrated when at just a touch the skull crumbled to dust, and the other bones likewise broke into pieces. But these pieces nevertheless told their story: Later analysis showed they were definitely human. Two and a half weeks later, Dr. Booth reached a level of 24 feet, and found more of the same skeleton - a thigh bone, vertebrae, and more charred wood. What is more, the remains were found resting on a layer of iron ore, which bore the impressions of coarse matting. One could still see the marks of criss-crossing fibers. What astounded Booth was that the layer in which both portions were dug up was the second or saccharoidal sandstone of the Lower Silurian - dated an incredible 425 million years old.\n \n Let me repeat that: 425 million years. We have gone far beyond the purported age of human culture, of man himself, the apes, all mammals, even the age of the dinosaurs. According to evolutionary theory, the Silurian age saw the advent of life on land and was in fact more than two-thirds of the way back to the supposed advent of life itself. But what are the remains of man and his products doing at this level? Something, certainly, is very wrong.",

   "Being a palaeontologist I feel this is an appropriate time for me to step into the mix.... \n \n \nto show you the inconsistency of the fossil record\n\n \n Give the man a medal. Those of us who study the fossil record know that it's full of holes (otherwise there'd be no room for the GotG idea) on a regional scale. However, on a global scale, it's actually not as bad as many believe. Fossil deposits can be found that cover almost the whole of the geological timescale.\n \n \nand the assumptions evolutionists make in claiming the age a fossil is depending on the strata it is found in.\n\n \n Which is based on absolute dating carried out on applicable strata. There's some slop, but again on a global scale it's minimal.\n \n \nAnd also to show that evolutionists will hide, and even bury evidence that contradicts their long held preconceived notions rather than face undeniable conflicts in the fossil record.\n\n \n All hail the EAC!!! Oh, damn. I wasn't meant to mention that... Despite not getting my pen (:) electrolyte!)\n \n \nSo either I am showing you human, modern fossils that lived 12 million years ago and even farther back, which goes against every accepted fact in evo or we can't trust the ages and dates that we place on the depths any of the fossil record that the alleged science of evolution asks us to accept as Gospel Facts. PUN DEFINITELY INTENDED.\n\n \n Although you may not accept this, there is no gospel in science. Everything can be questioned. Some things just seem to survive. (I should patent that idea, call it survival of the most resistant or summat....)\n \n \nThis is solid evidence that is ignored and even hidden by the main stream evolution science community because it conflicts with the desired outcome they work so hard not to discover, but to create. \n\n \n See above\n \n \nThe geology of the earth, for example, is viewed almost exclusively in terms of uniformitarianism\n\n \n I know this book avoids current literature like the plague, but damn. Modern geology was revolutionised by Catastrophism (Alvarez and Alvarez 1988 I think?). Anyway uniformitarianism is summed up by the sentence; the present is the key to the past. This merely means that any processes we observe today can be reasonably inferred to the geological past, and not all modern geological processes are slow. Also please avoid coming up with some tripe about geologists believing only in the law of superposition.\n \n \nThis means that the present-existing processes of erosion and volcanism are thought to have been the only forces at work in the past.\n\n \n See above. Also include tectonic activity, faulting, orogenesis and so on\n \n \nBecause of the slowness of these processes of change, and the tremendous transformations observed in the earth's depths, the age of the earth is thus counted in billions of years - today, it is put between 4 1/2 and 5 billion years.\n\n \n Actually the age of the earth is based on the age of rocks. See here and here. The earth must be at least as old as the rocks in it, so the age of the earth is at least 4.3 billion years. (If the age of the earth was based on the quantity of sediment it'd be nowhere near 4 billion years. There's not that much)\n \n \nprogression from simple to increasingly more complex forms.\n\n \n Not true. Actually evolution repeatedly produces less complex forms. See Horse's leg (evolution of), tetrapod skulls (relative to fish skulls), snakes (relative to their ancestors). Although there is a general trend towards complexity at the organismic level, there's no rule that all new species must be more complex than their ancestors. \n \n \nSince the simplest - and supposedly earliest - life forms appear in Cambrian rock, and Cambrian rock is dated geologically at 600 million years, this is deemed the age of life on earth\n\n \n Ever heard of Ediacara?\n \n From Wiki:\n \n \nWell-dated fossils of bacteria are found in cherts 3460 million years and probable bacterial mats known back to 3600 million years. 3800 million year old graphite in metasediments from Western Greenland is thought to be of organic origin\n\n \n \n \nOnly in the final stage of evolution did man appear on the scene, the ultimate end-product\n\n \n Evolution assumes no aim, and is still going on, so how are we the 'end-product'?\n \n \nAccording to the most recent anthropological finds, the earliest man-like creatures roamed the earth just 4 million years ago\n\n \n I assume you're referring to Australopithicenes.\n \n \nFinally, the very nature of evolutionary theory dictates that man's cultural development must have been linear - a slow, gradual, but constant, upward climb from primitive beginnings, spanning the last 10,000 years, with the advent of modern technological civilization and its products the recent culmination of that climb.\n\n \n Evolution makes no statements about culture, human or otherwise. It states how some forms of social interaction can be passed on, but not a word about how cultures will appear or deveolop.\n \n ...categorized so as to fit this model's framework, at the exclusion of all other...\n \n Says the person determined to attack a theory furnished with evidence in the name of his personal beliefs....\n \n \nOne of the greatest pitfalls of the uniformitarian-evolution-linear model is that it must accept the premise that man, as an intelligent being, was a very recent arrival in the history of the earth\n\n \n Well it depends where you draw the line at intelligence, but considering all geological time, you're accurate.\n \n \nTheir great age, yet partly 'modern' appearance, has forced evolutionists to push back the departure of man from the ape stock farther into the past, so that now it is beginning to infringe upon the time period necessary for the development of the apes themselves.\n\n \n So all that says is that we have to push our dates back. Whoops.\n \n \ndeliberately neglected or denounced, because they are far older than man is 'supposed' to be.\n\n \n No matter how much you roll around and scream, you can't make the EAC true. All new introductions into science should be treated with scepticism until they are accepted. What's wrong with that? Some things (like your ancient cases of misidentification) don't survive that process. Their loss.\n \n \nOver a hundred years ago ... [snip]\n\n \n I've heard this sort of thing before. I'd like to know why people like me (palaeontologists) are meant to be suppressing this sort of knowledge (unless it really is that we're nasty nasty people. Anyway, those identifications are very old. The first dinosaur ever discovered was thought to be the bone of a giant (Scrotum humanum real name. I promise!). I'd be more convinced if these examples had been verified. Of course you'll just kick and scream, but I want evidence to be verified, not just said. (After all 43% of statistics are made up on the spot :) )\n \n \nBut what are the remains of man and his products doing at this level?\n\n \n I doubt they were.....\n \n \nSomething, certainly, is very wrong.\n\n \n Yes, but I don't think it's evolutionary theory....\n \n \nSo please explain these valid recorded conflicts in your precious science if you can.\n\n \n Recording something doesn't make it real.
