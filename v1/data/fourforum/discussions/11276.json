I want to spend $1000 or less...any ideas? \n \n I am currently looking at:\n \n Epiphone Masterbuilt EF500-RA\n Breedlove Atlas AD20/SR Plus\n Seagull Artist Mosaic Folk\n Gibson DSR\n \n Anyone know anything about these particular guitars that could help me to decide? I have played them all and find them to be pretty equal in sound. People tell me that the Epi will come in a little better in sounds as it ages. \n \n That or any other suggestions that you think I should consider. I am mostly into fingerpicking, and play a good bit of folk, classic rock, bluegrass, and blues.",
