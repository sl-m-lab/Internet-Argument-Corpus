   "\"When it comes to finger-pointing and name-calling, no media outlet does it better than MSNBC. When it comes to baseless new stories with an all-but-obvious radical liberal twist, no one does it better than the Democrat News Channel known as MSNBC.\n \n It's pretty obvious the real newsworthy story of this past week was the rising death toll of American troops in Afghanistan. This should have alarmed anyone following the war.\n \n But this past week, while channel surfing, I couldn't help but stop on MSNBC after seeing a news brief about President Obama and golf.\n \n It wasn't even mere minutes beforehand that I was learning about a helicopter crash in Afghanistan that left multiple American soldiers dead. At this particular moment, however, I was shocked out of my seat to see a couple of far-left talking heads bickering about Obama's golf outings and if there is a possibility that women are being left out of his extra-curricular activities.\n \n Excuse me, what, state-controlled propaganda network?\n \n This farce really wasn't much of a surprise considering the irony behind MSNBC's attack on FOX News (yes FOX should be in all caps) for being an extension of the Republican Party. After all, whatever talking points the White House and the New York Times vomits out for the day, you can bet MSNBC will be regurgitating them to their radical left-wing audience.\n \n I guess the folks at MSNBC would rather report on Obama's itinerary than pressing issues such as his inability to formulate a genuine strategy on Afghanistan or his lackadaisical performance on the economy.\n \n Is it any real wonder why MSNBC has no credibility left? Besides the fact that bomb-throwers like Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann's ratings are utterly in the tank, the only real news reporting coming out of that sinking ship might be sports, and even that is a stretch.\n \n Keep in mind that, in just a week, Chris Matthews compared Dick Cheney to the Hussein brothers who tortured millions in Iraq, Joy Behar (on her CNN show) agreed with far-left kook Gore Vidal when he regretted not murdering former President George W. Bush, CBS went after Sarah Palin for the millionth time and the White House ramped up talks of bailing out the newspaper industry so they can officially own all aspects of media.\n This was all in just a week!\n \n That's right folks, Joy Behar actually laughed and agreed that some XXXXX didn't act soon enough and murder the former president! This is unbelievable in America. That interview was not only outrageous but bordered on criminal. Can you imagine if someone on FOX had made a similar comment in regard to President Barack Obama, and the host laughed in total agreement?\n \n There is no place in society for this kind of behavior. Behar can call herself a comedian all day long, but no one is laughing. Regardless of political party or ideological differences, no American should joke about taking another's life. This is exactly why a lot of newspapers are continuing to fold up shop and shows like Behar's aren't surviving.\n \n And just yesterday, CNN's Lou Dobbs remarked on how he and his wife were shot at while at their home, 50 miles outside of New York City. Dobbs said he felt the shooting was because of his opposition to illegal immigration. This is what is happening in America today. If you are conservative, you may lose your life!\n \n Aside from the far-left media outlets like MSNBC, now you have the Golf Channel taking off -the-cuff shots at Dick Cheney and ESPN heralding Snoop D-O-double G in advertising, yet feeling Rush Limbaugh is too \"divisive\".\n \n In the words of legendary Packers coach Vince Lombardi, \"what the hell is going on out here\"?\n \n The approach the American media, as a whole, is taking toward conservatives is offensive, and they should be very careful. The latest Gallup poll revealed 40 percent of Americans identify themselves as conservative, and truth be told that number is probably higher because a lot of apolitical individuals do not know the meaning of conservative, yet are in nature.\n \n At the end of the day though, there are more issues of concern to Americans than the president allowing women to golf or shoot hoops with him, or what he is doing on a date night.\n \n We are at a critical turning point here in America. Will the real journalists please stand up? There is an old saying that goes something like, \"everything in life happens for a reason.\" It is probably a safe bet to say that MSNBC's daily message of hate is the exact reason that it barely has any ratings left.\n \n While it is true that every president should decompress from the daily grind, there is also legitimacy in questioning why this president would conduct one lavish party after the next, take multiple vacation \"get-a-ways\" and golf every week when millions of Americans are out of work and our troops are dying under his watch.\n \n Halloween is not the only reason it's getting pretty scary out there.\"",
