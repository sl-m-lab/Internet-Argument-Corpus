   "Kerry Voted Against Body Armor for U.S. Troops\n \n Likely Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry slammed President Bush over the weekend for not supplying U.S. troops in Iraq with enough body armor to protect them from attacks.\n \n But, it turns out, Sen. Kerry actually voted against supplying the troops with more body armor just last year.\n \n Addressing a Texas audience on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat said it was \"shocking\" that \"tens of thousands of other troops arrived in Iraq to find that - with danger around every corner - there wasn't enough body armor.\" \n \n But Bush campaign press secretary Scott Stanzel told WABC Radio's Steve Malzberg on Sunday that Kerry \"voted against supplying body armor to our troops when it mattered most\" - when President Bush included the request as part of the $87 billion appropriation for the Iraq war in 2003.\n \n RNC Chairman Marc Racicot confirmed the Kerry vote against body armor, telling ABC's \"This Week\" that the funding bill \"did everything from provide hazard pay for our troops in Iraq to body armor for our troops in Iraq.\"\n \n \"And yet he has the audacity yesterday to continue to complain about the fact that there was no body armor,\" Racicot complained.\n \n Asked about his vote not to protect the troops with new body armor, Sen. Kerry insisted he did no such thing. \n \n \"That $87 billion has nothing to do with the preparatory money\" for protective gear, he told the Fox News Channel. \n \n He then blamed President Bush for not supplying the body armor sooner, saying: \"The president made the decision of when to go to war. If you make that decision, you have to make sure your troops are properly equipped.\"",

   "I think that what people are missing on this one (in addition ot the whole rider attachment thing) is that when congress looked into this, they found that most soldier did not want the body armor.\n \n I don;t know if any of you have ever worn body armor, but it is hot, heavy and resttrics movement, and doen't do much as far as protecting our soldiers. FOr somebody lke a cop, whose greatest danger seems to be from relatively hig profile, low powered handguns, a buletproof vest is a great thing. To a soldier, whose greates threat is from explosives and shrapnel, a bullet proof vest is more an handicap than a benifit. I suppose it would help te ensure that in the wake of an explosion, the guys torso would be identifiable.\n \n THis is one of those things that the media took hold of and shook to death. There was a movement by police departments to send their old bullet proof vests to Iraq. According to my wifes uncle (Who is there) the ones his unit got are in a storage container because nobody was willing to wear them. HIs guys figure figure it is hot enough and they carry enough equipment without the added layer and weight of a bullet proof vest, and that having your movements restricted, even to the small extent that the vests are restrictive, is more likely to get you killed than the vest is to help.",

KERRY: &#8220;George, I said at the time I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.&#8221; (ABC News, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Columbia, SC, 5/4/03)\n \n \n \n Kerry Later Claimed He Voted &#8220;To Threaten&#8221; Use Of Force In Iraq. &#8220;I voted to threaten the use of force to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United Nations.&#8221; (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At Announcement Of Presidential Candidacy, Mount Pleasant, SC, 9/2/03)\n \n \n \n Now, Kerry Says He Is Anti-War Candidate. CHRIS MATTHEWS: &#8220;Do you think you belong to that category of candidates who more or less are unhappy with this war, the way it&#8217;s been fought, along with General Clark, along with Howard Dean and not necessarily in companionship politically on the issue of the war with people like Lieberman, Edwards and Gephardt? Are you one of the anti-war candidates?&#8221; KERRY: &#8220;I am -- Yes, in the sense that I don&#8217;t believe the president took us to war as he should have, yes, absolutely.&#8221; (MSNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Hardball,&#8221; 1/6/04)\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Round 2: Kerry Flip-Flopped On Eliminating Marriage Penalty For Middle Class\n \n \n \n Kerry Said He Will Fight To Keep Tax Relief For Married Couples. &#8220;Howard Dean and Gephardt are going to put the marriage penalty back in place.

John Kerry, Remarks At Town Hall Meeting, Manchester, NH, 8/6/03)\n \n \n \n Now, Kerry Attacks Patriot Act. &#8220;We are a nation of laws and liberties, not of a knock in the night. So it is time to end the era of John Ashcroft. That starts with replacing the Patriot Act with a new law that protects our people and our liberties at the same time. I&#8217;ve been a District Attorney and I know that what law enforcement needs are real tools not restrictions on American&#8217;s basic rights.&#8221; (Sen.

Consider this &#8216;Notebook&#8217; item from TNR&#8217;s March 25, 1991 issue, which ran under the headline &#8216;Same Senator, Same Constituent&#8217;: &#8216;Thank you for contacting me to express your opposition ... to the early use of military force by the US against Iraq. I share your concerns.

One such matter is the proposed Constitutional amendment that would prohibit or seriously inhibit any legal recognition whatsoever of same-sex relationships. We believe it would be a grave error for Massachusetts to enshrine in our Constitution a provision which would have such a negative effect on so many of our fellow residents. &#8230; We are therefore united in urging you to reject this Constitutional amendment and avoid stigmatizing so many of our fellow citizens who do not deserve to be treated in such a manner.&#8221; (Sen. John Kerry, et al, Letter To Members Of The Massachusetts Legislature, 7/12/02)\n \n \n \n Now, In 2004, Kerry Won&#8217;t Rule Out Supporting Similar Amendment. &#8220;Asked if he would support a state constitutional amendment barring gay and lesbian marriages, Kerry didn&#8217;t rule out the possibility. &#8216;I&#8217;ll have to see what language there is,&#8217; he said.&#8221; (Susan Milligan, &#8220;Kerry Says GOP May Target Him On &#8216;Wedge Issue,&#8217;&#8221; The Boston Globe, 2/6/04)\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Round 6: Flip-Flopped On Attacking President During Time Of War\n \n \n \n In March 2003, Kerry Promised Not To Attack President When War Began. &#8220;Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts &#8230; said he will cease his complaints once the shooting starts. &#8216;It&#8217;s what you owe the troops,&#8217; said a statement from Kerry, a Navy veteran of the Vietnam War. &#8216;I remember being one of those guys and reading news reports from home. If America is at war, I won&#8217;t speak a word without measuring how it&#8217;ll sound to the guys doing the fighting when they&#8217;re listening to their radios in the desert.&#8217;&#8221; (Glen Johnson, &#8220;Democrats On The Stump Plot Their War Rhetoric,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 3/11/03)\n \n \n \n But Weeks Later, With Troops Just Miles From Baghdad, Kerry Broke His Pledge. &#8220;&#8216;What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States,&#8217; Kerry said in a speech at the Peterborough Town Library. Despite pledging two weeks ago to cool his criticism of the administration once war began, Kerry unleashed a barrage of criticism as US troops fought within 25 miles of Baghdad.&#8221; (Glen Johnson, &#8220;Kerry Says Us Needs Its Own &#8216;Regime Change,&#8217;&#8221; The Boston Globe, 4/3/03)\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Round 7: Flip-Flopped On Death Penalty For Terrorists\n \n \n \n In 1996, Kerry Attacked Governor Bill Weld For Supporting Death Penalty For Terrorists. KERRY: &#8220;Your policy would amount to a terrorist protection policy. Mine would put them in jail.&#8221; (1996 Massachusetts Senate Debate, 9/16/96)\n \n \n \n In 1996, Kerry Said, &#8220;You Can Change Your Mind On Things, But Not On Life-And-Death Issues.&#8221; (Timothy J. Connolly, &#8220;The &#8216;Snoozer&#8217; Had Some Life,&#8221; [Worcester, MA] Telegram & Gazette, 7/3/96)\n \n \n \n But, In 2002, Kerry Said He Supported Death Penalty For Terrorists. KERRY: &#8220;The law of the land is the law of the land, but I have also said that I am for the death penalty for terrorists because terrorists have declared war on your country.&#8221; (NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet The Press,&#8221; 12/1/02)\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Round 8: Flip-Flopped On No Child Left Behind\n \n \n \n Kerry Voted For No Child Left Behind Act.

And it is divisive because it creates a &#8216;perception and a reality of reverse discrimination that has actually engendered racism.&#8217;&#8221; (Lynne Duke, &#8220;Senators Seek Serious Dialogue On Race,&#8221; The Washington Post, 4/8/92)\n \n \n \n In 2004, Kerry Denied Ever Having Called Affirmative Action &#8220;Divisive.&#8221; CNN&#8217;s KELLY WALLACE: &#8220;We caught up with the Senator, who said he never called affirmative action divisive, and accused Clark of playing politics.&#8221; SEN. KERRY: &#8220;That&#8217;s not what I said. I said there are people who believe that. And I said mend it, don&#8217;t end it. He&#8217;s trying to change what I said, but you can go read the quote. I said very clearly I have always voted for it. I&#8217;ve always supported it. I&#8217;ve never, ever condemned it. I did what Jim Clyburn did and what Bill Clinton did, which is mend it. And Jim Clyburn wouldn&#8217;t be supporting it if it were otherwise. So let&#8217;s not have any politics here.

It had a smaller tax cut but more tax cut for a stimulus, which is what we need. So you ask me, what do we need now? Yes, we need additional stimulus. We should absolutely not raise taxes.

   "As far as I can remember, Bush got his $87 Billion dollars. Are you saying that the troops never got their body armor? If we (our troops) weren't fully prepared to go to war, we shouldn't have done it. It was 100% instigated by the US and the time line was completely our own. If we're putting people in danger because of sub-standard equipment, shame on this administration. Kerry was one vote, and my guess is, there were many other items banded together in the $87 billion that he objected to. This administration doesn't exactly have a reputation of being \"thrifty\".",

   "Kerry has voted against/for just about everything. \n \n Check out www.gop.com\n \n ... yadda yadda yadda\n \nYou have posted this more times than I can remember. \n \n \n \nNow, Kerry Says He Is Anti-War Candidate. CHRIS MATTHEWS: \"Do you think you belong to that category of candidates who more or less are unhappy with this war, the way it's been fought, along with General Clark, along with Howard Dean and not necessarily in companionship politically on the issue of the war with people like Lieberman, Edwards and Gephardt? Are you one of the anti-war candidates?\" KERRY: \"I am -- Yes, in the sense that I don't believe the president took us to war as he should have, yes, absolutely.\" (MSNBC's \"Hardball,\" 1/6/04)\nSo what he is saying is that he agrees with the war, but not how it was conducted. I don't see any problem there.\n \n \n \nKerry Said He Will Fight To Keep Tax Relief For Married Couples. \"Howard Dean and Gephardt are going to put the marriage penalty back in place. So if you get married in America, we're going to charge you more taxes. I do not want to do that.\" (Fox News' \"Special Report,\" 10/23/03)\n \n Said Democrats Fought To End Marriage Penalty Tax. \"We fought hard to get rid of the marriage penalty.\" (MSNBC's \"News Live,\" 7/31/03)\n \n But, In 1998, Kerry Voted Against Eliminating Marriage Penalty Relief For Married Taxpayers With Combined Incomes Less Than $50,000 Per Year, Saving Taxpayers $46 Billion Over 10 Years. (S. 1415, CQ Vote #154: Rejected 48-50: R 5-49; D 43-1, 6/10/98, Kerry Voted Yea)\n Err so through the double negative, going against eliminating relief means he is for relief, exactly what is said in the first quotes.\n \n \nKerry Took BOTH Sides In First Gulf War In Separate Letters To Same Constituent. \"Rather than take a side--albeit the one he thought was most expedient--Kerry actually stood on both sides of the first Gulf war, much like he did this time around. Consider this 'Notebook' item from TNR's March 25, 1991 issue, which ran under the headline 'Same Senator, Same Constituent': 'Thank you for contacting me to express your opposition ... to the early use of military force by the US against Iraq. I share your concerns. On January 11, I voted in favor of a resolution that would have insisted that economic sanctions be given more time to work and against a resolution giving the president the immediate authority to go to war.' --letter from Senator John Kerry to Wallace Carter of Newton Centre, Massachusetts, dated January 22 [1991] 'Thank you very much for contacting me to express your support for the actions of President Bush in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. From the outset of the invasion, I have strongly and unequivocally supported President Bush's response to the crisis and the policy goals he has established with our military deployment in the Persian Gulf.' --Senator Kerry to Wallace Carter, January 31 [1991]\" (Noam Scheiber, \"Noam Scheiber's Daily Journal of Politics, The New Republic Online, 1/28/04)\nAgain I'd say he is here saying that he is pro-war, but wants to ensure it is conducted properly.\n \n \nNow, In 2004, Kerry Won't Rule Out Supporting Similar Amendment. \"Asked if he would support a state constitutional amendment barring gay and lesbian marriages, Kerry didn't rule out the possibility. 'I'll have to see what language there is,' he said.\" (Susan Milligan, \"Kerry Says GOP May Target Him On 'Wedge Issue,'\" The Boston Globe, 2/6/04)\n That's not a change of mind, he was just non-committal.\n \n \n \nRound 6: Flip-Flopped On Attacking President During Time Of War\nOk I'll not refute that one, but I don't think you can blame the guy for speaking his mind, regardless of what he said earlier.\n \n \n \nIn 1996, Kerry Attacked Governor Bill Weld For Supporting Death Penalty For Terrorists. KERRY: \"Your policy would amount to a terrorist protection policy. Mine would put them in jail.\" (1996 Massachusetts Senate Debate, 9/16/96)\nThere is no other information to this quote, I'd think it was taken out of context. I'd like to see the full quote before commenting.\n \n Etc etc etc. I would go through each one, but am at work and have not the time.\n \n I'm playing slight devil's advocate with many of the replies, and do agree that he has changed his mind a few too many times. But I'm just fed up of scrolling down through the exact same lengthy biased and semi-inaccurate post whenever I open a political thread.",

   "I think that what people are missing on this one (in addition ot the whole rider attachment thing) is that when congress looked into this, they found that most soldier did not want the body armor.\n \n I don;t know if any of you have ever worn body armor, but it is hot, heavy and resttrics movement, and doen't do much as far as protecting our soldiers. FOr somebody lke a cop, whose greatest danger seems to be from relatively hig profile, low powered handguns, a buletproof vest is a great thing. To a soldier, whose greates threat is from explosives and shrapnel, a bullet proof vest is more an handicap than a benifit. I suppose it would help te ensure that in the wake of an explosion, the guys torso would be identifiable.\n \n THis is one of those things that the media took hold of and shook to death. There was a movement by police departments to send their old bullet proof vests to Iraq. According to my wifes uncle (Who is there) the ones his unit got are in a storage container because nobody was willing to wear them. HIs guys figure figure it is hot enough and they carry enough equipment without the added layer and weight of a bullet proof vest, and that having your movements restricted, even to the small extent that the vests are restrictive, is more likely to get you killed than the vest is to help.\n You might trying to convince my son that they didn't want body armor. It has saved his life 3 times in the past two months.",

He wavers a lot because he is trying to say what will get him votes.\n \n Bush knows that the people who will vote for him, will do so becuase he sticks to his usual rhetoric. Thus, he has no reason to change it.\n \n Its all about making people happy",

   "You might trying to convince my son that they didn't want body armor. It has saved his life 3 times in the past two months.\n\n \n I am certainly glad that it helped your son avoid injury.\n \n Even so, from a realistic standpoint, it is more likely to get a soldier killed than to save them. It limits mobility and from a realistic standpoint protects very little. You can survive a LOT of abdomenal trauma, which is primarily what your body armor protects. From a realistic standpoint, the best protection as far as fatla wounds goes is a good helmet.\n \n While body armor can potentially save your life, it has is just as likely (mor if you really want to split hairs) to cuase you to be that fraction of a second too slow to get out of the way of that bomb, or that grenade, or to get out of the stream of fire from the heavy machine gun that kills you.\n \n \nI know I didnt like it much, and most soldiers I know are not big fans of it, including the one guy I know who have been in a combat zone.\n\n \n I refused to wear mine. While it is part of your typical loadout, most COs have always recognised that it is, in reality, a poor idea and allow it to be optional (you are better off carrying the same weight in ammo or an extra med pack.\n \n I have yet to see a guys life saved by body armor. I have seen guys take a little shrapnel in their vest, and even a coupel of guys take a round in it (one went through and injured the guy, the other didn't, though it wouldn;t have killed him).\n \n I have seen at least a dozen guys get killed because they couldn't get under cover quite fast enough, and if they had not been wearing that extra 20 lbs, there is a very good chance they would have made it (IMHO, that kind of thing is difficult to prove once you are dead).\n \n I have also seen more than one guy catch their rifle on their body armor, effectively disarming them during a fire fight (If all you can do is stand there with your rifle pointing at the ground while you try to untangle it, you are disarmed). I have even seen guys catch their armor on debris, leaving them stuck in the open.\n \n From what I personally have seen, body armor kills. it is better to be quick and mobile that armored and slow. i have heard a few stroeis abotu guys who have been saved by body armor, but considering that it provides only very minimal protection, I personally recommend to guys that they opt out on that particular piece of equipment if possible. \n \n It is like armored hummers. The armor is not really good enough to make it an armored vehicle, but is certainly heavy enoguh to limit its mobility and speed. Better not to have armor than to have bad armor.",
