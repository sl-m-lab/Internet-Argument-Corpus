   "Well, I will try again anyway.\n \n Some reasons I don't like Bush:\n \n 1. Cut funding for new energy research by 50%\n By doing this, Dubya is keeping us from researching new and better and clearner fuels. Which means we will have to pollute the Earth even longer. European nations are already researching Hydrogen fuel. The Earth doesn't have infant supply of Oil either. Oil is causing wars we should not be having.\n \n 2. Took away some of Clinton's National Monuments\n George W. Bush thinks its ok for major rich industries to tear our environment apart so they can even more money they don't even need. Not only does it destroy the planet, it murders animals. GWB proves that he doesn't give a damn about the environment. Whats stupid is that, he thinks in order to have a good economy, we must destroy the environment. He has been proved wrong a looonnngggg time ago.\n \n 3. Lied about WMD\n George W. Bush said that Saddam Hussein(So Damn Insane) possesed WMDs(weapons of mass destruction). After we went there, we did not find ANY WMDs. This WMD excuse was a fraud, in order to go to war. Somehow the media new that this was going to happen so they called it \"Iraqi Freedom\". If Bush were to say it was to free the people to begin with, mabey we would of though a little differantly.\n \n 4. He let John Ashcroft release the Patriot Act.\n This Patriot Act contributes to the Bush admin taking our civil liberties away. The Gov't can now read our emails, and if they think your a terrorist because of jokes you told, they come to your house and arrest and lock you up forever, and you are unable to have a trial. John Asscroft is proposing a Patriot Act II wich would allow this to be used against Protesters. We Liberals want our freedoms back. This is one of the worst things that happened\n \n 5. Bad Economy\n In the 90s, Clinton ended the reccesion of poppa Bush, and gave us an economic boom. This boom lasted through the 90s. However when Bush got into office, he stopped helping the economy. Disasters happened, and he failed to heal the economy. If Clinton was president, our economy wouldn't be nearly as bad, it may not be the boom of the 90s, but it sure won't the the reccesion of today.\n \n your turn........ lol ;)",

Oil is causing wars we should not be having.\n\n \n I thought the new energy policy increased funding for this research... do you have some stats on it? And the oil companies are also doing research on this, becuase they have 50 years left to live at current consumption. \n \n Edit: I just heard it reported that the Bush Administration is providing something around 2 billion dollars over the next five years.\n \n \n \n2.

Hussein had weeks to move or bury stuff, and we're 1/5 of the way explored. We have two labs and a lot of the chemicals that could be used to produce. There is also evidence of dumping... the Tigris and Euphrates have supposedly high levels of chemicals that could be used to produce WMD. The search is 1/5 over...\n \n \n \n4.

This is one of the worst things that happened\n\n \n Remember that the Democrats helped to pass this bill... and they still have to get warrants, it's just easier. And can you link me to this proposal that would allow protestors to be arrested? Even if it's true that will never get through Congress.\n \n \n \n5.

Read any book on that election and you will see that the media, which was pre-Fox and mainly left-wing, created an economic crisis. Look at the indicators... you'll see it.\n \n Look, the economies of almost every nation are bad. We're not just in a US recession, this is a world recession. And it started in the last two quarters of Clinton's term. The world economy is down, and Bush didn't do that...do you really want to try to say that Bush ruined the world economy two quarters before he even took office? Then we had 9/11, which wiped out 9 trillion dollars in the stock market. 9/11 was a devestating blow to an already shaky economy. The US looks ready to recover, but Europe and Asia are not. Those economies are still stalled, and we cannot recover without them. It doesn't matter who is president, that person can't fix the world economy.\n \n \n \n Please note that I do not support most Bush environmental policy... I will not defend the majority of it.",

I find that hard to believe. This bad economy is recent news, it did not start during Clinton's term. This wasn't an issue until the new decade.\n \n Another Issue about Bush:\n \n 6.Opposes Stem Cell research\n By opposing reasearch on Stem Cells, he is preventing Scientists from being able to cure such terrible diseases killing many people. The cells cannot become babies anyway, so why oppose something like this which would save so many lives.\n \n 7.Called Kim Jong Il an axis of evil\n By doing this he has made the leader of North Korea, a nuclear power, hostile of the US. This is not good news for the US thats for sure. \n \n 8.Cut funding from Education\n I don't need to explain how stupid this is, its obvious why cutting funding to education would be a very stupid idea.

   "Point 1: Obviously Clinton disagrees... he waited until he left. It was just a popularity and legacy move. \n \n Point 2: The UN was not planning action. The UN was planning 6 months of inspections, and the IAEA was about to certify Iraq free of a nuclear program. Then we find out he had four nuclear scientists on the payroll and nuclear plans and parts buried. \n \n Point 3: More Democrats than him. I'm going to try to find the voting record...\n \n Point 4: Until you have some sort of proof to back that up I'm just going to ignore it. That's a big allegation.\n \n Point 5: No, I mean before the election. The economy started to turn up while Bush was still in office... the Left managed to spin it and the media took it and ran, which meant Bush lost the election.\n \n Point 6: The bubble burst! Not just here, but everywhere! Tech companies got hit hard all over the world, and this is a worldwide recession. Asia and Europe are having more trouble than we are... turn on CNN International. You may not want to believe it because you want to blame Bush. Then there's 9/11... You skipped commenting on that. That had a gigantic impact on our economy and the world. \n \n And yes, it did start in Clinton's last two quarters in office... look at the economic indicators for his last two quarters if you know a good statistic web site.\n \n Point 6: Bush opposes certain procedures in stem cell research... not all stem cell research. I keep saying this and you don't listen.\n \n Point 7: You think a nation with no nuclear program can start one and have a nuke in a few months? North Korea violated the deal Clinton made almost right away... we gave them food, oil, money, and yes, two nuclear power plants, which is where they got the fuel. It's believed they restarted their nuclear program in 1996. It should also be pointed out that they had UN IAEA inspectors monitoring their nuclear program. They were able to do it anyway... \n \n Point 8: Cut funding? Can you show me the budget from last year and this year to prove that? The budget was up 8% this year...",

The capital gains tax is in half, dividend taxes gone for now, and since March the stock market is up 20%.\n \n \n The tax cuts are small and only benefit the rich. I am living in a middle class family and we don't have much more money. The tax cuts helped ruined our economy. The economy is still going down, even though Bush is saying that it is going up.

In Afghanistan, Bush replaced the Taliban with another terrible government. The man who shot his wife for not doing his laundre right is now one of the men in charge of that country.\n \n 2. In Iraq, Saddam was not an inmediate threat to the US. There are many leaders like him in the world. We may have gotten rid of him, but now post war Iraq is still miserable, and troops are dieing everyday.\n \n 3. In Africa, I agree with his decision to enter Liberia.

   "Please. I also live in a middle class family. Our total tax savings this year: $2300 on about $50,000 income. First year we've actually not owed anything in a long, long time. \n \n You must know nothing of the economy thinking that. The Nasdaq is up 31%, the Dow and S&P about 13% for the year. GDP growth was 2.4%, an amazing surprise, was just revised to 3%. Many economists are projecting 4% growth this quarter. In addition, companies are expected to make a record amount of profit, breaking the 1995 record. The job situation is better-than-expected. And do you know what economists keep talking about? The tax cuts. Even Germany and France are using tax cuts on their economies... places you'd love to live. Kennedy used tax cuts, Reagan used tax cuts, Clinton used tax cuts! Tax cuts work.\n \n __\n \n 1. Know nothing of it. Source?\n \n 2. That's an opinion. Iraq is much better off. And troops are no longer dying every day, either. A poll by a British magazine showed that 50% of Iraqis agreed with the war, 25% did not, and 25% were undecided. (those are all about numbers... can't remember the exacts, but they are only a point or three different.)\n \n 3. Why should we be deployed in Africa? Liberia is our former colony. Europe should be there assisting those nations, and Europe is. It's their fault! They're the ones who drew the borders and left ethnic groups in chaos. They need to fix it.\n \n __\n \n 1. Bush does not oppose social security. You made that up. Asking me to show you who do is like asking for a source when someone says he's the president. Please. \n \n Bush didn't cut that funding, Congress did. Congress also increased the budget of that department by a large amount... medical funding was just cut.\n \n __\n \n They may be conservative, but by no strech are they extremists. I wouldn't call the liberals on the bench extremists or corrupted. :-\\ You just want only liberals on the bench, because it's the only office they won't need to be elected to.\n \n __\n \n Breaking treaties when it's in the best interest of your is a good idea. He didn't break it... he pulled out. And it was convered... Democrats argued about it a lot, and they still mention it often.\n \n __\n \n You do realize that we had a RECORD LOW in TERRORIST ATTACKS. It's not opinion, it's fact, spin it however you want. You can do to the State Department web site and read the report.\n \n __\n \n MINIMAL!?!?! 16 BILLION.... calm... calm... you can do this. If you think even a billion barrels is a tiny amount... :-\\ Bush pushed billions into alternative fuel research... and the oil companies that you hate are doing the same thing.\n \n __\n \n You know that I oppose most Bush environmental policy... don't even bother.",
