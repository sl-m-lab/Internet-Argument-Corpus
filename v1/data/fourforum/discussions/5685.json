Governer Will Attempt Gay-Nup Ban\n Thursday, June 16, 2005\n \n Mass. Court to Hear Bid to Stop Gay Marriages\n BOSTON - Gov. Mitt Romney (search) will support a citizen-led effort to put a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages (search) on a statewide ballot, a spokesman said Thursday.\n \n The proposed initiative would also not allow civil unions (search) for same-sex couples. A separate, proposed amendment now pending before the Legislature would ban gay marriages but legalize Vermont-style civil unions.\n \n \"Governor Romney believes that voters should be given a straightforward amendment to decide the definition of marriage and not one that muddies the water by creating civil unions that would be equivalent of marriage in all respects but name,\" said Romney's spokesman, Eric Fehrnstrom.\n \n Opponents of gay marriage plan to annouce the new citizen initiative later Thursday.\n \n The state's highest court ruled in November 2003 that the state constitution guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry. The nation's first state-sanctioned, same-sex weddings began taking place May 17, 2004, and since then, thousands of couples have tied the knot.\n \n However, the Legislature last March passed a proposed constitutional amendment that would ban the marriages but allow for civil unions. That proposed amendment must be passed in identical form again this year in order to appear on a state ballot in November 2006.",

ET \n \n (Boston, Massachusetts) The Massachusetts legislature will take up the second phase of a proposal to amend the state Constitution to ban gay marriage this year, but a new poll shows most voters want the effort abandoned.\n \n The Bay State Poll, taken for the Eagle-Tribune, and released on Monday, shows that most people in Massachusetts have grown comfortable with same-sex marriage.\n \n \"We have it. It's been happening. The sky is not falling,\" said Bay State pollster Russell K. Mayer, the director of the Center for Public Opinion Research at Merrimack College.\n \n The poll found 52 percent of respondents do not want to see the amendment on the ballot. \n \n Last march lawmakers approved the proposed amendment which would define marriage as a union of a man and a woman. It would, however, allow civil unions with legal marriage rights (story) It must be approved again in this session of the legislature in order to go to voters in 2006.\n \n Same-sex marriage became legal in Massachusetts in May 17, 2004\n \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/02/020705massPoll.htm",

They have never developed the capacity for mature sexual relationships with other adults, either men or women. \n Over the years, this fact has been incorporated into various schemes for categorizing child molesters. For example, Finkelhor and Araji (1986) proposed that perpetrators' sexual attractions should be conceptualized as ranging along a continuum with exclusive interest in children at one extreme, and exclusive interest in adult partners at the other end. \n \n Typologies of offenders have often included a distinction between those with an enduring primary preference for children as sexual partners and those who have established age-appropriate relationships but who become sexually involved with children under unusual circumstances of extreme stress. Perpetrators in the first category - those with a more or less exclusive interest in children - have often been labeled fixated. Fixation means \"a temporary or permanent arrestment of psychological maturation resulting from unresolved formative issues which persist and underlie the organization of subsequent phases of development\" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 176). Many clinicians view fixated offenders as being \"stuck\" at an early stage of psychological development. \n \n By contrast, other molesters are described as regressed. Regression is \"a temporary or permanent appearance of primitive behavior after more mature forms of expression had been attained, regardless of whether the immature behavior was actually manifested earlier in the individual's development\" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 177). Regressed offenders have developed an adult sexual orientation but under certain conditions (such as extreme stress) they return to an earlier, less mature psychological state and engage in sexual contact with children. \n \n Some typologies of child molesters break the fixation-regression distinction into multiple categories, and some include additional categories as well (e.g., Knight, 1989). For the present discussion, the important point is that many child molesters cannot be meaningfully described as homosexuals, heterosexuals, or bisexuals because they are not really capable of a relationship with an adult man or woman. Instead of gender, their sexual attractions are based primarily on age. These individuals - who are often characterized as fixated - are attracted to children, not to men or women. \n \n Using the fixated-regressed distinction, Groth and Birnbaum (1978) studied 175 adult males who were convicted in Massachusetts of sexual assault against a child. None of the men had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation. 83 (47%) were classified as \"fixated;\" 70 others (40%) were classified as regressed adult heterosexuals; the remaining 22 (13%) were classified as regressed adult bisexuals. Of the last group, Groth and Birnbaum observed that \"in their adult relationships they engaged in sex on occasion with men as well as with women. However, in no case did this attraction to men exceed their preference for women....There were no men who were primarily sexually attracted to other adult males...\" (p.180). \n \n http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html",

But you are being intentionally dishonest when you try to explain away any case of a someone trying to engage in homosexual acts with an underage person by saying \"oh he's a pedophile' that has nothing to do with being gay.\" Don't be silly. You know as well as I do that some or many of those priests who were obviously attracted to same-sex boys were gay. This idea that sexual orientation doesn count if it's a case of anyone being underage or even a child in the situation is ludicrous, especially if you are going to, in other instances portray sexual orientation as so inescapable and an all-powerful influence on human behavior.

They have never developed the capacity for mature sexual relationships with other adults, either men or women. \n Over the years, this fact has been incorporated into various schemes for categorizing child molesters. For example, Finkelhor and Araji (1986) proposed that perpetrators' sexual attractions should be conceptualized as ranging along a continuum with exclusive interest in children at one extreme, and exclusive interest in adult partners at the other end. \n \n Typologies of offenders have often included a distinction between those with an enduring primary preference for children as sexual partners and those who have established age-appropriate relationships but who become sexually involved with children under unusual circumstances of extreme stress. Perpetrators in the first category - those with a more or less exclusive interest in children - have often been labeled fixated. Fixation means \"a temporary or permanent arrestment of psychological maturation resulting from unresolved formative issues which persist and underlie the organization of subsequent phases of development\" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 176). Many clinicians view fixated offenders as being \"stuck\" at an early stage of psychological development. \n \n By contrast, other molesters are described as regressed. Regression is \"a temporary or permanent appearance of primitive behavior after more mature forms of expression had been attained, regardless of whether the immature behavior was actually manifested earlier in the individual's development\" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 177). Regressed offenders have developed an adult sexual orientation but under certain conditions (such as extreme stress) they return to an earlier, less mature psychological state and engage in sexual contact with children. \n \n Some typologies of child molesters break the fixation-regression distinction into multiple categories, and some include additional categories as well (e.g., Knight, 1989). For the present discussion, the important point is that many child molesters cannot be meaningfully described as homosexuals, heterosexuals, or bisexuals because they are not really capable of a relationship with an adult man or woman. Instead of gender, their sexual attractions are based primarily on age. These individuals - who are often characterized as fixated - are attracted to children, not to men or women. \n \n Using the fixated-regressed distinction, Groth and Birnbaum (1978) studied 175 adult males who were convicted in Massachusetts of sexual assault against a child. None of the men had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation. 83 (47%) were classified as \"fixated;\" 70 others (40%) were classified as regressed adult heterosexuals; the remaining 22 (13%) were classified as regressed adult bisexuals. Of the last group, Groth and Birnbaum observed that \"in their adult relationships they engaged in sex on occasion with men as well as with women. However, in no case did this attraction to men exceed their preference for women....There were no men who were primarily sexually attracted to other adult males...\" (p.180). \n \n http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html",

You don't need to defend that at this point. You guys are so worried about that association that you can hardly have a rational discussion about it. First, like so many other things, pedophilia is not an all-or-nothing issue--it probably manifests itself in degrees with different people. In other words, there probably ARE some pedophiles who are not even attracted to adults, and there are probably plenty that are. Second, you still can't get away from the fact that on some level, pedophiles obviously have a sexual orientation because they are selective about the gender of their victims. Third, this can get very grey because child molestation doesn't just include little children who's bodies haven't developed, but also young adults who are underage and who sometimes are certainly NOT \"asexual\" in appearance.

   "Most paraphilic fantasies begin in late childhood or adolescence and continue throughout adult life. Intensity and occurrence of the fantasies are variable, and they usually decrease as people get older.\n http://www.psychnet-uk.com/dsm_iv/pedophilia.htm \nThere is very little certainty about what causes a paraphilia. Psychoanalysts generally theorize that these conditions represent a regression to or a fixation at an earlier level of psychosexual development resulting in a repetitive pattern of sexual behavior that is not mature in its application and expression. In other words, an individual repeats or reverts to a sexual habit arising early in life. Another psychoanalytic theory holds that these conditions are all expressions of hostility in which sexual fantasies or unusual sexual acts become a means of obtaining revenge for a childhood trauma. The persistent, repetitive nature of the paraphilia is caused by an inability to erase the underlying trauma completely. Indeed, a history of childhood sexual abuse is sometimes seen in individuals with paraphilias.\n \n However, behaviorists suggest, instead, that the paraphilia begins via a process of conditioning. Nonsexual objects can become sexually arousing if they are frequently and repeatedly associated with a pleasurable sexual activity. The development of a paraphilia is not usually a matter of conditioning alone; there must usually be some predisposing factor, such as difficulty forming person-to-person sexual relationships or poor self-esteem.\n http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/sexual_perversions.jsp \nThere are many theories that try to explain the origin of an aberrant sexual fantasy, thought or behavior in persons, but a final explanation is not known yet. We often assume that they originate or are formed in puberty. There are two important explanations for the development of sexual variation. Explanations that come from the idea of social development - how people treat each other - assume that something is wrong with the ability of these people to get involved in a relationship. This inability would be expressed in the form of sexual variation. Exhibitionism and voyeurism are then seen as clumsy attempts to make contact. Another explanation is that of coincidental connections between arousal and a certain situation or act. It is assumed that you want to repeat the experience that led to arousal. \n http://web4health.info/en/answers/sex-paraphi-causes.htm",

His children actually said he was a loving and attentive father. \n \n BUT...\n \n His victims were male. \n \n The thing is most pedophilial serial killers, like Mr. Gacy, don't actually regard their victims as having any gender at all. They don't even regard them as human beings. They see them as inanimate objects.\n \n But, as in the cases of the priests, most of them actually self identify as heterosexual as well. \n The difference is that their pedophilia was enacted upon boys. Why? Simple. \n It's what they had access to! \n (DUH, moment here)\n The thing is that most pedophiles who go for prepubescent children don't really see their victims as having a specific gender. Prepubescent boys and girls phyisically look similar. \n \n \n So, again, just to emphasize my statement: \"Homosexual Pedophile\" is a CLINICAL term identifying the gender relation of the VICTIMS...not the SEXUALITY of the PREDATOR! \n \n Do you get it now?",

   "That's not true. Studies have been posted here. There is no correlation between adult sexual orientation and the sex of the child the pedophile chooses. It's you who is very ignorant on this subject. Can someone who is a heterosexual target opposite sex kids? Yes. The heterosexual can also target kids of the same sex. He(usually a man) is doing so, not because of his heterosexuality, but because he is a pedophile. The fact that he very well may target an opposite sex kid, doesn't change that. I feel like I am talking to a brick wall. You don't have a sophisticated knowledge of sexuality. You are looking to re-write the textbooks. It's not going to happen.\n \n A pedophile is an adult who is attracted to children. This is not the same category as someone who is gay or straight.\n\n \n But the problem with priests abusing kids (which is what we've been discussing here) is not just a problem involving pre-pubescent children. I agree that gays are no more likely to be pedophiles than anyone else, but to act like this priest problem is completely isolated from the issue of homosexuality is to bury one's head in the sand.\n \"Many dioceses may have taken care of the victims with adequate counselling, while the priest involved was allowed to resume ministry after a period in a treatment center, followed by approval from the same treatment center to resume ministry away from adolescent youth.\n \n I say adolescent youth - most often male - because over the years, very few priests have been involved in acts of pedophilia. Unfortunately, the few were involved in many acts with children from 1983 to 2000 in Louisiana (Lafayette) and in Massachusetts (Boston - Fall River). The media, however, has made the actions of a few pedophile priests the main problem. Bad as it is, the main problem of errant priestly crimes is not in the area of pedophilia, which is strictly defined as an adult having sexual relations with someone below the age of puberty (12), but rather in the phenomena of priests with homosexual inclinations seeking out vulnerable youth. The secular press refuses to recognize that these priests are actively homosexual, not pedophiles. All such priests are called pedophile priests by the media who said that the Pope called the Cardinals together to solve the problem of \"pedophile priests\". And so on.\"\n http://couragerc.net/ongoing_reflections_on_scandals.htm",
