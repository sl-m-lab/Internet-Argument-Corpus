   "http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/may2005/nf20050518_4924_db016.htm\n \n The link is to an artilce discussing something that a few people here have mentioned as being a factor in the housing boom/(really a bubble). This is going to be a nasty little suprise for many people. Some of the numbers for interest only loans is shocking, and definately is a large factor in the rising cost of housing.\n \n \nHere are some scary statistics: In 2004, fully 50.4% of the mortgage loans issued for purchases of single-family homes in Georgia were to pay interest only. That made the Peach State No. 1 in the nation in its share of interest-only mortgages. But a whole bunch of other states were not far behind: California was second, at 47.1%, Colorado third, at 45.5%, Nevada fourth, at 44.7%, and the District of Columbia, fifth at 43.8%. \n \n snip\n \n WRONG USERS. Interest-only mortgages were designed for wealthy families who used the loans as cash-flow management tools and could, if necessary, pay off the entire sum by liquidating some stocks and bonds. They can also be a good choice for people who have irregular incomes and strong self-discipline. \n \n Such families can pay interest only in the lean months, then voluntarily make big principal payments in months when they have lots of income. Other natural candidates: People who are quite sure that their incomes will be rising sharply, like young doctors just out of medical school. \n \n Trouble is, the sheer numbers indicate that the loans are also being taken out by a much bigger sector of the public -- people who are struggling to get into a rising housing market and feel that they couldn't get the properties they want any other way. \n \n \"BUYERS HAVE NO IDEA.\" Often, interest-only borrowers argue that they will refinance or sell their homes before the principal payments start coming due. But the risks are high. If they refinance, the new payment could be higher than the old one. And if they sell, they need to hope that prices have kept rising. Otherwise, they won't even recoup all of their downpayment\n",

One can make the case that if the interest payment for a mortgage doesn't exceed the rent payment that would otherwise be made if they didn't own the property that it would be economically sound. Assuming that the property appreciated in value, the owner would receive a benefit at the time the property was sold as well as the tax write-off. But on balance I don't like the idea UNLESS the person has sufficient wealth that it doesn't matter. Then it would make perfect sense and would be somewhat analogous to the financial transactions of our federal government. Our government can afford to increase the national debt so long as our GDP rises commensurately. A Warren Buffett could have a thousand homes with interest only mortgages and it could be seen as a good investment vehicle.",

   "This makes me curious, and you all seem knowledgable on the topic, so I want to ask.\n \n I myself recently purchased a place with a 5-year interest-only mortgage. The place is out of my reach, franky, because I live in the Washington DC area and housing costs around here are outrageous. \n \n The thing is, I've only been out of school for a few years, and expect to be working my way up the pay scale in the next few years. I'm also engaged and will be married in the next year or so, and my fiancee works and actually makes more than I do, so my income will become \"our\" income and payments will be much easier to make. \n \n The real justification I was given by my financial advisor for the interest-only deal was that I am unlikely to be staying in this place for more than a few years (the reason for buying it was that I was tired of paying $1000/month to a landlord when it could go to a mortgage). Also, at the moment I'm not having any trouble making the monthly \"minimums\", and actually wind up paying substantially more that that, so that at the end of the year I'm managing to pay down the prinicipal too. At any rate, since I will likely sell this place in the next few years when I move on, my financial advisor recommended this sort of mortgage for me, especially since in the DC area housing prices have done nothing but climb for as long as anyone can remember. \n \n Was I a good candidate for an interest only?",

   "I myself recently purchased a place with a 5-year interest-only mortgage. The place is out of my reach, franky, because I live in the Washington DC area and housing costs around here are outrageous. \n\n \n I can sy,mpathise with that. My sister recently moved to baltimore and paid $500,000 for a house that would go for $70,000 in the midwest.\n \n \nThe thing is, I've only been out of school for a few years, and expect to be working my way up the pay scale in the next few years. I'm also engaged and will be married in the next year or so, and my fiancee works and actually makes more than I do, so my income will become \"our\" income and payments will be much easier to make. \n\n \n the question at this point is will the real estate market hold out long enough for you to sell the place? I am not sure there is anybody credible out there still claimingn that we are not seeing a real estate bubble. If you can get out from under the place with a profit before it bursts, you are in good shape. If not, you could wind up badly upside down in your house.\n \n \nThe real justification I was given by my financial advisor for the interest-only deal was that I am unlikely to be staying in this place for more than a few years (the reason for buying it was that I was tired of paying $1000/month to a landlord when it could go to a mortgage). \n\n \n This depends again on how long th emarket lasts. I know a guy who owns 15-20 apartment buildings around the coutry, condos, rental homes, the works, and in the last year he has comletley liquidated residential properties (outside of apartments). Last month, he sold his personal residence for 4.8 million dollars and moved into a penthous at one of his apartment buildings. His explanation for this action was that he could get 4.8 million for his home this year, but would be lucky to get 3 for it a year from now. \n \n This would also depend on your mortgage payment. If your minumum (interest) payment is cheaper than rent, you are not really loosing anything as long as the home does not drop in value. If all you are paying is interest, you are essentially renting your home from the bank anyway.\n \n \nAlso, at the moment I'm not having any trouble making the monthly \"minimums\", and actually wind up paying substantially more that that, so that at the end of the year I'm managing to pay down the prinicipal too. At any rate, since I will likely sell this place in the next few years when I move on, my financial advisor recommended this sort of mortgage for me, especially since in the DC area housing prices have done nothing but climb for as long as anyone can remember. \n \n Was I a good candidate for an interest only?\n\n \n Frankly, no. Interset only loans can be good wealth management tools. Most of the conjecture I have seen as far as home values in the DC area put them apporximatly 40% over value. Unless you have enough cash on hand to make up 40% of the value of the home, you could find yourself in hot water (or 40% equity in the home). \n \n There is a guy who lives across the section form me that recently refinaced his home with an interest only mortgage. He was a good canidate for such a loan. His home is valued at around $150,000 and he has $400,000 in convertible investments. His note on his house (before the refinancing) was only $14,000 at around 5%.\n \n His average investment return is around 20%. So he refinanced his home with an interest only mortgage at say 6% (I don't know what kind of rate he got....probably lower than 6%) and he ends up with an extra $150,000 in cash that he can invest with an average return of 20%. This means he is making 14% by financing the home, or, viewed another way, makes 6% of his return tax deductible. If something happens and his home revalues, he will certainly take a hit, but estimated revaluation is not great in our area so it is unlikely that he would see even a 10% hit.\n \n These are the kind of folks who are supposed to be using interest only morgages. \n \n If indeed we are facing a real estate bubble (and all current indicators seem to show that we certainly are), the answer to your question is essentially \"it depends on when the bubble breaks\".",

   "I think we've been through this, interest only loans have been around for as long as money. Virtually every successful business uses them for inexpensive operating capital and there would be little home building without them. Mortgage companies started using them for consumer loans because lower payments allow qualification of a new sector of borrowers. They opened markets to lower income qualification and middle market allowing people to step up to something conventional qualifying ratios couldn't justify.\n \n As Daewoo points out, the big danger is an inevitable RE market adjustment where the borrower is upside down. For that reason, they were always considered a leverage tool utilized to make money, not finance the purchase of a personal residence. \n \n I've long carried interest only loans on my homes every time rates have offered a positive spread against short-term investments. But I never exceed 50% of assessed value and stay liquid enough to pay them off if economic conditions do change. And change is guaranteed. \n \n On the subject of financial advisers, I recommend caution in every instance. Unless it happens to be your tax CPA or lawyer who knows your financial circumstances and derives primary income from a profession where ethics or lack of can be grounds for a lawsuit, deep pockets, most 'financial advisers' get a piece of whatever they recommend. That includes loan finder fees, brokerage referral fees, bank referral fees and anything else that can be nicked. An individual simply won't see it, focusing on the hourly or flat rate advisement charge. I'd strongly recommend that any young professional establish early relationships with both a recommended CPA who specializes only in tax matters, not a bean counter, and a trust lawyer. And not classmates, choose people who have at least ten solid years of experience with an established firm and are or nearing partnership in those firms. Both will save a lot of money and grief over the long haul and you'll also meet a better class of people for future connections if upward mobility is in your plan.",

   "I can sy,mpathise with that. My sister recently moved to baltimore and paid $500,000 for a house that would go for $70,000 in the midwest.\n\n \n Sounds about right. I remember looking at a 2 br. condo around here that had already sold--ran into the guy a few days later in line at the FedEx store and asked him how it went, since he was looking to buy a place with what he made off the condo--he said he bought a 5 br. house in Michigan with what he sold the 2 br. condo for.\n \n \nthe question at this point is will the real estate market hold out long enough for you to sell the place? I am not sure there is anybody credible out there still claimingn that we are not seeing a real estate bubble. If you can get out from under the place with a profit before it bursts, you are in good shape. If not, you could wind up badly upside down in your house.\n\n \n Well the other factor I left out--my parents are helping me to the tune of the maximum non-taxable gift limit (I think it's $20k/yr.). With that, it works out such that I make my monthly payments with no problems and anything I pay on a monthly basis goes to the principal. \n \n Re: the real estate market. I don't know how long before the bubble bursts out here, but I can say that the area I live in is building up rapidly. New stores and office buildings are popping up around me, movie theaters, etc. New developments are going in as well, so I at least don't feel like my particular neighborhood will suffer a massive collapse. And since I bought the place a few neighbors have sold their places (slightly smaller and less amenities) for more than I paid for mine, so at least for the moment I'm on the upside. I don't plan on being in that place for more than a few years.\n \n \nThis would also depend on your mortgage payment. If your minumum (interest) payment is cheaper than rent, you are not really loosing anything as long as the home does not drop in value. If all you are paying is interest, you are essentially renting your home from the bank anyway.\n\n \n Right--given the help I'm getting from my parents here, I think I'm probably alright. In terms of my own personal finances, if I don't consider the income from my parents, every penny I put towards the mortgage goes towards the prinicipal. I'm paying roughly what I was paying every month in rent before, or trying to when the costs of owning a home don't cut into my budget (no more landlord to call when that light fixture breaks!).\n \n At any rate, good to know. I'll have to make a point not to get too attached to this place and make it a priority to figure out some next steps lest I get burned.",
