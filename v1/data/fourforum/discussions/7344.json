(CNN) -- A capsule carrying dust particles from the tail of a comet parachuted to Earth on Sunday, and elated NASA scientists were eager to examine the samples for clues about how the solar system formed.\n \n The Stardust mission capsule landed two minutes ahead of schedule at the Air Force's Utah Test and Training Range southwest of Salt Lake City.\n \n \"We traveled almost 3 billion miles in space,\" principal investigator Don Brownlee said from nearby Dugway Proving Grounds. \"We visited a comet, grabbed a piece of it, and it landed here this morning. It's an incredible thrill.\"\n \n The canister containing the samples was taken to a \"clean room\" at the proving grounds; it will be shipped to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, this week.\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/01/15/stardust/index.html",
