Of course, today Bush has been backpedalling in speeches because of his \"slip.\" He can't even keep his rhetoric straight. I guess he is \"flip-flopping.\"\n\n \n Personnally, I never bought into the idea that we could \"win\" the war on terrorism. Our very presence in the Middle East and our policies in that region are fueling the war itself. I was a little suprised to hear the highest ranking Republican admit it though. Unfortunately, most of the rank and file party members seem to be satisfied that by committing billions of dollars and thousands of American troops to the Middle East, we're all somehow better off. Oh well, with the election only 2 months away, it's time to start bracing Americans for 4 more years of looking over our shoulders while our government tries to educate Middle Easterners on how they should live like us.",

These were not military targets, thoguh they certainly were missed by the military. Maybe this is the new face of war, we are all just a bunch of terrorists.\n\n \n Daewoo, any war ever fought in all of history has involved civilian casualties. Does that mean that every military ever has been a collection of terrorists?\n \n The targets you described we hit in Iraq are perfectly legitimate targets in a war. The difference, I believe that most of you 'it's all America's fault' guys fail to realize, is in how we attack, and how the terrorists attack. We use precision guided munitions to strike as isolated a target as possible and not kill tons of civilians nearby. Sure, some of them are killed, but that can't be helped and we try to avoid it. The terrorists, on the other hand, are not worried solely on the destruction of a strategic target, but on killing as many civilians as possible. If we fought the way they did but with our technology, we'd have carpet-bombed Iraq into the ground.\n \n As far as targeting politicians goes...it's fine and dandy to not kill politicians, but what do you do when they put on a second hat that reads \"General?\" Hussein was a politician, but he was also an element of the Iraqi military, and ever since the wars of the 1700-1800s, military commanders are, and can be considered, targets.",

   "3000+ Iraqi civilians in the initial invasion and another 7000 since doesn't say much for precision guided munitions, especially when the current spin is freeing them from a dictator and instilling democracy. \n \n Neither side makes much of a distinction between civilian and military targets, that's just one of the facts of warfare. The primary reason US citizens become so agitated about 9/11 losses is the fact that we, spending 10 times what the rest of the developed world together spends on 'defense', were attacked on our home ground. We're more accustomed to spreading death to others in their homelands with reduced US casualties to pacify the public. When comparing our terrorist activities, defined by attacking citizens, in Vietnam and S. America to 9/11, 9/11 becomes a pathetic rallying point to condone our ME Policies. \n \n The 'War on Terror' simply isn't winnable without total elimination or domination of those we consider our enemies, a very large group of countries and people. Since we don't have the logistical or financial means to accomplish that with conventional forces, that leaves three choices:\n \n Nukes, which would bring retaliation in kind\n Living in our current paranoid state and economically depleting ourselves\n Changing our ME foreign policy\n \n Crusaders will argue that we do have conventional capability of dominating all ME and other Islamic nations, showing their lack of knowledge regarding our economic circumstances and dependency on other nations facilitating credit to keep our nation's head above water.

You are right, though, the attack ont he pentagon was not terrorism. It was a military target.\n \n At one time, attacking our politicians may have been an act of terrorism, but I don't think that is the case any more. It was for years considered taboo to target political leaders, since if we target thier political leaders, they might target ours, and politicians don't want to be killed, that is what we pay soldiers $1000 per moth for. \n \n It seems that in our last few \"wars\", we have been targeting politicians, so maybe that is the new game.

The US launched an attack on the restaurant on the belief that Saddam was their. He wasnt, this resulted in the deaths of innocent people, who were not warned of the attack and had no way to defend themselves.\n \n Except for the delivery method of the Attack.

Government refocus (propaganda) is now so effective that Americans have switched from accepting unfounded threats of Iraq WMDs to moralistic, crusader rationalizations as sound reasoning for invading and occupying a sovereign nation. \n \n That other nations (Iraq) or organizations (Bin Laden, Hamas, etc.) use death to all Americans in war again illustrates the lack of depth in understanding of our enemies or ourselves by a majority of Americans. We, the US, pride ourselves on being part of a democratic republic where the citizens elect representatives who govern in a manner that reflects the desires of their constituents. To any reasonable person, that means US administration is merely acting on behalf of the citizens.

Some mechanic turned called-up reservist may be mistreating Iraqi civilians in a prison, we 'regretfully' bomb a wedding party or detain thousands of arrested suspects with no due cause, and in the eyes of the world (except the general US population), those actions represent the US public at war. \n \n Our administration, just as in early Vietnam, has used the ages-old 'if you don't agree, you're unpatriotic' scenario to inflame US support for their actions. It's far easier to steer a crowd to war if their Uncle Sid or someone a distant friend barely knew, or just another American was killed in the 9/11 incident. Americans tend to use their emotions rather than facts and reason in passing judgment, leading to, among other pure rationalizations, ludicrous definitions of terrorism and war.",

   "True. The die is cast. We're doing a pretty good job of forgetting the 'War on Terror' and depleting ourselves in the process. Nothing will change until our fiscal irresponsibility catches up with us. There's no plunder or markets to exploit in this one. No China to keep us in line. \n \n Considering the small size of Bin Laden's organization with its complex cell structure, operational planning against the US on a domestic basis would be very time consuming. Didn't reports say he spent over five years putting 9/11 together? 9/11 caused a great deal of physical destruction, all covered by insurance, with a relatively small loss of life.\n \n Since our current administration is telling the public the government says they're safe, I'd think his next attack would be focused on accomplishing a mission resulting in a much higher loss of life without using nuclear devices. Despite declarations by government, as long as he doesn't use public air transportation or target federal facilities, his potential targets with large numbers of people grouped together are almost unlimited in scope. \n \n Superbowl security should be interesting as a display of how safe the government thinks we are.

   "Those poor choices, regardless of anyone's political affiliations, start at the roots of political action, local elections. That 25% of registered voters is considered a good turnout for a muni election provides insight as to how special interests have always controlled our destiny. Then it goes up the line; city committee vote for larger cities, county committee vote to regional to state to national political committee votes, all determining who will carry their party's flag. If you've ever been involved with a political party, you'll understand that party direction is all that counts.

   "An accurate assessment. Americans enjoyed such a long run of prosperity from our post-WW11 domination of world markets that individual interests in how they were being governed wasn't an issue. There was a chicken in every pot. By the third or fourth generation, that apathy was widespread, predominately in the lower and middle classes. Special interest power blossomed in the late '50s and through the '60s with massive expenditures for space exploration, the Cold War, social engineering and Vietnam. The money involved was somewhat beyond comprehension, fueled by prosperity, deficit spending and the breaking of public trusts such as SS and fuel taxes. The immensity of special interests brought lobbyists into prominence to consolidate the numerous special interest requirements and demands on government, adding power by sheer numbers to the special interest entities and groups.
