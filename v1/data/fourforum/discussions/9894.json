   "John Grisham, author of \"The Innocent Man\", published by \"Doubleday Random House\" and Dennis Fritz author of \"Journey Toward Justice\", published by \"Seven Locks Press\" Santa Ana, CA have a long term commitment to making appearances related to \"the innocence movement\" nationwide.\n Grisham's first nonfiction book, \"The Innocent Man\" is a best seller on Amazon worldwide. Dennis Fritz has his first book \"Journey Toward Justice\" on Amazon and is a top seller worldwide.\n \n The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town, is a chronicle of the Oklahoma case that resulted in the wrongful conviction of former minor-league baseball player Ron Williamson and his friend Dennis Fritz. Once asked whether his book is a kind of social activism, he says: \"When I researched and wrote the book, it was impossible not to become indignant and infuriated. And that becomes an activism in itself.\"\n \n Journey Toward Justice: Dennis Fritz tells his side of the story of his unwarranted prosecution and wrongful conviction, that changed his life and a small community forever. Dennis Fritz was tried and convicted on non-existent evidence, the false testimony of jailhouse snitches, faulty forensics work and suppressed evidence.\n \n Together and Separately they attend many fundraising events and appear on Television and Radio Talk Shows.\n May 22 both John Grisham and Dennis Fritz will be on Dateline.\n \n Grisham spoke Thursday May 10th at the Hyatt Regency Crown Center, In Kansas City for an Innocence Project fundraiser. The Innocence Project is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing legal aid to prisoners \"with persuasive actual innocence claims\" in Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska,Iowa, Oklahoma and Arkansas. Sponsors were the Midwestern Innocence Project, the McKellar Group and Rainy Day Books.\n \n Grisham discussed his recent nonfiction book, The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town.This chronicled the Oklahoma case that resulted in the wrongful convictions of former minor-league baseball player Ron Williamson who was sentenced to die. Ron died of cirrhosis in December 2004, five years after being freed.\n \n Thursday in an interview with The Kansas City Star, author John Grisham said the death penalty in the United States should be \"abolished forever\". He also said it is his personal view that the death penalty is immoral. Grisham realizes that the most powerful argument against the death penalty is that it kills the innocent as well as the guilty, a case that he makes simply by telling Williamson and Fritz's story. He also discussed Ron Williamson's friend Dennis Fritz. Dennis Fritz got life in prison. Both were exonerated after spending years in prison.\n \n Dennis Fritz also works with the Innocence Project in Kansas City, Missouri. He makes appearances related to \"the innocence movement\" nationwide. He is using a book he recently published, \"Journey Toward Justice\", as a vehicle to bring awareness of the overall, devastating effects of how false convictions can destroy people's lives and how mistakes can be made in cases. He travels the United States speaking to law schools and also hopes to reach prosecutors and judges.\n \n Here is what Barry Scheck from The Innocence Project says about Dennis Fritz's book Journey Toward Justice:\n There have been one hundred eighty-one post-conviction DNA exonerations in America. The exonerated and their families are the heart and soul of this movement. There is no more decent and dignified a man, nor a more gentle soul, than Dennis Fritz. He has had the fortitude to tell his whole story. As always, I am in awe of his courage and humbled by his efforts.- Barry C. Scheck The Innocence Project\n From Barbara's Journey Toward Justice Blog",

   "Barry Shreck is the piece of lard that helped O.J. Simpson go free. No innocent man there.\n\n \n However he played a minor role if you recall. He provided some cross examination of experts in DNA. The prosecution defended itself well against that route for raising doubt. What turned the trick with the jury was the stupid demonstration with the glove that the prosecution insisted on doing even if they did not have a clue as to what the result would be - that was the disaster - poor performance by the prosecution which resulted in reasonable doubt. The DNA evidence was convincing, but all it takes is reasonable doubt from any source! That was not Scrhecks contribution. And bear in mind that the defense is entitled to mount the best defense its capable of (indeed required ethically to do so).",

   "BTW, I'm a white guy, and I believe not only that OJ was Not Guilty, but also that he was Innocent.\n\n \n Well I am a white guy who gives expert testimony on forensic chemistry from time to time (for the defense generally) and I believe that OJ is as guilty as he can be. On the other hand the jury gets to make that decision not you or I and the prosecution failed miserably in the case. Darden should have been taken out and shot so to speak for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.",
