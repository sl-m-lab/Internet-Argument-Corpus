   "WENATCHEE, Wash. - A judge Monday upheld Democrat Christine Gregoire's victory in the closest race for governor in U.S. history, rejecting Republican claims that last fall's election was stolen through errors and fraud. \n \n The election - decided by an amazingly close 129 votes out of 2.9 million cast - included 1,678 illegally cast ballots, Chelan County Superior Court Judge John Bridges found. But he said Republicans failed to prove that GOP candidate Dino Rossi would have won if those votes had been disregarded.\n \n \"Unless an election is clearly invalid, when the people have spoken their verdict should not be disturbed by the courts,\" Bridges said. Nullifying the election, he said, would be \"the ultimate act of judicial egotism and judicial activism.\"\n \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050606/ap_on_el_gu/election_challenge;_ylt=AuEyM3cdVw.5Z39tNSFOvK6s0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2MTQ3MTFjBHNlYwN0cw--",
