   "Yeah, ok, I see your point. Let's blame the US, Israel, and the UK among others, for the bombs going off and many innocent citizens killed. Lets try to forgive the terrorists who are actually planning the attacks, building the bombs, putting them on trains, and detonating them. After all, they were provoked for 80+ years now. Surely it is in our value system to feel sorry for them and simply accept that they will have to kill a few thousand of us infidels in order to pay the debt of the past 80 years. \n \n Come to think of it, I had a great idea. Why don't we start organizing groups of volunteers to get on buses, and let terrorists blow them up with impunity. I bet I could find many people, perhaps some even right here on this forum, who feel that they share the blame for the past 80 years, and are willing to give their lives in charity to prevent the deaths of \"innocent\" people. Perhaps if a few thousand of us volunteer to let the terrorists kill us, they will get it over with and leave us alone, right? \n \n Even better, in conjunction, we can work to assure that the terrorists are never a threat again. We can pull all of our troops out of the middle east, stop nuclear monitoring of the middle east, withdrawl all support for those infidel Israeli's and let the muslims simply \"dispose\" of the jews, and even stop using sattelites to spy on terrorists and their activities. Why don't we even offer to rebuild those nice camps in the desert that they all like to vacation at. In the meantime, we can let Saddam out of jail, and allow him to return to his rightful place of power in Iraq, so he can continue to deal with those insolent Iraqi's the way his law and religion tell him to without our interference (raping women, falsely imprisoning people, indiscriminately killing people without cause, and gassing minority fringes of the population). After all, the western ideals that all humans should have the right to live without fear of death by gassing regardless of race or religion only show why we are truely infidels, and thus deserving of death in the first place. \n \n (no sarcasm was used in the writing of this post, nor implied or intended.)",
