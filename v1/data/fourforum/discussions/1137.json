   "What is an important skill for test taking? \n \n Even though I am older, I tutor students every week. One of the things I tutor is test taking. I would like to hear from students what works for them and what does not work. I can also answer questions concerning these skills.\n \n Have at it.\n\n \n I guess I have been a professional student since high school, as I have BSN, became a certified paramedic, and then a pilot. I was a poor student in high school for many reasons, number one was probably not knowing how and when to study. But test taking was also one of my worst areas. I found that the best thing for me to do is to read the questions 2 or 3 times, as I have found that it helps me to understand what the question is really asking, and make sure that I have not misread it. Also, for me, it is important to relax before a test. I do not study the day of a test because I feel that if I don't know it by the time I get up that morning, no amount of cramming is going to help. The most important part of taking a test is being prepared properly. I study a little each day, and believe it or not, I don't take notes in class. Taking notes makes me focus on my notebook, and I miss most of what the instructor is trying to say. I get more out of a class by listening to the instructor, and getting involved in the discussion. This turned me around from a B and C student in high school to a 3.8 in college, 2nd in my paramedic class out of 32, and 1st in flight school. They worked for me, but they might not work for others. I think it is different for everyone, and you just have to find what works for you.",

   "For single-answer questions,\n \n I just read the question....I don't even read any possible answers (for matching, multiple choice, etc.) As I read the question, I write down any possible answers that come into my head. (because usually the first thing to come to mind is right). Then, I look at the possible answers (if they exist), and eliminate any of the ones that aren't on there. Then, I look at what answers I have remaining (which, many times, is only one) and attempt to determine which one is correct.\n \n For paragraph/essay questions,\n \n I do the same thing, except I obviously don't eliminate to try to reduce it down to one answer. In this case, I look at what I have down to make sure it is all correct, and then I group them, which then make the main points for my answer.\n \n It obviously worked for me (I had a 3.95 HS GPA and a 34 ACT). \n \n However, I don't think there is one method that will help anyone. It is a matter of what will work for each individual person. I took a class to prepare for the ACT at my HS. They taught the \"take the test 3 times method\" where you go through and answer all the ones you know first, then you go back through and answer the ones you think you know, and then you go back again and guess on the ones you don't already know. I found that method only increased my errors (such as putting answers on the wrong numbers) and wasted my time.\n \n I think the best thing for you to do would be to gather as many different test-taking strategies as you can and then present them to the student and let the student decide which one he/she feels will work the best.",

   "Well, I am not hearing much. Here are a few hints for those who want ot improve their grades.\n \n 1) Spend thirty minutes five days each week practicing taking tests.\n \n Tests don't ask you just to read your text. So why, when you study is that all you do. Tests ask you to answer questions. The best method for practicing test taking is to test youself multiple times over on the material. If you do that, I guarantee at least a change in your grades by one letter grade, unless you already make A;'s then your A's will be higher. \n \n Ask yourself questions and write answers. Use the questions that your text books provide. See if you get old tests from students that have already had the class and use those to practice. Not cheating as most teachers won't use the same test two classes in a row.",
