These people are now paying a mortgage for a house that's only worth half of what they bought it for. And if they have ARMs that are about to reset, then they should seriously consider killing themselves.\n \n And to think the bursting of the bubble has just started.\n By the time this is over, housing prices will have dropped more than during the Great Depression.\n \n But oh well, it's not like they weren't warned many times over.",

What we are seeing right now is just a minor correction that is being caused by the disturbances in the credit market. All that will work itself out soon and everything will be peachy again.\n \n \n ROTFLMAO. People are so stupid.....",

   "I've written synopsis on shows like that.\n \n Problem with housing I can foresee is that once the baby-boomer bubble pops with their retirements and eventual deaths, the population will decline somewhat...meaning their houses won't be as needed.\n So, unless we allow immigrants in to make up the lost numbers or start rapidly breeding ourselves, house value will decline as no one will need the excess.\n \n Tearing them down for other developments might not be needed either for the same reason, lack of population to support them.\n \n If ecological decline continues, some areas may not be as desirable too.\n \n As to the stories, some of those home buyers got the loans to build the homes before they were even built...and IIRC, yep many had gimmiky loans (ARMs) to help them thinking they'd resell or refinance later.",
