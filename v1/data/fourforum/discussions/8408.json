It is governing in spite of them. \n \n Is there really any doubt in your mind that as written and ratified, EVERYBODY is supposed to have the right to a trial? Is there really any doubt in your mind that as written and ratified, everybody is supposed to be safe from TORTURE by the US government? Do you really believe for even one second that our government was actually supposed to be able to split hairs over things like waterboarding? Do you really believe that as written and ratified the federal government was supposed to be able to supercede the state of california, overturning a popular measure passed by voters to allow private citizens to cultivate marajuana for their private use? \n \n HELL NO. \n \n Admittedly there have been some clever manipualtions and creative decpetions over the past couple hundred years in order to transform what was described by several newspapers at the time as \"A simple document that can fit in a mans pocket that even a simpleton can fully understand\" into a supposedly complex piece of work that you must spend millions of dollars on a trip to the supreme court in order to have interpeted. \n \n This seems largely to be the result of a shift in paradigm in our judicial brach following WWII. Prior to WWII, judicial conventional wisdom was that in all matters, events and arguments must be viewed in the light most favorable to the citizen. The courts were largely seen, even by those in government, as at best a fair arbitrator between the government and its people and more likely as an ally to the citizen against the government. The primary mission of the courts was largely viewed as protectign the rights of the citizen. Following WWII, the paradigm shifted and the courts primary mission seemed to be preserving the power of the government.",

Just read an opinion by one. \"the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\"\n \n That is a quote used by these people.\n\n \n Absolutly. Starting roughly following WWII, a legal theory came about that the constitution should be viewed as a livign document, that is, interpetations should be based with greater weight given to the current circumstances than to the original intent or even the wording of the document. \n \n In the years prior to this, there had been a LOT of constitutional ammendments proposed and shot down covering everythign form the Right to bear arms to the right to a trial to voting rights. Essentially, those ammendments were all defeated so a VERY SPECIFIC group essentially decided that if they could not change the constitution, they would try to change the way the constitution was interpeted, and you started to see a major push towards a \"living\" constitutional interpetation.\n \n The problem with a living constitution is that once you decide that the letter and spirit of the document no longer matter, it becomes infinitely flexible and you are essentially living under a condition of pseudo constitutional government as opposed to actually having a constitutional government. \n \n Do you REALLY THINK that those who drafted or ratified our constituion would agree with the idea of having \"protest zones\" surrounded by barbed wire miles away from the event being protested? Hell no. They woudl have started a civil war at the very suggestion. Do you REALLY THINK that the folks who wrote the second ammendment and ratified it, folks who wrote thousands fo pages on the importance of having a citizenry where every man was equipped with military weapons in order to defend himself, his family, and his country against foreign invaders or a tyrannical government, woudl agree with arguing over whether or not we can own guns that are black and have bayonette mounts on them? HELL NO. the revolutionary war was started because the british tried to seize the privatly owned arms at lexington and concorde.\n \n BUT, if you adopt a living constitution stance, this does not matter becuase youc an simply shrug and say \"times have changed\". Yes, they have, constitutional government has been destroyed at that point.",
