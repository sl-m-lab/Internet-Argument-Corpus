For Christ sake even the APA and AMA are against this!!\n\n \n I have pointed this out before, but there seems to be two things going on in the 'ex-gay' movement (there needs to be a better name for it)--one indeed is sometimes the 'reparative therapy' thing. Though this seems to be getting more rare.

These sites, like PFOX, seem to be more oriented toward providing support for that, and I don't see why that should be a problem. IMO, these are two very different focuses that should be debated differently.

Not everyone wants to be out and proud or even indulge in gay relationships.\n\n \n Nope your right. They believe the lies, the hate, the distortion, and find themselves wallowing in despair and will try ANYTHING to measure up to the stereotypes and standards heterosexual society has imposed on them...\n \n BTW: Box Turtle Bulletin APA Passes Resolution Against Ex-Gay Therapy, Finds &#8220;No Evidence&#8221; Change Therapy Works\n \n APA Passes Resolution Against Ex-Gay Therapy, Finds \"No Evidence\" Change Therapy Works\n Jim Burroway\n August 5th, 2009\n \n The American Psychological Association, meeting at their annual conference in Toronto, adopted a resolution today calling on mental health professionals to stop telling clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or other treatments. And in a direct challenge to NARTH and Exodus International, the resolution further calls on patients, guardians, families and other clients to avoid conversion therapy programs which portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder. Tha APA advises instead that people who are troubled by their sexual orientation should seek therapy, social support and educational services \"that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth.\"\n \n The resolution, approved today by the APA's governing Council of Representatives, is the result of a comprehensive 130-page study by the APA's Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation. That study looked at all peer-reviewed, English language studies published in the professional literature since 1960, and determined that:\n \n There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not recent SOCE (Sexual Orientation Change Efforts) do or do not work to change a person's sexual orientation. Scientifically rigorous older work in this area ... found that sexual orientation (i.e., erotic attractions and sexual arousal oriented to one sex or the other, or both) was unlikely to change due to efforts designed for this purpose. Some individuals appeared to learn how to ignore or limit their attractions. However, this was much less likely to be true for people whose sexual attractions were initially limited to people of the same sex.\n \n The Task Force noted that some studies indicated that patients were able to change their identity, but that is the easy part. Simply saying \"I'm not gay\" is far different from actually changing sexual orientation:\n \n Although there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation, some individuals modified their sexual orientation identity (i.e., group membership and affiliation), behavior, and values (Nicolosi et al., 2000). They did so in a variety of ways and with varied and npredictable outcomes, some of which were temporary (Beckstead & Morrow, 2004; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002). Based on the available data, additional claims about the meaning of those outcomes are scientifically unsupported.\n \n The complete resolution is attached at the end of this post. It is also available on the APA's web site, along with the full report and press release.\n \n I'm only about a quarter of the way through the APA's accompanying 130-page review, but I'm very impressed with what I see so far. Unlike NARTH's so-called study, the APA took a very disciplined approach in determining what studies to look at. They began be establishing clear standards to determine what studies to include in their review (all peer-reviewed English-language studies published since 1960), which is very unlike NARTH's approach, which was to ignore studies and obfuscate data that didn't fit the message they wanted to present. And unlike the APA's report, NARTH relied heavily on references which were not peer-reviewed, including pop-psychology books from the 1960s and 1970s which promoted such fads as \"primal scream\" therapy and advising readers on how to \"be your own best friend.\"\n \n The latest APA resolution does not ban conversion therapy outright - it doesn't say, for example, \"from here on and henceforth no therapist shall perform SOCE - but given the resolution's comprehensive conclusions, it's hard to see how conversion therapy as currently practiced by NARTH and other major ex-gay organizations can continue to be regarded as ethical or acceptable. These points appear to be particularly relevant to change efforts overall:\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others' sexual orientation;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation;\n \n And this one, which is especially relevant to NARTH, Exodus International, and other anti-gay organizations pushing change therapies:\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association opposes the distortion and selective use of scientific data about homosexuality by individuals and organizations seeking to influence public policy and public opinion and will take a leadership role in responding to such distortions;\n \n The resolution also recognizes that:\n \n Those operating from religious/spiritual traditions are encouraged to recognize that it is outside their role and expertise to adjudicate empirical scientific issues in psychology, while also recognizing they can appropriately speak to theological implications of psychological science\n \n With this resolution, it now appears that NARTH, Exodus International, Courage, Evergreen International, and other groups are now firmly outside the accepted practices of the APA. I expect that their reaction will be just what we've seen before: \"the distortion and selective use of scientific data about homosexuality by individuals and organizations seeking to influence public policy and public opinion.\"\n \n A Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts\n \n Research Summary\n The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality per se is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation (Bell, Weinberg & Hammersmith, 1981; Bullough, 1976; Ford & Beach 1951; Kinsey, Pomeroy, & Martin, 1948; Kinsey, Pomeroy, Martin, & Gebhard, 1953). Homosexuality per se is not a mental disorder (APA, 1975). Since 1974, the American Psychological Association (APA) has opposed stigma, prejudice, discrimination, and violence on the basis of sexual orientation and has taken a leadership role in supporting the equal rights of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals (APA, 2005).\n \n APA is concerned about ongoing efforts to mischaracterize homosexuality and promote the notion that sexual orientation can be changed and about the resurgence of sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE). SOCE has been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some faith based organizations, on the one hand, and those held by lesbian, gay, and bisexual rights organizations and professional and scientific organizations, on the other (Drescher, 2003; Drescher & Zucker, 2006).\n \n Some individuals and groups have promoted the idea of homosexuality as symptomatic of developmental defects or spiritual and moral failings and have argued that SOCE, including psychotherapy and religious efforts, could alter homosexual feelings and behaviors (Drescher & Zucker, 2006; Morrow & Beckstead, 2004). Many of these individuals and groups appeared to be embedded within the larger context of conservative religious political movements that have supported the stigmatization of homosexuality on political or religious grounds (Drescher, 2003; Drescher & Zucker, 2006; Southern Poverty Law Center, 2005). Psychology, as a science, and various faith traditions, as theological systems, can acknowledge and respect their profoundly different methodological and philosophical viewpoints. The APA concludes that psychology must rely on proven methods of scientific inquiry based on empirical data, on which hypotheses and propositions are confirmed or disconfirmed, as the basis to explore and understand human behavior (APA, 2008a; 2008c). In response to these concerns, APA appointed the Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation to review the available research on SOCE and to provide recommendations to the association. The task force reached the following findings.\n \n Recent studies of participants in SOCE identify a population of individuals who experience serious distress related to same sex sexual attractions. Most of these participants are Caucasian males who report that their religion is extremely important to them (Beckstead & Morrow, 2004; Nicolosi, Byrd, & Potts, 2000; Schaeffer, Hyde, Kroencke, McCormick, & Nottebaum, 2000; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002, Spitzer, 2003). These individuals report having pursued a variety of religious and secular efforts intended to help them change their sexual orientation. To date, the research has not fully addressed age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, disability, language, and socioeconomic status in the population of distressed individuals. There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not recent SOCE do or do not work to change a person's sexual orientation. Scientifically rigorous older work in this area (e.g., Birk, Huddleston, Miller, & Cohler, 1971; James, 1978; McConaghy, 1969, 1976; McConaghy, Proctor, & Barr, 1972; Tanner, 1974, 1975) found that sexual orientation (i.e., erotic attractions and sexual arousal oriented to one sex or the other, or both) was unlikely to change due to efforts designed for this purpose. Some individuals appeared to learn how to ignore or limit their attractions. However, this was much less likely to be true for people whose sexual attractions were initially limited to people of the same sex.\n \n Although sound data on the safety of SOCE are extremely limited, some individuals reported being harmed by SOCE. Distress and depression were exacerbated. Belief in the hope of sexual orientation change followed by the failure of the treatment was identified as a significant cause of distress and negative self-image (Beckstead & Morrow, 2004; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002).\n \n Although there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation, some individuals modified their sexual orientation identity (i.e., group membership and affiliation), behavior, and values (Nicolosi et al., 2000). They did so in a variety of ways and with varied and unpredictable outcomes, some of which were temporary (Beckstead & Morrow, 2004; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002). Based on the available data, additional claims about the meaning of those outcomes are scientifically unsupported.\n \n On the basis of the task force's findings, the APA encourages mental health professionals to provide assistance to those who seek sexual orientation change by utilizing affirmative multiculturally competent (Bartoli & Gillem, 2008; Brown, 2006) and clientcentered approaches (e.g., Beckstead & Israel, 2007; Glassgold, 2008; Haldeman, 2004; Lasser & Gottlieb, 2004) that recognize the negative impact of social stigma on sexual minorities (Herek, 2009; Herek & Garnets, 2007) and balance ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence, justice, and respect for people's rights and dignity (APA, 1998, 2002; Davison, 1976; Haldeman, 2002; Schneider, Brown, & Glassgold, 2002).\n \n Resolution\n \n WHEREAS, The American Psychological Association expressly opposes prejudice (defined broadly) and discrimination based on age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, or socioeconomic status (APA, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008c);\n \n WHEREAS, The American Psychological Association takes a leadership role in opposing prejudice and discrimination (APA, 2008b, 2008c), including prejudice based on or derived from religion or spirituality, and encourages commensurate consideration of religion and spirituality as diversity variables (APA, 2008c);\n \n WHEREAS, Psychologists respect human diversity including age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, and socioeconomic status (APA, 2002) and psychologists strive to prevent bias from their own spiritual, religious, or non-religious beliefs from taking precedence over professional practice and standards or scientific findings in their work as psychologists (APA, 2008c);\n \n WHEREAS, Psychologists are encouraged to recognize that it is outside the role and expertise of psychologists, as psychologists, to adjudicate religious or spiritual tenets, while also recognizing that psychologists can appropriately speak to the psychological implications of religious/spiritual beliefs or practices when relevant psychological findings about those implications exist (APA, 2008b);\n \n WHEREAS, Those operating from religious/spiritual traditions are encouraged to recognize that it is outside their role and expertise to adjudicate empirical scientific issues in psychology, while also recognizing they can appropriately speak to theological implications of psychological science (APA, 2008b);\n \n WHEREAS, The American Psychological Association encourages collaborative activities in pursuit of shared prosocial goals between psychologists and religious communities when such collaboration can be done in a mutually respectful manner that is consistent with psychologists' professional and scientific roles (APA, 2008b);\n \n WHEREAS, Societal ignorance and prejudice about a same-sex sexual orientation places some sexual minorities 2 at risk for seeking sexual orientation change due to personal, family, or religious conflicts, or lack of information (Beckstead & Morrow, 2004; Haldeman, 1994; Ponticelli, 1999; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002; Wolkomir, 2001);\n \n WHEREAS, Some mental health professionals advocate treatments based on the premise that homosexuality is a mental disorder (e.g., Nicolosi, 1991; Socarides, 1968);\n \n WHEREAS, Sexual minority children and youth are especially vulnerable populations with unique developmental tasks (Perrin, 2002; Ryan & Futterman, 1997), who lack adequate legal protection from involuntary or coercive treatment (Arriola, 1998; Burack & Josephson, 2005; Molnar, 1997) and whose parents and guardians need accurate information to make informed decisions regarding their development and well-being (Cianciotto & Cahill, 2006; Ryan & Futterman, 1997); and\n \n WHEREAS, Research has shown that family rejection is a predictor of negative outcomes (Remafedi, Farrow, & Deisher, 1991; Ryan, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2009; Savin-Williams, 1994; Wilber, Ryan, & Marksamer, 2006) and that parental acceptance and school support are protective factors (D'Augelli, 2003; D'Augelli, Hershberger & Pilkington, 1998; Goodenow, Szalacha, & Westheimer, 2006; Savin-Williams, 1989) for sexual minority youth;\n \n THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association affirms that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality regardless of sexual orientation identity;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association reaffirms its position that homosexuality per se is not a mental disorder and opposes portrayals of sexual minority youths and adults as mentally ill due to their sexual orientation;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others' sexual orientation;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association concludes that the emerging knowledge on affirmative multiculturally competent treatment provides a foundation for an appropriate evidence-based practice with children, adolescents and adults who are distressed by or seek to change their sexual orientation (Bartoli & Gillem, 2008; Brown, 2006; Martell, Safren & Prince, 2004; Ryan & Futterman, 1997; Norcross, 2002);\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association advises parents, guardians, young people, and their families to avoid sexual orientation change efforts that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and to seek psychotherapy, social support and educational services that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association encourages practitioners to consider the ethical concerns outlined in the 1997 APA Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Response to Sexual Orientation (American Psychological Association, 1998), in particular the following standards and principles: scientific bases for professional judgments, benefit and harm, justice, and respect for people's rights and dignity;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association encourages practitioners to be aware that age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, disability, language, and socioeconomic status may interact with sexual stigma, and contribute to variations in sexual orientation identity development, expression, and experience;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association opposes the distortion and selective use of scientific data about homosexuality by individuals and organizations seeking to influence public policy and public opinion and will take a leadership role in responding to such distortions;\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association supports the dissemination of accurate scientific and professional information about sexual orientation in order to counteract bias that is based in lack of knowledge about sexual orientation; and\n \n BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Psychological Association encourages advocacy groups, elected officials, mental health professionals, policy makers, religious professionals and organizations, and other organizations to seek areas of collaboration that may promote the wellbeing of sexual minorities.",

   "Then they should be given plenty of emotional support in making that decision to help them not be suicidal. We need to be careful here and not conflate a clinical problem (depression and suicidal thoughts) with a behavioral issue.\n \n \n \n IMO, the issue that outside people hate people different from themselves shouldn't be a deciding factor if someone wants to live counter to SSA. If someone wants to live that way, then they should be supported in doing that--it's their decision and that's what ultimately matters. Just as you would support a decision for a person to be 'out and proud.'\n \n \n \n People have freedom of choice. People like Jason chose to be out and embrace the SSA thing, while others choose a different path.\n \n \n \n That may be, but it's no different than claiming the demand for gays to be out perpetuates the idea they should be out and proud. These are simply matters of opinion.\n \n \n \n The give full citation for this, and it's from a reputable source.\n \n \n \n That is clearly presented as an op-ed piece.\n\n \n I agree. If someone is confused about their sexuality we should be giving them emotional support. Not lying to them and telling them they can and should change their sexual orientation.\n \n I would agree that if someone wants to ignore their true feelings towards homosexuality then they should be able too. However I will stress that I dont think we should be lying to them.\n \n People do have the freedom of choice. But taking advantage of someone who is confused about their sexuality or has some dispute about it and then telling them they should be straight and they can be straight is forcing their sexuality on them.\n \n The main difference between perpetuating the idea that homosexuality should be changed and that homosexuals should be out of the closet is that by perpetuation the idea that homosexuality should be changed you are perpetuation the idea that it is wrong and in turn causes violence against gay people.\n \n They certainly did. Here it is.\n Risk Factors for Attempted Suicide in Gay and Bisexual Youth -- Remafedi et al. 87 (6): 869 -- Pediatrics\n \n PFOX claimed this: Suicide attempts were not explained by experiences with discrimination, violence, loss of friendship, or current personal attitudes towards homosexuality.\n \n Unless I am missing something the source they used never claimed this.\n \n Yes it is an opinion piece.

   "Sometimes? Jyoshu this entire \"movement\" is based upon fallacy and stupidity! You cannot change a persons sexuality no matter how hard you try...\n\n \n That's only the 'reparative therapy' thing. I'm talking about the part of the movement that provides support for people struggling with SSA. Since the 'change' thing is what you're arguing against, are we to assume you'd be fine with the movement as long as they don't try to physiologically and psychologically change peoples' orientation? I hope you realize that the movement is much larger than that. PFOX is a good example.\n \n \nPlease.... More tripe and bull from the religious brigade... Moralistically \"Christian\"... So basically conform to our beliefs or we hate you, stone you, and brand you like the rest of the other heathens right?\n\n \n Most church groups demonstrate far less intolerance and 'hate' than the gay pride movement itself. At least these church groups are reaching out and supporting these people who are religious rather than your movement's way of only giving them help if they take the 'out and proud' approach with their lives. I have YET to see an organization in your movement that states it supports these gays who DON'T want to live as a gay person. Erog, it's your approach that's being conditional here.\n \n \nThen why even have the debate then? Are you just trying to avoid the whole issue or only part you know you cannot justify because it's painfully obvious your in the wrong...\n\n \n Because the 'reparative therapy' thing is only one part of it, and an older approach at that.\n \n \nCounter??? Jyoshu either your really ignorant, or you really are a manipulator of words... I am GAY. It took myself much pain and anguish to deal with who I am deep down and to rise above the stigma and bull that people like PFOX try to guilt into gays...\n\n \n Personally, I think you're being WAAAAY over-sensitive when you read support for religious people as trying to induce guilt into gays ...\n heck, again, PFOX even states they support gays (not just ex-gays, but gays.) Stop trying to pretend this isn't about the fact you don't like their support of people who are living a different way that the way you think they should, ideologically. Because if you're REALLY for people being able to live their lives they way THEY want, you should be supporting such organizations as PFOX rather than condemning them. It's a big world Jason, and believe it or not some people choose not live in a homosexual way even though they may be gay.\n \n \nWrong. Your INTERPRETATION of the Bible is what you base off of it. YOUR opinion.\n\n \n Except, my interpretation is based on something that is a lot more cut and dry than what you read into it. I suppose even if a book says \"the sky is blue\" you can always still say 'but that's not what it REALLY means; even though it said the sky is blue, it really means something else!\" Sorry, but at some point, it's best to just acknowledge what something is obviously stating than to wish it were something different. The Bible clearly indicates gay sex is not ok. Now, you can disagree with it's stance on that if you want, but don't pretend a spade is not a spade. Disagree if you want and let the chips fall where they may, but it's clear on this.\n \n \nPLEASE..... Are you and Easy roommates or something?\n\n \n I certainly don't agree with EZ or pretty much anyone here on everything. Where EZ is right, IMO, I unapologetically will argue along the same lines as he may. I'm not going to avoid arguing a similar stance on a given issue just because you and many others here don't like EZ. For instance, if EZ says \"I believe people should not burglarize other peoples' homes\", why shouldn't I agree with that? There are things you and I may agree on as well--and things we don't. That's the beauty of a discussion forum like this. Lots of viewpoints.\n \n \nNo Jyoshu it's because they have been indoctrinated since they were young.. They have grown up in a fierce masculine, heterosexual society that deems them to be outcasts, outsiders, and sub human.\n\n \n There is a reason society is mostly heterosexual--it's because that's the norm, quite frankly, and by far most people aren't homosexual. What would you expect when procreation is such a big part of human life and experience? That doesn't mean you're \"sub human\". It just means most of society is different regarding this issue. That's just reality; nothing 'fierce' about it.\n \n \nYou actually thinking that these people can get \"help\"!! They CANT either they will die of suicide, live bitter double lives, or just flat out be another sad statistic of drug and alcohol use because they cannot cope with their sexuality...\n\n \n So you actually think all those testimonials are just out and out lies? Every one of them??? Do you not see how you're making a judgment on THEIR lives based on YOUR experience? Why should they not know better about their lives than you? Why should we assume you know better about their lives than they?\n \n \nBTW: Box Turtle Bulletin APA Passes Resolution Against Ex-Gay Therapy, Finds &#8220;No Evidence&#8221; Change Therapy Works\n\n \n Again, that only addresses the therapy/change thing, not the religious support part of it. And it doesn't take into account the political ties the APA has had with liberal groups, historically. (which have been commented on and shown on these forums on multiple occasions, as I recall.)",

   "What part is that? And anyways even then its still not good. There is nothing wrong with homosexuality.\n\n \n Well that's where we just have to agree to disagree. Religiously, I don't agree with you on that. You have your right to your views of course, as I do to mine. I think yours are out of the mainstream (given what we've seen in recent years on ballot initiatives), but that's your prerogative, of course.\n \n \nThose people struggling with their sexuality need someone to talk to that is not biased and trying to tell them that they should stop having same sex relationships. They should just be there to help them.\n\n \n The issue of gay relationships is largely a moralistic issue in society. IOW, I think it is unreasonable to expect anyone to turn their back on their moralistic stance and check their beliefs at the door. I think it's just fine to provide love and support and yet still not abandon one's principles that gay relationships are wrong. We all have our lines in the sand, and, knowing we're all going to have areas of disagreement, that's ok. Where you and I can agree is that parents and friends should love gay people unconditionally. That's not the same thing as saying the parent or friend has to completely agree with their actions. I think the reason for suicides and so forth isn't because people disagree with gay sex or relationships, but rather because hateful people have too often taken it too far and gone BEYOND just disagreement. \n IOW ...a.) It should be ok to disagree or say \"I think your actions are wrong; let me help you avoid doing that\". \n b.)It's not ok to kick gay kids out on the street or deride and insult them. And the former does not mean the latter.\n The answer shouldn't have to be for society to just do a moralistic sea change and suddenly pretend they are moralistically ok with same-gender sex. Support and love doesn't have to mean abandoning one's principles.\n \n \nNo they arnt compassionate because they arnt. They arnt there to help people they are there to make them do what they want.\n\n \n What would be their motive for doing that?? It just doesn't pass the smell test. It's not like a non-profit is a ticket to getting rich! \n \n \nAnd my movement condemns religious views? What exactly is my movement? \n\n \n You clearly argue on the side of the gay pride movement.\n \n \nHow exactly is the gay pride movement preying upon people who are vulnerable?\n\n \n Have you not read some of the horrible things that have been said on this website about Rekers? I'd say that's not exactly love and support for a gay person at all!",

This is my view I'm arguing from, here. There's no twisting to it.\n \n \n1. Not understanding why sexual orientation comes about is irrelevant to the fact that it exists, and trying to change is ineffective and often harmful.\n\n \n It is relevant because it shows this is not a well-understood issue overall, and to take such a determined stand as you are doing as if it IS demonstrates the problematic nature of what you are arguing. \n \n \n2.

The problem is no one would ever want to be an ex-gay if they weren't told by others that it is bad.\n\n \n Bingo.\n And that is the real crux of the problem--the gay pride movement doesn't want anyone having a moral issue with their actions.

Homosexuals can live normal, happy lives.\n\n \n With all due respect, science can't nor should address morality (which is a philosophical matter). Yes, science can indicate that gays can live 'normal, happy lives.' (Though what's 'normal' depends greatly on social standards, but we need not get into that necessarily.) Science can't speak to what's 'bad' and 'evil'. It can only say what it observes, not matters of philosophical nature. \n \n \nI dare you to answer this question.

Lucky for them they don't have to deal with an electricity-rights movement constantly berating them for wanting to live differently like ex-gays do. PFOX exists to support people who want to make the choice of not living the way the gay rights movement says people are supposed to live. \n \n \nThere are mountains of old home remedies and old wives tales about how to treat/prevent illness - does not mean they are correct. Just because a pile of yahoos swear by Uncle Walt's Snake Oil Juice, does not mean it is legitimate medicine.\n\n \n Again, if you found one of them DID work for you, why would you not share that, snake oil or otherwise?",

   "Please.\n This idea out there that somehow becoming a scientist or a \"trained medical professional\" miraculously makes someone completely objective and rational and above ideology and politics is ludicrous. \n\n \n Nothing touched by human hands can be completely objective. However, legitimate scientists and doctors are better qualified to judgments about mental health issues than a gaggle of Bible thumpers who have exactly zero credible qualifications.\n \n \nGroups like the AMA and APA go through cycles and phases if you look at them over the historical long-term. The fact that they once went too far the OTHER way and considered homosexuality a mental illness should tell you something.\n\n \n Yes. That over time they allowed the evidence to prove their prejudices wrong.\n \n \nNot to mention the more recent movement toward try to accept pedophilia in a similar was as they currently view homosexuality.\n\n \n I suspect that a true pedophile can not change his/her orientation either. That does not mean that anyone supports legalizing the rape of children. \n \n \nA lot of it has to do with their religion too, which shouldn't have to be shelved if they don't want to.\n\n \n No it shouldn't - even if it leads them to misery. But hey - thats freedom. If they choose to live celibate lives or pretend to be straight, fine. That is a whole different animal from offering mental health services when you are not qualified to do so.\n \n \nIt may very well be more 'healthy' for Amish people to have electricity, but they choose not to.

PFOX exists to support people who want to make the choice of not living the way the gay rights movement says people are supposed to live. \n\n \n I fail to see how electricity makes one healthier. It makes life easier - - kinda like pretending to be straight when your not to appease a bunch of narrow minded schmucks.\n \n \nAgain, if you found one of them DID work for you, why would you not share that, snake oil or otherwise?\n\n \n No. For whatever it may seem to me, I am neither a doctor or chemist who has the qualifications to determine if said snake oil is actually a good thing. Hell, a couple of bottles of wine does a great job of mellowing out someone who is dealing with severe anxiety. Think we should advertise it as good medicine?\n \n I used to work in a mental health facility. Self-medicating was a common problem. There are reasons there are experts. If you don't think so, come talk to me the next time you have a tummy ache. I promise to at least be cheaper than your regular physician.",
