   "Not sure which section to put this in so I figured IQ, guy with chalk board, education.......\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/26/liberals.atheists.sex.intelligence/index.html\n \n \nLiberalism, atheism, male sexual exclusivity linked to IQ\n \n (CNN) -- Political, religious and sexual behaviors may be reflections of intelligence, a new study finds.\n \n Evolutionary psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa at the the London School of Economics and Political Science correlated data on these behaviors with IQ from a large national U.S. sample and found that, on average, people who identified as liberal and atheist had higher IQs. This applied also to sexual exclusivity in men, but not in women. The findings will be published in the March 2010 issue of Social Psychology Quarterly.\n \n The IQ differences, while statistically significant, are not stunning -- on the order of 6 to 11 points -- and the data should not be used to stereotype or make assumptions about people, experts say. But they show how certain patterns of identifying with particular ideologies develop, and how some people's behaviors come to be. \n\n \n \nBailey also said that these preferences may stem from a desire to show superiority or elitism, which also has to do with IQ. In fact, aligning oneself with \"unconventional\" philosophies such as liberalism or atheism may be \"ways to communicate to everyone that you're pretty smart,\" he said. \n\n \n \n\n Participants who said they were atheists had an average IQ of 103 in adolescence, while adults who said they were religious averaged 97, the study found. Atheism \"allows someone to move forward and speculate on life without any concern for the dogmatic structure of a religion,\" Bailey said. \n\n \n An interesting study since the IQ tests were taken as children while the conservative/liberal labels were derived after the children grew up. I have seen this about a dozen places and have not yet seen what definition they used for \"conservative\" and whether or not they took the persons word for it or had a series of questions to establish their conservative credentials. \n \n To me that would be critical because most intelligent people I know who are traditional conservatives no longer apply the conservative label to themselves, preferring to be identified as independents, libertarians, or TRADITIONAL conservatives, lest they be classed in with the mouth breathing Bush supporting XXXXXX who, as we have covered before, are typically more liberal in most of their stances than Bill Clinton.\n \n Thoughts???",

At one level social programs create a government power which is desirable by those seeking power (obviously) thus they tend to get bigger and include more. You don't want to get into a pattern with too few people in the workforce which drives up wages making jobs got to India thus putting more on the unemployment line. Really, here, we are talking about too many different things. You have SS, Medicare, and unemployment (which covers a lot I know). Unemployment/welfare benefits are generally limited and should be and a good conservative (good Scotsman fallacy!) would see this as a benefit to society but would also be ready to tear down the white house walls if it expanded. Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid are currently just not working out but not many solutions exist to fix this that are viable. I'm not even saying something close to these isn't needed...just that the current format is terrible.\n \n Point taken though. We need to get away from one level thought which looks like the below:\n Military = good = get more of it\n \n or on the democrat side of things\n \n poor people exist = give them money = no more poor people will exist\n \n Both are wrong.",

It began in 1978 with Prop 13:\n \nProposition 13 (officially titled the People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation) was an amendment of the Constitution of California enacted in 1978, by means of the initiative process. It was approved by California voters on June 6, 1978. It was upheld as constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1 (1992). Proposition 13 is embodied in Article 13A of the Constitution of the State of California.\n \n The most significant portion of the act is the first paragraph, which capped real estate taxes:\n \n \nSection 1. (a) The maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property shall not exceed One percent (1%) of the full cash value of such property. The one percent (1%) tax to be collected by the counties and apportioned according to law to the districts within the counties.\n\n \n The proposition's passage resulted in a cap on property tax rates in the state, reducing them by an average of 57%. In addition to lowering property taxes, the initiative also contained language requiring a two-thirds majority in both legislative houses for future increases in all state tax rates or amounts of revenue collected, including income tax rates. It also requires two-thirds vote majority in local elections for local governments wishing to raise special taxes. Proposition 13 received an enormous amount of publicity, not only in California, but throughout the United States.\n\n California Proposition 13 (1978) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Then, there was the Bush/Cheney Enron debacle which led to the election of Schwarzenegger, Republican, which appears not to have helped matters in California at all: \n \n \nEnron defrauded California out of billions during energy crisis\n By Jerry Isaacs\n 10 May 2002\n Documents released Monday by the Federal Energy Regulation Commission revealed Enron Corporation deliberately created real and imaginary shortages during the 2000-2001 California energy crisis, in order drive up prices and reap vast profits in the state's newly deregulated energy market.\n \n Internal memos from the now bankrupt company outline the various schemes Enron executives used to defraud officials running the state's power grid, manipulate energy supplies and literally loot the state treasury of billions of dollars. Throughout this period Enron enjoyed the closest political ties with the Bush White House, which rejected appeals from California officials for federal intervention and the imposition of price caps.\n\n Enron defrauded California out of billions during energy crisis\n \n Normally I would quibble with a purely socialist look at Enron's history but they pretty much are on the mark -- after all, I was around during that time and that's what really happened.",

   "If liberals really are all that much smarter, how come their political agendas do nothing more than ruin the country?\n \n After all look at Obama. He's a liberal and he's sunk our nation deeper into debt than we've ever been before in our entire existence. He just doesn't seem to understand that you can't spend your way out of a recession, the only way out is to save money and quit buying every damn thing that comes around.\n\n \n I had posted this a bit ago in the political forum for the same reason I do here now. An economy of the size of the US' is slow in changing direction, but can gain momentum quickly, like a runaway semi truck. The numbers below show a conservative party out of control. I don't agree with everything Obama is doing or the way he is doing it, but be honest he got handed one of the worst set of circumstances in history and has not gotten a lot of support trying to fix what the Republicans broke.\n \n \n\n US current reciepts... 2057.1T......... 2475.0T\n Personal Inc Tax ... 1309.6T......... 1421.7T\n Corp Inc Tax ... 1219.4T......... 1212.3T\n Current Expense ... 1871.9T......... 3117.6T\n Net Savings ... 185.2B......... -642.0B\n Net Borrowing ... 184.7B......... -785.1B\n Disposable Income ... 7.7B......... 3.9B\n \n So receipts increased, but not from businesses.

   "Your laughable talking-point riddled claim that Obama is \"a liberal\" merely proves the OP's point.\n\n \n Socialism is the final progression of modern liberalism and the antithesis of traditional liberalism.\n \n \nI should particularly like to take an intense look at California and how it was run into the ground by conservative extremists. It began in 1978 with Prop 13:\n \n California Proposition 13 (1978) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Then, there was the Bush/Cheney Enron debacle which led to the election of Schwarzenegger, Republican, which appears not to have helped matters in California at all: \n \n \n Enron defrauded California out of billions during energy crisis\n \n Normally I would quibble with a purely socialist look at Enron's history but they pretty much are on the mark -- after all, I was around during that time and that's what really happened.\n\n \n Ah, where to start with this Alice in Wonderland view of reality.\n First, California brought on their energy problems themselves. Thirty years of radical environmentalism prevented California from expanding their electricity production while demand grew by leaps and bounds.\n Your so-called deregulation wasn't deregulation. It created new rules and additional red tape. It forced utility companies to sell off their electricity generating equipment and buy electricity at market rates. Then it fixed the rates in California, making out-of-state sale preferrential. So CA wound up with fewer producers either selling to a low, fixed rate state customer or a more lucritive out-of-state market-driven market. \n \n \nObama inherited the bulk of that debt from Bush/Cheney.\n\n \n The author said \"he's sunk our nation deeper into debt than we've ever been before in our entire existence\". This is an accurate assessment. In his first year, Obama has increased our debt more than Bush did in many years in office.",

As an increase in Disposable income of less than 1% in 8 years is hardly what anyone would consider a succesful economic policy.\n \n I don't dispute we the people are going to pay for the short sightedness of our elected officials. My point was not to say that Obama has not increased debt, but to point out that Bush put him in a lousy position with few options. Comparing an economy that Bush was handed vs what Bush left it is obvious you just want to bash Obama because he is a democrat. \n \n The information I provided showed economic factors at the end of Clinton's term and the end of Bush's term. Bush walked into a manageable situation. By the end of his 1st year he took net lending/borrowing from +146B to -65B and to -422B the following and just to make things even better we went from -395B at the end of 2007 to -933B at the end of 2008. Net Government savings went from +226 to +24 to -306 by his second year and in 2007 was -214 only to skyrocket to -682 in 2008. \n \n I would not be surprised to find out Bush intentionally tanked the economy to leave Democrats to figure it out. It's perfect everybody remembers the good times under Bush, Obama catches the flak, Rep fight everything insisting things have to be done their way, but don't say what that way is.

   "No I am stating that there was an error in 1 part of the information I posted. The remaining information was and still is accurate. The correction doesn't have a negative effect on my statement. As an increase in Disposable income of less than 1% in 8 years is hardly what anyone would consider a successful economic policy.\nIt was 40%+ depending on what years you want to look at. ~$7,500 (2001) to ~$10,900 (2009). \n \n Futhermore, the president and congress aren't always the ones that determine this. You could have the best president ever and still have a recession. The thing is the president and congress can somewhat control the magnitude of these naturally occurring economic events. \n \n \nI don't dispute we the people are going to pay for the short sightedness of our elected officials. My point was not to say that Obama has not increased debt, but to point out that Bush put him in a lousy position with few options.\nAnd this is still misleading. Bush had some bad policies the democrats has had congress since 2006 and just continued the same bad polices of the last 15-20 years. It isn't as simple as Economy bad, Bush president, therefore Bush = bad economy. Same thing with Obama.\n \n This is why I say the numbers you and AA post are worthless. They tell us very little about Obama or Bush.\n \n To think the president can control the economy as much as some of you things think they can is scary.",

   "It is important to note that the numbers being used do not include our \"off balance sheet\" items (SS, medicare, etc....) or unfunded liabilities. \n \n Personally I think it is kind of XXXX how Obama has more or less gotten a pass on his spending. While I can agree that he was handed an unprecedented situation, his response to it has been decidedly poor and expensive. \n \n Democrats need to stop passing it off as \"fixing Bushs mess\". The economy is not Bushs mess. What we are seeing is the inescapable result building an economy on quicksand. IT is nasty, it is ugly, and it is FAR from over. We will look back on the last couple of years as the LEAD UP to the downturn. \n \n Republicans need to stop giving him a pass on his spending as well. A lot of republicans have been hesitant to do so because he has shoe horned a bunch of that spending into Bush programs and they dont want to give the impression that they are criticizing those programs that they once supported.\n \n Of course they did not make any sense and they were a bad idea when they supported them before, so they are certainly a bad idea now that they are even bigger, but partisan XXXX and the inability to admit a mistake is keeping most republicans out of it (and possibly the fact that they are all special interest whores and dont want to upset their pay masters who have largely been the beneficiaries of the largess).",
