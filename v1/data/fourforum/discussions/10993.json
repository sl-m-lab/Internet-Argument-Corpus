The hospital staff erred in denying the visits, especially those of the children. The denial of the partner's bedside visit is also deplorable. There is no legitimate reason to deny a peaceful visit from any friend or family member to the bedside of a dying person unless it would negatively affect the health and well being of either party. If it positively affects the health and well being of either of them, it should certainly be permitted.\n \n I think the hospital staff should be chastised and punished to the point of remembering this incident forever as a reason to relax their prejudices and get with the program.

Simple question, no gotcha waiting to pounce. :)\n\n \n This event actually very much underscores the need for it. Given the absence of a compassionate hospital or civil partnership rights, if the visiting partner had medical PoA or Durable PoA (which, from what I've seen, isn't very hard to do), then all visitation rights would have been guaranteed. I also doubt I've argued that a hospital shouldn't be required to be decent, or that 'visiting a lawyer' would mean one was 'all set' in every way.

If a hospital can do that, why should we assume that they would always obey documents with no actual law supporting them that go against the hospital's stated policies?\n\n \n Yes, a Medical PoA is a notarized legal document; my understanding is that a hospital is just as required to obey it as they would be marriage status, if not more so. If they didn't, the couple would have enormous recourse to sue, just as they could if a hospital disallowed visits by a married partner. I'm no lawyer, but I've researched that much, at least. Hospitals are very accustomed to documents like medical PoA and Guardianships. They are well aware of the legal implications of not honoring them.\n \n \nSo you haven't changed your opinion then, is that what you're (more or less) saying? You still think that seeing a lawyer and filling out some forms will, at least in this instance, provide the same protections that a full fledged marriage would give?\n\n \n Again, I doubt I've argued that \"seeing a lawyer and filling out some forms\" will provide all the same protections.
