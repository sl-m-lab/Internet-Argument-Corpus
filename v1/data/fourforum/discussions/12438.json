   "Chuz seems to have run out of answers, so...\n \n \nHow dare we voice our opinions regarding an unjust law which leads to the death of a million plus innocent babies per year in this country that translates into attempting to force our views on others Chuz. How quickly they forget how they are attempting to force their views on us by redefining every aspect of our social construct. But according to them, they aren't attempting to force their immoral values on us at all. The double standard and hypocrisy is striking.\n \n Prop 8 was a legally held ballot initiative according to the California Constitution, but according to iangb it was wrong because they lost and the majority spoke.\n\n So you are saying that me arguing with you on this forum would be comparable to you proposing and petitioning for new laws, by which people must abide or suffer the consequences? \n \n *sigh*\n \n I've said that I have no issue with you 'voicing your opinions', Archie. Hells, I've deliberately come to a place where all manner of people whom I might disagree with all 'voice their opinion', this is a debate forum here, yes? Voicing your opinion is not 'forcing your views on anyone else' - as Chuz has said, it's simply exercising the right to free speech. However, trying to get new laws to pass which only affect other people - such as Prop 8 or criminalising abortion - is forcing your morality onto others. Still, you've got the right to do just that - I'm not attempting to pass a law to stop you, or I would, indeed, be guilty of hypocrisy. I don't resent Prop 8 because it passed, just as I wouldn't resent a law banning abortion because it passed.\n That doesn't prevent me from resenting them for other reasons, and that doesn't prevent me from arguing against them, regardless of their current legal status.\n \n You seem to be confusing 'trying to pass a law which restricts choice' with 'arguing that choice should be maximised'.\n \n Chuz still ignored my main point - the 'forcing your morality' line was simply emphasis to the main argument. In an attempt to re-boot this (not sure why, seeing as I'm not online for the next week or so, but....) I'm gonna try and summarise where we are so far.\n \n Chuz thinks (please correct me if I'm wrong):\n 1. Human individuals possess 'inherent natural rights', inalienable apart from by due process.\n 2. An individuals rights commence at their biological starting point, as separate from their 'personhood' starting point.\n 3. A human individuals 'biological life' starts at conception.\n 4. From 1, 2 and 3 - a zygote has the right to life.\n 5. The current laws do not reflect 4, and should. (It all gets a bit hazy here, because I never got around to asking Chuz if he considered abortion to be illegal, unconstitutional or what. I'm gonna assume he's gone with 'unconstitutional' and leave it at that.)\n \n Chuz thinks this because:\n 1:It's in the Constitution, which he's never seen reason to doubt and seems intuitively true ('self-evident')\n 2:I've yet to see this, although I think he may have mentioned something about biology defining humanity, not 'personhood'.\n 3: He's got some dictionary definitions for 'human' and 'individual'\n 4: Basic logic\n 5: I haven't seen this either, but that's because I haven't gone into enough details at this point (see above)\n \n Ian argues against this because:\n 1: Such blind faith in the Constitution (and it's Amendments with Capital As) is akin to scripture-worship. \"It sounds right to me\" is not an argument you should be using when you are proposing your views as Truth (or, at the very least, Legislature). Clearly many other people have views which 'seem right to them' and which conflict with yours, so to be pushing for legislature forcing them to change their behaviour on such a foundation is very weak.\n \n 2. Not much to say here because there isn't that much to argue against other than a half-remembered phrase. I need a position before I can dispute it :p.\n \n 3. Definitions of words are hardly objectively 'absolute'. There are also plenty of counter definitions - I'm still waiting for a reply on that in this thread.\n \n 4. Can't fault the logic\n \n 5. Depends. If you're arguing that it's 'unconstitutional' then this isn't the case, because Roe vs Wade was 'due process'. If you're just arguing that you disagree with the ruling, fair enough.\n \n Your turn...\n \n As an aside, this (stumbled upon while looking for something else) is interesting, if you want to talk about the Framer's 'original intent'. \"Under Common Law existing at the time of the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, \"natural personhood\" was considered to begin at natural birth and end with the cessation of the heartbeat. But technology has created a new situation, opening the way for statute or court decision to extend this definition and set the conditions under which personhood begins and ends.\"\n \n EDIT: Oh yes, Charlie's post. Sorry, I forgot it in my rambling.\n \n Pretty much - I agree. It's be interesting to see the reasons behind why such 'regimes' are justified, though. My justification can probably be summed up in this post about the 'quality of life' and 'freedom vs security'.",

   "I voted that our rights come from \"Man : Our rights are what we claim them to be. \" However, the situation is more complicated than that.\n \n In a Democracy, rights are ultimately determined by the people, at least for particular rights that are important enough to them to strongly affect voting habits. Otherwise, in non-Democracies or for rights about which people are relatively apathetic, then it is the government which ultimately decides.\n \n Another complication is that the founders of the US were influenced by Enlightment philosophy and its views on natural rights. However, the trouble with natural rights philosophy is that politicians and philosophers who believed in natural rights could not agree as to the details of what those rights should be. The founders of the US certainly disagreed about certain rights - the most glaring example being their disagreement about slavery. So, the concept of natural rights only would have worked in practice, as opposed to theory disconnected from practice, if the politicians or philosophers had agreed on them - which they didn't. That left rights essentially determined by political consensus - where it has stayed.",

I probably had 25 giant bags of dirty linens, covered in god knows what, that I had to put into the wash. As I finished unloading, a young man (I'd say 25 y/o) came up to me and asked what I do.

   "\n One needs to specific about which rights they're referring to, in order to know whether or not those rights exist in a given society. People have rights in China, and in a number of cases, more rights than people in the United States. For example, people are regarded as having a right to healthcare. They are also regarded as having certain fundamental rights concerning housing. Whereas, that fundamental right is not recognized in the United States, and we have large homeless populations as a result. On the other hand, the Chinese do not have the same free speech or associative rights as exists in the States or concerning religious practice. Women do not have the same reproductive rights, either. In Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, however, women's rights are even more greatly restricted and non-existent, in a manner that does not exist in the United States or even China.\n \n If you want to see some grotesque inequities, look there, instead.\n\n \n Funny, that you mention housing rights in China. In China they bulldoze whole neighbourhoods to make room for buildings. Similarly when the government decides to build a damn, they displace thousands of people. Do you think those affected are asked if they want to move or are they compensated?\n To me the fundamental rights are : freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom to practice or not practice a religion, freedom of association, freedom to live wherever you want, and of course freedom to travel abroad, a fair and just legal system.\n But a right to housing? Or a right to free medical care? I don't know. Even if those rights don't exist in the US, I'd rather live there than in China, Cuba or North Korea.\n \n \n Chao emoticon_xclown",

Similarly when the government decides to build a damn, they displace thousands of people. Do you think those affected are asked if they want to move or are they compensated?\n\n \n Well, they are not the only government that does that sometimes, and sometimes, for good reason. Although I read about this one situation where they moved an unwilling community and bulldozed their huts, and I felt opposed to as well. Plus, the government looked pretty brutal in how they carried it out. But my point was simply that everyone there is ensured a roof over their head. And even though they are (or were, should I say) a much poorer country than, for example, the U.S.\n \n It's one thing to say -- you have the right to go out and obtain this for yourself. But if market conditions are such that it's virtually impossible for the average citizen -- the \"liberty\" to pursue such a dream, and under the notion that anyone who's willing to apply themselves can, indeed, achieve it, is a bogus notion of liberty -- at that point.\n \n \nTo me the fundamental rights are : freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom to practice or not practice a religion, freedom of association, freedom to live wherever you want, and of course freedom to travel abroad, a fair and just legal system.\n\n \n Well, I basically agree with you, except that I don't see myself as entitled to travel anywhere I would like to travel, abroad. (For that matter, the U.S., too.) After all, other countries have a right to police their borders and within my own country, others have property rights that restrict my movements.\n \n \nBut a right to housing? Or a right to free medical care? I don&#8217;t know.\n\n \n Again, I think it comes down to the conditions that make things possible. I don't know that people have a right to \"free medical care,\" but I think people have a right to medical care. When you get into the how's of delivering that, most countries that provide that kind of decency of standard resort to taxes.\n \n How they're going to collect insurance mandates is a whole other story. Likely, they will wind up having to tax, instead.\n \n I liked the signs in the U.K. when they demonstrated: \"Abolish Money.\" You know, in Gene Roddenberry's envisioned society of the future, that's exactly how human beings discovered they needed to live.\n \n \nEven if those rights don&#8217;t exist in the US, I&#8217;d rather live there than in China, Cuba or North Korea.\n\n \n Living in any of those countries would depend on what I was doing. There are any number of jobs abroad that could be quite interesting there. It's one's contribution or way of making of difference that matters. Plus, the people of China and Cuba are wonderful (I\"m sure they are in North Korea, too, but the only people I've known from the area are from the south). In Cuba, for example, people are very well educated, there are many artists and musicians. Lots of people have gone to college and graduate school, though there is high unemployment. (And of course, the U.S. unemployment rate is no longer a counter to their system, is it. Even when we are fudging the facts. And at least they don't have to worry about medical care or losing their homes and retirement pensions. There's a certain basic standard of safety for citizens).\n \n Now I wouldn't want to live in a country where women are regarded as ****. (Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc.) But, again too, maybe if I were working with women in that country to better such a scenario, maybe I would.\n \n I *absolutely*, however, wouldn't want to live in a war-torn country.

   "Rights are what others allow you to have.\n \n At the highest, you have a totalitarian despot who's accumulated power allows the person to give themselves what ever 'rights' they desire.\n \n At the lowest, you have those less than slaves. A good example would be the concentration camp Jews. They had NO rights. Not even to life. They existed to be used and that was only until they could be exterminated.\n Even a slave often has some limited rights. Rules placed upon their owners to proper conduct. and care.\n\n \n for 'others' to decide what 'rights' you have, they must have the power to enforce their decisions.\n rights come from society. In societies where individualism is the highest value then of course individuals have freedom in every sense of the word. In totalitarian states where the state is the highest value then of course individual have no rights, they are just cells in the state organism.\n Fascism and Marxism are good examples of it.\n Like Antonia and other western middle class leftists, they reckon that providing the minimum requirement for people to survive is granting them 'rights' such as a little crappy apartment, a basket of food staples, health services. Forget about true rights: freedom of speech, freedom of association, justice, etc",

   "There are higher standards for quality of living, in certain respects, that these chains must meet when they enter other nations. But their goal is to ever dumb down the public as to what's \"good stuff\", downgrade the quality. \n \n My recollection of service in France is that it was fine, but they don't \"kiss tukus,\" indeed, they're refreshingly not obsequious. Personally, I don't care for service where the waitor or waitress is all over you for the evening. in France, they don't need to act like that because the \"tip\" is included as a minimum percentage in the bill.\n \n As it should be, IMO.\n \n Did I mention my experience in Olive Garden, U.S.A.? Would never return, and it has nothing to do with their poor politics, or poor food, for that matter. Terrible, terrible service. No matter how much money you're popping down, too. They don't let you sit for a meal, and converse, like Europe. You're supposed to eat and run, they don't even care if they're losing business on expensive desserts and dessert drinks. The line and its movement, at regular and rapid intervals, reigns supreme.\n\n \n You get, what you pay for and I find McDonalds good value for what they charge everywhere I have travelled.\n In Quebec we went into a restaurant where they sat the non-French speaking patrons on one side of the restaurant and the local on the other. Of course the service and the food was different on each side. Once we sat there for 15 minutes and nothing .. not even the menu, so we left. They were probably happy to be rid of us.\n In Montreal we got the entree and after that we waited for half an hour and again nothing what we ordered never materialized so we paid for the salad and left. Like Italians do in Italy, the French in Quebec serve s*** to tourists and charge them double the price. From then on we ate just McDonalds. \n \n Here in Australia there are some places like the one you mention, but not many, for would you go back in there again?\n \n By the way, I didn't like the Frenchie part of Canada, I found the towns and cities dirty, shabby. Nothing to see really apart from the old city in Quebec on the river bank.\n Over all I found Canada to be like a faded carbon copy of the USA, dull and boring.",

   "[QUOTE]\nNo, I did not. I had children in the car and my first responsibility is to them. \n \n Although I understand most homeless people are harmless, many have mental illness problems and I do not accept that doing so, as some propose, is a safe practice. \n\n \n Ok, so some homeless people are dangerous, good excuse for not helping them (but not so good excuse for then proceeding to whine about no one else helping them)\n \n \nThe problem, though, is that there was no one to \"phone\" to do so either. \n\n \n Yes, just because you don't help homeless people no one else will either, right?\n \n \nYou don't want to call the police because they might end up making his life even more difficult. \n\n \n Oh wait, there is someone to call. Funny, there might be all kinds of groups. You've just never bothered to find out.\n \n \nBut it would be nice if there were a group that offers to transport people and their belongings to a temporary shelter with air conditioning.\n\n \n There are. Maybe you should volunteer...\n \n \nHe was not far from a major mall, too. Which was air conditioned. And which is even more disgraceful to me. That is, he could have gone there for relief, but likely they wouldn't have allowed him to sit inside because of how he looked. Even though many residents were doing exactly that, for the day. Sitting in a mall for heat relief.\n\n \n Wait, this guy was too dangerous to be around YOUR kids but you'll quickly volunteer the children of the mall patrons to hand out with the guy. Beautiful!\n \n \n \nIt would not have bothered me if he was in the mall with all his belongings. I suspect many others would have felt similarly. Most people are not that heartless. \n\n \n Again, why didn't you stop to give him a ride...oh cause you didn't want your kids around him. But I'm sure you went back after you dropped the kids off and let him chill in your car's AC for a bit..\n \n \nA friend of mine supports people using a local McDonalds in his area because, as a business, they allow homeless to sit there and drink a coffee. Funny to hear people support McDonalds, of all places, but that one in particular was different.\n\n \n Yes, its weird to support a place that's so evil that they're virtually disappearing from the American marketplace.\n \n \n \n \nI don't know what you're blathering about. You are the one in fantasies. Fantasies about others and where they're coming from.\n\n \n Better to be a dreamer than a hypocrite, IMHO.\n \n \nWhy don't you try to listening to others share themselves, for a change, instead of your relentless decisions about who other people are and what they're about? And usually simple minded sexist stereotypes, when it comes to women.\n\n \n Maybe you should try practicing what you preach. Your BS might be more convincing if you actually believed in it.",

   "[QUOTE]\n In India, McDs discriminate in hiring, based on gender (almost only men), and have a vegetarian menu.\n \n \n \n Although I couldn't find anything about this on Google, I'm sure you are right that McDonald's company policy IS to discriminate against women in India, the US, and everywhere else. I'm glad you boycott it.\n \n \nThere was a McDs that was actually providing social security numbers to people they were knowingly hiring illegally\n. \n \n Is that a corporate policy? Or the action of a single franchisee?\n \n \n Another one that was sued by these two young African American women (and honorably working their way through the community college) because the manager didn't want to hire them if they didn't take off their hijabs (it was a Michigan Muslim community, so nothing unusual, and McDs hires men who wear Turbans for religious reasons in other American urban areas).\n\n \n LOL, you've obviously never worked at a fast food place! Loose, flowing clothing would be a super fast way to end up in the hospital with 3rd degree burns from the fry oil. Of course you could just get lucky and slip and fall on the greasy floor after getting tangled up. Further more, its unsanitary to have clothing dangling in your food. But most importantly, why SHOULDN'T these ladies get special treatment. Everyone else should wear the UNIFORM but them. Makes sense to me. \n \n \n \n \nSo, McDs has a checkered history, Ronald McDonald b-day parties and playgrounds notwithstanding.\n\n \n Yes, such a terrible, evil place!\n \n [QUOTE]\nBut you might never eat at another McDs again, despite the kindness of some of the businesses mentioned ITO homeless patrons, as well as convenience for moms at others,\n \n \n No YOU might not eat there if the homeless are hanging out...or at least your poor kids wouldn't be able to use the playground.\n \n \nMontanan and Sidney (? Germany? McDs Chile?) coffee, Texan whoppers, if you'd ever seen that movie about the man who uses himself as a guinea pig, to see what would happen if he ate only McD food for a certain extended period of time. \"Supersize Me\" (or something like that). <gag< (I guess the filmmaker also had a gold plated health insurance policy. *Spoiler Alert* The documentary also follows him in and out of doctors' offices until he is literally at death's door.)\n\n \n \n Yes, if you eat nothing but fat and salt EVERY meal, EVERY day that can happen. Fortunately Fast Food restaurants are the only places that serve fat and salt.\n \n \nLike the story about the homeless man in 100 degree heat, I am drawn to challenging cases.\n\n \n Yes and you fight tirelessly, typing furiously to change the world, completely mitigating ANY responsibility you'd otherwise have to actually do ANYTHING to actually help ANYONE! Antonia, saving the world, one paragraph at a time!\n \n \n \nPerhaps it is because you have your lucid moments, Winston. Everyone has potential and I am gifted with the ability to see it, even in persons like yourself.\n\n \n Look deep within yourself, what do you see?",
