It is the easiest hidden by making a premise look like a conclusion which is what that statement has done. You are not the first to post this argument, although undoubtedly, you thought you were. This has been argued almost as often as the statement that \"there are no absolutes\" a statement that is inconsistent in its very existency (being an absolute statement). \n \n Please read some of the other posts on this topic. Egads man, try an original thought instead of posting someone elses idea and trying to defend it. It is a common statement used by those that are strictly \"anti-christian\" which your above quoted statement clearly shows you to be. \n \n I am christian. I am also logical (most of the time). I am also human and make errors. The best arguments on this forum, are original ideas that have developed from study. Not simple attacks. \n \n While the comment by \"God-is-real\" may have been unwelcome, you merely prove his point by your prejudicial reaction (lumping all christians together into some category YOU think appropriate).\n \n Ad hominem will get neither of you anywhere. I have also found the simple God loves you highly insufficient for many. For others, welcome.",

   "Hello Yang:\n making a stone that one cannot lift is not illogical!\n \n In the physical universe that we are in now, no. But as unkerpaulie pointed out in, I think it was post 60 of this thread, that an infinite rock (as far as mass, volume, radius, etc.) would take up all the space avaible (even assuming that the universe was infinitively large), so where do you propose God lift the rock from and where do you propose that he move the infinitely large rock to? You have not answered this fundamental question. Your objection (notice the word \"refutation\" is not used) to unkerpaulie's argument is as follows:\n So a god who creates an infinite universe from nothingness cannot creates an infinite stone. the man who makes this kind of \"argument\" is either shameless, or mindless again, the crux is: can he lift this stone? \n \n Where in this have you replied to unkerpaulie's statement? The only thing that you do say is trying to destroy his/her reputation, i.e. \"shameless, or mindless.\" It is ironic that you accuse others of being these, when you yourself may be committing these accusations (e.g. \"You distort, or purposely deny\" [parts of a persons post]) These words are not needed here. You are also, in the first statement are not getting what unkerpaulie is saying (or purposely \"distorting\" it ;). unkerpaulie said that God can create an infinite rock, but as he/she describes later, God cannot lift the rock into \"nothingness\". When God creates more space, than the rock is no longer infinitively large (by way of radius, mass, volume, etc.). \n \n The last part of the above statement refutes your statement:\n again you words slap back on your face why doesn't god expand the universe so that the stone can be moved freely? like widening the doorway?  \n \n If He creates more space, then the infinite rock cannot be infinitively large or heavy unless it was to also expand into the more space that God created - thus defeating the purpose of God creating more space. Your argument about \"expanding the universe\" does not stand up to reason (or logic) as the rock (infinitively large, heavy, etc.) would no longer be infinitively large (by way of mass, radius, etc.).\n \n Getting back to the original question, can God create a rock that He cannot break - how did we get to God lifting an infinitively large rock when the topic is about God making a rock so hard that He cannot break it (i.e. unbreakable)?? As unkerpaulie stated in post 11 in this thread, i.e. an unbreakable rock is illogical because anything that is solid can be broken. Therefore, this whole objection to God being all powerful is flawed from the start.",

Thus, the notion of all-powerfulness, which leads to such a notion, is also absurd.\n \n You are side stepping unkerpaulie's argument that there are obviously certain illogicalities that can never exist, e.g. a round square, two sided triangle, etc. With this argument considered, your whole argument against the notion of an all powerful God breaks down.\n \n In reference to your number/power analogy, we refer to the largest number as \"infinity \". Similary, God would be infinitively powerful. Basically, you cannot get any more powerful.\n\n \n This is the point I was trying to make.
