   "I agree that programs should obtain parental permission. \n \n I think a clinic field trip can be very educational for students entering (or already in) adolescence. Kids are hands-on, especially a high risk group. So it can be very important for them to see first-hand that there's more than meets the eye to a sexual relationship. There are health, pregnancy, family, and ethical issues. Going on-site can really drive some points home. Rather than just telling students about it. Such a visit, with demonstrators too, can also be a basis for debate and discussion about issues like abortion. Getting students to consider what their opinions on these subjects really are, and that certain choices can lead to much bigger considerations down the road. Such a visit can also help students learn more about science, health, and related occupations they might be interested in.\n \n So I support students having lots of information here as long as the parents are o.k. And as long as the information is presented in a responsible and respectful context, and so that the students can actually use it.\n \n I think it's important to remember that health education is not agreeing with sexual relationships outside of marriage. Even people getting married need to know about these things.\n \n We need a society of informed persons and realistic (and responsible) health education is part of getting there.",

The bible is NOT a reliable source for information on health and well being in the modern world. As they say many things true in biblical days are no longer true. This is espcecially the case regarding sex and reproduction and medical issues. Tecahing how to love is all very fine, but thats not the issue here either. Its the ins and outs of reproduction, the biology and anatomy of sex and sexual relations, the dangers of same, and various options which are available to members of the society.

   "[INDENT]Well its NOT a practicum is it? And when do you want them to learn about controlling their own reproduction? AFTER they reach sexual maturity and become active? Perhaps you are in favor of your daughter becoming pregnant as a teen? Or would you prefer she know enough to act from knowledge and wisdom rather than making it up as she goes along? As to the harm done, well its a lesson for them in reality, and its a lesson boys and girls used to learn even earlier when we were a nation of farmers with lots of livestock around doing their thing, when we got married earlier in life, and when our families had many more children than currently. Those educational elements are now missing from our society and they need to be reinstated. Otherwise our \"problems\" are only likely to get worse.emoticon_wow\n\n \n Plus, with t.v., peers and all, without adults providing this information, kids easily get all wrong information about sex, learning it \"on the street.\" \n \n I think the mistake among parents is that they can shield children from information. They cannot. But they can take steps to ensure that information is accurate.",

   "One characteristic of high risk groups is that no one in the family has usually talked to them about sex (outside of popular culture, peers).\n \n Parents should start talking to their children about sex early on in an age-appropriate way. That makes other information, by the time they are hitting adolescence, much easier to impart, and in a relationship where it is not uncomfortable to talk about such things. \n \n But sometimes the parents don't want to talk about sex at all, and they don't want the schools to talk about it, but believe me, the kids are talking about it. And some of the info they're getting is very mixed up, and at great risk to their lives and futures.\n \n A network t.v. scene I just loved recently showed two persons who barely knew each other, throwing inhibition to the wind, to have sex on a beach, with no condoms.
