   "\n Does that mean you don't think a woman should be responsible for her pregnancy when she made the decision to have sex?\n \n \n I think that a woman and man should both be responsible for the pregnancy and should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy when they decided to have sex. However, I think that responsibility isn't only limited to having the child and caring for it. I consider birth control and abortion as forms of being responsible too. I'm not suggesting that a woman who chose to not use a form of birth control and got pregnant seek an abortion every time, but I consider it more responsible to get an abortion than have a child, feel obligated to raise it, and then have another undernurtured, unhappy, abused and neglected child in the world. In such an instance, I would find that abortion would be responsible; granted, it is not the most responsible but it is remedying the situation. \n \n \nYou asked the question as if you would ask a parent. (More or less a mother from the impression I got.) The Mother in your article didn't seem to give two lumps of sugar for the welfare of her child. The girl smokes (and continues to smoke through her pregnancy) and drank alcohol. You would think this nice caring mother (whom you're asking the question of whether she should live with a pregnancy or not) would be able to notice and confront these problems earlier than this.\n \n I don't think that Mom has shown any care or any concern for her own influence on her daughter's life. I don't think you should be asking her that sort of question.\n \n I hope you can see what I mean now. If I took anything out of context, let me know.\n\n \n Ok, it is true that I phrased the question as though it were one's daughter but I don't think the fact that her mother wasn't that involved in her life changes the question. I was not asking anyone to be that mother. The question was based around the idea that anyone, with their own set of morals and beliefs and not the mother's would want condone their 11 year-old child having a baby. So let me phrase it in a different manner. Would you want that little girl to become a mother at the age and level of maturity that she is at now or would you permit an abortion? \n \n Sorry if that was confusing.",

While I do believe emotionally she would have scars, there would be emotional scarring if she gave her child up for adoption as well. Yes, abortions have been forced upon people but who's to say that the 11 year-old didn't have the knowledge to think of or decided on the option herself? Either adopting or abortion would have great consequences.",

You can search PubMed at www.pubmed.gov\n \n 2. Think about this intuitively. Think about the medical implications along the spectrum of\n \n a. the controlled situation of an elective abortion, earlier on in pregnancy in an otherwise healthy woman.\n b. an unexpected, spontaneous abortion\n c. an ectopic pregnancy, the rupture of which may be life-threatening.\n d. a full term pregnency with all the inherent and significant physiologic changes that occur, especially if there is any other illness.\n \n So it make sense that the numbers would align in that order.\n \n 3.

Testimony is nearly worthless as evidence to prove the existence of a causal relationship, most especially in a situation with numerous variables. This concept is something that is very important to learn to be able to think critically.\n \n I totally respect a person to hold the opinion that they think abortion is wrong. I whole-heartedly disagree with it, but I respect the right to hold such an opinion. Because it is an opinion. A subjective statement for which there is no right or wrong.\n \n However, it infuriates me when pro-lifers quite literally invent medical reasons to support their cause. You are less to blame. You are merely gullible enough to believe them. I can understand, as you swallow all the christian dogma willingly. However, those that publish such lies know full well that they are lies. How moral is that?\n \n This is the truth, to the extent that it is known:\n 1. All evidence very clearly supports that an elective abortion is much safer than pregnancy.\n 2. There is no evidence to suggest (and it has been studied) that some psychological syndrome associated with abortion even exists. Here is a blurb from Up-to-Date, which is an online publication that summarizes the latest info about medical topics.\n \n \nFrom Up-To-Date \n \n \n Quote:\n WOMEN'S FEELINGS AFTER PREGNANCY TERMINATION - The most common emotional reactions after pregnancy termination are relief, transient guilt, sadness, and a sense of loss [1]. There is no good evidence from large surveys that choosing to terminate an unwanted first pregnancy places a woman at higher risk of subsequent depression than choosing to deliver an unwanted first pregnancy [2]. The frequency of psychiatric diagnoses in women who have undergone an abortion procedure is similar to that in women with no such history. Risk factors for postabortal psychosocial problems include previous or concurrent psychiatric illness, coercion, medical indications that force the patient to chose between possible life threatening complications and termination of a wanted pregnancy, increasing length of gestation, ambivalence, and lack of social support [3,4]. In 1993, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders revised (DSM-IV-R) ceased to recognize abortion as a type of psychosocial stressor.\n \n 1.

   "I give up. You've locked yourself away in some sort of haven of disclosure from the realities of what abortion does to so many women. Years later even, if you read many of the testimonies. I am never coming to this topic again.\n\n \n If you want to give up, fine. I think you are mistaken of who is not in touch with reality. It looks like you are giving up without ever actually finding any scientific evidence of the rates of post-abortion problems.\n \n I think you really need to understand the implications of testimony.\n If I had a broken leg and became very despondent about it because I could never tap dance again, my mental state would be directly due to the leg fracture. One could not state that breaking a leg causes depression, however. \n \n Do you think that the women that have no ill affects from abortion ever speak up about it? Testimonies from one side are meaningless unless you compare them to the whole sample. If you select for those that have a bad outcome, you don't hear from those with a good outcome. That is called selection bias. I don't think the concept is too hard to understand. If you see the infomercials of the folks that feel great from some worthless pill, does that tell you anything? \n \n You need to know the RATE at which something happens. How many of some kind of result divided by all who underwent the intervention. You are always spouting off about the gillions of abortions that occur. That is the denominator. You need to understand the percent of bad post abortion outcomes compared to the total. This is essential to understand. \n \n You are missing a rudimentary understanding of this issue. So lose the condescending comments. What does \"haven of disclosure mean\" anyway?",
