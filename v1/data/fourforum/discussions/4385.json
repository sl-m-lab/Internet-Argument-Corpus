   "Great Britain and nuclear bomb for terrorists\n Meanwhile British Nuclear Group and Department of Trade and Industry is occupied with creation of a new Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), supervisory body of the Center at Sellafield, tries to explain loss of 30 kg of plutonium as a \"paper loss\". I'd stress that it has happened at that moment when our country is teeming with various kinds of Islamic extremists - from Kashmir's to Chechen ones. And Sellafield is not a single place in this list. Generally in 2004 British nuclear objects have lost such quantity of nuclear materials that would be enough for 7-8 nuclear bombs! Having this incredible chance, terrorists certainly plan to acquire some nuclear or \"dirty\" bomb or, maybe, they are on the road to fulfillment of their main goal.\n According to some information secret investigation is instituted in British Nuclear Center at Sellafield in connection of its plutonium loss now. Some officials, who are a bit of thieves, turned out to be concerned with it and by all means they've received great money rewards for it.\n Thus, British special services have again missed their marks. Simply in the case of Iraq they pike and in this case they overlooked the situation around nuclear components.\n In other words, Great Britain greatly soiled its reputation. And I think, we simply have no moral right to condemn other states for similar failures in the sphere of storage of their own used nuclear fuel.\n By the way, I take an interest in US business in this field. It's reported that USA doesn't admit IAEA inspectors to all US nuclear objects. It seems to me they have fallen out, too.",
