   "Cleared: Builder who chopped off thug's ear with Samurai sword after he threatened to rape and kill his family | Mail Online\n \n \nA father who defended his family from drug-crazed thugs by wounding one with a Samurai sword has been cleared by a jury.\n \n David Fullard, 47, was prosecuted for attacking the two strangers who forced their way into his home and threatened to rape his partner and kill his two teenage children.\n \n He insisted he was a desperate man acting legally in self-defence and struck out once with the ornamental sword, because it was the only weapon to hand.\n \n The blow almost sliced off the ear of Michael Severs, one of the thugs.\n \n The prosecution refused to accept that his actions amounted to lawful self-defence and argued it was 'over the top' to attack a man armed with a knuckleduster by using a 'battlefield weapon'.\n \n The two thugs were both high on a cocktail of drink and drugs at the time, the court heard.\n \n But after a five-day trial at Hull Crown Court, Mr Fullard, a builder, broke down in tears as he was found not guilty of unlawful wounding.\n \n It ended a nine-month ordeal for a man described by neighbours as 'honest and caring'. He had faced the threat of a long prison term.\n \n The case represents another landmark in the debate over how far a householder should be allowed to go in defending his home from an intruder.\n \n Yesterday jobless Severs, 22, and Michael Smith, 19, escaped with a suspended prison sentence and 100 hours of community work after admitting affray at the court.\n \n Judge Michael Mettyear then lifted a reporting restriction on the case.\n \n Outside court Mr Fullard criticised the judge for allowing the men to get away with a 'slap on the wrists'.\n \n He added: 'You cannot stand around and do nothing when someone-comes to your house and starts threatening your family.'\n \n Mr Fullard has been supported throughout by partner Susan Neal, 53, and his sons Danny, 14, and Tom, 17, who were in the house during the incident in March last year.\n \n He added: 'I only struck one blow with the sword. If there had been a walking stick or umbrella by the door I would have hit him with that.'\n \n The court heard Severs and Smith, who both have previous convictions for violence, vaguely knew Mr Fullard's elder son and knocked on the door of the family home in Brough, East Yorkshire, claiming he owed them \u00a35 from earlier in the day.\n \n It was a ruse to get cash but Smith barged into the living room while Mr Fullard was upstairs and threatened Miss Neal. She told the jury he picked up the ornamental sword and said: 'Do you want some of this?'\n \n She said: 'They threatened to rape me, burn the house down, kill the kids and kill Dave.'\n \n Smith then ran out and Mr Fullard was confronted by Severs in the garden. The thug was armed with a spade and a knuckle-duster.\n \n Mr Fullard told the jury he picked up the sword and 'hit him once' and intended for the 'flat of the sword' rather than the blade to connect. He then called police.\n \n Mr Fullard was arrested and only later did police arrest Smith and Severs, who had his ear re-attached in hospital.\n\n \n It's reasons like this I'm glad we left the UK. When you threaten to rape and murder and entire family, and you're in less trouble than the person you threatened, that's not a sign of the country being safe or worth living in; especially when this is the rule and not the exception.",

   "Remember who we're arguing with.\n \n It's Britain. They do not live in America. In America, we have this wonderful thing called \"The Constitution of the United States of America\".\n \n This wonderful thing is a gift that many do not understand because they do not live within its sphere of influence.\n \n They don't have the appreciation of it because they do not have the benfits provided by it.\n \n You see, here in America, it is written in stone that the people have these funny things called \"rights\" that exist independently of the government. We, here in America, are endowed by our creator. We grant the power to our government to regulate, because we already posess freedom.\n \n Since we Americans have lived under the protection of the Constitution, we often falsely react to situations in Britain with the same frame of mind we would use here in America. This is wrong. We Americans cannot do this and be correct.\n \n Just because we believe that human beings have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as it is mandated by our Constitution, this is not the case in foreign countries.\n \n Therefore, we do not have the right to preach and lecture those in Britain about freedom. Just because we here in America righteously believe that an individual is born with a right and is soveriegn unto his or herself does not mean that folks in other countries hold this to be true. We are Americans. Here, people are born free. Our freedom and our entire viewpoint is based on this fact. Just because each individual here is soveriegn, and we are the ones who impose limits to our government does not hold true for Britain.\n \n In Britain, the government allows. The government is the source of all things. In Britain, a person's soveriegnity is allowed by the government. Since this is allowed, it can therefore be subject to NOT being allowed. The government holds the rights and distributes the power as it chooses. This is where we get the term \"subject\". Brits fall into this category. They are \"subject\" to the government.\n \n Here in America, our own personal sovereignity leads to the logical conclusion that one's self is private property. One is allowed to protect this property. When a person is at \"home\", it is logical that the defense of soveriegnity extends to one's righteous occupation of space; our home. If, say, a bloodthirsty serial killer were to commit a violent felony in breaking into this soveriegn space, it is logical that this violent felon could have chosen NOT to do so. In choosing to violate the sanctity of our soveriegn space, the criminal VOLUNTEERS to receive the consequences. We Americans are allowed to defend this sanctity by DIVINE RIGHT. God.\n \n We cannot force our belief in a right we enjoy onto people that only exist at the discretion of a government and not God. The British law says that their subjects must use \"appropriate\" measures. The \"appropriate\" measure is whatever their government tells them is appropriate. They are \"subject\" to this. Therefore, there is no benefit for them in agreeing to our constitutionally protected rights. They will never enjoy them. Why spend time and energy defending a belief you will never enjoy? Why pine and moan about how just and righteous personal soveriegnity is, when you will never be allowed to taste it? \n \n Arguing about how and why human beings should be free is pointless when there is no way those you argue against have the means to become so. There is no benefit for them to agree. They will still only be allowed to do only what their government dictates. \n \n The British government has dictated they have no right to comfort and solitude in their own homes. One must be subject to requirements of \"appropriateness\" when defending against rapists and murderers forcing themselves into one's own dwelling. One is still subject to judgement even in the face of violent and felonious behavior by persons beyond their control regardless of location.\n \n There is no point in Americans illustrating the inequity of this. They are subjects and always will be. Why should they agree with us? It gains them nothing.",

   "application of those is in the hands of your government\n\n \n Wrong!\n \n The application is in OUR hands. There are no laws stating what actions one is allowed to perform. If so, lawbooks would be very large as \"eating an apple\" would have to be specifically listed as would \"eating an orange\" and \"peeling an apple\" and \"shoveling dirt\"....why, to list each and every possible course of action would be pretty tedious.\n \n Therefore, it is fairly certain that things NOT listed as being regulated are implicitly allowed.\n \n WE THE PEOPLE determine what our government puts on the list.\n \n Castle Doctrine, however such clueless anti-gunners wish to describe it, is a law that simple moves the burden of proof from the VICTIM of a self defense situation to the prosecutor. Anti-gunners often mistakenly describe Castle Doctrine as \"a licence to kill\".\n \n Nothing could be further from the truth. \n \n We, here in America, are all considered innocent until proven guilty.......PROVEN guilty. By arresting a person who shoots an invader, then requiring that person to justify his use of force, it removes the presumption of innocence. The person is arrested and then has to prove his innocence. What happened to innocent until proven guilty? Why does a defender have to justify anything? I thought that person was assumed innocent?\n \n The only thing Castle Doctrine does, is require a prosecuting attorney to provide evidence that a person did NOT act in self defense before bringing charges. (As it should be). If the shot person is lying unarmed on the sidewalk, the guy with the gun is running down an alley, there are twenty holes in the dead guy and 19 of the bullets are recovered from the ground below the dead guy's body, I'm guessing this is probably enough evidence that at least 19 of the bullets were not a case of self defense.\n \n However, if a married father of four is in his own livingroom with the door busted down and there's a masked man laying dead on the floor with a machete, There probably isn't enough evidence that this father did anything illegal. All the evidence points at THE GUY WITH A MACHETE being the one who broke the law. The cops can still arrest the father and take him to jail, but without Castle Doctrine the father would have to explain his actions IN HIS OWN HOME (Kind of what happened to your samurai sword wielder) when HE DID NOTHING TO PROVOKE A MURDERER INTO COMMITING A VIOLENT CRIME.\n \n With Castle Doctrine, the PROSECUTOR has to show evidence that the man's actions were NOT SELF DEFENSE. Something the British prosecutors would find impossible with Mr. Samurai. Good thing for the British government that they get to require him to act in an appropriate manner that they choose. (Even though their family wasn't the ones at risk)\n \n Now, even though Castle Doctrine is state enacted legislation and the requirement of district attorneys is different depending on a particular state's Castle Doctrine, the entire country still posesses the right to self defense in one's own dwelling. Whether ot not a prosecutor has a burden of proof is the only thing determined by Castle Doctrine.\n \n So why do these nutter antis still refer to Castle law as \"shoot first\" law or \"Make my Day\" law when it has nothing to do with shooting but with the burden of proof?\n \n Evidently, they should move to Britain where the government holds all the cards. This is what they're crying for when they believe people who are considered innocent until proven guilty should have to prove their innocence instead.\n \n If this is the case, why doesn't the government arrest everyone and require us to explain why we should be let go? This is what they're arguing for by opposing Castle Doctrine.",

The Bill of Rights codifies some specific rights, some of which were recognised previously in the common law system, and others which were not, to ensure that those rights are permanently protected. The right to self-defence is not specifically included in those, but is recognised as a result of the common law system. Various states have passed laws to enhance this right beyond what was identified by common law. The fact that you feel these rights are God given is neither here nor there.",

   "How do you determine what was necessary for the security of his person?\n\n \n The same way somebody decides that they're too hammered to drive home from the bar; good old fashioned common sense. Everybody has it, everybody has the capacity to exercise it.\n \n \nWhat if he decided using a RPG launcher was necessary for that security?\n\n \n What if he had?\n \n You do realize that the launcher to an RPG is nothing more than a simple metal tube, don't you? How much harm could it really do as opposed to using a lead pipe?\n \n And BTW, this is Britain we're talking about. Where would he get an RPG launcher, nevermind a functioning shape charge to fire from it?\n \n \nSociety as whole has to make that determination, we have legal guidelines and trial by jury to do it. This is the same point I've been making all along.\n\n \n And the point still remains that the person you insisted putting on trial was the victim in this matter. His home was invaded, his family was threatened with a deadly weapon.\n \n the very fact that a case like this even went to trial, is just another example of how far the nanny state culture has been allowed to go in Britain. You as a people and a nation have given up the concept of free thought, in trade for letting the government tell you what you're supposed to think is right.",

Britain is a signatory of the UN Declaration on human rights, and the European Convention on human rights, which is enforcable throught the courts.\n \n The phrasing of the your constitution is an irrelevance, the people deciding what force is appropriate are jurors, not politicians, and in fact it would be judges (a branch of government) in the US who decide whether the castle doctrine is obligated by the constitution, and I suspect that it is a matter of state law, rather than constitutional right (wikipedia seems to bear this out, but feel free to post information that contradicts this). You may talk about inalienable rights all you want but the interpretation and application of those is in the hands of your government as much as it is in ours, except we at least have some recourse beyond our own borders to the European courts if the British ones fail us.\n\n \n Interesting that you would see an authority, outside of your country, with super-authority over your country, as being a GOOD thing.\n We shudder at the thought of the UN imposing its will on our sovereignty. emoticon_wow",
