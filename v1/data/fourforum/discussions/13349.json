   "It is becoming clearer that the Left has ZERO intentions on having a dialog with us, or continuing to try and provide a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. One thing is for sure. They are trying every slimy trick in the book to try and trivialize us, our hopes for this country, and sometimes what the Constitution says. It is ever clearer that they want to shut us up! \n \n Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) alarm: 'Militiamen, white supremacists, anti-Semites, nativists, tax protesters coalescing' ? \n \n  Cops, deputies warned again about right-wing 'terrorists' \n A private activist organization apparently is picking up where the federal government left off when the Department of Homeland Security issued its \"Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment\" warning that returning veterans and people in a long list of other categories were potential terrorists. \n \n Only the new warning, delivered recently to police officers, sheriffs and other law enforcement personnel across the country, is lumping those dedicated to the constitutional principles on which the nation was founded together with crazed killers. \n\n \n  Constitutionalists are not the haters \n SPLC is spreading not only a damnable and insulting lie, but actually creating a dangerous environment, one that chills free speech and political activism. If that doesn't qualify for the term \"un-American,\" nothing does.\n \n It's part of a wider effort, one of the oldest dirty political tricks really: fling mud and count on something sticking--particularly in the minds of the the uninformed and those predisposed to subordinate our freedom to the state. It's used by people counting on ignorance and prejudice to enable achievement of their ends.\n \n It's the stuff that makes bigotry work.\n\n \n Ahhhh! There is the problem! Intelligence and the words Southern Poverty Law Center in combination. More like a Left Winged Slime Plot report!\n \n What worries me is that, If they keep this up, they just may get the war they are working so very hard to start! \n \n I know I am getting awfully darned tired of their Slime, and their ways!",
