   "Creating the Big O exclusively for women:\n \nAt 7 a.m. each day, as the rest of America is eating Cheerios or trying to face gridlock without hyperventilating, about a dozen women, naked from the waist down, lie with eyes closed in a velvet-curtained room, while clothed men huddle over them, stroking them in a ritual known as orgasmic meditation - \"OMing,\" for short. The couples, who may or may not be romantically involved, call one another \"research partners.\"\n \n A commune dedicated to men and women publicly creating \"the orgasm that exists between them,\" in the words of one resident, may sound like the ultimate California satire. But the Bay Area has a lively and venerable history of seekers constructing lives around sexual adventure.\n \n San Francisco is proud of its libertine heritage, as Sean Penn recently demonstrated in \"Milk.\" The search for personal transformation, including through sex, led to the oceanside hot tubs at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, cradle of the human potential movement, and in the 1960s, communes flourished in the city, many espousing free love.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/fashion/15commune.html\n \n I've got the trank guns at the ready.\n \n Oh, pass the word to ER as well and others of his ilk.

It is our Creator God, Yahweh, that's who.

And that you think it's we believers who condemn those desires as bad or evil. \n \n It isn't sex, orgasms or sensuality which is bad or evil simone, it's the corrupted application of these natural and normal desires which is wrong. At least you felt stupid enough to take references to me and Chuz out of the title of this thread. Archie? Chutzy? It's Time for Hysterics... emoticon_xchicken And one more thing, Chuz isn't motivated by a faith in Christ as I am, so attempting to link us according to that standard is just one more ridiculous assumption you have made.",

   "Not every woman achieves sexual climax in exactly the same way. Women are not a collection of paperdoll cutout clones.\nExactly! As a matter of experience, I have found no two women exactly the same in regard to what it took to get them off the edge. They're like snowflakes, each different in some tiny way or in a multitude of ways. \n \n Not that I've achieved a great goal surpassing the scores of my contemporary male friends, but the last time I took the trouble to remember each lady's name and face that I have managed to induce into a \"big O\" or two, there were forty three names on the list...all different types of ladies, each with similar physical equipment but diverse mental requirements.\n \n You women are NUTS!\n \n \n \n\n If you believe that, you are a lousy lover. And, you care little about the needs and desires of individual women, who happen to be individuals.\nBelieve me, I care enough to send the very best...and I have been called everything but a lousy lover.\n \n \n \n\n But, alas, some religions consider women to be a subset of men, their rib, their little slavey, their always available source of sexual pleasure in absolutely any way a man desires it. Which is why prostitution flourishes. For that reason and the reality of economic inequality between men and women.\nGee, that's a bummer...you growin' up in a subset and all. I've not ever (in my recollectable life) considered ladies to be a subset. They are actually superior to men, having held on to that which is most desirable as a destination spot and using the marketing thereof (by way of sale or barter) to attain whatever they really needed and then some. Females have had the upper hand for eons.\n \n I've put women on a pedestal ever since I learned how to erect one.\n \n If you're really in need of the \"big O\" or some smaller multiple \"OOOOOOOOOs\" or some sequential cries like \"Oh, God! Of, God! Oh, God!\", I might be able to help you....in private of course...I'm not into this group therapy you describe. I can single-handedly handle whatever it takes to get you over the edge.\n \n Just remember...I'm no pushover...but I can be made.\n \n \n \n My only hangup is that I have to feel wanted...and I can tell fakery when I feel it.",
