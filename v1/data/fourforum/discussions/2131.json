They must learn to distinguish between what is acceptable natural behavior and what they feel is natural.\n \n \n\n That is not what is being said. Please try to understand, you saying 'you are only allowed to marry someone of the opposite sex, everyone has the same right' is akin to saying 'you are only allowed to marry someone of the same race, everyone has the same right'. It is flawed logic at best and a weak excuse for prejudice at worst. \n\n THe constituion doe not allow laws to be based on race. Every law is allwoed to govern behavior. It's like rapists saying everyone has the right to have sex if it the other person is a consenter. It the other person isn't a consenter then they don't have the right to have sex with them. Behavior is the limits of the law. It can't govern anything else. \n \n \n \n\n Err the Roman Empire's fall was mostly due to mass migration, a run of weak Emperors, the population's tendency towards peace over war, political infighting, economic decline, plagues, and the Visigoth revolution. I doubt any serious historian would list 'liberalisation' as a major factor in it's decline. \n\n \n \n The Fall of the Roman Empire:\n \n Abandonment of the old religion, which had given moral strength to the Roman People [Religious] Widespread HOMOSEXUALITY among the upper classes led to a decline in the birth rate among aristocrats, thereby reducing the available pool of leadership manpower.

So now that we have excahnged insults I won't respond to your insults. We'll just call it even.\nAgreed. I know I've done similar things before, so no harm done.\n \n \n \nMy arguments were very definitive and I believe properly lay out good rationale.\nHowever I disagree with that, but that's what we're here for! :)\n \n \n \nThey are antural. Even from the beginnings of mankind. Also every culture and every soceity has family units so how can you say it's ingrained?\nBut you are talking about from the beginning of civilised mankind, once we moved into societies we moved away from what is natural. \n \n \n \nLook up basic essentials. Clothing is a basic essential. Just because we don't begin with something doesn't mean it's not natural. Eating is natural and we require it. Clothing is a natural need as well.\nActually the basic needs are drink, food and shelter. In that order. Anything else is a product of society. Now whilst it could be argued it is necessary in extreme conditions, such as artic or dessert climate as mentioned before as neither you (I presume) nor I live in such conditions I would say that is irrelevant.\n \n \n \nI guess you don't know what one is then.\nI disagree. Your first comment stated natural is not the 'most common' your second is that it is 'what most people do', ie the 'most common'. \n \n \n \nDeviant is like extreme. When we talk about devicany in anything like statistics we refer to within the normal realm and the extremism in the outlier. So uncharacteristic of normal that it's excluded.\n I see. Well I suppose it is all in the eye of the beholder. Personally I feel homosexuality cannot be considered 'extreme'. Attraction to children or animals yes, but just to others of your own sex?\n \n \n \nDoing what you want isn't necessarily natural. Rapist and serila killers feel their feelings are natural. It isn't, it's deviant. They must learn to distinguish between what is acceptable natural behavior and what they feel is natural.\nBut these people harm society by acting out on their 'deviant' behaviour, hence it is necessary for society to restrict them for it's own defence. Homosexuality hurts nobody, so why should it need to be restricted?\n \n \n \nTHe constituion doe not allow laws to be based on race. Every law is allwoed to govern behavior.\nWell firstly, being British I don't care that much about the constitution. It's a great document but people have too great a tendency to regard it as being some divinely written document that can never be wrong. But that is beside the point. \n \n Constitution or not, do you not see that the 'we all have the same rights' argument is just an excuse to say 'everyone should act how I act'\n \n \n \nThe Fall of the Roman Empire:\n \n Abandonment of the old religion, which had given moral strength to the Roman People [Religious] Widespread HOMOSEXUALITY among the upper classes led to a decline in the birth rate among aristocrats, thereby reducing the available pool of leadership manpower.

That would be quite drastic to make everyone lose the status of their marriage.\n\n \n To me, this entire thing boils down to defining marriage.\n \n It's simple really, to me anyway, there's the religious sacrament of marriage, and then there's the legal union of two people recognized by the state. Somewhere along the line the two got confused - the result is the mess we have today.\n \n Is marriage in the church not a purely relgious ceremony as it stands today? \n The state doesn't care what denomination you are or where you get married, they just want the documents signed. Marriage as recognized by the church is not in any way tied to the status of marriage as recognized by the state, and has no increased or separate legal value\n \n This whole thing is a matter of semantics, and IMHO, it's silly. No one is trying to destroy the Christian's sacrament of marriage or even to degrade it, they simply want equality under the eyes of the law. I can't for the life of me understand the rational of denying these people that right, REGARDLESS of one's feelings about homosexuality.\n \n Waxy",

   "Being Lutheran I can only believe what I am told be sources I feel are reliable, so I will stick with what they have told me.\n \n \n \n If gay marriage is against nature, and that is why it should stay illegal, then isn't all monogamy against nature? It is in the best instruct of the species for the \"best\" to breed, and for the \"worst\" to have there line ended.\n If monogamy is gods plan, then why is it not practiced thru out the bible?\n\n Question: \n What is the Church's position on polygamy? \n \n Answer: \n In 1998, President Gordon B. Hinckley made the following statement about the Church's position on plural marriage: \n \"This Church has nothing whatever to do with those practicing polygamy. They are not members of this Church. . . . If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church.\" \n ...In 1890, President Wilford Woodruff received a revelation that the leaders of the Church should cease teaching the practice of plural marriage (Official Declaration 1). \n http://www.mormon.org/question/faq/category/answer/0,9777,1601-1-114-3,00.html\n \n This is from their official website.\n \n Mongamy is common in nature so is polygamy. We as humans are above the naturalization theory. We include thought into our decisions. We're the least predictable species on earth. We incorporate different reason why we decide to have sex with people. Many times it happens without intent. Darwinism the \"THEORY\" is that the best suited will surviv and perpetruate the best genes. Not necessarily that the best seeking the best. Although the best would be the most appealing. \n \n Monogamy is practiced throughout most of the Bible. There were times when there were so few righeous men and more righteous women that God instructed a few righteous prohets to raise a righteous generation.",

Probably not. \n\n \n You said who would it hurt? I'm asking you who would it hurt if there was prostituion? Just to help you think that there are injuries that are proximate to everyone.\n \n \n \n\n If marriage is so sacred socially, then heterosexuals who get married should never divorce, and quickie marriages that celebrities have all of the time shouldn't be allowed (Not to mention things like Joe Millionaire and the Bachelorette). This shouldn't be a social issue because if it is, it's allowing the government to make individuals to adhere to a set of moral codes that only a select group believes. \n\n The fact is that society ahs degraded amrriage by trivilializing it. We're advocating that it shoudl ahve never been so degraded and this is going toofar in degrading this institution. \n \n \n \n\n The government should approach this as a legal matter, which it is, and allow the legally binding marriage of homosexuals which affords them the same benefits that every other couple who pays 80 bucks to a local courthouse can enjoy. If you have a problem with it socially, then you probably also have a problem with homosexuals in the first place, and thats a problem that you need to deal with on your own. Otherwise, keep your mouth shut and let the government dole out legal unions (or dare I say \"marriages\") to same sex couples and let that be the end of it. If the word marriage bothers you so much because of the religious background of the word, get over it. The word is a useful way to describe the legal binding of any two individuals who may have a different faith than the one where some claim the word's definition is derived from. Atheist couples get married in courthouses because \"marriage\" in the legal sense has no religious affiliation. So, this being a purely legal matter, there should be no question that any two people can enjoy this legal right. \n\n WHy don't you get over it? Just like people hate it when minorites use the race card call everyone racist, I don't like being accuse everyone of being homophobic because they don't agree wiht homosexuals.\n \n I don't like the KKK. Does that mean I have a phobia with white people?\n \n There is no legal precedence for people obtaining a right that isn't contstituionally guaranteed.

   "There is no evidence that is definitve to suggest that. There is only speculation. The fact that there are gays that have changed proves that it is behavior. There is as much evidence to suggest that homosexuality is genetic as there is that serial killing and pedophilia is genetic.\n\n \n Homosexuality is a behaviour? Yep, lots of people choose to be \"outcasts\" in society and discriminated against by people like yourself. They do it for fun.\n \n People switch? That's religious propaganda. Furthermore, even if true, it proves nothing.\n \n \nMy argument does not rest on that it is natural. It relies on various arguments. It's only a policy consideration.\n\n \n OK. So being unnatural is only part of your \"policy consideration\". What is the rest of your policy based on?\n \n \nNo, becasue then I'd ahve to accept every disorder that was genetic such as prostituion (nymphomania).\n\n \n You think the reason prostitution exists is due to nymphomania? Are you serious? Wow.\n \n \nMaintaining the integrity of marriage and not endorsing the behavior as acceptable.\n\n \n Please give me one concrete example of how homosexual marriage destroys the integrity of marriage, as defined by the state, and as it is implemented/used by the state. I don't care about the religious sacrament of marriage here, that's for each religion or figure out on its own.\n \n \nThe law is amde to apply to everyone equally. The law cannot be based upon desires. The law is objective. There is nothing to suggest that they are denied some right. TO be denied a right first there needs to exist that right and second someone else has to have it.\n\n \n What does marriage law have to do with objectivity? Isn't the the fact that marriage is currently defined as a man and woman a subjective definition?\n \n You have the right to marry who you choose to marry, homosexuals do not have that right. You just got lucky at birth and your right is recognized under current laws.\n \n \n I asked you what the purpose of marriage is, you responded with this.\n \n \nIt exists for a variety of reasons. It exists to recognize a family unit and the legally obligating people to fufill their vow to their spouse and children. It exchange for their pledge the government protects that interest in the family\n\n \n B.S.\n \n Don't tell me marriage is to create/protect families, if that were the case, marriages couldn't be undone by the stroke of a pen. That's a farce, and furthermore, it could just as easily be applied to any homosexual couple.\n \n Let me narrow it down further. What is the purpose of marriage laws as defined by the state? Are they in place to protect religious sanctity and morality, or are they in place to define the legal union of two people for the purposes of asset sharing and tax structure? \n \n Marriage is simply contract law in the eyes of the state, any moral or social issues are irrelevent. It's all about money.\n \n \nThat's exactly how our laws are and pne of the policy consdierations. Public lewdness, lawmakers didn't want to do it and did want anyone else to do it eihter. All laws are based upon that mentality. \n\n \n I always thought laws were based upon the desire to prevent actions that were harmful to individuals or society as a whole, not on what the lawmaker's likes and dislikes (prejudices) were.\n \n \nIt doesn't allow for my desires to determine my rights.\n\n \n How are your rights affected, let alone impeded, by gay marriage?\n \n Waxy",

But 52% of Americans in another Gallup poll last month said that they think homosexuality is morally wrong.\n \n Gallup Polls indicate that about 6 out of 10 American adults approve of the idea that homosexual relations between consenting adults should be legal.  This represents a significant change in attitudes over time; as recently as 1988, a clear majority felt gay and lesbian relations should be illegal. \n \n Those most likely to continue to believe that homosexual relations should be outlawed include people who attend church regularly, older Americans, those with lower levels of education, and Americans living in the South and in rural areas.\n \n A May Gallup Poll also asked about the morality of homosexuality (along with a list of a number of other behaviors and actions). \n \n In the May survey, a slight majority of Americans said that homosexual behavior should not be considered morally acceptable \n",

   "THere are homsexuals that try to recruit as well. Also there are gays that have changed and were not paid. These anti-gay sites you read have no basis. They are very hateful anit-exgay and anti- Christian sites. How can you consider these impartial?\n\n \n Well, here's an article from the Guardian than...\n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1183596,00.html\n Besen's book begins with an incident the author was barely able to believe when it happened. Newsweek magazine ran a cover story in 1998 about John and Anne Paulk, formerly gay but blissfully married. The Paulks were the poster boy and girl of a national ad campaign splashing across the American media that summer, funded by Christian ex-gay ministries. One night two years later, Besen received a call from a friend in a Washington DC gay bar. Guess who was there, chatting him up? John Paulk. Besen raced there, photographed Paulk, and has been persecuting the ex-gay movement ever since. He ticks off the victories on his fingers: of the four male stars of the 1998 ad campaign thus far, he says, Paulk has been caught, another outed himself and a third was discovered last summer taking part in a men-only orgy. \n \n \"I have never,\" says Besen in a slow Florida drawl, \"met a single person I believe has changed. I've met a few people who've changed their behaviour - but not their orientation. The founder of every single ex-gay ministry has failed. All of them have failed.\" \n \n Anything But Straight catalogues an astonishingly long list of ex-gays who became ex-ex-gays. There are counsellors caught giving nude massages to the men they are meant to be curing, and founders of ministries who fall in love and run off with each other. The stories are tragicomic, and in each the same cycle repeats: a honeymoon period of euphoria - I'm cured! - followed by the discovery that nothing has changed. \n \n But the author does not find any of it funny. The book's prosecution case builds angrily, until so much damning evidence has amassed that no serious scientific organisation could, you would think, conceivably stand up for the ex-gay movement. Why would Narth defend anything with so flawed a record? \n \n \"Because,\" claims Besen, \"the whole secular, scientific thing is a front. Dr Nicolosi is a fundamentalist Catholic, a religious fanatic disguising himself as a secular therapist. The vast majority of these therapists come from a religious background.\" Narth, he says, uses cod psychology to justify Christian homophobia. \"Exodus International, the biggest ex-gay ministry in the world, promotes Nicolosi as a therapist to go to. He is the religious right! Narth is the religious right.\" In other words, sexual reorientation is nothing more than a fantasy born of Christian wishful thinking. \n \n But if that is the case, how do we account for Dr Robert Spitzer? A heterosexual atheist humanist, Spitzer undertook his study on nothing more than a hunch. At the outset, he thought it highly unlikely that anyone could change their sexual orientation. Yet he came to the conclusion that homosexuality was a treatable condition. When he announced that, for certain \"highly motivated\" homosexuals, change \"was possible\", the US media went berserk. \"Can gays go straight? Yes - if they really want to!\" exclaimed headlines. The ex-gay movement was jubilant. Gay activists were stunned. But as details of the study emerged, their incredulity turned to anger. \n \n It had taken Spitzer more than 18 months to find just 200 or so people willing to describe themselves as successfully converted. He found his interviewees by advertising through ex-gay organisations. Almost half were recruited through ex-gay ministries, and nearly a quarter by Narth. Religion was \"extremely\" or \"very\" important to 93% of them. One in five was a mental health professional (Cohen, for example, is a high-profile reparative therapist) or director of an ex-gay ministry, and more than three-quarters had previously lobbied for sexual reorientation. These are people who get paid to say that therapy works. \n \n For many critics, this alone was enough to discredit the exercise. An article in the APA's Psychiatric News likened it to testing a drug on people recruited by the pharmaceutical company. But in addition, many of the participants appeared to have been not so much altered from gay to straight, as bisexual all along. Ten per cent of the men had never had gay sex before therapy, whereas half had already slept with a woman. Only a third of the women and half the men said that before therapy they were \"extremely\" bothered by homosexual feelings. How gay were they? \n \n As with most statistics, everything depends on how they are read. The percentage who were \"extremely bothered\" by homosexual feelings after undergoing therapy fell to zero. You could say zero was a sensational turnaround; or you might say they weren't so gay in the first place. Two New York psychologists carried out another study of reparative therapy at the same time as Spitzer, and reached the opposite conclusion. \"We interviewed 182 people who tried very hard to change,\" Dr Ariel Shidlo told Newsweek. \"The stakes were really high for them. Some really thought that if they didn't change, they would literally find themselves in hell... And they still failed.\" \n \n \"Spitzer?\" Besen says. \"I just don't understand the man. I told him, if there is one thing we know about these people, it is that when they say they've changed, they haven't.\" He shrugs, as though worn out with disbelief. \"C'mon. He had John Paulk in his study, for chrissakes.\" \n \n Spitzer sounds fairly worn out as well. \"If I were in my 30s,\" he says drily, \"this is not something I would advise somebody to do. It would not advance their career.\" He has been condemned as a bigot, and claimed as a cheerleader by the religious right. Wary of misrepresentation, he tries to clarify once again the purpose of his study, and what he believes it proved. It was very straightforward, he sighs. The received scientific wisdom was that sexual orientation never changed. He found people who said theirs had. He asked them questions designed to test their credibility, and found that for a significant number it had changed to a significant degree. \n \n \"Yes, I think change is probably extremely rare, otherwise it would not have taken so long to find the participants. And, yes, the change I found was seldom from one extreme to the other. But nevertheless, there was change. And that seems to me to be a worthwhile discovery, isn't it?\" \n \n No one has ever tested the efficacy of gay affirmative therapy, Spitzer points out. If clients told a researcher that it had worked for them, would we disbelieve them? No. When a homosexual says he was emotionally damaged by reparative therapy, gay activists do not doubt his word. \n \n \"So,\" Spitzer asks, patiently and deliberately, \"why assume he is lying when he says it helped?\" \n \n Spitzer's argument is simple, but quite sophisticated and persuasive. Even the most limited change would disprove the assumption that change was never possible - and that would indeed be interesting. But there is a crucial flaw in all ex-gay representations, and unwittingly Spitzer exposes it in his final comment. \"Some people have suggested I ought to do a follow-up study.\" The idea would be to see if anyone had fallen off the wagon. \"But if you were doing an evaluation of the treatment of cocaine addiction, say, and someone had a relapse, you wouldn't say that the treatment was of no value, would you?\" \n \n You would not. But there is a crucial distinction here, one that undermines the analogy Nicolosi and others frequently like to draw between ex-gays and addicts. A recovering alcoholic will always be an alcoholic; successful treatment can only sustain his willpower. But to suggest an ex-gay can \"relapse\" implies that sexual reorientation is only ever a triumph of willpower, never a conversion of authentic desire. \n \n Ultimately, everything must come down to what we mean by sexual reorientation. But when I ask Nicolosi to define success, he seems surprisingly unconcerned, as though this were a rarefied detail. \"Good question,\" he says airily. \"Would you consider success,\" he muses, \"a man who, OK, acted out four times a week at the beginning of therapy and now acts out once a month? Somewhat. Not great. OK, not great. Not no change, but not great.\" \n \n Not great at all. And where is his interest in women? \n \n Nicolosi sighs. \"You see, sexual reorientation, half of it is to get rid of same-sex attraction. The other half is hopefully opposite-sex attraction. Most clients just can't imagine being attracted to women. A lot of them say, I just want to stop being attracted to guys. And, hey, that is a workable treatment.\" \n \n But isn't attraction to women supposed to follow on automatically? \n \n \"I believe that, yes. We are sexual beings. If you shut off one door, you've got to open up another door, right? The trouble is, often my clients don't believe that.\" Nicolosi is beginning to sound glib. It transpires that by the time many clients complete therapy, attraction to women is still only the therapist's prediction, not the client's reality. And apparently it doesn't even need to come true. \n \n \"Using the general definition of cure,\" he continues, \"the diminishment of problematic behaviour is a cure. I would consider that a successful case.\" \n \n We seem to have travelled a long way from the radical claims being made so confidently on stage at Love Won Out. And we are about to depart even farther. \"Let's say,\" Nicolosi suddenly suggests, \"you work with a man for six months. Let's say he acts out once a week in the beginning, but when he acts out he tortures himself, beats himself up, thinks he's a pervert. After six months in therapy, he understands why he acts out. He's still acting out once a week, but it's more like a hollow ritual. He's not as upset with himself, he's more hopeful of change in the future. Now, his behaviour is still the same. Would you consider that a success?\" \n \n Would you? \n \n \"Yes,\" Nicolosi replies, \"I would consider that a success.\" Even the most successful ex-gay, he adds casually, is always going to have to keep an eye on himself, to make sure he \"doesn't fall\". \n \n But surely that is the opposite of inner change? It sounds closer to a definition of willpower. \n \n \"But he has changed! He's changed in the sense that, instead of living a gay lifestyle, he has a wife that he loves emotionally and sexually, and he has three kids, and his friends are married men. Isn't that a change? That's a change. He may still get a little same-sex titillation from time to time, sure, and he'd better be realistic about that. I mean, he's setting himself up for a fall if he really believes he won't. OK?\" \n \n Jake: Love that part where the ex-gay guru defines success as a gay man only acting out homosexually once a week, but at the same time having a wife and kids.\n \n \nSo I'm a bigot now? Thanks for showing how people that disagree with you are Christian bigots. I'm not a bigot.\n\n \n Just as long as gays are like straights, you can accept gays. How do they become like straights, if they are not extremely religious, like the biased activist samples(many bi-sexual) in the study which claimed some change was possible? \n \n \nAre you a bigot for opposing family values?\n\n \n Perhaps my family values include accepting gay family members.\n \n \nMine are fuzzy logics? Jake c'mon now. All your arguments are based upon bias speculation. If it's fuzzy maybe you need to change your glasses prescription.\n\n \n Your \"arguments\" on this topic get weaker and weaker by the post. Nothing but overly broad definitions and very bizarre red-herrings. \n \n \nI showed yout that homosexuality is outside the norm therefore it's deviant. That is broad statement because it cover many disorders.\n\n \n Indeed, it could cover vegetarian behaviour as well.\n \n \nTHe fact that the institution will be changed (becaue it will no longer be the same heterosexual institution)proves that it's integrity will be compromised. Res ipsa loquitor\n Now prove tht it won't.\n\n \n Okay, obviously changed. But to state that it's integrity will be compromised has a negative connotation. It could be changed in a positive or a neutral way.\n \n \nMarriage is to protect family if they do ahve children. If they don't then theya re still a family.\n\n \n And if they don't have children, is their marriage just as \"good\".",

Yes homosexuality has been around for as long as mankind. It however was not changed during Christianization of the island.\n \n There are a lot of research done by reasearchers that are not Tongan and do not speak the language.

   " Homosexuality is a behaviour? Yep, lots of people choose to be \"outcasts\" in society and discriminated against by people like yourself.

Is it becasue you don't want to or becasue you get your information off of anti-exgay sites?\n \n \n \n \n OK. So being unnatural is only part of your \"policy consideration\". What is the rest of your policy based on?\n\n Public interest. Social and economic considerations.\n \n \n \n \n You think the reason prostitution exists is due to nymphomania? Are you serious? Wow.\n\n No I'm saying prostitutes can use the excuse that they are nymphomaniacs to \"jusitfy\" their behavior. I mean they didn't choose to be that way.\n \n \n \n \n Please give me one concrete example of how homosexual marriage destroys the integrity of marriage, as defined by the state, and as it is implemented/used by the state. I don't care about the religious sacrament of marriage here, that's for each religion or figure out on its own.\n\n The fact that an institutions intergrity is based upon it's stability ( the fact it doesn't change standards). Compromising its standards degrades it's integrity.\n \n \n \n \n What does marriage law have to do with objectivity? Isn't the the fact that marriage is currently defined as a man and woman a subjective definition?\n\n No. Subjectivity is it applies to people through blind eyes. The law is definite and objective. It is no respecter of person.\n \n \n \n You have the right to marry who you choose to marry, homosexuals do not have that right. You just got lucky at birth and your right is recognized under current laws.\n\n yeah and that's the law. I was given the right by the law to marry a non-relative, adult single woman. I wasn't given a right to marry someone who I love. Heteros just happen to choose someone to marry that falls in that category based upon love.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n B.S.\n \n Don't tell me marriage is to create/protect families, if that were the case, marriages couldn't be undone by the stroke of a pen. That's a farce, and furthermore, it could just as easily be applied to any homosexual couple.\n\n Marriage is the considered the fundamental foundation upon which families are formed. Look it up in any family science text book.\n \n The fact that some marriages fail does mean that the family cease to exist. Accepting gays would change the definition of families and what would constitute a marriage.\n Marriages do protect families. protection of families continue even through divorce. The protection is there becasue of the marraige and the family structure. We receive rights of family through biology and or marriage. These rights survive through almost anything. Also there are laws that pertain to marriage made to protect and promote the interest of children and spouses. \n These laws are passed based upon the policy that families are an integral part of our society. We don't want to change the definition and the structure of society.\n \n \n \n \n Let me narrow it down further. What is the purpose of marriage laws as defined by the state? Are they in place to protect religious sanctity and morality, or are they in place to define the legal union of two people for the purposes of asset sharing and tax structure? \n\n The tax structure is in place becasue of marriage not the other way around. Marriage has existed before this country was formed. Marriages are in place because they are the foundation of our society, they build families. Families build communities and communities build societies.\n \n \n \n \n Marriage is simply contract law in the eyes of the state, any moral or social issues are irrelevent. It's all about money.\n\n Apparently not that is why they have so many laws pertaining to the social and moral safety of the laws.\n \n \n \n \n I always thought laws were based upon the desire to prevent actions that were harmful to individuals or society as a whole, not on what the lawmaker's likes and dislikes (prejudices) were.\n\n Keep thnking. Laws are made to promote and protect a public interest. We have laws that are made to effect all our social, physical, emotional, economical, and moral interests. Most laws do prevent harm because they look out for all our interests. lawmakers do have biases. That is why we celebrate Christmas and not Hannukah.\n \n \n \n How are your rights affected, let alone impeded, by gay marriage?\n \nNot my rights but the institution of marraige would be affected and many other laws.

   "Guys, I think we are all beginning to loose the big picture here. OK so the homosexual issue is a problem, but I think the real menace is even more insidious.\n \n Brittany Spears.\n \n Personally I think listening to Brittany Spears should be made illegal. And I have very good and unrefutable reasons.\n \n Firstly it degrades the music industry. The music industry is a fine, unblemished institution but Brittany Spears rejects all of it's values. It should not be allowed to preserve the integrity of our splendid industry.\n \n Secondly it is not natural. I see no sign as to anything in nature that listens to Brittany Spears.\n \n It is against God, after all Joshua 6:18 says \"And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it\". This is obviously a prophesy about Brittany Spears.\n \n Please note I am not against the belief that Brittany Spears is good. We can't regulate belief now people, that would just be silly. But we can and must regulate behaviour.Therefore it should only be people who actively listen to her records who will be arrested.\n \n These people choose to be Brittany Spears fans, it is not inherent. I personally know several people who used to like her, but have managed to repress this disgusting tendency and now lead normal lives. They have now fought the urge to put on 'Oops I did it again' down to only once a week or so, and have successfully ignored their terrible weakness.\n \n There is also strong evidence from the respected, impartial and objective group 'The Campaign For the Death of Brittany Spears and Mutilation of Her Body' that liking Brittany Spears is actually a psychological disorder and all who are afflicted by this terrible problem should be immediately institutionalised. And some of them have even been to university, so no doubt they know what they are talking about.\n \n I advocate the same rights for all. I am not allowed to listen to Brittany Spears, neither is a Brittany Spears fan. Same rights.\n \n It is in the public interest. I have seen a poll that said 51% of people didn't like Brittany Spears too much. That means that practically everyone must want her outlawed.",

   "THey do it becasue it's harder than forcing themselves to overcome a weakness. Serial killers, rapists, and pedophiles have the same problem. DO they choose to be that way?\n\n \n Unless we were to come to a conscensus on the \"cause\" of homosexuality, any further discussion on this is pointless.\n \n I think equating homosexuals with serial killers, rapists, and pedophiles is disgusting, and shows your true feelings on the subject. If one was not at least a little bit homophobic, one wouldn't use this line or reasoning, they'd see it for what it was.\n \n \nReligious propaganda?

Is it becasue you don't want to or becasue you get your information off of anti-exgay sites?\n\n \n Interesting, you know two reformed homosexuals. You must have a significant amount of interaction with the gay community then, based on a purely statistical viewpoint, which given your beliefs, I find hard to believe. Either that, or you must be a very rare person. \n \n I don't dismiss anything and everything \"religious\", however, anything with a religious source will obviously have a religious bias, just as any pro-gay website will. I base my belief on the fact I believe homosexuality is in fact a genetic condition, not a learned one. You can't undo your genes, but you can choose to live in denial.\n \n \nPublic interest. Social and economic considerations.\n\n \n Public interest. Interesting. Care to expand?\n \n Social considerations is somewhat valid. There will no doubt be some repercussions and a resulting adjustment of social attitudes. I fail to see how that's necessarily negative, or how any negative outweighs the potential positives, not only for the gay community, but for communities everywhere. I fail to see how two people forming a strong bond, legally recognized, and becoming active members of a community, is negative. A family does not have to have children to be a strong and positive influence on a community or society.\n \n Economic considerations such as what, tax benefits? Tax cuts lead to a stronger economy right?\n \n \nNo I'm saying prostitutes can use the excuse that they are nymphomaniacs to \"jusitfy\" their behavior. I mean they didn't choose to be that way.\n\n \n Have you ever, in your entire life, read, heard, or seen on TV a prostitute say they became a prostitute because they're a nymphomaniac? That's absurd. I'm having trouble reconciling that you actually believe that's the cause, or even A cause of prostitution. If so, it's an incredibly naieve belief.\n \n \nThe fact that an institutions intergrity is based upon it's stability ( the fact it doesn't change standards). Compromising its standards degrades it's integrity.\n\n \n Is it? Or is it also based on its ability to adapt and remain relevent? Is Harvard law school revered because its classes and curriculum are unchanged since it's founding, or is it revered because it takes that foundation and combines it with modern thought and relevence?\n \n Was the government of the USA, or democracy in general, degraded by allowing minorities and women to vote, or has it become even more relevent and viable?\n \n \nNo. Subjectivity is it applies to people through blind eyes. The law is definite and objective. It is no respecter of person. \n \n yeah and that's the law. I was given the right by the law to marry a non-relative, adult single woman. I wasn't given a right to marry someone who I love. Heteros just happen to choose someone to marry that falls in that category based upon love.\n\n \n How does subjectivity equal blind eyes? I realize you're the lawyer, but I don't believe for a minute that the law, as it was conceived and written, was purely objective. I realize that's the ideal, and I'd like to think it's application is objective, but even then, I can't agree to consistent objective application.\n \n \nMarriage is the considered the fundamental foundation upon which families are formed. Look it up in any family science text book.\n\n \n Does a family equal children? Can a family equal two people and their pets? How about two people, their pets, and all of their immediate and extended family? How does a couple being barren, or incapable of having children make them less of a family? Should heterosexuals incapable of reproduction be prohibited from marrying?\n \n \nThe fact that some marriages fail does mean that the family cease to exist. Accepting gays would change the definition of families and what would constitute a marriage.\n Marriages do protect families. protection of families continue even through divorce.

We don't want to change the definition and the structure of society.\n\n \n How does current marriage law protect families post divorce other than in monetary ways - ie division of property, child support, alimony, etc... \n \n Visitation rights does come to mind, but that's a whole new thread.\n \n Again, does a marriage have to equal children to be valid? I'm also very unclear on what laws you're referring to that \"protect and promote the interest of children and spouses\".\n \n Correction - YOU don't want to change it.\n \n \nThe tax structure is in place becasue of marriage not the other way around. Marriage has existed before this country was formed. Marriages are in place because they are the foundation of our society, they build families. Families build communities and communities build societies.\n\n \n Chicken and egg, circular logic.\n \n Again, family = children?\n \n \nKeep thnking.

Most laws do prevent harm because they look out for all our interests. lawmakers do have biases.

Interesting.\n \n I posted this - \"I always thought laws were based upon the desire to prevent actions that were harmful to individuals or society as a whole\"\n \n The above quote is your smart *** response. How is preventing harm to individuals/society different than promoting/protecting the public interest? If you gave me one or two concrete examples, not broad speculations, of how allowing gay marriage would be harmful to society, I'd be forced to consider the ban as being reasonable.\n \n \nNot my rights but the institution of marraige would be affected and many other laws. I don't believe our desires or behavior should determine our rights.\n\n \n It doesn't directly affect you or your rights, you just stated that, but your belief that it might have a negative affect on the \"institution of marriage\" is sufficient for you to deny someone else happiness and equality. IMHO, that's sad.\n \n Then what do you believe should determine our rights?\n \n I think it's just about time we put this one to bed. It's getting more and more circular and we aren't getting anywhere, not that I expected we would.\n Overall, your responses are becoming more and more vague and evasive, I ask you for concrete examples or definitions and you supply/rehash broad generalizations or speculation. Quite frankly, I'm finding this very frustrating, all I ask for is some straight answers. As a law student, I would assume you would be able to supply this to my rather pointed questions on the law. If we can't get into some details, and you aren't willing to put your personal beliefs on the table, then what's the point?\n \n Waxy",

   "I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different. I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important, ancient institution requires some heavy justification. People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling.\n\n \n Yes, the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time. However, simply because something is traditional does not make it just. \n \n \nI for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for, in order so the gay community can prove something.\n\n \n Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community. You see it as \"them\" trying to step out of their lower place, or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value. Your last comment I've dealt with in this post, demonstrates that very well. \n \n \nTired argument?!\n\n \n Yes, the backlash threat is tired and boring. No one is listening anymore.\n \n \nMy god, how long have we been debating gay marriage? Only four or five years ago in grad school, we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples, and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions.

   "Guys, I think we are all beginning to loose the big picture here. OK so the homosexual issue is a problem, but I think the real menace is even more insidious.\n \n Brittany Spears.\n \n Personally I think listening to Brittany Spears should be made illegal. And I have very good and unrefutable reasons.\n \n Firstly it degrades the music industry. The music industry is a fine, unblemished institution but Brittany Spears rejects all of it's values. It should not be allowed to preserve the integrity of our splendid industry.\n \n Secondly it is not natural. I see no sign as to anything in nature that listens to Brittany Spears.\n \n It is against God, after all Joshua 6:18 says \"And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it\". This is obviously a prophesy about Brittany Spears.\n \n Please note I am not against the belief that Brittany Spears is good. We can't regulate belief now people, that would just be silly. But we can and must regulate behaviour.Therefore it should only be people who actively listen to her records who will be arrested.\n \n These people choose to be Brittany Spears fans, it is not inherent. I personally know several people who used to like her, but have managed to repress this disgusting tendency and now lead normal lives. They have now fought the urge to put on 'Oops I did it again' down to only once a week or so, and have successfully ignored their terrible weakness.\n \n There is also strong evidence from the respected, impartial and objective group 'The Campaign For the Death of Brittany Spears and Mutilation of Her Body' that liking Brittany Spears is actually a psychological disorder and all who are afflicted by this terrible problem should be immediately institutionalised. And some of them have even been to university, so no doubt they know what they are talking about.\n \n I advocate the same rights for all. I am not allowed to listen to Brittany Spears, neither is a Brittany Spears fan. Same rights.\n \n It is in the public interest. I have seen a poll that said 51% of people didn't like Brittany Spears too much. That means that practically everyone must want her outlawed.\n\n Good thinking phunting. I actually think Britney's music is whacked. The analogy is very different in many aspects.\n \n First comparing behavior.\n Choice of music is different than choice to listen or not to listen to music.\n We are not saying who to listen to that is your choice. We are saying that it's either you listen to music and we will not infringe on the right to listen to music but we will stop you if you want the radio station to play all the music backwards as well. That the music can be forward but it need to be backwards because we find that much more appealing and we want everyone to have it on the radio as well because we want it.",

   " Unless we were to come to a conscensus on the \"cause\" of homosexuality, any further discussion on this is pointless.\n \n I think equating homosexuals with serial killers, rapists, and pedophiles is disgusting, and shows your true feelings on the subject. If one was not at least a little bit homophobic, one wouldn't use this line or reasoning, they'd see it for what it was.\n\n Well then it's pointless unless you agree it's not genetic.\n \n I never equated gays to serial killers or anything else. I was saying that when people have urges that aren't \"acceptable\" or in the norm that they should practice some self control that we expect people wiht other disorders to behave. Waht standard can we make that would make gays to not refrain from their urges but for every other disorder to refrain from theirs? THanks anyways for jumping on the homophobic bandwagon.\n \n \n \n\n Interesting, you know two reformed homosexuals. You must have a significant amount of interaction with the gay community then, based on a purely statistical viewpoint, which given your beliefs, I find hard to believe. Either that, or you must be a very rare person. \n \n I don't dismiss anything and everything \"religious\", however, anything with a religious source will obviously have a religious bias, just as any pro-gay website will. I base my belief on the fact I believe homosexuality is in fact a genetic condition, not a learned one. You can't undo your genes, but you can choose to live in denial.\n\n I have various relatives taht are gay. I also have one uncle and an girl I dated that are both ex-gays (although I still wished the girl would experiment wiht other women in front of me or at least include me in the action..just playing)\n \n My sister and a few girls I dated are flight attendants. Most male flight attendants it seems are gay. So they have had various gay roommates. So I've gotten to know my share. We can kick it and they know I'm down wiht them DESPITE the fact that they are gay. They know how I feel and so do my relatives. \n \n So any agnostic or atheist source doesn't have a bias? There is fact from non-religious sites that support that it is not genetic. THere is also nothing \"DEFINITIVE\" to suggest that it is genetic just mere hypothesies and speculation.\n \n \n \n \n\n Public interest. Interesting. Care to expand?\n \n Social considerations is somewhat valid. There will no doubt be some repercussions and a resulting adjustment of social attitudes. I fail to see how that's necessarily negative, or how any negative outweighs the potential positives, not only for the gay community, but for communities everywhere. I fail to see how two people forming a strong bond, legally recognized, and becoming active members of a community, is negative. A family does not have to have children to be a strong and positive influence on a community or society.\n \n Economic considerations such as what, tax benefits? Tax cuts lead to a stronger economy right?\n\n Public interest is defined as the \"safety, health, and moral welfare\".\n \n Public interest, social and economic considerations are what lawmakers consider when making laws. They pass laws that incorporate at least one of these considerations.\n \n Families do not have to have children to be a family. I feel that a family is a result of a marriage or shared ancestry or descendants.\n \n \n \n\n Have you ever, in your entire life, read, heard, or seen on TV a prostitute say they became a prostitute because they're a nymphomaniac? That's absurd. I'm having trouble reconciling that you actually believe that's the cause, or even A cause of prostitution. If so, it's an incredibly naieve belief.\n\n WAxy you're missing the point. I was focusing and ilustrating how people can use their disorders (such as homosexuality) to justify theri behavior. Sorry I'll be more specific.\n \n \n \n\n Is it? Or is it also based on its ability to adapt and remain relevent? Is Harvard law school revered because its classes and curriculum are unchanged since it's founding, or is it revered because it takes that foundation and combines it with modern thought and relevence?\n \n Was the government of the USA, or democracy in general, degraded by allowing minorities and women to vote, or has it become even more relevent and viable?\n\n Curriculum doesn't equal standards. Standards can remain high while curriculum changes.\n \n It wasn't really a democracy when it depends on the will of the people and yet the will of the people was disenfranchised.\n \n \n \n\n How does subjectivity equal blind eyes? I realize you're the lawyer, but I don't believe for a minute that the law, as it was conceived and written, was purely objective. I realize that's the ideal, and I'd like to think it's application is objective, but even then, I can't agree to consistent objective application.\n\n The law is written based upon the person and their intent. Marriage laws were not based upon feelings. They don't make people prove that they are in love. So there is no law that gives the right to marry based upon love. It merely gives the right based upon current marital status, blood relation, and age.\n \n \n \n \n\n Does a family equal children? Can a family equal two people and their pets? How about two people, their pets, and all of their immediate and extended family? How does a couple being barren, or incapable of having children make them less of a family? Should heterosexuals incapable of reproduction be prohibited from marrying?\n\n Families don't have to have children. i defined it above. If a marriage happens it's a family (husband and wife). The minimum is shared genetic ancestry or descendants or marriage. Majority don't want to consider two husbands a family.\n \n \n \n\n How does current marriage law protect families post divorce other than in monetary ways - ie division of property, child support, alimony, etc... \n \n Visitation rights does come to mind, but that's a whole new thread.\n \n Again, does a marriage have to equal children to be valid? I'm also very unclear on what laws you're referring to that \"protect and promote the interest of children and spouses\".\n \n Correction - YOU don't want to change it.\n\n Current marriage laws give standing to anyone invovled or part of a marriage.

Interesting.\n \n I posted this - \"I always thought laws were based upon the desire to prevent actions that were harmful to individuals or society as a whole\"\n \n The above quote is your smart *** response. How is preventing harm to individuals/society different than promoting/protecting the public interest? If you gave me one or two concrete examples, not broad speculations, of how allowing gay marriage would be harmful to society, I'd be forced to consider the ban as being reasonable.\n\n I pointed out biases. Do republicans and democrats have biases? Do they pass laws based upon those biases?\n It would change the definition of a family. It also would degrade the institution by lessing the standard to be a part of it.\n \n \n \n\n It doesn't directly affect you or your rights, you just stated that, but your belief that it might have a negative affect on the \"institution of marriage\" is sufficient for you to deny someone else happiness and equality. IMHO, that's sad.\n \n Then what do you believe should determine our rights?\n \n I think it's just about time we put this one to bed. It's getting more and more circular and we aren't getting anywhere, not that I expected we would.\n Overall, your responses are becoming more and more vague and evasive, I ask you for concrete examples or definitions and you supply/rehash broad generalizations or speculation. Quite frankly, I'm finding this very frustrating, all I ask for is some straight answers. As a law student, I would assume you would be able to supply this to my rather pointed questions on the law. If we can't get into some details, and you aren't willing to put your personal beliefs on the table, then what's the point? \n\n AGain they have equality. The happiness argument is so subjective. Imagine if we had to accommodate everyone's desires to make them happy. I'm based my argument on the public interest.\n \n Why do you need my personl beliefs? How would that bolster my argument? I'll tell you anything you want.\n \n I don't believe homosexuality is genetic. In fact I know it's not.\n \n I believe that marriage is sacred and that people do revere it as it should be.

I was saying that when people have urges that aren't \"acceptable\" or in the norm that they should practice some self control that we expect people wiht other disorders to behave. Waht standard can we make that would make gays to not refrain from their urges but for every other disorder to refrain from theirs? THanks anyways for jumping on the homophobic bandwagon.\n\n \n The standard of one urges being harmful to others. Again, the correlation is disgusting IMHO. I call them as I see them.\n \n \nI have various relatives taht are gay. I also have one uncle and an girl I dated that are both ex-gays (although I still wished the girl would experiment wiht other women in front of me or at least include me in the action..just playing)\n \n My sister and a few girls I dated are flight attendants. Most male flight attendants it seems are gay. So they have had various gay roommates. So I've gotten to know my share. We can kick it and they know I'm down wiht them DESPITE the fact that they are gay. They know how I feel and so do my relatives. \n \n \n Sounds like George Costanza listing all his \"black friends\".

I see none.\n \n \nThe law is written based upon the person and their intent. Marriage laws were not based upon feelings. They don't make people prove that they are in love. So there is no law that gives the right to marry based upon love. It merely gives the right based upon current marital status, blood relation, and age.\n\n \n Agreed, the state could care less about love as far as marriage is concerned. \n \n Then why the man/woman designation? \n \n \nFamilies don't have to have children. i defined it above. If a marriage happens it's a family (husband and wife). The minimum is shared genetic ancestry or descendants or marriage. Majority don't want to consider two husbands a family\n.\n \n See above. By your definition, two husbands IS a family.\n \n \nCurrent marriage laws give standing to anyone invovled or part of a marriage. Any person is allowed rights of children in hospitals if they were part of a marriage , even step children. Even after divorce they still can claim that privledge.\n\n \n Help paying hospital bills? That's it?

   "Mana'ia, have you ever thought about what it must be like to be a homosexual in today's society? All of the harmful stereotypes, the negativity exhibited by the religious right towards them, the trauma of coming out... Do you actually think that people CHOOSE to put themselves through that? The anguish that you are letting down your family, that you will always be known as 'different' and 'funny'... I cannot bring myself to believe that any sound person would put themselves through all of that. My gay friends who I know well have told me about all of their pain and confusion. If anything, that proved to me more than anything that homosexuality is not a choice. My best friend is a lesbian, and everday she'd ask me, \"Why?\" Her parents dislike her now because she decided to be gay. She has endured so much pain and trauma for something that she could not help. And what really gets my goat is the fact that people still make it their business to make these people's lives even harder, in that they seek to prevent them from marrying the people that they love, the people with whom they have found their acceptance. Ask yourself, Who am I to tell these people that they are not allowed to marry the person that they love? For what reasons am I preventing their being together?

   "Yes,\n \n 1) It's against Gods Law-an Abomination.\n\n \n What about the other laws of God? Here is an article which has been posted a lot on the internet...\n \n Open Letter To 'Dr.' Laura\n Laura Schlessinger is a US radio personality who dispenses sex advice to people who call in to her radio show. Recently, she said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned in any circumstance. The following is an open letter to 'Dr.' Laura penned by a US resident, which was posted on the Internet:\n \n Dear Dr. Laura:\n Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your radio show, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.\n \n I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific Bible laws and how to follow them. \n a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? \n b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? She's 18 and starting University. Will the slave buyer continue to pay for her education by law? \n c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. I'm sure you have found a way to do this and can share it with me.\n d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should this be a neighborhood improvement project?\n f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here? Would contact lenses help?\n h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die?\n i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear hemp gloves?\n j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)\n I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.\n Your devoted disciple and adoring fan,\n J. Kent Ashcroft (author of the original version)\n \n There are so many contraditions in the Bible. Yet some people still call it the inerrant word of God. Be sure to scroll down to both question and answer charts. It's worth reading the whole article if you have time...\n \n http://atheism.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infidels.org%2Flibrary%2Fmodern%2Ftheodore_drange%2Fbible.html \n \n \n2) God loves the gay people but hates the Sin- there is help- I can get any gay person in contact with someone who used to be gay and has been set free and he will be willing to help, just let me know and i will get his websight to you and his phone number if you like.\n\n \n No thanks. There are other ways to meet dates. It's very easy for gays to meet dates that are not officially gay.",

The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? \n b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? She's 18 and starting University. Will the slave buyer continue to pay for her education by law? \n c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. I'm sure you have found a way to do this and can share it with me.\n d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should this be a neighborhood improvement project?\n f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here? Would contact lenses help?\n h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die?\n i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear hemp gloves?\n j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)\n I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.\n Your devoted disciple and adoring fan,\n J. Kent Ashcroft (author of the original version)\n \n There are so many contraditions in the Bible. Yet some people still call it the inerrant word of God. Be sure to scroll down to both question and answer charts. It's worth reading the whole article if you have time...\n \n http://atheism.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infidels.org%2Flibrary%2Fmodern%2Ftheodore_drange%2Fbible.html \n\n \n There are discrepancies in the bible due to translation errors. If there ahd existed a printing press in the beginning there wouldn't be those errors. Science has changed as well. How many times has science changed it's theories? Does that mean it's unreliable?\n \n Also using Old testament is really weak. That was the law of moses. Here is what another prophet said of the law of moses. \n MOS:13-29 And now I say unto you that it was expedient that there should be a law given to the children of Israel, yea, even a very strict\u0095 law; for they were a stiffnecked people, quick\u0095 to do iniquity, and slow to remember the Lord their God;\n \n 30 Therefore there was a law\u0095 given them, yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe\u0095 strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and their duty towards him.\n \n That was the purpose of the law. They had be under sch strict scrutiny all the time to avoid them falling into iniquity.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n No thanks. There are other ways to meet dates. It's very easy for gays to meet dates that are not officially gay. \n\n Yeah there you go. If they are exgays then they're hiding it. Then if they return to it then you go into see it doesn't work. If they remain striaight then it's they were never really gay. Talk about biases.\n \n Just out of curiosity jake are you gay?",

That if you put anything before Him then you are not worthy of Him as the above peopel had done when invited to dinner.\n\n \n The verse does not state it was referring to a different verse in a different book. You are making your own subjective judgments about context, which is not a literal interpretation. I could just as easily interpret hating your family, made it easier to foresake them and have everlasting life and rich rewards in another verse.\n \n \n \nMatt 10:37 He that aloveth father or mother more\u0095 than me is not worthy of me: and he that cloveth\u0095 son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\n \n Matt 10\n \n 32 Whosoever therefore shall aconfess\u0095 me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.\n \n 33 But whosoever shall adeny\u0095 me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.\n \n 34 Think not that I am come to send apeace\u0095 on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\n \n 35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.\n \n 36 And a man's afoes shall be they of his own bhousehold\u0095.\n \n 37 He that aloveth father or mother bmore\u0095 than me is not worthy of me: and he that cloveth\u0095 son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\n \n 38 And he that taketh not his across\u0095, and followeth after me, is not bworthy of me.\n \n 39 aHe\u0095 that findeth his life shall blose\u0095 it: and he that closeth\u0095 his dlife for my sake shall find it.\n \n 40 \u00b6 He that areceiveth\u0095 you breceiveth\u0095 me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.\n \n \n THis scripture is meant that His gospel will not be easy to live. That there would be problems even from within your family because of their belief in Him. The gospel does not allow for fence sitters. There will be a time when you need to decide between Him and His gospel.\n\n \n And between him and your family. I have no interest in taking up a sword against my mother or father under any circumstance. Because my own family may have different beliefs, that does not make them my foes. If you hate your family, you don't love them more than Jesus anyway.",

All of the harmful stereotypes, the negativity exhibited by the religious right towards them, the trauma of coming out... Do you actually think that people CHOOSE to put themselves through that? The anguish that you are letting down your family, that you will always be known as 'different' and 'funny'... I cannot bring myself to believe that any sound person would put themselves through all of that. My gay friends who I know well have told me about all of their pain and confusion. If anything, that proved to me more than anything that homosexuality is not a choice. My best friend is a lesbian, and everday she'd ask me, \"Why?\" Her parents dislike her now because she decided to be gay. She has endured so much pain and trauma for something that she could not help. And what really gets my goat is the fact that people still make it their business to make these people's lives even harder, in that they seek to prevent them from marrying the people that they love, the people with whom they have found their acceptance. Ask yourself, Who am I to tell these people that they are not allowed to marry the person that they love? For what reasons am I preventing their being together? And what harm would it do to me/others if they do marry?\n\n I can sympathize with problems of gays. It would seem that it is genetic becasue they do not overcome their problems that they do not want. I'm not saying that they are equal but many others have problems overcoming like kelptomaniacs, pyromaniacs, pedohiles, and many others. The obvious difference is the harm factor.

THere is nothing genetic that forces us to be gay.\n\n \n Homosexuality has been observed in nature. What's more the human hetero male is one of the few animals who is attracted to the female at all times, not just when she is fertile. Our sex is not just for reproduction. If a person has one or two children, that person has plenty of opportunities to have sex, not just one or two opportunities. There are also many different forms of sex for heteros which allow no possible opportunity for reproduction in their natural form. There are heterosexuals who never reproduce.\n \n The idea that heterosexuality is more \"normal\" or natural or genetic, meaning in itself and in any form it can take, meaning it is more \"good\" is really a leap of faith.\n \n Also, not all animals reproduce.

   "John\n \n 1 AND the athird\u0095 day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:\n \n 2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.\n \n 3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.\n \n 4 Jesus saith unto her, aWoman\u0095, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.\n \n 5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.\n \n 6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the apurifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.\n \n 7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.\n \n 8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.\n \n 9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,\n \n The scripture again taken out of context. Mary came to Christ to ask about What should be done about the wine. Then Christ's response was \"Jesus saith unto her, aWoman\u0095, what have I to do with thee?\" which means Woman, what wilt thou have me to do for thee? that will I do; for mine hour is not yet come. This is better illustrated in the SPanish and German translations of the gospel according to John.\n\n \n No. He wasn't saying what would you like me to do for you, after she had already came to him with the specific problem of the lack of booze. He responded rudely to being complained to about the lack of alcohol. \n \n \n \nMatt 8\n 18 \u00b6 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.\n \n 19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will afollow\u0095 thee whithersoever thou goest.\n \n 20 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\n \n 21 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer\u0095 me first to go and bury my father.\n \n 22 But Jesus said unto him, aFollow me; and let the dead bury their dead.\n \n This is refernce to disciples committing to follow Him. He merely was stating that their first responsibility was to Him. That it was figurative to the dead bury the dead. Thanks for manipulating it though.\n\n \n What in the heck did I manipulate? I quoted again. Yes, their responsibility is to Jesus. Honoring your own deceased father with a decent and respectful burial doesn't matter.

Even when drunk I would still not do anything with a guy, my reasons for getting out of kissing him or doing anything with him would simply get worse.\n\n I can imagine your pain. I'm sorry. I'm going to use this analogy only as a reference. I'm not insinuating that homosexuality is equivalent to anything only on the smae parallel.\n \n You struggle with things like poeple struggle with other disorders.

Public nudity is only harmful if it is below fourty degrees outside. Parking asking a religious question is not harmful if the information isn't used. Running a red light without other cars is harmful only if there are pedestrians.\n\n So prostitution isn't harmful to the girls that are pimped by their boyfriends? it sin't harmful to the prostitutes that sleep with other husbands? public nudity isn't harmful to school girls when they're flashed by a big hairy fat guy? Asking a religious question isn't harmful if they don't use it but yet it casts a slight bias already upon the interview? Running a red light isn't harmful when no one else is around but you keep thinking that there isn't and one time you misjudge things.\n \n There is harm and policy reasons in every law.

   " Homosexuality has been observed in nature. What's more the human hetero male is one of the few animals who is attracted to the female at all times, not just when she is fertile. Our sex is not just for reproduction. If a person has one or two children, that person has plenty of opportunities to have sex, not just one or two opportunities. There are also many different forms of sex for heteros which allow no possible opportunity for reproduction in their natural form. There are heterosexuals who never reproduce.\n\n Homosexuality in nature is also considered a disorder. \n I don't know why you don't think about your assertions before you make them. In the animal kingdom animals do things more routinely and more consistently than humans. Just because they only mate during mating seasons and don't respond to females in certain situations doesn't mean that they are not attracted to them. There is only correllary(sp?) indications that they do not respond to women making them seem unattractive. Men and children don't always react to women that they are attracted to as well. Also women are fertile from as early as age 12 to as late as 45. The only time they are not fertile is when they are on their period and when they are menstrating.\n \n Sex is natural between a male and female. Humans many times react less and less when stimuli is very monotonous. So that is why there is an urge to try different sexual stimulations.When women are sexuallly stimulated and men too there is better chances of mating.\n \n When heterosexuals can't reproduce then they have some genetic problem. When they choose not to reproduce then they are jsut defying the nature of their genetics. It's still genetic and it will propel itself even \"darwinsim\" supports that.\n \n \n \n \n The idea that heterosexuality is more \"normal\" or natural or genetic, meaning in itself and in any form it can take, meaning it is more \"good\" is really a leap of faith.\n\n I can't even understand how you can consider homosexuality as even clsoe to normal. There is nothing genetic to it and it wouldn't serve a purpsoe in nature excpet under darwinism to kill off the \"weaker\" offspring.\n \n \n \n Also, not all animals reproduce. In kin selection, an animal will not reproduce. However, the animal will help its family and therefore its own shared genes by defending, hunting for food, and by reducing violent competition for females.\n \n\n Almost all animals reproduce. Usually it doesn't reproduce in nature becasue it's considered an inferior specimen and it doesn't want to be promulgated.\n \n \n \n Of course not, but it doesn't mean they should not \"continue down that path.\"\n \n\n Why?\n \n \n \n Actually I was just rejecting those kinds of generalizations about cultures, including black culture.\n\n Well I thought you saying insinuating about gay lifestyle.\n \n \n \n \n \n Beliefs are a mental condition. Not necessarily a diseased condition, nor is homosexuality a diseased condition. \n\n Beliefs are not a condition.\n \n Condition\n a : a state of being  b : social status : RANK c : a usually defective state of health <a serious heart condition< d : a state of physical fitness or readiness for use  <the car was in good condition< <exercising to get into condition< e plural : attendant circumstances\n \n Since we control our beliefs then it can't be a state of being. We think a way but are not in that state.\n \n \n \n \n \n Not in an unbiased sample that can be generalized to all gay and lesbian people, and which also has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. \n\n Did you ever think that because the psychiatric field politically motivated to condone homosexuality? They always refer to people that disagre with homosexuality as homophobic or bias. There is no support or extensive reasearch done that is sanctioned by their agenda.\n \n Also don't you wonder if there is no way to change something that is chosen. Therapy can't change something that someone chooses not to do. Just as rehad only works if people are willing to make the sacrifices and effort to change.",

There is no reason for an animal to not respond when it is sexually attracted.\n \n \nSex is natural between a male and female.\n\n \n Yadda, yadda, yadda.\n \n \nHumans many times react less and less when stimuli is very monotonous. So that is why there is an urge to try different sexual stimulations.When women are sexuallly stimulated and men too there is better chances of mating.\n\n \n What if a hetero couple only like \"different\" sexual stimulations? What if the hetero couple only did the wide diversity that couldn't lead to reproduction? \n \n \nWhen heterosexuals can't reproduce then they have some genetic problem. When they choose not to reproduce then they are jsut defying the nature of their genetics. It's still genetic and it will propel itself even \"darwinsim\" supports that.\n\n \n So what? If something can appear to be genetic, or it is proven it has a gene for it, that does not make it good or bad in itself. If someone merely naturally reproduces as a heterosexual, does that mean they are capable of providing a good family environment which will help its offspring survive and thrive for example? So what if the heterosexuals are defying the nature of their genetics? You believe gay people are all really straight too, so those gay people are just defying their genetics like the heterosexuals who don't reproduce. \n \n \nI can't even understand how you can consider homosexuality as even clsoe to normal. There is nothing genetic to it and it wouldn't serve a purpsoe in nature excpet under darwinism to kill off the \"weaker\" offspring.\n\n \n There is nothing genetic to being a Christian, and having a Christian wedding either. One possible theory is the kin selection theory I already outlined. At any rate, I don't think humans are always slaves to what is biological. All our behaviours as humans are so incredibly diverse.\n \n \nAlmost all animals reproduce. Usually it doesn't reproduce in nature becasue it's considered an inferior specimen and it doesn't want to be promulgated.\n\n \n No. Do some research on kin selection.\n \n \n \nBeliefs are not a condition.\n \n Condition\n a : a state of being  b : social status : RANK c : a usually defective state of health <a serious heart condition< d : a state of physical fitness or readiness for use  <the car was in good condition< <exercising to get into condition< e plural : attendant circumstances\n \n Since we control our beliefs then it can't be a state of being. We think a way but are not in that state.\n\n \n You can put yourself into a state of being with your beliefs. One could say being gay is a belief one has that one should have sex with someone of the same sex.\n \n \nDid you ever think that because the psychiatric field politically motivated to condone homosexuality? They always refer to people that disagre with homosexuality as homophobic or bias. There is no support or extensive reasearch done that is sanctioned by their agenda.\n\n \n As if the right-wing \"ex-gay\" organizations don't have an agenda. Many are affiliated with other political groups that work against equal rights for gays. My anectdotal evidence tells me that many are clearly religiously addicted. I'm talking to one such person online right now who wants to die because he can't be straight as he believes God commands. He believes he will go to hell, but his life is a hell anyway, pressured into a marriage where he feels nothing for his wife. However, he believes God is keeping him in his miserable situation. He has very low self-esteem. Notice that the ex-gay organizations are made up of people who say religion is extremely important to them.\n \n \nso don't you wonder if there is no way to change something that is chosen. Therapy can't change something that someone chooses not to do. Just as rehad only works if people are willing to make the sacrifices and effort to change.\n\n \n I'm trying to get this person to see a therapist because of religious addiction before he risks killing himself. I honestly am not making this up.",

Then go along and when they hear about gay people they go well they shouldnt get married because its agianst religion or whatever.Now this doesnt count for everyone of course thats obvious. But ive seen that happen way more than once. Its even worse at school. People find out people are gay and they freak and treat the person with rudeness and as if they were an animal.\n If these people would just open thier eyes and see. We all have the same organs, we all have the skin etc etc. Yes i could understand if you disliked them because of thier personality but when you go and judge them and not speak to them or give them an attitude before you got to speak to them. It just shows your a \"wimp\" . People should have the right to do what they want and not have the goverment say no because of thier gender.

I am not doing what I am told I'm doing what I beleive is right. Tasty read my posts before you speak about what I have proven\n\n \n I have read your posts, all of them, at not one point have you proved anything like this, all you have done is spout doctrine of what you have been told to beleive by homophobes, even if you yourself do not hold the same gay hating views, you are still perpetuating them. Quote me an example of you 'proving' you relgious people arn't weak minded and I will apologise.\n \n \n \n \n\n Poeple are claiming that non-gays have the right to marry someone tehy love (which isn't true). I'm saying then others will claim that they have the right to work in the profession they love. That is how they are related\n There is quite a difference between being able to marry someone you love and enjoying a particular job, the nymphomania bit is still irrelevant as anyone could enjoy their job and there is massive negative effects with prostitution whcih their isn't for gay marriage. \n \n \n \n\n That's the best you can do is say calling me a homophobic? Wow. My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises. Marriage was created to promote and build families. By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity. Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable. Something that changes all the time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views. Things must remain consistent to be integral.\n Hardly the best, but best isn't really needed, however you are homophobic even if you don't like to call yourself it. So you beleive in changing nothing, well monarchy worked really well for a bit, as did tribal societies. Guess it would be really bad to change stuff like that otherwise government and leadership would lose all integrity (um..bad example really ;) ) same with medicines, far better to just pray to god for a cure rather than use drugs, at least the principle of healing people will still have integrity. Do you honestly beleive that more heterosexuals will get divorced if homosexual marriage is allowed, or people will stop caring for children?\n \n \n\n It isn't reasonable because it is a disorder and not promotive to the public interest. Also there is harm.\n\n It is in the publics interest, gays are part of the public and pretty much half the population are in favour of it (the flip side to your 50 or so percent saying gay marriage is wrong), and the other half is giving the same reasons as you...'I don't like it'. Where is the harm other than people refusing to accpet them (you don't support it because it can cause emotional problems because you won't accept them, because of the harm their beliefs cause from the emotional harm caused by...). It is not a mental disorder, and only things that have a definite negative effect actaully need to be overcome, things that are neutral do not need to be.\n \n Actually give some reasoning for your veiws rather than endless circular arguments- what negative effect will actually occur to people who don't participate in gay marriage, if gay marriage is official recognised?",

It may be more than they think they can do, but they can do it. People with other disorders such as those obsessed with trying to recruit Jews and Hindus, or anyone who does not believe or live as they do, overcome their disorders too. So do many other people who also are not normal and have disorders that run the entire gamut.\n\n Trying to influence people to maintain or to accept vertain values is not considered a disorder by any means.

   "If something is a disorder and doesn't help to improve life then it should be overcome.\n\n \n It is not a disorder, because it does not harm. In order for something to be considered a disorder it must be abnormal, maladaptive, and unjustifiable. You may define homosexuality as abnormal, and due to the low population of homosexuals it is abnormal, however it is not maladaptive. It is not adaptive, unless you consider the advantages due to the lowering of the population, but I do not see how it is maladaptive. What harm can come from it?\n \n Also, those who seem to overcome it, whether they really do or not, are often more depressed afterwords. If anything, these people forcing themselves into a heterosexual relationship is a sign of disorder. To sleep with someone you are not attracted to is abnormal, and due to the depression it causes it is maladaptive. It is also unjustifiable to do this, as anyone would notice the inconsistancy of the bible if they believe it says that homosexuality is wrong. God is all loving, but then he damns gays to hell for all time, and they have no choice in the matter. How can someone not see that is unfair, and not very loving. Actually, my heterosexual friends would be more loving than him, as they are able to love homosexuals without even having the slightest desire to make them suffer because of it.\n \n \ne\n It will force the government to be consistent with its ruling and making all behavior that falls into the category that homosexuality does (polygamy, voyeurism, sadist, prostitution, etc) receive recognition.\n\n \n How would this be consistant in its ruling? It would be ruling that any two consenting adults could marry. These behaviors do not fall under that same catagory, and if you think they are in anyway similar you are very wrong. The only similarity is that both are not considered sociably acceptable in this day in age, but many things we do today would once be considered unacceptable. When these things became acceptable, we did not suddenly say everything else, no matter how unrelated, should be considered okay in order to stay consistant, because it would be another issue entirely and consistancy would have nothing to do with it.",

   "You're late. I didn't bring up religon in my argument. Jake did. So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about.\n All laws are based upon morals. So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian.\n\n \n Sorry about that.\n \n \nEngland was one of many countries. There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country.\n\n \n Still, the definition of a family did change at one point.\n \n \nMy definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises.\n \n By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity. Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable. Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views.

It is true that if you change your ideas too often without explaination, you loose respect, but if you refuse too often you become like glass. The reason glass breaks so easily is because it doesn't bend, so if too much force is applied to it, it shatters. If someone refuses to change their views, even when reason tries to force them to, they can't handle it.\n \n Not to mention the fact that the Christian Church has changed it views before, and it's still strong and respected. For example, did you know that the Christian Church once fought against interracial marriages? And that it used to be against women being seen as man's equal? If these views hadn't changed, the growing support of women's rights and interracial marriages would have smashed the church like a mirror.\n \n \nThis argument has a flaw. That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont' have equal rights. Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing. However behavior is regualted by the government. Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society.\n\n \n Yes, but change my example to something that is behavior, like watching Angel, and saying that the rights are the same for those who do and do not like the show, would that be fair to those who like the show?",

   "I can imagine your pain. I'm sorry. I'm going to use this analogy only as a reference. I'm not insinuating that homosexuality is equivalent to anything only on the smae parallel.\n \n You struggle with things like poeple struggle with other disorders. If you read baout pedophiles, voyeurits, sadist, masochists, and many other disorders they struggle to overcome their urges or desires as well. Tehy wnat to change but after a while they give in. Just because people struggle wiht soemthing doesn't mean that it is genetic. \n\n \n Yes, but they have disorders. Being homosexual is not a disorder, because it is not harmful.\n \n \n I've seen people struggle and overcome it. I know you can too. It might be more than you think you can do but you can do it.\n\n \n But why would I want to? So that I can make the overpopulation problem even worse?\n \n \nSo if someone doesn't see me looking into their window while their undressing then their is not harm? Or if i drug a person and have sex wiht them and they dont' knwo it then there is not harm? Or if sell pornography to minors that are already looking at porn and buying it form other vendors then there is no harm.\n\n \n Looking into someone's window without them knowing may not cause them harm, but it is risking the possibility of causing them mental harm, because if they ever find out they will have a hard time getting over the feeling that they are being watched every time they get dressed.\n \n To drug and rape a person does cause harm, even if they don't know it, because there's always physical harm. Not only is there the risk of STDs and pregnancy, both would make the person find out giving them mental harm as well, and if the person is psychologically unable to take care of a kid that would also cause mental harm, the actual act of intercourse leaves behind evidence so that you could figure it out, thus causing mental harm due to the knowledge that you've been raped. I'm pretty sure that there would be some injury around the female genatalia, as the male genetalia is about...well, one time I heard it was an inch and a half in diameter, so I'll go with that, and the female genetalia is one millameter wide. This would have to tear and stretch simply to make room, and I think the female would figure out what happened due to the location of her injuries.\n \n \nSo prostitution isn't harmful to the girls that are pimped by their boyfriends? it sin't harmful to the prostitutes that sleep with other husbands? public nudity isn't harmful to school girls when they're flashed by a big hairy fat guy? Asking a religious question isn't harmful if they don't use it but yet it casts a slight bias already upon the interview? Running a red light isn't harmful when no one else is around but you keep thinking that there isn't and one time you misjudge things.\n \n There is harm and policy reasons in every law. They pass laws to protect and promote a public interest. \n\n \n If there is a girl being forced to be a prostitute by her boyfriend, there is mental harm in being forced to have sex with strangers. \n \n With the husband thing, it is harmful to marriage, but not to the participants of the act. The best thing for that marriage would have been for it to never have existed in the first place, if the husband could not stay within the marriage. However, if he is that kind of man, I doubt he would have chosen to not cheat on his wife.\n \n The girl will be grossed out, but if people were used to the idea of seeing naked people, nudity would not be associated with sex and the girl would not be harmed.\n \n It is almost impossible to keep some form or bias somewhere from forming from some question in the interview. It causes no more harm than anything else off topic in an interview.\n \n The red light thing would cause harm in the case of misjudging, you were right about that one.\n \n \nHeterosexuality is natural and wihtint the norm and therefore everyone's \"inalienable right\".\n\n \n So should engaging in above average intellegence activity also be not permitted? Average intelligence is the norm, and everyone has the \"inalienable right\" to have average intelligence.\n \n \nSo then jake is wrong to say that ex-gays have reoreinted themselves when they say they have.\n\n \n No one reorients themselves, they simply change whether they act on their desires or force themselves to stomach heterosexual sex.\n \n \nAre you saying if gay marriages were permitted then there wouldn't be any lvoeless gay marriages?\n\n \n Not at first, as many gays would have had to wait a long time to get married, and they already know that they could stay together for a long period of time. Eventually, though, they would end up having the same divorce rate as heterosexuals would, in the end. However, heterosexuals would have less loveless marriages, because those homosexuals who wish to marry would be less likely to marry a member of the opposite sex. Not only because they could choose the one they truely wanted but also because gays would be more accepted, and they would have no reason to pretend that they were heterosexual.\n \n \nI don't have that right to marry the one I love. If I was in love with my brother that was 15 and curently married, do I have the right to marry him? No \n Most poeple happen to love the person that is eligible to be married to them.\n\n \n No, but there are reasons for that, where there aren't for not allowing gay marriage. The fifteen year old would not be certain of what he wanted to do with his life, and the marriage would effect that. If he was married, he would also be in love with someone else, and though it may be possible that he loved you both equally, in order for it to work everyone in the marriage would have to love everyone else in the marriage completely. I do not think many people are capable of that, though a few may be.",

They choose to to avoid consequences.\n The fact still remains the government should make laws recognizing that behavior.\n \n \n \n\n So what? If something can appear to be genetic, or it is proven it has a gene for it, that does not make it good or bad in itself. If someone merely naturally reproduces as a heterosexual, does that mean they are capable of providing a good family environment which will help its offspring survive and thrive for example? So what if the heterosexuals are defying the nature of their genetics? You believe gay people are all really straight too, so those gay people are just defying their genetics like the heterosexuals who don't reproduce. \n\n The argument of heterosexuals not necessarily being good parents is not an argument. Being gay doesn't make you a good parent either. However studeis show taht kids grow much more adjusted than those that grow up in gay households overall.\n \n The government doesn't have to recognize couples behavior if they wnat to defy their urges heterosexual or not.\n \n \n \n\n There is nothing genetic to being a Christian, and having a Christian wedding either. One possible theory is the kin selection theory I already outlined. At any rate, I don't think humans are always slaves to what is biological. All our behaviours as humans are so incredibly diverse.\n\n WE agree on something. Humans are not slaves to what is biological or not. So tehy are not slaves to their gay prediposition.\n \n Humans are not genetically Christian. Religion is usually structured. People have biological need for structure.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n No. Do some research on kin selection.\n I did. \n \n Altruism can evolve, therefore, not because it increases the survival and reproduction of the individual who expresses the trait of altruism (since this individual has decreased reproduction) but because it is reproduced by kin of that individual who have, but do not express, the alleles for altruism. Like other traits, altruism will evolve if it is passed from generation to generation more than are alternative alleles for non-altruism. However, we can't describe how altruism will evolve based on the survival and reproduction of the individuals who express altruism, so our usual measure of relative fitness does NOT work to explain the evolution of altruism. Instead, we need to consider something called \"inclusive fitness.\" \n \n Inclusive fitness refers to the degree to which a trait is passed from generation to generation. The trait can be passed from generation to generation directly, by reproduction by individuals who express the trait, and also indirectly, when individuals who express the trait help (are altruistic toward) individuals who carry the alleles for the trait, and who reproduce more because they receive help from the altruistic individuals who express the trait. So both ways in which a trait like altruism can be passed on must be considered to evaluate its inclusive fitness. \n \n http://www.utm.edu/~rirwin/391KinSel.htm\n \n I don't see how this is relevant. It appears altuism promulgates itself through kin selection. The species continues promulgate itself. \n \n \n \n\n You can put yourself into a state of being with your beliefs. One could say being gay is a belief one has that one should have sex with someone of the same sex.\nYou're still making a jump that isn't supported. No one would ever accept that a person can congtrol their mental condition like they can change their thoughts. It is possible to cause a mental condition due to actions based upon your beliefs. That is not the case with religion in general.\n \n \n \n\n As if the right-wing \"ex-gay\" organizations don't have an agenda. Many are affiliated with other political groups that work against equal rights for gays. My anectdotal evidence tells me that many are clearly religiously addicted. I'm talking to one such person online right now who wants to die because he can't be straight as he believes God commands. He believes he will go to hell, but his life is a hell anyway, pressured into a marriage where he feels nothing for his wife. However, he believes God is keeping him in his miserable situation. He has very low self-esteem. Notice that the ex-gay organizations are made up of people who say religion is extremely important to them.\n I don't see how this is relevant. If I believed the government did not care for me and then all of a sudden they helped me overcome a problem and then I became [politically active to help ohters in my situation. How would that make my experience less credible?\n \n Do you ever think that people want to change becasue they are religious as a opposed to poeple who are not religious and complacent with their lifestyle choice?\n \n \n \n\n I'm trying to get this person to see a therapist because of religious addiction before he risks killing himself. I honestly am not making this up. \n\n Religious addiction? What is that? I'm gald you're helping the person.\n \n I see so many people come from affluent backgrounds that are depressed when they don't succeed like other they admire. I also see others that don't care if they suceed like others because they feel that it is not meant for them. I'm really trying to help these affluent people not to be so hard on themselves becasue they are such good people and shouldn't have such high hopes for themselves.",

   "And, btw, how does someone set a gay individual \"free\". Do they put the person in a cage and then unlock it? Or do they set their spirit \"free\" of whatever its being trapped by (stuffy nose maybe)? If you're trying to suggest that someone can be \"taught\" or programmed to stop being a homosexual, then I am sorry for you. Homosexuality isn't a behavioral disorder.\n\n \n Gee I guess its the same kind of setting free that happens when a heterosexual tries and likes homosexuality or when a closeted homosexual comes out of the closet. emoticon_rolleyes Just because you don't believe in the value of reorientation therapy doesn't mean you know all concerning it.\n For instance, not all reorientation therapies involve religion as part of the theraputic process. Some are solely secular psychotherapuetic regimens.\n \n Where is your proof that it isn't a \"behavioral disorder\". All of the studies trying to find genetic causes for homosexuality have come up empty or in some circumstances been found false and debunked. Most research points to enviromental factors and parental nurture as the foundations for how sexuality is formed so basically there is more \"credible\" evidence to show that it is a behavioral. There is even evidence to show that brains of homosexuals undergo a change much like those in pedophiles. So in a sense it could be likened to a disorder. Its the political correctness and pandering of the APA that keeps it from being classified as such. To say all this does not mean that I believe in creating \"deprogramming shops\" but I think we need to examine theraputic regimens more fully. Like it or not there are gays out in the world that are unconsolable with their sexuality. No matter how many times they have had their egos boosted by the gay community and such they may still feel depressed and sometimes suiicidal. Homosexuals have higher rates of depression/mental illness and suicide than heterosexuals and no matter the cause, you cannot just pin the blame on that on the anti-gay crowd possibly bringing them down. Homosexuals do suffer from coping problems within their community. Just a bit of triva. Dr. Spitzer was key in having Homosexuality removed from the APA's list of mental illnesses. Would you believe that he only did this out of sympathy to homosexuals. So even in the psychiatric community, the jury is not out on the causality of homosexuality.\n \n \nIts funny how people in this world talk about equal rights. Then go along and when they hear about gay people they go well they shouldnt get married because its agianst religion or whatever.Now this doesnt count for everyone of course thats obvious. But ive seen that happen way more than once. Its even worse at school. People find out people are gay and they freak and treat the person with rudeness and as if they were an animal.\n If these people would just open thier eyes and see. We all have the same organs, we all have the skin etc etc. Yes i could understand if you disliked them because of thier personality but when you go and judge them and not speak to them or give them an attitude before you got to speak to them. It just shows your a \"wimp\" . People should have the right to do what they want and not have the goverment say no because of thier gender. I say no to banning gay marriage. \n \n If that made no sense what so ever or have stated something incorrectly please correct me\n\n \n This is the thing though. Kids see through all the bull. The saying \"kids are cruel.\" is not true because kids just want to be cruel (although some do) its because kids don't use tactic or guile in debate. They come out and say exactly what they mean usually, the way they and often times others see it. I agree its not cool to be disliked, but this is the backlash of the world. You try to get people comfortable with things they don't like or feel are wrong and they resist. \n \n To you maybe the morality of life that says homosexuality is wrong is trivial. Fine, but how about Murder, theft, adultry. Are you carefree now? Or only when the sexual behaviour of individuals is in question. Its those same morals that say to the common man: murder is wrong, theft is wrong, adultry is wrong that also come into play with concerns to homosexuality. That is why kids freak. There not stupid, their being told right from wrong in the old fashiioned sense most likely. What would be worse, to tell them right from wrong and omit parts out for sake of political correctness or allow them the full knowledge of what is acceptable and what is not? To ask a child to not tease is one thing, to force a child to accept values he is not comfortable with is another. Would you approve of a heterosexual aqaintance cheating on his mate or would you for sake of political correctness ingore it, chalk it up to \"progressive\" society? Does that mean that gays deserve to be teased? No, but it also means that people are realizing values are much more a part of them than popular thought dictates. Kids are more sophisticated now, most know the \"birds and bees\" before their parents can tell them. They know gay sex while human and quite possibly done for ages is not a \"viable\" method of reproduction, which what I think kids associate sex with more in their early understanding of it. I think the real issue is not \"should gays be allowed to marry.\" I think the issue should be \"should we redefine society based on homosexual behavior(s)\" This is what they are essentially asking us to do. They'll deny it but change has ripple effects. Just look at Sweden, now that gays can marry there the divorce rates have skyrocketed amongst these gay couples. In Denmark heterosexual marriages are so far down, they're almost mythological. These societies have commitied to allowing gays to be seen as equals so its too late to reverse. Its already happening that way in some of the countries that have just started allowing gay marriage and It could happen this way here. So should we be accepting \"behaviour\" that some see as immoral, others see as harmful to society? Personally I say no. \n \n Though I believe the religious moral arguements have merit and deserve to be a part of debate concerning this topic my views are not religion based. Persoanally I believe homosexual relationships to be biologically inferrior and unsound in relation to heterosexual ones. While nature may afford our bodies both hetero and homo sexual proclivities, it is only the heterosexual that continues survival of the species, I have yet to see a homosexual be born through homosexual means. Heterosexual sex in its purest mechanical form is also the most healthiest with male and female sexual organs obviously designed to accomodate each other with minimal or negligible physical damage during normal activity and normal health. Homosexuality while also seen in nature is abberant. Though animials of many species exhibit this it is not regarded as productive. Not only that but atempting to base human mores on animal ones is a bad idea. Animals regularly abandon or eat their offspring, which of course wouldn't rational behavior for humans, especially considering humans were gifted with higher reasoning skills and not just base instincts. Homosexual anal sex is almost always damaging physically to the individuals involved. Male sex organs coupled anally are not totally complementary with damage occuring at not only visible levels but more frequently at a cellular level. Male homosexuals have higher incidents of anal prolapse, tearing, rectal cancers, infections, fistulas, fissures, urethritis and other non-HIV/venereal infections than their heterosexual couterparts. Does this mean that I hate gays. No, homosexuals are people too, but I don't believe in promoting homosexual agendas,goals or behaviors any more than I would promote divorce, rape, incest or infideltiy. As such I also don't believe that desire not to promote those values is hatefull or bigoted, unlike the great outcries of \"homophobe\" we always hear when heteros don't agree or support homosexuals. I do believe the right to marriage as being between a unaltered man and woman. Same sex couples wanting to be married to me is a perversion of the institution, in looks as a petty attempt to damage the institution. The arguement that its unfair that gay couples don't get the same recognition as married couples, to me is ludicrous. Married couples have a higher chance of creating a family, of course the deserve governmental tax brakes. Homosexual couples while desiring to be \"families\" are not guaranteed this ability because it was not forseen long ago that they would be put in postions of creating families. If gays deserve special treatment then I think single people should be given special priveleges to, to encourage them to create families and so they won't feel left out. I think before any change is made to our way of life we should have a nice long study of same-sex marriage in European society before we just institute it here. That way we can see and perhaps guage the outcome, before it turns us into another Denmark or Sweden.\n \n Weekly Standard article of gay marriage causing decline \n \n National Review Kurtz rebuttal\n \n http://www.marriagedebate.com/pdf/SSdivorcerisk.pdf",

I do not see why this ties into adultry. Murder and theft directly harm someone, so that is why it is immoral. Adultry spreads disease, so that is harmful too. Also, even though you may know marriage to be a thing between a man and a woman who get to share tax returns, once upon a time it was an emotional bond and well, one that stated that the two were truely in love and couldn't love anyone else or be broken apart by anything but death. Adultry means that for all that time, their marriage was not truely a marriage, or anything at all.\n \n \nThat is why kids freak. There not stupid, their being told right from wrong in the old fashiioned sense most likely. What would be worse, to tell them right from wrong and omit parts out for sake of political correctness or allow them the full knowledge of what is acceptable and what is not?\n\n \n But how is homosexuality wrong?\n \n \nTo ask a child to not tease is one thing, to force a child to accept values he is not comfortable with is another. Would you approve of a heterosexual aqaintance cheating on his mate or would you for sake of political correctness ingore it, chalk it up to \"progressive\" society?

This would be more likely to happen if gay marriage was legal.\n \n \nNo, but it also means that people are realizing values are much more a part of them than popular thought dictates.

These societies have commitied to allowing gays to be seen as equals so its too late to reverse.\n\n \n Is that really such a bad thing? After all, we now have medical ways to reproduce without heterosexual sex. That would decrease the world's population, as not everyone would do that, as well as the number of accidental births. Parents and children would be closer, as the children would know that the parents wanted them, and there would be no hate crimes against gays. A decreased population would mean enough food in the whole world for everybody, as well as a decrease in war. It is much easier to keep the peace in a small group than a large one.\n \n \nIts already happening that way in some of the countries that have just started allowing gay marriage and It could happen this way here. So should we be accepting \"behaviour\" that some see as immoral, others see as harmful to society?

While nature may afford our bodies both hetero and homo sexual proclivities, it is only the heterosexual that continues survival of the species, I have yet to see a homosexual be born through homosexual means.\n \n \n Yes, but now you can artificially inject semen without any sex at all. Also, with our overpopulation problem, heterosexuality could be the death of the species as well. There is only so much food and space in the world, and at this reproduction rate we are going to run out.\n \n \nHeterosexual sex in its purest mechanical form is also the most healthiest with male and female sexual organs obviously designed to accomodate each other with minimal or negligible physical damage during normal activity and normal health.\n\n \n Are you sure about that? Heterosexual sex goes as follows: The female's one millimeter hole gets a one inch hidious peg rammed into it, tearing the hole until it is big enough for the peg. Wow, how...not physical damaging. I think lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.\n \n \nHomosexuality while also seen in nature is abberant. Though animials of many species exhibit this it is not regarded as productive.

   " There is almost no consensus among any group of professionals. We look at the majority.\n\n \n I don't believe the majority use the term \"disorder\" when referring to homosexuality in nature.\n \n \nIt's true as much as you don't want to accept it.\n\n \n I didn't say it wasn't true that heterosexuality is natural. Homosexuality is natural too. If homosexuality went against the law of nature, humans would not be able to violate that law.\n \n \n \nIt would unusual and highly unlikely.\n\n \n Maybe you need to get out more. Does something being unusual make it good or bad?\n \n \nEven men that use condoms still would rather not use a condom. They choose to to avoid consequences.\n\n \n There are many reasons why people use condoms. It avoids disease(natural) and pregnancy. It also reduces sensation slightly which can delay climax. This makes the sexual act more pleasurable, but doesn't help reproduction.\n \n \nThe fact still remains the government should make laws recognizing that behavior.\n\n \n Even if the majority are not like that for perhaps all their lives? Even if it does not lead to reproduction?\n \n \nThe argument of heterosexuals not necessarily being good parents is not an argument. Being gay doesn't make you a good parent either. However studeis show taht kids grow much more adjusted than those that grow up in gay households overall.\n\n \n Children deserve to know that their relationships with both of their parents are stable and legally recognized. This applies to all children, whether their parents are of the same or opposite sex. The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes that a considerable body of professional literature provides evidence that children with parents who are homosexual can have the same advantages and the same expectations for health, adjustment, and development as can children whose parents are heterosexual.1-9 When 2 adults participate in parenting a child, they and the child deserve the serenity that comes with legal recognition. \n http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3b109/2/339\n \n \nWE agree on something. Humans are not slaves to what is biological or not. So tehy are not slaves to their gay prediposition.\n\n \n No, not slaves to anything. But this doesn't make something right or wrong, including with being gay. \n \n \nHumans are not genetically Christian. Religion is usually structured. People have biological need for structure.\n\n \n If that is true, it doesn't mean humans necessarily have a need for the particular structure of Christianity.\n \n \n \nI don't see how this is relevant. It appears altuism promulgates itself through kin selection. The species continues promulgate itself.\n\n \n But not necessarily through reproduction. How they've tied it into with Darwin's, is to say that those who engage in kin selection help others to reproduce by acting as helpers, without reproducing themselves.\n \n \nYou're still making a jump that isn't supported. No one would ever accept that a person can congtrol their mental condition like they can change their thoughts. It is possible to cause a mental condition due to actions based upon your beliefs. That is not the case with religion in general.\n\n \n Your thoughts can create your mental condtion.\n \n \nI don't see how this is relevant. If I believed the government did not care for me and then all of a sudden they helped me overcome a problem and then I became [politically active to help ohters in my situation. How would that make my experience less credible?\n\n \n I'm glad most others today encourage people to accept themselves.\n \n \nDo you ever think that people want to change becasue they are religious as a opposed to poeple who are not religious and complacent with their lifestyle choice?\n\n \n Who is being complacent?\n \n \nReligious addiction? What is that? I'm gald you're helping the person.\n\n \n He's obsessed with the idea he is going to hell, because of what he has been taught. Apparently God put him into this marriage of his where he doesn't care for his wife, but God isn't responsible for him being gay. I'll come back with a link for religious addiction. It concerns an obsession with rules, and not thinking for one's self, with being perfect. Everything is black and white, heaven or hell. I just basically advised him to get therapy for that, and other issues. Then he attacked me, and won't speak to me or anyone else who was trying to give him advice(Christians), because he can't handle criticism of anything that challenges his particular viewpoint. After all, it's God's plan for him that he should be miserable denying who he is. He even said dying may be the only cure for being gay. He's tried and tried not to be gay. I don't know how God would expect to be served if God puts the person in an inescpable situation where the person is so depressed that the person wants to die. I really did not try to push my lack of religion onto him. I told him he was just using his own religion in a destructive way, and the problem was not with religion itself. \n \n \nI see so many people come from affluent backgrounds that are depressed when they don't succeed like other they admire. I also see others that don't care if they suceed like others because they feel that it is not meant for them.\n\n \n I really don't think his problems are because he is not as successful as the heterosexual.

   "That was because they were trying to find a single gay gene, but it may not be just one gene, but a combination of many. Also, they have not found proof of handedness or many other characteristics that are generally accepted as genetic. Besides, they have found the gay gene in fruit flies, just not humans, but our genetic code is so much more complex that we don't have just one gene for all our sexual activity.\n\n \n No they were trying to not just find a singel gene but overall genetic causality in general. That is why there were so many studies. They have failed to find conclusive proof that sexuality of either type is geneticly derived. This in light of other behaviors is irrelevant. Handedness can also be learned, there is no proof it is geneticly derived or that it isn't but just because it is accepted as genetic doesn't validate that assumption or assumptions for any other behaviors. The tendancy to be nervous or rape or commit other crimes may or may not be genetically related. So far they have no proof but would you say that a person genetically predisposed to anxiety is a positive benefit. The justification that something may be genetic makes it some how \"acceptable\" is invalid. It may alleviate the feelings that individuals have no responsiblity for control of certain behaviors but that doesn't automatically mean those behaviors is a good or desireable thing. Let me ask you this... If it were found out tomorrow that we isolated a cluster of genes that are responsible for homosexuality AND had the ability to remove said genes out of individuals, would you strive to ensure that homosexuality is genetically protected or would you support individuals re-engiineering their children to weed out such trait, which by wrote could render homosexuality extinct eventually? Big question but an important one, because this is where I think alot of people are kidding themselves in this whole \"gene vs. enviroment\" debate. Were moving toward an era where we will be able to alter our own bodies on a genetic level, if there is the slightest iota of genetic homosexuality do you really think it will last through the \"splicer\" years. Cmon, you know it wouldn't and then gays would be fighting for legislation to make it illegal to genetically elimiate homosexuality and then where will we be. \n \n \nEinstein's brain had unusual structures in it, could he have had some kind of disorder as well? One that made him smarter than everyone else?\n\n \n I dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too. Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain. The jury is not out yet\n \n \nIt was the fact that there was such controversy surrounding it that it was looked into in the first place.\n\n \n Yes it is true that homosexuality was controversial, however it was not the controversy that lead to the decision being made to remove it. It was the act of one doctor who was sympathetic to homosexuals. It was the choice of one individual, based on compassion, not factual data. Patently dangerous and wrong in my opinion. \n \n \n \"Japanese also have high suicide rates, does that mean being Japanese is a disorder? Plus, even though within the homosexual community, if a given homosexual is Christian, it is their own bible telling them they are doing something wrong. I don't think a little support from friends is going to make someone feel better if they think they are going to hell.\"\n\n \n No being Japanese is not a disorder. What you are neglecting is causality of depression and suicide. That is why I mentioned that the high rates cannot possibly be attributed to just homosexuals that are ostracized by the religious or openly hostile anti-gay individuals. There must be associative behavior and cause within the community, within these homosexual relationships themselves. Is that caused by homosexual brains? Unsure. Is it the indivduals themselves and the assosiative issues within the homosexual relationship. Quite likely, but still causality is not 100% clear. I'm sure if you delved deeper into the causes of Japanese suicides you would find a myriad of reasons much like any colletive with high suicide rates. On the issue of homosexuality and the bible, that is indeed unfortunate. Does that mean the bible should change to be more amenable to those commiting what was deemed sinful by it long ago. I don't think so. Granted I am not basing my arguements against homosexuality on biblical or other religious text but I think to \"change\" religion to suit society is dangerous. Even if you don't believe in a particular religion I don't think its wise to alter its credo to conform to society any more than it would be correct to force a religion on an individual. You run the risk of invalidating the true message of the religion. Its kinda like the debate about censoring literature with curse words or racial epithets in them. Many may feel offended that Twain used the \"N\" word but to alter what is an important work of art and not just literature for sake of political correctness damages the social fabric of how society has evolved and changed through the generations. I cannot offer an easy method for Homosexual Christians to feel better about themselves, but the fact that the conflict exists means that a certain individual feels a loyalty to more than just his personal desires. That is a struggle they weigh individually. What is more important, their sexuality or being moral within the framework of Chrisitanity, or Judiaism, or Islam for that matter. Just because the Christians are more vocal doesn't mean they are the only ones that religiously object to homosexuality either, how about smacking up some of the other religions?\n \n \n\"That may be true, but it isn't harmful so I doubt it really should be on the list.\"\n\n \n Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating \"reorientation therapies\" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.\n \n \n \n\"A homosexual is no more likely to cheat on their mate than a hetersexual. I do not see why this ties into adultry. Murder and theft directly harm someone, so that is why it is immoral. Adultry spreads disease, so that is harmful too. Also, even though you may know marriage to be a thing between a man and a woman who get to share tax returns, once upon a time it was an emotional bond and well, one that stated that the two were truely in love and couldn't love anyone else or be broken apart by anything but death. Adultry means that for all that time, their marriage was not truely a marriage, or anything at all.\"\n\n \n I didn't say that a homosexual was more likely to cheat than a heterosexual. What I alluded to was the fact that one indivdual was making a statement against moral values, when he neglects to recognize the root of said morals. The same values that say murder, adultry and theft are wrong are the same values that say homosexuality is wrong. Just because its between two individuals doesn't mean no one else can be affected. You brought up how adultry is bad becaue it spreads disease. Hello, take a look at how many men have given their women AIDS from being on the \"DL\" and having gay sex. Homosexuality is capable of spreading and creating disease just like heterosexual sex, the difference is most heterosexuals that have sex with only their partner and are \"healthy\" are not at risk for an infection or condition that could be harmful to them by having sex. You cannot necessarily say that with homosexuals engaging in anal sex. Talk to a doctor about how damaging anal sex is and the different problems associated with anal penetration if you think I am joking. You don't see many cases of prolapsed rectums, and increases in rectal cancer due to vaginal sex. THe causality of those reactions to anal sex (within the male homosexual community) has been shown. Political correctness keeps most doctors hush hush about it though. Oh and BTW I do believe marriage is not just between two people who want to consolidate their finances. If adultry means what you said, then how come a marriage is not diissolved officially until a judge declares divorce? What about if the couple reconciles the adultry incident and continues on with their marriage? I think the nuances of adultry are more complicated then your simplistic understanding.\n \n \nBut how is homosexuality wrong?\n\n \n I'm not going to get into a religious debate, but I can appreciate someone taking a religious stance against it. Why do I think it is wrong? I think its wrong in the sense that it is treated as equal to heterosexualty. Its not, it cannot be, and that is no ones fault but natures. Nature doesn't allow homosexual sex to create life, to reproduce, and though humans use sex as entertainment, it obviously was meant for a greater purpose. Biology shows us we need both male and female to create life, that male and male doesn't create life, that indivdual gratification doesn't create life. If you want to attach relgious or philosophical significance to sex you may at this juncture. That is why I think it is wrong. Humanity wouldn't be around if homosexuality were the standard, homosexuals wouldn't exist without heterosexuals. You may be looking for a more fundamental \"morality\" to my basis. I choose to validate my beliefs on science and years of living proof of heterosexualitie's superiority, and when I mean hetero superiority I mean strict hetero adhearance, no socially unacceptable behavior being thrown in like \"cheating\" or \"rape\". \n \n \n\"No, but you can have a homosexual aquaintance as the only aquaintance, and thus it wouldn't be adultry. This would be more likely to happen if gay marriage was legal.\"\n\n \n Ah but that is conjecture. At least in this country you cannot fully guage this becaue we have not had years of same sex marriage. Basically you are saying that homosexuals would be less likey to cheat on each other if same sex marriage were instituted. I'd like to see your supporting data on this. Take a look at some societies that have had same sex marriages for a while now and you might be surprised. In Sweden the rate of divorce amongst same sex couples surpasses heterosexual divorce. So sexual preference is no measure of security against adultry or cheating.\n \n \n \nYes, but that didn't happen in Demark.\n\n \n No, in Denmark, the rates of cohabilitation and out of wedlock births went up and heterosexual marriage is declining because the population sees the same sex marriage as an excuese to live lifestyles where traditional family is outdated. This is also happening in Sweden and Norway. Basically heteros see the society as so open that there is no longer any need for traditional family, that cohabilitation and single parent homes are just as acceptable as traditional marriage. If these countries are good indicators like they seem to be then other nations will follow the same route. I don't think that would be a positive thing for the U.S. or any nation for that matter. Right now what is known as the Norweigian Cohabilitation Syndrome is got its claws into Britian, where more individuals are having children with partners and living with them instead of marrying them. This syndrome is having a slow creep into the U.S. as well. Though there is not guarantee same sex marriage will not hasten this and other deteriorating family values, the trend is looking pretty bleak and hastening not slowing family disolution.\n \n \n \n \nIs that really such a bad thing? After all, we now have medical ways to reproduce without heterosexual sex. That would decrease the world's population, as not everyone would do that, as well as the number of accidental births. Parents and children would be closer, as the children would know that the parents wanted them, and there would be no hate crimes against gays. A decreased population would mean enough food in the whole world for everybody, as well as a decrease in war. It is much easier to keep the peace in a small group than a large one.\n\n \n Hey if Denmark wants to limit their populations with these measures that is their business but where is the voice of those in Denmark that want better? Its been forced out by the homosexual agenda.This sounds Socio-fascist to me. Reproduction via artificial means is NEVER a first resort. It is a last resort for those that are having difficulty having children or unable to produce children through natural means. Its not a panacea and should never be treated as such. Ever read Brave New World? THe desire to curb accidental births is admirable but, who gets the responsibility. Some big brother government like in China where state sanctioned abortions is the way or do people get to have freewill over their reproductive rights. All you are suggesting is just another means of limiting choice in a world of shrinking choices. Its altruistic that you want everyone in the world to be fed but how about getting countries with crappy governments to take care of their populations first before you force other nations into a communist wealth sharing scheme. I'd love to see Castro stripped to the bone, if it meant the people of Cuba could live normal lives. Just throwing wealth at poverty is unwise, especially when the majority of these poor countries are run by \"fat cat\" potentates that rob their citizens of luxury and basic necessity. I also think your statement about children and parents is \"polyanna\" reasoning. There is no evidence to say that parents and children would somehow become closer through enforced or regulated reproduction. I'd like to see some data on that one. As for limiting hate crimes against gays, I would rather see hate crimes against gays be punished like any other \"hate crime\" and stop priveledging gays because someone commits an offense against them. An offense is an offense, sexuality may be the root cause but I don't think gays deserve a special preference over any other individual subjected to prejudical hate. All that does is send a message that one group of individuals deserves a special beneficance over another. And I would like to see corrolary data from you supporting your arguement that a smaller more controlled population would bring these issues under control. You may be right but I don't think your small collective would have much freewill in their society and I am definately no supporter of socialist societies. \n \n \n \nPeople once thought of interracial marriages this way.\n\n \n Ah but interracial marriages were only socially prejudiced. There was no real biological basis for the prejudice. We know that interracial diversity is biologically sound. Sometimes there are genetic or congenital anomollies that can be detrimental to the offspring of interracial couples, but these conditions do not preclude the validity of said relationships. You are trying to equate sexuality with racial diversity. This is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce. This trumps homosexuality's abilities two fold. \n \n \nYes, but now you can artificially inject semen without any sex at all. Also, with our overpopulation problem, heterosexuality could be the death of the species as well. There is only so much food and space in the world, and at this reproduction rate we are going to run out.\n\n \n This is a poor arguement for eugenics, population control and support of gay marriage. You could also replace an entire countries clothing with uniforms, that way everyone will dress alike and thus the risk of some poor soul being teased for looking \"different\" will be diminished. Don't see alot of demand for that. The idea that technology is going to save us by keeping our population in check is Orwellian if not Huxleyian and totally abhorent to most. Maybe you would gladly give up your right to reproduce for sake of a that has for the past 100 years never reached fruition. I don't see many people supporting your cause if it means destroying individual freedoms for the sake of a \"statist\" ideal. All this is Malthusian socialism. We eliminated that idea once we reached the industrial revolution. If we are so great with technology to use it so drastically like you claim, why not attempt to colonize another planet within our system or build underwater colonies. At least you are broadening horizions for future growth and not rigidly and fascistly usurping the future. \n \n \n \nAre you sure about that? Heterosexual sex goes as follows: The female's one millimeter hole gets a one inch hidious peg rammed into it, tearing the hole until it is big enough for the peg. Wow, how...not physical damaging. I think lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.\n\n \n Well be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place. I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said \"minimal or negligable physical damage\".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is \n the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the \"peg\" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.\n \n \nI'm sure ramming the peg in the vagina, which is smaller than the anus, is harmful as well\n. \n \n Ahem, maybe you better talk to a doctor about the differences in sexual trauma between vaginal sex and anal sex. Its alot more than \"ramming the peg in the vagina.\" as you so eloquently put it. In fact is not mainly an issue of penile force as much as it is the structures and purposes of say a vagina versus an anus. \n \n \n Reproduction is a bad thing, why would it make the family superior? And how is what happened in Denmark a bad thing?\n\n \n I didn't say reproduction was a bad thing. I think its a good thing and it does make the family superior and makes heterosexual behavior superior and right in my eyes. I think \"reinventing\" the family to support cohabilitaing adults and homosexuals wishing to adopt and raise children is a bad thing. I don't like divorce or out of wedlock parenting, I consider them bad for marriage as much as I consider gay marriage to be. The fact ot the matter is were discussing bans on gay marriage. Well, to be banned it would have to have been legal in the first place. Here in the states it never was so technically it cannot be banned yet. However I am not for legalizing gay marriage as I see it as an affront to heterosexual marriage and family and supporting ideals that to me are not productive to society. Nature may afford homosexual behavior, it is not that behavior that creates societey and life so therefore I don't recognize the claims of equality. Denmark serves as a great example becasue in their full acceptance of gay marriage they have sent a message that the traditional family is a negative thing, its passe and the incomplete family that so many were against for quite some time is now chique and acceptable. They tried to say in all the instances where gay marriage was accepted in society that heterosexual marriage was strengthed, but they failed seeing how low heterosexual marriage has fallen and the rate of single parent \"families\" and cohabilitations have risen along gay marriage. Maybe in Denmark the population will drop off in another decade or so, as less get married, maybe most will not have children. Then what of the future of Denmark? Maybe the government will get concerned and promote traditional marriage? Maybe they will abolsh gay marriage and things will repair themselves over time? Who knows, but its looking real bleak for Scandanavian states these days. Who knows how this will affect their cultural identity in the next generation.",

   "No they were trying to not just find a singel gene but overall genetic causality in general. That is why there were so many studies. They have failed to find conclusive proof that sexuality of either type is geneticly derived. This in light of other behaviors is irrelevant. Handedness can also be learned, there is no proof it is geneticly derived or that it isn't but just because it is accepted as genetic doesn't validate that assumption or assumptions for any other behaviors. The tendancy to be nervous or rape or commit other crimes may or may not be genetically related. So far they have no proof but would you say that a person genetically predisposed to anxiety is a positive benefit. The justification that something may be genetic makes it some how \"acceptable\" is invalid. It may alleviate the feelings that individuals have no responsiblity for control of certain behaviors but that doesn't automatically mean those behaviors is a good or desireable thing. Let me ask you this... If it were found out tomorrow that we isolated a cluster of genes that are responsible for homosexuality AND had the ability to remove said genes out of individuals, would you strive to ensure that homosexuality is genetically protected or would you support individuals re-engiineering their children to weed out such trait, which by wrote could render homosexuality extinct eventually? Big question but an important one, because this is where I think alot of people are kidding themselves in this whole \"gene vs. enviroment\" debate.

Cmon, you know it wouldn't and then gays would be fighting for legislation to make it illegal to genetically elimiate homosexuality and then where will we be.\n\n \n Well, who knows? I hope at that point our society will be more accepting of diversity. Women are certainly more accepting of homosexuality. I think women would not want their uterus and fetus tampered with, to be made straight, just because it would be shown to have a gene which could make it gay. There are many deaf people who would not become hearing if that could be cured, and who do not even learn to speak, because they see themselves as \"differently abled\". It is who they are, and they appreciate their culture.\n \n \nI dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too.\n\n \n The study you were originally referring to, I believe, looked at rats put into two different groups. One group was 100% celibate, the other group were extremely sexual. Changes in the brains were observed. However, the differences in behaviour between the two groups were very extreme. \n \n \nYes it is true that homosexuality was controversial, however it was not the controversy that lead to the decision being made to remove it. It was the act of one doctor who was sympathetic to homosexuals. It was the choice of one individual, based on compassion, not factual data. Patently dangerous and wrong in my opinion.\n\n \n It was also the result of studies done on gays outside of the institutional setting, such as that done by people like Dr. Evelyn Hooker. \n \n \nNo being Japanese is not a disorder.\n\n \n Nor is homosexuality.\n \n \nWhat you are neglecting is causality of depression and suicide. That is why I mentioned that the high rates cannot possibly be attributed to just homosexuals that are ostracized by the religious or openly hostile anti-gay individuals. There must be associative behavior and cause within the community, within these homosexual relationships themselves. Is that caused by homosexual brains? Unsure. Is it the indivduals themselves and the assosiative issues within the homosexual relationship. Quite likely, but still causality is not 100% clear.\n\n \n There are many possible causes. Nothing to idicate homosexuality itself is the cause. However, the following studies shown do show rejection and fear of rejection by family and friends and closetedness play a role(you can click on the abstracts available in the references in the following link)....\n \n Of the 10 studies, 6 explored risks for suicide by comparing attemptors and nonattemptors. They found that suicide attempts were neither universal nor attributable to homosexuality per se, but they were significantly associated with gender nonconformity,3 early awareness of homosexuality,3, 8, 11, 14 stress,12 violence,14 lack of support,8, 11, 14 school drop-out,12 family problems,8 acquaintances' suicide attempts,12 homelessness,12 and substance abuse3 or other psychiatric symptoms.6, 11, 14 \n \n http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/282/13/1291?ijkey=5d755bc389652d8cc9c1f645e8e8ecd225f53f92&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha#REF-JMS1006-6-1-3\n \n It appears many differences in suicide rates and depression, life expectancy, etc., among many different groups....\n \n Differences in the health of blacks and whites are many and varied. Blacks have more undetected diseases, higher disease and illness rates (from infectious conditions such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases), more chronic conditions (such as hypertension and diabetes), and shorter life expectancies than whites (78,79,80,81). Morbidity and mortality rates for blacks from many conditions (cancer, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and homicide) exceed those for whites (80,82). These findings exist even though black females are generally less likely than white females to report risk behaviors such as smoking cigarettes, consuming alcohol, or using other substances (79,83,84,85). \n \n Hispanic and white women have a higher lifetime prevalence of depression (24 percent and 22 percent, respectively) than black women (16 percent). Furthermore, when surveyed in 1991, nearly twice as large a share of Hispanic women (11 percent) reported being depressed as did black and white women (nearly 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively) (80). \n http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/toc.htm\n \n Suicide rates among black youth increase dramatically, different ideas as to the causes...\n http://members.aol.com/digasa/stats21.htm\n \n Blacks have shorter life expectancy compared to whites...\n http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/figure1.htm\n \n \nOn the issue of homosexuality and the bible, that is indeed unfortunate.

It messes with their ideas of gender roles. There may be room for interpretation in text, and perhaps some slight changing of custom, which may not bring the whole thing down. Religion has to change with society to survive in that society, as religion is a social human construct.\n \n \nWell that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally.

They would have been \"eliminated\" because heterosexuality is far superior. Think again. The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission (bacteria dividing), asexual reproduction (there goes your \"individual gratification argument), and zygotic reproduction. None of these things require sexes of any type. \n \n Even animals that have \"normal\" sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis, in which only a female is required to produce offspring (turkeys and lizards do this). If homosexuality isn't natural or is inferior, then why do we see examples of it in nature. The bonobo (closely related to the chimpanzee) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild, and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor. \n \n Look, you can't say that one way of reproduction is \"the standard\" since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways. You also can't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is \"natural\" is valid. Also, you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a \"greater purpose\". By implying that something has a purpose, you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology. If you want to assume that things were given \"purpose\" by some higher being, that's fine, but you'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument. In science, it is impossible to assume a purpose. For example, what is the purpose of a river? To flow to the ocean? To carve a canyon? To carry sediment? You can say what something is good at doing, or what it does, but you cannot say what it was \"made\" for (purpose) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion. As for hetero and homosexuality, it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals. Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or \"life\", heterosexuality would be superior. But in the eyes of science and reason, your argument doesn't hold water.",

   " I have read your posts, all of them, at not one point have you proved anything like this, all you have done is spout doctrine of what you have been told to beleive by homophobes, even if you yourself do not hold the same gay hating views, you are still perpetuating them. Quote me an example of you 'proving' you relgious people arn't weak minded and I will apologise.\n\n First off I'm not a homophobic. Is everyone that disagrees wiht Judaism antisemtic? What is your definiton of homophobic?\n I do not spout doctrine. I share my views that I have logically proven. So if you condier it all doctrine and dismiss it all then of course it is not evident. I did the same to you there would be no debate because we'd jsut be dismissing each other's arguments.\n \n The fact that I showed-\n Homosexuality is not genetic\n Gay marriages degrade the institution\n Homosexuality is a disorder \n Recognizing disoprders such as homosexuality will lead to other disorders needing equality of recognition\n There is a public interest in not allowing gay marriage.\n They have equality because they have all rights afforded to anyone else.\n It isn't discrimination and if it is then the whole constitution is discriminatory.\n All laws are morally based and we as a society decide what is morally acceptable.\n Homosexuality is behavior and laws govern behavior not race, gender, abilities, etc.\n \n \n \n \n There is quite a difference between being able to marry someone you love and enjoying a particular job, the nymphomania bit is still irrelevant as anyone could enjoy their job and there is massive negative effects with prostitution whcih their isn't for gay marriage. \n\n The argument is that gays desires deserves recognition in marriage. Why can't nymphomaniacs claim their desires deserves recognition in profession? YOu can't discriminate gays at work?\n There are negaitve effects of homosexuality, probably more so than prostitution. Just as colon and Gastronal Intestine specialists.\n \n \n \n Hardly the best, but best isn't really needed, however you are homophobic even if you don't like to call yourself it. So you beleive in changing nothing, well monarchy worked really well for a bit, as did tribal societies. Guess it would be really bad to change stuff like that otherwise government and leadership would lose all integrity (um..bad example really ;) ) same with medicines, far better to just pray to god for a cure rather than use drugs, at least the principle of healing people will still have integrity. Do you honestly beleive that more heterosexuals will get divorced if homosexual marriage is allowed, or people will stop caring for children?\n\n Monarchy and tribal governments were changed to democracy a proven instituion. monarchy and tribal government don't exist if they' been replaced.\n \n So your analogy is flawed. You say keep the same instituion and change the standard. TAht is different than saying keep change the insitution for another institution.\n \n Also your medical analogy is also not relevant. It's frustrating pointing it out. Changing methods and changing standards are nto the same. I''ll let you figure out how that isn't relevant.\n \n SAy what you want. I'm not afraid of gays or have a bias agianst them. I simply disagree with their lifestyle and mentality. Using the term homophobic has been your best argument so far. \n \n \n \n It is in the publics interest, gays are part of the public and pretty much half the population are in favour of it (the flip side to your 50 or so percent saying gay marriage is wrong), and the other half is giving the same reasons as you...'I don't like it'. Where is the harm other than people refusing to accpet them (you don't support it because it can cause emotional problems because you won't accept them, because of the harm their beliefs cause from the emotional harm caused by...). It is not a mental disorder, and only things that have a definite negative effect actaully need to be overcome, things that are neutral do not need to be.\n \n Actually give some reasoning for your veiws rather than endless circular arguments- what negative effect will actually occur to people who don't participate in gay marriage, if gay marriage is official recognised?\n\n \n More than 60% oppose gay marriage according to the latest polls.\n http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm\n \n Also I gave you many arguments above and you simply dismiss them. So that's why their circular you haven't proven them not credible DEFINITVELY. I may not aas well but I proved there is a basis and it's debateable. Until it's proven definitvely then you can't say it's not relevant.",

   "No they were trying to not just find a singel gene but overall genetic causality in general. That is why there were so many studies. They have failed to find conclusive proof that sexuality of either type is geneticly derived. This in light of other behaviors is irrelevant. Handedness can also be learned, there is no proof it is geneticly derived or that it isn't but just because it is accepted as genetic doesn't validate that assumption or assumptions for any other behaviors. The tendancy to be nervous or rape or commit other crimes may or may not be genetically related. So far they have no proof but would you say that a person genetically predisposed to anxiety is a positive benefit. \n\n \n Just because something is genetically predisposed does not mean it has a positive benefit, but I never said that it did. Homosexuality is different, because it has no negative reprocussions that are not caused by something social or religious.\n \n \nThe justification that something may be genetic makes it some how \"acceptable\" is invalid. It may alleviate the feelings that individuals have no responsiblity for control of certain behaviors but that doesn't automatically mean those behaviors is a good or desireable thing. Let me ask you this... If it were found out tomorrow that we isolated a cluster of genes that are responsible for homosexuality AND had the ability to remove said genes out of individuals, would you strive to ensure that homosexuality is genetically protected or would you support individuals re-engiineering their children to weed out such trait, which by wrote could render homosexuality extinct eventually? Big question but an important one, because this is where I think alot of people are kidding themselves in this whole \"gene vs. enviroment\" debate. Were moving toward an era where we will be able to alter our own bodies on a genetic level, if there is the slightest iota of genetic homosexuality do you really think it will last through the \"splicer\" years. Cmon, you know it wouldn't and then gays would be fighting for legislation to make it illegal to genetically elimiate homosexuality and then where will we be. \n\n \n I would fight to protect homosexuality, because it is a good thing. If there were no homosexuals, the human population would rise, and I see no point in having more people in this world. We have enough, too many in fact. I would like it if there weren't so many people in the world that millions of acres of trees had to be cut down every day in order to make room and supplies for all the people.\n \n \nI dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too. Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain. The jury is not out yet\n\n \n Then you also have to consider the definition of disorder. A disorder is not just something that is different, but something different and negative. Intelligence is not a negative.\n \n \nYes it is true that homosexuality was controversial, however it was not the controversy that lead to the decision being made to remove it. It was the act of one doctor who was sympathetic to homosexuals. It was the choice of one individual, based on compassion, not factual data. Patently dangerous and wrong in my opinion. \n\n \n It may have been taken off for the wrong reasons, but there was really no reason for it to be on there in the first place.\n \n \nNo being Japanese is not a disorder. What you are neglecting is causality of depression and suicide. That is why I mentioned that the high rates cannot possibly be attributed to just homosexuals that are ostracized by the religious or openly hostile anti-gay individuals. There must be associative behavior and cause within the community, within these homosexual relationships themselves. Is that caused by homosexual brains? Unsure. Is it the indivduals themselves and the assosiative issues within the homosexual relationship. Quite likely, but still causality is not 100% clear. I'm sure if you delved deeper into the causes of Japanese suicides you would find a myriad of reasons much like any colletive with high suicide rates.\n\n \n Yes, but this is why I brought up the bible, because that would be an alternate reason that would not be caused by homosexual brains that could occur in cultures supportive of homosexuality. I believe that you are right about Japanese culture, if you delved into it you would find there is not a genetic but cultural cause for their high suicide rates, but I believe that you would find the same thing with homosexuality.\n \n \nOn the issue of homosexuality and the bible, that is indeed unfortunate. Does that mean the bible should change to be more amenable to those commiting what was deemed sinful by it long ago. I don't think so. Granted I am not basing my arguements against homosexuality on biblical or other religious text but I think to \"change\" religion to suit society is dangerous. Even if you don't believe in a particular religion I don't think its wise to alter its credo to conform to society any more than it would be correct to force a religion on an individual. You run the risk of invalidating the true message of the religion. Its kinda like the debate about censoring literature with curse words or racial epithets in them. Many may feel offended that Twain used the \"N\" word but to alter what is an important work of art and not just literature for sake of political correctness damages the social fabric of how society has evolved and changed through the generations. I cannot offer an easy method for Homosexual Christians to feel better about themselves, but the fact that the conflict exists means that a certain individual feels a loyalty to more than just his personal desires. That is a struggle they weigh individually. What is more important, their sexuality or being moral within the framework of Chrisitanity, or Judiaism, or Islam for that matter. Just because the Christians are more vocal doesn't mean they are the only ones that religiously object to homosexuality either, how about smacking up some of the other religions?\n\n \n You are right, these other religions also are the cause of depression in homosexuals, and are just as bad for that reason. The thing is, it isn't like you would have to rewrite their religious books just because you want equality, because all of them have passages that are now considered outdated and not strictly enforced, or enforced at all for that matter. There is also the fact that a religious book is a dangerous weapon, as people will do what it says, moral or not. A novel is not as dangerous, as few people seriously worship things they read in novels.\n \n \nWell that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating \"reorientation therapies\" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.\n\n \n There are blacks who wish there was a way to be white and vise versa. Many things that make people depressed are not disorders, it is simply something that happened that they didn't like because of something about them. Also, I think if you convinced a person who wanted to be a nationality they weren't that they were no longer that nationality, they would then be happier than before, making people think that it must make one happy to be the nationality this person thinks they have become.\n \n \nI didn't say that a homosexual was more likely to cheat than a heterosexual. What I alluded to was the fact that one indivdual was making a statement against moral values, when he neglects to recognize the root of said morals. The same values that say murder, adultry and theft are wrong are the same values that say homosexuality is wrong. \n\n \n Moral values in the sense of religious moral values are not good in debate, and religious moral values are the ones who list all of those as bad thing. The best thing to do is to stick to the reasons why this individual act is considered wrong.\n \n \nJust because its between two individuals doesn't mean no one else can be affected. You brought up how adultry is bad becaue it spreads disease. Hello, take a look at how many men have given their women AIDS from being on the \"DL\" and having gay sex. Homosexuality is capable of spreading and creating disease just like heterosexual sex, the difference is most heterosexuals that have sex with only their partner and are \"healthy\" are not at risk for an infection or condition that could be harmful to them by having sex. You cannot necessarily say that with homosexuals engaging in anal sex. Talk to a doctor about how damaging anal sex is and the different problems associated with anal penetration if you think I am joking. You don't see many cases of prolapsed rectums, and increases in rectal cancer due to vaginal sex. THe causality of those reactions to anal sex (within the male homosexual community) has been shown. Political correctness keeps most doctors hush hush about it though. Oh and BTW I do believe marriage is not just between two people who want to consolidate their finances. If adultry means what you said, then how come a marriage is not diissolved officially until a judge declares divorce? What about if the couple reconciles the adultry incident and continues on with their marriage? I think the nuances of adultry are more complicated then your simplistic understanding.\n\n \n I was saying that now marriages are more concerned about gender than love. Many married couples may also be in love, but many non married gay couples may be just as much in love. Plus, many people get married for publicity and not for love. Thus, the factor that is consistant in all marriages is not love, but gender and taxes. Adultry legally means nothing, just as love between two people legally means nothing, so legally the marriage is not over due to any matters of love and adultry. When the couple reconciles, they are basically saying that they still love each other so are promising again that they will love each other, and only each other, and believing that the promise will not be broken again.\n \n \nI'm not going to get into a religious debate, but I can appreciate someone taking a religious stance against it. Why do I think it is wrong? I think its wrong in the sense that it is treated as equal to heterosexualty. Its not, it cannot be, and that is no ones fault but natures. Nature doesn't allow homosexual sex to create life, to reproduce, and though humans use sex as entertainment, it obviously was meant for a greater purpose. Biology shows us we need both male and female to create life, that male and male doesn't create life, that indivdual gratification doesn't create life. If you want to attach relgious or philosophical significance to sex you may at this juncture. That is why I think it is wrong. Humanity wouldn't be around if homosexuality were the standard, homosexuals wouldn't exist without heterosexuals. You may be looking for a more fundamental \"morality\" to my basis. I choose to validate my beliefs on science and years of living proof of heterosexualitie's superiority, and when I mean hetero superiority I mean strict hetero adhearance, no socially unacceptable behavior being thrown in like \"cheating\" or \"rape\". \n\n \n No, I wasn't looking for religious morality, I was looking for general morality, so your argument was the kind I wanted to debate. Anyway, what is with people thinking that an activity that creates children is neccesarily a good thing? There are already a lot of people in the world, and too many more will end up using up all the food, and then there will no people, because we will all die an agonizing death of starvation. Heterosexuality is good, without any reproduction we would die out as well, but homosexuality is also very good and important because without enough non reproductive couples, the population would increase even more.\n \n \nAh but that is conjecture. At least in this country you cannot fully guage this becaue we have not had years of same sex marriage. Basically you are saying that homosexuals would be less likey to cheat on each other if same sex marriage were instituted. I'd like to see your supporting data on this. Take a look at some societies that have had same sex marriages for a while now and you might be surprised. In Sweden the rate of divorce amongst same sex couples surpasses heterosexual divorce. So sexual preference is no measure of security against adultry or cheating.\n\n \n There would still be adultry and cheating, just not any more than there was before. There would be a decreased number of people in denial of their sexuality, though, and so they would not get married to pretend to be what they are not. However, I believe that what is happening in Sweden is not linked to homosexual marriage, but a world wide trend of increasing divorce rates. I think two things are happening at once, and people are making the mistake of thinking that they are related and attacking one thinking it will end the other. However, I think that this will not work, because homosexuality and higher divorce rates are not corrolated, as higher divorce rates exist in countries that don't even have legalized gay marriage. Besides, one of the worst countries of all about divorce is the United States, and we are behind other countries in gay rights.\n \n http://www.divorcereform.org/nonus.html#anchor5599108\n http://www.glocom.org/special_topics/social_trends/20021007_trends_s10/\n \n \nNo, in Denmark, the rates of cohabilitation and out of wedlock births went up and heterosexual marriage is declining because the population sees the same sex marriage as an excuese to live lifestyles where traditional family is outdated. This is also happening in Sweden and Norway. Basically heteros see the society as so open that there is no longer any need for traditional family, that cohabilitation and single parent homes are just as acceptable as traditional marriage. If these countries are good indicators like they seem to be then other nations will follow the same route. I don't think that would be a positive thing for the U.S. or any nation for that matter. Right now what is known as the Norweigian Cohabilitation Syndrome is got its claws into Britian, where more individuals are having children with partners and living with them instead of marrying them. This syndrome is having a slow creep into the U.S. as well. Though there is not guarantee same sex marriage will not hasten this and other deteriorating family values, the trend is looking pretty bleak and hastening not slowing family disolution.\n\n \n This is only because people see homosexuality as completely anti-traditional marriage, and so they figure if they break one aspect of marriage, they might as well break them all. If people would look at it as a statement that marriage is for love, not gender, then this would not happen.\n \n \nHey if Denmark wants to limit their populations with these measures that is their business but where is the voice of those in Denmark that want better? Its been forced out by the homosexual agenda.This sounds Socio-fascist to me. Reproduction via artificial means is NEVER a first resort. It is a last resort for those that are having difficulty having children or unable to produce children through natural means. Its not a panacea and should never be treated as such. Ever read Brave New World? THe desire to curb accidental births is admirable but, who gets the responsibility. Some big brother government like in China where state sanctioned abortions is the way or do people get to have freewill over their reproductive rights.\n\n \n I was saying that if everyone decided that they wanted to be gay, it wouldn't be bad because we could do this. Homosexuality would not be enforced, and it wouldn't be the government regulating births. It would be private doctors, like gynocologists, who would help people become pregnant. People would still have complete control over their reproductive rights.\n \n \nAll you are suggesting is just another means of limiting choice in a world of shrinking choices. Its altruistic that you want everyone in the world to be fed but how about getting countries with crappy governments to take care of their populations first before you force other nations into a communist wealth sharing scheme. I'd love to see Castro stripped to the bone, if it meant the people of Cuba could live normal lives. Just throwing wealth at poverty is unwise, especially when the majority of these poor countries are run by \"fat cat\" potentates that rob their citizens of luxury and basic necessity.\n\n \n I wasn't saying that we should just throw wealth at poverty, I just mean that we should have enough food in the world that if they put some effort into getting some, they have something to be rewarded with. Homeless people can pull themselves up from poverty if they try, as long as there is something left for them to get. With high populations, everything ends up used up and there is nothing for them to try to earn.\n \n \nI also think your statement about children and parents is \"polyanna\" reasoning. There is no evidence to say that parents and children would somehow become closer through enforced or regulated reproduction. I'd like to see some data on that one. \n\n \n I'm not saying enforced or regulated reproduction, I'm saying intentional reproduction as opposed to accidental undesired births.\n \n \nAs for limiting hate crimes against gays, I would rather see hate crimes against gays be punished like any other \"hate crime\" and stop priveledging gays because someone commits an offense against them. An offense is an offense, sexuality may be the root cause but I don't think gays deserve a special preference over any other individual subjected to prejudical hate. All that does is send a message that one group of individuals deserves a special beneficance over another.\n\n \n I'm not saying they should be treated differently, I don't think that. What I was saying was that if everyone was magically gay, then there would be no hate crimes against gays. We'd still have to work on the other kinds of hate crimes. The best thing would not be to force people to be any one thing though, but to accept those that are. I simply was pointing out that if what happened in Denmark with almost everyone having gay marriage happened everywhere, it might not be so bad if it was a willing thing.\n \n \nAnd I would like to see corrolary data from you supporting your arguement that a smaller more controlled population would bring these issues under control. You may be right but I don't think your small collective would have much freewill in their society and I am definately no supporter of socialist societies. \n\n \n Why wouldn't they have free will? I'm not completely sure about less crime due to less people, I was simply thinkin that people wouldn't have anything to fight over if there was enough for everybody willing to do their part to gain it.\n \n \nAh but interracial marriages were only socially prejudiced. There was no real biological basis for the prejudice. We know that interracial diversity is biologically sound. Sometimes there are genetic or congenital anomollies that can be detrimental to the offspring of interracial couples, but these conditions do not preclude the validity of said relationships. You are trying to equate sexuality with racial diversity. This is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce. This trumps homosexuality's abilities two fold. \n\n \n Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?\n \n \nThis is a poor arguement for eugenics, population control and support of gay marriage. You could also replace an entire countries clothing with uniforms, that way everyone will dress alike and thus the risk of some poor soul being teased for looking \"different\" will be diminished. Don't see alot of demand for that. \n\n \n There is no harm in being teased for being different, so I see no reason to get rid of that. Besides, if no one can even come up with an explaination as to how they could tolerate heterosexual sex, much less enjoy it, they obviously can't want it so bad that they'd miss it too much anyway. I may have a slight, mild desire to mate with females, but it is not a desire I've ever acted on or neccisarily ever plan on acting on.\n \n \nThe idea that technology is going to save us by keeping our population in check is Orwellian if not Huxleyian and totally abhorent to most. Maybe you would gladly give up your right to reproduce for sake of a that has for the past 100 years never reached fruition. I don't see many people supporting your cause if it means destroying individual freedoms for the sake of a \"statist\" ideal. All this is Malthusian socialism. We eliminated that idea once we reached the industrial revolution. If we are so great with technology to use it so drastically like you claim, why not attempt to colonize another planet within our system or build underwater colonies. At least you are broadening horizions for future growth and not rigidly and fascistly usurping the future. \n\n \n I do not plan on rigidly or fascistly usurping the future, and to my knowledge some people have already been fertilized without mating. I am not saying to take away people's right to reproduce, they could be fertilized at any time. I was also not saying that people would now be required to be homosexual, I was simply saying if they all desired to be homosexual it would be useful. To my knowledge we cannot do the things you suggested, if we could I would support them.\n \n \n \nWell be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place. I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said \"minimal or negligable physical damage\".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is \n the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the \"peg\" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.\n\n \n I'm sorry, I was under the impression that in order to mate the male must insert his genetalia into the female's, which I happen to know is at least sometimes only one millimeter in diameter. I simply did not see how a female could desire this, and how it could not be extremely damaging. Also, with lesbian activities the peg does not matter if nothing is inserted, and nothing needs to be inserted between two females.\n \n \nAhem, maybe you better talk to a doctor about the differences in sexual trauma between vaginal sex and anal sex. Its alot more than \"ramming the peg in the vagina.\" as you so eloquently put it. In fact is not mainly an issue of penile force as much as it is the structures and purposes of say a vagina versus an anus. \n\n \n The structures of the vagina and the anus are similar, though, only the vagina is smaller in size. The female genetalia is perfectly round, like the anus, and both also have muscles around the edges to tighten and loosen the hole. There is only one difference, and that is that solid objects exit the anus on a regular basis, proving that they can fit.\n \n \nI didn't say reproduction was a bad thing.\n\n \n I never said you did, I think that.\n \n \nI think its a good thing and it does make the family superior and makes heterosexual behavior superior and right in my eyes. \n\n \n But it increases the population in and overpopulated world.\n \n \nI think \"reinventing\" the family to support cohabilitaing adults and homosexuals wishing to adopt and raise children is a bad thing. I don't like divorce or out of wedlock parenting, I consider them bad for marriage as much as I consider gay marriage to be.\n\n \n They are worse for marriage, as it implies the couple married without love.\n \n \nThe fact ot the matter is were discussing bans on gay marriage. Well, to be banned it would have to have been legal in the first place. Here in the states it never was so technically it cannot be banned yet. However I am not for legalizing gay marriage as I see it as an affront to heterosexual marriage and family and supporting ideals that to me are not productive to society. Nature may afford homosexual behavior, it is not that behavior that creates societey and life so therefore I don't recognize the claims of equality. Denmark serves as a great example becasue in their full acceptance of gay marriage they have sent a message that the traditional family is a negative thing, its passe and the incomplete family that so many were against for quite some time is now chique and acceptable. They tried to say in all the instances where gay marriage was accepted in society that heterosexual marriage was strengthed, but they failed seeing how low heterosexual marriage has fallen and the rate of single parent \"families\" and cohabilitations have risen along gay marriage. Maybe in Denmark the population will drop off in another decade or so, as less get married, maybe most will not have children. Then what of the future of Denmark? Maybe the government will get concerned and promote traditional marriage? Maybe they will abolsh gay marriage and things will repair themselves over time? Who knows, but its looking real bleak for Scandanavian states these days. Who knows how this will affect their cultural identity in the next generation.\n\n \n If people had legalized gay marriage before marriage had started falling apart, then we could have it without damaging marriages. What we need is marriage reforms against divorce, while supporting gay marriage, as to show that they are two different things. People need to be convinced that marriage needs to be preserved, even if there is homosexual marriage.",

   "First off I'm not a homophobic. Is everyone that disagrees wiht Judaism antisemtic? What is your definiton of homophobic?\n I do not spout doctrine. I share my views that I have logically proven. So if you condier it all doctrine and dismiss it all then of course it is not evident. I did the same to you there would be no debate because we'd jsut be dismissing each other's arguments.\n \n The fact that I showed-\n Homosexuality is not genetic\n Gay marriages degrade the institution\n Homosexuality is a disorder \n Recognizing disoprders such as homosexuality will lead to other disorders needing equality of recognition\n There is a public interest in not allowing gay marriage.\n They have equality because they have all rights afforded to anyone else.\n It isn't discrimination and if it is then the whole constitution is discriminatory.\n All laws are morally based and we as a society decide what is morally acceptable.\n Homosexuality is behavior and laws govern behavior not race, gender, abilities, etc.\n \n\n OK, first off, as you said, you don't agree that a homosexual lifestyle is right and should be legislated against (or at least not protected to the same way as heterosexual ones are). You are Homophobic as far as anyone in the UK would say- you don't like gays, fear is misleading term and these 'phobias' are not really about that. If you thought that jewish weddings should not be legal and that common jewish practices should be thought of as bad then I would say you are anti-semetic. \n \n Homosexuality being genetic is not certain, there isn't a gay gene in humans (though in other organsims) but there could be a gentic tendancy being the result of a combination of specific alleles across several genes.\n \n Gay marriage degrades the institution- no proof so far at all. Even the stats from denmark posted by someone else can be interpreted in a very different way- gay marriage was legalised becasue the population had a less opinion on the importance of 'traditional marraiges', hence fewer getting married. The actual legalisation of gay marriage had nothing to do with it. It also has nothing to do with the religious aspect as this is mopt beog forced on anyone, all that is happening is that two people of the same sex who wish to live together will gain protection and benefits from the law for doing so. Actual 'marriage' has very little to do with it which is more a relgious term, it just happens to be the name given to the set of rules that govern behaviours of which traditional marriage comes under.\n \n Homosexuality is not a disorder, plain and simple. Show some proof that genuine psychologists actual beleive this, if it was a disorder then this wouldn't even be an issue. Gay marriage would never have come up. It is unsual, yes, but it is not a mental disorder.\n \n See above.\n \n Depends how you define descimination and the act itself, we have been over this and taken it apart. If everyone has to follow shintoism and christianty is banned then there is no discrimination? If blacks can not enter white shops and whites can not enter black shops is this not discrimination?\n \n Last two points are irrelevant, can be argued either way. Should the majority always be able to impose on the minority, or should society step in to help those that are the minority?\n \n No proofs, just opinons.",

   " It is not a disorder, because it does not harm. In order for something to be considered a disorder it must be abnormal, maladaptive, and unjustifiable. You may define homosexuality as abnormal, and due to the low population of homosexuals it is abnormal, however it is not maladaptive. It is not adaptive, unless you consider the advantages due to the lowering of the population, but I do not see how it is maladaptive. What harm can come from it?\n\n homosexuality is maladaptive, abnormal, and condiered unjustifiable. It's not a consensus but it fits that defintion. Ask any colon or general instestinal specialist. Ask some obgyn about homosexuality.\n Homosexuality in public is obscene as is voyerism in public. Also it's considered non-conducive to the public interest.\n \n \n\n Also, those who seem to overcome it, whether they really do or not, are often more depressed afterwords. If anything, these people forcing themselves into a heterosexual relationship is a sign of disorder. To sleep with someone you are not attracted to is abnormal, and due to the depression it causes it is maladaptive. It is also unjustifiable to do this, as anyone would notice the inconsistancy of the bible if they believe it says that homosexuality is wrong. God is all loving, but then he damns gays to hell for all time, and they have no choice in the matter. How can someone not see that is unfair, and not very loving. Actually, my heterosexual friends would be more loving than him, as they are able to love homosexuals without even having the slightest desire to make them suffer because of it.\n\n First off you're making broad blacket statements. Just because some couldn't continue as heterosexuals doesn't mean everyone that has converted is experiencing all of those signs. Think of homosexuality in terms of any type of treatment. Some succeed and some don't. Those that succeed usually have some motivation such as families, religions, opportunities. Those that fail usually don't have much motivation.\n \n God is all loving. A parent loves all their children but hates their behavior that is unacceptable. God loves everyone, even me.\n \n \n \n\n How would this be consistant in its ruling? It would be ruling that any two consenting adults could marry. These behaviors do not fall under that same catagory, and if you think they are in anyway similar you are very wrong. The only similarity is that both are not considered sociably acceptable in this day in age, but many things we do today would once be considered unacceptable. When these things became acceptable, we did not suddenly say everything else, no matter how unrelated, should be considered okay in order to stay consistant, because it would be another issue entirely and consistancy would have nothing to do with it.\n\n Then polygamy is two consenting adults. One jsut happens to be married. Waht about relatives? Polygamy is considered more acceptable worldwide. Gay marriages are not considered acceptble in over 90% of the world population. Homosexuality is still considered not acceptable by the general population.",

   "\n Still, the definition of a family did change at one point.\n\n There is not proof of that. Only specualtions. If you believe in evolution thre is no prooof these family structures did not exist before humans. \n \n \n\n So changing the standards on how cars were made so that they would be less likely to stall was a negative thing? It is true that if you change your ideas too often without explaination, you loose respect, but if you refuse too often you become like glass. The reason glass breaks so easily is because it doesn't bend, so if too much force is applied to it, it shatters. If someone refuses to change their views, even when reason tries to force them to, they can't handle it.\n \n Not to mention the fact that the Christian Church has changed it views before, and it's still strong and respected. For example, did you know that the Christian Church once fought against interracial marriages? And that it used to be against women being seen as man's equal? If these views hadn't changed, the growing support of women's rights and interracial marriages would have smashed the church like a mirror.\n\n The car analogy is flawed because the standard is how it operates not what is done to meet those requirements.\n \n First off there is no \"Christian Church\". There are many. Some did change their views and I beleive they did lose credibility. It was more men than the Church itself imposing these views. Also not all of the Churches were opposed to it. It was mostly here in the US and the south and midwest.\n \n \n\n Yes, but change my example to something that is behavior, like watching Angel, and saying that the rights are the same for those who do and do not like the show, would that be fair to those who like the show?\n\n The people deem what is acceptable behavior. It favors the majority. Most of laws are made according to morals of the majority whcih happent to be Christian. It's not fair to the minority but it's the best we standard we can come up with. The laws can't violate the consittuion. So many things are subjective so the that is why we have checks and balances.",

   " I don't believe the majority use the term \"disorder\" when referring to homosexuality in nature.\n\n Since animal genetics and behavior is quite consitent when somehting deviates so far it's considered a disorder.\n \n \n \n\n I didn't say it wasn't true that heterosexuality is natural. Homosexuality is natural too. If homosexuality went against the law of nature, humans would not be able to violate that law.\n\n Laws of nature are physical laws. Disorders occur and we learn to deal wiht them. It does mean enable them more.\n \n \n \n \n\n Maybe you need to get out more. Does something being unusual make it good or bad?\n\n I'm referring to that it would be the exception not the norm.\n \n \n \n\n There are many reasons why people use condoms. It avoids disease(natural) and pregnancy. It also reduces sensation slightly which can delay climax. This makes the sexual act more pleasurable, but doesn't help reproduction.\n\n It still is enabling reproductive desires. These desires are based upon genetic desires that are in many ways still in the public interest.\n \n \n \n\n Even if the majority are not like that for perhaps all their lives? Even if it does not lead to reproduction?\n\n Yes becaue it is the basic element that encourages us to build families.\n \n \n \n\n Children deserve to know that their relationships with both of their parents are stable and legally recognized. This applies to all children, whether their parents are of the same or opposite sex. The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes that a considerable body of professional literature provides evidence that children with parents who are homosexual can have the same advantages and the same expectations for health, adjustment, and development as can children whose parents are heterosexual.1-9 When 2 adults participate in parenting a child, they and the child deserve the serenity that comes with legal recognition. \n http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3b109/2/339\n\n You're going to live and die on what the board of the APA says, regardless if it sin't a general consensus. If they ever changed their position you'll have no legitimicay.\n Heterosexual parenting is the normative model upon which most comprehensive longitudinal research on childrearing has been based. Data on long-term outcomes for children placed in homosexual households are very limited and the available evidence reveals grave concerns. Those current studies that appear to indicate neutral to favorable results from homosexual parenting have critical flaws such as non-longitudinal design, inadequate sample size, biased sample selection, lack of proper controls, and failure to account for confounding variables.2,3,4 Childrearing studies have consistently indicated that children are more likely to thrive emotionally, mentally, and physically in a home with two heterosexual parents versus a home with a single parent. 5,6,7,8,9 Therefore, the burden is on the proponents of homosexual parenting to prove that moving further away from the heterosexual parenting model is appropriate and safe for children.\n \n Risks of Homosexual Lifestyle to Children\n \n Violence among homosexual partners is two to three times more common than among married heterosexual couples. 10,11,12,13,14 Homosexual partnerships are significantly more prone to dissolution than heterosexual marriages with the average homosexual relationship lasting only two to three years. 15,16,17 Homosexual men and women are reported to be inordinately promiscuous involving serial sex partners, even within what are loosely-termed \"committed relationships.\" 18,19,20,21,22 Individuals who practice a homosexual lifestyle are more likely than heterosexuals to experience mental illness,23,24,25 substance abuse,26 suicidal tendencies,27,28 and shortened life spans.29 Although some would claim that these dysfunctions are a result of societal pressures in America, the same dysfunctions exist at inordinately high levels among homosexuals in cultures were the practice is more widely accepted.30 Children reared in homosexual households are more likely to experience sexual confusion, practice homosexual behavior, and engage in sexual experimentation. 31,32,33,34,35 Adolescents and young adults who adopt the homosexual lifestyle, like their adult counterparts, are at increased risk of mental health problems, including major depression, anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, substance dependence, and especially suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.36\n \n Conclusion\n \n The research literature on childrearing by homosexual parents is limited. The environment in which children are reared is absolutely critical to their development. Given the current body of research, the American College of Pediatricians believes it is inappropriate, potentially hazardous to children, and dangerously irresponsible to change the age-old prohibition on homosexual parenting, whether by adoption, foster care, or by reproductive manipulation. This position is rooted in the best available science.\n \n http://www.acpeds.org/?CONTEXT=art&cat=22&art=50&BISKIT=2920801063\n \n \n \n \n\n No, not slaves to anything. But this doesn't make something right or wrong, including with being gay. \n\n AT least we agree desires doesn't dictate necessity or it's acceptance. \n \n \n \n\n If that is true, it doesn't mean humans necessarily have a need for the particular structure of Christianity.\n\n No but it has been shown that prayer is beneficial.\n \n \n \n \n\n But not necessarily through reproduction. How they've tied it into with Darwin's, is to say that those who engage in kin selection help others to reproduce by acting as helpers, without reproducing themselves.\n\n THey do help reproduce. Do gays do that? It's always in the best interest of the specie to help the group for the sacrifice of the few.\n \n \n \n\n Your thoughts can create your mental condtion.\n\n Yeah they can lead to it. Still religion is not mental condition.\n \n \n \n\n I'm glad most others today encourage people to accept themselves.\n\n How do you what they are? What if they're pedophiles?\n \n \n \n\n Who is being complacent?\n\n Anyone that doesn't continue to improve.\n \n \n \n\n He's obsessed with the idea he is going to hell, because of what he has been taught. Apparently God put him into this marriage of his where he doesn't care for his wife, but God isn't responsible for him being gay. I'll come back with a link for religious addiction. It concerns an obsession with rules, and not thinking for one's self, with being perfect. Everything is black and white, heaven or hell. I just basically advised him to get therapy for that, and other issues. Then he attacked me, and won't speak to me or anyone else who was trying to give him advice(Christians), because he can't handle criticism of anything that challenges his particular viewpoint. After all, it's God's plan for him that he should be miserable denying who he is. He even said dying may be the only cure for being gay. He's tried and tried not to be gay. I don't know how God would expect to be served if God puts the person in an inescpable situation where the person is so depressed that the person wants to die. I really did not try to push my lack of religion onto him. I told him he was just using his own religion in a destructive way, and the problem was not with religion itself. \n\n That is not an example of religious addiction. That is an example of a religious man struggling with problems. \n \n If you talk to him like those anti-religious gay sites write about God, I wouldn't talk to you either.\n \n I have a hard time beleive it's exactly teh way you describe it. Do you mind If I contacted him?\n \n \n \n\n I really don't think his problems are because he is not as successful as the heterosexual. He certainly has tried to \"succeed\" at being something he is not. \n\n So if he fails then he wasn't meant to suceed?",

   " OK, first off, as you said, you don't agree that a homosexual lifestyle is right and should be legislated against (or at least not protected to the same way as heterosexual ones are). You are Homophobic as far as anyone in the UK would say- you don't like gays, fear is misleading term and these 'phobias' are not really about that. If you thought that jewish weddings should not be legal and that common jewish practices should be thought of as bad then I would say you are anti-semetic. \n\n No there are people in the Uk that agree with me. Also I neve said I didn't liek gays. I don't agree with their lifestyle but i'm not afraid of it. Thanks for assuming though. I do feel Jewish wedding should be legal. I do not agree wiht their doctrine though. Keep digging though for some basis to call me homomphobic and to make an accurate analogy.\n \n \n \n\n Homosexuality being genetic is not certain, there isn't a gay gene in humans (though in other organsims) but there could be a gentic tendancy being the result of a combination of specific alleles across several genes.\n\n No proof of that. Also predispostion doesn't mean the tendency has to be accommodated.\n Also there is not gay gene in other species just simple organisms that aren't even close to comparable to humans.\n \n \n\n Gay marriage degrades the institution- no proof so far at all. Even the stats from denmark posted by someone else can be interpreted in a very different way- gay marriage was legalised becasue the population had a less opinion on the importance of 'traditional marraiges', hence fewer getting married. The actual legalisation of gay marriage had nothing to do with it. It also has nothing to do with the religious aspect as this is mopt beog forced on anyone, all that is happening is that two people of the same sex who wish to live together will gain protection and benefits from the law for doing so. Actual 'marriage' has very little to do with it which is more a relgious term, it just happens to be the name given to the set of rules that govern behaviours of which traditional marriage comes under.\n\n There is proof of that. Civil unions in Vertmont are divorcing. Also it has helped to trivialize marriage by not lowering the standards.\n \n \n \n\n Homosexuality is not a disorder, plain and simple. Show some proof that genuine psychologists actual beleive this, if it was a disorder then this wouldn't even be an issue. Gay marriage would never have come up. It is unsual, yes, but it is not a mental disorder.\n\n I do not have the space to go into a detailed analysis of the history leading up to the APA's decision.15 Nonetheless, it is a misconception to think that this came about only after dispassionate and scholarly discussion, and only after listening equally to all sides of the issue. Also, it is important to note that the APA's vote was anything but unanimous. \n \n Dr. Robert Spitzer, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University in New York, contributed to the 1973 decision by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders. However, after talking with ex-gays, he decided to do a study. He presented his paper May 9, 2001 at the annual meeting of APA in New Orleans. In summary, he writes: \"The subjects' self-reports of change appear to be, by and large, valid, rather than gross exaggerations, brainwashing or wishful thinking. We therefore conclude that some individuals who participate in a sexual-reorientation therapy apparently make sustained changes in sexual orientation.\"\n \n http://www.inoohr.org/apa.htm\n \n \n See above.\n \n\n Depends how you define descimination and the act itself, we have been over this and taken it apart. If everyone has to follow shintoism and christianty is banned then there is no discrimination? If blacks can not enter white shops and whites can not enter black shops is this not discrimination?\n\n Tasty why do you make analogies taht aren't well thought out and not well are not even similar to our situation?\n \n The religon analogy is there is no individual discrimination only religious discrimination.\n \n White man rights- white store\n \n black man- black store\n \n same? No\n \n Straight man- marry woman\n \n Gay man- marry woman \n \n same? yes\n \n Tasty please email me your analogies first so I can give you feedback before you psot them.\n \n \n\n Last two points are irrelevant, can be argued either way. Should the majority always be able to impose on the minority, or should society step in to help those that are the minority?\n\n The majority should always ensure the minrotiy has equal rights. However the majority decides what is acceptable behavior. \n \n \n\n No proofs, just opinons. \n\n I noticed",

Keep digging though for some basis to call me homomphobic and to make an accurate analogy.\n I know there are people in the UK who agree with you, but they are in a much greater minority then in the US and are far more isolated to the extremes (generally the older population and those who already have extreme fringe groups). So you like gays, but just don't think they should be treated equally and be allowed to choose the lifestyle you want- some friend you are. You oppose gay rights and consider it a mental disorder, that fits quite well into the common defintion of homophobic.

Also it has helped to trivialize marriage by not lowering the standards\n\n Are these civil unions divorcing at the same rate as non relgioius marriages? Do we mean civil union as purely gay marriage as well, the term changes from place to place? Not sure if you looked at the stats compared to marriages between non religious people it would be very different. And how does someone else divorcing reduce the chance you will stay with your partner?\n \n \n \n \n\n Tasty why do you make analogies taht aren't well thought out and not well are not even similar to our situation?\nmeh, everyone else gets too, felt it was my turn.\n \n\n The religon analogy is there is no individual discrimination only religious discrimination.\n White man rights- white store\n black man- black store\n same?

   "homosexuality is maladaptive, abnormal, and condiered unjustifiable. It's not a consensus but it fits that defintion. Ask any colon or general instestinal specialist. Ask some obgyn about homosexuality.\n Homosexuality in public is obscene as is voyerism in public. Also it's considered non-conducive to the public interest.\n\n \n Okay, you've only proved that homosexuality is maladaptive in males just now, and only then if they mate. Also, there is a lot of harmful behavior that is worse than that that is not considered a disorder, like playing football. You can be injured doing that, but as it doesn't fit under the other two catagories, it is not considered a disorder. Homosexual intercourse is justifiable, it would be unjustifiable to expect two people in love to never have a physical relationship.\n \n \nFirst off you're making broad blacket statements. Just because some couldn't continue as heterosexuals doesn't mean everyone that has converted is experiencing all of those signs. Think of homosexuality in terms of any type of treatment. Some succeed and some don't. Those that succeed usually have some motivation such as families, religions, opportunities. Those that fail usually don't have much motivation.\n\n \n Yes, but you can not prove that they are no longer homosexual, just that they no longer act on what they desire.\n \n \nGod is all loving. A parent loves all their children but hates their behavior that is unacceptable. God loves everyone, even me.\n\n \n Yes, but a loving parent does not make rules for no reason. There has to be some way that it is harmful to someone for it to be unacceptable. Also, they wouldn't make a rule against some slightly harmful behavior without making rules against more harmful behavior, like spending all your time watching sports or playing football, which can cause injuries. Or going to a Catholic Church, did you know that all that kneel sit stand stuff can cause damage to your kneecaps?\n \n \nThen polygamy is two consenting adults. One jsut happens to be married. Waht about relatives? Polygamy is considered more acceptable worldwide. Gay marriages are not considered acceptble in over 90% of the world population. Homosexuality is still considered not acceptable by the general population.\n\n \n Polygamy is between more than two consenting adults, because everyone in the marriage is married to more than one person. Relatives may end up getting married, but they are just as likely to if gays can or can not get married. After all, if two relatives fall in love they can fight for it just as well with or without gay marriage. Personally, I don't think gay marriage has any effect on it, because if it gets enough support we will end up with it, gay marriage being legal or not.",

   "You're going to live and die on what the board of the APA says, regardless if it sin't a general consensus. If they ever changed their position you'll have no legitimicay.\n Heterosexual parenting is the normative model upon which most comprehensive longitudinal research on childrearing has been based. Data on long-term outcomes for children placed in homosexual households are very limited and the available evidence reveals grave concerns. Those current studies that appear to indicate neutral to favorable results from homosexual parenting have critical flaws such as non-longitudinal design, inadequate sample size, biased sample selection, lack of proper controls, and failure to account for confounding variables.2,3,4 Childrearing studies have consistently indicated that children are more likely to thrive emotionally, mentally, and physically in a home with two heterosexual parents versus a home with a single parent. 5,6,7,8,9 Therefore, the burden is on the proponents of homosexual parenting to prove that moving further away from the heterosexual parenting model is appropriate and safe for children.\n \n Risks of Homosexual Lifestyle to Children\n \n Violence among homosexual partners is two to three times more common than among married heterosexual couples. 10,11,12,13,14 Homosexual partnerships are significantly more prone to dissolution than heterosexual marriages with the average homosexual relationship lasting only two to three years. 15,16,17 Homosexual men and women are reported to be inordinately promiscuous involving serial sex partners, even within what are loosely-termed \"committed relationships.\" 18,19,20,21,22 Individuals who practice a homosexual lifestyle are more likely than heterosexuals to experience mental illness,23,24,25 substance abuse,26 suicidal tendencies,27,28 and shortened life spans.29 Although some would claim that these dysfunctions are a result of societal pressures in America, the same dysfunctions exist at inordinately high levels among homosexuals in cultures were the practice is more widely accepted.30 Children reared in homosexual households are more likely to experience sexual confusion, practice homosexual behavior, and engage in sexual experimentation. 31,32,33,34,35 Adolescents and young adults who adopt the homosexual lifestyle, like their adult counterparts, are at increased risk of mental health problems, including major depression, anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, substance dependence, and especially suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.36\n \n Conclusion\n \n The research literature on childrearing by homosexual parents is limited. The environment in which children are reared is absolutely critical to their development. Given the current body of research, the American College of Pediatricians believes it is inappropriate, potentially hazardous to children, and dangerously irresponsible to change the age-old prohibition on homosexual parenting, whether by adoption, foster care, or by reproductive manipulation. This position is rooted in the best available science.\n \n http://www.acpeds.org/?CONTEXT=art&cat=22&art=50&BISKIT=2920801063\n\n \n \n Thank you so much for these misrepresented statistics from the board of directors of this not so prestigious, 2 year old, right-wing political organization. What was I thinking posting from the American Academy of Pediatrics?\n \n I just love the part where they state that homosexual partnerships are more prone to breaking up, compared to heterosexual marriage. Do all heterosexuals marry the first person they have a partnership with?\n \n Oh, and what a surprise, heterosexual marriages last longer than the average gay relationship! Just like in my previous example, this is an apples and oranges comparison. Not all heterosexuals who are in relationships are married. \n \n They also cited the Bell and Weinberg study from the 1970's. Gay men in sex clubs and gay singles bars and gay book stores were interviewed, and found to be promiscuous. The heterosexuals surveyed were from residential areas, some included married couples. In order for the samples to be comparable they would have to survey heterosexuals from hetero singles bars, hetero sex clubs, and hetero book stores. For all we know their findings could have indicated what life was like for the average single person in San Fran in the 1970's. \n \n Also, some other studies were misrepresented.\n \n For example, the claims of more domestic violence in gay relationships cites the Island and Letellier study. It's authors have shown how they were quoted completely out of context by right-wing anti-gay groups...\n \n http://www.afaexposed.com/a_letellier.html\n \n Also the authors of the original study on gay life expectancy have had their study misrepresented by anti-gay groups, as the authors show in this article in the International Journal of Epidemiology...\n \n http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1499\n \n \nThat is not an example of religious addiction. That is an example of a religious man struggling with problems.\n\n \n Obsessed with the idea that he is going to hell if he doesn't follow all the rules, wanting to die because he sees it as the only \"cure\"? Attacks anyone who questions his beliefs. That indicates a problem with religion. \n \n \nIf you talk to him like those anti-religious gay sites write about God, I wouldn't talk to you either.\n\n \n He has a wide diversity of opinions presented to him. I did not attack religion as I wrote previously. I told him he had to consider that he was using religion in a destructive way.\n \n \nI have a hard time beleive it's exactly teh way you describe it. Do you mind If I contacted him?\n\n \n Yes, it really is. It shows the dark side of the ex-gay \"program\". You are the last person he needs to talk to. What would you tell him, to keep going on the path he's going on? To keep trying something that has not worked. Stay miserable so that you want to die, because God wants you in that situation, or God can magically make you feel better or heterosexual if you simply have a little more faith and pray just a little more? What would you tell this person? How would you defend the ex-gay \"program\"? I'm thinking maybe nothing could make things worse for him, but I still hesitate to give you his email.",

   "Wow, I am surprised that an organization like the American College of Pediatricians would take such a strong stand like that. And with so little research done in the area. \n \n Ignoring the studies for just a second, I would expect a tendency for more instability in homosexual families because they are not institutionalized. A leading family sociologist, Andrew Cherlin, argues that one reason why stepfamilies are not as stable as intact families is that there is no rich tradition indicating what the guidelines are for stepfamilies. For example, what are the roles for a stepmother and an at-home stepchild? These families figure it out on a case-by-case basis since the stepfamily is not very institutionalized. These families tend to have more conflict and instability as a result. \n \n If homosexual couples are having or are caring for children without being married to each other, if Cherlin is right, those children may tend to do more poorly under current conditions and while homosexual marriage is new, but they would do much better in the future (maybe decades) once gay marriage was institutionalized. \n \n Another hunch I have, and it is just that, is that lesbian relationships would tend to be stable, maybe even as much or more than with heterosexual couples, because it is two women involved in a relationship. Women tend to be more commmitment-oriented. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see children do quite well in many of these homes. On the other hand, men tend to be less commitment-oriented and are, on average, less devoted to children, and I could easily see a high level of instability in these relationships. If I were a gay male and all my partners liked sex and independence as much as I naturally do, this does not seem to be a recipe for the long-term commitment that children demand. Of course, I am generalizing, and there would be many exceptions. \n \n As for the relevant studies I have run across, I have seen research showing more domestic violence among gay men, but once again, we are talking about two men, and men tend to be more violent than women. In addition, research indicates that the average cohabiting couple lives together between 18 and 24 months, and roughly half break up, the other half get married (and then half of those eventually divorce). So these numbers indicate a level of relationship instability that is apparently not much different from the gay couples as reported by that website, especially given the fact that gay couples do not have the stabilizing effects of institutionalized marriage.",

We therefore conclude that some individuals who participate in a sexual-reorientation therapy apparently make sustained changes in sexual orientation.\"\n \n http://www.inoohr.org/apa.htm\n\n \n Here is more about Spitzer's unpublished study, and its sample, including what Spitzer himself has to say about it...\n \n He was disappointed, however, that many reports overlooked his statements explaining that his sample was limited and that he was not maintaining that a substantial number of gays and lesbians could become straight if they sought reparative therapy. \"For the vast majority it is not possible for them to change their sexual orientation,\" he said. \n \n Spitzer also acknowledged that \"a lot of people will misuse\" his findings, which could cause pain for many individuals. \"It may help 5,000 people, but harm 500,000,\" he said. He is concerned, he added, that \"the Christian right,\" with its intolerance of and opposition to homosexuality, will use his findings in its campaign to prevent gays and lesbians from gaining civil rights protections. \n \n http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/36/13/20\n \n Spitzer learned from Stalstrom that his study was being misused-an outcome about which he has been concerned since his study was publicized last spring. He then wrote to Karkkainen, the lawmaker leading the charge against the bill, saying that he was \"disturbed\" that his study results were being \"misused by those who are against antidiscrimination laws and civil unions for gays and lesbians.\" \n \n Spitzer explained that while his study results run counter \"to the current view of most mental health professionals,\" who maintain that homosexuals cannot change their sexual orientation, his report was \"based on a very unique sample.\" Such results \"are probably quite rare, even for highly motivated homosexuals,\" he said. \n \n He added in his letter to the parliament member that \"it would be a serious mistake to conclude\" from his research that homosexuality is a \"choice.\" \n \n He emphasized that he is concerned with \"scientific issues\" related to sexual orientation, and that he \"personally favor[s] antidiscrimination laws and civil unions for homosexuals.\" \n \n In an interview with Psychiatric News, Spitzer also rejected the argument made by Finnish opponents of civil unions, as well as some people who hailed his study results earlier this year, that the decision to remove homosexuality as a DSM-III diagnosis was a political decision in which APA succumbed to pressure from gay groups and their allies in the profession. That argument is \"nonsense,\" he emphasized. \"Both sides of the controversy were convinced that science was on their side\" when they made their decision. \n \n http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/36/24/11\n \n It had taken Spitzer more than 18 months to find just 200 or so people willing to describe themselves as successfully converted. He found his interviewees by advertising through ex-gay organisations. Almost half were recruited through ex-gay ministries, and nearly a quarter by Narth. Religion was \"extremely\" or \"very\" important to 93% of them. One in five was a mental health professional (Cohen, for example, is a high-profile reparative therapist) or director of an ex-gay ministry, and more than three-quarters had previously lobbied for sexual reorientation. These are people who get paid to say that therapy works. \n \n For many critics, this alone was enough to discredit the exercise. An article in the APA's Psychiatric News likened it to testing a drug on people recruited by the pharmaceutical company. But in addition, many of the participants appeared to have been not so much altered from gay to straight, as bisexual all along. Ten per cent of the men had never had gay sex before therapy, whereas half had already slept with a woman. Only a third of the women and half the men said that before therapy they were \"extremely\" bothered by homosexual feelings. How gay were they? \n \n As with most statistics, everything depends on how they are read. The percentage who were \"extremely bothered\" by homosexual feelings after undergoing therapy fell to zero. You could say zero was a sensational turnaround; or you might say they weren't so gay in the first place. Two New York psychologists carried out another study of reparative therapy at the same time as Spitzer, and reached the opposite conclusion. \"We interviewed 182 people who tried very hard to change,\" Dr Ariel Shidlo told Newsweek. \"The stakes were really high for them. Some really thought that if they didn't change, they would literally find themselves in hell... And they still failed.\" \n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1183596,00.html\n \n Drescher is concerned about the harm that patients can suffer after going through some of the conversion therapies, an issue not addressed in Spitzer's selective patient sample. \n \n \"Religious reparative therapies, like the faith healing from which they are derived, are a treatment modality that purports to provide definitive answers regarding human nature and sexuality. They always define homosexuality as wrong and require that individuals trying to change their sexual orientation submit to the therapist's authority as a condition of treatment,\" he said in his annual meeting presentation. \n \n In the type of interventions Spitzer assessed, \"it is the client's compliance with the therapist's authority, rather than the therapist's interpretations, that will determine the outcome of treatment,\" Drescher suggested. \"This is a clinical stance with troubling ethical implications.\"\n \n http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/36/13/20",

Other things are different from homosexuality, and will have their unique standards, regardless of whether or not we accept gay people. If these others want to fight to have their relationships equally recognized, they will do so regardless of whether or not we accept gay relationships.

Here you go.\n Tell me how it's out of context?\n \n Colossians Chapter 3\n 5 Mortify\u0095 therefore your members\u0095 which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:\n \n 2 Timothy\n \n 1 THIS know also, that in the last\u0095 days perilous times\u0095 shall come. \n 2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, acovetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,\n 3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false\u0095 accusers, incontinent\u0095, fierce, despisers of those that are good, \n \n \n \n \n\n Well, straight people may come into the offices of various specialists about problems. That's their business. If a gay person or a straight person goes into see a colon specialist, for whatever reason, that's their business. Being gay, doesn't mean you will have to see a colon specialist. For what? Anal sexual activity? Not all gays do that, but have a wide variety of activities. Some heterosexuals do this. Not everyone who does that form of penetration will experience problems, just as with other forms of penetration. It depends on how one does it. And I restate, that it is only the business of those engaged in the activity. \n\n Of course not every person engaged in homosexuality will have these problems. There is a high level of problems related to this type of behavior. This type of behvior leads to many problems.\n Anyways I made my point. There is harm. Taht is why you cna't donate blood as a homosexual male for five years.\n \n \n\n Those polling numbers constantly change.

Over the 1998-2002 5 year period, the average new cases went up 83 cases for male-male contact, it went up 181 cases for male heterosexual contact, and 235 additional cases each year for female heterosexual contact. With around 42,000 new AIDS cases each year, the slightly higher numbers for heterosexuals is not very significant. \n \n As of 2002, 45% of the total new cases were from male-male contact (or not being able to tell if it was male-male sex or sharing needles). At this pace, heterosexuals are NEVER going to catch up and contract AIDS at the rates  homosexuals do. A tiny group of Americans produces 45% of all new cases; heterosexual rates will never be that high. \n \n Another way of looking at it is to calculate what percentage of people are living with HIV/AIDS. The CDC doesn't give those numbers (that I could see) so I calculated and found that it is 4.97% of male homosexuals, and .09% for everyone else. That .09% is never ever going to catch up.\n \n While the risk of infection is 55 times higher for a male homosexual (4.97%/.09%) than everyone else, it is still a small minority of homosexuals that suffer from the disaese.

   "It is sooo easy to eat cheesy. I think it is a serious mistake to equate acceptance of homosexuality with acceptance of gay marriage. It is one thing to say homosexuality is not big deal so \"live and let live,\" and quite another to be in favor of the state enshrining the lifestyle with a marriage license. The function of legal marriage is for society to formally say that we hold this union up as special and the preferable arrangement for adults. It's function is not to say since we don't really have serious problems with your lifestyle, here's a license. \n \n By the way, I want to amend an earlier post. I was arguing that homosexual relationships don't appear to be much more unstable than for heterosexuals. I later realized that I completely left out all heteros that marry without living together first (BIG error). \n \n Roughly half of heteros entering a serious relationship marry with out living together first; half of those never divorce. The average person marries at 26 and dies at 76, so these marriages are an average of 50 years. The average marriage that ends in divorce last an average of 7 years. As I wrote before, hetero cohabitors do three things; one half break up in an average of 20 months; one quarter eventually marry and divorce in 7 years average; and one quarter marry and never divorce, having an average marriage of 50 years. \n \n Doing all the calculations, the average hetero relationship lasts 21.8 years. The number is so high since one-third of heteros--whether or not cohabiting first--never divorce and are married for 50 years. So if the one study is correct that the average gay relationship lasts say 2 years, then we can validly conclude that while heteros currently have their share of problems, they are, on average, much more stable than homosexual relationships. Of course heteros have the advantage of having marriage available to them which is more binding than just living together, but these days the binding force of marriage does little to stop unsatisfied people from splitting up.",

As near as I can tell, there's only one difference, and it's how you're taxed. The state doesn't really care whether you love each other, whether you have children, how old each partner is, what religion you ascribe to, etc, etc... \n \n The state only cares that both partners are freely entering into what for all intents and purposes is nothing more than legal contract. That contract entitles you to certain benefits and tax credits, as you are now viewed as \"one entity\" rather than two individuals. \n \n Call it a marriage, call it a legal union, call it cheese, it doesn't matter to matter to me, but I just can't wrap my head around denying another person STATE BENEFITS (their tax dollars) based on their sexual orientation.\n \n I agree with your definition of a marriage as it pertains to religious beliefs. Each faith should be free to define marriage as it so chooses. I don't think state recognized marriages are a threat to the religious sacrament of marriage in any way.

   "That's funny. You want to emulate Thomas Jefferson? Do you wish you were a slave-owner like him?\n\n JPSartre12's joke was the appropriate response to this post, but at the risk of being the wet blanket, let me make a comment. This is such a cheap shot to judge a man who live 200 years ago by currently accepted standards. A hypothetical example will put this in context. (Context is a foreign word to left-leaning people). \n \n One of the contemporary heroes of the Left is Noam Chomsky. He is a brilliant linguist, and he has been a articulate champion of the leftist ideals and causes for several decades. Yet while many people in his political persuasion are vegetarian, he is a meat eater. Chomsky himself has said that say 100 years from now, most if not all people may be vegetarian. \n \n I don't think it is an unlikely scenario at all that the time may come in the not-too-distant when the PETA view of animals comes to be embraced and accepted as matter of fact by people. In their view, killing animals to eat them or to wear their skins or fur is the worst kind of barbarism. They have called it a holocaust like what the Nazis did. Killing creatures that we share more than 90% of our DNA with is mass murder, and people with any decency will fight against it. It may very well be the case that 100 years from now organizations like PETA will be seen as modern-day abolitionists. \n \n So put yourself in that future world. What should our attitude be toward Noam Chomsky? He feasted on the bloody flesh of thousands of animals and wore leather shoes his whole life. Apologists can't use the excuse that Chomsky didn't know any better; he was very familiar with PETA's arguments and had many friends who were vegetarians. Will we have to conclude that he is not a hero but a villian, a monster, a serial murderer? \n \n No we will not, because right now in this time we can see how a very smart man like Chomsky does not look at the state of affairs like PETA people today do, or like everyone would take for granted a 100 years from now. He understands their point of view, and has some sympathy for it, but he is not convinced of their viewpoint. Of course now we look at slavery with horror, but that simply was not the worldview of the time. Yes, there was some feeling then and some people that felt that slavery was wrong, but it was not a taken-for-granted principle like it is for us today.\n \n It is the mistake of a child to think that everybody always sees things like you do. An example would be cover a young child's eyes who is watching TV with you and to ask him what daddy sees now. The child then says, \"That's easy Daddy, you can't see anything.\" It is impossible of course for people of the past to believe in worldviews they were never a part of.",

I think \"stylish\" is much more complimentary and accurate. \"Hey, you wanna meet up at the stylish bar later for drinks?\"\n \n In my view, family arrangements are very consequential while slang trends are not. Family is arguably THE critical institution in society, so revolutionizing it will have a much wider and deeper impact on people, for good or for bad, than language trends. \n \n One of the most profound changes in American society in the last 50 years has been the movement of women into the workplace; some people argue that this has been a good thing, others say a bad thing. My point here is that this one change, which probably seemed like an unimportant switch among the women who first decided to break the norm and get a job, has revolutionized society in many ways.

I am leery of just doing Internet searches, since you're apt to get info from advocacy sites. As for articles of any relevance, I could only find research done by one guy--Paul Cameron, who clearly has an agenda. I will say that, on the surface at least, the methods on these studies look okay. Psychological Reports is a reputable peer-reviewed journal, and I can't imagine them publishing anti-homosexual research unless the methods were satisfactory. Anyway, take it for what it's worth (forgive the length):\n \n \n Title: HOMOSEXUAL PARTNERSHIPS AND HOMOSEXUAL LONGEVITY: A REPLICATION. \n Authors: Cameron, Paul \n Source: Psychological Reports; Oct2002, Vol. 91 Issue 2, p671, 8p, 1 chart \n \n Abstract: Replicating previous findings that homosexuals are underrepresented after middle age, the 1996 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse (N= 12,381) and 2000 Kaiser Family Foundation 15-city survey (N=405) reported that homosexual men and women are seldom aged 50+ yr. and that older homosexuals are more apt to have a homosexual partner. Deaths of 228 homosexuals as recorded in the Washington Blade 1999-2001 were examined. Although more apt to have a partner when older, the median age of death of 88 homosexually partnered men was 45 yr., while for 118 unpartnered homosexual men it was 46 yr. This is consistent with the suggestion that homosexual partnering may be an additional hazard to men. \n \n \n HOMOSEXUAL PARENTS IN CUSTODY DISPUTES A THOUSAND CHILD-YEARS EXPOSURE. \n Authors: Cameron, Paul1\n Harris, David W.1 \n Source: Psychological Reports; Dec2003 Part 2, Vol. 93 Issue 3, p1173, 22p \n \n Abstract: Through 1998, 78 custody appeal decisions involving 79 homosexual parents were evaluated. The 142 children involved in these cases were exposed to a thousand child-years of homosexual parenting. In appeals records (a) parents recorded as lying or engaging in criminality or homosexuality were more apt to be recorded as harming children; (b) homosexuals more frequently were recorded as lying or engaging in criminality; (c) in 54 (70%) disputes the homosexual parent or his associates and in 4 (5%) the heterosexual parent was recorded as having exposed the children to harm(s), e.g., neglect, seduction; and (d) homosexuals were responsible for 111 (97%) of the 115 recorded harms to children. For 78 nonhomosexual vs nonhomosexual control cases, in 11 (14%) the 141 children were exposed to 12 harms. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] \n \n \n Title: DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AMONG HOMOSEXUAL PARTNERS. \n Authors: Cameron, Paul1 \n Source: Psychological Reports; Oct2003, Vol. 93 Issue 2, p410, 7p \n \n Abstract: Is domestic violence more frequent in homosexual partnerships? The 1996 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse, based upon a random sample of 12,381 adults aged 18 to 59 years, estimated that 828,900 men and 828,678 women engaged in homosexuality in the prior 12 months. Random surveys indicated that at any given time, 29% of homosexual men and 32% of homosexual women are in same-sex partnerships. The National Criminal Victimization Survey for 1993 to 1999 reported that 0.24% of married women and 0.035% of married men were victims of domestic violence annually versus 4.6% of the men and 5.8% of the women reporting same-sex partnerships. Domestic violence appears to be more frequently reported in same-sex partnerships than among the married. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] \n \n \n HOMOSEXUAL PARENTS IN BRITISH CUSTODY APPEALS. \n Authors: Cameron, Paul \n Source: Psychological Reports; Apr2003, Vol. 92 Issue 2, p379, 8p \n \n Abstract: 6 British child custody appeal cases including a homosexual parent were compared with 6 randomly drawn appeal cases between heterosexual parents for parental and mental instability, partners' instability, residential instability, criminality, and lying, and having harmed the children and exposing children to harms. In 3 of the 6 cases the homosexual or his associates were recorded as engaging in criminality, in another 2 cases with lying. In one of the 6 homosexual cases the children were recorded as harmed. The 9 recorded harms or probable harms to children in cases involving a homosexual parent were attributed to the homosexual or her associates: children were recorded as harmed and exposed to the harm of neglect in one of the 6 comparison cases. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] \n \n \n WHAT PROPORTION OF HETEROSEXUALS IS EX-HOMOSEXUAL. \n Authors: Cameron, Paul\n Cameron, Kirk \n Source: Psychological Reports; Dec2002 Part 2, Vol. 91 Issue 3, p1087, 11p, \n \n Abstract: How many heterosexuals are 'ex-homosexuals'? In 1984, a random sample of Dallas adults indicated that 8 (2.7%) of 294 currently heterosexual men and 4 (1.0%) of 393 currently heterosexual women said that they were ex-homosexual. Of an urban sample from 5 additional cities, 0.5% of current heterosexuals reported that they had been homosexually 'married'. It thus appears that perhaps 1-2% of heterosexuals are ex-homosexuals. Proportionately more adults than teenagers and more men than women moved from homosexuality to heterosexuality. Of the 18 who changed, 12 became heterosexual and 6 bisexual, suggesting that perhaps two-thirds of those who abandon \"being\" homosexual 'become' heterosexual and a third 'become' bisexual. Because labeling oneself 'homosexual' is so mutable and value-laden, the term 'omnisexual' is suggested. \n \n \n Does homosexual activity shorten life? \n Authors: Cameron, Paul\n Cameron, Kirk \n Source: Psychological Reports; Dec98 Part 1, Vol. 83 Issue 3, p847, 20p, 2 \n \n Abstract: Examines four different contemporary databases for evidence that homosexual activity might be associated with a shortened lifespan. Estimates on the median age of death for homosexuals is less then 50 years; Reduction of gay lifespan by AIDS by about ten percent; Obituaries; Sex surveys; Homosexual partnerships; HIV testing and AIDS in Colorado. \n ISSN: 0033-2941 \n Accession Number: 1478358 \n \n \n Title: HOMOSEXUAL PARENTS , By: Cameron, Paul, Cameron, Kirk, Adolescence, 00018449, Winter96, Vol. 31, Issue 124\n \n Does the homosexuality of parents affect the sexual orientation or experiences of their children? Seventeen of 5,182 randomly obtained adults from six U.S. cities answered questionnaires indicating that they had a homosexual parent. Parental homosexuality may be related to findings that: (1) 5 of the 17 reported sexual relations with their parents; (2) a disproportionate fraction reported sexual relations with other caretakers and relatives; and (3) a disproportionate fraction: (a) claimed a less than exclusively heterosexual orientation (47%); (b) indicated gender dissatisfaction; and (c) reported that their first sexual experience was homosexual. Of 1,388 consecutive obituaries in a major homosexual newspaper, 87 of the gays who died had children and registered a median age of death of 47 (the 1,267 without children had a median age of death of 38); 10 lesbians did and 24 did not have children. We estimate that less than 1% of parents are bisexual or homosexual and that < 7% of gays and about a third of lesbians are parents. \n \n \n Title: DO HOMOSEXUALS TEACHERS POSE A RISK TO PUPILS? , By: Cameron, Paul, Cameron, Kirk, Journal of Psychology, 00223980, Nov96, Vol. 130, Issue 6\n \n ABSTRACT. Questionnaires were completed by 5,182 adults derived from one-wave area cluster samples in 6 metropolitan areas: 56% of homosexuals and 18% of heterosexuals reported having had a homosexual teacher; 12% of the men and 4% of the women said that the teacher made sexual advances toward them. A fifth of those with a homosexual teacher said they were influenced to regard homosexuality as socially acceptable; 4% said that the teacher influenced them to try homosexuality. About 1% of the sample reported that, as pupils, they had sexual relations with at least one of their elementary or secondary teachers. Eight respondents reported their first sexual experience was with an elementary or secondary teacher and that one of these experiences was homosexual. Of 49 other reported sexual experiences with teachers, 12 were homosexual. The findings that homosexuals more frequently claimed to have had homosexual teachers and more frequently reported homosexual sex with teachers tend to fit the contagion model of homosexuality--that homosexuality is taught by or caught by sexual interaction with homosexual practitioners.",

   "You aren't allowed to outspokenly racist in the same way, even if you actually beleive that, no different here. \n \n Hmm as for the lifespan thing, I wonder how much of that is due to the older population not being as openly gay as those amoung the younger population as their peers are generally not as accepting. Think it would have an effect? Do they factor out AIDS as well, I doubt it.\n \n Children increased chance of being homosexual, so what. If you don't see a problem with it this is not really a big issue. They might be more likely to experiment but are m,ore likely to be allowed to choose want they want in the end than the other way round in straight couples.\n \n \nPresumably, the study of gay relationships did not include non-serious relationships (maybe I can look this up) so why should we include those with the heteros. And yes, I would love to see those studies because frankly I am skeptical. What would possilby lead gay couples to be more stable than heteros?\n Doesn't sound like it, looks like it basically compared all gay relationships to all long term straight ones. Seems like what a serious relationship for straights is different from gays in this study. Can't find the families one, will keep looking but has something to do with the extra effort that gay couples need to go to to get a child compared to straight couples. They have to be very certain they want it and get far more opertunities to decide they don't want to than a straight couple under noral conditions.",

   "I disagree with your definition of the purpose of a LEGAL marriage. \n \n IMHO, when it comes to the state's involvement, it's all about the MONEY.\n \n What does the state require of, and offer to, a couple that is married vs. unmarried? As near as I can tell, there's only one difference, and it's how you're taxed. The state doesn't really care whether you love each other, whether you have children, how old each partner is, what religion you ascribe to, etc, etc... \n \n The state only cares that both partners are freely entering into what for all intents and purposes is nothing more than legal contract. That contract entitles you to certain benefits and tax credits, as you are now viewed as \"one entity\" rather than two individuals. \n \n Call it a marriage, call it a legal union, call it cheese, it doesn't matter to matter to me, but I just can't wrap my head around denying another person STATE BENEFITS (their tax dollars) based on their sexual orientation.\n \n I agree with your definition of a marriage as it pertains to religious beliefs. Each faith should be free to define marriage as it so chooses. I don't think state recognized marriages are a threat to the religious sacrament of marriage in any way. It's apples and oranges IMHO.\n \n Waxy\n\n The function of law is to sanction behavior; law is one type of formal social control. The state uses privileges to reward desirable behavior and taxes to punish undesirable behavior (if it is rational anyway). It is a mistake to see the state as nothing more than some sort of amoral money collector and dispenser. Law is to a large extent the formalization, the codification of a society's values (at least the values of society's powerful groups). \n \n Granting marriage licenses to homosexuals rewards their relationship arrangement. As you write, there are economic benefits. But there are other kinds of rewards as well. For example, a married partner may be able to make medical decisions for a partner who is not capable of making his or her own choices. This is a legal privilege, not an economic one. Another benefit, which I am sure is important to some homosexuals, is symbolic, moral and social. Marriage communicates something to others. The state uses its authority to say this union is legitimate; it is equal in moral value to other marriages. Some homosexuals want marriage because an authoritative source--in this case the government--is affirming, certifying, their lifestyle. In my view, the proper role of government is to ignore homosexuality, not to use its power to enshrine a homosexual lifestyle.",

They argue such things as he wrongly interprreted others' studies or was called a sociologist when he wasn't; if every person were thrown out of the APA for misinterpreting research or for making misleading commments or for being called something they weren't, there wouldn't be anyone left in the organization. \n \n On other Davis pages, they critique his data collections as seriously flawed. Once again if people were thrown out of these orgs. everytime they did arguably shoddy work, I could count the number remaining on my fingers and toes. The only point at which these orgs. approach honesty is when they say that Cameron opposes civil rights for homosexuals. \n \n So finally we get to it; he was kicked out because he doesn't share their politics. If he were on the left instead of the right, these organizations would scream \"MCCARTHYISM!!!!!\" But since he is a conservative Christian, his right to free speech and academic freeedom can be flushed down to the toilet. This reveals the true colors of liberals; they believe in free speech when it advances their cause, and the fascist comes out when someone's speech works against them. I take my lessons from liberals, so I will applaud the American College of Pediatricians if they eject a member for being too pro-homosexual. \n \n As for the criticisms of his research methods, some are valid and some are quibbles. Many analysts never subject research to this standard of scrutiny if they like the results. I need to read through the studies to get a bet a better sense of their quality, but at this point they seem pretty run-of-the-mill in terms of methods. I certainly do not automatically dismiss his findings because he has an agenda; if that was my rule, I couldn't read 90% of social science research. \n \n One thing I noticed was that the critics offered not even one study, let alone better done stuff, to contradict Cameron. The proper response to Cameron is to conduct better research, not to ostracize and demonize him.\n \n As for Psychological Reports, one likely reason it has a low rejection rate is that it is a bimonthy (not quarterly) journal that publishes many, short studies, thus accomodating many people who submit papers. Anyway, it is a good enough journal to be at every university I have ever attended or taught at; the psych. dept. here has deemed it a good enough journal to keep on the shelf dating back to 1955.",

   "The 8-20 years less life statistic for gay men comes from a study of gay men, with HIV, done of a select urban area(Vancouver) in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The authors wrote \"Gay Life Expectancy Re-Visited\" in the Internatinal Journal of Epidemiology, in response to anti-gay groups misuing their study...\n \n\n Apparently, your post here is wrong. I read the abstract of this article, and the conclusions are the life expectancy of ALL gay men is 8 to 20 years less than heterosexual men--not just HIV positive men. The conclusion of the study:\n \n \"In a major Canadian centre, life expectancy at age 20 years for gay and bisexual men is 8 to 20 years less than for all men. If the same pattern of mortality were to continue, we estimate that nearly half of gay and bisexual men currently aged 20 years will not reach their 65th birthday. Under even the most liberal assumptions, gay and bisexual men in this urban centre are now experiencing a life expectancy similar to that experienced by all men in Canada in the year 1871.\"\n \n I don't know how you could construe this to mean they are speaking of the life expectancy of only gay men living with AIDS. And the fewer cases of AIDS in recent years that they speak is not significant in the case of the the U.S. According to Table 3 at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/stats/hasr1402/2002SurveillanceReport.pdf \n \n there were 17,357 new male-male contact cases of AIDS in 1998; it was 16,944 in 2002. So it took 5 years to come down 413 cases (17,357-16944=413). A drop of 413 new cases over 5 years averages to 82.6 fewer new cases each year. 82.6 is .5% of the 17,357 new cases observed in 1998. In other words, based on the last five years of available data, new cases have been dropping only .5% per year. This slowdown is too small to affect life expectancy much.",

For example, if my 5% is right and say the average HIV positive gay man lived only to 30, and all other gay men lived to 73--the life expectancy of all men--that implies a life expectancy of 70.9 years for homosexuals, only 2.1 years less. But the epidemiological study said life expectancy was 8-20 years lower. Puzzling to me.",

I thought you said that the study was done off AIDS deaths \nIf you mean that elderly gay men didn't get calculated in, thus not raising the life expectancy, well they based their calculations on the number of men dying from AIDS of any age, and based on other studies, assumed that 95% of male deaths from AIDS cases in that city were of gay men, so presumably old men denying they are not gay would not be an issue.\n so these other things arn't an issue, homosexuals with AIDS have a lower life expectancy as they are more likely to get it younger is what the study says, most likely due to the different sectors of the population it is most common. For the kind of drop we are seeing in an overal population I think the stats might be a little wrong, if the majority of homosexuals were dying in their 30-50s then it would be a much bigger thing and would have been noticed well before these types of studies were done. If 5% had such a low life expectancy in the population then a lot of people in the rest of the population would be noticably living longer than the 'normal' which would also be noted before now.",

   "The function of law is to sanction behavior; law is one type of formal social control. The state uses privileges to reward desirable behavior and taxes to punish undesirable behavior (if it is rational anyway). It is a mistake to see the state as nothing more than some sort of amoral money collector and dispenser. Law is to a large extent the formalization, the codification of a society's values (at least the values of society's powerful groups). \n \n Granting marriage licenses to homosexuals rewards their relationship arrangement. As you write, there are economic benefits. But there are other kinds of rewards as well. For example, a married partner may be able to make medical decisions for a partner who is not capable of making his or her own choices. This is a legal privilege, not an economic one. Another benefit, which I am sure is important to some homosexuals, is symbolic, moral and social. Marriage communicates something to others. The state uses its authority to say this union is legitimate; it is equal in moral value to other marriages. Some homosexuals want marriage because an authoritative source--in this case the government--is affirming, certifying, their lifestyle. In my view, the proper role of government is to ignore homosexuality, not to use its power to enshrine a homosexual lifestyle.\n\n \n I agree with you for the most part.\n \n It's very difficult, and I'd suggest somewhat naive, to attempt to legislate morality.\n \n It's my belief, and this may be my romantic version of reality, that the function of law, especially in a free and democratic society, is not to impose morality, but to prevent/punish immorality. A minor distinction, but in my mind, a very important one. \n \n In plain speaking, the gov't will not impose any kind of behavioural code upon you, you are free to do as you please, as long as it doesn't harm others or legitimately infringe on their rights. \n \n On that basis, I don't see homosexual marriage as an issue that is legislatable? by the state. \n \n Furthermore, I think every point you've made is actually BENEFICIAL to the state. If we can take an area of society that will always exist, and rather than marginalize it, recognize it for what it is and allow it to to become strong and self sufficient, IMHO, everyone wins. \n \n Is it better that the state is making critical care decisions?

IMHO, granting them the \"affirmation\" of marriage will lead to increased stability and positive contribution on their part, again, everyone wins.\n \n Throughout all of these debates, I've yet to have anyone demonstrate any CONCRETE efffects that gay marriage will have on society. Instead, all I hear is broad generalities on how gay marriage will destroy the sanctity of marriage. Frankly, I just don't see it. I don't see how my life will be cheapened or my upcoming heterosexual marriage would be any less valid.\n \n These threads seem to me to always come down to one thing, and it's not marriage/laws/rights, it's simply whether or not you accept/tolerate homosexuality, and whether or not you feel that homosexuals are deserving of equal value and status as heterosexuals and human beings. If people view homosexuals as being somehow less valuable or inferior to heteros, they tend to object to anything that may threaten their \"superior\" status.

I would prefer a partner to make these decisions. Actually, my main concerns with gay marriage are moral, and over concerns about children raised in these families, and secondarily about the potential for abuse and fraud. \n \n \n\n Is it better for the state to ostracize these people and make them illegitmate in society, or would it be better to grant them an equal footing and let them contribute as recognized members of society? IMHO, granting them the \"affirmation\" of marriage will lead to increased stability and positive contribution on their part, again, everyone wins.\n \n\n As I said, homosexuals and their children benefit from marriage over just living together. Everyone else, on the other hand loses, because one authoritative morality is futher discredited (it has been gutted for the last 40 years) and the gulf of nihilism we find ourselves in widens and deepens. \n \n \n \n Throughout all of these debates, I've yet to have anyone demonstrate any CONCRETE efffects that gay marriage will have on society. Instead, all I hear is broad generalities on how gay marriage will destroy the sanctity of marriage. Frankly, I just don't see it. I don't see how my life will be cheapened or my upcoming heterosexual marriage would be any less valid.\n \n\n I'm sorry but several millenia of marriage being heterosexual puts the onus on you, not us, to demonstrate why gay marriage is justified.\n \n I will quote what I wrote this in an earlier post: \"Your claim that only right wing religious fanatics would argue against legalizing gay marriage is belied by poll after poll shows that at least 60% of Americans are against homosexual marriage. And for many of the rest, it is just an attitude of tolerance, not that they positively value homosexual marriage. It is just this attitude of \"whatever people want to do\" or \"anything goes\" that is a major problem in our culture right now. That is just plain nihilism: there are no authoritative values, no right and wrong. If you want to move in with a goat, who am I to question it?\" \n \n \"Personally, I have nothing against homosexuality, but it is high time we said enough nihilism! For the last 40 years, we have been unable to tell anyone \"NO!\" If we destroy all the traditional restraints, there will be nothing in the way of every imaginable impulse from having free reign. Freud said \"Civilization is only made possible by individual renouncement.\" He knew that unchecked animal passions will eventually lead to the destruction of civilization. On our present course, we will one day see the ruins of a once great society. But at least we'll be able to say, \"Well at least we didn't judge anybody!\" \n \n \"Any healthy society requires an authoritative moral structure to lead people to prosocial behavior. The bedrock of that structure in the U.S. has been the Bible, and when you discredit it, people find themselves in a moral vacuum where there are only personal tastes and preferences, and Freud was right that people run only by their ids end up in producing chaos. As I said before, gay marriage itself is not that big of a deal to me, and I might go along with the cultural nihilists if they would promise me this was the very LAST time they would destroy another traditional value. But I know them too well; their logic will never let them stop.\"\n \n \n \n These threads seem to me to always come down to one thing, and it's not marriage/laws/rights, it's simply whether or not you accept/tolerate homosexuality, and whether or not you feel that homosexuals are deserving of equal value and status as heterosexuals and human beings.

IMHO, it really is that simple, and if I may be so bold, I think a lot of people on both sides of the issue agree me, whether they realize it or not.\n \n \n Homosexual sex is not of equal moral value to heterosexual sex. Homosexual attraction is an eccentricity, and we don't enshrine eccentricities. That is not to say homosexuals have less intrinsic value; it is easy to separate one behavior from the person. You are right to imply that being in favor of gay marriage is to say that homosexual sex is morally equal to heterosexual sex; this is not just an issue of homosexuals being withheld something that there is no reason not to give them. This IS a moral issue, and we disgree on the moriality of it. To me a heterosexual arrangement is the desired, preferable one for adults. For you, one is not preferable to the other. It appears that your views on specific issues are drawn from the principle of \"no harm done to others.\" \n \n On the issue of harm, one thing that seems apparent to me from earlier discussions of the facts of relationship stability, heterosexuals average long-term relationships of more than 20 years, while the average homosexual couple is together 2 to 3 years (I am not certain how reliable this number is.) If those numbers are right, children raised in homosexual homes are much more likely to be harmed by the break up of their parents than other children. This problem is serious among kids raised in heterosexual homes, implying the problem is much worse in homosexual homes. \n \n Marriage might help some homosexual families be more stable, but the nihilistic tendencies of our culture I have been writing have rendered the binding power of marriage very weak nowadays. On the other hand, legalizing gay marriage may encourage some homosexuals to have kids they wouldn't otherwise have since they think kids should be born to married parents, thus bringing children into families that have much higher rates of instability than in hetero families.",

And this was in very conservative rural Idaho 20 years ago, so I'm skeptical of the view that hatred of homosexual sex is so intense, that every homosexual is going to be chased to the top of the windmill by a bunch of villagers with pitchforks at the slightest provocation. \n \n I looked up how many homosexuals were killed in 2002 in a hate crime. You'd think from the coverage like that of the Matthew Shephard incident that the number is in the thousands. It's 12. Of course those 12 crimes are awful, but thousands of heteros are killed every year, so let's get a little perspective.",

   "I agree with you for the most part.\n \n It's very difficult, and I'd suggest somewhat naive, to attempt to legislate morality.\n \n It's my belief, and this may be my romantic version of reality, that the function of law, especially in a free and democratic society, is not to impose morality, but to prevent/punish immorality. A minor distinction, but in my mind, a very important one. \n \n In plain speaking, the gov't will not impose any kind of behavioural code upon you, you are free to do as you please, as long as it doesn't harm others or legitimately infringe on their rights. \n\n \n But the US government legislates morality all of the time. No sex with minors; no underage drinking; no smoking under 18; no obscenities in public; no pornography....the list is endless. \n \n\n On that basis, I don't see homosexual marriage as an issue that is legislatable? by the state. \n\n The state has a vested interest in preserving marriage as an institution. That's why it grants special rights to married partners. Granting the same rights to gays does have a negative impact on society. It diminishes the institution of marriage. It creates more of a financial burden on companies that have to pay for the partner's health benefits. It puts more strain on the Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare systems. It creates a new class of \"victims\" for the courts to deal with in divorce proceedings, custody disputes, etc., \n \n\n Furthermore, I think every point you've made is actually BENEFICIAL to the state. If we can take an area of society that will always exist, and rather than marginalize it, recognize it for what it is and allow it to to become strong and self sufficient, IMHO, everyone wins.\n\n Drug abusers have always existed too. Should we also allow them to \"become strong and self-sufficient\"? How about prostitution? If you answer anything but \"yes\", then you are applying your logic selectively. \n \n\n Is it better that the state is making critical care decisions? Or should your closest friend and life partner be making that decision? Do you want a nanny gov't, or would you rather people took care of themselves?\n\n I think that you know my answer to that question already, But, as long as we have a whole plethora of nanny programs, I'm against creating any new members.\n \n\n Is it better for the state to ostracize these people and make them illegitmate in society, or would it be better to grant them an equal footing and let them contribute as recognized members of society? IMHO, granting them the \"affirmation\" of marriage will lead to increased stability and positive contribution on their part, again, everyone wins.\n\n I disagree for the reasons stated above.\n \n\n Throughout all of these debates, I've yet to have anyone demonstrate any CONCRETE efffects that gay marriage will have on society. Instead, all I hear is broad generalities on how gay marriage will destroy the sanctity of marriage. Frankly, I just don't see it. I don't see how my life will be cheapened or my upcoming heterosexual marriage would be any less valid.\n\n I've listed several concrete examples above.\n \n\n These threads seem to me to always come down to one thing, and it's not marriage/laws/rights, it's simply whether or not you accept/tolerate homosexuality, and whether or not you feel that homosexuals are deserving of equal value and status as heterosexuals and human beings. If people view homosexuals as being somehow less valuable or inferior to heteros, they tend to object to anything that may threaten their \"superior\" status. IMHO, it really is that simple, and if I may be so bold, I think a lot of people on both sides of the issue agree me, whether they realize it or not.\n \n\n I could care less if someone is gay or not right up until they want to start taking money out of my pocket to put in their own. I hear gays saying all of the time that it isn't an economic issue. Fine. Deny them the ability to collect their partners SS, medical benefits, inheritance (without a will), etc., and see how they'd react to that proposal. I'll guarantee you that they'd respond in the negative. It IS about money; yours and mine.",

Once gay marriage was the law of the land, I can easily see the next set of arguments being that gay families are new and fragile and are often victims of discrimination, so the government needs to initiate new programs to strengthen those families and to re-educate heteros on the rightness of these families. Gay families will further bolster the argument that increasingly homosexuals are family providers, yet face discrimination at the workplace, so we need affirmative action and set-aside programs for them, and on and on.",

   "Laws reward as well as punish. whether that was the intention of the lawmakers or not. Legalizing gay marriage doesn't punish anything; it rewards homosexuality, or putting it in other words, it says homosexuality is on the same moral plane as heterosexual marriage.\n\n \n You say reward, I say give long overdue equality.\n \n I have no problem with the moral implications of \"elevating\" gay marriage to the same plane as far as the state is concerned. It just goes to basic human equality under the eyes of the law. \n \n \nThis position expresses a value, the value that anything whatsoever should be permitted as long as no one else is harmed. You cannot claim that this position makes you not a morality legislator. By the way, I think this value is a harmful one. It is nihilistic and licentious. As a couple examples, a group of cultists who kill themselves are engaging in moral behavior by your standard, or teenagers who cut on themselves are behaving morally by your definition. Drug addiction is moral behavior. This is a bankrupt morality that says that all behavior that doesn't harm others is good.\n \n If you argue that these behaviors are not good, that your morality only labels certain behaviors as bad (i.e., those that hurt others), then your morality is nihilistic: there is no good behavior.\n\n \n I see your point galton, and I do agree that all things have limits.\n \n The cultists - we as a society have deemed suicide as immoral. Nihilistic as it may be, I believe that if someone IS OF SOUND MIND and wants to kill themselves, that should be their right. As for the teen cutting himself, it's likely a sign of depression and easily treatable. \n \n Unfortunately, nothing is black and white. What mental issues or mind control has affected these people that they want to kill/injure themselves? Should they be forced to undergo psychological treatment? IMHO, every effort should be made to help these people, but ultimately, the choice of what to do with their lives is THEIRS, not yours and mine.\n \n Drug addiction harms far more people than the addict themselves.\n \n There is good behaviour, that seems obvious to me. Anything you do that BENEFITS others, and yourself, is good behaviour.\n \n I'm not sure why valuing individual freedom is considered bankrupt morality. Perhaps this should be discussion should becontinued in a new thread though, it's pretty off topic.\n \n Waxy",

   "I agree that marriage would be good for homsexuals, and I agree that homosexuality will always be a part of society. I oppose gay marriage because legitimizing homosexuality attacks and works to discredit tradition and Christianity and Judaism, the only authoritaitve sources of morality in America. If the time arrives where homosexuality can be squared with tradition and Christianity and Judaism. As long as the advance of homosexuality results in a retreat in morality, I oppose it. \n\n \n This statement is somewhat contradictory to my mind. You say that you feel the right to marry would be beneficial to homosexuals, and at the same time you consider their advancement and benefit to against Christian morality.\n \n I sure don't understand Christian morality emoticon_confused , but that's another thread.\n \n \nOk, so we do agree then that gay marriage is more than an issue of money. I would prefer a partner to make these decisions. Actually, my main concerns with gay marriage are moral, and over concerns about children raised in these families, and secondarily about the potential for abuse and fraud. \n \n \n It's about legal and financial rights as designated by the state for married couples, not morality IMHO, but I do see why that becomes the focal point.\n \n \nAs I said, homosexuals and their children benefit from marriage over just living together. Everyone else, on the other hand loses, because one authoritative morality is futher discredited (it has been gutted for the last 40 years) and the gulf of nihilism we find ourselves in widens and deepens. \n \n \n I can't see it, I really can't, but that doesn't mean it isn't real or perceived I guess.\n \n \nI'm sorry but several millenia of marriage being heterosexual puts the onus on you, not us, to demonstrate why gay marriage is justified.\n\n \n I've seen the reasons why it's justified demonstrated repeatedly here. IMHO, as I've said and posted, it's just basic human equality and rights. It's the lack of a rebuttal for this assertion that I was pointing out. \n \n As much as pure nihilism scares you, pure Chrisitian or gov't mandated \"majority\" morality scares me.\n \n \nHomosexual sex is not of equal moral value to heterosexual sex. Homosexual attraction is an eccentricity, and we don't enshrine eccentricities. That is not to say homosexuals have less intrinsic value; it is easy to separate one behavior from the person. You are right to imply that being in favor of gay marriage is to say that homosexual sex is morally equal to heterosexual sex; this is not just an issue of homosexuals being withheld something that there is no reason not to give them. This IS a moral issue, and we disgree on the moriality of it. To me a heterosexual arrangement is the desired, preferable one for adults. For you, one is not preferable to the other. It appears that your views on specific issues are drawn from the principle of \"no harm done to others.\" \n \n \n I disagree, again, this isn't about morality IMHO, it's about equality under the law, but for those who oppose homosexual marriage, morality is the only issue that can really be argued.\n \n There are a multitude of things that I prefer in our society, heterosexual marriages is one of them. Does that mean that my preferences should overrule those of everyone else? We tolerate things - everything from social issues and morality to people driving a different brand of vehicle than we prefer - on a daily basis. Should we stop tolerating that and attempt to legislate intolerance based on the majority? That seems to be your position. I'm right, you're wrong, and if we do it your way, the world will end due to moral bankruptcy.\n \n \nOn the issue of harm, one thing that seems apparent to me from earlier discussions of the facts of relationship stability, heterosexuals average long-term relationships of more than 20 years, while the average homosexual couple is together 2 to 3 years (I am not certain how reliable this number is.) If those numbers are right, children raised in homosexual homes are much more likely to be harmed by the break up of their parents than other children. This problem is serious among kids raised in heterosexual homes, implying the problem is much worse in homosexual homes. \n \n Marriage might help some homosexual families be more stable, but the nihilistic tendencies of our culture I have been writing have rendered the binding power of marriage very weak nowadays. On the other hand, legalizing gay marriage may encourage some homosexuals to have kids they wouldn't otherwise have since they think kids should be born to married parents, thus bringing children into families that have much higher rates of instability than in hetero families.\n\n \n These numbers are so skewed and whimsical IMHO. How can you compare relationships in a state affirmed, enshrined bond openly accepted by society, to those of people who live on societies edges and are openly persecuted?\n \n If the only option available to you was long term dating, where is the incentive for commitment?\n \n If you are living your life \"in the closet\" or on the \"down low\" what support is there for any type of a long term commitment?\n \n I think children are a big factor, 20 years is just about right for Mom and Dad to tough it out till the kids are out of the house and then go their separate ways. Of the divorces I know of personally, 4 of 5 were this scenario.\n \n What positive influence would legalized marriage have on homosexual couples? I think it would be big factor, having legal and open marriages to defend and have supported.\n \n This stuff is such pointless speculation IMHO. For every negative that can be associated, the numbers can just as easily be spun to demonstrate the positive effect that marriage can and would have for couples.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. How is the eroding \"power of the bond\" of marriage among heterosexuals relevent? I don't see that as being a factor.",

I wrote in an earlier post: \n \n \"In last 40 years, while people like some in this thread have trashed Chistianity and the traditional moral foundation of American society, a tidal wave of social problems the likes of we've never seen before has swept over the country. Crime is several times what it was pre-1960. In the 60s there were a few thousand gang members in the country who were about as nasty as the dancing guys in \"West Side Story\"; now there are 1 million Tech 9-toting gangbangers, dealing drugs to kids and killing them in drive-bys. Addictions are of control: drugs--legal and illegal--gambling, sex, pornography, you name it. The porn industry was underground in the 60s and now it's a multi-billion dollar industry (I've read it's bigger than Hollywood). We supply the world with porn these days. STDs were at low levels; AIDS was non-existent. Now 20% of people have genital herpes (45% of black Americans) and hundreds of thousands are HIV positive. The percent of kids under 15 are having sex several times higher than in the past. More than 1 million abortions are performed every year, half of them on fetuses more than 2 months old. Divorce and out-of-wedlock births exploded in the 60s where now 1/2 of kids grow up with little involvement from dad; 70% of blacks kids are born to an unwed mom. Infidelity is way up, both among married and unmarried. I could go on and on, but the list of social ills is getting tedious.\" \n \n There clearly has been a severe decline in traditional moral authority, as its critics have been arguing things like, \"People can do whatever they want, and we should respect that. Only God can judge. The Bible is irrelevant and false.\" We folks on this forum like to flatter ourselves that we are too smart for old-time morality, but what the guy on the street takes all this to mean is that there is no authoritative right and wrong, and I can do whatever I feel like. His only fear has become whether the cops catch him or not. As a less extreme example, the man who has isn't ready for kids or who grown tired of playing the father role has nothing holding him back as he walks away. He tells himself that while the old rules would have forbidden such a thing, nowadays the old morality doesn't apply; we just need to find our own happiness in life. \n \n I can imagine that your response this arguement is that correlation does not necessarily mean causation, but if X runs in tandem with Y, it is becuase X causes Y, or Y causes X, or Z causes both X and Y. I doubt an explosion of social problems causes a decline in traditional morality, and I'm not sure what would cause both.",

This is a complex issue because it requires us to look at many factors. Two factors that now seem clear to me (others are not) are that homosexuals have lifesltyles that reduce their lives an average of 14 years--that sounds pretty bad to me--and that serious heterosexual relationships may last up to ten times longer than for homosexuals--also a very important fact. \n \n As I have explained, my opposition to gay marriage is concern over the discrediting of traditional moral authority and the consequences for society, but this issue of harm or lack of harm to children raised by homosexuals is important in its own right, and I for one am in the process of trying to get a handle on that reality.\n \n So far I haven't seen any hard evidence that homosexuals offer, on average, any advantages...other than maybe better fashion sense.

   "It was stupid, by the looks of things they included all gay relationships but only serious long term heterosexual ones (I think they even defined serious ones by a minimum period, but only for straight relationships), seems like a loaded survey to me. As for the life expectancy ones a lot of the behaviors are hardly limited to homosexuality and their inclusion makes me wonder about the validity of that survey too as well as the huge gap. When someone then explained how it was done it made no sense and didn't proove what it said it did (just showed gays get AIDS younger than straights on average), but they may have misinterpretted it.\n Seems a lot of surveys also have trouble geting the full range of homosexuals and instead focus on where they are easy to find (i.e gay bars), while taking a general overview of the straight population. Those harmful behaviors seemed to look like the things generally associated with a younger population whch made me wonder if the same results was done reversed how things would change\n\n Some of your points are worth considering and looking in to, but all those health risks are listed by medical practioners when sensitizing professionals to the special health needs of gay men. I doubt with this that there is the kind of sample bias you are describing. And that epidemiological study showing 8-20 fewer years looks like it is very well done.

   "I'm interested in this question of the typical homosexual lifestyle, so I started an analysis of General Social Survey data--a nationally representative sample of Americans conducted every year by the U. of Chicago:\n \n http://webapp.icpsr.umich.edu/GSS/\n \n I looked to see if gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals differed on aspects of lifestyle I ran across. Contrary to earlier posts, I found that homosexual men are less likely to smoke. Lesbians and bisexual men were the groups who smoked the most.\n \n I looked to see what percent of people hang out in bars almost every night. Bisexuals were the most likely; gay and hetero men were in the middle; lesbians and hetero women were least likely to. \n \n I looked to see what percent of people were: romantically involved; lived together; and were happy in their relationship. Both hetero groups and the bisexual men and especially lesbians were the most likely to be involved, and gay men and bisexual women were the least likely. A high percentage of gay men and lesbians lived with their romantic partner; the bisexual groups were least likely, with heteros in the middle. All groups were very likely to be happy in their relationships.\n \n So these numbers don't show instability or unhealthy lifestyles among gay men and lesbians. It does look like about half of lesbians smoke, but the number of respondents was small, so this estimate may be crude. The bisexual tended to show more instability; this was probably due to the fact that the bi's tended to be younger. \n \n The only potentially negative aspect of these findings is that most gay men and lesbians who say they are romantically involved also say they are living with their partner, so this apparently makes a question about being romantically involved comparable to asking that of heteros, and thus provides evidence that the conclusion that hetero relationships tend to last longer than homosexual ones is based on comparable groups. Actually, according to this survey, you capture a higher percentage of casual relationships among the heteros when you ask, \"Are you involved?\"",

   "You say reward, I say give long overdue equality....It just goes to basic human equality under the eyes of the law. \n Waxy\n\n This seems to be a particularly important basis for your view. These statements lack precision. You are not advocating equality in the eyes of the law because (I am guessing) that you are not in favor of, for example, pedophile-victim marriages; you are in favor of equality before the law for marital arrangements that don't harm anyone. If this is your position, then ANY marital arrangment that doesn't harm anyone should be granted. That would include but not be limited to following types of marriages: adult daughter/father, adult son/mother, adult daughter/mother, adult son/father, adult brother/daughter, adult brother/brother, adult sister/sister, adult niece/uncle, adult nephew/aunt, adult niece/aunt, adult nephew/uncle, adult granddaughter/grandfather, adult grandson/grandmother, adult grandson/grandfather, adult granddaughter/grandmother, homosexual and heterosexual first-cousin pairings, groups marriages of family members of all possible combinations as long as their adults. \n \n By your standards, ANY conceivable group qualifies for marriage as long as no one gets hurt. Polygyny and polyandry fit this category, and there are tens of thousands of polygynists in the country and more immigrating every year. A free love commune desiring group marriage is another. There are hundreds of thousands of bisexuals in the country; maybe many would like to have one of each sex for a spouse. Many people might decide that a marriage of a group of friends would give the variety, economic stability, and social/emotional support not always found between two people. \n \n And I'm not even being skeptical about whether there is harm in marriages involving children. Girls in many parts of the world are marriage in their early teens, presumably not doing harm to participants. If I am reading you right, the burden of proof that the marital arrangements are harmful falls on the opponents of these marriages. How can we deny a couple who are originally from Mexico who want to get married even though the girl is only 13? How can deny 2 severely retarded people from getting married, or 2 institutionalized paranoid schizophrenics? A complete list of arguably non-harming marital arrangements (as homosexual marriages are arguably non-harming) would be very long indeed. \n \n As long as even one of these groups is not granted marriage licenses, we have not reached equality under the law as you define it.",

   "It's 2004 and the world has a favorite people to hate: homosexuals. That's right! People have moved away from using religion against blacks,(I'm black and mix), women, and Jews. The favorite target is gays. Why? Because some people are not tolerant and they are uncomfortable being around people who are different. Next, they have created an argument to justify oppressing homosexuals. Homosexuals are unnatural (The American Psychiatrists Association disagree), they are against God's will (Man made myth), gays are sexual perverts, they can't create(All heterosexuals don't marry nor have kids) God made Adam and Eve( I thought there were others after Adam and Eve),,,etc. Guess What! If homosexuals did not exist, these bigots would pick on another minority group. They quote little bits of biblical verses to deny homosexuals their rights, but these bigots don't have a full understanding of why these words were used and how they cannot be used in 2004 because, the words were of different meanings and were not against honest gays and lesbians (only homosexuals who were in pagan practices). For example, someone did not finish reading a newspaper article, but they are willing to tell everyone the story. These bigots don't understand why Paul (bible apostle) uses certain words. They say that the bible is against homosexuals, when in fact, bigots have improperly used the bible to justify hate. They have a lot in common with southern bigots during the civil rights movement. They used the biblical ham story(a 100% percent myth) to deny \"blacks\" their rights. They have cited Paul biblical verses to deny women the rights of equality with men(Paul teachings were for a specific period). The bottom line: We are dealing with cultural prejudice, not biblical prejudice. Humans have created dislike and hate for others who are different. This is bigger than a dislike for homosexuals, women, Jews, \"whites,\" \"blacks,\" etc;;; Hate is about disliking someone because of their ethnicity or perhaps the height of an individual. HOMOSEXUALS MAY HAVE A HARD TIME CHANGING PEOPLE VIEWS, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW JUST LIKE ANY OTHER GROUP. CHRISTIANS, JEWS, MUSLIMS, AND HINDUS MAY NOT DISAGREE IN THEIR RELIGIOUS VIEWS, BUT THEY ARE ALLOWED THEIR RIGHT TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGIONS(OPPS! BIGOTS ARE ALSO UNTOLERANT OF OTHER RELIGIONS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THEIRS).\n \n MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE BIBLE IS NOT AGAINST HOMOSEXUALS AND THAT'S A FACT. THERE ARE SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS IN THE BIBLE SUCH AS RUTH AND NAOMI, KING DAVID AND JONATHAN, GAY EUNICHS,,,ETC(GO RESEARCH THIS INFORMATION AND DON'T BECOME BRAINWASH BY WHAT OTHERS MAY HAVE TO SAY WITHOUT DOING YOU OWN RESEARCH).\n \n ATTENTION EVERYONE: I WILL USE A QUOTE FROM BAYARD RUSTIN, LATE GREAT \"BLACK\" GAY HUMAN RIGHTS LEADER AND LATE MENTOR OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. PLEASE READ THIS:\n 1986 SPEECH\n \"THERE ARE FOUR BURDENS, WHICH GAYS, ALONG WITH EVERY OTHER DESPISED GROUP, WHETHER IT IS BLACKS FOLLOWING SLAVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION, OR JEWS FEARFUL OF GERMANY, MUST ADDRESS. THE FIRST IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT ONE MUST OVERCOME FEAR. THE SECOND IS OVERCOMING SELF-HATE. THE THIRD IS OVERCOMING SELF-DENIAL. THE FOURTH BURDEN IS MORE POLITICAL. IT IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE JOB OF THE GAY COMMUNITY IS NOT TO DEAL WITH EXTREMISTS WHO WOULD CASTRATE US OR PUT US ON AN ISLAND AND DROP AN H-BOMB ON US. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THERE IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF THE HOMOSEXUAL COMMUNITY. THERE IS ANOTHER SMALL PERCENTAGE WHO WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND US. OUR JOB IS NOT TO GET THOSE PEOPLE WHO DISLIKE US TO LOVE US. NOR WAS OUR AIM IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT TO GET PREJUDICE WHITE PEOPLE TO LOVE US. OUR AIM WAS TO TRY TO CREATE THE KIND OF AMERICA, LEGISLATIVELY, MORALLY, AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY, SUCH THAT EVEN THOUGH SOME WHITES CONTINUED TO HATE US, THEY COULD NOT OPENLY MANIFEST THAT HATE, THAT'S OUR JOB TODAY: TO CONTROL THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE CAN PUBLICLY MANIFEST ANTIGAY SENTIMENT.\" He passed away in 1987 at the age of 75 years old.\n \n \n Brothers and Sisters, I could care less what \"race\" you are, ethnic sex, or religious background. We have to come together to speak out against people who are against allowing others their rights. Gays in the world, oppressed women under the taliban, or ethnic hate in Africa,Europe, and the rest of the worl emoticon_love d. Please do not be afraid to speak out.",

I can sign a civil contract to give anybody access to my property, but NOT others' property.\n\n \n I don't think I missed the point at all. Not only were you objecting to marriage, but it seemed pretty clear to me from this statement - \n \n \nThe state has a vested interest in preserving marriage as an institution. That's why it grants special rights to married partners. Granting the same rights to gays does have a negative impact on society. It diminishes the institution of marriage. It creates more of a financial burden on companies that have to pay for the partner's health benefits. It puts more strain on the Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare systems. It creates a new class of \"victims\" for the courts to deal with in divorce proceedings, custody disputes, etc., \n ................\n I could care less if someone is gay or not right up until they want to start taking money out of my pocket to put in their own. I hear gays saying all of the time that it isn't an economic issue. Fine. Deny them the ability to collect their partners SS, medical benefits, inheritance (without a will), etc., and see how they'd react to that proposal. I'll guarantee you that they'd respond in the negative. It IS about money; yours and mine.\n\n \n that you objected to any form, civil union included, of state recognition that would provide equal legal and financial rights to homosexual couples. Was that an incorrect interpretation of your point?\n \n I like the idea of a civil union, that's been my axe since the beginning. Give them a \"civil union\" that entitles them to state benefits and equality without redefining marriage. It would simply be defined as the union of either two men or two women. Problem solved. It's so simple and logical, it'll never work.\n \n \nI don't get it. Do you object to health care, retirement plans, benefits etc for hetero couples?

Geez!\n\n \n I could have been clearer, but perhaps you need to read a little more carefully as well.\n \n I don't view married heterosexual couples as a \"dependent class\", far from it. (Other than the fact that every citizen has become too dependent on the gov't for my liking.)\n \n I think that while there are gov't programs in place to provide direct financial assistance to married couples, the biggest thing they provide is a means for couples to help themselves. Tax incentives, retirement plans, legal and estate issues, etc... are all in place to aid them. It allows them to help themselves and get them off the gov't dole, or at least, minimize their impact.\n \n Who is paying for these services for homosexuals, or homosexual couples? It would seem to me that the gov't is picking up a much bigger piece of the pie, both directly and indirectly, due to the fact that the same aid in dealing with these important and COSTLY issues is not available to them.\n \n Is that schizophrenic?\n \n \nWaxy wrote:\n This type of response is baseless IMHO, it's pure and utter descrimination based on sex.

Do you see why I describe a \"It's all good as long as no blatant harm is done\" moral standard is licentious, nihililistic, and empty--it gives you no armor to resist a potential world of brothers and sisters marrying each other. One reason why we don't see an outcry for incestuous marriage is that the traditional morality remains strong and unchallenged in this area, but there is not reason this won't come under assault by some people from the \"anything goes\" camp? Incest is just a irrational superstition like all moral traditions, right? Those scary, meddling Christians are up to it again, telling siblings what they can and can't do. They are a terrifying bunch; they get taught destrictive things like that since you are a child of God, God commands them that they must treat you with dignity whether they feel like it or not, unlike the harmless nihilist who is free to see you as just a pile of biomass in his way from getting what he wants.\n\n \n If two mentally handicapped people or two people with mental health problems can find happiness and want to be married, why would anyone want to deny them that? \n \n Why jump to the \"poor persecuted Christian\" thing? \n \n Why classify anyone in favour of gay marriage as a nihilist who only regards humans as biomass?

Since it is a man's right to marry another man, would it also be his right to marry a mule?

It could be called gay marriage or civil unions as long as they have the same equal rights as a married heterosexual couple. Gays have families and their children also need to be protected. I believe gays are allowed to marry in Sweden and Holland. There are no problems whatsoever. The problem: Don't think sex all the time when you think of homosexual relationships. You have gay couples who are senior citizens. 2 men being in a relationship is foreign to you, but it's not for others. If Mike and Shawn are happy with one another, you should be ok with it. Hey, at least you don't have to worry about a gay person trying to talk to your wife or girlfriend. Please Remember: Don't think sex when dealing with same sex relationships.

So you like gays, but just don't think they should be treated equally and be allowed to choose the lifestyle you want- some friend you are. You oppose gay rights and consider it a mental disorder, that fits quite well into the common defintion of homophobic. If you beleive what you do you have no problem being homophobic as there is a definite reason for it, howwever don't try to pretend you are a friend in anyway to them.\n\n I like people not homosexuality. Everyone has equal rights this is already done until you can show how they don't. Also why do I care about the UK?

   " Okay, you've only proved that homosexuality is maladaptive in males just now, and only then if they mate. Also, there is a lot of harmful behavior that is worse than that that is not considered a disorder, like playing football. You can be injured doing that, but as it doesn't fit under the other two catagories, it is not considered a disorder. Homosexual intercourse is justifiable, it would be unjustifiable to expect two people in love to never have a physical relationship.\n\n No I've referred to both genders. If they dobn't act on it then are they gay? Am I a professional football player becasue I think about hjow great it would be or do I ahve to actually do before I'm considered a pro football player? Football has many benefits that outweight the risks. Homosexuality does not. Also how is it justifiable? Yes the law prohibits many people taht are in love to never act on their feelings, such as if school/teacher, adult/minor, two married, relatives, and many others.\n \n \n \n\n Yes, but you can not prove that they are no longer homosexual, just that they no longer act on what they desire.\n\n Define a homosexual? If someone tries weed once and tehy always wnt it again but never do it are tehy addicted?\n \n \n \n\n Yes, but a loving parent does not make rules for no reason. There has to be some way that it is harmful to someone for it to be unacceptable. Also, they wouldn't make a rule against some slightly harmful behavior without making rules against more harmful behavior, like spending all your time watching sports or playing football, which can cause injuries. Or going to a Catholic Church, did you know that all that kneel sit stand stuff can cause damage to your kneecaps?\n\n I've given you many reasons on why ti shouldn't be done. It is harmful to them and society. Tehy do make rules to more harmful behavior but spending your time watching or palying sports has many beneficial aspects as opposed to other behavior.\n \n \n \n\n Polygamy is between more than two consenting adults, because everyone in the marriage is married to more than one person. Relatives may end up getting married, but they are just as likely to if gays can or can not get married. After all, if two relatives fall in love they can fight for it just as well with or without gay marriage. Personally, I don't think gay marriage has any effect on it, because if it gets enough support we will end up with it, gay marriage being legal or not. \n\n Polygamy is between two people. It jsut happens that one makes various contracts. The contracts are independent of each other so it only invovles two. It's liek if you're a buyer or seller. One contract with one buyer/seller is independent other buyers and sellers.\n How do you determine that gay nmarriage deserves recognition adn other marriages do not?",

   " Thank you so much for these misrepresented statistics from the board of directors of this not so prestigious, 2 year old, right-wing political organization. What was I thinking posting from the American Academy of Pediatrics?\n \n I just love the part where they state that homosexual partnerships are more prone to breaking up, compared to heterosexual marriage. Do all heterosexuals marry the first person they have a partnership with?\n \n Oh, and what a surprise, heterosexual marriages last longer than the average gay relationship! Just like in my previous example, this is an apples and oranges comparison. Not all heterosexuals who are in relationships are married. \n \n They also cited the Bell and Weinberg study from the 1970's. Gay men in sex clubs and gay singles bars and gay book stores were interviewed, and found to be promiscuous. The heterosexuals surveyed were from residential areas, some included married couples. In order for the samples to be comparable they would have to survey heterosexuals from hetero singles bars, hetero sex clubs, and hetero book stores. For all we know their findings could have indicated what life was like for the average single person in San Fran in the 1970's. \n \n Also, some other studies were misrepresented.\n \n For example, the claims of more domestic violence in gay relationships cites the Island and Letellier study. It's authors have shown how they were quoted completely out of context by right-wing anti-gay groups...\n \n http://www.afaexposed.com/a_letellier.html\n \n Also the authors of the original study on gay life expectancy have had their study misrepresented by anti-gay groups, as the authors show in this article in the International Journal of Epidemiology...\n \n http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1499\n\n \n Jake so what I can go to other websites that have an agenda like you websites do and pull up articles to refute and then we'll eb going back and forth. My argument if that there is nothing defintive and each side is going to believe in their studies. Also since neither side can show that it is definitively better or genetic then it should be assumed that it isn't because until their is defintive evidence to suggest otherwise original decision should stand.\n \n \n \n \n Obsessed with the idea that he is going to hell if he doesn't follow all the rules, wanting to die because he sees it as the only \"cure\"? Attacks anyone who questions his beliefs. That indicates a problem with religion. \n\n Why do you keep using the word obsessed? People can be concerned and not obsessed. If i had a problem that i thought was so bad I would wnat to die regardless what the reason was even if it was religious. If I had a terminal illnesses I would rather die quickly than be a burden and suffer the idignities of the disease. Does that make my culture or the medical communtiy wrong for giving me that perspective?( I do not believe in euthanasia)\n \n \n \n He has a wide diversity of opinions presented to him. I did not attack religion as I wrote previously. I told him he had to consider that he was using religion in a destructive way.\n\n I can't understand how you cna provide with a variety of non-religous views without condemning his religous views.\n \n \n \n Yes, it really is. It shows the dark side of the ex-gay \"program\". You are the last person he needs to talk to. What would you tell him, to keep going on the path he's going on? To keep trying something that has not worked. Stay miserable so that you want to die, because God wants you in that situation, or God can magically make you feel better or heterosexual if you simply have a little more faith and pray just a little more? What would you tell this person? How would you defend the ex-gay \"program\"? I'm thinking maybe nothing could make things worse for him, but I still hesitate to give you his email. \n\n Ex-gay programs are like any intervention program. Many poeple that fail rehab or anyt other rehab programs feel depressed and upset becasue tehy feel there is no cure.\n \n I would simply ask him what he is feelinig. I feel that indirect communication loses alot in the translation. I feel that you're presenting a very bias opinion of his probloems and that doesn't allow me to see what he's feeling.",

The tax benefits that you \"are entitled to\" aren't based on your sexual orientation, they're based on your marital status. You get NO benefits from being a heterosexual nor do you lose any by being a homosexual. What you gain through marriage are benefits that the government has deemed worthy of reinforcing/rewarding financially. It is no different from giving home owners a tax break on their mortgage interest because the government promotes property ownership of its citizens. And these benefits were given to the individuals through legislation written by Congress and signed into law by the President. Gays don't want to go that route because it would be the kiss of death to their cause. Instead, they search out sympathetic minor governmental officials and judges who attempt to institute fiat laws that attempt to force policy AND COSTS on the citizens without their input. \n If gay marriages are allowed without Congressional involvement, a saavy lawyer could easily argue that it would represent an example of taxation without representation. emoticon_xagree",

   "Waxy, you're sounding more like a bleeding heart American liberal instead of a Canadian Socialist every post. :)\n\n \n Why? What does that mean? I wasn't even aware I was a Canadian socialist. emoticon_confused \n \n Anyhoo.\n \n \nWhy should anyone be forced to give money to a newly-created group that the majority don't think should even exist? Why should businesses be forced to support social experiments that they disagree with? \n \n \n The simple answer is the precedent has already been set. \n \n You're misinterpreting my stance as being pro handout, when in fact I'm only pro equality. You can eliminate all the handouts tomorrow, I'd be a happy man for the most part, but as long as they exist, I believe there should be equality in the way they are distributed. Taxpayers and businesses pay for things they disagree with everyday, that's a simple fact. You either have to give them the right to refuse to pay, or force them to pay equally. That seems pretty straight forward to me. Again, see the first sentence.\n \n As for private enterprise, they are not FORCED in any way to provide health benefits. They can just as easily choose not to provide health benefits to their employees if they feel that would be beneficial, as long as they do it equally.\n \n \nAnd you failed to make a significant distinction. The tax benefits that you \"are entitled to\" aren't based on your sexual orientation, they're based on your marital status. You get NO benefits from being a heterosexual nor do you lose any by being a homosexual.\n\n \n This is a red herring JP, and pretty simply, a false distinction. Your sexual orientation determines your ability to marry. Your marital status determines your tax/benefit situation.\n \n It's pretty simple to follow that if A requires B, and B is determined by C, then A is determined by C. \n \n A= tax benefits\n B= marriage\n C= sexual orientation\n \n \nWhat you gain through marriage are benefits that the government has deemed worthy of reinforcing/rewarding financially. It is no different from giving home owners a tax break on their mortgage interest because the government promotes property ownership of its citizens. And these benefits were given to the individuals through legislation written by Congress and signed into law by the President.\n \n \n I agree. HOWEVER.\n \n Are homosexuals prohibited from receiving tax breaks on home ownership?\n \n Why should homosexuals then be denied the right to marry and receive the accompanying benefits?\n \n What you've done here, is completely abandon your financial stance, and shift to a moral one - what the gov't, ie the citizens, deem morally right. (in your opinion). Which I would suggest, will ALWAYS be the basis of any anti gay marriage stance.\n \n \nGays don't want to go that route because it would be the kiss of death to their cause. Instead, they search out sympathetic minor governmental officials and judges who attempt to institute fiat laws that attempt to force policy AND COSTS on the citizens without their input. \n If gay marriages are allowed without Congressional involvement, a saavy lawyer could easily argue that it would represent an example of taxation without representation. emoticon_xagree\n\n \n Whatever, I don't want to get into this one.\n \n Waxy",

   "Here is more about Spitzer's unpublished study, and its sample, including what Spitzer himself has to say about it...\n \n He was disappointed, however, that many reports overlooked his statements explaining that his sample was limited and that he was not maintaining that a substantial number of gays and lesbians could become straight if they sought reparative therapy. \"For the vast majority it is not possible for them to change their sexual orientation,\" he said. \n \n Spitzer also acknowledged that \"a lot of people will misuse\" his findings, which could cause pain for many individuals. \"It may help 5,000 people, but harm 500,000,\" he said. He is concerned, he added, that \"the Christian right,\" with its intolerance of and opposition to homosexuality, will use his findings in its campaign to prevent gays and lesbians from gaining civil rights protections. \n \n http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/36/13/20\n \n Spitzer learned from Stalstrom that his study was being misused-an outcome about which he has been concerned since his study was publicized last spring. He then wrote to Karkkainen, the lawmaker leading the charge against the bill, saying that he was \"disturbed\" that his study results were being \"misused by those who are against antidiscrimination laws and civil unions for gays and lesbians.\" \n \n Spitzer explained that while his study results run counter \"to the current view of most mental health professionals,\" who maintain that homosexuals cannot change their sexual orientation, his report was \"based on a very unique sample.\" Such results \"are probably quite rare, even for highly motivated homosexuals,\" he said. \n \n He added in his letter to the parliament member that \"it would be a serious mistake to conclude\" from his research that homosexuality is a \"choice.\" \n \n He emphasized that he is concerned with \"scientific issues\" related to sexual orientation, and that he \"personally favor[s] antidiscrimination laws and civil unions for homosexuals.\" \n \n In an interview with Psychiatric News, Spitzer also rejected the argument made by Finnish opponents of civil unions, as well as some people who hailed his study results earlier this year, that the decision to remove homosexuality as a DSM-III diagnosis was a political decision in which APA succumbed to pressure from gay groups and their allies in the profession. That argument is \"nonsense,\" he emphasized. \"Both sides of the controversy were convinced that science was on their side\" when they made their decision. \n \n http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/36/24/11\n \n It had taken Spitzer more than 18 months to find just 200 or so people willing to describe themselves as successfully converted. He found his interviewees by advertising through ex-gay organisations. Almost half were recruited through ex-gay ministries, and nearly a quarter by Narth. Religion was \"extremely\" or \"very\" important to 93% of them. One in five was a mental health professional (Cohen, for example, is a high-profile reparative therapist) or director of an ex-gay ministry, and more than three-quarters had previously lobbied for sexual reorientation. These are people who get paid to say that therapy works. \n \n For many critics, this alone was enough to discredit the exercise. An article in the APA's Psychiatric News likened it to testing a drug on people recruited by the pharmaceutical company. But in addition, many of the participants appeared to have been not so much altered from gay to straight, as bisexual all along. Ten per cent of the men had never had gay sex before therapy, whereas half had already slept with a woman. Only a third of the women and half the men said that before therapy they were \"extremely\" bothered by homosexual feelings. How gay were they? \n \n As with most statistics, everything depends on how they are read. The percentage who were \"extremely bothered\" by homosexual feelings after undergoing therapy fell to zero. You could say zero was a sensational turnaround; or you might say they weren't so gay in the first place. Two New York psychologists carried out another study of reparative therapy at the same time as Spitzer, and reached the opposite conclusion. \"We interviewed 182 people who tried very hard to change,\" Dr Ariel Shidlo told Newsweek. \"The stakes were really high for them. Some really thought that if they didn't change, they would literally find themselves in hell... And they still failed.\" \n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1183596,00.html\n \n Drescher is concerned about the harm that patients can suffer after going through some of the conversion therapies, an issue not addressed in Spitzer's selective patient sample. \n \n \"Religious reparative therapies, like the faith healing from which they are derived, are a treatment modality that purports to provide definitive answers regarding human nature and sexuality. They always define homosexuality as wrong and require that individuals trying to change their sexual orientation submit to the therapist's authority as a condition of treatment,\" he said in his annual meeting presentation. \n \n In the type of interventions Spitzer assessed, \"it is the client's compliance with the therapist's authority, rather than the therapist's interpretations, that will determine the outcome of treatment,\" Drescher suggested. \"This is a clinical stance with troubling ethical implications.\"\n \n http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/36/13/20\n\n \n It all comes down to the fact thta it isn't definitive. ALso any program for rehabilitaiton works better if the poerson is religious and has family support. All Psitzer p[roves is that homosexuality isn't genetic. If it were genetic then it would be definitve. If it genetic they show where it is genetic and then that is it. You cant' deny the evidence if it existed.",

You're only argument is taht the sample taht is relgious and has family support is the most successful jsut like any other treatment. Religious and family supported poeple have the highest rates of success for any rehab. What's your point? Does that mean AA, drug rehab, gambling anonymous are phoney too?\n \n \n\n They certainly did.\nThat is relative.\n \n \n \n\n This is an argument to not allow any sexual relationship. Other things are different from homosexuality, and will have their unique standards, regardless of whether or not we accept gay people. If these others want to fight to have their relationships equally recognized, they will do so regardless of whether or not we accept gay relationships. This was essentially the point of Nature's Cry I believe, and it's a good one.\n\n No there is discrimination if we allow this behavior and others that fit the criteria in allowing homosexuality. Heterosexuality has a benefit. Heterosexuality is the foundation for civilization. HOmosexuality has no benefit.\n \n \n\n If the polling is flawed, as you say, how can we trust the numbers it produces? The numbers really have not remained steady over time. \n\n \n The change in polling is always relted to the margin of error. I don't beleive there really ahs been a big change opinion.",

Might not even have as many possible benefits as heterosexuality as it won't result in kids, but with adoption or IVF this is not an issue either. \n \n Heterosexuality is not the basis of civilisation, mutual self interest is. I think you will find that there are many heterosexual organisms in nature and they don't have civilisations.

I won't even say what any of us do, specifically, in our sexual activities, because that's no one's business.\n \n Heterosexuality in itself is not beneficial. Good families can be beneficial. Heterosexuality and heterosexual reproduction in and of itself, does not necessarily provide good families, free from abuse, abandonment, etc. Gay and lesbian people have ways of reproducing or adopting too, as Tastyfish mentioned. \n \n \nThat is different. RAce and behavior are not the same. We can regulate behavior but not race. Nudity and homosexualkiuyt are both behavior. Why does one deserve recognition and the other doesn't?\n\n \n Heterosexuality is behaviour too. Nudists can be married. They can't be nude in public. Perhaps we should just outlaw all sexual behaviour. Replace it with clean, safe, artificial inseminatin. Otherwise, people risk liking sex for the sex itself, or as a means to be social, and end up doing things which may not have what some believe is the most noticable benefit, namely reproduction. We could also evaluate people under law, to ensure only those who can provide a good family environment may reproduce.\n \n \nGood thing there are good reasons such as decency, morality, health, etc.\n\n \n These are all good reasons to fight prejudice.\n \n \nThat is relative.\n\n \n So was your original comment I responded to.\n \n \nThe change in polling is always relted to the margin of error.

You have deemed it \"behavior that is deemed unbeneficial, deviant, or a disorder and is not helpful to the public interest shall not receive and recognition\" but officially and medically it is not a disorder, deviant is a loaded word (again maybe true to your defintion but not the general understanding of it in this context.) or irrelevant and what is helpful to the public intrest is dubious as well (doesn't mean what the majority wants, but what is decided to be best for society overall).\n\n There is no official definition homosexuality being a non-disorder. There is only the APA DSM-IV decision which isn't the \"official\" declaratory use of homosexuality. Just as the American Bar Association doesn't determine what is legal for Attorneys or what should be the APA only represents most of its members views however they are not the worlwide decision makers on if it is a disorder or not.\n \n Also here is a definition of disorder.\n \n What is Abnormal?\n Before we can write about specific behavioral disorders, we must define 'abnormal'. And what is normal behavior?\n The following criteria are used to determine wheter a persons behavior is abnormal or not:\n \n Deviation from statistical norms;the word abnormal means 'away from the norm'. Many population facts are measured such as height, weight and intelligence. Most of the people fall within the middle range of intelligence, but a few are abnormally stupid. But according to this definition, a person who is extremely intelligent would be classified as abnormal. Thus in defining abnormal behavior we must consider more. \n Deviation from social norms; every vulture has certain standards for acceptable behavior; behavior that deviates from that standard is considered to be abnormal behavior. But those standards can change with time and vary from one society to another. \n Maladaptiveness of behavior; this third criterium is how the behavior affects the well-being of the individual and/or social group. Examples are a man who attempts suicide, an alcoholic who drinks so heavily that he or she cannot keep a job or a paranoid individual who tries to assasinate national leaders. \n Personal distress; the fourth criterium considers abnormality in terms of the individual's subjective feelings, personal distress, rather than his behavior. Most people diagnosed as 'mentally ill' feel miserable, anxious, depressed and may suffer from insomnia.\n In the type of abnormality called neurosis, personal distress may be the only symptom, because the individual's behavior seems normal. \n None of these definitions provides a complete description of abnormal behavior. The legal definition of abnormality declares a person insane when he is not able to judge between right and wrong, but this criterium is not used by psychologists. \n \n http://library.thinkquest.org/26618/en-4.1.1=defining%20abnormal%20behavior.htm\n \n Under this definition homosexuality falls under it.\n \n \n\n Clearly there is a benefit to homosexuality for homsexuals, you may not see the appeal but surely you can understand the benefit of loving someone you are attracted to? Might not even have as many possible benefits as heterosexuality as it won't result in kids, but with adoption or IVF this is not an issue either. \n\n This is an issue of self gratification. Polygamy, stock manipulation, voyerism, prostituion all have their benefits to the individual participants but not to society in general. How is homosexuality better than those?\n \n \n\n Heterosexuality is not the basis of civilisation, mutual self interest is. I think you will find that there are many heterosexual organisms in nature and they don't have civilisations. Cooperation and living together are the basis of civilisation, to me it seems that accepting and recognising homosexuality is more in line with the foundations of civilisation than not doing so. \n\n Do you know civilization means?\n \n Main Entry: civ\u00b7i\u00b7li\u00b7za\u00b7tion \n Pronunciation: \"si-v&-l&-'zA-sh&n\n Function: noun\n 1 a : a relatively high level of cultural and technological development; specifically : the stage of cultural development at which writing and the keeping of written records is attained  b : the culture characteristic of a particular time or place\n 2 : the process of becoming civilized\n 3 a : refinement of thought, manners, or taste b : a situation of urban comfort\n \n You better not resond to this because you obviously have proven that you are talking about things you know nothing about.",

   "Okay, kids, time to get back on track. When you start comparing countries in their cultures, you're not giving any logical input to this debate.\n \n See, the way I look at it, marriage is an agreement between two people to be devoted to each other and to remain faithful. Then, if it's a legal marriage, you have a piece of paper saying you are married, and blah blah blah. The main point here is, that regardless of our christian foundation in our culture, two people should be able to create a legal binding together if both people are willing to do so. \n \n No one can stop two people from swearing their love and devotion to each other, so to try and pretend we have any say so over it is pointless. People all over consider themselves married, even if they are not legally so. Has the foundation of our culture collapsed? I don't think so. And any problems in our society can be traced back alot further than lame excuses like \"tv violence\", or \"alternate lifestyles\".. so therefore those things cannot possibly be the cause. \n \n Sorry. so, long story short.. I thing gays should be allowed to marry. even if they had the same rights under a different name, I think that'd be okay.. but at the same time, I want people to understand that right now, \"civil unions\" do NOT entitle all the same rights and priviledges as marriage does.. so it's not equal yet. (for instance, there is no divorce process. ick, hu?)\n \n I just love how passionate people will get in denying rights to gays, when we could be worrying about real problems. I mean, Jesus H. Christ.. talk about messed up priorities.\n \n By the way, it WOULD be denying a group rights, since, there is no reason they cannot have them except legalities.. (i.e. no naturally occuring thing prevents it) that is, if the amendment passes. Right now, the technical wording would be something like \"omitting\" which is not the same as outright saying \"NO.\" I can understand why we have nothing in the constitution saying gays can marry.. we didn't think about it much back when it was first drafted. But hey, times change, Blacks and women can vote. I think this is a natural and inevitable part of changing history.",

   "I'm saying children need both a father figure and mother figure for the best development. Studies show taht it the best scenario for children.\n\n \n Oh, sure, believe what you want. No, actually, anyone with any common sense knows that the best environment for child-raising involves positive adult figures, regardless of gender, and the more positive figures, the better. Why is it though that it is theoretically good to have a female and male both? Well, exposure to different kinds of behaviors I suppose, so that they can pick and choose what ones they want to emulate. But really, any more, kids learn early on which gender parent they're supposed to become like (according to gender stereotypes they are exposed to almost constantly). Thusly, you get gender-rigid people who are unbalanced fundamentally. I mean, come on, like a y chromosome makes you inherently inconsiderate (a trait often blamed on merely being male).\n \n In fact, many MODERN studies (say, after 1990 or so) show that gender-rigid family environments (which make up most traditional families) are quite UNhealthy.. as they raise kids who learn to feel shame if they are not stereotypically male or female. To hear some horror stories of that degree, read Gender Shock by Phyllis Burke. She has case files of children admitted to \"gender correction clinics\" for things like girls not wanting to wear dresses.. the results were devistating. Kids given shock therapy.. being told to hate who they were.. it's sick. but anyways.. I just hate it when people say that kids do best with a mother and a father. How about just having good human beings raising them for a change? Who cares what gender their parents are, so long as they love and care for them? I for one think that people value the wrong things alot. People are lucky to get caring parents anymore, so why care if there is only one, or two of the same sex, as long as they do a good job?\n \n People.. -_- *sighs*\n \n \n May I also add, that your posts are generally not linear.. I can't follow them well at all. I might recommend learning better grammar.",

There are many who die from an assortment of STDs unrelated to AIDS.\n\n \n which perhaps does not read as you intended, but is fairly clear to me in its assertion that homosexual sex kills. When it comes to this assertion - \n \n You are wrong. Plain and simple. Heterosexual sex between two consenting, disease free adults is no more likely to kill someone than heterosexual sex between two consenting, disease free adults.\n \n Like I said - Unsafe sex kills.\n \n While some sexual acts performed by homosexuals (and heterosexuals as well) have greater risks of disease transmission, that does not make homsexual sex more deadly. What the education should be aimed at is increasing the awareness of these diseases and safe sex within the gay community. That and a recognition/affirmation of the monogamous lifestyle among homosexuals would reduce infection rates and increase the lifespan of the average homosexual.\n \n What you have proven, albeit somewhat tenuously, is that there is a higher disease rate among homosexuals that translates into shorter life spans. \n \n This in no way invalidates their right to marry, and even more significantly, the claim that it does would have massive ripple affects on the ability to marry based on health/fitness that could lead to sci-fi type results.\n \n Quite simply, higher disease rates among homosexuals is irrelevent to this debate IMHO, but if you want to start a new debate on whether or not we should allow people to marry based on their health, or potential risk of health problems, go right ahead. It should be interesting.\n \n Waxy",

   "The purpose of his argument is to remind people that homosexuality is wrong. It is not based on fear. Society used to consider it to be wrong but has since changed its mind. Now it is often not just tolerated but lauded. This is an argument against homosexuality (or the actions of homosexuals), not the homosexuals themselves. Please note the difference. Homosexuality is not a particularly worse type of immorality but people seem to have forgotten that homosexuality is even wrong at all. \n \n What if criminals adapted the model that the homosexual community used in \"coming out\" in society? Homosexuality has long been illegal in most, if not all, of the United States of America. Despite that, homosexuals announced their presence and avoided prosecution by claiming invasion of privacy and \"consenting adults\" arguments. \n \n Here is the example I'm trying to make: Get a group of the same type of criminals together, have them announce their crime at a large public gathering, call their crime a \"lifestyle choice\" or something similar, and make a lot of noise about fair treatment of all people (by fair treatment of all people they would mean special treatment for their group, but that would not be known to the public until the law was passed that gives the criminals special favors). \n Sound familiar?\n\n \n Homosexuals are not criminals.\n \n They are not doing anything that directly impacts or harms you.\n \n This is simply an absurd argument.\n \n Waxy",

I have my own anectodotal evidence of the many gay people I know, myself included, who have never had health problems. I won't even say what any of us do, specifically, in our sexual activities, because that's no one's business.\n\n This isn't hearsay this is statistical facts. Do you want me post them up?\n Here is just one fact.\n FDA Committee Votes Against Relaxing Donor Ban\n \n By Becky Orfinger, Staff Writer \n \n For the past 15 years, any man who has had sex with another man since 1977 - even once - has been permanently banned from donating blood because of the high prevalence of AIDS in the gay male population. At a meeting yesterday of an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration, government scientists voted to uphold this policy, cited as discriminatory by many gay rights activists. \n \n FDA medical officer Andrew Dayton asked the Blood Products Advisory Committee (BPAC) whether it was prudent to change the donor deferral policy to ban only men who disclosed having sex with another man within the last five years. Dayton and his colleagues analyzed the projected risk that relaxing the donor deferral rule would have on the nation's blood supply and presented the committee with this data. After much deliberation, the BPAC members voted 7 to 6 to maintain the current deferral policy. \n \n Dr. Rebecca Haley, interim chief medical officer for the American Red Cross, told the committee that the Red Cross did not support changing the current ban on blood donation by from men who have engaged in homosexual behavior during the past 24 years because of the risk of introducing HIV-positive blood into the national blood supply. Although Dayton's risk analysis found that \"introduction of a five year floating deferral for male-to-male sexual behavior, even using conservative estimates, would result in minimal increased morbidity in the blood supply by HIV,\" the Red Cross urged caution in changing a policy that so far has kept the blood supply virtually free of tainted blood. \n http://www.redcross.org/news/archives/2000/9-15-00b.html\n \n \n \n \n\n Heterosexuality in itself is not beneficial. Good families can be beneficial. Heterosexuality and heterosexual reproduction in and of itself, does not necessarily provide good families, free from abuse, abandonment, etc. Gay and lesbian people have ways of reproducing or adopting too, as Tastyfish mentioned. \n\n Heterosexuality is goog in itself. It healthy for people to engage in sex when it's done appropriately. \n In one of the most credible studies correlating overall health with sexual frequency, Queens University in Belfast tracked the mortality of about 1,000 middle-aged men over the course of a decade. The study was designed to compare persons of comparable circumstances, age and health. Its findings, published in 1997 in the British Medical Journal, were that men who reported the highest frequency of orgasm enjoyed a death rate half that of the laggards.

After several years of growing tolerance, the survey shows a return to a level of more traditional attitudes last seen in the mid-1990s. \n Asked whether same-sex relations between consenting adults should be legal, 48% said yes; 46% said no. Before this month, support hadn't been that low since 1996. (Related item: See poll numbers)\n \n In early May, support for legal relations reached a high of 60%-35%.\n \n The shift in attitudes occurs as gay issues have been in the news. In recent weeks, the Supreme Court struck down a Texas anti-sodomy law, a Canadian court decision allowed gay couples to marry in Ontario, and Wal-Mart expanded anti-discrimination protection to gay workers.\n \n Conservative social activists see a backlash to those developments and the growing visibility of gay characters in entertainment, including such TV shows as Will & Grace. \"The more that the movement demands the endorsement of the law and the culture, the more resistance there will be,\" says Gary Bauer, president of American Values.\n \n Bauer says that sentiment will make it harder for elected officials to avoid taking positions on such questions as a proposed constitutional amendment that would bar marriage of gay couples.\n \n Advocates for gay men and lesbians called the poll disappointing. \"Clearly, the debate (over recent developments) has had an effect,\" says David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign. But over time, he says, \"The country always ends up on the side of fairness, and I think they will here, too.\"\n \n Those making the biggest shifts included African-Americans. On whether homosexual relations should be legal, their support fell from 58% in May to 36% in July. Among people who attend church almost every week, support fell from 61% to 49%.\n \n The survey also found rising opposition to civil unions that would give gay couples some of the rights of married heterosexuals. They were opposed 57%-40%, the most opposition since the question was first asked in 2000.\n \n By 49%-46%, those polled said homosexuality should not be considered \"an acceptable alternative lifestyle.\" It was the first time since 1997 that more people expressed opposition than support.\n \n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-07-28-poll_x.htm",

   "Okay, kids, time to get back on track. When you start comparing countries in their cultures, you're not giving any logical input to this debate.\n \n See, the way I look at it, marriage is an agreement between two people to be devoted to each other and to remain faithful. Then, if it's a legal marriage, you have a piece of paper saying you are married, and blah blah blah. The main point here is, that regardless of our christian foundation in our culture, two people should be able to create a legal binding together if both people are willing to do so. \n \n No one can stop two people from swearing their love and devotion to each other, so to try and pretend we have any say so over it is pointless. People all over consider themselves married, even if they are not legally so. Has the foundation of our culture collapsed? I don't think so. And any problems in our society can be traced back alot further than lame excuses like \"tv violence\", or \"alternate lifestyles\".. so therefore those things cannot possibly be the cause. \n \n Sorry. so, long story short.. I thing gays should be allowed to marry. even if they had the same rights under a different name, I think that'd be okay.. but at the same time, I want people to understand that right now, \"civil unions\" do NOT entitle all the same rights and priviledges as marriage does.. so it's not equal yet.

(i.e. no naturally occuring thing prevents it) that is, if the amendment passes. Right now, the technical wording would be something like \"omitting\" which is not the same as outright saying \"NO.\" I can understand why we have nothing in the constitution saying gays can marry.. we didn't think about it much back when it was first drafted.

   " Oh, sure, believe what you want. No, actually, anyone with any common sense knows that the best environment for child-raising involves positive adult figures, regardless of gender, and the more positive figures, the better. Why is it though that it is theoretically good to have a female and male both? Well, exposure to different kinds of behaviors I suppose, so that they can pick and choose what ones they want to emulate. But really, any more, kids learn early on which gender parent they're supposed to become like (according to gender stereotypes they are exposed to almost constantly). Thusly, you get gender-rigid people who are unbalanced fundamentally. I mean, come on, like a y chromosome makes you inherently inconsiderate (a trait often blamed on merely being male).\n\n \n That's a sounds theoretically possible but not probable. There is no evidence to support thst.\n \n \"Research shows the best environment for a child is one where both a mother and a father are present and committed to each other and the development of the child. Research also reveals that the presence of a father in the home determines a child's cognitive and verbal skills, academic performance and curbs high-risk behavior- not to mention the impact on a child's emotional and psychological health,\" Bydalek said.\n \n http://www.familyfirst.org/news_releases/gay_adoption.shtml\n \n \n The ideal family environment for a child is to be raised by their married mother and father.\n Thirty years of social science research has shown the consequences for both children and adults when mother-father marriage is not present (crime, poverty, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, school failure, and mental, emotional and physical problems). \n \n Women and men bring together the different and complimentary gifts needed to most effectively raise children. \n \n By legally redefining marriage, we would be making a decision that marriage no longer has anything to do with making babies and that children no longer need either a mother or father in their lives.\n \n http://www.familiesnorthwest.org/dynpage.cfm?DPID=612\n \n \n \n \n\n In fact, many MODERN studies (say, after 1990 or so) show that gender-rigid family environments (which make up most traditional families) are quite UNhealthy.. as they raise kids who learn to feel shame if they are not stereotypically male or female. To hear some horror stories of that degree, read Gender Shock by Phyllis Burke. She has case files of children admitted to \"gender correction clinics\" for things like girls not wanting to wear dresses.. the results were devistating. Kids given shock therapy.. being told to hate who they were.. it's sick. but anyways.. I just hate it when people say that kids do best with a mother and a father. How about just having good human beings raising them for a change? Who cares what gender their parents are, so long as they love and care for them? I for one think that people value the wrong things alot. People are lucky to get caring parents anymore, so why care if there is only one, or two of the same sex, as long as they do a good job? \n\n Yes people are lucky if they have two parents. It does not change the fact that the best environment is two paren t household. That book is one study about a small percentage of the population suffering from disorders and you're making an inference about the meaning.\n \n \n People.. \n \n \n\n May I also add, that your posts are generally not linear..

Resnick, PhD, and Robert Blum, MD, PhD \n \n Objectives. This study examined the relationship between sexual orientation and suicide risk in a population-based sample of adolescents. \n \n Methods. Participants were selected from a cross-sectional, statewide survey of junior and senior public high school students. All males (n = 212) and females (n = 182) who described themselves as bisexual/homosexual were compared with 336 gender-matched heterosexual respondents on three outcome measures: suicidal ideation, intent, and self-reported attempts. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between sexual orientation and outcome measures with adjustment for demographic characteristics. \n \n Results. Suicide attempts were reported by 28.1% of bisexual/homosexual males, 20.5% of bisexual/homosexual females, 14.5% of heterosexual females, and 4.2% of heterosexual males. For males, but not females, bisexual/homosexual orientation was associated with suicidal intent (odds ratio [OR] = 3.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.40, 9.36) and attempts (OR = 7.10; 95% CI = 3.05, 16.53). \n \n Conclusions. There is evidence of a strong association between suicide risk and bisexuality or homosexuality in males. (Am J Public Health. 1998;88:57*60) \n \n http://www.apha.org/journal/abstracts/remaf.htm\n \n Men who have sex with men may identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or even heterosexual. No matter what label is used, the fact is that these men are at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, anal cancer, and psychologic and behavioral disorders.1\n \n The rate of men who had sex with men in the previous year was thought to be 1.7 to 2 percent. However, surveys from 1996 to 2000 indicate that the rate is at least 3.1 to 3.7 percent.2 This discrepancy indicates that male-male sexual behavior often is underreported, and that previous estimates of the number of men who have sex with men may be too low. Therefore, a typical family physician can expect 3 percent or more of his or her male patients to be men who have had sex with men in the previous year.\n \n Recent trends indicate a resurgence in risky behaviors that expose men who have sex with men to HIV infection and other STDs. The reported prevalence of men engaging in un-protected anal intercourse increased from 37 percent in 1993-1994 to 50 percent in 1996-1997.3 Disease risk frequently is not assessed, especially in younger men, in part because of numerous impediments to adequate care under the current health care system.4\n \n http://www.aafp.org/afp/20040501/2149.html\n \n \n 4.3.1 Recent studies have reported Bisexual people to have worse mental health than their homosexual or heterosexual counterparts due to more adverse life events and less positive support from family and friends15. Bisexual people may also be at greater risk of STIs due to a lack of targeted health promotion activities.16\n \n http://www.ama.com.au/web.nsf/doc/WEEN-5GA2YX\n \n \n Psychiatric disorders were more prevalent among homosexually active people compared with heterosexually active people. Homosexual men had a higher 12-month prevalence of mood disorders (odds ratio [OR] = 2.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.54-5.57) and anxiety disorders (OR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.44-4.74) than heterosexual men. Homosexual women had a higher 12-month prevalence of substance use disorders (OR = 4.05; 95% CI = 1.56-10.47) than heterosexual women. Lifetime prevalence rates reflect identical differences, except for mood disorders, which were more frequently observed in homosexual than in heterosexual women (OR = 2.41; 95% CI = 1.26-4.63). The proportion of persons with 1 or more diagnoses differed only between homosexual and heterosexual women (lifetime OR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.31-5.19). More homosexual than heterosexual persons had 2 or more disorders during their lifetimes (homosexual men: OR = 2.70; 95% CI = 1.66-4.41; homosexual women: OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.07-4.09). \n \n These studies were done in the Netherlands where it's more almost completely accxeptable.\n \n \n Same-Sex Sexual Behavior and Psychiatric Disorders \n Findings From the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS) \n \n Theo G.

How is homosexuality worse than those? It doesn't actively harm someone like stock manipulation, is done with consent unlike voyerism and doesn't have the links to crime prostitution does. In fact it is unlike those at all, which is why it is better. \n\n Going to the cinema, keeping fit, decorating rooms, etc all benefit society in improving the health, safety, and public welfare.\n \n Stock maniupulatrioon doesnt harm anyone.\n \n Homosexuality is illegal in much of teh world. /so is ti wrong in thsoe countries?\n \n \n\n I have no idea what I am talking about, you're the one saying tolerance has caused earthquakes, homosexuality is the same kind of thing as stock manipulation, giving defintions of disorder that actually include 'and some other stuff' as part of them. I think you are the one not entirely grounded in reality here. Exactly how is marriage the foundation of civilisation from those three compared to the actual basis of civilisation MAKING LIVING TOGETHER MORE BENEFICIAL THAN LIVING ALONE. Without the foundation of a society you have no advancement of the standard of living or any civilisation. Exactly how did marraige lead to the formation of writing, or could it possibly be that writing emerged as a way to pass information to people you live with and their descendants? Single parents clearly have no part in civilisation and are at the same level of development as cats and dogs, orgnaisms that have no marriage and thus no civlisation. Really, at least pretend to understand the points people are making before you rubbish them \n\n I never said homosexuality caused earthquakes.\n \n Marrigae is teh foudnation of families. Famil;ies is what society is based upon. It is proven that people from stable two aprent homes generally are better prpared and do better in society.\n \n Before I answer your line of single parent learn what civilzation is before I answer them. Single clearly ahve not contributed to society as homes with two parents. The evidence is clearly there.",

   "Originally Posted by Tastyfish\n \n You define abnormal behaviour but state that you are defining a mental disorder, lets not mix terms here. First two points are irrelevant and are only included to attempt to put a preemptive link in. The first is too vague (as it states, not really sure why it bothers seeing as it is defining a mental disorder rather than abnormal really) and the second has nothing to do with the topic. Women exposing anything other than fingers and eyes is against social values in islamic theocracies, is this anything physiological?\n maladaptive behaviour isn't relevant as the majority of problems are caused by the intolerance and lack of acceptance from others (intolerance fits this definition far better, seeing as it is also against the norm and against the social values, should this be a mentla disorder). There is no compulsive or self destructive behaviour that results from homosexuality, there may be a correlation with some harmful behaviours but these are correlations and not consquences (but even then the studies listed here were a little dubious). Finally while a large number of people who feel anxious miserable and depressed may suffer from insomnia, but equally a lot may feel it because some event is making them feel miserable and anxious. Under that definition homosexuality may fit, but not very well. isn;t really a definition\n The American Psychiatric Association Coup\n \n Homosexuals commonly point to the fact that the 'medical community' and, more specifically, psychiatrists agree with them that homosexuality is a \"normal human sexual response.\"\n \n It is certainly true that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its list of \"mental disorders\" twenty years ago, in 1973. This is a fact that almost always comes up in debates with sodomites.\n \n What the homosexuals do not mention, of course, is that this sudden change in attitude was not based on any new scientific evidence. As described in the following paragraphs, it was a purely political move, induced by a relentless saturation campaign of deception, intimidation, and unethical collusion between the APA committee and activist sodomite groups.\n \n Preparing the Ground:\n \n In 1968, representatives of activist homosexual groups approached leading psychiatrists and the officers of psychiatric organizations and began to lay the groundwork for the reclassification of their perversions as normal manifestations of human sexuality. \n \n These activists correctly recognized that such a move was absolutely mandatory if they were to win public acceptance. After all, society in general would not look very kindly upon the subsequent lobbying done by a group whose members were officially recognized as \"mentally disordered.\" \n \n In the three years during which the APA's Homosexuality Task Force was deliberating, it collaborated actively with several sodomite groups, including the Gay Activist's Alliance, the Mattachine Society, and the Daughters of Bilitis, while completely ignoring organizations with views that contrasted with the homosexuals. \n \n Abram Kardiner, former Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University, revealed that \"A powerful lobby of \"gay\" organizations has brought pressure on the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from the category of aberrancy. This is only one facet of the tidal wave of egalitarianism and divisiveness that is sweeping the country....\"\n \n During this unethical collusion, Kinsey colleague Paul Gebhard said that anyone who was known to harbor the view that homosexuality was a disorder was systematically excluded from being a member of the Task Force or from even being able to present his views or evidence to it.\n \n In other words, the sodomites packed this committee in the same manner that pro-abortionist and fetal tissue harvesters do: Only those people with the \"correct\" viewpoint were allowed to voice an opinion.\n \n But the homosexuals did not focus on the APA alone; they intimidated psychiatrists all over the nation. While the APA Task Force ws preparing its report, any psychiatrist or psychoanalyst who dared present documentation that homosexuality was a psychological disorder (anywhere in the country) was shouted down and even physically attacked at public forums or at local and national meetings of mental health professionals.\n \n The APA Caves In:\n \n The years of hard work put in by the sodomites began to pay off in 1972. The \"National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Task Force on Homosexuality Final Report\" parroted Alfred Kinsey's proclamation that \"exclusive heterosexuality\" and exclusive homosexuality\" were \"sexual extremes,\" and that most people were basically bisexual.\n \n This report in turn exerted a great deal of influence on the APA. In order to make its final report appear to be scientific, the APA's Homosexuality Task Force sent a letter to all APA member psychiatritst. This letter did not ask whether or not homosexuality should or should not be declared \"normal.\" It was signed by all candidates for the upcoming elections for the APA presidency and urged all members to \"vote\" that homosexuality was thereafter declared to be on a level with normal sexuality.\n \n This view was so voted by a very slim margin. The letter did not, of course, reveal the fact that it was written and funded by the National Gay Task Force. One of the letter's signers, in fact, later confessed that he knew that such knowledge would have been the \"kiss of death\" for a pro homosexual vote. \n \n Subsequently, the APA eliminated homosexuality as a mental disorder from the 1973 edition of its \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.\"\n \n APA member Dr. Henry W. Reicken cut to the heart of the APA's motivation as he wrote a scathing dissent in the appendix to the above mentioned NIMH report entitled \"Detailed Reservations Regarding the Task Force Recommendations on Social Policy:\" \"It is as if they 'the Task Force' said, \"Here is a phenomenon about which we know almost nothing and about which there is a great deal of anxiety and concern; therefore, let us suggest a major revision in public policy for dealing with this phenomenon.\" I cannot escape the belief that this is an utterly unreasonable conclusion to draw from the sea of ignorance and misinformation in which we find ourselves.\"\n \n The Essential Point:\n \n The essential point to be made about this chicanery is that the sudden complete reversal in the APA position on homosexuality was not brought about as a result of a careful regime of scholarly research and study; it was a blatantly political move, a 'vote', of all things, on the status of a mental illness. Furthermore, this vote was undertaken in a climate of deception and intimidation.\n \n At no time before or since has the APA or any other psychological or psychiatric professional group 'ever' addressed a mental health question in this manner.\n \n Behind the Scenes:\n \n It is fascinating indeed to see what psychiatrists 'really' think about homosexuality when they are free of the restraints of intimidation and political pressure.\n \n Almost simultaneously with the 1972 National Institute of Mental Health report, the New York County District Branch of the APA's Task Force on Homosexuality produced a second report. According to APA member Charles Socarides, M.D., the document concluded that \"....exclusive homosexuality was a disorder of psychosexual development, and simultaneously asked for civil rights for those suffering from the disorder.\" \n \n It is even more revealing to examine the results of polls of psychiatrists taken since 1973 regarding the issue of homosexual orientation. \n \n The original \"voting\" letter distributed by the APA Homosexuality Task Force in 1973 was answered by only about one-quarter of the recipients, leading one to speculate that the \"volunteer bias\" ignored by Kinsey in his original studies led to pro-homosexual results. It is quite certain that, if 'all' of the APA members had returned their \"ballots,\" homosexuality would have remained a mental disorder in the view of the organization.\n \n A later series of private surveys which could be answered confidentially and without fear of retaliation showed that two-thirds of APA members psychiatrists regarded homosexuality as abnormal despite the parent organization's switch\n \n More specifically, in 1977, four years after the APA 'switch,' the journal \"Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality\" revealed that it had polled 2,500 psychiatrists on their view of what \"current thinking on homosexuality\" was, and, by a lopsided margin of 69% to 18% (nearly four to one, with 13%undecided). the respondents answered that \"Homosexuality was usually a pathological adaptation as opposed to a normal variation.\"\n \n This is certainly a more accurate poll than the original APA letter because the letter was subject to all of the \"volunteer bias\" that self selected populations exhibit. However, by comparison, the 1977 survey was truly random, and so its results should certainly be given more weight. \n \n \n \n courtesy of: EWTN.com",

   "mana'ia, the studies you've posted don't take into account the many which show that the rejection and the lack of support they receive is a factor in suicide among gay and lesbian people...\n \n Of the 10 studies, 6 explored risks for suicide by comparing attemptors and nonattemptors. They found that suicide attempts were neither universal nor attributable to homosexuality per se, but they were significantly associated with gender nonconformity,3 early awareness of homosexuality,3, 8, 11, 14 stress,12 violence,14 lack of support,8, 11, 14 school drop-out,12 family problems,8 acquaintances' suicide attempts,12 homelessness,12 and substance abuse3 or other psychiatric symptoms.6, 11, 14 \n \n Surveys large enough to examine sex differences among Minnesota15 and Massachusetts students19 found a significant association between homosexuality and suicidality in males only. Suicide risk factors such as gender nonconformity may be particularly detrimental to boys.15, 19 \n \n http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/282/13/1291\n \n \n Results. Homosexual and bisexual individuals more frequently than heterosexual persons reported both lifetime and day-to-day experiences with discrimination. Approximately 42% attributed this to their sexual orientation, in whole or part. Perceived discrimination was positively associated with both harmful effects on quality of life and indicators of psychiatric morbidity in the total sample. Controlling for differences in discrimination experiences attenuated observed associations between psychiatric morbidity and sexual orientation. \n \n Conclusions. Higher levels of discrimination may underlie recent observations of greater psychiatric morbidity risk among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.\n \n http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/11/1869\n \n The studies showing more prevelence for mental health issues among some gays and lebians are nowhere near levels of pathology which would indicate that homosexuality itself is inherently pathological. \n \n Suicide down, acceptance of gays and lesbians may be a factor...\n \n http://www.advocate.com/new_news.asp?id=12745&sd=06/12/04-06/14/04\n \n Substance use:\n \n http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/92/2/198\n \n Jaaaman, that one survey of yours from 1977, is out of date. More recent surveys have been done...\n It was reported that 47.3% of psychiatric training directors view homosexuality as normal or somewhat normal, 51.2% view homosexuality as neutral, and 1.5% view it as somewhat pathological or pathological. \n Townsend-1995, Academic Psychiatry 19:213-218\n \n Hispanic and white women have a higher lifetime prevalence of depression (24 percent and 22 percent, respectively) than black women (16 percent). Furthermore, when surveyed in 1991, nearly twice as large a share of Hispanic women (11 percent) reported being depressed as did black and white women (nearly 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively) (80). \n \n A 1993 survey found Hispanic women (53 percent) more likely to suffer from severe depression than either non-Hispanic black (47 percent) or white (37 percent) women (13). \n \n http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/figure41.htm\n \n Although small shares of all female high school seniors in 1985-1989 reported current cocaine use (used one or more times during the preceding 30 days), by 1995, the largest reported use of both cocaine and crack (or freebase cocaine use) was among Hispanic females. In 1985-1989, 9 percent of American Indian/ Alaska Native and 4 percent of white female high school seniors acknowledged cocaine use during the preceding 30 days. About 3 percent of Mexican American, Puerto Rican and other Latin American, and Asian American females, along with 1 percent of black females, also reported use (161). However, in the 1995 YRBSS, Hispanic adolescent females were most likely to report ever having tried any form of cocaine (powder, crack, or freebase)-15 percent-and also ever having tried crack (12 percent). \n \n http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/adolesc.htm#SUBSTANCEABUSE\n \n I don't think we will be aborting Hispanic fetuses, despite these statistics.

The rebels attack that which is really the thing that will do them (and us) most good.\n\n \n Most pyschoanalysts don't even support this type of nonsense anymore...\n \n POSITION STATEMENT ON REPARATIVE THERAPY\n \n \n \n \n \n The American Psychoanalytic Association affirms the following positions:\n \n \n 1. Same-gender sexual orientation cannot be assumed to represent a deficit in personality development or the expression of psychopathology.\n \n \n 2. As with any societal prejudice, anti-homosexual bias negatively affects mental health, contributing to an enduring sense of stigma and pervasive self-criticism in people of same-gender sexual orientation through the internalization of such prejudice.\n \n \n 3. As in all psychoanalytic treatments, the goal of analysis with homosexual patients is understanding. Psychoanalytic technique does not encompass purposeful efforts to \"convert\" or \"repair\" an individual's sexual orientation. Such directed efforts are against fundamental principles of psychoanalytic treatment and often result in substantial psychological pain by reinforcing damaging internalized homophobic attitudes.\n http://www.apsa-co.org/ctf/cgli/reparative_therapy.htm",

   " It seems that some people *coughmana'iacough* think that because many people from a give group have an unsavory lifestyle, that the group in question should be judged all the same. If you were going for logical reasons as to why gays shouldn't have equal rights, then you totally missed.. I mean, do I think that just because some african americans join gangs and commit crimes that none of them should be able to vote per say? Of course not. (although I wish many types of people wouldn't vote, I'd never try and enforce that) That's called discrimination. Didn't your parents teach you that's bad? Oh, that's right, although you're arguing about the gays who have promiscuous lifestyles and spread disease, you actually think any one of them is immoral. So why argue anything but why you think it's bad? Possibly.. because you know that reason means nill with most people here?\n\n The argument is that marriage does not need to be changed. it is considered an insitution for building families. We don't want to change that. Anything you want done that marriage grants you can do without marriage. There are very few exceptions. the fact is taht gays want marriage rights as a form of saying taht their behavior is acceptable and should be recognized by the government. We do nto accept that and don;t have to accept that.\n \n Discrimination only occurs if we treat them as less which we don't. They in fac thave more rights because tehya re covered under hate crime laws.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n And that earthquake stuff.. you're just an overzealous fundamentalist who, like almost all of that vareity, is always looking for signs of the end of the world.

   "More on this issue of suicide, including statistics from outside the gay community...\n \n An article in the December issue of APA's Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology points to a possible cause of seemingly higher rates of suicide among LGB and transgendered (LGBT) youth: discrepancies between what gay youth report about suicide attempts and what they're actually doing. \n \n The article, by Cornell University's Ritch C. Savin-Williams, PhD, reports on two studies that conclude that even though sexual-minority teens are more likely than heterosexual youth to report suicide attempts, half of those reports are false--that is, the young people had thought about suicide but hadn't acted on it. In addition, Savin-Williams found, many of the true attempts the young people reported weren't life-threatening. \n \n \"When you ask in-depth questions about suicide attempts, the responses you get account for the rate differences between heterosexual and sexual minority youth suicide,\" Savin-Williams says. \"The heterosexual youth had hardly any false attempts, while those with same-sex attractions had a lot of them.\" \n \n In one of the studies, 23 percent of 83 young sexual-minority women said they'd attempted suicide at least once. On further questioning, though, 29 percent of the reported attempts turned out to be false, and 80 percent of the true attempts were not life-threatening, Savin-Williams writes. The one exception was a small number of young women who were part of a support group, whose rate of actual suicide attempts was much higher than others in the sample. \n \n In the other study, Savin-Williams compared reported suicide attempts in 126 young sexual-minority young people and 140 young heterosexual men and women. Again, while sexual-minority men and women were far more likely to report suicide attempts than heterosexual subjects, the two groups showed similar rates of true suicide attempts. \n \n The findings suggest that gay youth are vulnerable to the media's and researchers' well-meaning but negative depictions of gay youth as highly troubled people heading on a collision course with life, Savin-Williams maintains. \n \n \"There's a script we have in our culture--a 'suffering suicidal' script--that these kids have picked up on,\" he says. A better approach for researchers, teachers and other youth workers, he believes, is to treat all young LGBT people as ordinary kids with great potential, unless they show research-based or visible indicators of suicide risk. \n \n http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/newdata.html\n \n Suicide facts and figures \n * 11.3 per 100,000, or 30,575 Americans, completed suicide in 1998. \n \n * More people die from suicide than from homicide. In 1998, there were 1.7 times as many suicides as homicides. \n \n * Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death for all Americans. \n \n * Males are four times more likely to die from suicide than females, but females are more likely to attempt suicide than males. \n \n * In 1998, white males accounted for 73 percent of all suicides. Together, white males and white females accounted for more than 90 percent of all suicides. \n \n * Between 1979 and 1992, suicide rates for Native Americans were 1.5 times the national average. Native American males ages 15 to 24 accounted for 64 percent of these suicides. \n \n * Three out of five suicides were completed with a firearm in 1998. \n \n * Suicide rates are highest among Americans aged 65 years and older. In 1998, men accounted for 83 percent of these suicides. \n \n * In 1998, people younger than 25 accounted for 15 percent of all suicides. \n \n * From 1952 to 1995, the suicide rate among adolescents and young adults nearly tripled. \n \n * From 1980 to 1997, the suicide rate among those ages 15 to 19 increased by 11 percent, and among youngsters 10 to 14 by 109 percent. \n \n * From 1980 to 1996, the suicide rate for African-American males ages 15 to 19 increased 105 percent. \n \n * Suicide is the third leading cause of death for young people ages 15 to 24, after unintentional injury and homicide. \n \n http://www.apa.org/monitor/nov01/suicidefacts.html\n \n \n The Netherlands still had homophobia when that one study was done, posted by mana'ia, where the site claimed, oooh it was the Netherlands, so the envirnoment was too accepting to possibly lead to suicide...\n \n http://www.gayteens.org/714/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=578&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0\n \n http://www.rnw.nl/holland/html/030512gays.html",

The constitution is silent on marriage, there is no \"right.\" If the gov't decided tomorrow to do away with marriage completly, there's nothing anyone could do about it.\n \n The law in the US right now says that in order to recieve a marriage license, there must be one man and one woman. Some activist judges decided to interpret the word \"woman\" and \"man\" as meaning the same thing - being interchangable... which is completely false. That's the purpose two different words were used - to distuinguish a difference - to say that they are not the same, but two different things! There never was a \"right\" for homosexuals to marry one another. The reason that marriage is in the gov't is because it was popular and became a pilar of society. That's how the people wanted it.

They found that suicide attempts were neither universal nor attributable to homosexuality per se, but they were significantly associated with gender nonconformity,3 early awareness of homosexuality,3, 8, 11, 14 stress,12 violence,14 lack of support,8, 11, 14 school drop-out,12 family problems,8 acquaintances' suicide attempts,12 homelessness,12 and substance abuse3 or other psychiatric symptoms.6, 11, 14 \n \n Surveys large enough to examine sex differences among Minnesota15 and Massachusetts students19 found a significant association between homosexuality and suicidality in males only. Suicide risk factors such as gender nonconformity may be particularly detrimental to boys.15, 19 \n \n http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/282/13/1291\n\n Remeber these are only factors. Even in the netherlands they still have higher rates even if they are more accepted.\n \n \n \n \n \nResults. Homosexual and bisexual individuals more frequently than heterosexual persons reported both lifetime and day-to-day experiences with discrimination. Approximately 42% attributed this to their sexual orientation, in whole or part. Perceived discrimination was positively associated with both harmful effects on quality of life and indicators of psychiatric morbidity in the total sample. Controlling for differences in discrimination experiences attenuated observed associations between psychiatric morbidity and sexual orientation. \n \n Conclusions. Higher levels of discrimination may underlie recent observations of greater psychiatric morbidity risk among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.\n \n http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/11/1869\n \n The studies showing more prevelence for mental health issues among some gays and lebians are nowhere near levels of pathology which would indicate that homosexuality itself is inherently pathological. \n \n Suicide down, acceptance of gays and lesbians may be a factor...\n \n http://www.advocate.com/new_news.asp?id=12745&sd=06/12/04-06/14/04\n\n Considering you and others see non-acceptance of lifestyle as discrimination it wold make me feel paranoid too.

Those who \"Prefer\" to drive on the left side of the road are endangering right side drivers.\n Homosexuals are NOT endangering any heterosexual.\n \n You may think your analogy is simplistic and in that altruistic. But what you have forgotten is logic. The reason there are laws is to protect people. Laws against Homosexual marriage protects NO ONE. It does the opposite. It denies protection to one specific group of people out of hate, misunderstanding and fear. \n There are no laws against persons who write with their left hand, but if a southpaw says that it was his/her right as a left hand writter to murder someone, that's going outside the bounds of logic and reason. \n To allow homosexual marriages is not at all on the same level of allowing syblings to marry either. Syblings run a high risk of passing on genetic mutations to subsequent offspring. Physical and biological mutations which could be life threatening.\n Homosexuals cannot reproduce in a sexual encounter between themselves. They are physically and physiologically able to reproduce, but not with each other. Homosexuals do have offspring, but the likelihood of passing on genetic mutations is no higher or lower than that of heterosexuals who are non-related by blood.",

(ie Vampirism)\n 9) Intravienious drug use from a shared needle is a potential risk.\n 10) Medical care where someone could be exposed to bodily fluids, is a potential risk.\n \n \n Notice the last three are not even sexually related, but are still concidered risk factors. \n \n So, really the only way to be completely 100% sure is to not come in any contact with other humans or animals whatsoever. Might as well just live in a bubble. Even then you can't be sure because the veggies you will eat may have been bled on or been near enough to animials copulating to carry potential risk factors.
