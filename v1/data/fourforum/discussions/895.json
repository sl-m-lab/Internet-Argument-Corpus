   "http://codepink-alert.org/britt.htm\n \n 1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism -- Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n \n 2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights -- Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need\". The people tend to 'look the other way' or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n \n 3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause -- The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.. \n \n 4. Supremacy of the Military -- Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.. \n \n 5. Rampant Sexism -- The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.\n \n 6. Controlled Mass Media -- Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or through sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in wartime, is very common.\n \n 7. Obsession with National Security -- Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n \n 8. Religion and Government are Intertwined -- Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions. \n \n 9. Corporate Power is Protected -- The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n \n 10. Labor Power is Suppressed -- Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely or are severely suppressed.\n \n 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts -- Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\n \n 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment -- Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses, and even forego civil liberties, in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n \n 13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption -- Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions, and who use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n \n 14. Fraudulent Elections -- Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against (or even the assassination of) opposition candidates, the use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and the manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\n Laurence Britt's novel, June 2004 depicts a future America dominated by right-wing extremists.",

   "We're calling the US a facist nation, aren't we. This will be fun. I've already had this argument with someone else. :)\n \n 1. :-/ Americans have always been patriots. Who cares if Europe isn't like that? I don't think they have too much to be proud of. \n \n 2. Uh... what? Don't see how this fits into... anything.\n \n 3. Again... huh?\n \n 4. Our military budget hasn't really changed very much from under Clinton... :-\\\n \n 5. That one is just absurd. The Bush government is one of the most diverse we've seen... \n \n 6. Media isn't be controlled.\n \n 7. Motivation for what?\n \n 8. Bush is a religious man. Get over it.\n \n 9. Why don't you go down to the SEC and talk about the new regulations in effect after Enron, Worldcom, etc? (Which did occur during the Clinton years, by the way. It just came out under Bush)\n \n 10. Labor power isn't being supressed.\n \n 11. I think that one is another absurd one.\n \n 12. Uh... what?\n \n 13. You... think... Bush... is... CORRUPT? Where were you when Clinton was in office? He must have had 50 gates and then there were all those illegal campaign contributions... which the Reno justice department refused to investigate.\n \n 14. Nothing was fraudulent in our elections. The Supreme Court in our system had every right to do what it did... if that recount continued we wouldn't have had a president-elect ready by January. Also, Democratic candidacy boards were using unfair counting tactics to tip the scales. I get very angry when I watch them declare ballots \"Democratic voting pattern\" because the first vote was for a Democrat. Every indepent recount I have seen has Bush ahead by 300- 1500 votes. He won, get over it.",

   "OK, first of all, both sides are overreacting I think. Some points are right, and some aren't.\n \n I'm just going to address a few though.\n \n #9. Fun Fact: the \"reform\" of accounting laws that allowed Enron/Worldcom to happen in the first place was done by, you guessed it (no you didn't), Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-CT). I never liked him.\n \n 13. The most corrupt presidency in recent memory is neither Bush nor Clinton, but Reagon. Clinton's administration had 1 felony conviction, Reagon had 30 (and you know my opinion on the relative moral weight of lying about adultry vs. lying about selling weapons to terrorists). Clinton had his moral issues, but so does Bush. The Halliburton no-bid awarding, the Uranium scandal, John Ashcroft's every other move. bottom line, every politician sucks :)\n \n 14. 1) the supreme court was dead wrong. democracy doesn't have a time limit. If I took an entire state's ballot boxes hostage (with the heavily armed militia I keep in my backyard :) ), and hang on until January, do we just disenfranchise that state? No, I would say that we value democracy more than that. but I suppose Antonin \"there is no right to vote\" Scalia disagrees. 2) I firmly believe, (and the newspaper recounting reports supports this) that more people, in the state of Florida, walked out of that ballot box BELIEVING they had voted for Al Gore. Whether or not Gore's chose recount process would have revealed that, I dont know (im doubtful). But from the reports I've seen and read, I am not doubtful of that fact. 3) the PROCESS in Florida was slanted and inconsistant. Basically, there should have been one of two scenarios. 1) We use a strict standard that only ballots which actually meet the stringent state requirements are counted. No \"hanging chads\" no \"voter intent.\" RESULT: illegitimately modified absentee/military ballots on the panhandle are thrown out, Gore wins (they were more than enough to make up the gap, even w.out the other recounts). 2) We use a loose standard, trying to find voter intent. RESULT: Gore wins again. net 20,000 vote gain from Lake county alone via overvotes gives him the victory. (the ballots were clearly for Gore. The voters often marked \"Gore\" on the box, then wrote \"Gore\" again on the line \"Write candiate's name here\" which was intended for write in candidates, but which many voters apparently thought was a fail-safe mechanism. Unfortuantely, the process went \"loose\" for the military ballots (which favored Bush) and \"strict\" for the overvotes (which favored Gore).",

   "Oh boy where to start...\n \n 1. Oh no not FLAGS! I mean all those flags that people hang everywhere...the government FORCED them to do it!\n \n 2. What \"rights\" has the government forced YOU to give up lately? Last I heard, I was still able to have a gun, own property, get a job, and everything else. Oh wait they checked my bags at the airport...I feel so violated.\n \n 3. I literally laughed out loud when I saw the word liberals on this list...yes yes you poor oppressed liberals...\n \n 4. Since when have we identified any ethnic or religious minority as an enemy? Do you not consider a terrorist organization worthy of being called an enemy?\n \n 5. America's government is more diverse gender wise than most other countries. And besides, the average female-male pay ratio in America is 81%, making us second only to France and Austrailia, who are 82% and 90% respectively. Not what I would call rampant sexism. And it has always amazed me that for people who seem so pressed for the preservation of human rights support the biggest infringement of it: legalized murder in the form of abortion. \n \n 6. Lets see how many countries there are where you can go on tv and publlicly speak out against the government without getting shot. Here's a clue: not many.\n \n 7. This is more like the media being a bunch of greedy fools who will do anything for ratings.\n \n 8. Separation of church and state has increased over the past years.\n \n 9. See above posts. \n \n 10. I have yet to see the suppression of labor unions.\n \n 11. Tell me, why should millions of dollars of taxpayers money be wasted for someone to fling a bunch of paint onto a canvas and call it \"art\"? Your stupid precious liberal arts aren't \"attacked,\" the government just refuses to waste money on it. Here's an idea: FIND OTHER WAYS TO FUND IT.\n \n 12. Police are given just enough power to do their job. Oh yeah, and please tell me when that \"national police force\" shows up at your house for one of those random searches they are so notorious for.\n \n 13. Only conservatives are corrupt. Of course.\n \n 14. Obviously, you shouldn't even bother voting next time. emoticon_rolleyes",

My mistake. And I'm guessing this is the clause from the act you are talking about<b></b>:\n \n \"Section 213 would take an extremely limited authority and expand it so that it would be available in any kind of search (physical or electronic) and in any kind of criminal case. The standard that law enforcement must show - that an investigation will be jeopardized - is a very low one. Law enforcement agents will seek to delay notification whenever it is to their advantage to do so. Over time, the delayed notice \"exception\" would become the rule and would deal another serious blow to the privacy protections afforded by the Fourth Amendment.\"~http://archive.aclu.org/congress/l102301b.html\n \n This does seem to be an infringement on the 4th amendment...hopefully the supreme court would rule against it?",
