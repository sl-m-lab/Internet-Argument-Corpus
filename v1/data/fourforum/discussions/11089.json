   "When I was listening to Sally kerns words they sounded very familiar. I then remembered who spoke similiar words. For all of you who think I am crazy for comparing rebulicans to nazis I give you the following.\n \n Hitler\n \n\n Speech delivered by Hitler in Salzburg, 7 or 8 August 1920. (NSDAP meeting)\n \n The following quotation is from a shorthand transcript.\n \n \"This is the first demand we must raise and do [reversal of the Versailles Treaty provisions]: that our people be set free, that these chains be burst asunder, that Germany be once again captain of her soul and master of her destinies, together with all those who want to join Germany. (Applause)\n \n And the fulfillment of this first demand will then open up the way for all the other reforms. And here is one thing that perhaps distinguishes us from you [Austrians] as far as our programme is concerned, although it is very much in the spirit of things: our attitude to the Jewish problem.\n \n For us, this is not a problem you can turn a blind eye to-one to be solved by small concessions. For us, it is a problem of whether our nation can ever recover its health, whether the Jewish spirit can ever really be eradicated. Don't be misled into thinking you can fight a disease without killing the carrier, without destroying the bacillus. Don't think you can fight racial tuberculosis without taking care to rid the nation of the carrier of that racial tuberculosis. This Jewish contamination will not subside, this poisoning of the nation will not end, until the carrier himself, the Jew, has been banished from our midst. (Applause)\n\n \n \n Sally Kern\n \nOne of my colleagues said We don&#8217;t have a gay problem in our community&#8230; well you know what, that is so dumb. If you have cancer in your little toe, do you just say that I&#8217;m going to forget about it since the rest of you is fine? It spreads! This stuff is deadly and it is spreading. It will destroy our young people and it will destroy this nation.\n\n \n Although Kern has not called for the exterimination of gays, yet, her type of thinking is where it begins. She is not alone her view of gays is systemic within the republican party. \n \n From Lott to Huckabee to Santorum they have all made anti gay statements.",

   "&#8220;Studies show no society that has totally embraced homosexuality has lasted more than a few decades. It is not a lifestyle that is good for this nation. We're not teaching facts and knowledge anymore. We're teaching indoctrination. They are going after our young children, as young as two years of age, to try to teach them that the homosexual lifestyle is an acceptable lifestyle. This stuff is deadly and it's spreading and it will destroy our young people, it will destroy this nation.\" Sally Kern (OK)\n \n &#8220;My advice to the gay community is SHUT UP, just don&#8217;t talk about it. If you walk around talking about what you do in the bedroom, you should be on the pervert channel.&#8221; Gary George (OR)\n \n &#8220;The gay community has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country, and they wield extreme power ... That agenda is the greatest threat to our freedom that we face today. Why do you think we see the rationalization for abortion and multiple sexual partners? That's a gay agenda.\" Tom Coburn (OK)\n \n &#8220;I believe that when you&#8217;re in a cultural war like this, you have to respond with equal and hopefully greater force if you want to win this battle. But this battle is the most important issue that we face today, and what an honor it has been to serve in the United States Congress and carry the Marriage Amendment.&#8221; Marilyn Musgrave (CO)\n \n &#8220;My cousin died of AIDS; he was XXXXX as a three-dollar bill. He had that homosexual lifestyle and deserved what he got.\" D. Alan Hays (FL)\n \n &#8220;It is [a sin]....You should try to show them a way to deal with that problem, just like alcohol...or sex addiction...or kleptomaniacs&#8221; Trent Lott (TX)\n \n &#8220;I think homosexuality is a lifestyle, it&#8217;s a choice, and that lifestyle can be changed. I think it is a transgression against God&#8217;s law, God&#8217;s will. The reality is, again, &#8230; that I think we make choices all the time. And I think you make good choices and bad choices in terms of lifestyle. Our expectation is that one&#8217;s genetic makeup might make one more inclined to be an arsonist, or might make one more inclined to be a kleptomaniac. Do I think that they can be changed? Yes.&#8221; Ken Blackwell (OH)\n \n &#8220;One might have that lifestyle, but if one promotes it as acceptable behavior&#8230; I don&#8217;t think they should be a representative of this country.&#8221; Don Nickles (OK)\n \n &#8220;These people are intellectually dishonest in just about everything they do or say.... They start by pretending that it is just another form of love. It's sickening.&#8221; Jesse Helms (NC)\n \n \"Hitler and his supporters were Satanists and homosexuals. That's just a true statement... The notion that is involved in homosexuality, the unbridled sort of satisfaction of human passions, leads to totalitarianism, Nazism, and communism. \" Alan Keyes, Republican Presidential candidate\n \n \"You look at the social impact of the countries that have engaged in homosexual marriage. You'll know 'em by their fruits,\" Sam Brownback (KS)\n \n &#8220;I think the radical view is to say that we&#8217;re going to change the definition of marriage so that it can mean two men, two women, a man and three women, a man and a child, a man and animal.&#8221; Mike Huckabee (Gov, ARK)\n \n &#8220;In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be.\" Rick Santorum (PA)\n \n Posters are invited to list correspondingly ignorant/bigoted quotes from the other side of the aisle... if you can find them.",
