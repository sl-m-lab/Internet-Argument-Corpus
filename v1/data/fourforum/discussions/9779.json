A person cannot have a belief system, it may only have a belief. I'll explain.\n A system is an arrangement (pattern, design) of parts which interact with each other within the system's boundaries (form, structure, organization) to function as a whole. Applying this definition to a religios system, e.g. buddism, christianity, islam, hindu ect., a person cannot have a belief system, because you as a teist are part of the organised religion (system) and therefore as an individual, you lack the third element of the definition - organization. You as a person can only posses a form (material side of belief) and structure (interconnection and interdependecy of outside - meaning you are not the creator of your own belief because the structure came from whoever introdused to you your belief -, given beliefs within your faith, this beeing its formal side). A person may only have a belief. \n And the subject of these dabates are always about one's (religious) beliefs, not how his or hers faith is organised.

That's more or less the approach of a systems analyst.\n \n Although Inyx seems to hold that sets of beliefs are \"systems\", I agree with his point that individuals don't build a unique belief system but they are initiated into a pre-existing set of beliefs. (This is the function of baptism in the Christian religion). \n \n Religions, it seems to me, are not systematically organized sets of beliefs. They are mutable accretions of scriptures, doctrines, ceremonies, etc. which are or can be subjected to inconsistent modification over many centuries. \n \nWell, even the insane have a world view.\n Everyone has a belief system. Many may not even be aware of it. I have been told by a few that they have no belief system.

It would resemble the kind of knowledge chemists have of chemistry except, that it would be about everything.\n \n What people exalt as their worldviews are really just views, which is to say, a collection of opinions. Now it is true that everyone has a lot of those. But if we look carefully at the whole catalogue of our opinions, we find most of them to be neither systematic nor theoretically supported. In most cases they are just a patchwork of persuasions that have been contrived from what we were taught at home, at school, or garnered from conversations and experiences, enlivened, perhaps, with a few luminous insights derived from careful study or from our own chance discoveries. \n \n James.",

   "Inyx\n \n Okay, at first I was mixing them, now I'm using one of them incorrectly. All of this without writing a word. All of this occurring in your mind.\n \n \nInyx You have used the term belief system - there was your mistake. A person cannot have a belief system, it may only have a belief. I'll explain.\n A system is an arrangement (pattern, design) of parts which interact with each other within the system's boundaries (form, structure, organization) to function as a whole. Applying this definition to a religios system, e.g. buddism, christianity, islam, hindu ect., a person cannot have a belief system, because you as a teist are part of the organised religion (system) and therefore as an individual,\nThis is not a universally true statement. \n I can be a Theist and not associate myself with any structured religions (Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hindu, etc). \n \n The Dewey decimal system is, I would think you would agree, a system.\n A young student might ask a librarian, \"How can I ever find the book I want?\"\n And the librarian might reply \"We have a system. I will teach it to you and then you will have a system to find any book in the library.\" \n \n \nInyx you lack the third element of the definition - organization. You as a person can only posses a form (material side of belief) and structure (interconnection and interdependecy of outside - meaning you are not the creator of your own belief because the structure came from whoever introdused to you your belief - given beliefs within your faith, this beeing its formal side),\nWell a person can develop a belief system on their own, without interference. The \"wolf child\" extremes are examples of this. They have a belief system that that says they are part of the wolf pack. Maybe you believe that wolves have belief systems, and they did they introducing/teaching.\n \n \n A person may only have a belief.\n\n I have a system for using eggs. I use the old ones first.\n I have a system for writing. I start on the left, and move towards the right.\n I have lots of systems. \n \n \n ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n \n \nJames I think in order to show that a set of beliefs is a systematic entity, you would have to explain the principles on which the system is organized and that it contains no contradictions. That's more or less the approach of a systems analyst.\nSo there are no imperfect systems? No system has a contradiction? There might be a (supposed) system, but someone finds a contradiction, and it ceases to be a system?\n \n We also have a problem with \"have to explain the principles on which the system is organized\". I take this to mean simply (for example) \"My belief system is: for BHN to gain as much wealth and power as humanly possible before he dies.\", and from there all else follows, all of the details so to speak. I sense you see a need to sharply define all of the details.\n \n There are many uses for the term \"system\". We may need to pick a common one.\n The first one from my Encarta is: \"Complex body; a combination of related elements organized into a complex whole.\" \n The second one from my Encarta says: \"A set of principles; a scheme of ideas or principles, for example, for classification or for forms of government or religion.\"\n \n Your idea of \"no contradictions\" is not pointed out in either of these.\n From the first one we can infer \"no contradictions\", by saying \"whole\" means no contradictions. By this definition, we might say an orange is a system. Related elements are organized into a complex whole orange. Peeling, pith, seeds, juice, all organized into a whole orange. If there is no peeling, this is a contradiction to the meaning of an orange, it is not a whole orange, so there is no system.\n \n From the second, I can't seem to find the idea of no contradictions.\n The third definition just throws the gate open: \"way of proceeding; a method of procedures for achieving something\". We see very few constraints on the use of the word system.\n \n I use the dictionary definitions not that you might choose one, but to show that the word has various meanings. Actually we are using \"system\" as a term, with a specific meaning, especially in association with \"belief, as in \"belief system\". And we seem to be in disagreement about the meaning.\n You mention \"system analyst\" as a foundation for the meaning of \"system\".\n Do these system analysts analyze all types of systems, or just particular ones?\n If they do not analyze \"belief systems\", then you may be using the incorrect term of system analyst, to come to a meaning of belief system.\n \n When we attach the word \"belief\" to \"system\", we are creating a term (belief system) which should have very a relatively specific meaning, possibly slightly different from the other common usages of the two individuals words. \n \n \n \n Although Inyx seems to hold that sets of beliefs are \"systems\", I agree with his point that individuals don't build a unique belief system but they are initiated into a pre-existing set of beliefs. (This is the function of baptism in the Christian religion).\n Well I can't say this is not sometimes true, but I can say it is not necessary. I would actually go so far as to say normally a person does build their own unique belief system, using a shared system, such as Christian Baptist. \n \n The Christian Baptist belief system may be one unified whole, its members are not.\n \n Within the group there are many differences in beliefs concerning the details.\n \n I have belonged to many church groups where I hear something unusual from a prominent church member, and I will ask a friend \"Do you believe that?\". The reply will be something like \"Well, some people do, I don't really\".\n \n Within the various sects of Christianity evolution can be a key element of their belief system (saying it is not true, only creationist views are true), and for others in the same sect, evolution is not important. God did it, end of story. \n The older the church the more we see these divergences of beliefs. The Catholic church being the best example.\n Some people would say one has to believe certain things to belong to the Catholic church, and I would agree, but would add that many of the details are left to the individual believer.\n \n I have long noticed that individuals seeking a belief system will find one that suits them. This can be as simple as adopting the same one as their parents.\n They will then tailor the details, to their particular flavor. (Yes I want a cherry sundae, but I want walnuts on mine instead of crushed peanuts.) \n \n \n Religions, it seems to me, are not systematically organized sets of beliefs. They are mutable accretions of scriptures, doctrines, ceremonies, etc. which are or can be subjected to inconsistent modification over many centuries.\nIs the theory of evolution a system? Certainly it is mutable.\n And the Dewey decimal system, never any modifications?\n \n Isn't a language a system? It is certainly not stagnant.\n Isn't mathematics a system? Haven't there been changes and modifications over the centuries? Wasn't calculus a modification to the mathematical system?\n \n Are none of these \"systems\"?\n \n \n \n A worldview, if anybody really had one, would be a system of interdependent, grounded beliefs, with solid theoretical underpinning. It would resemble the kind of knowledge chemists have of chemistry except, that it would be about everything.\nWell, this is a philosophy thread. If this were a scientific thread, I might agree with you.\n \n Your use of the word/term \"worldview\" is not the same as commonly accepted in philosophy.\n \n Again referring to Encarta as a starting point for the meaning of \"worldview\": \"view of all life; a comprehensive interpretation or image of the universe and humanity.\" \n \n You want to put some qualifier on it, saying it must have \"solid theoretical underpinning\", without explaining what this means. A belief in angels has a solid theoretical unpinning, if you are a Christian. If you are a naturalist, there is no solid theoretical underpinning.\n I would argue that this solid theoretical underpinning, comes from within the belief system itself. Worldviews are, ultimately, self-supporting.\n \n The worldview of Naturalism has a basic tenant that there are no supernatural beings or power. It arrived at this point by accepting some evidence, and rejecting other as unconvincing. The yardstick it used came from within the belief system itself. From here it takes no great reasoning to see that naturalism has a solid theoretical underpinning against angels. The belief system came first, the solid theoretical underpinning followed.\n \n Your worldview will determine what is acceptable as a solid theoretical underpinning.\n \n \nWhat people exalt as their worldviews are really just views, which is to say, a collection of opinions. Now it is true that everyone has a lot of those. But if we look carefully at the whole catalogue of our opinions, we find most of them to be neither systematic nor theoretically supported. In most cases they are just a patchwork of persuasions that have been contrived from what we were taught at home, at school, or garnered from conversations and experiences, enlivened, perhaps, with a few luminous insights derived from careful study or from our own chance discoveries.\n\"Worldview\" is a philosophical (or psychological) term, but you want to use it in a scientific sense. This of course comes from your worldview.\n In the philosophical sense, a worldview is \"a patchwork of persuasions that have been contrived from what we were taught at home, at school, or garnered from conversations and experiences, enlivened, perhaps, with a few luminous insights derived from careful study or from our own chance discoveries\", and refined according to the individual.\n \n If you can find a reference from a philosophical or psychological source that says most individuals do not have a worldview, it would help support your position.\n \n Otherwise, it is apples and oranges.",

   "\n The Dewey decimal system is, I would think you would agree, a system.\n\n Generalising about the nature of systems, you cite the Dewey Decimal System as an example: as you know, this is a numerical classification system that is internally consistent - it has to be, otherwise you'd never the unique book in the library that you're looking for. I wouldn't say it could never be modified. In a sense it is continuously modified as new fields of inquiry are opened up and books are written about them.\n \nSo there are no imperfect systems? No system has a contradiction? There might be a (supposed) system, but someone finds a contradiction, and it ceases to be a system?\n\n A system with contradictions (internal inconsistencies) wouldn't work. If you had a system for locating electrical faults in a car, would you ever succeed on the basis that contradictory methods were employed? \n \nWe also have a problem with \"have to explain the principles on which the system is organized\". I take this to mean simply (for example) \"My belief system is: for BHN to gain as much wealth and power as humanly possible before he dies.\", and from there all else follows, all of the details so to speak. I sense you see a need to sharply define all of the details.\n\n If it were your goal in life to acquire wealth and power, you wouldn't need a \"belief system\" to explain it. Your acquisitive tendencies are likely to result from an emotional drive that isn't under rational control. The behaviour of misers and gangsters can be explained in this way.\n \nWhen we attach the word \"belief\" to \"system\", we are creating a term (belief system) which should have very a relatively specific meaning, possibly slightly different from the other common usages of the two individuals words. \n\n I still don't think you've made a case for distinguishing a belief system from a mere set of opinions that are acquired and/or discarded piecemeal. And among this set they will be many false opinions. But false opinions do not open a window on the world, or anything else. They lead nowhere and reveal nothing.\n \nIsn't a language a system? It is certainly not stagnant.\n Isn't mathematics a system? Haven't there been changes and modifications over the centuries? Wasn't calculus a modification to the mathematical system?\n Are none of these \"systems\"? \n\n I'm not arguing that systems don't exist. But would it make sense to say, allowing for complete ignorance, that the principles of mathematics are part of your belief system and not part of mine? Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the finding and properties of derivatives and integrals of functions among other things. It is independent of any belief system. \n \nYour use of the word/term \"worldview\" is not the same as commonly accepted in philosophy.\n \n A \"Worldview\" is a philosophical (or psychological) term, but you want to use it in a scientific sense. This of course comes from your worldview.\n In the philosophical sense, a worldview is \"a patchwork of persuasions that have been contrived from what we were taught at home, at school, or garnered from conversations and experiences, enlivened, perhaps, with a few luminous insights derived from careful study or from our own chance discoveries\", and refined according to the individual.\n \n If you can find a reference from a philosophical or psychological source that says most individuals do not have a worldview, it would help support your position.\n \n Otherwise, it is apples and oranges.\n\n If a world view precedes theoretical underpinning (i.e. determines what is acceptable as such), then at some point it must be nothing more than a propensity to think in a particular way. Now the world is the whole of reality, so a view of it would be a systematic survey of reality, in all its infinite complexity. Is a comprehensive view like this possible? \n \n Many Christian apologists today are calling their faith a worldview. I've done it myself. But there are two good reasons not to speak this way. In the first place Christian doctrine, vast though it is, has little or nothing to say about many matters. It is silent, for example, about quantum mechanics, the art of origami, and the rules of 5 card stud. Though a religious faith may play an indispensable part in understanding the world, on its own it does not furnish anything like a complete understanding of it (and was never intended to be a substitute for the rational inquiry that understanding any aspect of the world involves). So if it were trying to be a worldview, in the proper sense of that term, Christianity would have to be called incomplete and defective. My guess is that the other major faiths, of which I know little, would not fare any better.\n \n I haven't consulted Encarta (or any other encyclopaedia). I'm testing my opinions in a spirit of free inquiry. In other words, I'm ready to amend my views if they prove untenable. \n \n James.",

   "No belief system can ever be proved. Your viiw of what is most realsonable is as valid as anyone else's At the moment the hot debate is over materialism vs. non materialism.\n \n Materialism in this context is not about an obsession with money. Nor is it about the existence or non existence of God. It concerns a definition of reality. Materialists see the universe, including living organisms, as consisting of nothing more than purposeless matter in motion -- a complex machine lacking any intelligence or volition. We non materialists see subjective choice (free will) and intelligent causation (intelligent design) as non supernatural aspects of reality. Only a committed materialist would question the reality of free will in humans and other mammals. However some materialist do just that, claiming that free will is an illusion, that what we mistake for rational free choice is nothing more than mechanical, deterministic interactions of the brain.\n \n \n Many materialists are atheists, and many non materialists are religious, attributing everything to God. However theism is not the only alternative to materialism. Panpsychism, for instance, proposes that free-will, subjective choice, has always been a basic ingredient of reality. The \"laws\" of nature are merely entrenched habits of a spontaneous, volitional, creative reality. \"Laws\" concerning inanimate matter are habits so entrenched that deviations cannot be detected by existing measuring methods (except perhaps at the quantum level). Living organisms, on the other hand, all retain some limited ability to respond creatively and purposefully. Living organisms can be easily observed overriding habits, instincts and \"laws\" of nature, The universe is an intelligent democracy in the process of designing itself. The \"design\" of inanimate matter may be pretty entrenched by this time, but living organisms are still to some extent a design in process. \n \n At the moment the materialists seem to be in control of academia, and they are not shy about wielding their power to silence non materialistic views. They harass and deny tenure to scientists who question materialism. Some materialists go so far as to claim materialism is the only permissible \"scientific\" view of reality, and they have persuaded a court to prohibit theories involving free will and intelligent causation from being considered in biology classrooms. I doubt an overwhelming majority of the public would define themselves as materialists if they gave the matter serious consideration. In any case, I'm confident that only a few in our society are so intolerant as to condone banning conflicting views from consideration. \n \n Freud, Marx and Darwin have often been named as the three materialists of the 20th Century. Marxism is in decline. Darwinism is being hotly debated. Freud suggested that our thoughts were a mechanical process, over which we have little control. Few people still accept the Freudian notion that faulty parenting cause autism, mental illness or homosexuality. However some people still argue that 'thinking' is nothing more than mechanical brain interactions and chemical reactions.\n \n I'd love to have you join me at my web site where I explore such questions, but apparently I have to do 10 posts before I'm allowed to post link. Hopefully this will count as number 1.\n \n Berthajane Vandegrift",

As I recall, most religions have several key characteristics or traits that define their Gods. \n \n \nwhat leprechauns, unicorns, the flying spaghetti monster, magical space monkeys and living care bears have in common is that they are defined so that they can be identified by the unique qualities based on these definitions. so statements concerning these things can be logically verified, because the \"y\" of these statements can be compared to the \"x\" logically\n\n \n So how do we prove the existence of those? \n \n \nwhat was interesting was that such a being exists, so the existence of god per this definition was proven. however, believers were disgruntled that the definition was too limiting so that proof was thrown out the window and we were back to square one\n\n \n Come again? How can we prove that a omnipotent God exists? \n \n \nproving god's existence is both simple and difficult. its as simple as coming up with a definition of god that everyone can agree on. and its as difficult as coming up with a definition of god that everyone can agree on\n\n \n Screw everyone. Can we prove that the Hindu Gods exist?",

   "What do you mean by characteristics or traits? As I recall, most religions have several key characteristics or traits that define their Gods. \n\n actually, thats not true. ask 100 people to define god and youre likely to get 100 definitions, maybe more. most definitions are so vague and abstract that they are useless for any logical use. for example, omnipotent is a popular trait of god, but ask one what they mean by omnipotent, and it usually boils down from anything imaginable to anything possible. if an omnipotent god can only do what is possible, then god cannot travel faster than the speed of light, for example, because doing that is impossible. obviously, believers would object, so the definition would have to be revised. eventually youll find that there is no concise and conclusive definition of god\n \n \nSo how do we prove the existence of those? \n\n pick one, give of link to the definition, and i'll prove it for you\n \n \nCome again? How can we prove that a omnipotent God exists? \n\n if we could settle on what \"omnipotent god\" is defined as, then yes, we could\n \n \nScrew everyone. Can we prove that the Hindu Gods exist?\n\n sure! do you have a handy definition of a hindu god i could work with?\n \n \nThat which does not exist cannot be proven to exist.\n\n correct. you can only prove the existence of things that already exist. however, you can only determine the existence of something if it can be physically or at least conceptually identified, and you can only PROVE such existence if you can articulate these characteristics and concepts to others. thats why the definition is critical to the proof",
