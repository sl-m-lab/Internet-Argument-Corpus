   "I could have told anyone this just by looking around. There are jobs aplenty and the income is rising. The fact that we haven't gone hog wild is a good thing. This portends the likelihood that our economic upswing will continue longer without the need for significant corrections. Now compare these figures with France or Germany with their heavily socialized economies. The numbers tell the tale.\n =============================\n \n The New York Times\n \n Creation of Jobs Surged in April, and Income Rose\n \n By LOUIS UCHITELLE\n Published: May 7, 2005\n \n Overriding earlier evidence that suggested the economy was slowing significantly, job creation and income growth appear to be holding up their end of the recovery.\n Frank Franklin II/Associated Press\n \n The government reported yesterday that the nation's employers generated an unexpectedly large number of jobs in April - 274,000 - even as they gave their existing employees additional hours of work.\n \n The employment report was the most positive news about the economy in weeks. It dented the gloom that had accumulated after a number of recent measures provided evidence that last year's robust growth might be fading.\n \n \"The main thing I think these employment numbers tell you is that all this worry about the economy experiencing a significant soft patch has been exaggerated,\" said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at the Prudential Equity Group.\n \n Employment rose across all sectors except manufacturing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised its estimates for February and March, adding 93,000 jobs - enough to erase the impression that job growth had faltered, particularly in March.\n \n The unemployment rate last month was 5.2 percent, unchanged from March but well below the 6.3 percent rate of nearly two years ago.\n \n The Bush administration greeted the April jobs report as a sign of better times ahead. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said in a statement that the surge in job creation showed that \"President Bush's jobs and growth agenda has again produced results for Americans.\"\n \n For the broad group of workers below management ranks, hourly wages were up 5 cents, to $16 an hour, and up 2.7 percent over the last year...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/07/business/07econ.html?",

Then why is it that when opec increased production, the price did not go down? They are producing a surplus of oil right now. Many refineries have quite buying it because their storage tanks are not only full, but the next shipment is already bought and paid for. There is plenty of oil ont he market currently.\n \n Also, if this was merely a question of supply and emoand, worldwide prices would have gone up regardless of the currency used.

The price of goods will only rise once producers, having witnessed the low rate of profit, reduce the supply.\n\n \n But in this instance (the oil price explosion) the price is complicated by lack of refining capacity. We haven't built a new refinery in 30 years. The Saudis are perfectly willing to sell us more oil (around 2 million more barrels a day) but we have no way to refine it. We are now having to import the finished product (gasoline) which is much more expensive than crude. Incidentally, according to the Saudi oil minister there is no shortage of oil and they have about 280 billion barrels of proven reserves with another 200 billion barrels essentially proven. He indicated this would last about 200 years. The bottom line is that we have more demand than product. That almost always raises prices, as it should. I can remember when gasoline sold for 15.9 cents per gallon in 1971. Gasoline was dirt cheap. There was more supply than demand and they used to give away free glassware when we filled our tanks. As I recall, we use about 20 million barrels a day in the U.S. If we were somehow able to only use 10 million barrels a day it would have an immediate and drastic change downward in the price of gasoline. OPEC, of course, would attempt to reduce production but that would be unwieldy and not happen overnight and meanwhile the gasoline terminals and tanks would be overflowing with gasoline and they would be attempting mightily to unload it.

   "Is it not passing strange that the Chinese have resisted revaluing their Yuan upwards as it has been pegged against the dollar for years. Why would they be so willing to accept these allegedly worthless dollars for their goods if it didn't make economic sense. And perhaps you have not heard that the Chinese have been scouring the world for oil supply to fuel their economy. Think SUPPLY AND DEMAND. When you master that concept we can talk about this as learned adults.\n\n \n Resisted? Think \"looking for the opportun moment\" The chinese ar holding a HUGE stack of our debt. They unpeg the yuan, and the dollar dropps ;like a rock. The japanese are currently doing all they can to prop up the dollar because in doing so, they keep the yuan high. \n \n The chinese have already announced they are going to unpeg the yuan, nad it will end up a fully convertible currency. They do not want to see the dollar fall though the floor while they are not only holding massive US debt, but also have dollars as part of their reserve currency. Tehy are selling off dollars as a reserve currnecy, over 80% of their reserves that were once dollars are now euros. You can not grab up fistfulls of any given currency like that without drivign the price through the roof unless you do it slowly. \n \n We can expect the chinese to unpeg thwe yuan, and the value of the yuan to shoot up opvernight. We can also expect them to immeditly dump several trillion in yuan on the market the same day or week.

Are you thinking of the ECU (XCU)? \n \n \n \n Yes, in time, which is why until recently there were XXXXXX running around this board going \"inflation? What inflation?\" This year we will almost certianly see massive increases in the CPI, which is how domestic inflaiton is essentially measured. We could fill several pages with why it takes time to filter to the CPI, but based on the fact that you can't grasp even the most basic economic concepts, you will have to find somebody else to explain that one.\n \n \n \n Really? Then why is it that when opec increased production, the price did not go down? They are producing a surplus of oil right now. Many refineries have quite buying it because their storage tanks are not only full, but the next shipment is already bought and paid for. There is plenty of oil ont he market currently.\n \n Also, if this was merely a question of supply and emoand, worldwide prices would have gone up regardless of the currency used. I showed as clearly as I know how above. Those are not numbers I pulled out of my butt. Those are the REAL numbers. Look them up if you like (and you can figure out how...since you apparently do not know how to look up public financials on a company that you own stock in). \n \n If this was a question of supply and demand, prices would be up worldwide regardless of exchange rate. This is clearly not the case.\n \n This is also why naitons have not changed their outlook and are still pegging oil at $35 per barrel. Adjust for inflation, and their cost is still comparable to $35 per barrel in 2000 dollars. \n \n Why do you bother posting on economic issues? Are you just a troll who posts things to see others smack you down? Come on, you can tell me.\n\n \n Frankly, I'm fed up with your nonsense. I feel like I am casting pearls before swine.

Eventually, water seeks it own levels, and the Euro appreciated to the current level as it has become clear that it is has real value. \n \n And this doesn't even begin to touch on the fact that gasoline is selling for $6.74 in Norway (an oil producing nation) and I'm currently paying $1.85 for gasoline here where I live. AND, AND, AND, the price the gasoline, adjusted for inflation today is about $1.00 less per gallon than it was in 1981, the all-time high water mark for the cost of gasoline in the United States.

Would anyone (anyone?) like to argue that we have had an inflation of 67% since that time? I'm sure that daewoo will concoct some new math to prove his point but no other rational person can. Would I be wrong?\n \n BTW, make note of the fact that in 1981 the price of crude was $38.34 per barrel. That was in fact about the time of the all-time high water mark for gasoline prices within the U.S. at an inflation adjusted $2.90 per gallon. (remember I'm now paying $1.85 per gallon.) In July, 1986 it was selling at $11.38 per gallon (and I paid about 59.9 cents per gallon). Therefore if one adheres to daewoo's imaginative new math we must have had a DEFLATION of about 70% in that five year period. That's nonsense to believe that. No normal person with two working brain cells could claim such reality. But one must believe this in order to fit daewoo's new math which states that the price of crude is a product of inflation/deflation.",

I'll never argue with real numbers. In point of fact the value of the dollar has declined but I was attempting to explain for the benefit of our economically challenged that a wild statement that \"inflation accounts for the increase in the price of crude\" is utter nonsense. At the very least, it makes up only a tiny percentage of the increased price of crude. This is not the reason that the price of gasoline has increased in the U.S. within the past few months. It is almost entirely due to the proven relationship of supply and demand. Daewoo goes off on this side street talking about the difference between gasoline and crude but it is a diversion from the truth. The price of gasoline is tied to the price of crude. But it is also complicated by several other factors; namely lack of refinining capacity; increased summer travel in the U.S.; a booming economy that inevitably increases demand; oil future's speculation; and last, but not least the propensity of oil companies to maximize their profits during these times. They have reported all-time high profits. To further prove my point, let me posit the following.

In point of fact the value of the dollar has declined but I was attempting to explain for the benefit of our economically challenged that a wild statement that \"inflation accounts for the increase in the price of crude\" is utter nonsense. At the very least, it makes up only a tiny percentage of the increased price of crude.

The price of gasoline is tied to the price of crude. But it is also complicated by several other factors; namely lack of refinining capacity; increased summer travel in the U.S.; a booming economy that inevitably increases demand; oil future's speculation; and last, but not least the propensity of oil companies to maximize their profits during these times. They have reported all-time high profits. To further prove my point, let me posit the following. We have about 600 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (the salt caverns in the southeast).

Oil is used for virtually everything. \n\n \n As relates to energy costs, gas is hardly even worth mentioning. the bulk energy product that comes form oil is fuel oil (mostly #3) which is used to fuel everything from ships to power plants to grain dryers to smelting furnaces, textile dryers, long run generators, casting furnaces, kilns, ovens, etc..... Less than 5% of our total energy expenditures (national level) are in the form of gasoline. \n \n This is why I get a little confused with MMs insistence to talk gas prices when I said \"energy costs\". Currently, we are producing 1.2 million gallons of gas per month and storing it against the summer driving season. we are producing an additional 2.7 million gallons per month to mix with #5 fuel oil in order to make #3 fuel oil. These are the things that drive up our energy costs, not gas. Consider that 1 cargo ship can burn through 40,000 gallons of #3 or #5 fuel oil in a single month, and consdier the millions of cargo ships, cruise ships, etc... fueling up in US ports every month, and it quickly becomes apparent that gas prices are merely a pittance when one considers energy costs.\n \n As the price of oil rises and taking the cost of petro fuel up with it, companies start looking for alternatives (when you are looking at a long term rise casued by inflation like we are now). Electricy and NG go up, as demand increases. \n \n Oil is an imported good. The massive decline of the dollar in the last decade has increased the relative price of all imported goods. Even japanese goods, have increased in real dollar prices, and they have fought like hell to keep the yen low. That is why we see more and more chinese junk on our store shelves. Teh yuan, being pegged to the dollar, has decreased in value right along with the dollar, even though it should be rising when you consider the strength of the chinese economy.\n \n \n \n it's not inherently buying time.

How can that be since \"inflation\" fuels price increases of crude?\n \n And notice also, that the price of oil is not immune from price pressure either, therefore there is some elasticity even in energy. (For Duo)\n =============================\n \n Oil dives below $50 on plump U.S. stocks\n \n Thursday May 12, 7:39 AM EDT\n \n LONDON (Reuters) - Oil dropped below the $50 threshold on Thursday as a strengthening U.S. dollar extended a heavy fall driven by rising U.S. crude stocks and signs of slowing global demand growth.\n \n U.S. crude fell 65 cents to $49.80 a barrel, deepening a drop of more than $1.60 a barrel, or 3 percent, on Wednesday. Prices are now more than 14 percent below the record-high of $58.28 struck in early April.\n \n London's Brent crude oil dropped 74 cents to $49.33 a barrel, hitting its lowest level since March 1.\n \n Prices fell as the U.S. dollar hit a three-month high against the euro at $1.2741, extending gains made on a narrower U.S. trade deficit and as some investors bet on a strong U.S. retail sales report.\n \n Oil has been reluctant to make a decisive break below $50, because big-money investment funds have viewed any price drop as a buying opportunity. Even so, further gains in the dollar could place more downward pressure on oil, traders said.\n \n \"It depends largely on what the U.S. dollar does. If the euro weakens to around 1.25, I think the funds will liquidate further length in oil,\" said Tony Machacek of Bache Financial in London.\n \n Falls in the dollar's value this year and last have helped lift oil prices, by insulating non-dollar economies from the impact of higher oil prices. Investment funds have also switched from treasury markets into commodities and energy.\n \n Oil's Wednesday slide came as the U.S. government said heavy imports pushed crude oil stocks in the United States, the world's top energy consumer, to a six-year high last week.\n \n Inventories rose by 2.7 million barrels to 329.7 million -- a tweflth rise in the last 13 weeks and are now 30.3 million barrels higher than year-ago levels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.\n \n SLOWING GROWTH\n \n Sentiment was also dampened by a report from International Energy Agency (IEA) saying that high fuel prices were slowing oil demand growth in key markets China, Europe and the U.S.\n \n First-quarter demand growth in the U.S. slowed to 250,000 bpd, or 1.2 percent, from 340,000 bpd, the IEA said.\n \n China's demand growth slackened to 4.5 percent in the first quarter of this year from 19.3 percent a year ago. The West's energy watchdog trimmed its annual China demand growth projection by 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 470,000 bpd.\n \n \"That would put more pressure on prices, particularly the downward forecast on Chinese demand. China has been the prime driver of global rise in consumption over the past year or so,\" said Daniel Hynes, at ANZ Institutional Banking.\n \n Some said the EIA's report of a mild rise in weekly U.S. gasoline stocks of 200,000 barrels, ahead of the summer driving season, could limit further losses.\n \n \"The key was lower-than-expected production. Refiners are coming back from maintenance significantly more slowly than expected and East Coast refiners look to be having problems maintaining their light product yields,\" Paris-based SG Commodities said in a report.\n \n http://finance.myway.com/ht/nw/bus/20050512/hlm_bus-sp112124.html",

The US dollar therefore, continues to be worth less.\n\n \n Well, actually it has been recently INCREASING in value against the Euro but that isn't the reason that oil prices have varied up and down. Even if the dollar was worth half of what is currently selling for (money is a commodity just like oil), the oil producers would have to suck it up anyway as they can't drink the oil. Take the Chinese demand out of the equation (as has started to happen) and the price of oil would quickly drop to $25 a barrel. For the producers to keep the price of oil at $50 a barrel would be like pushing a string. Even the Saudis have said that they are shooting for a price of about $28 per barrel. Evidently they aren't much concerned about the value of the dollar. Why would they take a worthless currency?\n \n In any event all of this nonsense about the dollar is just more of the same from the crowd that looks for the cloud in a silver linining. 25 years ago \"experts\" were pushing gold at $850 an ounce because our currency was going to be worthless, yada, yada, yada.

Why you continue displaying your lack of knowledge and education is a very curious personality trait.\n\n \n Can we cut the ****? Daewoo said the price increase was the result of inflation. I said that was hogwash and that it was due to supply and demand. If the price of goods and services rises 3% this year the price of oil should likewise increase 3% according to his thinking. If the price of oil was $50 at the beginning of the year it should be at $51.50 at the end of the year give or take a few cents. My statement is that the supply and demand is what is influencing the price of oil. That is to say, if the supply of crude from OPEC were to increase from its approximate 28 million barrels a day to 56 million barrels a day that the price would decline substantially, perhaps even collapse to less than $20 or even $10 a barrel if the supply were high enough. Conversely if the demand were to slip to half of what it currently is (say a major recession or outright depression) the price would also collapse. The underlying inflation rate would still be relatively the same but would have little or no effect on the price of crude. And let us not forget that if not for OPEC the price of crude wouldn't be at these levels. If such an organization as OPEC were to operate in the U.S. and engaging in price fixing they would be indicted and carted off in orange jump suits. \n \n Is this so difficult to understand?

   "If someone else hasn't already, thought I'd add this:\n \n Even after last month's bumper gain in employment, there are 22,000 fewer private sector jobs than when the recession began in March 2001, a 0.02 per cent fall. At the same point in the recovery from the recession of the early 1990s, private sector employment was up 4.7 per cent.\n \n http://news.ft.com/cms/s/f269a8f4-c...000e2511c8.html\n\n \n As I said earlier, the left can always find the cloud in every silver llining. Nobody, but nobody has a grip on the underground economy that contributes another 2-3 trillion to our overall GDP. Those jobs are never reported. There are more and more \"contract\" type jobs that never find their way on the books. I do some occasional transport work for a local auto dealership. If I don't report it it'll never be known although I do declare it on my tax returns. There's a boatload of Mexican workers down by the railroad tracks. Want to estimate how many of those will be reported as \"employed?\" But much of their income will find its way into the local economy.",

   "Of course we will get still more gobbledegook about \"inflation.\" Even as the consumer price index has actually inched upwards recently leading to an increase in interest rates by the Fed. How can that be since \"inflation\" fuels price increases of crude?\n\n \n You just posted an article that CONFIRMED what I am saying. Also, do you understand the difference between consumer level inflation, which is calculated using a CPI, and treasury level inflation, which is something that is determined by the forex market? Never mind, don't bother answering, you obviously understand NOTHING about economics, or you owuld not have posted this article that makes you look even stupider than you previously did.\n \n I will translate this for you, since you pparently are unable to read english\n \n \nOil dropped below the $50 threshold on Thursday as a strengthening U.S. dollar extended a heavy fall driven by rising U.S. crude stocks and signs of slowing global demand growth\n\n \n Crude dropped because the dollar is up.\n \n \nPrices fell as the U.S. dollar hit a three-month high against the euro at $1.2741, extending gains made on a narrower U.S. trade deficit and as some investors bet on a strong U.S. retail sales report.\n\n \n Again, the dollar is up right now, so oil is down\n \n \nOil has been reluctant to make a decisive break below $50, because big-money investment funds have viewed any price drop as a buying opportunity. Even so, further gains in the dollar could place more downward pressure on oil, traders said.\n\n \n Oil has stayed above $50 because the $50 benchmark is seen as a bargain buy by institutional traders (which meeans that they think you are an idiot with you \"$28/bbl by next summer\" prediction, too). BUT, if the value of the dollar goes up, oil could go lower.\n \n \n\"It depends largely on what the U.S. dollar does. If the euro weakens to around 1.25, I think the funds will liquidate further length in oil,\" said Tony Machacek of Bache Financial in London.\n\n \n The price of oil depends on the value of the dollar. \n \n \nFalls in the dollar's value this year and last have helped lift oil prices, by insulating non-dollar economies from the impact of higher oil prices. Investment funds have also switched from treasury markets into commodities and energy.\n\n \n High oil prices are caused by a low dollar. \n \n \nInventories rose by 2.7 million barrels to 329.7 million -- a tweflth rise in the last 13 weeks and are now 30.3 million barrels higher than year-ago levels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.[/B]\n\n \n We have WAY, WAY more oil on hand than we can possibly use, so this is not a supply/demand related problem. It is soley due to the weakness of the dollar.\n \n \nSentiment was also dampened by a report from International Energy Agency (IEA) saying that high fuel prices were slowing oil demand growth in key markets China, Europe and the U.S.\n\n \n Not sure why you bolded this part, since it is pretty much unrelated\n \n \nFirst-quarter demand growth in the U.S. slowed to 250,000 bpd, or 1.2 percent, from 340,000 bpd, the IEA said.\n\n \n Demand 1st quarter was down (prices climed first quarter if you will remember)\n \n \nChina's demand growth slackened to 4.5 percent in the first quarter of this year from 19.3 percent a year ago. The West's energy watchdog trimmed its annual China demand growth projection by 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 470,000 bpd.\n\n \n Again, first quarter deamnd was slow, but prices still climbed.\n \n \n\"That would put more pressure on prices, particularly the downward forecast on Chinese demand. China has been the prime driver of global rise in consumption over the past year or so,\" said Daniel Hynes, at ANZ Institutional Banking.\n\n \n Yes, a glut on the market, which is what we have had for the last 6 months, will lead to decreased prices. Not NEARLY enought to account for the 65% increase in oil prices we have seen in the last 5 years, but enough to account for the 13% increase that other countries have seen.\n \n \nSome said the EIA's report of a mild rise in weekly U.S. gasoline stocks of 200,000 barrels, ahead of the summer driving season, could limit further losses.\n\n \n Our onhand gasoline is also running at a surplus\n \n \n\"The key was lower-than-expected production. Refiners are coming back from maintenance significantly more slowly than expected and East Coast refiners look to be having problems maintaining their light product yields,\" Paris-based SG Commodities said in a report.\n\n \n Surplus gasoline even at lower than expected production.

Still on the inflation bandwagon. You believe if you throw enough garbage up on the wall some of it will stick. I refer you back to the figures that date back to the 1970s. If, in fact the price of crude was pegged to inflation we would be paying about $150 a barrel. How can this be that we are now paying about $50 a barrel?\n \n You make a big deal about the basket of currencies and you don't have any idea of what you are talking about. The \"basket of currencies\" was a term loosely defined as the value of the currencies now comprising the Euro. It is essentially irrelevant except for the fact that the dollar has settled into its normal trading range like water seeks its own level. If I recall correctly, at the outset of the Euro it actually declined in value to about 85 cents on the dollar. That was undervalued. It has now come up to about where it ought to be and it should stay there, all other things being equal. If the dollar's value was the determining factor China wouldn't have pegged its Yuan to the dollar for the past decade. They, like the Saudis, are not very much concerned about the so-called declining value of the dollar. You could go to any Wal-Mart store and see for yourself that you can today buy goods for much, much less than they could be bought 10,15, 20 years ago. \n \n The world is currently using about 84 million barrels of oil per day. The U.S. uses about 20.7 million barrels a day. The Chinese use about 6.8 million barrels a day. Last year global oil used went up about 3.5% or nearly 2.8 million barrels a day. Of that the U.S. consumption increased 500,000 barrels a day and the Chinese (get this) increased their consumption 860,000 barrels a day. However, the consumption is falling to about 260,000 and 470,000 barrels a day respectively. And as a result, the price of crude is going down. Today, the price of crude settled in at $48.54 a barrel, adding to a $1.62 decline Wednesday triggered by a U.S. government report showing stockpiles at their highest since July 1999.\n \n Ball in your court, Mr. Inflation Man.",

How can this be that we are now paying about $50 a barrel?\n\n \n No, you did not \"provide figures that date back to the 1970's\". Are ou referring to figures that include the oil embargo, when an 8% decrease in supply increased prices by over 700% overnight? Are they adjusted for the fact that until 1986, the price of oil was pegged? \n \n I am not throwing garbage on the wall. I have provided sound rationale, provided the numbers and data to back it up, and refuted EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR CLAIMS. You, on the other hand, continue to spew mindless bull droppings. You have absolutly no idea what you are talking about, and it is abundantly clear.\n \n I am going to discontinue this conversation after this post, since you have yet to refute or even provide a challenge to even a SINGLE ONE OF MY CLAIMS. Unless there is anybody out there who would like to pipe up and say they think there is even a shred of credibility left in your argument. Then I will continue until that shred is gone.\n \n \nYou make a big deal about the basket of currencies and you don't have any idea of what you are talking about. The \"basket of currencies\" was a term loosely defined as the value of the currencies now comprising the Euro. \n \n \n Bull. this is just you trying to weasel your way out of the fact that you are as ignorant about the forex market as you are about all other markets. There are no currencies that currently comprise the Euro, you bafoon. The Euro is a fully convertible, free trading currency that has no backing. It is not made up of other currencies, it is not equivelent to trading a basket of currencies. It is its own currecy, and has absolutly nothing to do with the currencies it replaced or their values. Is that clear enough?\n \n \nIt is essentially irrelevant except for the fact that the dollar has settled into its normal trading range like water seeks its own level. If I recall correctly, at the outset of the Euro it actually declined in value to about 85 cents on the dollar.\n\n \n Bull. it declined to .60 until it became apparent that the Germans were propping it up, and then it settled in. Its target value at the beginning was to trade 1:1 with the dollar. Like water seeks its own level? Again, you are showing how stupid you are. Currencies do nto settle in like water seeking its own level. Currency values change daily, even by the second, with economic data from individual nations. \n \n \n\n That was undervalued. It has now come up to about where it ought to be and it should stay there, all other things being equal. If the dollar's value was the determining factor China wouldn't have pegged its Yuan to the dollar for the past decade. \n \n \n Bull. you are once agains displaying how stupid you are in these matters. The When china pegged the yuan to the dollar, it was a strong dollar. \n \n Additionally, people talk about the Euro in relation to the dollars because it is the primary dollar pack currency. Dollar pack currencies are a basket (a real basket of currencies, not the imaginary basket of currencies you thought composed the euro) of major currencies that re used to track relative strenght or weakness of the dollar. They are stable currencies that seldom show any real independant movement. Different brokers use different baskets (I use the Euro, cable, loonie, AUD, and NZD). The Yen used to be a prime dollar pack currency before they started actively devaluating it in order to stay competitive with the chinese. \n \n ANY major currency can be exchanged for \"Euro\" anywhere I have used it in this thread, and the relation remains the same. \n \n \n \nThey, like the Saudis, are not very much concerned about the so-called declining value of the dollar. You could go to any Wal-Mart store and see for yourself that you can today buy goods for much, much less than they could be bought 10,15, 20 years ago. \n \n \n You really are a XXXXX, aren't you? The chinese have decreased US dollar holdings by over 80% in the last 5 years. This implies to me that they see it goign down the toilet. The sauds have been instrumental in the rising cost of oil to compensate for the lower dollar, and they liquidated ALL dollar holdings in the last two years. \n \n We can buy things cheaper at wal mart today because wal mart stocks almost all cheap chinese junk. Over 60% of our total imports form china are destined for wal marts shelves. Unpeg the Yuan from the dollar and make it fully convertible, and you will not be able to change price tags fast enough to keep up with the rising prices.\n \n \nThe world is currently using about 84 million barrels of oil per day. The U.S. uses about 20.7 million barrels a day. The Chinese use about 6.8 million barrels a day. Last year global oil used went up about 3.5% or nearly 2.8 million barrels a day.

Your own article confirmed that this was the cause.\n \n If anybody out there has any questions about this, or feels that missouri mule has any credibility in financial matters left at all, please post them here so I can clarify. Otherwise, I am done here. MM has proven time and again through this thread that he is just too stupid to understand complicated financial matters. He has failed to refute even a single one of my points, though every opne of his has been refuted. It just isn't worth my time to argue with a XXXXX.

   "Well, it is obvious to me that you have reduced all the argumentation to one level and that is to pound on the table. It can be shown conclusively that inflation has no direct effect on the price of crude. You are one of these fools that believes the dollar is going into the crapper and we need to hide in caves somewhere until Bush leaves the White House. I gave you actual numbers, facts and figures in my last paragraph and you ignored those completely. You keep ranting and raving like a damn fool and your idiot friend chimes in to echo your nonsense. \n \n One more time: Supply and Demand. Take away the demand and the supply increases, and subsequently the price decreases. Increase the demand and the price inevitably increases. Decrease the demand and the price decreases (unless there is price fixing as occurs in OPEC.) And all of this is taking place even if our inflation rate moves not one whit nor moves in relation to the Euro or the Yen. \n \n For the other less insane members of this forum, consider this. If the price of crude would fall to $10 tomorrow morning because of increased supply or decreased demand, Daewoo would have to construct a framework to explain that deflation has occurred on the order of about 80% in order for him to argue that the price of crude is controlled by \"inflation.\" It is an absurd and utterly stupid argument made by a cretin who couldn't understand the first hour of Econ 101 at Podunk U.",
