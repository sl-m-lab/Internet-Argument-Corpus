   "Kidnappings in Iraq!!\n \n Do you think the kidnapping tactic will change what foreign countries do in Iraq?\n \n Do you think images of Japanese, Koreans or anyone else being burned alive will have an impact on the way other countries view their war effort? Will they want to send more troops or less troops to Iraq? What will happen to THEIR resolve?\n \n http://apnews1.iwon.com//article/20040408/D81QNLGG1.html\n \n \n 8 Koreans, 3 Japanese Kidnapped in Iraq\n \n \n Apr 8, 12:15 PM (ET)\n \n By JASON KEYSER\n \n AGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Iraqi insurgents kidnapped eight South Koreans, three Japanese and two Arab Israelis, and captors armed with automatic rifles and swords threatened in a video released Thursday to burn the Japanese alive if Tokyo does not withdraw from the U.S.-led coalition within three days.\n \n Two South Korean TV stations reported from Iraq early Friday that the South Koreans - Christian missionaires - had been released, but the Foreign Ministry in Seoul could not confirm that.\n \n In Tokyo, Japan's government said it has no plans to pull out of Iraq because of the kidnapping. It was the first such ultimatum involving foreign civilians taken hostage in Iraq, suggesting a new tactic by militants to pressure governments allied with Washington....\n \n On Al-Jazeera, an announcer read a statement he said came with the video of the Japanese in which the kidnappers issue a three-day ultimatum for Japan to announce it will withdraw troops from southern Iraq.\n \n \"Three of your sons have fallen into our hands,\" the Al-Jazeera announcer read. \"We offer you two choices: either pull out your forces, or we will burn them alive. We give you three days starting the day this tape is broadcast.\"",

It may be fair to ask the question of how the American colonists would have felt if France would have overthrown the British rule, had a long term militray occupation to protect us, helped install a government that they felt was best for us, etc.\n I realize that the analogy is not perfect, but perhaps such a question will help us understand why many people in Iraq aren't thrilled about the American presence. I know that we always see ourselves as the good guys, that we can do no wrong, but I think that if you are not an American, you probably don't feel that way.

I think that you are overlooking, though, that people in Iraq don't know what the nature of our occupation is. They don't know when we are going to leave, and what we are going to allow of a government. And the longer we are there, the longer we seem like an occupying force that is not going to leave. Again, I don't think everyone trusts the US as much as you do. And really, why should they trust us? We certainly have been known to prop up puppet governments that are favorable to the US even if they don't have popular support.

Speaking from an emotional perspective...if they do stuff to this guy, we need to forget all about civility over there in Fallujah. No more of this cease-fire ****. We're fighting animals over there. We need to go all-out on these people.\n\n \n Why do you think the US is going after a ceasefire? We have significant advantages in manpower, technology, and strategic position. This is not the time to call for a cease fire unless:\n \n 1. There are massive civilian casualties and you want to shut it down before the cat gets out of the bag\n 2. You have forces cut off inside the city and want to use the cease fire to get them out of there\n 3. You realise that your troops are not well enough supported to continue an assault in an urban combat situation\n \n DO you have any idea what kind of logistical nightmare you are talking about in rooting out rebels in a city the size of Fallujah? THe closest I can come to a comparison is Freetown, Sierra Leone. It is comparably sized to Fallujah and had a similar situation when rebels took part of the city. In order to root out the rebels, battle hardened mercenaries (and I mean real ground pounding battles, not riding around in armored vehicles after your air force has knocked out most of the opposition) had to do a house to house, door to door search while being supported by over 4500 ECOMOG (the UN \"peacekeepers) troops. \n \n In Fallujah, you are talking about less than 2000 marines most of whom are not battle hardened and most of whom are not experienced in urban combat. Add to that the fact that US troops are not very well trained in urban combat to begin with, and the fact that things like armored vehicles and air support are of limited (if any) help in an urban combat situation (vehicles can be blocked and destroyed fairly easily and helicopters are not very effective against rebels who can easily duck into buildings) and you have effectively removed Americas biggest advantages over the rebel forces (superior technology and numbers). The rebels know the city, the Americans have maps (which is not the same) and the rebels know, and apparently have the support of, the population.\n \n Looking at some of the different articles about what is going on there, such as the one at http://www.freep.com/news/nw/iraq12_20040412.htm (detroit free press) which says:\n \n \n //quote//\n The slowdown in fighting was a welcome respite at Fallujah. Marines took advantage of the stand-down to reinforce their positions, a Marine statement said. \n //end quote//\n \n THis implies that numbers 2 nd 3 above are petty major factors in the cease fire. THere have probbaly not been enough civilian casualties to really cause major embaressment, especially since we can claim that all the dead were rebels (we would have to kill an awful lot of litle kids and women before the opposition could prove otherwise).\n \n People get all worked up over this and say things like \"we just need to jump in there and kick the hell out of these folks\". We are already doing what we can. WHile we have plenty of troops to go in and defeat an army, we need a LOT more guys if we are going to have to fight an enemy that is not clearly defined and is interspersed with the civilian population. \n \n IT seems that now there is talk of a negotiated settlement. THis may be the better way to go. regardless of whether you think these people are animals or not, our military is designed to roll over foreign armies, not to fight guerilla forces in an occupied country. It was not the chinese troops or the vietnamese regular army that cost us the war in vietnam, it was the VC and the sabateurs.",

Soldier dying because a bunch of civilians are throwing hissy fits back home and coming up with their own solutions to problems is not a good thing\n \n \n \nlooking at hands won't do much\n if i was an insurgent besieged i would pick up any and all weapons i could\n both to use to fight and to cast blame for civilian deaths\n\n \n I think we have our wires cossed here. I am talking about a general guidlines that soldiers in the field use to decide who is an isurgent and who is not (ad it tends to be a pretty good guideline). As far as those already dead, from our prospective, you just have to assume that any man of military age was an insurgent. If that is not the case and lots of innocents are being killed, we will find out soon enough becasue there will be a lot more insurgents to deal with (as people see a bunch of innocents in their town killed, they tend to pick up arms against the invaders).\n \n \nthere was an article i read this morning of mothers pressuring their young boys, most in early teens, to take guns without ammo to fight.\n\n \n This absolutly flies in the face of logic. First of all, it is highly doubtful that amother is going to pressure her son to go off ad fight. I don;t care where in the world you are. Second (and the nail in the coffin of this one) why would they send them off to fight without ammo? This is just stupid. Most of hte Iraqi rifes are AK-47's. The AK-47 shoots a 7.62x39 round. LAst time I was in the middle east, most GAS STATIONS were seeling cases of 7.62x39 ammo i thousand round cans. THere is plenty of ammo for the insurgents, so why in the world would somebody send their children off to fight without ammo?\n \n We have this real problem with accuracy in our perceptions of other people. e believe these are evil people we are dealing with, so we attach every cruel, inhuman, thing we can to them. Thi one, though, has the makings of an urban legend. It has a moral (though it is not a good one). Theya re SO EVIL that thier mothers don;t love their young sons, and send them off to fight knowing there is no chance they will return. \n \n This is just stupid\n \n I read an article at the beginning of the war about how Iraqi women throw infant children out into the street if they were girls. That story was a bunch of **** too.",

   "While it would not surprise me to hear that 15 yr olds are being used in combat in the middle east. 15 yr olds are considered to be men there. They don't coddle their children forever like we do, they let them grow up. It is a question of necessity. Life is hard in the middle east and peole have to grow up fast.\n \n I can say for certain that the linkl you posted is bogus info. there are two reasons for this. THe first is that, while my german is not great, I can follow the link back from that page to the original german page and stumble though well enough to know that is not how arabs talk to each other. It is a pretty good example of how westerners seem to think that Arabs talk to each other. I also took a look at the qoqaz forums where they claim the original is posted and could not find it anywhere (and my arabic IS good enough bet on). Even if the message really is there and I missed it (whihc is suppose is possible), why wouldl they link to the qoqaz homepage instead of directly to the message they are allegendly quoting?\n \n THe second reason we know this is BS is that there are only two places in Ramadi where there is internet access. One is in the old palace (now the marine headquarters). It is a dedicated sat link. THe other place is in the internet cafe, which is inside the American base (camp junction city) there and is only available to US servicemen. The internet cafe ALSO uses a dedicated sat link. Even before the war, before we wiped out a good part of the Iraqi phone system, only 3% of iraqis had internet access, and there has never been internet access in ramadi.\n \n In order for this article to be factual, either the two brothers are american servicemen, or they snuck into the servicemans internet facility so they could IM each other from across the room. \n \n According to the german page (which as a lot more of the actual conversation than the enblish translation), one of the aleged brothers says he is going to print a copy of the conversation ans well as send it to other people and post it ont he internet. This would imply rather heavily that he is claiming ot be using a computer as opposed to a cell phone.",

It's a big city and all one needs is a satellite dish... of which there are plenty in Iraq.\n\n \n The only company that offeres sat internet in the middle east is bentley communication. It requires a 72 CM dish and they have refused to serivce Iraq (thoughit is possible to get reception there). They are reselling bandwidt on tachyon system birds which operate on spot beams, so you acannot buy your service in another country and then move your dish to IRaq (this is the same way directv and dish network provied blackouts in some areas). It is also incredibly expensive. the guy in the conversation reports that he has been fighting. rich arabs (the only fols who could afford bentleys price) do not fight, They hire others to do it for them. \n \n \nWhat I can add about the German original:\n - The 2 involved men are said to be brothers.

THere is a page at http://www.redtailcanyon.com/places/4354431.aspx that is a forum for wives of guys who are in ramadi. A lot of them are upset because their significant others haven't called them since the fighting in Ramadi started. This is apparently because the US troops immediatly pulled the plug on all local phone service to isolate the rebels from outside help. They have apparently not reconected them except ofr a brief period 2 days ago, and in that case it was just 3 phones at the presidential palace (so not all the guys got to call home).\n \n I peruse several Arabic language boards (oddly enough, there I am viewed as anti-arab, while several here seem to think I am anti-american) and at the start of the war there were a bunch of weird posts (like one about how Iraqi women routinely toss baby girls into the street because they don;t wnat girls). \n \n Personally, I think it is quite possibly a person, or persons, that is simply spreading propoganda.

Also in the wars in the former Yugoslavia young boys were often armed; I won't even get into Russia's military history....\n \n The \"mothers\" part is just propaganda, to dehumanize the enemy...its an accepted method in all \"Western\" wars (and most others too!) Though I don't doubt that sometime, somewhere, some mother urged her young son to go and fight, it is the exception rather than the rule. Its amusing because if you watch the various propaganda coming from various nations, its all the same stuff, each side saying that the others are monsters...If you watch al-jazeera you will see propaganda demonizing americans, if you read american press quite a few will have stories demonizing Iraqis. Its reciprocal. A funny example is the story that the germans told their people during WW2 that Americans and British soldiers would toss babies into the air and shoot them or cut open the bellies of pregnant womena and kill the baby, of course this is not true (remember the execption comment), Yet in the USA and Britain the same story was repeated verbatim, except for Germans were substituted for the Americans and British.\n \n While I definately want all of our boys to come home safe, I can understand the animosity some Iraqis feel towards our troops. If a motar shell hit my home and killed my son or daughter, even if the foreign army did it by accident (how would I know that, and it probably would'nt matter anyway) I would be hell bent on some type of revenge.\n \n Even though we take precautions to prevent civilian casualties, they do happen in large numbers, its a unfortunate side effect of war. Even if you that figure 50 civilians have been killed in Fallujah, when you multiply it out with people and their whole families/friends/neighborhood out looking for revenge it makes the militants recruiting that much easier.\n sorry for the long post",
