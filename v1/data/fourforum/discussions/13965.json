Although it is not provided for in the formal rules of the Senate, the procedure is the subject of a 1957 parliamentary opinion and has been used on several occasions since.

   "JP, that right, but possibly you could have added a little more depth to those 'unbiased' facts: \n \n Democrats are trying to defuse criticism of their attempts to pass the same federal healthcare reforms that the American public has already rejected and they are trying to pass it through the legislative process of reconsiliation. They are doing so by claiming that Republicans have used the process of reconciliation in the past. This is true. However it is also true that Republicans have not passed any legislation through the process of reconciliation that dealt with any major national overhaul of anything that was not limited to the federal budget.\n \n That difference is essential and the reason for the essential difference between Republican use of reconciliation regarding budgetary matters and Democrat attempts to use the process for healthcare reform is as follows.\n \n The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 created a &#8220;Reconciliation&#8221; process that was meant to deal strictly with the budget. It was specifically meant to be used regarding the passage of budgets effecting a single fiscal year and primarily on proposed spending and revenue legislation that was being dealt with at specific points in the budget process.\n \n Then there is this. In 1985, long serving West Virginia Democrat Senator Robert Byrd championed an amendment to the reconciliation process that would prohibit its use for any action that would effect the deficit beyond 10 years after that specific reconciliation measure was passed. This is why the Bush tax cuts were created to last for only ten years. During Bush&#8217;s presidency, the three major tax cuts that he was responsible for, were passed by reconciliation and to satisfy the requiremens that t reconciliation called for, the tax cuts were limited to the ten year clause of the reconciliation process.\n \n These are the facts which limited Republicans to the proper use of reconciliation. They are important facts, facts that Democrats are leaving out when they accuse Republicans of having used reconciliation in the past, and then try to claim is the reason why Democrats can use it to pass a government takeover of healthcare in America in the future.\n \n The claim is a half truth and an attempt to decieve. The reasons for that conclusion are as such.\n \n First, the Democrat healthcare takeover scheme most certainly effects the budget beyond the 10 year mark that reconciliation required.\n \n Second, the proposed government healthcare takeover contains legislative initiatives that deal with far more than taxes or the budget which is effected by taxes. It is a major reform of a significant portion of the national economy, places mandates on individuals and businesses, increases the size of government and creates new government panels, bureaus, departments, and agencies, changes regulations and reforms the process of health treatment decisions.\n \n This goes far beyond anything that reconciliation was ever meant to deal with.\n \n It is also MOST important to know this additional crucial fact.\n \n In 1993, when Hillary Clinton wrote the healthcare reform proposal that Bill Clinton was championing, he tried to pass it through reconciliation. However; Democrat Senator Robert objected on the grounds that healthcare reform was so broad, that it effected and dealt with much more than reconciliation theoretically allowed for.\n \n Now, 17 years later, reconciliation is suddenly alright to use for passage of healthcare reform?\n \n NO! IT IS NOT ALRIGHT! It is wrong! It was wrong then and it is wrong now.\n \n So while Democrats may gain some traction by trying to label Republicans as hypocrites because of their own use of reconciliation in the past but now object to Democrats use of it, a look at the facts, is proving that Democrats are lying through their teeth.\n \n Republicans never passed a major overhaul of life in America with a simple partisan majority. Furthermore; they never passed a major overhaul of life in America over the objections of the American people. \n \n To be sure, elections have ramifications. As a result of the 2008 elections, Democrats have complete control over the House, the Senate and the White House. As such, Republicans must understand that those majorities can and will be used to pass legislation that Republicans may oppose. However; one of the ramifications of the 2008 election should not be the illegal use of a process that is designed to insure that a clear and somewhat bi-partisan majority is used to pass any legislation that significantly changes life in America.\n \n So any attempts to paint Republicans as hypocrites on the issue of reconciliation is not only dishonest, it is evidence of a conspiracy to mislead the American people and an attempt for Democrats to abuse their power through the improper use of the reconciliation process.\n \n The more Democrats push this, the more excuses they make and the more they try to deceive the American people and advance legislation that the American people oppose, and try to do so through a process that they oppose, the harder Democrats shall fall in the coming months. And from there, rapidly, shall the presidency of Barrack Obama begin to unravel and the liberal majority in Congress will quickly begin to fade away into ineffectiveness and obscurity.\n \n Stop the lies. If the President and the liberal led Congress truly want bipartisanship, than stop trying to find a way to pass a major overhaul of American life through partisan measures. http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474978066125\n \n And Simone....you are truly the clueless.",

   "JP, that right, but possibly you could have added a little more depth to those 'unbiased' facts: \n \n Democrats are trying to defuse criticism of their attempts to pass the same federal healthcare reforms that the American public has already rejected....\n\n Get real! The American public has definitely not rejected health care reform.\n \n.... The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 created a \"Reconciliation\" process that was meant to deal strictly with the budget. It was specifically meant to be used regarding the passage of budgets effecting a single fiscal year and primarily on proposed spending and revenue legislation that was being dealt with at specific points in the budget process.\n \n Then there is this.

During Bush's presidency, the three major tax cuts that he was responsible for, were passed by reconciliation and to satisfy the requiremens that t reconciliation called for, the tax cuts were limited to the ten year clause of the reconciliation process.\n\n Um... consider this:\n \nNPR's Julie Rovner has a fantastic article explaining that the reconciliation process has actually been used for almost all major pieces of health-care legislation passed over the past 20 years. COBRA -- which stands for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, but has come to mean the much-beloved program that lets you keep your health insurance when you lose your job -- was done in reconciliation. The Children's Health Insurance Program was done in reconciliation. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which is the legislation that tells hospitals that take Medicare and Medicaid that they have to at least screen any patient who enters the emergency room, regardless of insurance status, was done through reconciliation. Welfare reform, which disentangled Medicaid from welfare, was done in reconciliation.\n \n Need I go on?\n \n Elsewhere, political scientist Joshua Tucker found a Congressional Research Service report (pdf) listing every time reconciliation was used between 1981 and 2005, and he built a rough model testing which party used the process more frequently. During that period, there were 19 reconciliation bills, 11 of which were signed by Republican presidents, five of which were signed by Democratic presidents, three of which were vetoed by Democratic presidents, and none of which were vetoed by Republican presidents. \"By my admittedly simple classification scheme,\" Tucker concludes, \"this would suggest that 14 of the 19 times reconciliation was used between FY1981 - FY2005, it was used to advance Republican interests.\"\n \n Ezra Klein - The recent history of reconciliation\n \n NPR link:\n Health Care No Stranger To Reconciliation Process : NPR\n \n Joshua Tucker link with links to other venues:\n The Monkey Cage: Which Party Uses Reconciliation More Often? Looks like Harry Reid was Correct\n \nThese are the facts which limited Republicans to the proper use of reconciliation. They are important facts, facts that Democrats are leaving out when they accuse Republicans of having used reconciliation in the past, and then try to claim is the reason why Democrats can use it to pass a government takeover of healthcare in America in the future.\n\n Yeah, to advance Republican interests, like more money piled onto the super rich and more money taken away from me.\n \nThe claim is a half truth and an attempt to decieve. The reasons for that conclusion are as such.\n\n Reconciliation was used by Democrats to create Medicare, SCHIP, try to take that away from the American public and see how long you live.\n \nFirst, the Democrat healthcare takeover scheme most certainly effects the budget beyond the 10 year mark that reconciliation required.\n\n That remains to be seen. It depends upon whose budget projections you refer to.\n \nSecond, the proposed government healthcare takeover contains legislative initiatives that deal with far more than taxes or the budget which is effected by taxes. It is a major reform of a significant portion of the national economy, places mandates on individuals and businesses, increases the size of government and creates new government panels, bureaus, departments, and agencies, changes regulations and reforms the process of health treatment decisions.\n\n As opposed to the huge health insurance bureaucracy which essentially operates to deny health care to those supposedly insured in health insurance?\n \nThis goes far beyond anything that reconciliation was ever meant to deal with.\n\n Says you.\n \nIt is also MOST important to know this additional crucial fact.\n \n In 1993, when Hillary Clinton wrote the healthcare reform proposal that Bill Clinton was championing, he tried to pass it through reconciliation. However; Democrat Senator Robert objected on the grounds that healthcare reform was so broad, that it effected and dealt with much more than reconciliation theoretically allowed for.\n \n Now, 17 years later, reconciliation is suddenly alright to use for passage of healthcare reform?\n \n NO! IT IS NOT ALRIGHT! It is wrong! It was wrong then and it is wrong now.\n\n Again, says you. Why shouldn't Congress move forward on health care reform? That's what Americans had in mind when they voted in 2008.\n \nSo while Democrats may gain some traction by trying to label Republicans as hypocrites because of their own use of reconciliation in the past but now object to Democrats use of it, a look at the facts, is proving that Democrats are lying through their teeth.\n\n Who can forget icky, dirty little Tom DeLay and the passage of Medicare Part D, the biggest pile of legislative crapola ever manufactured:\n \nAs exhausted lawmakers walked off the House floor, Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) grabbed Billy Pitts by the arm.\n \n \"We're still friends,\" Dingell told the Republican Rules Committee staff director, \"but that was one of the most shameful things I've ever seen.\"\n \n It was dawn on Nov. 22, 2003. After keeping the vote open for nearly three hours, the House had just delivered President Bush a major victory by passing its Medicare prescription-drug bill less than a year before the election.\n \n The drug benefit, which will be available to senior citizens Jan. 1, is the most sweeping change to Medicare since the program's inception four decades ago.\n \n Economists and healthcare experts predict that the new entitlement will prolong lives but that in its current state it also will confuse seniors and create a financial headache for policymakers when the bulk of the baby boomers retire.\n \n Republicans also took a huge political risk by passing the bill. Right now the benefit's impact at the ballot box is uncertain; it could be a political asset - or a liability - for Republicans in the 2006 elections.\n \n The bill's passage was years in the making. When the Republican-led House passed its first drug-benefit bill in 2000, it was projected to cost $40 billion over five years. Three years later, the price tag had ballooned to at least $395 billion over 10.\n \n High-profile bills that call for major policy changes usually pass Congress with significant bipartisan support. The Medicare bill, however, was an exception, passing by the narrowest of margins. The fate of the measure, which will affect millions of Americans, ended up in the hands of just a few rank-and-file members.\n \n While the bill barely survived a procedural vote in the Senate, the House vote was historic. Lawmakers say it was the most intense environment on the floor in decades.\n \n Two years later, The Hill interviewed lawmakers, congressional aides, and administration officials to recount the events of what Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) - who led the conservative rebellion against the bill - has dubbed \"the longest vote.\"\n \n Never before had a roll call been left open so long. When Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) announced the 15-minute vote (the normal length of time provided for most House votes), at 3 a.m., yawning lawmakers were hoping to be in bed within the hour.\n\n http://www.groundzerofortomdelay.com/modules.php\n \nRepublicans never passed a major overhaul of life in America with a simple partisan majority. Furthermore; they never passed a major overhaul of life in America over the objections of the American people. \n \n To be sure, elections have ramifications. As a result of the 2008 elections, Democrats have complete control over the House, the Senate and the White House. As such, Republicans must understand that those majorities can and will be used to pass legislation that Republicans may oppose. However; one of the ramifications of the 2008 election should not be the illegal use of a process that is designed to insure that a clear and somewhat bi-partisan majority is used to pass any legislation that significantly changes life in America.\n\n \nIt doesn't have specific bearing on the viability of using the budget reconciliation process to enact substantial health care reform, but this bit of history from Pete Davis helps us understand the context:\n \nWhen the Budget Act was enacted in 1974, reconciliation was envisioned as the final accounting at the end of the fiscal year containing spending cuts and tax increases to bring the budget deficit back to the level approved in the original budget resolution. The idea was to circumvent the normal impediments, like the Senate's filibusters and never ending amendments, to achieve deficit reduction. The first reconciliation bill at the end of 1980 fit that conception, as tiny as it was, but the next reconciliation bill, President Reagan's 1981 tax cut used reconciliation to enact the largest tax cut in U.S. history. Former GOP Congressman and OMB Director David Stockman's brain child, using reconciliation to expand the deficit with massive tax cuts to take away the federal government's credit card, worked like a charm legislatively, but spending took off anyway, particularly for defense, leaving record high peacetime deficits that persisted until 1997.\n\n Should Reconciliation Be Used To Pass Health Reform? | Capital Gains and Games\n \n The point is not to praise Reagan or to condemn him, but simply to note that by and large that 1981 reconciliation bill was \"the Reagan Revolution.\" And since that time there just haven't been any comparable huge structural shifts in the direction of US domestic policy. It's not really clear that modern conditions leave any other feasible route to such legislation until such time as some Senate majority decides to change the filibuster rule. \n\n \nSo any attempts to paint Republicans as hypocrites on the issue of reconciliation is not only dishonest, it is evidence of a conspiracy to mislead the American people and an attempt for Democrats to abuse their power through the improper use of the reconciliation process.\n\n Matthew Yglesias The History of the Reconciliation Process\n \nThe more Democrats push this, the more excuses they make and the more they try to deceive the American people and advance legislation that the American people oppose, and try to do so through a process that they oppose, the harder Democrats shall fall in the coming months. And from there, rapidly, shall the presidency of Barrack Obama begin to unravel and the liberal majority in Congress will quickly begin to fade away into ineffectiveness and obscurity....\n\n No, it's the American people pushing the Democrats to push this legislation through.",

   "Senate Health Bill Would Up Costs for Millions in Middle Class, Analysis Finds\n \n A nonpartisan study is casting new doubt on President Obama's campaign pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class.\n \n The Senate health care bill crucial to saving President Obama's signature domestic initiative will hit the wallets of a quarter of all Americans making less than $200,000 per year, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee that assessed the way the bill would hit taxpayers directly through new taxes and fees and indirectly through taxes levied on health care providers and passed on to consumers.\n \n The committee also determined that the bill would subsidized insurance premiums for 7 percent of taxpayers -- about 13 million people -- while some 73 million people would face higher costs from the new fees and taxes.\n \n The potential tax increases in the bill could pose significant problems for the president as he makes his final push for health care reform because he promised to protect middle-class Americans from any tax hikes. Republicans already are pouncing on the committee's analysis.\n \n \"For every family that gets some benefit from this program, in other words, a premium subsidy, three families are going to get a tax increase and those three families obviously include the bulk of people you'd call middle class America,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told Fox News.\n \n FOXNews.com - Senate Health Bill Would Up Costs for Millions in Middle Class, Analysis Finds\n \n We knew Obama was a lying snake when we first listened to him. Now he's breaking ANOTHER PROMISE to the American people.\n \n Why were you pro-Obama Kool Aid drinkers so gullible?\n\n \n Do we need a STUDY? emoticon_confusedemoticon_rolleyesemoticon_xbangheadxcensored",
