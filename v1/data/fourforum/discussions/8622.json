   "Hey, guys do we need Georgia as full fledged member in NATO? No good idea methinks. Recent events in Kodori Gorge in Georgia added meat to my doubts. Definitely, Georgia under hawkish Saakashvili is going wrong way far as her relationship with NATO is concerned. His escapade in Kodori Gorge is actually big worry.\n It clearly testifies to the fact Saakashvili has been maturing rather militarily than politically. I picked it up somewhere that military budget of Georgia has been taking off in recent time. It has been 135% (!) rise in the last year only. Saakashvili's placed hell of troops in Kodori and so far he has removed only tiny part of them out of there. It's 10% or so. So Georgian military withdrawal from Kodori is mere fiction. Saakashvili is fooling us! And he is leaving lots of weaponry there. Surely it is destined to support Abkhazian govt in exile loyal to him. \n What's in reality? In fact he seems to be firmly set to plant by forceful means the govt in Abkhazia many Abkhazians are not willing actually. This means guerilla wars in the nearest perspective already. Generally, Saakashvili sees Kodori as beachhead for further military adventures to settle his disputes with autonomies. This will lead to series of wars imo. \n Well, bearing in mind NATO new concept of the \"broader territorial responsibility\" we are to be involved in this mess. Amid our Iraqi campaign isn't it too much? It would be scaring indeed. I think NATO and Saakashvili just see many things differently. Am I right? So Intensified Dialogue with Georgia is not what we need now imo.",

   "Georgia in NATO is a challenge for the alliance I think. In a nutshell, the country is sack of problems. It has a long path to go yet to matured democracy if any. There's no full-fledged opposition, no real freedom of speech in Georgia... to say nothing about inner stability. Some national minorities in Georgia are feeling just oppressed and claim living separately from Tbilisi as independent states. Well, on top of that in recent times Georgia is playing footsie with Muslim countries. The major worry is Iran 'course. Iran is ardent critic of USA and EU. And now it is set to make huge investments into Georgia and supply her with energy resources and all that. This sort of relationship between Georgia and radical Iran makes the Georgia's membership in NATO XXXXX chance imo ... at least ion the nearest perspective. At least the question we need to ask now is, 'Whose interests is Georgia going to serve in the alliance?'",
