   "Reading my daily Krugman today to see what the left is thinking...\n Op-Ed Columnist - The Third Depression - NYTimes.com\n \n He seems to think we are headed for the third depression...great job Einstein! I don't take exception to the idea we are heading for a depression, I think the reasoning behind it is wrong. \n \n Krugman suggests that the fiscal responsibility ideas congress is obsessed with now (and most of Europe is obsessed with now) will send us into a long depression. Crazy talk huh? Probably not. I agree that once the stimulus money ends and if we stop huge deficits that we will probably suffer for a number of years. What I disagree with Krugman about is that keeping up stimulus and raising huge deficits will work. The idea that stimulus \"jump starts\" the economy is false. It helps until the money runs out. On smaller scales we have seen this with the \"cash for clunkers\" were car sales dropped the months after the credit ended. We saw it with the housing tax credit that led to home sales decreasing 33% in May. I problem with stimulus is that it prolongs the inevitable. When the money runs out the fall occurs; and that is why people like Krugman think it is the \"fiscally responsible\" folks that cause the fall...but really he is just thinking shortsightedly. \n \n Thoughts?",

   "Stimulus works so long as it has purpose beyond spending - running deficits to invest in infrastructure to support recovery as well as drive it directly is more sensible than just pumping money in. Stimulus needs to be eased off over time, not stopped.\nIn reality we have never been able to ease off anything that has been around for a substantial amount of time so even if that did work (which it wouldn't) we would end up in a bad situation. Furthermore, you'd be running the deficit so long that it would be unsustainable. Finally, I doubt there is any infrastructure we could build quickly enough that would attract the relevant businesses for growth (although I agree infrastructure needs to be something we spend money on again). I mean it takes over 10 years to build a simple road.\n \n \nKeynesian economics is about smoothing, the idea is to ease off on spending and raise taxes during the boom even if it slows growth somewhat, so that when the crash comes you can avoid the worst of the dip.\nGood in theory but in practice it doesn't work. The government has no idea how to smooth. More importantly, we don't have those stacks of money saved up for a rainy day. \n \n \nThe sort of immediate, savage cuts planned by David Cameron and his fellow ideologues have the potential to kill the recovery stone dead and lock in a spiral of inflation and recession for many years to come.
