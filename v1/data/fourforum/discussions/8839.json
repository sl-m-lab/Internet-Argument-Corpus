Also, be aware of what the primary revolution of the 21st century will be:\n \n \nNicholas Kristof on a \"worthless\" woman\n I don't know how Nicholas Kristof does it. \n The New York Times columnist has repeatedly written that he believes \"the central moral challenge of this century, equivalent to the struggles against slavery in the 19th century or against totalitarianism in the 20th, will be to address sex inequality in the third world.\" True to that conviction, he now spends the better part of his time stationed in Sudanese refugee camps, South Asian brothels and Middle Eastern war zones, ferreting out women's stories of courage and cruelty and bringing them to the world. \n \n This week finds Kristof in Khanpur, Pakistan -- where Aisha Parveen, a former sex slave who escaped from her brothel and married a man she loved, faces adultery charges brought against her by the very man who was her one-time captor. If Parveen is convicted of adultery, Kristof writes, \"then her supposed husband, [the pimp], will bail her out and take her away. Ms. Parveen says she believes he will then rape and torture her, and finally kill her.\" \n \n In other words, Kristof writes, \"the judicial system, while ignoring the sex trafficking of children, may now, in the name of morality, hand a young woman over to a brothel owner to do with her as he wants.\" The hearing that will decide Parveen's fate is today. \n \n Though sex trafficking now gets a lot of media play in the West, Kristof claims that global change is slow because \"the victims tend to be the least powerful people ... poor and uneducated rural girls.\" He writes, Aisha Parveen \"is simply one more impoverished girl from the countryside, and if her brothel's owner goes ahead and kills her, almost no one will care.\" \n \n It's heartbreaking to think so. But I have a hunch that after seeing Parveen's story in the New York Times, there are now thousands of readers who would disagree. -- Sarah Karnasiewicz\nFrom Salon's Broadsheet.",

   "September 17, 2006 \n Op-Ed Columnist \n 'Save My Wife' \n By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF \n YOKADOUMA, Cameroon \n Prudence Lemokouno was lying motionless on a bed in the bleak hospital here, her stomach swelled with a fetus that had just died, her eyes occasionally flickering with fright but mostly dull and empty. \n \n Dr. Pascal Pipi, the lone doctor in the public hospital, said she had a few more hours to live, and then she would join the half-million women a year who die around the world in pregnancy and childbirth. \n \n Her husband, Alain Awona, was beside himself. \"Save my wife,\" he pleaded. \"My baby is dead. Save my wife.\" \n \n In the spring, I held a contest to choose a student to take with me on a reporting trip to Africa, and now I'm on that trip with the winner, Casey Parks of Mississippi. I had wanted to introduce Casey to the catastrophic problem of maternal mortality in the developing world, because it should be an international scandal that the number of women dying in pregnancy worldwide has been stuck at a half-million for a quarter-century. \n \n Indeed, here in Cameroon the maternal mortality rate has risen since 1998, and over all an African woman now has one chance in 20 of dying in pregnancy. In much of the world, the most dangerous thing a woman can do is to become pregnant. . . .These women die because they are poor and female and rural - the most overlooked and disposable people throughout the developing world. . . . \nOh, pregnancy.

   "Released June of 1999 \n An Open Letter to Eddie Vedder\n When is a woman not a woman?\n \n Therein lies the only clear refutation of a woman's rights.\n A woman's rights -\n seems a mere tautology, a redundant catch phrase.\n Are not rights self evident?\n Intrinsic assumptions of the inalienable?\n So, when is a woman not a woman,\n a right not a right?\n \n When she doesn't exist.\n \n When does a woman become a woman? \n \n Is it when\n her first ballot has been cast? \n Or when \n she graduates from her class? \n \n Is it when\n she makes a wish on her sweet sixteenth? \n Would I be amiss if it were her first kiss?\n \n Is it when \n she's diagnosed by the boy next door?\n Or as ambiguous as the cutting of the cord?\n \n Is it the time\n it takes to travel the distance through the canal?\n Or when\n she's kicking and becomes viable?\n \n Is it when\n her sex is discovered by a sonogram?\n Or after eight weeks when \n the changes in her body will be mainly in dimension?\n \n Is it when \n her brain waves are detected after 40 days?\n Or is it around three weeks when \n her primitive heart beats? \n \n Can there be only one true line of demarcation?\n One finite measurable point in time that differentiates\n life from non-life?\n Womanhood from non-womanhood?\n Rights from no right?\n \n Is it the moment of conception -\n that point when all of the above is set in motion?\n That precise moment when\n \"a separate human individual, with her own genetic code,\n needing only food, water, and oxygen, comes into existence\"?\n \n Indeed,\n It is at that point,\n \"like the infant, the child, the adolescent,\n that the conceptus is a being who is becoming,\n not a becoming striving toward being.\n \n She is not a potential life,\n she is a life with great potential\".\n She is not the mother,\n she is an other -\n a somebody other than the mother.\n \n A woman,\n however beautiful, however complex when fully grown,\n begins life as a single cell, a zygote -\n that stage in human development through which we all pass.\n She fulfills \"the four criteria necessary to all life -\n metabolism, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction.\n Her genetic makeup is established at conception,\n determining to a great extent\n her own individual, physical characteristics\":\n her eyes, her hair, her skin color, bone structure, her gender. \n \n So let us not be confused,\n \"she did not come from a zygote - she once was a zygote.\n She did not come from an embryo, she once was an embryo.\n She did not come from a fetus, she once was a fetus\".\n She did not come from a little girl - she once was a little girl.\n \n When is a woman not a woman?\n The answer is absolute, non-negotiable.\n To argue against would be to ignore the innate,\n the fact of the matter.\n The answer can never be a matter of opinion or choice.\n This is not a metaphysical contention.\n This is biology 101.\n The answer is scientifically self-evident -\n as inherent as the inalienable.\n \n Therefore,\n the ability to pursue happiness\n is contingent upon liberty -\n her liberty,\n and her freedom is solely dependent upon\n the mother of all human rights...\n \n the right of life.\n \n Respectfully,\n Gary Cherone\n (June 1999)\n [Quotations by Francis J. Beckwith] \n http://www.rockforlife.org/archives/commentaries_liferightsandrocknroll.html",

You are saying that, no matter what, you have to stop a life. If that is the case then every time a sperm does not fertilised or an egg is not fertilised you are preventing that \"life\" from maturing. I think that in this situation the choice is obvious. Either risk loosing both( one of which already has a many relationships and maybe even provides for a child) or lose one and have a chance to have another baby. I have no problem with abortion in this scenario, but I still wish it was done before any pain could be felt by the fetus. Do they still just cut them out without killing them first?\n \n \nWell, this is impossible but some 90% (about) abortions are carried out for reasons that do not effect serious health issues or death.

I think god is looking at pro-lifers like he looked at slave owners, white supremicists, and nazis. God doesn't judge people. People judge people, but not God. We anthropomorphize God all the time, and its a common mistake that i can forgive you for.\n \n There is also no hell. If God was so ritious, then why the hell would he send us to hell? It makes no sense, because we have no sufficiant evidence of his existance, so why would he make a hell. The way you percieve God, he sounds more like \"Satan\".\n \n God would not be evil enough to force women to be pregnant. Women arent God's baby slaves, and they will do as they wish with their bodys. I really dont think God cares about aborting fetuses or not. Again, its the woman's buisness, not his, not yours. I'll bet he views it as wrong once the baby is out of the, err, stomach, but when its a bunch of embryotic cells, I honestly think he gave women the descision of what to do. In my opinion, everything happens for a reason.\n \n And BTW, read the constitution. Church and State are SEPARATED, which means religious zealots like yourself cant make religious laws.

   "An abortionist's sink full of bloody, dismembered babies somehow makes more sense to you. That's beautiful.\n\n \n You can quit bringing up propoganda inspired pics from late term abortions. I know the reality - they are rare, rarely performed unless absolutely needed. This isn't an effective tactic with me. \n \n \nPeople should then consider that before copulating. Killing the innocent victim isn't a very good solution.\n\n \n Maybe they did. Maybe birth control failed or circumstances changed.\n \n \nGo tell it to your pet carp. That's nonsense. \n\n \n Actually I think you hate just about everybody. If this is how you treat folks I question anyone can be bothered with your company at all.\n \n However, demonizing every woman stuck in a hard place, refusing to acknowledge she may have real life circumstances that maybe if considered could broaden her choices, and wishing to use pregnancy as a punitive measure is not only hateful towards her, but also towards any child. \n \n \nWhat's a 'zealot'? Someone who believes in God more than you do?\n\n \n A small minded, child-like thinker who can't see part their own ideas or in shades of grey.

You don't care who you bulldoze. You don't care about changing hearts and minds. If you did you would understand that cruelty does not work. A zillion people, even those who agree with you, have pointed out that your methods don't work. You don't care. You are right and because of it have the privelege of being an XXX to anyone who disagrees. It's how you operate. You are here to stroke your own ego.\n \n \nNuts. Try teaching personal responsibility and consequences and then show them a sink full of bloody infants, and see it that kind of reality shakes anyone up. If not, they're probably hopeless.\n\n \n I agree with teaching responsibility - early on. Let kids see the realities of parenting without money, have them talk to an AIDS patient on their death bed. SEX EDUATION - that stresses abstinence but includes all options. Teach girls that the world does not have to focus on men and change our behavoir to match. MORE help for pregnant women - especially poor ones - options so they can stay in school, FMLA enforcement even for part-timers, bills get paid, kids get fed, etc if she is on her own and that pregnancy means she won't be able to work. Counseling to help scared kids face parents. Medical care. A little less condemnation and little more acceptance. More hugs and fewer sermons. \n \n You bloody sink image may be emotionally disturbing but it won't change their circumstances one ioto. Nor does you demonization, trivialization, or the criminalization of abortion.\n \n If you want to help - shut up and help. Your sharp tongue does abosolutely NOTHING. You won't fix anything with it and you will not change a mind. Keep it up and you will prove that you are in this for your own gotta be righteous, self-absorbed, political motivations.\n \n Even Max, who I disagree so vehemently with, I believe actually cares. I don't buy it from you. Nothing in your mean, politically driven preaching indicates that you really care about pregnant women, women in general or their babies.\n \n \nIs someone from America officially targeting innocent babies and others? Seems to me that's what the terrorists are doing. \n\n \n I don't condone it from anyone. I just question why you find the killing of children an acceptable consequence if there there is good reason when carried out by the men of your administration, yet you can find no reason in a woman's life?\n \n \nAnd how do you propose doing that? And where's your pro-choice for the innocent baby? Who is the baby's advocate while you pursue fanciful solutions?\n\n \n The average infant can't make a choice let alone a fetus.

Don't worry, he either won't admit it or he will try to justify it.\n \n \n \n Whatever his age, he's old enough to have built up a VERY healthy sense of self-importance and superiority, but not old enough to act in a mature, civil or humble manner.\n \n BTW: I'm sorry for getting off topic, but I'm not going to sit back and let someone act like an :xcensored while trying to portray me as just that.\n\n \n \n You're hilarious, you really are. There you go with personal attacks again. It seems you have neither read my post, nor your own post. You are using childish personal attacks again, and its only making you look bad.",

   "Your right, you have every right to be conceited. I have every right to point out just how conceded and pathetic you truly are. As for as your name, I assumed that you were a male because most people one here are, I think. Honestly, I wouldn't expect this level of immaturity from a female. I really don't care how dumb you think I am, as long as people can see that your conceitedness FAR exceeds my ignorance.\n\n \n You never stop hurling personal attacks at the people here do you? I find it funny that a 14 year old is acting more mature than a 25 year old.\n \n And so you cant make false claims such as \"you didn't read the post\", i have read all posts thoughraly. You certainly are getting a little childish with zingers such as \"as long as people can see that your conceitedness FAR exceeds my ignorance\" or \"I have every right to point out just how conceded and pathetic you truly are\".",

   "I'm not in the least qualified to judge your level of intelligence. However, it does seem to me that you are not very well informed and that you have a mind that is closed to learning new stuff.\n\n \n I could easily say the same about you. The truth is that I don't agree with you and that is why you think I am so pathetic. I just don't appreciate the unwarranted attack on my intelligence. I AM open to \"learning new stuff\". What \"stuff\" have I been closed to? I do not agree with everything that has been said in this post but am I supposed to? No, I'm merely stating my opinion, just like everyone else in this thread. If you disagreed with the post that you quoted you could have debated the issue. Instead, you choose to attack my intelligence. If you would like to debate the issue, I'm fine with that.\n \n \nYou're hilarious, you really are. There you go with personal attacks again. It seems you have neither read my post, nor your own post. You are using childish personal attacks again, and its only making you look bad.\n\n \n Here's the scenario:\n \n Simone attacks me out of nowhere, I defend myself and make a few accusatory remarks, you attack me for defending myself, I refute your claims and make a few remarks about your unwarranted attack and respond to simone's claim the she has \"a right to be conceded\", you attack me again.\n \n Do you not see that I was attacked first? The FIRST insult in this thread, between simone and I, was \"And, would you care to have me translate what I have just said so that you can understand it on your level of understanding?\". I honestly don't understand why you think I attacked simone first. SIMONE, please inform Shooterandproud that you questioned my intelligence before I defended myself. I don't go around attacking people and to have to defend myself for defending myself is ironic. If you have read all of the posts, you need to go back and read them slower.\n \n \nYou never stop hurling personal attacks at the people here do you? I find it funny that a 14 year old is acting more mature than a 25 year old.\n \n I find it funny that you are willing to attack me without comprehending what has truly transpired. That's not maturity.\n \n And so you cant make false claims such as \"you didn't read the post\", i have read all posts thoroughly. You certainly are getting a little childish with zingers such as \"as long as people can see that your conceitedness FAR exceeds my ignorance\" or \"I have every right to point out just how conceded and pathetic you truly are\".\n\n \n Yeah, I am pointing out what I perceive as simone's flaws. I'm simply returning the favor.",
