   "\"Sin is: before God in despair not to want to be oneself, or before God in despair to want to be oneself\" so said Soren Kierkergaard \"The Sickness unto Death\", Penguin Classics, p113.\n \n I've been thinking about this and I think what he's trying say is that sin is despair. Despair is lack of faith in God...\n \n \n \n Currently I have some time to write on these posts as I have leave from work to look after a sick relative; when she's not in immediate need. I was filled with despair at another prospect of another operation. I stopped daily prayers and going to Church. This despair, this lack of faith in God, I now realise is a sin.\n \n Despair must be a product of my lack of faith, my lack of trust in God. Regardless of what happens, I believe that trust in God is paramount.\n \n I'd be interested to hear from other Christians especially as to their thoughts on despair - is it the greatest of sins?",

   "In a sense, I believe it is my failing to trust God... \n \n Over the past months I've been vascillating in my opinion of God...\n is he actively condeming my family to sickness\n or\n is he just allowing cancer to happen\n \n both of these are bad options.\n \n But, in reading a bit, and thinking about friendship the other day... and the trust that people who are friends must share, I feel that deep down I shouldn't be so full of despair, and put my faith in God.\n \n I have also been keenly aware of the hypocricy of debating on this forum when I myself am not showing the faith that I should.\n \n I am still trying to resolve these issues... I have promised my priest I'll go to Church two Fridays from now... at least for a talk being held by a visting cleric, but that is not a promise that I feel I can return to active church life.\n \n \n I thank you for your considered thoughts.",

   "Montalban:\n \n Despair is an interesting word to use. One comforting thought that has helped me is that God sees eternally and our lives are eternal. It is where we will spend them. I will pray for you and your relative. God does allow sin and trauma into the life of a believer. He allowed His Own Son to be crucified at the hands of non believers for no reason. Everytime that I feel a victim and am in despair of my circumstances I remember that. He allowed it (remember Jesus did not defend Himself before Pilate) because of the \"prize set before Him\". \n \n That prize is us! What greater joy than that we should be able to spend eternity with Him. Do not focus on your sin. it will only cause you to sin more. instead let you mind wander on things of good repute, on the spiritual matters, on God. This will overcome your despair. He who is in you is greater than He who is in the world.",

   "epaphras_faith thank you for your post.\n \n What shocked me, perhaps more was just how quickly I lost faith. I was a regular church-goer; earlier this year I'd go Friday (for Complin Service), Saturday (for Vespers) and Sunday (for Divine Liturgy).\n \n Obviously then internally I am/was a weak Christian...\n \n This shocked me also because on Christmas Eve last, I was so full of faith that I stood up to a crazy dude...\n \n I got on the train at Parramatta and the next stop this man got on saying \"I f*cking defile Christ, I ... defy Christmas, etc.\"\n \n I'm a fairly big bloke, and although I said nothing to him, I looked him square in the eye, and took my crucifix out from inside my shirt and hung it on the outside.\n \n He shut up after that. As I say, I'm a big bloke, and if pressed could have put him away.\n \n I find it easier to actually confront someone, but sickness is not something that you can head-butt.\n \n Despite being quite strong, externally, I was wearing a paper-thin faith.",

   "montalban there is something seriously wrong with your thinking\n \n god would not punish you through giving cancer to your loved ones, think of how sick that is, if god would punish you for your stray of faith it would be you not your loved ones.\n \n how can you ever be truley faithfull if you do not doubt, doubt is not a sin but how humans can truley find out what they beleve in.\n \n who knows you may not beleve in god afterall, if you do not give yourself the right to doubt you are not exercizing the greatist gift that god has givin you.\n \n if you doubt and search for your own aswers rather then just accepting the 1s that are told to you, then your faith and understanding in what god is will be stronger and justified.\n \n it just disturbs me that your saying to think freely and of your own mind is a sin, that is not a sin of god but a sin that man has created for you so u will not doubt god.\n \n i dont know much about the bible but look through it all the profits and storys told. Are those storys of people that simply listend to what they were told or are those storys of people who searched for truth and in there search for truth found god.\n \n im not to good at writing so im not sure if i really got what i feel through this. Well im kinda on the run i might come back and put more time into it later.",

   "well my mind is still in a jumble but another thought came to me.\n \n isnt it obvious that god does not judge you in this world, god does not stop hitler from killing, he does not punish people through deasease or in any phisical way in this realm. Cant you see that on this world we are truley free, if you beleve in god u must accept that this world is the place where god lets us go and lets us make are own decisions and forge our own path. that is what free will is all about (which i saw you mentioned somewhere) so do not be afraid that you may doubt god will not judge you until your time comes. Kinda like a person on death row for doing horrible things, will he go to heaven if he simply listens to what his minister says and just puts his faith in god, i think he would have a better chance if he explored his thought and was true to himself to find what his soul really accepts.\n \n remember we are created in gods image, so everything that we do, even killing and doubting, god understands.",

You will find it. Guaranteed. Remember Romans 8:1 and when I feel despair or a lost faith I turn to the Psalms where David pours out his heart to God. He cries out in anger and frustration but always finds his way back. It is really amazing to me. Your faith is not weak any more than any other man. God created us this way to depend on Him.
