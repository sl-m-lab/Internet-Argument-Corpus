Not many debates get pulled through so many topics.\n \n I have a really big problem trying to say that someone or something is responsible for a persons criminal actions. This goes for kids and adults. Teenagers are old enough to know right from wrong. The root cause for a teen shooting up a school is that teen pulling the trigger on the gun. It's not the medias fault, it's not the schools fault. It's a person who can't cope with life's daily stressors normally acting out in a violent manner. \n \n I understand that personal responsibility is a dying ideal in this country, but I think it's about time we at least tried to bring it back.

I don't feel that people are taught self control. \n \n We live in a \"do what you feel\" society. We are taught that it is very important to \"express yourself\". Sometimes, it is best NOT to do what you feel, or to express yourself. \n \n I do think that those guys at Columbine did what they did becasue they were picked on until they couldn't take anymore. I also think that their threshold was pretty damn low. Kids can be cruel, but if you can't handle being picked on in high school, you are going to have some real problems in life. \n \n You get bullies expressing themselves by picking on and beating the heck out of people, then you end up with a couple of kids \"doing what they feel\" and blowing away a bunch of classmates. \n \n In my travels, I have found this to be the biggest noticable differenct between America and other cultures. Other places, people generallyu have self control. In America, it is hit or miss.\n \n I think that violence on TV and in movies probably didn't help, since I do agree that it desensitizes people. The core problem, though, is a lack of self control. It is time for America to quite telling its children how important it is to express themselves, and teach them that self control is one of the most important skills that they will ever develop.",

   "This is not likely to be a popular opinion.\n\n \n I for one agree with it and would like to add my thoughts. (and might as well make some enemies with my first post)\n I find fault with the mindset of today's youth as instilled in them by their teachers.\n \n Today's youth have been fed the gruel of \"self-esteem\" from an early age and this indoctrinated non-judgmental theory is biting us in our rump. Kids are told from the earliest age that they are an outstanding person, that it is \"not fair\" to judge others or yourself. \n \n \"Johnny, just because you had 14 out of 20 questions wrong, does not mean you are a bad person, you had six right, you are a beautiful snowflake!\" \n \n So our kids are told not to get down on themselves because they fail at such un-important normal tasks; judging is wrong . . . to enhance themselves they should express themselves in whatever manner they wish. Green spiked hair? OK. Multiple facial piercing? OK. Do whatever makes you \"feel good about yourself.\"\n \n Then the contradictions come; UH, wait, you can't say this, or that. A rare few ever find out that their contrived \"individuality\" is nothing but diversion to ensure conformity; to question authority or the conventional classroom wisdom as dispensed by the \"teacher\" is frowned upon.\n \n They quickly learn that such empty, indoctrinated self esteem is like lounging in a Jacuzzi. The warm water and bubbles feel great, and one could delude themselves into thinking that it will never end. Soon though they are forced to get out and go out into the cold, harsh world. That bitter wind is often first felt in others' negative views and opinions of them. Puberty sets in with all the self doubt and worries of fitting in and they begin to learn the very hard lesson that not everyone thinks they are an outstanding person. In fact, some people think they're a jerk and wouldn't urinate on them if they were on fire. When that happens, egotism is threatened. Teenagers usually react in one of three ways. \n \n 1, They put on the \"down parka\" of a healthy, true self-image, based on a moral code, their accomplishments, character and ethics and an understanding that life is not always kind or fair. They strive to work harder and better their situation regardless of what others may think, or their motivations.\n \n 2, Since they have only been told that they are wonderful and never understanding why they are wonderful, they simply lower their self-esteem, say \"I don't deserve to be warm and comfortable\" and withdraw to a corner and \"shiver\" alone, in the worst cases, they contemplate suicide. \n \n 3,Those with an anti-social bent maintain and nurture their unwarranted high self-esteem by manifesting negative emotions toward either the source of the ego threat or, most often, those weaker and of lesser social status. In one form, this is exhibited as bullying behavior. On the opposite spectrum, with a bully's victim['s], it becomes a \"who the F' do they think they are screwing with . . . everyone must pay\" directive to punish the slights against them. From that comes the Columbines.\n \n As a side note, I find it interesting that many here wish to frame the school violence problem in only the headline making shooting massacre genre. That is like trying to discuss the dangers of electricity and only discussing lightning . . . This problem exists on so many levels, to reduce it to the rarity dismisses the everyday hurt that our kids experience.",

   "Everyone says that they want more rules or more enforcement of rules in the schools until it is their little Johnny or Susie and then they want an exception because teachers don't \"understand\" the situation. Schools are nothing more than a reflection of the society at large. Do we live in a violent society? Yes. Do we see people getting away with breaking the rules? On so many levels, it's not even funny! Until we give schools the right to operate according to stated principles, with due process rights (yes, schools and teachers make mistakes, too) for students/parents, and insist to the public at large that we WILL provide a safe environment for our students, we are simply keeping violence down to a low roar and hoping for the best.\n \n On bullies.

   "emoticon_idea \n \n You know, there wouldn't be any school violence if there weren't all these schools around. We need to clean this up.\n\n lol\n \n Anyways, I don't know about most of it, but mostly it seems it starts off with \"harmless\" playing around or playfully shoving someone in a locker, etc. Most of the time bullies think it's all in fun, but when they're face to face with a gun they don't think it's so funny anymore.\n \n I recently watched the movie \"Bang Bang you're dead\" and it's about a school where a kid is bullied and pushed over the edge to make a bomb threat. It's a pretty good movie, if not a happy one :)\n \n But basically I think the problem is that kids are encouraged to be independant so when something like that happens the kid bottles up all the anger inside. They don't want to show they're mad so people assume they're fine (including their parents) but one day they have to do something and they bring a gun to school.\n \n But the main problem is people like those posting. \n \n \"There have always been bullies in school, we all remember them.\"\n \"Blaming the big bad bully in school is not helping matters at all.\"\n \n But the point is that having a zero tolerance (zero brains) policy towards bullying, anything is not the way to go about preventing it. They need to really be able to know when something such as bullying is going on since the kids sure aren't going to tell a teacher about it. These kids are all human, and they get pis$ed before they bring weapons to school. We need to be able to realize a kid is at that point before he breaks. This is the parents/frineds/teachers responsibility. They should know the kid well enough to help him before he breaks and brings a gun to school.\n \n Back to bullies, you cannot think of them as always there and unpreventable. Every human being in America is forced to go to school, the least we can do for them is make sure they are safe from harm. I don't care how the world is, school should be a safe place. If a kid can't feel safe at school (where the majority of his time awake is spent) then where can he? If school is a living hell then how much is he really going to learn. Have we really stooped so low as to have high school just another step to natural selection? Only people smart enough and with social skills good enough to survive and graduate get past?\n \n And I really don't think TV/music/whatever is to blame for violence. How many times do you just decide to do what's on TV? Rather I think TV/music is a reflection on society. If TV didn't exist our society would still be the same and I don't think people are at the point where they think ahead far enough to realize that they are taking a person's life FOREVER.\n \n Anyway, that's my rant for the day.",

   "According to Zachvac, I am one of those people who post statements like this:\n \n \"There have always been bullies in school, we all remember them.\"\n \n Anything taken out of context is useless. The rest of the statement was that students need to be taught the consequences of their actions, which is part of the solution to the problem of bullies and victims. It was also in reference to bullies always being a part of the landscape, but one didn't hear about school shootings until the last 15-20 years. So obviously something else is going on with young people outside of just being bullied, or we would have had school shootings throughout the history of mandatory schooling.\n \n A question. Why should schools be safe places when the world outside of the schools are not safe? Those unsafe places include the child's home (domestic violence at all time highs), the neighborhood in many instances(street crimes), and the world at large. Don't get me wrong, I wish the schools could be an oasis of safety for students, and in many cases, they are the safest place that many kids will be on any given day, but if kids bring the outside problems into the schools with them, only so much can be done at the school level. I always enjoy reading posts that say the school personnel should be doing more to safeguard the students and should know the students as well as their parents do because kids are at school all day. Let's analyze this idea. The parents have the children for the first 4-5 years of life depending on whether the kids go to kindergarten or not. Students generally get out of school sometime between 2:30 and 3:30 depending on the grade level and most don't go to bed until 8:00 (young) -11:00(older). That's 51/2 - 71/2 hours that a parent could spend with their children. Ah, you say, but most parents work and don't get home until at least 6:00. Sorry, but that is the parent's choice. And yet many insist that the teachers should know the children as well as the parent does. I'm not quite sure how everyone else does math, but in my case I have 30 students per 55 minute class period, 5 classes per day. If a parent can't tell when something is up with their children, for argument's sake, let's say they have a large family by today's standards, 4 children, how in the world does anyone expect me, as the teacher to know my students on a deep level? I try very hard to note behavioral changes, but unless they are really obvious (sleeping in class, sudden disruptive behavior not present before, etc.) I am probably not going to pick up on a subtle change. I always love the parents who come in to a conference, usually initiated by the teachers because of a concern, and the parents ask us what they should do about their child because the kid won't listen to them or do what they say. Again, what is it you would like me, the teacher to do with your child? You gave birth to the child, raised him/her for the first 4-5 years, can choose to spend time with the child after school and on weekends, and can choose to make and enforce rules for your child from a very early age. Ultimately, I can only have an influence on your child for 55 minutes/day during which time they are 1 of 30, and I am also supposed to teach them something about the subject matter of the class along the way.\n \n Possible solutions to school violence lie in addressing societal problems at large such as, poor parenting, gratuitous (sp) violence in the media (no it doesn't teach kids to be violent, but it sure does give some ideas), corruption at the highest levels with no consequences for their actions, glorification of street gangs, drug culture, the fast buck with no hard work involved, apathy about the importance of an education whether it be college, trade or vocational school, the value of a work ethic, unbridled consumerism, the idea that the world owes one something simply because one is breathing, and the list goes on and on.\n \n Public schools were not designed to raise the children of our society. They were designed to teach subject matter and to reinforce appropriate behavior learned at home, or correct inappropriate behavior, but not be the teachers of appropriate behavior. If society now wants the schools to teach all aspects of life to youngsters, say so, then get out of our way, quit interferring when we do something you don't like and let us do our jobs. OR if schools are to do what they were designed to do then YOU raise YOUR children and we will teach subject matter and reinforce appropriate behavior and correct inappropriate behavior.\n \n I'm sorry to tell you this, but you can't have it both ways. Please chose one, so we can do our jobs to your satisfaction.",
